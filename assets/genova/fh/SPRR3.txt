# SPRR3

## Overview
SPRR3, or small proline-rich protein 3, is a gene that encodes a member of the small proline-rich protein family, which is characterized by a high proline content. The protein product of SPRR3 plays a significant role in the formation of the cornified cell envelope (CE) in keratinocytes, contributing to the skin's barrier function and structural integrity. SPRR3 is involved in cross-linking proteins within the CE and has antioxidant properties, aiding in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through its cysteine residues. This protein is also implicated in various cellular processes, including DNA binding and interactions with other proteins, influencing pathways such as the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Clinically, SPRR3 has been associated with several cancers, where its expression levels and interactions can impact disease progression and prognosis (Vermeij2012Proteomic; Li2020&lt).

## Structure
SPRR3 (small proline-rich protein 3) is a member of the small proline-rich protein family, characterized by a high proline content that influences its structural properties. The primary structure of SPRR3 is rich in proline and glycine, contributing to its rigidity and repetitive sequence pattern (Vermeij2012Proteomic). The secondary structure of SPRR3 is predicted to include repeating β-turns in its central domain, forming an ordered spring-like structure. This is largely due to the proline content, which affects the protein's rigidity (Vermeij2012Proteomic).

SPRR3 proteins contain lysine- and glutamine-rich N- and C-terminal domains, which are involved in transglutaminase cross-linking, essential for the formation of the cornified envelope in the skin (Vermeij2012Proteomic). The presence of cysteine residues allows SPRR3 to form disulfide bonds, which are crucial for reactive oxygen species (ROS) quenching and contribute to its antioxidant function (Vermeij2012Proteomic).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur, impacting the protein's function and interactions (Vermeij2012Proteomic). However, specific details about the tertiary and quaternary structures of SPRR3 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
SPRR3 (small proline-rich protein 3) plays a crucial role in the formation of the cornified cell envelope (CE) in keratinocytes, contributing to the skin's barrier function. It is part of the epidermal differentiation complex located on human chromosome 1q21 and is expressed in the upper layers of cornifying tissues. SPRR3 is involved in the cross-linking of proteins within the CE, which is essential for maintaining the structural integrity and biomechanical properties of the skin (Vermeij2012Proteomic).

SPRR3 also has a significant role in antioxidant defense. It helps detoxify reactive oxygen species (ROS) through its cysteine residues, which can quench ROS and form an antioxidant shield. This function is particularly important during wound healing, where SPRR3 aids in cell migration and tissue repair by reducing oxidative stress (Vermeij2012Proteomic).

In addition to its structural and antioxidant roles, SPRR3 is involved in DNA binding, potentially contributing to DNA protection or regulation. This activity is influenced by the redox state of the protein, with monomeric forms binding DNA more efficiently (Vermeij2012Proteomic).

## Clinical Significance
The SPRR3 gene has been implicated in various cancers, with its expression levels and interactions playing significant roles in disease progression. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), high SPRR3 expression is associated with poor prognosis and increased hazard ratios for overall survival, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic marker (yang2023SPRR3). In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), SPRR3 is upregulated and correlates with advanced tumor stages and metastasis. Its knockdown reduces cell growth and invasion, indicating its role in tumorigenesis and potential as a therapeutic target (Dysregulation; p&gt; Li2020&lt).

In colorectal cancer, SPRR3 is significantly upregulated in a majority of tumor samples, promoting cell proliferation and lymphovascular invasion. This upregulation is linked to AKT activation and decreased p53 levels, contributing to cancer progression (Cho2010Upregulation). Conversely, in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), SPRR3 is downregulated, and its exogenous expression suppresses tumor growth by promoting apoptosis, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role (Zhang2007Exogenous).

In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), SPRR3 is frequently hypomethylated and overexpressed, which is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Its upregulation enhances tumor cell proliferation and invasion, indicating its involvement in GBM pathogenesis (LIU2013Expression).

## Interactions
SPRR3 (small proline-rich protein 3) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), SPRR3 interacts with c-Jun and Fra1 in human bronchial epithelial cells, playing a role in the phosphorylation of AKT, which is significant in breast cancer and colorectal tumorigenesis (Dysregulation; p&gt; Li2020&lt). In cardiac fibroblasts, SPRR3 facilitates the interaction between PDGFRβ and integrin β1, crucial for fibroblast proliferation and matrix synthesis. This interaction is demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation and in situ proximity ligation assays, showing that SPRR3 is essential for the colocalization of these proteins (Saraswati2020Small). SPRR3 also plays a role in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, as seen in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), where it regulates cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. SPRR3 knockdown leads to decreased phosphorylated Akt levels, indicating its positive regulation of this pathway (Wu2022SPRR3). In the context of skin cornification, SPRR3, along with other SPRR proteins, is involved in forming the cornified cell envelope and detoxifying reactive oxygen species (ROS) through its cysteine residues, which allow it to form disulfide bonds and quench ROS (Vermeij2012Proteomic).
