# EIF2AK1

## Overview
EIF2AK1 is a gene that encodes the protein eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 1, commonly referred to as the heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI). This protein is a kinase that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of protein synthesis, particularly under stress conditions. EIF2AK1 is primarily known for its function in erythroid cells, where it helps coordinate hemoglobin synthesis with heme availability by sensing heme concentrations and modulating the phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α). This modulation is crucial for the integrated stress response (ISR), allowing cells to adapt to various stressors such as heme deficiency, heat shock, and oxidative stress. The activity of EIF2AK1 is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and ensuring cell survival under adverse conditions (English2021A; Krishna2018Molecular; Boone2023Signaling).

## Function
EIF2AK1, also known as the heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI), is a kinase that plays a crucial role in regulating protein synthesis in response to various stress conditions, particularly in erythroid cells. It is primarily involved in maintaining heme levels within cells and coordinating hemoglobin synthesis with heme availability. In healthy human cells, EIF2AK1 functions by binding to heme at its N-terminal end, which triggers intermolecular autophosphorylation, allowing it to sense heme concentrations. Under conditions of heme deficiency, EIF2AK1 becomes activated and phosphorylates the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α), leading to a reduction in general protein synthesis while selectively upregulating stress-responsive transcription factors like ATF4 (English2021A; Krishna2018Molecular).

EIF2AK1 is also activated by other stressors such as heat shock, osmotic shock, and oxidative stress, contributing to the integrated stress response (ISR) by forming stress granules and modulating translation initiation (English2021A; Boone2023Signaling). This regulation helps maintain cellular homeostasis by remodeling the proteome and transcriptome in response to stress, ensuring cell survival and function under adverse conditions (Boone2023Signaling).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EIF2AK1 gene, which encodes the heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI), are associated with Leukoencephalopathy, Motor Delay, Spasticity, and Dysarthria (LEMSPAD) syndrome. This condition is characterized by symptoms such as motor developmental delay, white matter abnormalities, speech disorders, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The specific heterozygous de novo missense variant in EIF2AK1 leads to reduced levels of phosphorylated eIF2α, indicating a loss of function that impairs HRI's kinase activity. This impairment potentially disrupts the integrated stress response (ISR), particularly under stress conditions like mitochondrial stress, and may increase cell sensitivity to HRI activators, resulting in increased cell death (English2021A).

Alterations in EIF2AK1 expression have also been implicated in gliomas, where the gene is significantly overexpressed compared to non-tumoral brain tissues. This overexpression is linked to increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis in glioma cells, suggesting that EIF2AK1 could be a potential therapeutic target in these tumors (Marina2019Relevance).

Additionally, EIF2AK1 has been identified as a modifier gene in Huntington's disease, with genetic variants potentially influencing the age of onset. Increased expression of EIF2AK1 may be associated with a later onset of the disease, highlighting its role in neurodegenerative disorders (Wright2019Gene).
