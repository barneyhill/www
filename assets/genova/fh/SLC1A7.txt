# SLC1A7

## Overview
The SLC1A7 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 1 member 7, also known as excitatory amino acid transporter 5 (EAAT5). This protein is a transmembrane transporter primarily expressed in the retina, where it plays a critical role in visual processing. EAAT5 functions as both a glutamate transporter and a chloride channel, contributing to the regulation of neurotransmitter levels and chloride conductance in retinal neurons. By maintaining synaptic transmission and preventing excitotoxicity, EAAT5 is essential for proper visual function. The protein's interaction with synaptic proteins, such as PSD-95, and its regulation by kinases like SGK1 and SGK3, underscore its involvement in complex signal transduction pathways within the retina (OlivaresBañuelos2019Glutamate; Beart2007Transporters; Kanai2004The).

## Function
The SLC1A7 gene encodes the excitatory amino acid transporter 5 (EAAT5), which is primarily expressed in the retina. EAAT5 functions as both a glutamate transporter and a chloride channel, playing a crucial role in visual processing by regulating neurotransmitter levels and chloride conductance. This transporter is associated with rod photoreceptors and some bipolar cells, where it helps maintain synaptic transmission and prevent excitotoxicity by controlling extracellular levels of L-glutamate (Beart2007Transporters; Kanai2004The).

The transporter currents elicited by glutamate in EAAT5 are largely carried by chloride ions, indicating a prominent chloride conductance. This feature is similar to the glutamate-elicited chloride conductances previously described in retinal neurons, suggesting that EAAT5-associated chloride conductance may participate in visual processing (Kanai2004The). The presence of EAAT5 in the retina highlights its specialized role in the visual system, contributing to the precise regulation of synaptic activity and neurotransmitter clearance, which are essential for proper visual function (Gesemann2010Phylogenetic). Understanding the function of EAAT5 is important for insights into retinal physiology and potential therapeutic interventions for visual disorders.

## Interactions
The SLC1A7 gene encodes the EAAT5 protein, which is primarily expressed in retinal neurons. EAAT5 is involved in synaptic signaling and is characterized by its interaction with PDZ domains in the PSD-95 protein. This interaction is facilitated by a motif present in the C-terminus of EAAT5, which is common in synaptic membrane proteins. The binding to PSD-95 suggests that EAAT5 is part of a signal transduction pathway, potentially playing a role in retinal physiology beyond its function in neurotransmitter clearance (OlivaresBañuelos2019Glutamate).

The regulation of EAAT5 activity is influenced by serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinases 1 and 3 (SGK1 and SGK3), which increase the cell surface abundance of the transporter. Conversely, EAAT5 activity is downregulated by compounds such as threo-β-hydroxyaspartate (THA) and L-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid, indicating that its function can be modulated by specific inhibitors (OlivaresBañuelos2019Glutamate). While specific protein interactions involving SLC1A7 beyond those with PSD-95 are not detailed in the provided context, the presence of these regulatory mechanisms highlights the complexity of its role in retinal neurotransmission.
