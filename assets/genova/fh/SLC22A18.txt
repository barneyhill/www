# SLC22A18

## Overview
SLC22A18 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 22 member 18, which is part of the larger solute carrier family known for facilitating the transport of organic ions across cellular membranes. This protein is characterized by its structure, which includes 10 transmembrane domains, and functions primarily as an efflux transporter-like protein. It plays a significant role in cellular metabolism and drug sensitivity, with notable expression in neuronal tissues such as the cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus (Chu2011Promoter). The gene's expression is intricately regulated by the transcription factor Sp1 and is influenced by methylation patterns. SLC22A18 is also involved in lipid metabolism, particularly in the liver, where it contributes to lipid degradation processes (Ito2019Knockdown). Its clinical significance is underscored by its role as a tumor suppressor, with aberrant expression linked to various cancers and other syndromes (Qiao2022A; Song2024The).

## Function
SLC22A18, a member of the solute carrier family 22, encodes a protein involved in the transport of organic ions across cell membranes. This protein is characterized by its 10 transmembrane domains and functions as an efflux transporter-like protein, influencing cellular metabolism and drug sensitivity (Chu2011Promoter). In healthy human cells, SLC22A18 is expressed in neurons, particularly in regions such as the cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus, but not in astrocytes or oligodendrocytes (Chu2011Promoter). The gene's expression is regulated by the transcription factor Sp1 and is dependent on methylation, but independent of histone acetylation (Chu2011Promoter).

SLC22A18 is also implicated in lipid metabolism, as its knockdown in HepG2 cells leads to the accumulation of triacylglycerol-rich lipid droplets, suggesting a role in lipid degradation (Ito2019Knockdown). This accumulation is linked to reduced lipophagy, evidenced by decreased expression of autophagy-related proteins (Ito2019Knockdown). The gene's involvement in lipid metabolism is further supported by its expression in the liver, where it is present at both mRNA and protein levels, indicating a role in hepatic function (Ito2019Knockdown).

## Clinical Significance
The SLC22A18 gene, located on chromosome 11p15.5, is implicated in various diseases due to its role as a tumor suppressor. In gliomas, SLC22A18 expression is significantly decreased compared to adjacent brain tissues, with this downregulation linked to increased post-operative recurrence. Aberrant methylation of the SLC22A18 promoter is a major mechanism for its downregulation in gliomas, contributing to tumor progression and recurrence (Chu2011Promoter). In colorectal cancer, SLC22A18 acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting colony formation and inducing G2/M arrest. Variants such as p.Ala6Thr, p.Arg12Gln, and p.Arg86His are associated with lower expression levels and increased cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, potentially serving as biomarkers for disease progression (Song2024The).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), SLC22A18 is hypomethylated, with significant differences in methylation levels between tumor and non-tumor tissues, suggesting its potential as a biomarker (NogueraUclés2020The). Additionally, SLC22A18 is linked to a syndrome characterized by variable allergies, short stature, and fatty liver, where high methylation and low expression are associated with the syndrome's symptoms (Qiao2022A).
