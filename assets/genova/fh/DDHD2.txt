# DDHD2

## Overview
DDHD2 is a gene that encodes the DDHD domain containing 2 protein, a member of the intracellular phospholipase A1 (PLA1) family. This protein is characterized by its involvement in lipid metabolism and intracellular membrane trafficking, primarily through its phospholipase activity. The DDHD2 protein contains several distinct domains, including the WWE domain, tandem SAM (sterile alpha motif) domain, and the DDHD domain, which are essential for its catalytic function and membrane localization (Maruyama2018Loss; Gonzalez2013Mutations). The protein plays a critical role in maintaining cellular membrane integrity and dynamics, as well as in protecting against oxidative stress by regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels (Maruyama2018Loss). Mutations in the DDHD2 gene are linked to autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia type 54 (SPG54), a neurodegenerative disorder, and have also been implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (Matoba2020Common; Gonzalez2013Mutations).

## Structure
The DDHD2 protein is a member of the intracellular phospholipase A1 (PLA1) family and is characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function. The primary structure of DDHD2 includes a sequence of amino acids forming specific domains such as the WWE domain, the tandem SAM (sterile alpha motif) domain, and the DDHD domain (Maruyama2018Loss; Gonzalez2013Mutations). The DDHD domain is crucial for the enzyme's catalytic activity and is named for the presence of three conserved Asp residues and one His residue (Maruyama2018Loss). This domain is essential for phospholipase activity, phosphoinositide binding, and oligomerization (Rajasekharan2016DDHD).

The secondary structure of DDHD2 likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, although specific details are not provided in the context. The SAM domain contains a positively charged cluster (Arg434-Lys435-Lys436) that is important for phosphoinositide binding and membrane localization (Gonzalez2013Mutations). The tertiary and quaternary structures are not detailed in the provided context.

Post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms are not specifically mentioned in the context, leaving these aspects of the protein's structure less defined. The DDHD2 protein's role in lipid metabolism and intracellular membrane trafficking is supported by its structural features and domain composition (Rajasekharan2016DDHD).

## Function
The DDHD2 gene encodes a phospholipase enzyme that plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism and intracellular membrane trafficking. In healthy human cells, DDHD2 is involved in the hydrolysis of phospholipids, specifically at the sn-1 position, producing 2-acyl-lysophospholipids and fatty acids. This activity is essential for maintaining the integrity of cellular membranes and facilitating membrane dynamics and vesicle trafficking (Citterio2013Mutations; Gonzalez2013Mutations).

DDHD2 is ubiquitously expressed and localizes to both the cytosol and membrane-associated compartments, including the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It is particularly important for the regulation of intracellular membrane trafficking at the Golgi/ER interface (Maruyama2018Loss; Gonzalez2013Mutations). The protein's activity is facilitated by its lipase activity and the presence of a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, which aids in membrane binding (Maruyama2018Loss).

DDHD2 also plays a protective role against oxidative stress by regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and preventing apoptosis. It is involved in maintaining mitochondrial integrity, as its absence leads to increased ROS production and mitochondrial dysfunction (Maruyama2018Loss). The enzyme's activity in lipid metabolism, particularly in the brain, is crucial for preventing the accumulation of lipid droplets and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Maruyama2018Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DDHD2 gene are associated with autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia type 54 (SPG54), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive spasticity and weakness of the lower limbs. This condition often presents with additional symptoms such as intellectual disability, short stature, and dysgenesis of the corpus callosum (Xu2022Case; Gonzalez2013Mutations). The loss of DDHD2 function leads to the degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord, contributing to the clinical manifestations of SPG54 (Maruyama2018Loss).

DDHD2 mutations result in increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and apoptosis, particularly affecting motor neurons. This is linked to impaired mitochondrial function and decreased cardiolipin content, which are crucial for maintaining mitochondrial integrity (Maruyama2018Loss). The accumulation of lipid droplets in the brain is also observed in both SPG54 patients and DDHD2 knockout mice, suggesting a disruption in lipid metabolism (Maruyama2018Loss).

In addition to SPG54, DDHD2 has been implicated as a candidate risk gene for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Alterations in DDHD2 expression, particularly downregulation, have been associated with ASD, indicating its potential role in neurodevelopmental disorders (Matoba2020Common).

## Interactions
The DDHD2 protein interacts with Syntaxin-binding protein 1 (STXBP1), also known as Munc18-1, which is crucial for presynaptic neurotransmitter release. This interaction is significant for the priming of secretory and synaptic vesicles. The interaction between DDHD2 and STXBP1 was identified through coimmunoprecipitation pull-down assays and high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (HRMS) analysis, and further validated using a targeted multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (MRM-MS) assay (Akefe2023DDHD2). The interaction increases significantly in response to high potassium depolarization, indicating an activity-dependent binding (Akefe2023DDHD2).

DDHD2 is transported to the plasma membrane by STXBP1, facilitating the generation of saturated free fatty acids (FFAs) during neuroexocytosis, which is essential for memory formation (Akefe2023DDHD2). The interaction is independent of STXBP1's function in vesicular priming, as certain STXBP1 mutants can still rescue FFA levels (Akefe2023DDHD2). The ALPHAScreen assay confirmed the direct interaction between DDHD2 and STXBP1, as well as interactions with other proteins such as PAPLA1, PNPLA1, and LYPLA1 isoforms, although to a lesser extent (Akefe2023DDHD2). These interactions suggest that DDHD2 plays a role in lipid metabolism and synaptic plasticity, impacting memory and cognitive functions (Akefe2023DDHD2).
