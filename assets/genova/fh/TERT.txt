# TERT

## Overview
The TERT gene encodes the telomerase reverse transcriptase, a catalytic subunit of the telomerase enzyme, which is essential for maintaining telomere length and ensuring chromosomal stability in eukaryotic cells. Telomerase reverse transcriptase is a specialized enzyme that functions as a reverse transcriptase, synthesizing telomeric DNA repeats using an RNA template. This activity is crucial for the proliferation of cells with high turnover rates, such as stem cells and germ cells, while being repressed in most somatic cells to prevent uncontrolled cell division. Beyond its canonical role in telomere elongation, TERT is involved in non-canonical functions, including mitochondrial protection and regulation of oxidative stress, which are significant in non-dividing tissues. Mutations in the TERT gene, particularly in its promoter region, have been linked to various cancers and telomere-related disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in oncology and genetic diseases (Autexier2006The; Heidenreich2017TERT; Rosen2020Noncanonical).

## Structure
The TERT protein, a key component of the telomerase enzyme, is composed of several domains that contribute to its function. These include the N-terminal domain (TEN), the telomerase RNA-binding domain (TRBD), the reverse transcriptase (RT) domain, and the C-terminal extension (CTE) (Wang2019Structural; Nguyen2018Cryo-EM). The RT domain is responsible for the catalytic activity and is divided into palm and fingers subdomains, with a notable insertion known as the insertion in fingers domain (IFD) (Autexier2006The). The CTE, also referred to as the thumb domain, plays a role in stabilizing the RNA/DNA duplex (Zhai2021Crystal).

The tertiary structure of TERT involves a ring formation by the TRBD, RT, and CTE domains, which encircle the RNA-DNA complex at the active site (Nguyen2018Cryo-EM). This structure is crucial for the enzyme's function in synthesizing telomeric repeats. The quaternary structure of telomerase includes TERT, telomerase RNA (hTR), and additional proteins forming a ribonucleoprotein complex (Wang2019Structural).

TERT undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in various isoforms that can affect its catalytic activity and localization (Subasri2021Analysis). Common post-translational modifications of TERT include phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which may regulate its activity and stability (Autexier2006The).

## Function
Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) is a catalytic subunit of the telomerase enzyme, which plays a crucial role in maintaining telomere length in eukaryotic cells. Telomeres are protective structures at the ends of chromosomes that prevent genomic degradation and fusion. TERT, in conjunction with telomerase RNA, forms a ribonucleoprotein complex that extends the G-rich strand of telomere terminal repeats through reverse transcription of a short RNA template segment. This process is essential for chromosome stability and proper cell division (Autexier2006The; Wyatt2009Human).

In healthy human cells, telomerase activity is typically repressed in most somatic tissues but remains active in highly proliferative tissues such as stem cells, germ cells, and certain hematopoietic tissues. This regulation is vital for sustaining cell proliferation and preventing telomere attrition, which can lead to cell death or senescence (Autexier2006The). TERT also exhibits non-canonical functions, such as protecting mitochondrial DNA and maintaining cellular redox homeostasis by regulating reactive oxygen species levels. This activity is significant in tissues with low replicative potential, like the heart and brain, where TERT helps protect against apoptosis and oxidative stress (Rosen2020Noncanonical).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TERT gene, particularly in its promoter region, are implicated in various cancers and telomere-related disorders. TERT promoter mutations are prevalent in aggressive forms of melanoma, glioma, thyroid carcinoma, and bladder cancer, often correlating with poor prognosis and advanced disease stages (Leão2018Mechanisms; Heidenreich2017TERT). In melanoma, these mutations are frequently found alongside BRAF/NRAS mutations, contributing to tumor progression (Horn2013TERT; Huang2013Highly). In gliomas, TERT promoter mutations are common in primary glioblastomas and are associated with higher disease grades, especially when combined with IDH1 mutations (Leão2018Mechanisms; Heidenreich2017TERT).

In thyroid cancer, TERT mutations, often co-occurring with BRAF mutations, define aggressive subtypes with high recurrence and mortality (Melo2014TERT). In bladder cancer, these mutations are linked to poor survival and recurrence (Heidenreich2017TERT). TERT mutations also play a role in telomere-related disorders such as dyskeratosis congenita and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, where they lead to critically short telomeres and associated clinical manifestations (Heidenreich2017TERT; Zheng2018A). These mutations can result in premature aging and organ failure due to telomere dysfunction.

## Interactions
The TERT protein, a catalytic subunit of telomerase, interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids to perform its function in telomere maintenance and other cellular processes. TERT forms a complex with the telomerase RNA component (hTR), which is crucial for telomerase activity. The telomerase RNA-binding domain (TRBD) of TERT associates with the CR4/5 region of hTR, while the reverse transcriptase domain interacts with the pseudoknot region of hTR (Schmidt2015Human).

TERT also interacts with proteins such as dyskerin, NOP10, and NHP2, which are involved in telomerase assembly and stability (Pinto2011Telomere). The interaction with the POT1-TPP1 complex enhances telomerase processivity, with TPP1 playing a role in telomerase recruitment to telomeres (Zaug2010Functional; Martínez2011Telomeric).

TERT's interactions extend beyond telomere maintenance. It acts as a transcriptional modulator in the Wnt-β-catenin signaling pathway by forming a complex with BRG1, influencing gene expression related to cancer biology (Martínez2011Telomeric). TERT also interacts with the RNA component RMRP, forming a complex with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity, which is involved in siRNA generation (Martínez2011Telomeric). These interactions highlight TERT's multifaceted roles in cellular processes.
