# OAS1

## Overview
The OAS1 gene encodes the protein 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1, which is a key player in the human innate immune response. This protein belongs to the nucleotidyl transferase superfamily and is primarily involved in antiviral defense mechanisms. Upon activation by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a common indicator of viral infection, OAS1 catalyzes the synthesis of 2'-5'-linked oligoadenylates. These oligoadenylates activate RNase L, an enzyme that degrades viral and cellular RNA, thereby inhibiting viral replication and spread (Schwartz2020Human; Hovanessian2007The). OAS1 is predominantly active in the cytoplasm and is induced by interferons, which are proteins released in response to pathogens. Beyond its antiviral role, OAS1 is involved in regulating various cellular processes, including protein synthesis, gene induction, cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Hovanessian2007The).

## Structure
The OAS1 protein is a member of the nucleotidyl transferase superfamily and features a bilobal structure. Its primary structure is encoded by the OAS1 gene, and the protein includes a polymerase beta (pol-β) nucleotidyl transferase domain (Koul2020Structural). The secondary structure consists of a twisted five-stranded antiparallel β sheet flanked by α helices, forming one lobe, while the C-terminal domain forms the second lobe with a four-helix bundle and a three-stranded mixed β sheet (Hartmann2003Crystal). 

The tertiary structure of OAS1 is compact and globular, stabilized by the N-terminal and linker regions, with a hook-like N-terminal extension anchoring to the C-terminal domain (Hartmann2003Crystal). The active site of OAS1 is characterized by a conserved triad of acidic residues (Asp74, Asp76, and Asp147) that coordinate catalytic divalent metal ions, crucial for its enzymatic activity (Hartmann2003Crystal).

OAS1 can form homodimers, representing its quaternary structure, and this dimerization does not obstruct the RNA binding site (Koul2020Structural). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and has splice variant isoforms that contribute to its functional diversity (Koul2020Structural).

## Function
The OAS1 gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the innate immune response in humans. This protein is part of the 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) family, which is activated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a common marker of viral infections. Upon activation, OAS1 catalyzes the synthesis of 2'-5'-linked oligoadenylates, which subsequently activate RNase L, an endoribonuclease that degrades both viral and cellular RNA. This degradation process inhibits viral replication and spread, playing a significant role in antiviral defense (Schwartz2020Human; Hovanessian2007The).

OAS1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is induced by interferons, which are signaling proteins released in response to the presence of pathogens. The activation of OAS1 is highly dependent on specific RNA sequences and structural motifs within the dsRNA, with certain consensus sequences being critical for optimal interaction and activation (Hornung2014OAS; Schwartz2020Human). The protein's activity is not only limited to antiviral responses but also involves regulating protein synthesis, gene induction, cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (Hovanessian2007The). OAS1's role in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to viral threats.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the OAS1 gene have been linked to various diseases and conditions. In the context of COVID-19, a Neanderthal-derived isoform of OAS1, particularly the p46 isoform, is associated with reduced susceptibility and severity of the disease in individuals of European ancestry. This protective effect is linked to the rs10774671-G allele, which enhances the production of the p46 isoform with higher antiviral activity (Zhou2021A; Banday2022Genetic). Conversely, certain haplotypes, including the rs10774671-A allele, are associated with increased risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes (Banday2022Genetic).

OAS1 is also implicated in autoimmune disorders such as Sjögren’s syndrome (SS). The SNP rs10774671 within the OAS1 gene is associated with SS susceptibility, influencing isoform expression and contributing to the disease's risk (Li2017Identification).

In cancer, OAS1 expression is linked to immune response and tumor prognosis. It acts as a potential prognostic biomarker in various cancers, with its expression levels correlating with immune checkpoint genes and tumor mutational burden (Jiang2023Pancancer). These findings highlight the clinical significance of OAS1 in both infectious and non-infectious diseases.

## Interactions
OAS1 interacts with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) as part of its role in the innate immune response. Upon binding to dsRNA, OAS1 undergoes conformational changes that are crucial for its activation. These changes include the formation of a new helix and the rearrangement of key residues at the protein/RNA interface, leading to the formation of an RNA-induced catalytic structure (RICS) that coordinates Mg2+ ions for ATP binding and catalysis (Donovan2013Structural).

OAS1 is also activated by specific RNA structures, such as the noncoding RNA nc886. This RNA can adopt two conformers, with Conformer 1 strongly activating OAS1, while Conformer 2 has a much weaker effect. The structural motifs in nc886, particularly in the apical stem-loop, are critical for this activation (Calderon2018A).

In addition to RNA interactions, OAS1 is involved in protein-protein interactions. It is part of a network with proteins such as RNASEL, RSAD2, and MX1, which are involved in antiviral responses. These interactions are significant for processes like the negative regulation of viral genome replication (jain20222; Wang2024Prognostic). OAS1 also interacts with viral proteins, such as the African swine fever virus protein p30, which may help the virus evade the host's immune response (Chen2022Interaction).
