"summary": "The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the arginine N-methyltransferase family, which catalyze the sequential transfer of methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to the side chain nitrogens of arginine residues within proteins, to form methylated arginine derivatives and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine. This protein can catalyze both, the formation of omega-N monomethylarginine and asymmetrical dimethylarginine, with a strong preference for the latter. It specifically mediates the asymmetric dimethylation of Arg2 of histone H3, and the methylated form represents a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional repression. This protein also forms a complex with, and methylates DNA polymerase beta, resulting in stimulation of polymerase activity by enhancing DNA binding and processivity.
