# SH3BP5L

## Overview
The SH3BP5L gene encodes the SH3 binding domain protein 5 like, which is a member of the SH3 domain-containing protein family. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction pathways, by interacting with other proteins through its SH3 domain. The SH3BP5L protein is known to play a role in the regulation of cellular dynamics and has been implicated in the modulation of specific signaling pathways, such as the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway (Qiu2020aarFDC). Understanding the function and interactions of SH3BP5L is crucial for elucidating its role in cellular physiology and its potential implications in disease states.
