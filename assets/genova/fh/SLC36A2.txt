# SLC36A2

## Overview
The SLC36A2 gene encodes the solute carrier family 36 member 2 protein, commonly referred to as PAT2, which is a proton-coupled amino acid transporter. This protein is a member of the Amino Acid/Auxin Permease (AAAP) family and is characterized by its 11-transmembrane-domain topology, which facilitates its role in the transport of small, unbranched, dipolar amino and imino acids, such as glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline, primarily in the renal proximal tubule (Boll2003A; Thwaites2011The). PAT2 operates optimally at alkaline pH levels and is sensitive to changes in membrane voltage, functioning bidirectionally based on substrate concentration gradients and membrane potential (Thwaites2011The). Beyond its renal expression, PAT2 is also found in tissues such as skeletal muscle, heart, and brain, indicating potential roles in these areas (Thwaites2011The). Mutations in SLC36A2 are linked to disorders like iminoglycinuria and hyperglycinuria, underscoring the gene's significance in amino acid homeostasis (Bröer2008Iminoglycinuria; Thwaites2011The).

## Structure
The SLC36A2 gene encodes the PAT2 protein, a proton-coupled amino acid transporter. PAT2 is characterized by an 11-transmembrane-domain (TMD) topology, with the N-terminus located internally and the C-terminus potentially facing the extracellular side or the intralysosomal compartment (Boll2003A). The protein is part of the Amino Acid/Auxin Permease (AAAP) family and exhibits a LeuT-fold structure, which is a common motif in the APC superfamily of transporters. This structure consists of a core of ten transmembrane spans organized into a 5 + 5 inverted structural repeat, forming a central binding pocket that determines substrate specificity (Edwards2017Resculpting).

The PAT2 protein is involved in the reabsorption of amino acids such as glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline in the renal proximal tubule (Thwaites2011The). It is known for its narrow substrate selectivity, which is influenced by the size of the side chains of the amino acids it transports (Kennedy2005Substrate). The protein's structure is adapted to recognize specific spatial arrangements of amino and carboxyl groups in substrates, contributing to its selectivity (Kennedy2005Substrate).

## Function
The SLC36A2 gene encodes the PAT2 protein, a proton-coupled amino acid transporter primarily involved in the reabsorption of small, unbranched, dipolar amino and imino acids in the kidney. PAT2 is expressed at the apical surface of the renal proximal tubule, where it plays a crucial role in the reabsorption of amino acids such as glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline from the renal filtrate (Thwaites2011The). This transporter operates optimally at extracellular pH values between 7.4 and 9.3 and is sensitive to changes in membrane voltage, functioning bidirectionally depending on the substrate concentration gradient, pH gradient, and membrane potential (Thwaites2011The).

In addition to its role in the kidney, PAT2 is expressed in other tissues, including skeletal muscle, heart, and brain, suggesting additional roles in these tissues, although these are less well characterized (Thwaites2011The). The protein's function is influenced by its glycosylation state, which affects its transport activity and localization (Thwaites2011The). Mutations in SLC36A2 can lead to conditions such as iminoglycinuria and hyperglycinuria, characterized by excess urinary excretion of certain amino acids, highlighting its importance in maintaining amino acid balance in the body (Bröer2008Iminoglycinuria; Thwaites2011The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC36A2 gene are associated with iminoglycinuria (IG) and hyperglycinuria (HG), which are disorders affecting amino acid transport in the kidneys. Iminoglycinuria is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by excessive urinary excretion of proline, hydroxyproline, and glycine. It is primarily caused by mutations in SLC36A2, which encodes the proton-dependent amino acid transporter PAT2. These mutations can lead to inactive or reduced function of the transporter, significantly impacting amino acid reabsorption in the renal proximal tubule (Bröer2008Iminoglycinuria; Yahyaoui2019Amino).

Specific mutations, such as the G87V substitution and the IVS1+1G→A splice donor site mutation, have been identified in SLC36A2. The G87V mutation partially inactivates the transporter, while the IVS1+1G→A mutation affects normal splicing, resulting in a truncated protein (Bröer2008Iminoglycinuria). These genetic alterations contribute to the phenotypic expression of IG and HG, with IG often observed when SLC36A2 mutations are combined with mutations in other transporters like SLC6A20 (Bröer2008Iminoglycinuria).

While IG and HG are generally considered benign, they have been associated with conditions such as hypertension, nephrolithiasis, and atypical gyrate atrophy, although these associations may be due to ascertainment bias (Yahyaoui2019Amino).
