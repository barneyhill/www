# BAZ2A

## Overview
BAZ2A is a gene that encodes the protein bromodomain adjacent to zinc finger domain 2A, which is a key player in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. This protein is categorized as an epigenetic reader due to its ability to recognize acetylated lysine residues on histone tails through its bromodomain, facilitating the regulation of gene expression. BAZ2A is a component of the nucleolar remodeling complex (NoRC), where it contributes to the silencing of ribosomal RNA genes and the maintenance of chromatin structure. The protein's involvement in chromatin dynamics is crucial for cellular processes such as ribosome biogenesis and gene repression. BAZ2A's expression and interactions have significant implications in various cancers, where it often serves as a marker for poor prognosis and a potential therapeutic target (Roganowicz2021BAZ2ARNA; PeñaHernández2020BAZ2A; Chen2015Discovery).

## Structure
The BAZ2A protein is a large multidomain protein with a sequence length ranging from 1527 to 1972 amino acids. It features a carboxy-terminal bromodomain, which is a conserved structural domain involved in recognizing acetylated lysine residues on histones, facilitating chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation (Jones2000A; Dalle2021Identification). Adjacent to the bromodomain is a PHD finger, a C4HC3 zinc finger motif, which is involved in chromatin interactions and histone code recognition (Jones2000A).

The protein also contains several conserved motifs, including the WAKZ motif adjacent to the PHD finger and the ZB2 motif, which are shared with other BAZ proteins and suggest a structural and functional relationship among these proteins (Jones2000A). The BAZ2A protein is part of the nucleolar remodeling complex (NoRC), where it plays a role in controlling rDNA accessibility and transcription (Dalle2021Identification).

BAZ2A is expressed in various tissues, with evidence of smaller splice variants indicating potential isoforms (Jones2000A). The protein's structure and motifs suggest it may interact with ligand-bound nuclear receptors, similar to other transcription factors with bromodomains (Jones2000A).

## Function
BAZ2A, also known as bromodomain adjacent to zinc finger domain 2A, is a protein that plays a significant role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation in healthy human cells. It is a component of the nucleolar remodeling complex (NoRC), which is part of the ISWI family of chromatin remodeling complexes. These complexes are crucial for regulating the expression of noncoding RNAs and the formation of repressive heterochromatin, particularly at centromeres and telomeres (Chen2015Discovery).

BAZ2A functions as an epigenetic reader, recognizing acetylated lysine sequences on histone tails through its bromodomain. This interaction is a post-translational modification that is highly abundant in histones and other nuclear proteins, contributing to the regulation of gene transcription (Chen2015Discovery). In particular, BAZ2A binds to chromatin regions marked by the histone modification H3K14ac, which is associated with inactive enhancers. This binding is mediated by the BAZ2A bromodomain, which specifically recognizes H3K14ac, playing a role in gene repression (PeñaHernández2020BAZ2A).

In the nucleolus, BAZ2A is involved in the silencing of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes transcribed by RNA Polymerase I. This process is crucial for maintaining proper ribosome biogenesis and cellular homeostasis (Roganowicz2021BAZ2ARNA).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the BAZ2A gene have been linked to various cancers, where it often serves as a marker for poor prognosis. In liver cancer (LIHC), BAZ2A is highly expressed and associated with poor patient outcomes, immune invasion, and cancer progression. Downregulation of BAZ2A in hepatoma cell lines has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while promoting apoptosis, indicating its role in tumor progression (Liu2024Pancancer). In prostate cancer (PCa), BAZ2A is highly expressed in metastatic cases and is associated with poor outcomes. It interacts with proteins such as TOP2A and KDM1A to repress genes implicated in cancer progression, suggesting its involvement in gene regulation beyond rRNA transcription (Roganowicz2021BAZ2ARNA).

In cervical cancer (CC), BAZ2A expression is upregulated through the LINC00885/miR-3150b-3p axis, promoting cancer progression by enhancing cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis. This pathway highlights BAZ2A's role in CC and suggests potential therapeutic targets (Liu2022LINC00885). Overall, BAZ2A's expression and interactions are critical in the progression of several cancers, making it a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker.

## Interactions
BAZ2A, also known as bromodomain adjacent to zinc finger domain protein 2A, is involved in various protein and nucleic acid interactions, particularly in the context of prostate cancer cells. It interacts with topoisomerase 2A (TOP2A) and histone demethylase KDM1A (LSD1) through its TAM domain in an RNA-dependent manner. This interaction is crucial for its function in chromatin association and gene regulation, as treatment with RNase A significantly reduces these associations (Roganowicz2021BAZ2ARNA).

BAZ2A also associates with components of the cohesin protein complex, such as SMC1A and RAD21, and proteins involved in RNA processing and nuclear pore complex formation, like NUP107 (Roganowicz2021BAZ2ARNA). Its bromodomain (BRD) specifically recognizes acetylated lysine residues on histones, such as H3K14ac, facilitating its role as an epigenetic reader. This interaction is essential for the transition of prostate cancer cells into a cancer stem-like state (PeñaHernández2020BAZ2A).

In addition, BAZ2A is part of the nucleolar remodeling complex (NoRC), where it interacts with acetylated histone tails, playing a role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation (Chen2015Discovery). These interactions highlight BAZ2A's significant role in gene repression and chromatin dynamics.
