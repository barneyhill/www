# TSPAN31

## Overview
TSPAN31 is a gene that encodes the protein tetraspanin 31, a member of the tetraspanin family, which is characterized by four transmembrane domains. Tetraspanin 31 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation, through its interactions with other proteins and signaling pathways (Xia2020TSPAN31; Chen2024Tetraspanins). The protein's structure includes two hydrophilic extracellular domains and a small intracellular loop, which are crucial for its function and stability (Reppert2022A). Tetraspanin 31 has been implicated in the progression of several cancers, such as gastric cancer and glioblastoma, where it influences cell proliferation and metastasis through pathways like PI3K/AKT (Zhang2024Tspan; Li2023Tetraspanins). Its role in cancer biology makes TSPAN31 a potential target for therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating its activity to improve clinical outcomes (Zhou2023The).

## Structure
TSPAN31, a member of the tetraspanin family, is characterized by four transmembrane domains, two hydrophilic extracellular domains, and a small intracellular loop. These structural features are typical of tetraspanins, which are involved in various cellular processes such as adhesion, migration, and proliferation (Xia2020TSPAN31). The small intracellular loop (SIL) of tetraspanins, including TSPAN31, is noted for its conserved sequence, which forms an M-shaped inter-helix turn. This motif is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the protein and is characterized by specific dihedral angles and interactions between residues like glutamate and lysine (Reppert2022A).

The tertiary structure of tetraspanins is often described by two models: a tight four transmembrane helix bundle and a funnel-shaped arrangement. The SIL plays a significant role in these structures, contributing to the protein's stability and interactions with other proteins (Reppert2022A). Although specific details about the quaternary structure of TSPAN31 are not provided, tetraspanins generally form complexes with other proteins, influencing cell signaling pathways (Reppert2022A). The presence of conserved cysteine residues in the larger extracellular loop suggests potential sites for disulfide bond formation, which may further stabilize the protein's structure.

## Clinical Significance
TSPAN31 has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in cell proliferation, migration, and survival. In glioblastoma (GBM), TSPAN31 is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis, influencing the tumor immune microenvironment and potentially affecting immunotherapy outcomes (Li2023Tetraspanins). Genetic mutations in TSPAN31, including missense and truncating mutations, have a mutation frequency of 19% in GBM patients, suggesting a significant role in GBM progression (Li2023Tetraspanins).

In gastric cancer, TSPAN31 is highly expressed and correlates with poor prognosis. It promotes cancer cell proliferation and migration through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and is linked to therapy resistance by enhancing drug resistance mechanisms (Zhou2023The). Silencing TSPAN31 in gastric cancer cells increases chemosensitivity to cisplatin, indicating its role in reducing chemotherapy effectiveness (Zhou2023The).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, TSPAN31 facilitates cell migration and invasion but has less impact on proliferation. It regulates CDK4 expression, affecting cell cycle progression and signaling pathways related to cell survival and metastasis (Zhou2023The; Chen2024Tetraspanins). These findings highlight TSPAN31 as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in various cancers.

## Interactions
TSPAN31, a member of the tetraspanin family, is involved in various interactions that influence cancer cell behavior. It interacts with the METTL1/CCT2 and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, facilitating the proliferation and metastasis of gastric cancer cells (Zhang2024Tspan). TSPAN31 also plays a role in regulating cell growth by interacting with CDK4 mRNA, serving as a natural antisense transcript to inhibit CDK4 protein expression in human cervical cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. This interaction targets the 3ʹ-untranslated region of the CDK4 mRNA, suppressing cell proliferation (Zhou2023The).

In gastric cancer, TSPAN31 promotes cell proliferation and migration while suppressing apoptosis through co-expression with methyltransferase like 1 and recombinant chaperonin containing TCP1, subunit 2 (Chen2024Tetraspanins). Silencing TSPAN31 expression reduces the levels of p-Akt, p-GSK3β, and β-catenin, proteins involved in the Akt signaling pathway, and blocks the translocation of β-catenin to the nucleus, thereby preventing the spread and movement of hepatocellular carcinoma cells (Chen2024Tetraspanins). These interactions highlight TSPAN31's role in modulating key signaling pathways and its potential as a target for therapeutic strategies in cancer treatment.
