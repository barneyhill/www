# SMIM36

## Overview
SMIM36 is a gene that encodes the small integral membrane protein 36, a member of the SMall Integral Membrane proteins (SMIMs) family. This protein is characterized by its transmembrane domain, which suggests its involvement in cellular interactions within the retina (Sharma2023SMIM36). SMIM36 is highly conserved across species and plays a crucial role in retinal lamination, particularly in the development and function of the neural retina in both humans and zebrafish (Sharma2023SMIM36). The gene is located in a genomic region associated with High Myopia, indicating its potential clinical significance in eye health (Mudge2019Discovery; Sharma2023SMIM36).

## Function
SMIM36 is a conserved microprotein involved in retinal lamination, particularly in the human and zebrafish retinas. It is expressed in bipolar cells, rods, and Muller glia, indicating its role in the development and function of the neural retina (Sharma2023SMIM36). The protein is part of the SMall Integral Membrane proteins (SMIMs) family, characterized by a transmembrane domain, suggesting its involvement in local interactions between cells (Sharma2023SMIM36).

In zebrafish, the knockdown of SMIM36 results in microphthalmia and defects in retinal layers, highlighting its importance in retinal development (Sharma2023SMIM36). The protein is co-expressed with transcription factors such as SIX homeobox 3b (six3b), Basic HLH (bhlhe23), and Visual System Homeobox1 (vsx1), which are known regulators of retinal gene expression and are linked to human diseases (Sharma2023SMIM36).

In humans, SMIM36 is located in a genomic region associated with High Myopia, a condition characterized by extreme nearsightedness and a predisposition to retinal detachment (Sharma2023SMIM36). The protein's expression in the retina aligns with its eye-specific transcription profile, suggesting a significant role in retinal health (Mudge2019Discovery).
