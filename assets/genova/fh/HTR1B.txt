# HTR1B

## Overview
The HTR1B gene encodes the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1B (5-HT1B), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a pivotal role in the serotonergic system. This receptor is primarily involved in modulating neurotransmitter release, particularly serotonin, and is implicated in various physiological processes such as mood regulation, sleep, and pain perception (Xia2020Functional; Sanders2002DNA). The 5-HT1B receptor is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains, typical of Class A GPCRs, and is predominantly expressed in presynaptic neurons, where it functions as both an autoreceptor and a heteroreceptor (Barnes1999A; McCorvy2015Structure). Its activity is linked to behavioral and physiological outcomes, including locomotion and thermoregulation, and it is a target for therapeutic agents used in treating migraines (Sanders2002DNA). The gene's polymorphisms have been associated with various psychiatric disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in mental health (Duan2003Polymorphisms; Lappalainen1998Linkage).

## Structure
The HTR1B gene encodes the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1B, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in serotonin signaling. This receptor is characterized by a canonical structure of seven transmembrane (TM) α-helical domains, typical of Class A GPCRs, and includes an intramembrane helix 8 (H8) (McCorvy2015Structure). The receptor's structure is further defined by three intracellular loops (IL) and three extracellular loops (EL), which contribute to its functional architecture (McCorvy2015Structure).

The 5-HT1B receptor's ligand binding pocket is composed of a lower orthosteric pocket and an upper extended binding pocket, which are crucial for ligand binding affinity and selectivity, respectively (Yin2018Crystal). Key residues involved in ligand binding include D129, Y359, W327, F330, and F331, which form a hydrophobic pocket essential for effective ligand interaction (Yin2018Crystal).

The receptor can form homodimers or heterodimers, contributing to its quaternary structure. It is primarily expressed in presynaptic neurons, where it plays a role in reducing serotonin release upon binding (Yin2018Crystal). The receptor is also involved in the inhibition of norepinephrine release from post-ganglionic sympathetic nerve terminals (Hamblin1992Molecular).

## Function
The HTR1B gene encodes the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1B (5-HT1B), a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a crucial role in the serotonin system. This receptor is involved in modulating neurotransmitter release, particularly serotonin, and is implicated in various physiological processes such as mood regulation, sleep, pain, feeding, and temperature control (Xia2020Functional; Sanders2002DNA). The 5-HT1B receptor functions as both an autoreceptor and a heteroreceptor, influencing the release of neurotransmitters like acetylcholine and dopamine in different brain regions (Barnes1999A).

In healthy human cells, the 5-HT1B receptor is primarily located on axon terminals and is involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release, acting as an autoreceptor for serotonin and a heteroreceptor for other neurotransmitters (Barnes1999A). It is predominantly expressed in the caudate-putamen and cortex, with additional presence in the hippocampus, cerebellum, and cerebral arteries (Sanders2001Genetic). The receptor's activity is linked to various behavioral and physiological outcomes, including locomotion, feeding, and thermoregulation, and it is thought to mediate the therapeutic effects of triptans for migraine headaches (Sanders2002DNA).

## Clinical Significance
The HTR1B gene, encoding the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1B, is implicated in various psychiatric and behavioral disorders due to its role in serotonergic neurotransmission. Alterations in HTR1B expression or function have been associated with conditions such as schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, and substance abuse. Polymorphisms in the HTR1B gene, particularly in the 5′-untranslated region, affect gene expression and have been linked to psychiatric disorders like antisocial alcoholism, suicide attempts, bulimia nervosa, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (Duan2003Polymorphisms; Lappalainen1998Linkage).

The rs13212041 polymorphism in the HTR1B gene is associated with self-reported anger and hostility, with the A-allele predisposing individuals to more hostile emotional states (Conner2009Functional). This polymorphism also plays a role in alcohol dependence, particularly influencing the onset of alcohol abuse (Svob2019&lt; p&gt; The).

In the context of depression treatment, variations in HTR1B can affect the response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Certain haplotypes associated with higher expression levels of HTR1B have been linked to slower response rates to SSRIs like citalopram, suggesting that down-regulation of HTR1B is necessary for effective treatment (Villafuerte2009SSRI).
