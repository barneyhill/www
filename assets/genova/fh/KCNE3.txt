# KCNE3

## Overview
The KCNE3 gene encodes the protein potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily E regulatory subunit 3, also known as MiRP2, which is a single-pass transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in modulating the function of voltage-gated potassium channels. This protein is particularly significant in its interaction with the KCNQ1 channel, where it transforms the channel's activity from voltage-dependent to voltage-independent, effectively creating a potassium leak channel. This transformation is crucial for maintaining ion homeostasis and facilitating the transport of water and salts across epithelial cell layers, especially in the colon. KCNE3's regulatory function is achieved through specific electrostatic interactions with the voltage sensor of KCNQ1, highlighting its importance in cellular electrical activity and overall physiological processes (BarroSoria2015KCNE3; Abbott2016KCNE1). Additionally, mutations in KCNE3 have been linked to various cardiac conditions, including Brugada Syndrome, Long QT Syndrome, and atrial fibrillation, underscoring its clinical significance (Delpón2008Functional; Ohno2009NovelKCNE3mutation).

## Structure
The KCNE3 protein, also known as MiRP2, is a single-pass integral membrane protein that modulates the function of voltage-gated potassium channels, such as KCNQ1. Its primary structure consists of a short polypeptide chain, with a transmembrane domain (TMD) spanning residues 57 to 82 (Moura2024Studying; Asare2022Investigating). The secondary structure of KCNE3 includes an alpha-helical transmembrane domain, which is crucial for its interaction with KCNQ1 during channel gating (Moura2024Studying). This domain is described as a moderately curved α-helical structure, with specific residues such as T71, S74, and G78 along the concave face (Moura2024Studying). 

The tertiary structure of KCNE3 involves the TMD adopting a nearly linear α-helical conformation in lipid bilayers, which remains stable even in the presence of interaction-impairing mutations (Moura2024Studying). The quaternary structure is characterized by the KCNE3 TMD stabilizing the voltage-sensing domain of KCNQ1 in its open configuration, indicating its role in the KCNE3/KCNQ1 complex (Moura2024Studying). KCNE3 is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which can influence its function and interactions.

## Function
The KCNE3 gene encodes a regulatory subunit that modulates the activity of voltage-gated potassium channels, particularly KCNQ1. In healthy human cells, KCNE3 plays a crucial role in transforming KCNQ1 channels from voltage-dependent to voltage-independent, effectively converting them into potassium leak channels. This transformation is achieved by promoting the activation of the voltage sensor in the KCNQ1 channel, specifically affecting the S4 segment, which results in the channel being constitutively open within the physiological voltage range (BarroSoria2015KCNE3; Abbott2016KCNE1).

KCNE3 is primarily active in epithelial cells, where it is essential for maintaining ion homeostasis and facilitating the transport of water and salts across cell layers. This function is particularly important in the colon, where KCNE3-KCNQ1 channels support water and salt secretion, contributing to fluid balance and electrolyte regulation (BarroSoria2015KCNE3; Abbott2016KCNE1).

The interaction between KCNE3 and KCNQ1 involves specific electrostatic interactions between negatively charged residues in KCNE3 and positively charged residues in the S4 segment of KCNQ1, which are critical for the modulation of channel properties (BarroSoria2015KCNE3). These molecular processes underscore KCNE3's role in cellular electrical activity and its impact on organismal physiology.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KCNE3 gene have been associated with several cardiac conditions, including Brugada Syndrome (BrS), Long QT Syndrome (LQTS), and atrial fibrillation (AF). The R99H mutation in KCNE3 has been linked to Brugada Syndrome, a condition characterized by abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) findings and an increased risk of sudden cardiac death. This mutation enhances the transient outward current (I to) by interacting with Kv4.3 channels, potentially predisposing individuals to BrS by altering the electrical properties of cardiac cells (Delpón2008Functional).

In Long QT Syndrome, the R99H and T4A mutations in KCNE3 have been identified in patients, leading to a reduction in repolarizing potassium current, which is crucial for cardiac repolarization. This reduction can prolong the QT interval, increasing the risk of arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes (Ohno2009NovelKCNE3mutation).

The V17M mutation in KCNE3 has been associated with early-onset lone atrial fibrillation. This mutation increases the activity of Kv4.3/KCNE3 and Kv11.1/KCNE3 channel complexes, leading to faster cardiac action potential repolarization and potentially promoting re-entrant wavelets in the atria, which can increase susceptibility to AF (Lundby2008KCNE3).

## Interactions
KCNE3, also known as MiRP2, is a regulatory subunit that interacts with various potassium channels, influencing their function and expression. KCNE3 forms complexes with Kv12.2 channels, regulating their membrane surface expression and trafficking to the plasma membrane. Knockdown of KCNE3 increases the surface expression of Kv12.2, indicating its role in channel trafficking. KCNE3 and KCNE1 can simultaneously interact with tetrameric Kv12.2 channels, forming a tripartite complex, although KCNE3 does not directly interact with KCNE1 (Clancy2009KCNE1).

In the brain, KCNE3 interacts with Kv2.1 and Kv3.1 channels, as shown by co-immunoprecipitation studies. In skeletal muscle, KCNE3 co-assembles with Kv3.4 channels, and mutations in KCNE3 can disrupt this interaction, affecting channel function. In the heart, KCNE3 mutations affecting its interaction with Kv4.3 channels are linked to Brugada syndrome, while gain-of-function mutations in KCNQ1-KCNE3 channels are associated with atrial fibrillation (Delpón2008Functional; Abbott2016KCNE1).

KCNE3 also interacts with KCNQ1 channels, keeping them constitutively active. This interaction involves specific residues in the transmembrane domain of KCNE3, which stabilize the channel in the activated state (Abbott2016KCNE1).
