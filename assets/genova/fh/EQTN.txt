# EQTN

## Overview
EQTN is a gene that encodes the protein equatorin, a type 1 membrane protein predominantly expressed in spermatozoa. Equatorin is characterized by its complex glycosylation and sialylation patterns, which are crucial for its function in the acrosomal membrane of sperm cells. This protein plays a significant role in the acrosome reaction, a critical process in fertilization, by maintaining the integrity and stability of the acrosomal membrane. Equatorin's involvement in sperm-egg adhesion and fusion underscores its importance in male fertility. The absence of EQTN, as demonstrated in mouse models, results in impaired sperm-egg adhesion, highlighting its essential role in successful fertilization (Ito2014EquatorinRelated; Ito2018Deletion).

## Structure
Equatorin (EQTN) is a highly glycosylated and sialylated N, O-sialoglycoprotein, characterized by its complex structure and specific localization in spermatozoa. The core protein has a molecular weight of approximately 27 kDa, with a significant O-sialylated carbohydrate region branching from threonine 138, which is crucial for the epitope recognized by the MN9 antibody (Ito2014EquatorinRelated). EQTN is a type 1 membrane protein with a single transmembrane domain, featuring an N-terminus located in the acrosome lumen and a C-terminus in the cytoplasm (Ito2018Deletion).

The protein is insoluble in mild detergents and exhibits long and short forms, with its molecular size varying from approximately 65 kDa in testicular germ cells to 40–50 kDa in cauda epididymal spermatozoa (Ito2014EquatorinRelated). During the acrosome reaction, EQTN relocates to the plasma membrane over the equatorial segment, suggesting a role in stabilizing the acrosomal membrane and maintaining the acrosome's shape (Ito2014EquatorinRelated). The protein's glycosylation status can be analyzed by mobility shift assays using glycosidase treatment, indicating its complex post-translational modifications (Ito2014EquatorinRelated). EQTN is also known by other names, such as Afaf and C9orf11 (Ito2014EquatorinRelated).

## Function
Equatorin (EQTN) is a protein that plays a critical role in the fertilization process, particularly in sperm-egg adhesion and fusion. In healthy human cells, EQTN is localized in the acrosomal membrane of sperm cells, where it is involved in maintaining the integrity of this membrane, which is essential for successful fertilization (Ito2018Deletion). EQTN is a type 1 membrane protein and a sialoglycoprotein with a single transmembrane domain, indicating its involvement in membrane fusion and vesicle trafficking during the acrosome reaction (Ito2018Deletion).

The acrosome reaction is a crucial step in sperm maturation, allowing sperm to penetrate the egg's protective layers. EQTN's role in this process is vital for proper sperm function and male fertility. In the absence of EQTN, as observed in mouse models, there is impaired sperm-egg adhesion, leading to reduced fertility despite normal sperm morphology and motility (Ito2018Deletion). This suggests that EQTN is essential for the proper localization and function of proteins involved in the acrosome reaction, thereby facilitating successful fertilization (Ito2018Deletion).
