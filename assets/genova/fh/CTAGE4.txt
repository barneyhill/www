# CTAGE4

## Overview
CTAGE4 is a gene that encodes the CTAGE family member 4 protein, which is integral to cellular processes involving protein transport and secretion. The CTAGE4 protein is primarily associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, where it plays a critical role in vesicle-mediated transport. This protein is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis by facilitating the proper trafficking of proteins within the cell, ensuring they reach their intended destinations. The CTAGE4 protein's involvement in the secretory pathway is crucial for the correct processing and delivery of proteins, which is vital for various cellular functions and overall organismal health. Its role in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular balance and efficiency, contributing to the stability and functionality of human cells (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Structure


## Function
CTAGE4, a member of the CTAGE family, encodes a protein that plays a significant role in cellular processes such as protein transport and secretion. This protein is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, where it is involved in vesicle-mediated transport. The CTAGE4 protein is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis by ensuring proper protein trafficking within the cell. Its activity in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus highlights its importance in the secretory pathway, facilitating the movement of proteins from their site of synthesis to their final destinations. This function is vital for the proper functioning of cells, as it ensures that proteins are correctly processed and delivered, which is essential for various cellular activities and overall organismal health. The role of CTAGE4 in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining the balance and efficiency of cellular operations, contributing to the stability and functionality of human cells.
