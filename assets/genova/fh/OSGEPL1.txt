# OSGEPL1

## Overview
OSGEPL1 is a gene that encodes the protein O-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase like 1, which plays a critical role in mitochondrial function. This protein is primarily involved in the t6A37 modification of mitochondrial tRNAs, a process essential for accurate aminoacylation and protein synthesis within mitochondria (Lin2018CO2sensitive). As a monomeric enzyme, OSGEPL1 facilitates the transfer of the threonylcarbamoyl moiety to tRNAs, ensuring translational fidelity and efficiency (Zhou2020Molecular). The protein's activity is modulated by acetylation at specific lysine residues, which can either enhance or reduce its function (Zhou2020Molecular). OSGEPL1's role is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial energy metabolism and has implications in various diseases, including cancer and mitochondrial disorders (Su2022Conservation; Weigert20245Hydroxymethylcytosine).

## Function
OSGEPL1 is a crucial protein involved in the t6A37 modification of mitochondrial tRNAs in human cells. This modification is essential for the proper aminoacylation and protein synthesis within mitochondria, impacting mitochondrial function and energy production (Lin2018CO2sensitive). OSGEPL1 predominantly localizes to mitochondria, facilitated by a mitochondrial targeting sequence in its N-terminal region, which is necessary for its function (Lin2018CO2sensitive).

The protein operates as a monomer and is involved in transferring the threonylcarbamoyl moiety to tRNAs, which is critical for translational accuracy and fidelity (Zhou2020Molecular). OSGEPL1's activity is influenced by acetylation, with specific lysine residues playing significant roles in its function. For instance, acetylation at Lys203 reduces its activity, while acetylation at Lys299 increases it (Zhou2020Molecular).

In healthy cells, OSGEPL1 ensures efficient mitochondrial protein synthesis by facilitating the t6A modification, which is crucial for the proper folding and function of mitochondrial tRNAs (Zhou2020Molecular). This modification is vital for maintaining cellular energy metabolism and is linked to the regulation of genes involved in processes like the Warburg effect, significant in cancer cell metabolism (Su2022Conservation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the OSGEPL1 gene have been implicated in several human diseases. In high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), OSGEPL1 expression is downregulated, with levels decreasing as the cancer progresses. This downregulation is associated with poorer survival outcomes, and OSGEPL1 has been identified as a favorable prognostic marker for overall survival in HGSOC patients (Weigert20245Hydroxymethylcytosine). Genetic mutations in OSGEPL1 are also linked to Galloway-Mowat syndrome (GAMOS), a congenital nephrotic syndrome, highlighting its role in mitochondrial function and tRNA modification (Su2022Conservation).

In angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), potentially pathogenic variants of OSGEPL1 have been identified, suggesting a role in cancer susceptibility (Donner2018Candidate). Additionally, mutations affecting the t6A modification process, in which OSGEPL1 is involved, can lead to mitochondrial diseases and other pathologies due to impaired translational accuracy and fidelity (Zhou2020Molecular).

Post-translational modifications, such as acetylation, can significantly impact OSGEPL1 activity. Specific mutations, like OSGEPL1-K203Q, result in reduced activity and protein stability, which may contribute to disease pathogenesis (Zhou2020Molecular). These findings underscore the clinical significance of OSGEPL1 in various diseases, particularly those involving mitochondrial dysfunction.

## Interactions
OSGEPL1 is a monomeric protein involved in the t6A modification of human mitochondrial tRNAs. It does not form homodimers or interact with the protein YrdC, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Zhou2020Molecular). OSGEPL1 possesses intrinsic ATPase activity, which is dependent on the presence of Fe3+, and this activity is crucial for its function in tRNA modification (Zhou2020Molecular). The protein interacts with hmtRNA Thr, showing a specific binding affinity that is quantitatively analyzed through biolayer interferometry (Zhou2020Molecular). 

OSGEPL1's activity is influenced by post-translational modifications, particularly acetylation at specific lysine residues. Acetylation at Lys203 significantly reduces its activity, while acetylation at Lys299 enhances it, suggesting these sites play regulatory roles in its interaction with tRNA (Zhou2020Molecular). The protein can bind tRNA and perform multiple turnovers independently, indicating it does not require co-factors like TsaB or Pcc1, which are necessary in other organisms for tRNA binding and catalysis (Zhou2020Molecular). OSGEPL1's role in t6A modification is crucial for mitochondrial function, as its knockout results in respiratory defects and reduced mitochondrial translation (Zhou2020Molecular).
