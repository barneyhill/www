# ANAPC13

## Overview
ANAPC13 is a gene that encodes the protein anaphase-promoting complex subunit 13, which is a critical component of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). The APC/C is a multi-subunit E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a pivotal role in regulating the cell cycle by marking specific proteins for degradation, thereby ensuring proper progression through mitosis and maintaining genomic stability (Schrock2020APCC; Manchado2010The). ANAPC13 is part of the accessory sub-complex within the APC/C, associated with the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) lobe, which contributes to the structural integrity and scaffolding of the complex (Melloy2019The). The proper function of ANAPC13 is essential for the orderly transition from metaphase to anaphase, and its dysregulation has been linked to chromosomal instability and cancer development, underscoring its importance in cellular homeostasis and potential as a therapeutic target (Schrock2020APCC; Thu2018Disruption).

## Structure


## Function
ANAPC13 is a subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a crucial E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in cell cycle regulation. The APC/C complex is essential for the transition from metaphase to anaphase during mitosis, facilitating proper chromosome segregation by targeting specific proteins for degradation via ubiquitination (Schrock2020APCC; Manchado2010The). ANAPC13 is part of the accessory sub-complex within the APC/C, associated with the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) lobe, which plays a role in scaffolding within the complex (Melloy2019The).

In healthy human cells, ANAPC13 contributes to the regulation of mitotic progression and mitotic exit, ensuring genomic stability and proper cell division (Thu2018Disruption). The APC/C, including ANAPC13, is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it regulates the degradation of cyclins and other cell cycle regulators, thus maintaining orderly cell cycle progression (Schrock2020APCC). Dysregulation of APC/C components, including ANAPC13, can lead to chromosomal instability, which is implicated in cancer development, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Schrock2020APCC).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of ANAPC13, a component of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), have been implicated in the development of resistance to TTK inhibitors in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Studies have shown that disruption of ANAPC13, along with other APC/C components, confers resistance to TTK inhibitors such as CFI-402257. This resistance is characterized by reduced apoptosis, decreased aneuploidy induction, and prolonged mitotic timing in cancer cells (Thu2018Disruption).

The dysfunction of the APC/C complex, including ANAPC13, allows cancer cells to tolerate chromosomal instability, a common feature in TNBC. This tolerance is linked to the ability of cells to survive despite the genomic instability induced by TTK inhibition (Thu2018Disruption). The study suggests that low expression levels of APC/C components, including ANAPC13, may serve as biomarkers for predicting resistance to TTK inhibitors in breast cancer, particularly in TNBC models (Thu2018Disruption).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of ANAPC13 in cancer therapy, suggesting that its expression levels and functional status could influence the effectiveness of treatments targeting mitotic processes in cancer cells (Thu2018Disruption).

## Interactions
ANAPC13 is a component of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a crucial E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in cell cycle regulation. Within the APC/C, ANAPC13 is part of the accessory sub-complex and is associated with the TPR lobe, contributing to the structural framework that facilitates the complex's scaffolding role (Melloy2019The). The APC/C complex includes several sub-complexes, such as the TPR sub-complex, catalytic/substrate recognition sub-complex, platform sub-complex, and accessory sub-complex, where ANAPC13 is specifically mentioned (Melloy2019The).

While the specific physical interactions of ANAPC13 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, it is known that the APC/C complex interacts with various regulatory proteins and the mitotic checkpoint complex. These interactions are crucial for the APC/C's function in targeting proteins for degradation during mitosis (Melloy2019The). Phosphorylation is noted to alter interactions between APC/C subunits, which may include ANAPC13, affecting the complex's activity and regulation (Melloy2019The). ANAPC13's role in the APC/C is significant in maintaining the integrity and function of the complex, particularly in the context of cancer, where mutations in APC/C subunits, including ANAPC13, have been associated with various cancers (Melloy2019The).
