# OSGEP

## Overview
The OSGEP gene encodes the protein O-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase, which is a critical component of the KEOPS complex, a highly conserved protein assembly involved in the post-transcriptional modification of tRNA. Specifically, OSGEP functions as the catalytic subunit responsible for the threonylcarbamoyladenosine (t6A) modification, a crucial process for accurate protein translation. This protein is categorized as an enzyme with a role in tRNA modification and is essential for maintaining genome integrity and facilitating cellular responses to DNA damage. Mutations in the OSGEP gene have been linked to Galloway-Mowat syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by nephrotic syndrome and neurological abnormalities, underscoring its significance in human health (Braun2017Mutations; Xu2022Galloway–Mowat; Lin2018GallowayMowat).

## Structure
The OSGEP protein is a component of the KEOPS complex, which is involved in tRNA modification. Structurally, OSGEP is the catalytic subunit of the KEOPS complex and is crucial for the threonylcarbamoylation of tRNA, specifically the t6A modification (Braun2017Mutations; Arrondel2019Defects). The protein's structure includes a central role in the KEOPS complex, where it interacts with other subunits such as LAGE3 and GON7. In the GON7/LAGE3/OSGEP subcomplex, LAGE3 is central, binding to OSGEP on one side and GON7 on the other, with OSGEP's structure being similar to its archaeal and fungal orthologs (Arrondel2019Defects).

OSGEP is homologous to the Kae1 protein, which belongs to the actin-like ATPase domain superfamily, characterized by a central five-strand beta sheet and flanking alpha helices. This suggests that OSGEP may share similar structural features, including a cleft for ATP binding and metal ion coordination, which are essential for its function (Mao2008Atomic). The protein's quaternary structure involves its assembly into the KEOPS complex, which is essential for its biological activity (Arrondel2019Defects). Specific details about post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of OSGEP are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The OSGEP gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the KEOPS complex, which is involved in the post-transcriptional modification of tRNA, specifically the threonylcarbamoyladenosine (t6A) modification at position 37. This modification is essential for accurate and efficient protein translation, as it occurs next to the anticodon stem loop of many tRNAs that decode ANN codons (Braun2017Mutations; Lin2018GallowayMowat). The KEOPS complex, including OSGEP, is highly conserved and consists of four subunits: LAGE3, OSGEP, TP53RK, and TPRKB (Braun2017Mutations).

In healthy human cells, OSGEP plays a significant role in maintaining genome integrity and cell proliferation. It is involved in the DNA damage response (DDR) activation, which can lead to cell cycle arrest to allow DNA repair or induce apoptosis if the damage is too severe (Braun2017Mutations). OSGEP also interacts with proteins of the ARP2/3 complex, which are crucial for actin remodeling, a process important for cell migration and function (Braun2017Mutations). The protein is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to essential cellular processes such as protein synthesis, genome maintenance, and cellular response to DNA damage (Braun2017Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the OSGEP gene are associated with Galloway-Mowat syndrome (GAMOS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by early-onset nephrotic syndrome and neurological abnormalities, including microcephaly and brain anomalies (Xu2022Galloway–Mowat; Lin2018GallowayMowat). The OSGEP gene encodes a subunit of the KEOPS complex, which is crucial for tRNA modification. Disruptions in this complex can lead to impaired protein synthesis, contributing to the clinical manifestations of GAMOS (Ali2022Genomic).

In Taiwanese patients, a specific mutation in the OSGEP gene (c.740G>A, p.R247Q) has been linked to a unique clinical phenotype, including facial dysmorphisms and skeletal abnormalities, alongside severe renal and neurological symptoms (Lin2018GallowayMowat). This mutation is believed to affect the N6-threonyl-carbamoyl-adenosine (t6A) modification, impacting global protein production and leading to neurodegeneration and renal tubulopathy (Lin2018GallowayMowat).

Other variants, such as c.974G>A (p.Arg325Gln), have been identified in patients with GAMOS, presenting with severe developmental delays and nephrological complications (Wang2018Nephrological). The prognosis for individuals with GAMOS is generally poor, with many progressing to end-stage renal disease and early death (Xu2022Galloway–Mowat).

## Interactions
OSGEP is a component of the KEOPS complex, which includes the proteins LAGE3, TP53RK, and TPRKB. This complex is arranged linearly as LAGE3-OSGEP-TP53RK-TPRKB, with OSGEP serving as the catalytic subunit. The KEOPS complex is essential for tRNA modification, specifically the biosynthesis of threonylcarbamoyladenosine (t6A) (Braun2017Mutations; Costessi2012The).

OSGEP interacts with other KEOPS subunits, such as LAGE3 and TP53RK, and is stabilized by LAGE3. It also interacts with the tumor antigen PRAME, which recruits Cullin2 ubiquitin ligases to the complex. This interaction suggests a role in transcriptional regulation and possibly ubiquitination processes (Costessi2012The).

In addition to its role in the KEOPS complex, OSGEP has been shown to bind erythrocyte membrane proteins Band3 and GPA. These interactions were confirmed through far-western blotting and pull-down assays, indicating a potential role in bacterial adhesion (Song2018Identification).

OSGEP also interacts with the DNA repair protein PARP1, implicating it in the DNA damage response. It is involved in actin cytoskeleton organization through interactions with the ARP2/3 complex, which is crucial for cell migration and lamellipodia formation (Braun2017Mutations).
