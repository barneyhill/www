# SLC25A10

## Overview
The SLC25A10 gene encodes the mitochondrial dicarboxylate carrier protein, a member of the solute carrier family 25. This protein is integral to the mitochondrial inner membrane and is characterized by its role in transporting dicarboxylates such as malate and succinate, which are crucial for cellular metabolic processes. The SLC25A10 protein functions as a transmembrane carrier, facilitating the exchange of dicarboxylates with inorganic anions, thereby maintaining the balance of metabolic intermediates and contributing to cellular redox homeostasis (Palmieri2020Diseases; Palmieri2004The). Its activity is essential for processes such as gluconeogenesis, sulfur metabolism, and the maintenance of mitochondrial DNA integrity. Alterations in the expression or function of SLC25A10 have been linked to various pathological conditions, including metabolic disorders, neurological diseases, and cancer, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Punzi2017SLC25A10; Li2022Identification).

## Structure
The SLC25A10 protein, also known as the dicarboxylate carrier (DIC), is a member of the mitochondrial carrier family, characterized by a tripartite structure with six transmembrane alpha-helices. These helices form a funnel-shaped cavity that facilitates the transport of dicarboxylates such as malate and succinate across the inner mitochondrial membrane (Pasquadibisceglie2021Computational; Palmieri2004The). The protein's structure includes three homologous domains, each approximately 100 amino acids long, with two hydrophobic stretches likely spanning the membrane as alpha-helices, separated by hydrophilic regions (Palmieri2004The).

The SLC25A10 protein functions as a homodimer, with each monomer contributing to the formation of the transmembrane channel (Palmieri2004The). The transport mechanism involves conformational changes between a cytoplasmic state and a matrix state, facilitated by salt bridges formed by conserved motifs (Pasquadibisceglie2021Computational). While specific post-translational modifications for SLC25A10 are not detailed in the context, proteins in this family may undergo modifications such as phosphorylation, which can affect their transport activity and regulation (Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological).

## Function
The SLC25A10 gene encodes a mitochondrial dicarboxylate carrier protein that plays a crucial role in cellular metabolism by transporting dicarboxylates such as malate and succinate across the mitochondrial inner membrane. This transport is essential for maintaining the balance of intermediates in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, supporting processes like gluconeogenesis and sulfur metabolism (Palmieri2020Diseases; Zhou2015The). SLC25A10 operates through an electroneutral counter-exchange mechanism, exchanging dicarboxylates for inorganic anions like phosphate, sulfate, and thiosulfate, which is vital for cellular redox states and protection against oxidative stress (Palmieri2020Diseases).

In healthy cells, SLC25A10 is involved in the transport of reducing equivalents and anaplerotic Krebs cycle intermediates, contributing to the balance of NADPH/NADP+ and GSH/GSSG ratios, which are crucial for cellular redox homeostasis (Palmieri2020Diseases). The protein also plays a role in glucose metabolism and energy production, as its activity is linked to glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and mitochondrial respiration (Cai2019The). SLC25A10's function is critical for maintaining mitochondrial DNA integrity and normal cellular metabolism, with its absence or malfunction leading to increased oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction (Punzi2017SLC25A10; Cai2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the SLC25A10 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. Biallelic mutations in SLC25A10 are associated with intractable epileptic encephalopathy and complex I deficiency, leading to RNA depletion and aberrant splicing, which result in the absence of the SLC25A10 protein and its transport activity. This condition is characterized by severe neurodegenerative symptoms, including epileptic encephalopathy and mitochondrial DNA depletion (Palmieri2020Diseases; Punzi2017SLC25A10). 

Alterations in SLC25A10 expression are also linked to psychoemotional and neurological diseases, with changes potentially indicating mitochondrial dysfunction. The gene is involved in numerous central nervous system diseases, including mood disorders, anxiety, and depression (Babenko2018Altered). 

In the context of cancer, SLC25A10 has been identified as a prognostic marker for ovarian cancer. Low expression of SLC25A10 is associated with poor survival outcomes and higher resistance to chemotherapy, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2022Identification). 

In myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, SLC25A10 expression is significantly decreased, and its modulation through mild therapeutic hypothermia has been shown to alleviate myocardial injury by improving mitochondrial function (Ma2024Mild).

## Interactions
SLC25A10, also known as the dicarboxylate carrier, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular metabolism. One significant interaction is with the circadian protein CLOCK. This interaction is essential for maintaining glucose homeostasis, oxidative stress levels, and the integrity of the electron transport chain. CLOCK binds to SLC25A10, influencing mitochondrial metabolism by regulating the transport of dicarboxylates like malate and succinate across the mitochondrial membrane (Cai2019The). The binding sites for CLOCK on SLC25A10 have been identified as amino acids 43-84 and 169-210 (Cai2019The).

In the context of cancer, SLC25A10 has been shown to interact with proteins involved in cell cycle regulation. In osteosarcoma, SLC25A10 positively regulates Cyclin E1 (CCNE1), a protein that promotes cell cycle progression, while negatively regulating tumor suppressors P21 and P27. These interactions suggest an oncogenic role for SLC25A10 in osteosarcoma, influencing cell proliferation and apoptosis (Wang2020SLC25A10). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of SLC25A10 in both normal cellular metabolism and disease states.
