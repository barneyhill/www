# IL23R

## Overview
The IL23R gene encodes the interleukin-23 receptor, a type I transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the immune system. This receptor is primarily involved in the IL-23 signaling pathway, which is crucial for the differentiation and proliferation of T helper 17 (Th17) cells and other immune cells. The IL23R protein is characterized by its complex structure, including an N-terminal Ig-like domain and cytokine receptor domains, which facilitate its function as a receptor. It is predominantly expressed on the surface of immune cells such as Th17 cells, gamma delta T cells, and natural killer T cells, where it binds to the cytokine IL-23 to activate downstream signaling pathways like JAK/STAT, MAPK, and PI3K. These pathways are essential for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the regulation of immune responses. Variations in the IL23R gene have been associated with several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, highlighting its clinical significance in conditions such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and psoriasis (Di2011The; Duerr2006A; Floss2015Insights).

## Structure
The IL23R protein is a type I transmembrane protein composed of 629 amino acids, encoded by the IL23R gene located on chromosome 1p32.1-p31.2 (Parham2002A; Kan2008Identification). Its primary structure includes a signal peptide, an N-terminal Ig-like domain, and two cytokine receptor domains (Floss2015Insights). The extracellular region features a fibronectin III-like domain and a sequence similar to the WSXWS motif, which is characteristic of cytokine receptors (Parham2002A; Floss2015Insights).

The IL23R protein's tertiary structure involves a stalk region that positions the cytokine binding domains at an optimal distance from the plasma membrane, crucial for signal transduction (Hummel2017Synthetic). The cytoplasmic domain contains seven tyrosine residues, with specific motifs for binding signaling molecules like STAT3 (Floss2015Insights).

Post-translational modifications include glycosylation, with eight identified glycosylation sites contributing to protein stability and function (Floss2015Insights). The IL23R gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that may alter receptor function, including soluble forms and those with truncated domains (Floss2015Insights; Kan2008Identification). These splice variants can impact ligand-binding interactions and signaling pathways.

## Function
The IL23R gene encodes the interleukin-23 receptor, a type I transmembrane protein that is a critical component of the IL-23 signaling pathway. This receptor is primarily expressed on the surface of immune cells, including T helper 17 (Th17) cells, gamma delta T cells, natural killer T cells, and innate lymphoid cells. IL23R plays a significant role in the immune system by binding to the cytokine IL-23, which is composed of the subunits IL-23p19 and p40. This interaction is crucial for the differentiation and proliferation of Th17 cells, which are important for immune responses and maintaining mucosal barriers (Floss2015Insights).

Upon binding with IL-23, IL23R activates several signaling pathways, including the JAK/STAT, MAPK, and PI3K pathways. These pathways are essential for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the regulation of immune responses. The receptor's cytoplasmic domain contains tyrosine residues that serve as potential binding sites for Src homology 2 domains, indicating its involvement in signal transduction (Parham2002A; Floss2015Insights). IL23R's function is dynamically regulated through endocytosis and recycling, processes that are crucial for amplifying IL-23-induced signaling and cytokine production (PastorFernández2020Decoding; Sun2019IL23).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the IL23R gene are associated with several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. The IL23R gene has been significantly linked to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). A specific coding variant, rs11209026, provides strong protection against CD, while other noncoding variants are independently associated with the disease (Duerr2006A). In the Chinese Han population, IL23R variants such as rs7530511 and rs11805303 have been associated with UC susceptibility, with rs7530511 being protective and rs11805303 increasing risk (Yu2012Association).

IL23R polymorphisms are also implicated in colorectal cancer risk, particularly in rectal cancer with TP53 mutations, although these associations were not statistically significant after adjustments (Poole2012Genetic). The IL23R R381Q variant is protective against immune-mediated diseases like psoriasis, CD, and ankylosing spondylitis by impairing IL-23-induced Th17 effector responses (Di2011The).

A novel homozygous stop mutation, R381X, in IL23R causes Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease, leading to impaired IL-23 signaling and reduced immune cell function (Staels2022A). These findings highlight the clinical significance of IL23R in various diseases, emphasizing its role in immune regulation and disease susceptibility.

## Interactions
The IL23R protein is a component of the receptor complex for the cytokine IL-23, which is composed of the IL23p19 and IL12p40 subunits. IL23R specifically interacts with the IL23p19 subunit, while IL12p40 engages with IL12Rβ1 to form the functional receptor complex (Schröder2015NonCanonical; Lay2023Characterisation). Upon binding IL-23, IL23R associates with the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), leading to the activation of downstream signaling pathways involving STAT3 and other STAT proteins (Parham2002A; Lay2023Characterisation).

IL23R also undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation in response to IL-23, which is crucial for its signaling function (Parham2002A). The receptor's cytoplasmic domain contains potential binding sites for SH2 domain-containing proteins, including a site for SHP2 and sites for STAT1 and STAT3 (Parham2002A). The C115Y mutation in IL23R disrupts its interaction with IL23p19, affecting the receptor's function by blocking IL-23-induced STAT3 phosphorylation (Lay2023Characterisation).

The IL23R complex does not follow the canonical site I-II-III paradigm typically seen in cytokine receptor complexes. Instead, the interaction of p40 with IL-12Rβ1 is sufficient for receptor complex formation (Floss2015Insights). The IL23R is considered the main signal-transducing component of the IL-23 receptor complex (Floss2015Insights).
