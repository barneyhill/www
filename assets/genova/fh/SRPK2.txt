# SRPK2

## Overview
SRPK2 (SRSF protein kinase 2) is a gene that encodes a serine/arginine-rich protein-specific kinase, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of RNA splicing. The protein product of SRPK2, SRSF protein kinase 2, is involved in phosphorylating serine residues within the RS domain of splicing factors, a process essential for spliceosome assembly and the regulation of alternative splicing. This kinase activity is crucial for defining intron and exon boundaries in pre-mRNAs, thereby facilitating the expression of diverse protein isoforms (Siqueira2015Potential). Beyond its role in splicing, SRPK2 is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression and apoptosis, particularly in neuronal cells (Jang2009Interaction). Dysregulation of SRPK2 has been associated with several diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, leukemia, and melanoma, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Wang2017DeltaSecretase; Caetano2022Impaired).

## Structure
SRPK2 (SRSF protein kinase 2) is a serine/arginine-rich protein-specific kinase with a complex molecular structure that plays a crucial role in splicing regulation. The primary structure of SRPK2 includes a conserved catalytic domain responsible for phosphorylating serine residues in SR proteins (Barbosa2019Insights). The secondary structure of SRPK2 is characterized by the presence of alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its kinase activity (Barbosa2019Insights).

The tertiary structure of SRPK2 features a bilobal kinase fold, with a bi-lobed folded kinase domain that coexists with intrinsically unstructured segments, such as the spacer insert domain (SID) and N-terminal regions. These unstructured regions are thought to serve as binding sites for other proteins and are crucial for the protein's enzymatic activity (Barbosa2019Insights). The SID separates the kinase domain into N-terminal and C-terminal lobes, which may interact to facilitate the assembly of C-spine elements necessary for ATP docking (Barbosa2019Insights).

In terms of quaternary structure, SRPK2 can exist in a monomer-dimer equilibrium, with the ability to form symmetric dimers. This dimerization is suggested to be relevant for its function, potentially affecting substrate affinity and phosphorylation (Barbosa2019Insights). The protein's flexibility and conformational plasticity are key features that influence its internal architecture and enzymatic activity (Barbosa2019Insights).

## Function
SRPK2 (SRSF protein kinase 2) is a serine/arginine-rich protein-specific kinase that plays a crucial role in the regulation of RNA splicing in healthy human cells. It phosphorylates serine residues in the RS domain of splicing factors, which is essential for spliceosome assembly and the regulation of alternative splicing. This activity is vital for defining intron and exon boundaries in pre-mRNAs, allowing for the expression of different protein isoforms (Siqueira2015Potential).

In healthy cells, SRPK2 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, where it phosphorylates SR proteins, facilitating their re-import into the nucleus. This process is essential for maintaining proper splicing regulation and cellular responses to stress (Vivarelli2013Paraquat). SRPK2's activity is regulated by phosphorylation events, such as those mediated by the Akt signaling pathway, which enhances its kinase activity and promotes its nuclear translocation (Jang2009Interaction).

SRPK2 is also involved in cell cycle progression and apoptosis, particularly in neuronal cells. It can provoke post-mitotic neurons to re-enter the cell cycle by triggering the expression of cyclin D1, Cdk4, and cyclin B1, leading to neuronal cell death (Jang2009Interaction). Additionally, SRPK2 plays a role in the cellular response to DNA damage by modulating the splicing of key genes involved in maintaining genomic stability and cell survival (Vivarelli2013Paraquat).

## Clinical Significance
SRPK2 (SRSF protein kinase 2) is implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression or activity. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), SRPK2 is involved in the phosphorylation of delta-secretase and tau, contributing to AD pathogenesis. Increased SRPK2 activity in neurons leads to enhanced delta-secretase activity and tau phosphorylation, which are associated with amyloid plaque formation and neurofibrillary tangles, key features of AD. Targeting SRPK2 or its phosphorylation of delta-secretase has been suggested as a potential therapeutic strategy for AD (Wang2017DeltaSecretase; Chan2013Serinearginine).

In leukemia, particularly acute myeloid leukemia (AML), SRPK2 phosphorylates the splicing factor acinus, which regulates cyclin A1 expression, promoting leukemia cell proliferation. Overexpression of SRPK2 and acinus is observed in leukemic cells, and their activity is crucial for cell cycle progression and proliferation in leukemia (Jang2008SerineArginine).

SRPK2 is also linked to melanoma progression. High expression of SRPK2 in melanoma cells correlates with poor clinical outcomes. Targeting SRPK2 reduces melanoma cell proliferation and invasion, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in melanoma treatment (Caetano2022Impaired).

## Interactions
SRPK2 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It is a physiological substrate for Akt, which phosphorylates SRPK2, enhancing its kinase activity towards pre-mRNA splicing factors such as acinus and SC35. This phosphorylation also promotes SRPK2's nuclear translocation, which can be inhibited by 14-3-3 proteins. The interaction with 14-3-3 isoforms β and ε is dependent on Akt phosphorylation, with 14-3-3 acting as a negative regulator of SRPK2's activity, which is atypical since 14-3-3 usually acts as a positive regulator in Akt-mediated events (Jang2009Interaction).

SRPK2 also interacts with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) core protein (Cp), where it mediates phosphorylation and is involved in capsid assembly. SRPK2 binds to the 2-fold vertices of the HBV capsid, and its docking groove is crucial for this interaction. This binding regulates the phosphorylation process and prevents premature viral capsid assembly (YIP2024SRPK2).

In neurons, SRPK2 is involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. It upregulates cyclin D1 and Cdk4 expression, and its interaction with 14-3-3 can inhibit its apoptotic effects by preventing nuclear translocation (Jang2009Interaction).
