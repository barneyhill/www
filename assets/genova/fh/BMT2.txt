# BMT2

## Overview
The BMT2 gene encodes the base methyltransferase of 25S rRNA 2 homolog, a protein that plays a crucial role in the post-transcriptional modification of ribosomal RNA (rRNA). This protein is categorized as a methyltransferase, an enzyme that facilitates the transfer of methyl groups to specific substrates, thereby influencing the structure and function of rRNA. The methylation process is essential for the proper assembly and function of ribosomes, which are critical for protein synthesis within the cell. The BMT2 gene and its encoded protein are of significant interest due to their involvement in the regulation of ribosomal biogenesis and potential implications in various cellular processes and diseases.
