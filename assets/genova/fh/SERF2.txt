# SERF2

## Overview
The SERF2 gene encodes the small EDRK-rich factor 2 protein, a highly charged and partially disordered protein involved in cellular stress responses. This protein is characterized by its ability to bind RNA G-quadruplex structures and promote stress granule formation through liquid-liquid phase separation, a process critical for cellular organization under stress conditions (Sahoo2023SERF2). SERF2 is ubiquitously expressed across human tissues and is highly conserved among eukaryotes, indicating its fundamental biological role (Sahoo2024Backbone). The protein's interactions with RNA and aggregation-prone proteins, such as amyloid-beta, suggest its involvement in neurodegenerative diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Balasubramaniam2018Structural; Stroo2023Deletion).

## Structure
The SERF2 protein is a small, highly charged protein consisting of 59 amino acids, with a structure that includes three short helices at the N-terminus and a longer helix from residues 37-46 (Sahoo2024Backbone). It is rich in lysine and arginine, contributing to its highly charged nature (Balasubramaniam2018Structural). Structural modeling predicts that SERF2 consists of two α-helices linked by a short random coil, resembling a helix-turn-helix structure rather than the typical UBA-domain bundle of three α-helices (Balasubramaniam2018Structural). 

SERF2 is partially disordered, which allows it to interact with a wide range of proteins and RNA structures, such as RNA G-quadruplexes (Sahoo2023SERF2). This disordered nature contributes to its role in promoting protein aggregation and stress granule formation (Sahoo2023SERF2). The protein is predicted to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation, a process relevant to stress granule formation (Sahoo2023SERF2). 

SERF2 exists in four major isoforms, with the 59-residue sequence considered canonical (Sahoo2024Backbone). It is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and is highly conserved across eukaryotes (Sahoo2024Backbone). The protein's dynamic and flexible nature poses challenges to understanding its precise mechanism of action (Sahoo2024Backbone).

## Function
The SERF2 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in stress granule formation in human cells. Under normal conditions, SERF2 is partially localized in the nucleus and enriched in the nucleolus. However, during stress conditions, such as oxidative or osmotic stress, SERF2 relocates to the cytoplasm and forms puncti that colocalize with stress granule marker proteins, indicating its involvement in stress granule assembly or maintenance (Sahoo2023SERF2). SERF2 specifically binds to RNA G-quadruplex structures, which are enriched in stress granules, and this interaction is crucial for the formation of these granules (Sahoo2023SERF2).

The protein undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation in the presence of RNA G-quadruplexes, suggesting its role in the early steps of stress granule formation (Sahoo2023SERF2). This phase separation is essential for cellular organization under stress conditions, and SERF2's interaction with RNA G-quadruplexes may influence stress granule dynamics and cellular stress responses (Sahoo2023SERF2). SERF2's function in healthy human cells appears to be linked to its ability to regulate stress granule formation and RNA G-quadruplex interactions, which are important for maintaining cellular homeostasis during stress (Sahoo2023SERF2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the SERF2 gene have been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, primarily due to its role in protein aggregation. SERF2 is involved in the aggregation of proteins such as amyloid-beta, which is a key factor in Alzheimer's disease. Studies have shown that the deletion of SERF2 in mice leads to changes in the structure of amyloid deposits, suggesting that SERF2 influences the nucleation phase of amyloid fibril formation, which may affect the toxicity and clinical phenotypes associated with amyloid pathology (Stroo2023Deletion). 

In human neuroblastoma cells, knockdown of SERF2 has been shown to reduce amyloid aggregation, indicating its involvement in aggregate progression and its potential role in modulating protein aggregation pathways (Balasubramaniam2018Structural). The gene's dysregulation may also impact cellular stress responses and apoptosis, as suggested by changes in cell cycle and proliferation-related genes observed in SERF2 knockout models (Stroo2023Deletion). These findings highlight the clinical significance of SERF2 in understanding and potentially targeting protein aggregation pathways in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (Cleverley2021A).

## Interactions
SERF2 is an RNA G-quadruplex binding protein that plays a significant role in promoting stress granule formation through its interactions with RNA and proteins. It binds strongly to RNA G-quadruplex structures, such as TERRA, G4C2, and UG4U, facilitating liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and stress granule formation. These interactions are specific to RNA G-quadruplexes, as SERF2 does not phase separate with non-quadruplex forming RNAs like polyU and polyA (Sahoo2023SERF2).

SERF2 interacts with RNA G-quadruplexes primarily through its N-terminal residues, with additional contacts in multimeric complexes. These interactions involve a hydrophilic core formed by SERF2 residues, which constrains its dynamics and forms a planar contact surface with the RNA (Sahoo2023SERF2). The binding of SERF2 to these structures is characterized by sub-micromolar affinities, similar to other known RNA G-quadruplex binding proteins (Sahoo2023SERF2).

In addition to its interactions with RNA, SERF2 is involved in protein aggregation processes. It interacts with aggregation-prone proteins like amyloid-beta and alpha-synuclein, influencing amyloid fibril formation and potentially altering the structural conformation of these proteins (Stroo2023Deletion; Sahoo2024Backbone). These interactions are crucial for understanding SERF2's role in neurodegenerative diseases.
