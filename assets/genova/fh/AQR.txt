# AQR

## Overview
The AQR gene encodes the aquarius intron-binding spliceosomal factor, a multifunctional RNA helicase that plays a pivotal role in both RNA processing and DNA repair mechanisms. This protein is integral to the spliceosome, a complex responsible for the splicing of pre-mRNA, and is involved in the intron-binding complex (IBC), which is essential for spliceosome assembly and function (De2015The). Beyond its role in RNA splicing, aquarius is crucial for maintaining genomic stability by participating in the homologous recombination (HR) repair pathway. It facilitates the resolution of R-loop structures, thereby preventing DNA damage and ensuring proper DNA repair processes (Sakasai2017Aquarius). The protein's interactions with other spliceosomal components and DNA repair proteins underscore its importance in cellular homeostasis and genomic integrity (Sakasai2017Aquarius; De2015The).

## Function
The AQR gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability and facilitating DNA repair processes in healthy human cells. AQR is involved in the homologous recombination (HR) repair pathway, which is essential for repairing DNA double-strand breaks. It helps prevent R-loop-derived DNA damage, which can lead to genomic instability by resolving RNA-DNA hybrids that form during transcription (Sakasai2017Aquarius). AQR's role in HR is linked to its ability to facilitate the loading of Rad51, a protein critical for HR repair, by removing RNA from R-loops (Sakasai2017Aquarius).

AQR is also necessary for the proper expression of CtIP, a protein involved in DNA end resection, a key step in HR. Depletion of AQR results in reduced CtIP levels and impaired HR repair, highlighting its importance in stabilizing CtIP protein (Sakasai2017Aquarius). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the accurate and efficient splicing of pre-mRNA, a process essential for producing functional mRNA and proteins. This splicing activity is independent of its helicase function, indicating a multifaceted role in cellular processes (Sakasai2017Aquarius).

## Interactions
Aquarius (AQR) is a multifunctional RNA helicase involved in various protein and nucleic acid interactions within the spliceosome. It is a component of the intron-binding complex (IBC), a pentameric assembly that includes proteins such as hSyf1, CCDC16, hIsy1, and CypE. These proteins co-migrate with Aquarius, indicating their association in the IBC, which is crucial for spliceosome assembly and function (De2015The). The ARM domain of Aquarius acts as a protein-protein interaction scaffold, facilitating the formation of the IBC and its integration into spliceosomes (De2015The).

Aquarius also interacts with U2 snRNP proteins, specifically SF3a and SF3b, within activated spliceosomes. These interactions help position Aquarius on the intron, highlighting its role in spliceosome assembly (De2015The). In addition to its spliceosomal functions, Aquarius is involved in homologous recombination repair, where it processes R-loops and interacts with proteins such as XAB2 and CtIP. These interactions are essential for maintaining genomic stability and facilitating DNA repair processes (Sakasai2017Aquarius).
