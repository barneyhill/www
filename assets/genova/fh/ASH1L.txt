# ASH1L

## Overview
ASH1L is a gene that encodes the ASH1-like histone lysine methyltransferase, a protein involved in chromatin modification and gene expression regulation. This protein is categorized as a histone methyltransferase, which specifically targets lysine residues on histone proteins, influencing chromatin structure and transcriptional activity. ASH1L plays a pivotal role in various biological processes, including immune response regulation, muscle development, and DNA repair. It achieves these functions through its enzymatic activity, which involves the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4) and lysine 36 (H3K36), modifications that are generally associated with transcriptional activation (Castiglioni2018The; Xia2013Histone). The protein's structure includes several domains, such as the SET domain responsible for its methyltransferase activity, and it interacts with various proteins to facilitate its role in chromatin dynamics (Balbo2017ASH1L; Yu2022Structural). Mutations in the ASH1L gene have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its importance in normal brain development and function (Qin2021Deficiency; Cordova2024Expansion).

## Structure
The ASH1L protein is a histone methyltransferase that plays a crucial role in chromatin modification and gene expression regulation. It contains several distinct domains, including an AWS (associated with SET) domain, a SET domain, a cysteine-rich post-SET domain, a bromodomain, a plant homeodomain (PHD) zinc finger, and a bromo-adjacent homology (BAH) domain (An2011Crystal; Yu2022Structural). The SET domain is responsible for the protein's lysine methyltransferase activity, specifically targeting histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36) (An2011Crystal; Hou2019Structural).

The PHD finger of ASH1L, spanning residues 2573-2624, is involved in recognizing methylated histone H3K4. It features a double-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet and a helical turn, anchored by two zinc atoms in a cross-brace topology (Yu2022Structural). The PHD finger can bind all three methylation states of H3K4, facilitated by a narrow binding groove and specific residue interactions (Yu2022Structural).

The protein's structure is regulated by an autoinhibitory loop in the post-SET domain, which blocks the substrate binding pocket and is crucial for controlling its enzymatic activity (An2011Crystal; Rogawski2015Two). The interaction with Mrg15 protein can induce conformational changes, enhancing ASH1L's methyltransferase activity (Hou2019Structural).

## Function
The ASH1L gene encodes a histone methyltransferase that plays a significant role in various cellular processes by modifying chromatin structure. ASH1L is involved in the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4) and lysine 36 (H3K36), modifications associated with transcriptional activation. In the immune system, ASH1L regulates the expression of the ubiquitin-editing enzyme A20, which is crucial for suppressing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in macrophages. This regulation is achieved through the modulation of NF-kB and MAPK signaling pathways, highlighting ASH1L's role in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing inflammatory autoimmune diseases (Xia2013Histone).

In the context of muscle development, ASH1L is essential for myoblast fusion, a critical process in muscle formation and regeneration. It promotes the expression of genes involved in muscle differentiation, such as Cdon, by counteracting Polycomb group-mediated gene silencing and enhancing H3K36me2 levels on active genes (Castiglioni2018The).

ASH1L also plays a crucial role in DNA repair, particularly in the global-genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) pathway. It facilitates the handoff between damage recognition factors, ensuring efficient repair of UV-induced DNA damage by stabilizing the binding of the XPC complex to chromatin (Balbo2017ASH1L).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ASH1L gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability (ID), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Shen2019De; Cordova2024Expansion). These mutations, particularly loss-of-function variants, can lead to symptoms such as social deficits, repetitive behaviors, seizures, and cognitive impairments (Gao2020Loss; Qin2021Deficiency). ASH1L is crucial for normal brain development, and its deficiency in the prefrontal cortex has been linked to synaptic dysfunction and excitation/inhibition imbalances, contributing to ASD and epilepsy (Qin2021Deficiency).

ASH1L-related disorders also present with a variety of congenital anomalies, including skeletal, muscular, and sleep differences, as well as dysmorphic facial features, although these lack a consistent pattern (Cordova2024Expansion). In some cases, ASH1L mutations are associated with multiple congenital anomalies and learning difficulties (Shen2019De). The gene's role in histone methylation and chromatin modification is critical, and disruptions can lead to widespread gene expression changes, affecting neuronal signaling and synaptic function (Gao2020Loss; Qin2021Deficiency).

## Interactions
ASH1L, a histone lysine methyltransferase, engages in several critical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in chromatin modification and gene regulation. ASH1L interacts with DDB2, a protein that recognizes UV-induced lesions in nucleosome cores, facilitating the global-genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) process. This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of ASH1L to chromatin upon UV damage, leading to the methylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me3), which stabilizes the docking of the XPC complex to damaged nucleosomes (Balbo2017ASH1L).

ASH1L also forms a complex with MRG15, which aids in the navigation of XPC and TFIIH through chromatin to induce GG-NER hotspots. This complex recruits the histone chaperone FACT to DNA lesions, facilitating the delivery of DNA lesions to the TFIIH verifier (Maritz2023ASH1LMRG15).

In the context of MLL leukemia, ASH1L interacts with LEDGF, a protein associated with mixed-lineage leukemia, to maintain histone H3K36 dimethylation (H3K36me2). This interaction is essential for the recruitment and stabilization of MLL on chromatin, thereby activating target gene expression in leukemia cells (Zhu2016ASH1L).
