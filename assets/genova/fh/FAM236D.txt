# FAM236D

## Overview
FAM236D is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 236 member D. This protein is part of a larger family characterized by conserved sequence motifs, although its specific biological role remains to be fully elucidated. The FAM236D protein is implicated in various cellular processes, potentially including signal transduction pathways, given its structural features that suggest a role in intracellular signaling. While the precise function of FAM236D in human physiology is not yet completely understood, ongoing research aims to clarify its involvement in cellular mechanisms and its potential implications in health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
