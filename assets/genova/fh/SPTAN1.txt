# SPTAN1

## Overview
The SPTAN1 gene encodes the spectrin alpha, non-erythrocytic 1 protein, a critical component of the cytoskeleton in metazoan cells. This protein belongs to the spectrin family, which is known for its role in maintaining cellular structure and integrity. Spectrin alpha, non-erythrocytic 1, is involved in forming a stabilizing mesh beneath the plasma membrane, contributing to cell shape, stability, and signaling. It plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, signaling, and growth regulation, particularly through its involvement in the Hippo signaling pathway. Mutations in the SPTAN1 gene are linked to several neurological disorders, highlighting its importance in neurodevelopment and cellular function (Zhang2013Spectrin:; Su2023SPTAN1NUMB; Syrbe2017Delineating).

## Structure
The SPTAN1 gene encodes the non-erythrocytic alpha II spectrin protein, which is a crucial component of the cytoskeleton in metazoan cells. The primary structure of alpha II spectrin includes a sequence of amino acids forming spectrin repeats, which are modular structures that contribute to its flexibility and function (Zhang2013Spectrin:). These repeats form a triple-helix supercoil connected by an α-helical linker, allowing the protein to expand and contract (Zhang2013Spectrin:).

The tertiary structure of alpha II spectrin involves the folding of these helices into a rod-like shape, characterized by a series of triple helix bundles forming a left-handed coiled-coil structure (Zhang2013Spectrin:). The quaternary structure involves the formation of heterodimers with beta spectrins, which further assemble into heterotetramers, providing mechanical support and maintaining regular spacing in the cytoskeleton (Xu2013Actin; Liu2019Axonal).

Alpha II spectrin contains several functional domains, including a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, a calmodulin-binding domain, and a calcium-binding EF-domain (Liu2019Axonal). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, particularly at tyrosine 1176, play a role in its interaction with other proteins and its stability (Su2023SPTAN1NUMB).

## Function
The SPTAN1 gene encodes the spectrin α chain, nonerythrocytic 1, a cytoskeletal protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining cell shape, stability, and integrity. In healthy human cells, SPTAN1 is involved in several key molecular processes. It stabilizes the plasma membrane and is essential for cell adhesion and signaling. SPTAN1 is particularly important in the cochlear hair cells, where it maintains the structure and function of stereocilia and cuticular plates, which are vital for hearing. Its absence leads to rapid outer hair cell loss and early-onset deafness due to abnormal actin distribution and decreased cell spreading, affecting focal adhesion and integrin signaling (Yao2021Essential).

SPTAN1 also plays a significant role in regulating cell growth and preventing oncogenesis through the Hippo signaling pathway. It interacts with NUMB proteins to sense cell density, which is crucial for modulating Hippo signaling and restraining cell proliferation. At high cell density, SPTAN1 is phosphorylated, facilitating the recruitment of NUMB1/2 to the plasma membrane, which activates Hippo signaling and inhibits cell growth. This mechanism is essential for maintaining contact inhibition and preventing tumorigenesis (Su2023SPTAN1NUMB).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SPTAN1 gene, which encodes the non-erythrocytic αII spectrin, are associated with a range of neurological disorders. These include early infantile epileptic encephalopathy type 5 (EIEE5), characterized by severe developmental delay, infantile spasms, and spastic quadriplegia. The mutations often result in a spectrum of neurodevelopmental phenotypes, from mild intellectual disability to severe encephalopathy, with some cases leading to early childhood death (Wang2018Critical; Syrbe2017Delineating). 

Mutations in the C-terminal region of αII spectrin can disrupt the formation of α/β spectrin heterotetramers, leading to spectrin complex aggregation and potentially severe brain atrophy and hypomyelination (Tohyama2015SPTAN1; Syrbe2017Delineating). These mutations are linked to conditions such as West syndrome and other severe early infantile epileptic encephalopathies (Rapaccini2018A). 

SPTAN1 mutations have also been implicated in hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive weakness and spasticity of the lower limbs. Biallelic variants in SPTAN1 have been identified in patients with HSP, suggesting a potential role in this condition (Leveille2019SPTAN1). The clinical manifestations of SPTAN1-related disorders are diverse, emphasizing the importance of genetic testing for accurate diagnosis and management (Syrbe2017Delineating).

## Interactions
SPTAN1, or spectrin alpha, non-erythrocytic 1, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in maintaining cellular structure and function. SPTAN1 forms heterodimers with beta spectrin (SPTBN1), creating a stabilizing mesh beneath the plasma membrane. This interaction is essential for the structural integrity of cochlear hair cells, where SPTAN1 and SPTBN1 co-localize in stereocilia and cuticular plates, playing a role in mechanical stress resistance (Yao2021Essential).

SPTAN1 also interacts with proteins involved in focal adhesion signaling, such as Integrin β1, TALIN-1, and VINCULIN, which are crucial for maintaining cell shape and structure. The absence of SPTAN1 affects the formation of integrin-focal adhesions, leading to abnormal actin cytoskeletal structure (Yao2021Essential).

In the context of cancer, SPTAN1 interacts with MLH1, a DNA mismatch repair protein, influencing cellular motility and potentially affecting tumor progression. MLH1 deficiency is associated with reduced SPTAN1 expression, impacting cell migration (Hinrichsen2014Reduced).

SPTAN1 is also involved in the Hippo signaling pathway through its interaction with NUMB isoforms. Phosphorylation of SPTAN1 at tyrosine 1176 is crucial for recruiting NUMB1/2 to the plasma membrane, which regulates YAP activity and cell growth in response to cell density (Su2023SPTAN1NUMB).
