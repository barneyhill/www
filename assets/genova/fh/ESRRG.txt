# ESRRG

## Overview
ESRRG, or estrogen-related receptor gamma, is a gene that encodes a nuclear receptor protein involved in various physiological processes, particularly in energy metabolism and mitochondrial function. The protein, categorized as a nuclear receptor, plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression related to energy homeostasis and cellular differentiation. It is predominantly expressed in energy-demanding tissues such as the brain, heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and brown adipose tissue, where it influences mitochondrial biogenesis and thermogenesis. ESRRG's function is mediated through its ability to bind specific DNA sequences and interact with coactivators and ligands, modulating transcriptional activity. The receptor's involvement in critical metabolic pathways underscores its significance in maintaining cellular energy balance and its potential implications in clinical conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases (Müller2020ESRRG; Fox2022Estrogen-related).

## Structure
ESRRG (estrogen related receptor gamma) is a nuclear receptor protein characterized by a complex molecular structure. Its primary structure is composed of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its higher-level structures. The secondary structure of ESRRG includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and functional conformation.

The tertiary structure of ESRRG is notable for containing a ligand-binding domain and a DNA-binding domain. These domains are crucial for the protein's role in gene regulation, allowing it to interact with specific DNA sequences and ligands. The ligand-binding domain is particularly important for the receptor's ability to modulate transcriptional activity in response to various signals.

In terms of quaternary structure, ESRRG can form homodimers. This dimerization is essential for its function as a transcription factor, as it enhances the protein's ability to bind DNA and regulate gene expression effectively.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are common in ESRRG and play a significant role in modulating its activity and stability. These modifications can influence the receptor's interaction with other proteins and its overall function within the cell.

## Function
ESRRG (estrogen-related receptor gamma) is a nuclear receptor that plays a significant role in regulating energy metabolism, mitochondrial biogenesis, and cellular differentiation. It is highly expressed in energy-dependent tissues such as the brain, heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and brown adipose tissue (BAT) (Müller2020ESRRG). In brown adipocytes, ESRRG is crucial for mitochondrial function and thermogenesis, as it regulates the expression of UCP1, a protein involved in heat production by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria (Müller2020ESRRG). ESRRG interacts with GADD45γ to regulate UCP1 levels during cold adaptation, facilitating the conversion of white to brite/beige adipocytes (Müller2020ESRRG).

In the heart, ESRRG is essential for the transition from carbohydrate-based to lipid-based metabolism, which is critical for postnatal heart function. ERRγ null mice exhibit significant cardiac abnormalities, including impaired oxidative metabolism and reduced complex I activity, highlighting its role in maintaining mitochondrial processes and energy production in heart cells (Alaynick2007ERRγ). ESRRG also influences kidney development, where it is involved in early branching events of the ureteric duct, essential for normal renal papilla development (Berry2010Esrrg).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ESRRG gene, which encodes the estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERRγ), have been implicated in several neurodegenerative conditions, particularly Parkinson's disease (PD). ERRγ is crucial for regulating mitochondrial and synaptic genes, and its deficiency in dopaminergic neurons can lead to increased vulnerability to synucleinopathy, a condition associated with PD. Studies have shown that deletion of ERRγ in these neurons results in motor deficits, cell loss, and reduced mitochondrial numbers, mimicking PD-like phenotypes (Fox2022Estrogen-related). ERRγ deficiency also affects the expression of genes involved in autophagy and synaptic maintenance, which are critical in PD pathology (Fox2022Estrogen-related).

ERRγ overexpression has been found to have a neuroprotective effect, potentially reducing synuclein load and delaying cell loss in PD models (Fox2022Estrogen-related). The receptor's role in modulating gene expression is complex, involving interactions with transcriptional repressors and coactivators, and it may act as a sensor for reactive oxygen species, linking it to oxidative stress-related neurodegeneration (Fox2022Estrogen-related). These findings suggest that ERRγ could be a potential target for therapeutic strategies aimed at enhancing dopaminergic neuron resilience in PD.

## Interactions
ESRRG (estrogen-related receptor gamma) is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function in gene regulation. ESRRG interacts with GADD45γ to regulate UCP1 levels during cold adaptation, which is crucial for thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (Müller2020ESRRG). This interaction highlights ESRRG's role in energy metabolism and mitochondrial function.

ESRRG's DNA-binding domain (DBD) contains two highly conserved zinc finger motifs that recognize and bind to the ERR response element (ERRE) on DNA. This binding can occur as a monomer, homodimer, or heterodimer, affecting its transcriptional activities (Zou2021The). The ligand-binding domain (LBD) of ESRRG is involved in its dimerization and interaction with coactivators and ligands, which modulate its transcriptional function (Zou2021The).

ESRRG is also regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1A) and affects the expression of genes such as CYP19A1 and VEGFA, influencing placental vascularization and metabolism (Zou2021The). The interaction between ESRRG and SIRT1, where SIRT1 can deacetylate and increase ESRRA DNA-binding activity, suggests a potential interaction with ESRRG due to their structural similarities (Zou2021The).
