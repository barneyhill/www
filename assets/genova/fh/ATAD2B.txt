# ATAD2B

## Overview
ATAD2B is a gene that encodes the ATPase family AAA domain containing 2B protein, which is a nuclear protein involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. The protein is characterized by the presence of an AAA+ ATPase domain and a bromodomain, which are crucial for its function in recognizing acetylated lysine residues on histone proteins. This recognition plays a significant role in chromatin structure regulation and gene expression. The ATAD2B protein is particularly expressed during neuronal differentiation, suggesting its involvement in early developmental processes. Its bromodomain is known to bind preferentially to diacetylated histone H4, which is associated with newly synthesized histones following DNA replication. Dysregulation of ATAD2B's histone-binding activity has been implicated in cancer development, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Leachman2010ATAD2B; Lloyd2020Structural; Phillips2022Impact).

## Structure
The ATAD2B protein is a nuclear protein that contains two conserved domains: an AAA+ ATPase domain and a C-terminal bromodomain. The AAA+ ATPase domain is part of a large superfamily of proteins that typically form a hexameric complex, which recognizes ATP to drive molecular remodeling reactions (Lloyd2018Structural; Lloyd2020Structural). The bromodomain of ATAD2B is highly homologous to the ATAD2 bromodomain, with 74.7% sequence identity and 94.4% amino acid similarity (Lloyd2018Structural; Lloyd2020Structural).

The ATAD2B bromodomain recognizes acetylated lysine residues on the N-terminal tails of histones H4 and H2A, with the strongest binding affinity to the histone H4K5ac ligand (Lloyd2018Structural; Lloyd2020Structural). The structure of the ATAD2B bromodomain includes flexible ZA and BC loop regions, which are crucial for ligand binding (Lloyd2018Structural). Specific residues such as Glu 991, Tyr 995, and Lys 1048 play significant roles in ligand coordination (Lloyd2018Structural; Lloyd2020Structural).

A splice variant of the ATAD2B bromodomain, referred to as ATAD2Bshort, lacks five amino acids in the ZA loop, resulting in a bromodomain that does not bind histone ligands or inhibitors (Lloyd2018Structural; Lloyd2020Structural). This variant is expressed alongside the canonical form across various cell types (Lloyd2018Structural).

## Function
The ATAD2B gene encodes a nuclear protein that is part of the ATPase family, characterized by the presence of an AAA domain and a bromodomain. These domains are involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional control, suggesting a role in regulating gene expression and maintaining chromatin structure (Leachman2010ATAD2B; Lloyd2020Structural). In healthy human cells, ATAD2B is expressed during neuronal differentiation, with strong expression observed in the nuclei of cells in the forebrain and hippocampus during specific developmental stages, indicating its involvement in early neuronal differentiation processes (Leachman2010ATAD2B).

The ATAD2B bromodomain functions as a 'reader' of acetylated lysine residues on histone proteins, recognizing specific patterns of acetylation that are associated with chromatin decompaction and transcriptional activation (Lloyd2020Structural; Phillips2022Impact). This recognition is crucial for chromatin regulation, as ATAD2B preferentially binds to diacetylated histone H4, which is linked to newly synthesized histones following DNA replication (Lloyd2020Structural; Phillips2022Impact). The protein's activity is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it interacts with chromatin and other nuclear components, potentially contributing to DNA repair and other nuclear processes (Phillips2022Impact).

## Clinical Significance
The ATAD2B gene encodes a protein that plays a role in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation. Dysregulation of histone acetylation patterns recognized by the ATAD2B bromodomain has been implicated in cancer development. The ATAD2B bromodomain preferentially binds to mono- and di-acetylated histones, such as H4K5acK8ac, which are associated with active gene promoters. This suggests that ATAD2B may contribute to cancer by recognizing hyperacetylated states of histone H4, potentially affecting gene expression linked to tumorigenesis (Lloyd2018Structural; Lloyd2020Structural).

The ATAD2B bromodomain is structurally similar to its paralogue ATAD2, which has been associated with poor survival rates in several solid tumors. Although less is known about ATAD2B, its broader substrate specificity and distinct histone-binding preferences suggest it may play a unique role in cancer biology (Lloyd2018Structural; Lloyd2020Structural). Alternative splicing of the ATAD2B gene, resulting in a shorter bromodomain variant, may regulate its binding activity and influence its role in cancer progression (Lloyd2018Structural; Lloyd2020Structural). Further in vivo experimentation is necessary to fully understand the clinical significance of ATAD2B in cancer (Lloyd2020Structural).

## Interactions
The ATAD2B bromodomain is involved in recognizing acetylated lysine residues on histone proteins, playing a role in chromatin structure regulation and gene transcription. It specifically interacts with acetylated histone ligands, such as histones H4, H2A, and H2A.X, recognizing acetyllysine modifications. The ATAD2B bromodomain demonstrates a broader substrate specificity compared to its paralog ATAD2, binding to larger acyl modifications like propionyllysine and butyryllysine, although it does not bind to crotonyllysine (Lloyd2018Structural; Lloyd2020Structural).

The ATAD2B bromodomain is identified as a diacetyllysine reader module, with a preference for histone ligands with multiple Kac modifications, such as H4K5acK8ac, H4K5acK12ac, and H4K5acK16ac, albeit with weaker affinities (Lloyd2018Structural; Lloyd2020Structural). The flexibility of the bromodomain reader module is crucial for the selection and recruitment of histone ligands, with specific residues in the ZA loop playing a key role in binding (Lloyd2020Structural).

The ATAD2B bromodomain's ability to recognize hyperacetylated histone H4 suggests a potential association with active gene promoters and dysregulation in cancer development (Lloyd2020Structural). The study of ATAD2B interactions highlights the importance of structural changes in flexible loop regions for ligand recognition and binding (Lloyd2020Structural).
