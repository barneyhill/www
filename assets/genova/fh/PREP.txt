# PREP

## Overview
The PREP gene encodes the enzyme prolyl endopeptidase, a serine protease that plays a significant role in the metabolism of proline-containing peptides. This enzyme is characterized by its ability to cleave peptide bonds at the carboxyl side of proline residues, which is crucial for the processing of various neuropeptides involved in cognitive functions and intracellular signaling (GarcíaHorsman2007On). Structurally, prolyl endopeptidase consists of a catalytic α/β-hydrolase domain and a β-propeller domain, which together facilitate substrate access and enzymatic activity (Fülöp1998Prolyl; Juhász2005Unclosed). Beyond its enzymatic functions, prolyl endopeptidase is implicated in several cellular processes, including intracellular transport and protein secretion, through its interactions with proteins such as tubulin and α-synuclein (Morawski2011Role; Savolainen2015Prolyl). Alterations in the expression or activity of the PREP gene have been associated with neurological and psychiatric disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Männistö2017Mechanism).

## Structure
Prolyl oligopeptidase (PREP) is a serine protease characterized by a two-domain structure: a catalytic α/β-hydrolase domain and a seven-bladed β-propeller domain. The catalytic domain contains a triad of residues—Ser554, Asp641, and His680—essential for its enzymatic activity (Fülöp1998Prolyl; Rea2011Prolyl). The α/β-hydrolase domain exhibits a fold common to other hydrolases, with a central eight-stranded β-sheet (Fülöp1998Prolyl).

The β-propeller domain, which acts as a gating filter, is composed of seven blades, each formed by four anti-parallel β-strands. This domain is unique in that it lacks the typical 'Velcro' closure seen in other propeller proteins, allowing for potential movement of the blades and facilitating substrate access to the active site (Tsirigotaki2017Dynamics; Juhász2005Unclosed). The β-propeller domain is stabilized mainly by hydrophobic interactions (Rea2011Prolyl).

PREP is typically monomeric, and its structure allows it to hydrolyze peptides up to 30 residues long, with a preference for proline-containing sequences (Rea2011Prolyl). The enzyme's structure and dynamics are crucial for its function, with conformational changes between open and closed states influencing substrate access and catalysis (Tsirigotaki2017Dynamics).

## Function
Prolyl endopeptidase (PREP) is a serine peptidase that cleaves peptide bonds at the carboxyl side of proline residues, playing a crucial role in the metabolism of neuropeptides such as substance P, arginine vasopressin, thyroliberin, and gonadoliberin (GarcíaHorsman2007On). PREP is primarily localized in the cytoplasm but is also found in the perinuclear space and associated with the microtubulin cytoskeleton, indicating its involvement in intracellular transport and protein secretion (Schulz2005Subcellular; Morawski2011Role). It interacts with tubulin, suggesting a role in microtubule-associated processes such as intracellular trafficking and vesicle sorting (Schulz2005Subcellular; Morawski2011Role).

Inhibition of PREP has been shown to increase protein/peptide secretion, highlighting its regulatory role in secretion processes (Schulz2005Subcellular). PREP is also implicated in cognitive functions, affecting learning and memory, and is involved in the proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein, potentially influencing Alzheimer's disease pathology (Morawski2011Role). Its activity is linked to various physiological functions, including cell division, differentiation, and neurogenesis (GarcíaHorsman2007On).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or activity of the PREP gene, which encodes prolyl endopeptidase, have been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. In neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, changes in PREP expression have been observed, particularly an increase in glial cells during neuroinflammation and co-localization with pathological plaques, suggesting a role in disease progression (Männistö2017Mechanism). The interaction of PREP with proteins like α-synuclein, which is associated with neurodegenerative diseases, indicates that PREP may influence protein aggregation processes independent of its enzymatic activity (Männistö2017Mechanism).

In psychiatric disorders, fluctuations in PREP levels have been noted in conditions such as depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder, although no direct peptide substrates have been identified (Männistö2017Mechanism). PREP's interaction with inositol signaling enzymes suggests a potential role in mood regulation, contrasting with the effects of mood-stabilizing drugs like lithium (Männistö2017Mechanism). Despite these associations, the clinical significance of PREP mutations or expression changes remains unclear, with no direct link to specific neuropeptides or behavioral outcomes established (Männistö2017Mechanism).

## Interactions
Prolyl oligopeptidase (PREP) is known to participate in various protein-protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. PREP interacts directly with α-synuclein (aSyn), a protein implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease. This interaction enhances aSyn dimerization, which may serve as a nucleation point for aSyn aggregation. The interaction occurs in both live cells and cell-free systems, and is independent of PREP's enzymatic activity (Savolainen2015Prolyl). Inhibitors of PREP, such as KYP-2047, can reduce aSyn dimerization and promote autophagic clearance of aSyn, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for synucleinopathies (Savolainen2015Prolyl).

PREP also interacts with α-tubulin and growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43), affecting neural plasticity and axonal transport within neurons. These interactions suggest a chaperone-like role for PREP, influencing protein aggregation processes independently of its peptidase activity (Männistö2017Mechanism). Additionally, PREP is involved in intracellular transport processes, particularly along the microtubule cytoskeleton, through its interaction with tubulin, which may affect neuronal growth and differentiation (Morawski2011Role). These interactions highlight PREP's multifaceted role in cellular function beyond its enzymatic activity.
