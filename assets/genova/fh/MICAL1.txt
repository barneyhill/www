# MICAL1

## Overview
MICAL1 is a gene that encodes the protein microtubule associated monooxygenase, calponin and LIM domain containing 1, which is a multidomain flavoprotein monooxygenase. This protein plays a crucial role in the regulation of oxidative stress and cytoskeletal dynamics within cells. It is characterized by several conserved domains, including an N-terminal flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) binding domain, a calponin homology (CH) domain, a LIM domain, and a C-terminal coiled-coil (CC) domain. These domains facilitate its function in cellular processes such as actin depolymerization, vesicle trafficking, and cell motility. MICAL1 is involved in various cellular signaling pathways, interacting with proteins like Rab GTPases and plexin receptors, which are essential for processes like axon guidance and cell migration. The protein's activity is regulated through an autoinhibitory mechanism and is implicated in several diseases, including acute myeloid leukemia and pancreatic cancer, due to its altered expression or mutations (Deng2016MICAL1; Song2024MICAL1; Vanoni2017Structurefunction).

## Structure
MICAL1 is a multidomain flavoenzyme involved in cytoskeleton dynamics, characterized by several distinct domains. The protein contains an N-terminal monooxygenase (MO) domain, which is structurally related to p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase, a class of FAD-dependent monooxygenases. This domain is crucial for its NADPH-dependent F-actin depolymerization activity (Siebold2005Highresolution; Vanoni2017Structurefunction). The MO domain features a large FAD-binding domain and a smaller cap domain, with a unique subdomain forming a basic electrostatic potential patch, possibly for docking with acidic protein partners like actin (Vanoni2017Structurefunction).

Following the MO domain, MICAL1 includes a calponin homology (CH) domain and a LIM domain. The CH domain is involved in actin binding and is similar to the CH2 domain of α-actinin, a well-characterized actin-binding protein (Vanoni2017Structurefunction). The LIM domain consists of two tandem zinc fingers and plays a role in cytoskeleton organization and signal transduction (Vanoni2017Structurefunction).

The C-terminal region of MICAL1 contains coiled-coil motifs and a proline-rich region for interaction with SH3 domains. This region is implicated in autoinhibition and interaction with semaphorin-activated PlexA, suggesting a role in stabilizing an inactive conformation (Vanoni2017Structurefunction). MICAL1 can exist as a mixture of monomers and dimers in solution, with the full-length protein exhibiting both forms (Vanoni2017Structurefunction).

## Function
MICAL1 is a multidomain flavoprotein monooxygenase involved in the regulation of oxidative stress and cytoskeletal dynamics in healthy human cells. It contains four conserved domains: an N-terminal flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) binding domain, a calponin homology (CH) domain, a Lin11, Isl-1 and Mec-3 (LIM) domain, and a C-terminal coiled-coil (CC) domain. The FAD domain is crucial for MICAL1's function, facilitating flavin mono-oxygenase activity and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Deng2016MICAL1).

In healthy cells, MICAL1 plays a role in regulating ROS levels, which is important for maintaining cellular homeostasis. It exhibits an autoinhibitory mechanism where the CC domain binds to the LIM domain, which can be relieved by interactions with proteins such as RAB1 and Plexin under specific cellular conditions (Deng2016MICAL1). MICAL1 also interacts with RAB35, a small GTPase involved in intracellular membrane trafficking and cell motility, suggesting a role in cell signaling and motility (Deng2016MICAL1).

MICAL1's activity in the cytoplasm and cell membrane influences processes like axon guidance and cell migration, highlighting its importance in cellular activities such as motility, morphology, and intracellular transport.

## Clinical Significance
MICAL1 has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression or mutations. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), MICAL1 is overexpressed compared to normal tissues, and higher expression levels are associated with poorer survival outcomes. Its expression correlates with immune cell infiltration, suggesting a role in immune regulation within the tumor microenvironment (Song2024MICAL1). In pancreatic cancer, MICAL1 is also overexpressed and promotes tumor proliferation, migration, and invasion by activating the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway. This overexpression is linked to more advanced disease stages and poorer overall survival in patients (Cai2022MICAL1).

Mutations in MICAL1 have been associated with autosomal dominant lateral temporal epilepsy (ADLTE). Specific mutations, such as a glycine to serine substitution and a frameshift mutation, increase enzymatic activity and are suggested to affect semaphorin signaling pathways, potentially leading to defects in axonal guidance during neuronal development (Olson2023MICAL1). Additionally, MICAL1 has been identified as having a homozygous variant near an intron-exon boundary in multiple autoimmune syndrome and Sjögren’s syndrome, which may impact splicing and contribute to disease pathogenesis (Johar2015Novel).

## Interactions
MICAL1 interacts with a variety of proteins, playing a significant role in cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular signaling. It binds to the cytoplasmic side of plexin receptors, which activates its oxidoreductase activity, crucial for semaphorin signaling and local actin cytoskeleton depolymerization during axon guidance (Vitali2016Properties; Vanoni2013MICAL). MICAL1 also interacts with Rab GTPases, such as Rab1, Rab10, and Rab35, through its C-terminal region, influencing vesicle trafficking and cytokinesis (Weide2003MICAL1; Frémont2017Emerging). The interaction with Rab proteins is nucleotide-dependent and involves specific binding sites with varying affinities (Frémont2017Emerging).

MICAL1's proline-rich region interacts with the SH3 domain of CasL, a docking protein involved in T cell receptor and β1 integrin-induced responses, which is important for cytoskeleton rearrangements (Suzuki2002MICAL; Vanoni2013MICAL). It also binds to vimentin, a component of intermediate filaments, suggesting a role in maintaining cytoskeletal integrity (Suzuki2002MICAL). Additionally, MICAL1 interacts with NDR kinases, acting as a negative regulator of MST-NDR signaling, which is involved in apoptosis regulation (Zhou2011MICAL1). These interactions highlight MICAL1's multifaceted role in cellular processes.
