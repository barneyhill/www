# ANP32E

## Overview
ANP32E is a gene that encodes the protein acidic nuclear phosphoprotein 32 family member E, which is a histone chaperone involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. The protein is characterized by its N-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain and a C-terminal low-complexity acidic region (LCAR), which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its localization within the cell (Yu2022Roles). ANP32E plays a critical role in the exchange of histone variant H2A.Z within chromatin, impacting gene expression and chromatin structure (Obri2014ANP32E). It is a component of the p400/Tip60 complex and is involved in the DNA damage response by facilitating chromatin remodeling at DNA double-strand breaks (GursoyYuzugullu2015Histone). Clinically, ANP32E is implicated in various cancers, where its overexpression is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Xiong2018ANP32E; Zhu2022ANP32E).

## Structure
ANP32E is a member of the ANP32 protein family, characterized by a conserved structure that includes an N-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain and a C-terminal low-complexity acidic region (LCAR) (Yu2022Roles). The LRR domain serves as a protein recognition motif, forming a 'whip-like' structure with a 'handle' and 'thong', and contains nuclear export signals (NESs) that influence the protein's cytoplasmic distribution (Yu2022Roles). The LCAR domain, composed mainly of acidic amino acids, contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS) that facilitates interaction with nuclear transport receptors (Yu2022Roles).

The interaction between ANP32E and the H2A.Z-H2B dimer involves a specific binding motif located at residues 214-224 of the LCAR domain, which is crucial for its role as a histone chaperone (Yu2022Roles; Mao2014Anp32e). This interaction leads to a conformational change in the H2A.Z αC helix, enhancing the recognition of H2A.Z by ANP32E (Mao2014Anp32e). The absence of a glycine residue in H2A.Z, which is present in H2A, allows the αC helix to extend and interact strongly with ANP32E, highlighting the importance of this structural feature (Mao2014Anp32e). 

ANP32E's structure is highly conserved across species, although specific details on its tertiary or quaternary structure, post-translational modifications, or splice variant isoforms are not provided in the available context (Reilly2010Generation; Yu2022Roles).

## Function
ANP32E is a histone chaperone that specifically interacts with the histone variant H2A.Z, playing a crucial role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. It is part of the p400/Tip60 complex, which is involved in the exchange of H2A for H2A.Z in chromatin, facilitating the removal of H2A.Z from nucleosomes (Obri2014ANP32E). ANP32E's interaction with H2A.Z is mediated by its C-terminal domain, known as the H2A.Z interacting domain (ZID), which is essential for binding to H2A.Z and influencing its distribution across the genome (Obri2014ANP32E).

ANP32E is active in the nucleus, where it co-localizes with H2A.Z, particularly around transcription start sites, affecting the distribution and occupancy of H2A.Z at these sites (Mao2014Anp32e). This activity is important for maintaining proper chromatin structure and function, impacting gene expression regulation (Mao2014Anp32e). ANP32E also inhibits protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which stabilizes H2A.Z by preventing its dephosphorylation and degradation, thus maintaining its nuclear presence (Shin2018Transcriptional). Despite its significant role in chromatin dynamics, ANP32E is not essential for viability, as mice lacking ANP32E do not exhibit notable phenotypes, suggesting redundancy with other chaperones (Obri2014ANP32E).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ANP32E gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), ANP32E is overexpressed and contributes to tumorigenesis by upregulating E2F1, a transcription factor involved in cell cycle progression. High levels of ANP32E are associated with shorter survival times, increased risk of disease relapse, and lung metastasis, making it an independent prognostic factor for TNBC (Xiong2018ANP32E). ANP32E overexpression also induces transcription-replication conflicts (TRCs) and genomic instability, which are linked to DNA damage and cancer progression. This overexpression creates a vulnerability to ATR inhibitors, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for treating ANP32E-overexpressing tumors (Lago2024ANP32E).

In gastric cancer, ANP32E is similarly upregulated and promotes tumor progression by enhancing cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis through the upregulation of NUF2, a component of the NDC80 kinetochore complex. This suggests that ANP32E functions as an oncogene in gastric cancer, making it a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Zhu2022ANP32E). Overall, ANP32E's role in promoting genomic instability and tumor progression underscores its clinical significance in cancer.

## Interactions
ANP32E interacts specifically with the H2A.Z/H2B dimer, a histone variant, and not with the conventional H2A/H2B dimer. This interaction is highly specific and stable, even in high salt concentrations, and is mediated by the C-terminal domain of ANP32E, particularly the H2A.Z interacting domain (ZID) (Obri2014ANP32E). The interaction involves a conformational change in the H2A.Z aC-helix, which is extended, allowing the ANP32E-ZID aN-helix to occupy the docking domain position, stabilizing the interaction through hydrophobic interactions and salt bridges (Obri2014ANP32E).

ANP32E is also a component of the p400/TIP60 complex, interacting with proteins such as p400, TRRAP, Brd8, TIP60, and ING3, but not with SRCAP. It interacts through its N-terminal domain with MRGBP, a component of the p400/TIP60 complex (Obri2014ANP32E). ANP32E's role in DNA damage response involves removing H2A.Z from nucleosomes at DNA double-strand breaks, facilitating chromatin remodeling and DNA repair (GursoyYuzugullu2015Histone). ANP32E also interacts with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), inhibiting its activity, which affects the stability and nuclear localization of H2A.Z (Shin2018Transcriptional).
