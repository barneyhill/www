# SPDYC

## Overview
SPDYC is a gene that encodes the protein speedy/RINGO cell cycle regulator family member C, which is part of the Speedy/Ringo family of proteins. This protein functions as a non-canonical activator of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), particularly Cdk2, distinguishing itself from traditional cyclins by activating Cdk2 without the need for phosphorylation on Thr-160 (Cheng2005Biochemical). The SPDYC-encoded protein forms a complex with Cdk2, facilitating cell cycle progression by phosphorylating non-canonical substrates, which is crucial for transitions such as the G2 to M phase and S-phase entry (Cheng2005Biochemical). SPDYC is primarily active in the nucleus of healthy human cells, where it plays a vital role in DNA replication and cell division (Cheng2005Biochemical). Beyond its fundamental biological functions, SPDYC has clinical significance, particularly in cancer prognosis, where its expression levels are linked to patient outcomes in various cancer types, including triple-negative breast cancer and colorectal cancer (Alsaleem2020A; Palaniappan2022COADREADx:).

## Function
SPDYC, also known as Speedy/Ringo C, is a member of the Speedy/Ringo family of proteins that function as non-canonical activators of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), particularly Cdk2. Unlike traditional cyclins, SPDYC can activate Cdk2 without the need for phosphorylation on Thr-160, which is typically required for Cdk2 activation by cyclins (Cheng2005Biochemical). This activation occurs independently of the Cyclin-Activating Kinase (CAK), indicating a unique mechanism of action (Cheng2005Biochemical).

SPDYC forms a complex with Cdk2, which exhibits broad substrate specificity, allowing it to phosphorylate non-canonical substrates such as Cdc25 phosphatases. This differs from the narrow consensus CDK phosphorylation motif seen with cyclins (Cheng2005Biochemical). The Cdk2-SPDYC complex is important for cell cycle progression, particularly in the G2 to M transition and S-phase entry, highlighting its role in regulating cell cycle checkpoints and progression (Cheng2005Biochemical).

In healthy human cells, SPDYC is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences processes like DNA replication and cell division, contributing to normal cellular proliferation and organismal development (Cheng2005Biochemical).

## Clinical Significance
SPDYC, a member of the speedy/RINGO family, plays a significant role in cancer prognosis, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). High expression levels of SPDYC are associated with poor patient outcomes, including shorter distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) in TNBC. This gene, along with ACSM4, forms a two-gene signature that serves as an independent prognostic marker for TNBC, with higher expression levels correlating with worse prognosis (Alsaleem2020A).

SPDYC is also involved in other cancer types. In colorectal cancer (CRC), SPDYC is identified as a potential target for drug discovery due to its role in metastatic transition, although no drugs currently modulate its expression (Palaniappan2022COADREADx:). In breast cancer, SPDYC is part of a risk score model, UULscore, which includes genes associated with ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like modifications. This model is used for molecular subtyping and predicting prognosis and treatment response (Zhou2023Identification; Zhou2024Identification).

The expression of SPDYC varies across different cancer types, with high expression linked to poor survival in some cancers, while in others, it is associated with longer survival (Wang2018Extensive). These findings highlight SPDYC's potential as a prognostic biomarker and a target for therapeutic interventions in various cancers.
