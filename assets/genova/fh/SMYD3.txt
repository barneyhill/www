# SMYD3

## Overview
SMYD3 is a gene that encodes the protein SET and MYND domain containing 3, which functions as a histone lysine methyltransferase. This protein is characterized by its catalytic SET domain, MYND domain, and a C-terminal domain, which together facilitate its role in chromatin modification and transcriptional regulation (Foreman2011Structural; Bernard2021SMYD3:). SMYD3 primarily methylates histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4), a modification associated with transcriptional activation, and is involved in various cellular processes, including muscle development and differentiation (Bernard2021SMYD3:). Beyond its physiological roles, SMYD3 is implicated in cancer progression, acting as an oncogene in several cancer types by promoting cell proliferation and metastasis (Zeng2023SMYD3; Li2020SMYD3). Its interactions with other proteins and involvement in signaling pathways underscore its potential as a therapeutic target in oncology (Fabini2019Unveiling; Zhang2019Is).

## Structure
SMYD3 is a protein characterized by several structural domains essential for its function as a histone methyltransferase. It contains a catalytic SET domain, which is split by a MYND domain, and a C-terminal domain (CTD) that forms a superhelical 9 α-helical bundle (Foreman2011Structural; Bernard2021SMYD3:). The SET domain includes an S-sequence for cofactor binding and protein-protein interactions, while the core SET domain serves as the primary catalytic site (Bernard2021SMYD3:). The MYND domain, a zinc-finger motif, facilitates protein-protein interactions and is crucial for catalytic activity and transcriptional specificity (Foreman2011Structural).

The protein's structure reveals a compact architecture with a 'split-SET' domain adopting a canonical SET domain fold, closely assembling with the MYND domain and CTD to create a confined binding pocket for histone substrates (Foreman2011Structural). SMYD3 can directly bind to DNA in vitro, a unique feature among the SMYD family (Bernard2021SMYD3:). The protein undergoes conformational changes between open and closed states, influenced by the presence of cofactors and substrates, which regulate its catalytic activity (Sun2021Mechanism). These structural features and dynamics are crucial for understanding SMYD3's role in transcriptional regulation and its potential as a target for cancer therapy.

## Function
SMYD3 is a histone lysine methyltransferase that primarily methylates histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4), a modification associated with transcriptional activation (Bernard2021SMYD3:). This protein is involved in chromatin modification, influencing gene expression by altering chromatin accessibility. SMYD3 can methylate both histone and non-histone substrates, which allows it to regulate various cellular processes (Bernard2021SMYD3:).

In healthy human cells, SMYD3 plays a critical role in muscle development, particularly in cardiac and skeletal muscle differentiation. It is highly expressed in fetal heart tissue and adult platelets and testis, but not in the liver, lung, or colon (Bernard2021SMYD3:). Knockdown studies in animal models have demonstrated its involvement in cardiac development and muscle differentiation, suggesting that SMYD3 influences muscle physiology through H3K4 methylation, which affects transcription factors like myogenin (Bernard2021SMYD3:).

SMYD3 is also part of the RNA polymerase II complex, contributing to transcriptional activation by methylating histone H3K4 and other residues, which facilitates the recruitment of transcription factors to gene promoters (Fabini2019Unveiling). Despite its significant role in cancer, SMYD3 appears to be non-essential for normal development, proliferation, and survival in healthy cells, as evidenced by knockout studies in mice (Peserico2015A).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SMYD3 gene have been implicated in various cancers, where it often acts as an oncogene. In gastric cancer, SMYD3 is overexpressed, correlating with aggressive clinical features and poor prognosis. It promotes cancer cell proliferation by repressing the expression of epithelial membrane protein 1 (EMP1) through an H4K20me3-dependent mechanism, which activates the Akt signaling pathway (Zeng2023SMYD3). In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), high SMYD3 expression is associated with poor overall survival and progression-free survival, serving as an independent prognostic marker (Tian2022SMYD3).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), SMYD3 overexpression is linked to aggressive tumor characteristics and reduced survival rates. It promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while its knockdown increases sensitivity to chemotherapy (Li2020SMYD3). In breast cancer, SMYD3 facilitates epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), contributing to metastasis, particularly in claudin-low subtypes (Fenizia2018SMYD3).

SMYD3 also plays a role in bladder cancer by participating in a positive feedback loop with IGF-1R, AKT, and E2F-1, which is crucial for tumor progression (Wang2020High). These findings highlight SMYD3 as a potential therapeutic target across multiple cancer types.

## Interactions
SMYD3, a histone methyltransferase, engages in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in transcriptional regulation and cancer progression. It forms complexes with proteins such as RNA polymerase II, facilitating gene expression in pro-oncogenic regions (Fabini2019Unveiling). SMYD3 interacts with proteins containing the PXLXP motif through its MYND domain, which is enriched in its interacting partners. This motif is present in proteins like PLCB3 and CAMK2B, suggesting roles in signaling pathways, including estrogen and WNT signaling (Zhang2019Is).

In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, SMYD3 is part of a protein-protein interaction network involving 23 identified interacting proteins, many of which are located in the nucleus. These interactions are essential for understanding SMYD3's role in transcription regulation and signal transduction (Liu2017Network). SMYD3 also interacts with nucleoside ligands such as SAM and SAH, with varying affinities depending on the temperature, influencing its methylation activity on lysine residues of peptides derived from proteins like MAP3K2 and histones H3 and H4 (Fabini2019Unveiling). These interactions highlight SMYD3's involvement in complex regulatory networks that impact cancer cell proliferation and metastasis.
