# SLC26A11

## Overview
SLC26A11 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 26 member 11, which is part of the SLC26 family of anion exchangers. This protein is primarily localized in lysosomes and functions as a pH-dependent chloride/sulfate exchanger or passive chloride conductor, playing a crucial role in maintaining lysosomal ion homeostasis (BungertPlümke2024Oligomerization). Unlike other members of the SLC26 family, which are typically found on the plasma membrane, SLC26A11 is unique in its lysosomal localization and forms stable homodimers without heterodimerizing with other SLC26 isoforms (BungertPlümke2024Oligomerization). The protein is prominently expressed in the brain, particularly in Purkinje cells, and is involved in regulating intracellular pH and ion homeostasis, which are essential for normal neuronal function (Rahmati2013Slc26a11). SLC26A11 has also been implicated in chronic myeloid leukemia through a novel gene fusion, although the clinical implications of this fusion are not fully understood (ZHOU2012Identification).

## Structure
The SLC26A11 protein is a member of the SLC26 family of anion exchangers, characterized by a unique lysosomal localization, unlike other family members that typically localize to the cell surface (BungertPlümke2024Oligomerization). It is primarily found in lysosomal structures and functions as a pH-dependent Cl^-/SO4^2- exchanger or passive Cl^- conductor, contributing to lysosomal ion homeostasis (BungertPlümke2024Oligomerization). SLC26A11 forms stable homodimers and does not heterodimerize with other SLC26 isoforms, maintaining its subcellular localization to lysosomes (BungertPlümke2024Oligomerization).

The protein's structure includes a hydrophobic core that spans the plasma membrane 10 to 14 times, with a transmembrane domain modeled with 11 transmembrane domains and an extracellular NH2-terminus (Mount2004The; Stewart2011SLC26). Unlike other SLC26 proteins, SLC26A11 lacks a class I PDZ interaction motif in its C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (Mount2004The). The STAS domain, which is present in SLC26 proteins, is shorter in SLC26A11 compared to other family members (Mount2004The). The protein can undergo complex glycosylation, affecting its molecular weight (BungertPlümke2024Oligomerization).

## Function
SLC26A11, also known as the kidney brain anion transporter (KBAT), is a member of the solute carrier family 26 and functions primarily as a chloride channel. It is prominently expressed in the brain, particularly in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, and is also found in the hippocampus, olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, and subcortical structures (Rahmati2013Slc26a11). SLC26A11 is a constitutively active chloride channel, meaning it operates under baseline conditions without the need for activation by cAMP or intracellular calcium, distinguishing it from other chloride channels like CFTR (Rahmati2013Slc26a11).

In healthy human cells, SLC26A11 is involved in regulating intracellular pH and maintaining ion homeostasis. It colocalizes with vacuolar (V) H+-ATPase in Purkinje cells, suggesting a role in modulating acid translocation and establishing an electrochemical gradient of protons, which is crucial for neurotransmitter accumulation in synaptic vesicles (Rahmati2013Slc26a11). The protein is also localized in lysosomes, where it functions as a pH-dependent Cl-/SO4 2- exchanger and/or as a passive Cl- conductor, playing a key role in maintaining lysosomal ion homeostasis (BungertPlümke2024Oligomerization). This function is essential for normal lysosomal activity, as lysosomes metabolize sulfur-containing compounds to sulfate (SO4 2-) (BungertPlümke2024Oligomerization).

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the SLC26A11 gene, also known as the kidney brain anion transporter (KBAT), is not fully understood, but it has been implicated in various conditions due to its role in anion transport. In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), a novel gene fusion involving SLC26A11 and RNF213 has been identified. This fusion results in altered expression of SLC26A11, potentially affecting its normal function in sulfate transport. The fusion transcript weakens the sulfate transport function of SLC26A11, although its transport activity regulation and NTP binding functions remain intact (ZHOU2012Identification). The clinical implications of this fusion in CML are not fully understood, and further research is needed to determine its impact on the disease (ZHOU2012Identification).

In other contexts, SLC26A11 has been associated with chloride transport in the brain, particularly in Purkinje cells, where it may influence neuronal excitability and neurotransmitter accumulation. Disruptions in chloride transport can affect motor learning and memory consolidation, suggesting potential neurological implications (Rahmati2013Slc26a11). However, no specific pathogenic mutations in SLC26A11 have been reported (Li2023SLC26).

## Interactions
SLC26A11, a member of the solute carrier family 26, primarily forms homodimers and is localized in lysosomes. Studies have shown that SLC26A11 does not form heterodimers with other SLC26 isoforms, such as SLC26A4/pendrin, SLC26A7, SLC26A1, SLC26A2, SLC26A6, and SLC26A9. This was demonstrated using native gel electrophoresis and confocal imaging, which revealed low Manders coefficients, indicating a lack of significant interaction with these isoforms (BungertPlümke2024Oligomerization).

The protein's unique lysosomal localization suggests a specialized role distinct from other SLC26 family members, which are typically found on the plasma membrane. Despite its potential as an anion channel, the specific molecular interactions and physiological roles of SLC26A11 remain largely enigmatic. It is suggested to function as a pH-dependent Cl-/SO4 2- exchanger or passive Cl- conductor, contributing to lysosomal ion homeostasis (BungertPlümke2024Oligomerization).

In the context of chronic myeloid leukemia, a novel gene fusion involving SLC26A11 and RNF213 has been identified. This fusion may alter the function of SLC26A11, although specific protein interactions resulting from this fusion have not been detailed (ZHOU2012Identification).
