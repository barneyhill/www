# TAGLN2

## Overview
TAGLN2 is a gene that encodes the protein transgelin 2, which is a member of the calponin family of actin-binding proteins. Transgelin 2 is primarily involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, playing a crucial role in maintaining cell shape, motility, and stability. It is predominantly expressed in lymphocytes and certain non-smooth muscle cells, where it stabilizes cortical F-actin and enhances phagocytic function in macrophages (Kim2018TAGLN2). The protein is characterized by distinct domains, including an N-terminal calponin homology domain and an actin-binding motif, which facilitate its interaction with actin filaments (Saito2021Determining). Transgelin 2's ability to inhibit the Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin branching is essential for the development of cellular structures like filopodia, which are important for cell motility and immune function (Kim2018TAGLN2). Additionally, TAGLN2 has been implicated in various cancers, where its expression levels can influence tumor progression and metastasis, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Pan2023An; Shi2020Transgelin2).

## Structure
Transgelin-2 (TAGLN2) is a protein encoded by the TAGLN2 gene, characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function. The primary structure of TAGLN2 includes an N-terminal calponin homology (CH) domain located between amino acid residues 25 and 136, an actin-binding motif (AB domain) between residues 153 and 160, and a C-terminal calponin-repeat (CR) domain between residues 174 and 197 (Saito2021Determining). These domains are crucial for its interaction with actin, with the CH and AB domains being necessary for binding to F-actin, while the CR domain is not essential for this interaction (Saito2021Determining).

The tertiary structure of TAGLN2 allows it to act as a molecular staple, binding to actin subdomains SD1 and SD3, which stabilizes the actin structure and inhibits Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin branching (Kim2018TAGLN2). TAGLN2's interaction with actin is facilitated by its positively charged actin-binding sites, which may interact with actin similarly to poly-cations (Kim2018TAGLN2). The protein can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may affect its functional properties. TAGLN2 is also known to undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions.

## Function
TAGLN2, or transgelin 2, is a protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which is crucial for maintaining cell shape, motility, and stability. It is predominantly expressed in lymphocytes and certain non-smooth muscle cells, where it stabilizes cortical F-actin, aiding in the maintenance of the immunological synapse and enhancing phagocytic function in macrophages (Kim2018TAGLN2). TAGLN2 is involved in actin polymerization, particularly under low ionic conditions, and inhibits the Arp2/3 complex from binding to actin filaments, preventing branched actin nucleation (Kim2018TAGLN2). This dual functionality is essential for the development of filopodia at the edges of lamellipodia, which are important for cell motility and immune cell function (Kim2018TAGLN2).

In macrophages, TAGLN2 is crucial for phagocytosis, as it facilitates actin polymerization and rearrangement, which are necessary for forming phagocytic cups and membrane ruffles (Kim2017An). TAGLN2 enhances phagocytosis through the PI3K/AKT and ERK signaling pathways, which are critical for actin dynamics during bacterial engulfment (Kim2017An). Its role in actin dynamics is also highlighted by its ability to increase F-actin content, which is essential for T-cell activation and adhesion (Jeon2018Actin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TAGLN2 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TAGLN2 is significantly upregulated, with its high expression correlating with shorter overall and disease-free survival, suggesting its role as a prognostic marker. Silencing TAGLN2 in HCC cell lines reduces cell viability, proliferation, and migration, indicating its involvement in cancer progression through the NF-kB signaling pathway (Shi2020Transgelin2).

In breast cancer, TAGLN2 acts as a metastasis suppressor. Its downregulation is associated with increased metastatic potential, as evidenced by enhanced cell invasion and lung metastasis in experimental models. This effect is mediated through increased reactive oxygen species production and activation of the NF-kB pathway, promoting the expression of metastasis-associated genes (Yang2019Downregulation).

TAGLN2 is also identified as an oncogene in a pan-cancer analysis, with its overexpression linked to poor prognosis in multiple cancer types. It is associated with immune regulation, tumor microenvironment remodeling, and resistance to certain anti-tumor drugs, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Pan2023An).

## Interactions
TAGLN2 (transgelin 2) is known to interact with several proteins, influencing various cellular processes. One significant interaction is with Annexin A2 (ANXA2), which plays a role in colorectal cancer (CRC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In CRC, TAGLN2 promotes STAT3 signaling through its interaction with ANXA2, enhancing cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. This interaction is crucial for the activation of STAT3 signaling, which is involved in tumorigenesis (Zhao2021TAGLN2). In HCC, TAGLN2 interacts with ANXA2 to regulate the NF-kB signaling pathway, promoting cancer proliferation and metastasis. This interaction involves the regulation of ANXA2 phosphorylation, which subsequently induces NF-kB p65 phosphorylation, contributing to the abnormal proliferation of HCC cells (Shi2020Transgelin2).

TAGLN2 also interacts with Peroxiredoxin 1 (PrdX1) in breast cancer, where its downregulation leads to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and activation of the NF-kB signaling pathway. This interaction affects mitochondrial distribution and is associated with increased cellular migration and invasion (Yang2019Downregulation). These interactions highlight TAGLN2's role in modulating key signaling pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target in various cancers.
