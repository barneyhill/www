# RCOR3

## Overview
RCOR3 (REST corepressor 3) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in transcriptional repression, primarily through its role in chromatin remodeling and histone modification. The protein, also named REST corepressor 3, is a component of the LSD1/CoREST/HDACs transcriptional repressor complex, which is crucial for modulating gene expression, particularly in neuronal cells (Zheng2023Comprehensive; Maksour2020More). RCOR3 is characterized by its interaction with lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) and contains several functional domains, including ELM2 and SANT domains, which facilitate its binding to nucleosomal DNA and other proteins (OlivaresCosta2023Evolution; Olivares2021Evolution). The protein plays a significant role in maintaining cellular identity and function by regulating genes critical for neural development and differentiation. Additionally, RCOR3 has been implicated in various cancers and may serve as a prognostic biomarker, highlighting its importance in both normal cellular processes and disease states (Zheng2023Comprehensive).

## Structure
RCOR3 (REST corepressor 3) is a protein characterized by its involvement in transcriptional repression, primarily through its interaction with lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1). The protein structure of RCOR3 includes several functional domains, notably the ELM2 domain and two SANT domains, which are crucial for its interaction with nucleosomal DNA and other proteins (OlivaresCosta2023Evolution; Olivares2021Evolution). The linker domain of RCOR3 is particularly important for binding to LSD1, although it shows lower evolutionary conservation compared to other domains (OlivaresCosta2023Evolution; Olivares2021Evolution).

The RCOR3 protein also contains an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) in the pre-linker area, which may contribute to its functional versatility despite low conservation (OlivaresCosta2023Evolution). The interaction between RCOR3 and LSD1 involves conserved amino acids within the linker domain, with 26.6% of these residues being highly conserved and 62.5% facing LSD1, indicating a well-defined interaction interface (Olivares2021Evolution).

RCOR3 is known to mediate competitive inhibition of LSD1-dependent histone demethylation, suggesting a regulatory role in epigenetic modifications (OlivaresCosta2023Evolution). The protein's structure and interactions are essential for its function in various biological processes, including myeloid cell differentiation (OlivaresCosta2023Evolution).

## Function
RCOR3 (REST corepressor 3) is a protein that plays a significant role in transcriptional repression, primarily through its involvement in chromatin remodeling and histone modification. It functions as part of the LSD1/CoREST/HDACs transcriptional repressor complex, which interacts with the REST (RE1-silencing transcription factor) to modulate gene expression, particularly in neuronal cells (Zheng2023Comprehensive; Maksour2020More). This complex is crucial for maintaining cellular identity and function by regulating genes critical for neural development and differentiation.

In healthy human cells, RCOR3 is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the regulation of gene expression through its role in chromatin modification. It competes with LSD1 in hematopoietic cells, indicating its involvement in hematopoietic processes (Zheng2023Comprehensive). RCOR3's activity is associated with maintaining pluripotency, as evidenced by its role in the upregulation of the pluripotency regulator NANOG in chicken primordial germ cells (Maksour2020More).

While RCOR3's specific functions in healthy human cells are not fully elucidated, its involvement in these molecular processes suggests a critical role in maintaining the balance of gene expression necessary for normal cellular and organismal function.

## Clinical Significance
RCOR3 (REST corepressor 3) has been implicated in various cancers and may serve as a prognostic biomarker. Increased expression of RCOR3 is associated with poor progression-free survival in adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) and rectal adenocarcinoma (READ), and it correlates with disease-specific survival in ACC, breast cancer (BRCA), and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (Zheng2023Comprehensive). RCOR3 expression is also linked to tumor mutation burden, showing positive correlations in ACC, acute myeloid leukemia (LAML), low-grade glioma (LGG), and skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), but negative correlations in bladder cancer (BLCA), BRCA, ovarian cancer (OV), and sarcoma (SARC) (Zheng2023Comprehensive).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), RCOR3 expression is significantly correlated with clinicopathological parameters, although it does not show significant differences across tumor stages (Zheng2023Comprehensive). Genetic alterations in RCOR3, particularly amplifications, are relatively frequent in cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL), BRCA, and liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) (Zheng2023Comprehensive). These alterations are associated with better overall survival and disease-specific survival in certain contexts, although they do not significantly affect progression-free survival or disease-free survival (Zheng2023Comprehensive).

RCOR3 is also involved in neurodevelopmental processes, and its dysfunction is hypothesized to contribute to neurodegenerative diseases, although specific conditions directly associated with RCOR3 mutations or expression changes are not detailed (Maksour2020More).

## Interactions
RCOR3 (REST corepressor 3) is involved in several protein interactions, primarily as part of the LSD1/CoREST/HDAC1/2 epigenetic complex. This complex plays a significant role in transcriptional repression by modifying chromatin structure. RCOR3 interacts with lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), a key enzyme that removes transcriptionally permissive histone modifications, thereby repressing gene expression (OlivaresCosta2023Evolution). The interaction between RCOR3 and LSD1 is crucial for the function and stability of the LSD1 complex, with the RCOR proteins having a characteristic structure that includes two SANT domains facilitating interaction with nucleosomal DNA (OlivaresCosta2023Evolution).

RCOR3 is also known to mediate competitive inhibition of LSD1-dependent histone demethylation, although it has been less studied compared to its paralogs RCOR1 and RCOR2 (OlivaresCosta2023Evolution). In the context of cancer, RCOR3 has been identified in regulatory networks, such as its interaction with the transcription factor YY1, which is part of the RCORs-TFs regulatory network (Zheng2023Comprehensive). These interactions suggest that RCOR3 may have roles in modulating gene expression and influencing cellular processes through its participation in these complexes.
