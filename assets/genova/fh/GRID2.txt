# GRID2

## Overview
The GRID2 gene encodes the glutamate ionotropic receptor delta type subunit 2 (GluD2), a receptor primarily expressed in the cerebellum, particularly in Purkinje cells. As a member of the ionotropic glutamate receptor family, GluD2 is distinct in that it does not bind glutamate or form active ion channels, but instead plays a pivotal role in synaptic organization and plasticity. The receptor is involved in the formation and maintenance of synapses through its interaction with cerebellin-1 and neurexins, forming a tripartite complex essential for synaptic function. Structurally, GluD2 is characterized by its unique non-swapped architecture, which allows for increased conformational flexibility. This receptor is crucial for processes such as long-term depression at cerebellar synapses, influencing motor coordination and balance. Mutations in the GRID2 gene are linked to various neurological disorders, including cerebellar ataxia and spinocerebellar ataxia type 18, highlighting its clinical significance (Panda2020GRID2; Coutelier2015GRID2; Van2015Earlyonset).

## Structure
The GRID2 gene encodes the GluD2 receptor, a member of the ionotropic glutamate receptor family, characterized by a unique structural architecture. The primary structure of the GluD2 receptor includes specific domains such as the amino-terminal domain (ATD), ligand-binding domain (LBD), and transmembrane domain (TMD) (Burada2020The). The ATD forms dimers with a clamshell-like architecture, featuring two lobes, R1 and R2, and is involved in trans-synaptic interactions (Burada2020Emerging). The LBD has a venus flytrap-like structure with two subdomains, D1 and D2, and undergoes conformational changes upon ligand binding (Burada2021Structural). 

The tertiary structure of GluD2 is notable for its non-swapped architecture between the ATD and LBD layers, which is distinct from other ionotropic glutamate receptors (Chin2021Structural). This non-swapped arrangement allows for increased conformational freedom and a splayed conformation of the receptor (Burada2021Structural). The quaternary structure involves the formation of a tetrameric assembly with an asymmetric arrangement of its extracellular domains (Burada2020The).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a role in the receptor's synaptic trafficking and function (Burada2020Emerging). The GluD2 receptor is also involved in forming a tripartite complex with cerebellin1 and neurexins, crucial for synapse formation and maintenance (Burada2020Emerging).

## Function
The GRID2 gene encodes the glutamate receptor delta 2 (GluRD2) protein, which is primarily expressed in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. This protein is part of the ionotropic glutamate receptor family, which includes NMDA, AMPA, and kainate receptors, although GluRD2 itself does not bind glutamate or form active ion channels (Coutelier2015GRID2). Instead, it plays a crucial role in synapse organization and modulation, particularly at the synapses between parallel fibers and Purkinje cells. GluRD2 forms a complex with cerebellin-1, acting as a synapse organizer and is involved in long-term depression at these synapses, potentially through the regulation of AMPA receptor endocytosis (Coutelier2015GRID2).

In the retina, GRID2 is expressed in photoreceptor inner segments, the outer plexiform layer, and the ganglion cell layer, suggesting a role in retinal function and synaptic transmission (Van2015Earlyonset). The protein is involved in the function of neurons within the OFF pathway, which includes horizontal cells, OFF bipolar cells, amacrine cells, and ganglion cells, indicating its involvement in neurotransmission processes (Van2015Earlyonset).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GRID2 gene are associated with several neurological disorders, primarily characterized by cerebellar ataxia. Early-onset autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia (ARCA) and spinocerebellar ataxia type 18 (SCA18) are notable conditions linked to GRID2 mutations. These disorders often present with symptoms such as nystagmus, hypotonia, developmental delays, and cerebellar atrophy (Panda2020GRID2; Van2015Earlyonset). 

GRID2 mutations can lead to a range of phenotypes, including spastic paraplegia, retinal dystrophy, and cognitive impairments like early-onset dementia (Panda2020GRID2). The gene's mutations are typically loss-of-function, resulting in disrupted synaptic transmission in the cerebellum, which affects motor coordination and balance (Ceylan2020Autosomal). 

The GRID2 gene is also implicated in eye movement disorders and intellectual disabilities, with some cases showing gender differences in symptom severity, potentially due to modifier genes on the X chromosome (Panda2020GRID2). The phenotypic spectrum of GRID2 mutations is broad, necessitating careful genotype-phenotype correlation for accurate diagnosis (Coutelier2015GRID2).

## Interactions
The GRID2 gene encodes the glutamate receptor delta 2 (GluD2), which is primarily expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells and plays a crucial role in synaptic organization and plasticity. GluD2 interacts with cerebellin-1 (Cbln1), a protein secreted by granule cells, forming a complex with presynaptic neurexin (Nrxn) on parallel fiber terminals. This neurexin-Cbln1-GluD2 complex is essential for synapse formation and maintenance, facilitating the accumulation of proteins at both presynaptic and postsynaptic sites (Coutelier2015GRID2; Hansen2021Structure).

The C-terminal domain of GluD2 interacts with intracellular scaffolding proteins such as shank-2 and PSD-93/95, which organize other postsynaptic molecules like homer-3 and AMPA receptors (Matsuda2010Cbln1). These interactions are crucial for synaptic clustering and the regulation of synaptic plasticity. The amino-terminal domain (ATD) of GluD2 is necessary for its interaction with Cbln1 and the formation of complexes with β-neurexin-1, which is vital for the long-term depression of cerebellar parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses (Grigorenko2022Neurodevelopmental).

D-serine has been identified as an endogenous agonist for GluD2, binding to its agonist binding domain (ABD) and mediating metabotropic signaling, although no ion channel activity has been detected in response to this binding (Hansen2021Structure).
