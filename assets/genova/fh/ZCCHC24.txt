# ZCCHC24

## Overview
ZCCHC24 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger CCHC-type containing 24 protein, which is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs. These motifs are typically involved in binding nucleic acids and are crucial for various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and RNA processing. The protein encoded by ZCCHC24 is implicated in several biological pathways and has been associated with significant clinical relevance in cancer research. Notably, ZCCHC24 has been identified as a potential biomarker for thyroid carcinoma due to its high diagnostic efficiency and correlation with immune cell infiltration (Yin2023Differential). Additionally, genomic alterations involving ZCCHC24 have been linked to early onset colorectal cancer, suggesting its role in cancer pathogenesis (Berg2010Distinct).

## Clinical Significance
ZCCHC24 has been identified as having significant clinical relevance in thyroid carcinoma (THCA). The gene exhibits high diagnostic efficiency, with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.90, indicating its potential as a biomarker for THCA diagnosis (Yin2023Differential). Immunohistochemistry results show that ZCCHC24 expression is higher in THCA patients compared to normal controls, suggesting its involvement in the disease's pathology (Yin2023Differential). Additionally, ZCCHC24 is positively correlated with various immune cells, including B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, and CD8+ T cells, highlighting its role in tumor immunity (Yin2023Differential).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), particularly early onset cases, the ZCCHC24 gene is located in a genomic region (10q22.3) that is frequently gained in early onset patients, suggesting a potential role in the disease's development (Berg2010Distinct). This gain was observed in 8 of 23 early onset CRC patients, but not in late onset cases, indicating a possible association with early onset CRC susceptibility (Berg2010Distinct). These findings suggest that alterations in ZCCHC24 expression or genomic location may contribute to the pathogenesis of certain cancers.
