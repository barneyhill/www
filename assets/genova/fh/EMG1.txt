# EMG1

## Overview
EMG1 is a human gene that encodes the EMG1 N1-specific pseudouridine methyltransferase, a protein crucial for ribosome biogenesis. This protein belongs to the SPOUT-class of methyltransferases and is involved in the site-specific N1-methylation of pseudouridine in eukaryotic 18S rRNA, a modification essential for the proper assembly and function of ribosomes. The EMG1 protein forms a homodimer and is characterized by a unique structural motif that facilitates its interaction with RNA and other components of the ribosome assembly machinery. Mutations in the EMG1 gene, such as the D86G mutation, are linked to Bowen-Conradi syndrome, a severe developmental disorder. The protein's activity is vital for normal cell proliferation and development, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular growth and division (Jedrzejewski2023Nucleolar; Armistead2014Mutation; Meyer2010The).

## Structure
The EMG1 protein, also known as Nucleolar Essential Protein 1 (Nep1), is a SPOUT-class methyltransferase involved in ribosome biogenesis. It is responsible for the site-specific N1-methylation of pseudouridine in eukaryotic 18S rRNA. The protein exhibits a typical SPOUT quaternary and tertiary structure, forming a homodimer with a 3_1 knot in the active site, which is crucial for its function. This knot is involved in binding both the nucleic acid substrate and the methyl donor, as well as facilitating interactions between the two subunits of the homodimeric protein (Jedrzejewski2023Nucleolar).

The structure of EMG1 includes a dimer with a fold similar to other SPOUT-class RNA methyltransferases. It contains two insertions relative to the core fold, including a large, surface-exposed loop rich in basic amino acids and a β-α-β element with an antiparallel orientation of the two β-strands. The α-helix of the β-α-β element and its preceding loop contain three highly conserved arginine residues, which are important for RNA binding (Wurm2010The).

Mutations in EMG1, such as the D86G mutation, are associated with Bowen-Conradi syndrome, affecting the protein's function and localization, leading to impaired ribosome biogenesis (Meyer2010The).

## Function
The human gene EMG1, also known as EMG1 N1-specific pseudouridine methyltransferase, plays a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis, specifically in the assembly of the small ribosomal subunit and the maturation of pre-18S rRNA. EMG1 functions as a pseudouridine-N1-specific methyltransferase, catalyzing the methylation of pseudouridine in rRNA, a modification essential for the proper folding, stability, and function of rRNAs (Wurm2010The; Sondalle2014Human). This methylation process is part of a unique hypermodification pathway that is critical for efficient 18S rRNA maturation and ribosome formation (Meyer2010The).

In healthy human cells, EMG1 is localized in the nucleolus, where it interacts with other components of the small subunit processome, a large ribonucleoprotein complex required for ribosome assembly (Armistead2014Mutation). The protein's activity is essential for normal cell proliferation and development, as demonstrated by its ability to complement yeast Emg1 deficiency, indicating conserved functions across species (Armistead2014Mutation). The proper function of EMG1 is vital for maintaining ribosome biogenesis and ensuring adequate protein synthesis, which is crucial for cellular growth and division (Meyer2010The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EMG1 gene are primarily associated with Bowen-Conradi syndrome (BCS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder predominantly affecting the Hutterite population. The syndrome is caused by a specific missense mutation, D86G, in the EMG1 gene, which leads to severe developmental abnormalities, including pre- and post-natal growth retardation, microcephaly, psychomotor delay, and multiple joint abnormalities. Most affected individuals do not survive beyond the first year of life (Freed2010When; Armistead2009Mutation).

The D86G mutation in EMG1 disrupts the protein's stability and solubility, causing it to aggregate and degrade, which results in a partial deficiency of EMG1 protein. This deficiency impairs ribosome biogenesis, particularly affecting the maturation of the 40S ribosomal subunit, which is crucial for cell proliferation during fetal development (Armistead2009Mutation). Despite normal EMG1 mRNA levels, the mutation leads to decreased protein levels, suggesting post-translational effects (Sondalle2014Human).

The mutation also increases the dimerization propensity of EMG1, potentially preventing its proper localization to the nucleolus, further disrupting ribosome assembly and contributing to the clinical manifestations of BCS (Sondalle2014Human; Meyer2010The).

## Interactions
EMG1, also known as N1-specific pseudouridine methyltransferase, is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, primarily within the context of ribosome biogenesis. EMG1 interacts with NOP14, a nucleolar protein, which is essential for its nuclear localization and function in the maturation of 18S rRNA and the production of the 40S ribosomal subunit (Leulliot2007The; Liu2001Novel). This interaction is part of a larger nucleolar subcomplex that includes NOP14, NOC4L, and UTP14A, which is required for recruitment to nucleoli (Li2020EMG1).

EMG1 also binds directly to RNA, with a preference for 18S rRNA, and this interaction is crucial for its role in ribosome assembly. The protein forms homodimers, which enhances its RNA-binding capability, although no methylation activity has been detected in vitro (Leulliot2007The). The interaction between EMG1 and NOP14 is conserved across species, as demonstrated by the interaction between their mammalian orthologues (Liu2001Novel).

In the context of melanoma cells, EMG1 and NOP14 regulate growth, migration, and invasion via the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, highlighting their role beyond ribosome biogenesis (Li2020EMG1).
