# KANSL1L

## Overview
KANSL1L is a human gene that encodes the protein KAT8 regulatory NSL complex subunit 1 like. This protein is a component of the non-specific lethal (NSL) complex, which is involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. The NSL complex plays a crucial role in the acetylation of histone H4, a process that is essential for the regulation of gene expression. KAT8 regulatory NSL complex subunit 1 like is categorized as a chromatin-associated protein, and its function is critical for maintaining proper cellular processes and gene expression patterns. Mutations or dysregulation of KANSL1L have been implicated in various developmental disorders and diseases, highlighting its importance in human health (Qiu2020aarFDC).
