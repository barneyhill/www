# FIGLA

## Overview
FIGLA, or folliculogenesis specific basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, is a gene that encodes a protein crucial for ovarian development and function. The FIGLA protein is a transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in the formation and maintenance of primordial follicles in the human ovary by regulating the expression of oocyte-specific genes, including those encoding zona pellucida proteins. It is specifically expressed in germ cells and is essential for the survival of oocytes and the formation of primordial follicles. The protein functions by forming a complex with another bHLH protein, E12, which is necessary for its DNA binding and transcriptional regulation activities. FIGLA also plays a role in repressing testis-specific genes, thereby maintaining sexually dimorphic gene expression in postnatal oocytes. Mutations in the FIGLA gene have been linked to primary ovarian insufficiency and premature ovarian failure, highlighting its critical role in reproductive health (Hu2010FIGLA; Lim2012Transcription; Bayne2004Increased).

## Function
The FIGLA gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor that is crucial for the formation and maintenance of primordial follicles in the human ovary. FIGLA is specifically expressed in germ cells and plays a significant role in ovarian development by regulating the expression of oocyte-specific genes, including those encoding zona pellucida proteins (Zp1, Zp2, and Zp3) (Joshi2007Ovarian; Lim2012Transcription). 

During fetal development, FIGLA expression increases significantly during mid-gestation, particularly between 14 and 19 weeks, coinciding with the formation of primordial follicles (Bayne2004Increased). FIGLA functions by forming a complex with another bHLH protein, E12, which is necessary for its DNA binding and transcriptional regulation activities (Bayne2004Increased). This interaction is crucial for the survival of oocytes and the formation of primordial follicles (Bayne2004Increased).

In addition to activating oocyte-specific genes, FIGLA also represses testis-specific genes, maintaining sexually dimorphic gene expression in postnatal oocytes (Hu2010FIGLA). This dual role is essential for normal reproductive function, as FIGLA's absence leads to the failure of primordial follicle formation and sterility in female mice (Hu2010FIGLA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FIGLA gene are associated with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) and premature ovarian failure (POF), conditions characterized by the early depletion of ovarian follicles leading to infertility. Specific mutations, such as the A41V variant, have been identified as loss-of-function mutations that disrupt transcriptional activity, contributing to POI (Bouilly2016Identification). Other mutations, including a 22 base pair deletion (c.15-36 del, p.G6fsX66) and a c.419-421 delACA variant (p.140 delN), have been linked to POF by affecting FIGLA's ability to dimerize and bind to DNA, which is crucial for its function as a transcription factor (Zhao2008Transcription).

In some cases, FIGLA mutations result in a truncated protein that cannot perform its normal functions, as seen with the c.2 T > C (p.Met1Thr) mutation, which impairs protein synthesis and leads to POI with short stature (Chen2018Consanguineous; Yuan2018Bi‐allelic). These genetic alterations highlight the critical role of FIGLA in ovarian development and function, with disruptions leading to significant reproductive health issues. The gene's involvement in regulating oocyte-specific genes underscores its importance in maintaining fertility (França2019Genetics).

## Interactions
The FIGLA protein, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, is known to interact with the E12 protein to form a heterodimer. This complex is crucial for binding to the E-box of the promoters of zona pellucida genes, such as ZP1, ZP2, and ZP3, which are essential for oocyte development and primordial follicle formation (Bayne2004Increased). The interaction between FIGLA and E12 is necessary for the activation of these genes, and the presence of E12 in the complex has been confirmed through electrophoretic mobility shift assays and supershift assays using an anti-E2a antibody (Bayne2004Increased).

FIGLA can bind to the E-box independently, but its functionality without E12 is not fully understood (Bayne2004Increased). The bHLH domain of FIGLA is critical for these interactions, allowing dimerization and DNA binding (Bayne2004Increased). FIGLA's interaction with E12 is conserved across species, as demonstrated in both human and mouse studies (Bayne2004Increased). Additionally, FIGLA may interact with other proteins or factors specific to different stages of follicle formation, influencing its regulatory role in gene expression (Bayne2004Increased).
