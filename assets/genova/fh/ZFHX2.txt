# ZFHX2

## Overview
ZFHX2 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger homeobox 2 protein, a transcription factor involved in the regulation of gene expression, particularly within sensory neurons. The protein is characterized by its 17 zinc finger motifs, a PRDM9-like domain, and three homeodomains, which are structural features typical of transcriptional regulators (Habib2017A). These domains facilitate DNA binding and transcriptional regulation, playing a crucial role in modulating pain perception and potentially influencing neuropsychiatric processes. ZFHX2 is expressed in various brain regions, including the thalamus and hypothalamus, and is notably present in dorsal root ganglia neurons, indicating its involvement in sensory neuron function (Habib2017A). Mutations in ZFHX2 have been linked to Marsili syndrome, a rare pain insensitivity disorder, and have also been associated with behavioral abnormalities in animal models, suggesting its broader role in emotional regulation and potential implications in psychiatric disorders (Komine2012Behavioral).

## Structure
The ZFHX2 gene encodes a large protein consisting of 2572 amino acids, characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function as a transcriptional regulator. The protein includes 17 zinc finger motifs, which are known for their role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation (Habib2017A). It also contains a central PRDM9-like domain, which, despite lacking the active site tyrosines necessary for methyltransferase activity, may still possess nucleosome binding properties (Habib2017A). The protein features three homeodomains, which are typically 60 amino acids long and are crucial for DNA binding (Habib2017A). A point mutation in the second homeodomain, changing an arginine to a lysine, has been linked to a novel human pain insensitivity disorder, suggesting the importance of this domain in maintaining proper DNA binding affinity and transcriptional specificity (Habib2017A).

The protein's structure is significant in the context of its role in pain sensitivity and potential involvement in neuropsychiatric disorders, as indicated by its expression in specific brain regions and its impact on behavior in animal models (Komine2012Behavioral).

## Function
The ZFHX2 gene encodes a transcription factor involved in regulating gene expression, particularly in sensory neurons. It is expressed in various regions of the brain, including the thalamus, hypothalamus, midbrain, and pontine areas, and continues to be expressed in the adult brain (Habib2017A). In healthy human cells, ZFHX2 likely plays a role in regulating genes involved in peripheral pain mechanisms, as its mutation leads to altered expression of such genes (Habib2017A). The protein contains 17 zinc finger motifs, a PRDM9-like domain, and three homeodomains, which are common features of transcriptional regulators, suggesting its involvement in gene expression regulation (Habib2017A).

ZFHX2 is highly expressed in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons, particularly in the peripherin-positive population, indicating its involvement in sensory neuron function (Habib2017A). The gene's function in healthy cells likely involves transcriptional regulation, given its structural features, although the specific pathways or processes it regulates are not detailed (Habib2017A). The presence of AG-rich DNA sequence motifs in genes deregulated by mutant ZFHX2 suggests its role in modulating pain perception and possibly influencing other sensory processes (Habib2017A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZFHX2 gene have been linked to a rare human pain insensitivity disorder known as Marsili syndrome. This condition is characterized by a reduced sensitivity to pain, including painless bone fractures and insensitivity to burning stimuli. The disorder is caused by a point mutation that alters a conserved arginine to lysine within the second homeodomain of the ZFHX2 protein, affecting its role as a transcriptional regulator (Habib2017A). This mutation leads to altered pain perception without causing a loss of nociceptive neurons, suggesting that the pain insensitivity is due to changes in gene regulation rather than neuron loss (Habib2017A).

In addition to pain insensitivity, ZFHX2 mutations have been associated with behavioral abnormalities in mice, such as hyperactivity, enhanced depression-like behaviors, and altered anxiety-like phenotypes. These findings suggest that ZFHX2 may play a role in emotional regulation through its effects on monoaminergic neurons, potentially linking it to psychiatric disorders (Komine2012Behavioral). The gene's expression in the brain and its involvement in neural development highlight its significance in both pain perception and emotional behavior (Komine2012Behavioral).
