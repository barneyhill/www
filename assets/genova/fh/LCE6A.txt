# LCE6A

## Overview
LCE6A, or late cornified envelope 6A, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the formation and maintenance of the skin's protective barrier. This gene is part of the LCE gene family, which is located within the epidermal differentiation complex on chromosome 1q21. The protein encoded by LCE6A is integral to the cornified envelope, a structure that provides mechanical strength and water resistance to the outermost layer of the skin. LCE6A is particularly responsive to environmental stressors, such as cold and dry conditions, where its expression is upregulated to enhance skin barrier function and prevent dehydration. While the precise molecular functions of the LCE6A protein remain to be fully elucidated, it is implicated in the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, which is crucial for skin integrity and defense against external threats (BarbollatBoutrand2017Repeated; Mathyer2021Selective; Bergboer2014Analysis).

## Function
LCE6A (late cornified envelope 6A) is a member of the LCE gene family, which plays a crucial role in the epidermal differentiation process and skin barrier function. The LCE6A gene is part of the epidermal differentiation complex located on chromosome 1q21, which is involved in the formation of the cornified envelope, a critical component of the skin's protective barrier (BarbollatBoutrand2017Repeated; Bergboer2014Analysis).

In response to environmental stress, such as cold-dry conditions, LCE6A expression is significantly upregulated, suggesting its involvement in enhancing the skin barrier to prevent dehydration (BarbollatBoutrand2017Repeated). The protein encoded by LCE6A is thought to be cross-linked to the cornified envelope, contributing to the structural integrity of the outermost layer of the skin (Bergboer2014Analysis).

Although the specific molecular functions of LCE6A in healthy human cells are not fully understood, it is believed to participate in the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, which is essential for maintaining skin integrity and preventing water loss and pathogen entry (BarbollatBoutrand2017Repeated). The gene's expression is regulated by enhancers, such as the 923 enhancer, which modulates its activity in response to environmental changes (Mathyer2021Selective).
