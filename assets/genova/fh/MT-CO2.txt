# MT-CO2

## Overview
The MT-CO2 gene is a mitochondrial gene that encodes the protein cytochrome c oxidase subunit II, a vital component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This protein is a part of Complex IV, also known as cytochrome c oxidase, which plays a critical role in cellular respiration by facilitating the reduction of oxygen to water. As a transmembrane protein, cytochrome c oxidase subunit II is integral to the process of oxidative phosphorylation, where it aids in the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to the oxygen molecule, contributing to ATP production (MkaouarRebai2013A; Chen2009Regulation). Mutations in the MT-CO2 gene can lead to various mitochondrial disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular energy metabolism and overall physiological function (Wong2001Severe; Zierz2019A).

## Structure
The MT-CO2 gene encodes cytochrome c oxidase subunit II, a crucial component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This protein is part of the cytochrome c oxidase complex (Complex IV), which is essential for the reduction of oxygen to water, a key step in cellular respiration (MkaouarRebai2013A; Heidari2020Novel). The primary structure of MT-CO2 consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by mitochondrial DNA. 

The secondary structure of MT-CO2 includes hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains, with the protein being largely hydrophobic. It contains two hydrophilic domains that may play a role in its function and interaction with other subunits (Tabebi2017Whole). 

In terms of tertiary structure, the MT-CO2 protein is involved in forming a trimeric complex with other subunits, such as MT-CO1 and MT-CO3, within the cytochrome c oxidase complex. This interaction is crucial for the proper function of the enzyme complex, as demonstrated by structural modeling studies (Pei2021Human). 

Mutations in MT-CO2, such as m.8241T>G and m.8249G>A, can lead to structural changes that may impact the protein's function and are associated with various diseases, including mitochondrial myopathy and maternally inherited diabetes and deafness (Tabebi2017Whole; MkaouarRebai2013A).

## Function
The MT-CO2 gene encodes cytochrome c oxidase subunit II, a critical component of Complex IV in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This protein is integral to the process of oxidative phosphorylation, where it facilitates the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to the oxygen molecule, a step essential for ATP production in cells (MkaouarRebai2013A; Chen2009Regulation). MT-CO2 contains a binuclear copper A center that plays a pivotal role in electron transfer, moving electrons from cytochrome c to the bimetallic center of the catalytic subunit I (MkaouarRebai2013A). This electron transfer is coupled with proton pumping across the inner mitochondrial membrane, contributing to the proton motive force necessary for ATP synthesis (signes2019identification).

The MT-CO2 protein is active in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it forms part of the core of cytochrome c oxidase, along with subunits MT-CO1 and MT-CO3 (signes2019identification). Proper assembly and function of this complex are crucial for maintaining cellular energy metabolism and supporting various physiological processes in healthy human cells (signes2019identification). Defects in MT-CO2 can lead to mitochondrial complex IV deficiency, affecting energy production and potentially leading to a range of clinical symptoms (MkaouarRebai2013A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MT-CO2 gene, which encodes a subunit of cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, are associated with a range of mitochondrial disorders. These mutations can lead to severe lactic acidosis, as seen in cases where a novel frame-shift mutation results in a truncated COXII protein, impairing mitochondrial respiratory function and causing conditions such as severe lactic acidosis, apnea, and bradycardia in infants (Wong2001Severe). 

In adults, MT-CO2 mutations have been linked to late-onset cerebellar ataxia and neuropathy. For instance, the m.8163A>G variant causes isolated complex IV deficiency, leading to progressive cerebellar syndrome and tremor (Zierz2019A). Another case involved a frameshift mutation, m.8156delG, associated with symptoms like cognitive decline, epilepsy, and lactic acidosis (Kytövuori2017Case).

MT-CO2 variants are also implicated in cancer. In MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP) patients, MT-CO2 mutations are linked to genome instability and tumorigenesis, with specific variants like m.7763G>A associated with KRAS mutations and colorectal cancer progression (Errichiello2015Mitochondrial). These findings highlight the gene's role in both mitochondrial dysfunction and cancer development.

## Interactions
MT-CO2, a subunit of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase), plays a crucial role in electron transport. It interacts with several other subunits and assembly factors to ensure proper function and assembly of the complex. MT-CO2 is stabilized by the assembly factor COX20, which aids in the insertion of its N-terminal transmembrane helix into the inner mitochondrial membrane. COX18 facilitates the insertion of the C-terminus, which contains a copper-binding site known as the Cu A center (Mukherjee2020Molecular).

MT-CO2 also interacts with TMEM177, which stabilizes it in a COX20-dependent manner. The subunit has a β barrel extramembrane domain anchored by two transmembrane helices that bind to MT-CO1. The Cu A center is located within a loop region, and copper delivery to this site is mediated by COX17, SCO1, and SCO2, with SCO2 also performing a thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase function. COA6 and COX16 are involved in Cu A center biogenesis, interacting with MT-CO2 and other assembly factors (Mukherjee2020Molecular).

MT-CO2 later combines with COX6C, COX7B, COX7C, and COX8A subunits to complete its module assembly. The vertebrate-specific COX assembly factor MR-1S interacts with the MT-CO2 module via PET100 and PET117, though the precise roles of these proteins remain unclear (Mukherjee2020Molecular).
