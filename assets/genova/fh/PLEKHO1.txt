# PLEKHO1

## Overview
PLEKHO1, also known as CKIP-1, is a gene that encodes the pleckstrin homology domain-containing protein O1, a scaffold protein involved in various cellular processes. This protein plays a critical role in cell morphology, differentiation, apoptosis, and signaling pathways, particularly the PI3K/Akt pathway, where it functions as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting Akt kinase activity (Ma2016The). CKIP-1 is also implicated in bone health, where it negatively regulates bone formation by promoting the ubiquitination and degradation of Smad1, thus affecting Smad-dependent BMP signaling (Liu2017Increased). Additionally, CKIP-1 is involved in macrophage proliferation and polarization during inflammatory responses (Fu2019Physiological). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane, where it recruits other proteins such as CK2 and PAK1, facilitating phosphorylation events essential for cellular homeostasis (Olsten2004The). Given its involvement in multiple signaling pathways, PLEKHO1 is considered a potential therapeutic target for various conditions, including cancer and osteoporosis.

## Structure


## Function
PLEKHO1, also known as CKIP-1, is a protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including cell morphology, differentiation, and apoptosis. It interacts with a wide range of proteins such as CPα, PAK1, Arp2/3, HDAC1, and Akt, influencing actin dynamics and cell signaling pathways (Fu2019Physiological). CKIP-1 is involved in the regulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, acting as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting Akt kinase activity, which is crucial for cell survival and proliferation (Ma2016The).

In bone health, CKIP-1 negatively regulates bone formation by promoting the ubiquitination and degradation of Smad1, thereby suppressing Smad-dependent BMP signaling pathways. This regulation is particularly relevant in the context of aging, where increased expression of CKIP-1 in osteoblasts is associated with reduced bone formation (Liu2017Increased). CKIP-1 also plays a role in macrophage proliferation and polarization during inflammatory responses, affecting macrophage apoptosis and pro-inflammatory gene activation (Fu2019Physiological).

CKIP-1 is active in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane, where it recruits CK2 and PAK1, facilitating specific phosphorylation events that are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and tissue integrity (Olsten2004The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PLEKHO1 gene have been implicated in several age-related and pathological conditions. In the context of bone health, increased expression of PLEKHO1 in osteoblasts is associated with reduced Smad-dependent BMP signaling, which is crucial for bone formation. This suppression leads to decreased bone formation during aging, contributing to conditions such as osteoporosis. Targeting PLEKHO1 expression in osteoblasts has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy to enhance bone formation and mitigate age-related bone loss (Liu2017Increased).

In gastric cancer, PLEKHO1 acts as a tumor suppressor. The pseudogene-derived long noncoding RNA DUXAP8 is upregulated in gastric cancer tissues and promotes cancer cell proliferation and migration by epigenetically silencing PLEKHO1 expression. This silencing occurs through the interaction of DUXAP8 with the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), leading to the downregulation of PLEKHO1 and subsequent activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which is associated with tumor progression. The findings suggest that targeting the interaction between DUXAP8 and PLEKHO1 could be a promising approach for gastric cancer diagnosis and treatment (Ma2016The).

## Interactions
PLEKHO1, also known as CKIP-1, is a scaffold protein that mediates interactions with a variety of proteins, playing a significant role in multiple cellular processes. It interacts with casein kinase 2 alpha (CK2α), facilitating the recruitment of CK2 to the plasma membrane, which may promote the phosphorylation of plasma membrane substrates (Nie2013CKIP1:). PLEKHO1 also interacts with the α-subunit of the actin capping protein (CPα), inhibiting its capping activity and accelerating F-actin depolymerization, which induces morphological changes in cells (Nie2013CKIP1:). 

In the context of bone formation, PLEKHO1 is involved in the ubiquitination of Smad1, thereby suppressing Smad-dependent BMP signaling, which is crucial for bone formation (Liu2017Increased). It interacts with Smurf1, an E3 ligase, enhancing its activity and affecting the stability of substrates like Smad1/5 (Nie2013CKIP1:). 

PLEKHO1 also plays a role in cell migration, particularly in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), by interacting with CK2α in response to EGF signaling, which activates P21 protein activated kinase 1 (PAK1) (sadras2017role). These interactions highlight PLEKHO1's involvement in various signaling pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target.
