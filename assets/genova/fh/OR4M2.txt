# OR4M2

## Overview
The OR4M2 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily M member 2, a protein that belongs to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein is primarily involved in the olfactory system, where it functions as a receptor for odorant molecules, facilitating the sense of smell through signal transduction pathways (Flegel2016Characterization). While predominantly expressed in the olfactory epithelium, OR4M2 has also been detected in other tissues, such as human spermatozoa, although its role outside the olfactory system is not fully understood (Flegel2016Characterization). Additionally, the gene has been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, indicating potential functions beyond olfactory perception (Chen2015Concurrent).

## Function
The OR4M2 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules. These receptors are primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where they bind specific odorants, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell (Flegel2016Characterization). The OR4M2 protein is involved in olfactory signal transduction, a process that is essential for the sense of smell, and is characterized by the activation of downstream signaling pathways upon binding to odorant molecules (Deng2019AmpliSeq).

In addition to its role in olfaction, OR4M2 has been implicated in other biological processes. For instance, its expression has been observed in human spermatozoa, although it may not be expressed as a functional olfactory receptor protein in this context (Flegel2016Characterization). The gene has also been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, suggesting a potential role beyond olfactory perception (Chen2015Concurrent). However, the specific functions of OR4M2 in these contexts remain to be fully elucidated.
