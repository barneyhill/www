# NAT9

## Overview
NAT9 is a gene that encodes the protein N-acetyltransferase 9 (putative), which is part of the acetyltransferase enzyme family. These enzymes are involved in the transfer of acetyl groups to various substrates, a process that is crucial for regulating protein function and gene expression. The NAT9 protein is implicated in several cellular signaling pathways, including interactions with mitogen-activated protein kinase 6 (MAPK6) and components of the Hippo signaling pathway, suggesting its role in cell growth, stress responses, and tissue regulation (Mok2022Modulation; Deshpande2023NAcetyltransferase). The conservation of NAT9 function across species, such as its homolog in Drosophila, underscores its potential significance in human health and disease, including conditions like Alzheimer's disease and cancer (Mok2022Modulation).

## Interactions
N-acetyltransferase 9 (NAT9) is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. One notable interaction is with mitogen-activated protein kinase 6 (MAPK6), which plays a role in regulating Activator Protein-1 (AP1) activity. This interaction suggests that NAT9 may influence pathways related to cell growth and stress responses (Deshpande2023NAcetyltransferase).

In Drosophila, the homolog of NAT9, known as Mnat9, has been shown to interact with components of the Hippo signaling pathway, which is crucial for regulating organ size and tumorigenesis. Mnat9 can co-immunoprecipitate with Mer, a component of the Hippo pathway, indicating a direct interaction and suggesting that Mnat9 may be part of a protein complex with Mer. This interaction appears to modulate the Hippo pathway, potentially antagonizing its function and affecting tissue growth (Mok2022Modulation).

These interactions highlight the potential role of NAT9 in modulating key signaling pathways, which could have implications for understanding its function in human diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and cancer. The conservation of function between Drosophila Mnat9 and human NAT9 suggests that these interactions may be relevant in human biology as well (Deshpande2023NAcetyltransferase).
