# GCH1

## Overview
The GCH1 gene encodes the enzyme GTP cyclohydrolase 1, a key player in the biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), an essential cofactor for various enzymatic processes. GTP cyclohydrolase 1 is a decameric enzyme, categorized as a hydrolase, and is involved in the first and rate-limiting step of BH4 production. This enzyme is crucial for the synthesis of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine, as well as for the regulation of nitric oxide production in the vascular system (THÖNY2000Tetrahydrobiopterin; Bendall2014Tetrahydrobiopterin). Mutations in the GCH1 gene are linked to several neurological disorders, including Dopa-responsive dystonia and Parkinson's disease, underscoring its importance in maintaining neurological and vascular health (Varghaei2021GCH1; Mencacci2014Parkinson’s). The enzyme's activity is regulated through complex interactions with other proteins, such as the GTP cyclohydrolase I feedback regulatory protein (GFRP), and is subject to modulation by various factors, including cytokines and phenylalanine (Yoneyama1998Decameric; THÖNY2000Tetrahydrobiopterin).

## Structure
The GCH1 protein, encoded by the human GCH1 gene, is a homodecamer composed of ten identical subunits, each consisting of 221 amino acids (Hussein2012Investigating). The protein forms a toroidal structure with dimensions of approximately 115 Å by 115 Å by 387 Å, organized as two pentameric rings sandwiched together (Hussein2012Investigating). Each subunit of GCH1 folds into an alpha-beta configuration, with a predominantly helical N-terminal region (Hussein2012Investigating).

The active sites of GCH1 are located at the interface of three subunits, two from one pentamer and one from the other, with a total of ten equivalent active sites selective for GTP (Hussein2012Investigating). Zinc is essential for the enzyme's activity, associating with specific amino acid residues, and mutations in these residues can lead to a catalytically inactive enzyme (Hussein2012Investigating).

The N-terminal region of GCH1, although initially thought to be non-essential, plays a role in binding to the feedback regulatory protein GFRP, with the first 42 amino acids being crucial for this interaction (Hussein2012Investigating). The truncated form of GCH1, which lacks the first 42-45 amino acids, shows increased activity compared to the native form, suggesting an auto-inhibitory role of the N-terminal region (Hussein2012Investigating).

## Function
The GCH1 gene encodes the enzyme GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH), which catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) (THÖNY2000Tetrahydrobiopterin). BH4 is a critical cofactor for several enzymes, including nitric oxide synthases (NOSs) and aromatic amino acid hydroxylases, which are involved in the production of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine (THÖNY2000Tetrahydrobiopterin). In the vascular system, BH4 is essential for the production of nitric oxide (NO) by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), a process crucial for maintaining vascular tone and blood pressure regulation (Bendall2014Tetrahydrobiopterin).

GCH1 activity ensures adequate levels of BH4, supporting normal endothelial function by facilitating NO production, which acts as a vasodilator to regulate blood flow and pressure (Bendall2014Tetrahydrobiopterin). The enzyme is active in the cytoplasm and is regulated at both transcriptional and post-translational levels, with its activity influenced by factors such as cytokines and phenylalanine (THÖNY2000Tetrahydrobiopterin). In healthy human cells, GCH1 plays a vital role in neurotransmission and vascular health, with its dysfunction linked to various cardiovascular diseases (Bendall2014Tetrahydrobiopterin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GCH1 gene are associated with several neurological disorders. The most well-known condition linked to GCH1 mutations is Dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by childhood-onset dystonia, diurnal fluctuations, and a significant response to levodopa treatment (Varghaei2021GCH1; Bandmann1998Dopa‐responsive). GCH1 mutations can also lead to Parkinson's disease, with studies indicating that both rare heterozygous mutations and common variants in the GCH1 locus increase the risk of developing this condition (Xu2017Rare; Mencacci2014Parkinson’s).

In addition to DRD and Parkinson's disease, GCH1 mutations have been implicated in hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), a group of inherited neurodegenerative disorders characterized by lower limb spasticity and weakness (Varghaei2021GCH1). Rare bi-allelic mutations in GCH1 can cause tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4)-deficient hyperphenylalaninemia B, which presents with severe developmental delay, muscular hypotonia, hypertonia, seizures, and other neurological symptoms (Varghaei2021GCH1).

The clinical presentation of GCH1-related disorders can vary significantly, influenced by genetic variants, environmental factors, and epigenetic modifications (Varghaei2021GCH1). The phenotypic spectrum ranges from mild movement disorders to severe neurodevelopmental conditions, highlighting the gene's critical role in neurological health.

## Interactions
GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCH1) is known to interact with several proteins, forming both stable and transient complexes. A key interaction is with the GTP cyclohydrolase I feedback regulatory protein (GFRP), where GCH1 forms a complex with two pentameric GFRP molecules. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of GCH1 activity and is influenced by the presence of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) and GTP, as well as phenylalanine. The complex formation is dose-dependent and involves GCH1 being sandwiched between two GFRP pentamers (Yoneyama1998Decameric).

GCH1 also interacts with heat shock proteins, specifically Hsp90 and Hsp70. The interaction with Hsp90 is disrupted by asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), which enhances the interaction with Hsp70 and leads to GCH1 degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This process is facilitated by the E3 ligase CHIP, which decreases GCH1 protein concentrations (Sun2011CTerminus).

In addition, GCH1 interacts with various proteins in a tissue-specific manner. For instance, it interacts with eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit I (EIF3I) across multiple organs, suggesting a ubiquitous role for EIF3I in GCH1 regulation (Du2012The).
