# RBM33

## Overview
RBM33 is a gene that encodes the RNA binding motif protein 33, a crucial RNA binding protein involved in the nuclear export of transcripts containing GC-rich elements. This protein is categorized as an RNA binding protein and is essential for the proper localization and abundance of RNA within the cell, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and genomic stability. RNA binding motif protein 33 primarily interacts with exons of both protein-coding and noncoding RNAs, facilitating the assembly of export-competent ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) through its interaction with the TREX component UAP56 and the export receptor NXF1. This interaction is vital for the efficient cytoplasmic trafficking of specific RNAs, such as the long non-coding RNA NORAD. The RBM33 gene has also been implicated in various clinical contexts, including cervical cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Thomas2022RBM33; Wagner2021Clinicogenetic; Ding2021Circular).

## Function
RBM33 (RNA binding motif protein 33) is an RNA binding protein that plays a crucial role in the nuclear export of transcripts containing GC-rich elements. It primarily binds to exons of both protein-coding and noncoding RNAs, with a preference for fully processed, export-competent transcripts. RBM33 facilitates the assembly of export-competent ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) by interacting with the TREX component UAP56 and the export receptor NXF1, promoting the nuclear export of these transcripts (Thomas2022RBM33).

RBM33 is essential for the export of specific RNAs, such as the long non-coding RNA NORAD, which relies on GC-rich sequences at its 5' end for export. The protein's binding sites are enriched in GC content, and its binding is necessary for the efficient cytoplasmic trafficking of its target transcripts (Thomas2022RBM33). In RBM33-deficient cells, transcripts with high GC content, including those encoding transmembrane proteins, exhibit impaired nuclear export, leading to their nuclear retention (Thomas2022RBM33).

RBM33's function is critical for maintaining proper RNA localization and abundance, which is important for cellular homeostasis and genomic stability (Thomas2022RBM33).

## Clinical Significance
RBM33 has been implicated in the progression of cervical cancer (CC) through its role in modulating the miR-758-3p/PUM2 axis. The circular RNA circRBM33, derived from the RBM33 gene, is upregulated in CC tissues and is associated with poor prognosis, larger tumor size, advanced FIGO stage, and lymph node metastases. Knockdown of circRBM33 reduces cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and glycolytic activity in CC cells, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for prognosis and a target for therapeutic intervention (Ding2021Circular).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, a heterozygous in-frame insertion in the RBM33 gene was identified in a family with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and/or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Although the clinical significance of this mutation is not fully established due to the lack of segregation analyses, RBM33 was prioritized for study because of its prion-like domain, which is a characteristic shared by proteins associated with ALS and FTD (Wagner2021Clinicogenetic).

RBM33 also plays a role in the nuclear export of transcripts containing GC-rich elements, including the long non-coding RNA NORAD. Disruption of RBM33 function leads to nuclear retention and degradation of these transcripts, which may contribute to genomic instability (Thomas2022RBM33).

## Interactions
RBM33 is an RNA binding protein that plays a significant role in the nuclear export of transcripts containing GC-rich elements. It primarily binds within exons of both protein-coding and noncoding RNAs, with a preference for fully processed, export-competent transcripts. RBM33 interacts with components of the TREX-NXF1 nuclear export machinery, specifically the TREX component UAP56 and the export receptor NXF1, facilitating the assembly of export-competent ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) (Thomas2022RBM33). This interaction is crucial for the efficient cytoplasmic trafficking of transcripts like NORAD, which are enriched in GC content (Thomas2022RBM33).

RBM33 predominantly localizes to the nucleus and shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm. It interacts with core TREX components such as THOC1-3, THOC5-7, UAP56, ALYREF, and NXF1, although ALYREF is not required for NORAD export (Thomas2022RBM33). Binding assays have shown interactions between RBM33 and UAP56 and NXF1, but not with THO complex subunits (Thomas2022RBM33). RBM33's binding to GC-rich sequences is a key feature of its function, and it may also have a preference for specific structural features such as G quadruplexes (Thomas2022RBM33).
