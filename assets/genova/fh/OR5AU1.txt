# OR5AU1

## Overview
OR5AU1 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 5 subfamily AU member 1, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as an olfactory receptor, playing a pivotal role in the detection of odor molecules and the initiation of signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. Expressed predominantly in the olfactory epithelium, OR5AU1 contributes to the vast diversity of olfactory detection by binding specific odorants. While its primary role is associated with olfactory perception, there is evidence suggesting that olfactory receptors, including OR5AU1, may have additional functions in non-olfactory tissues, although these roles are not yet fully understood (Walter2010Expression; Alonso2008Overdominance).

## Function
OR5AU1 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily involved in detecting odor molecules and initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. OR5AU1 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, contributing to the diversity of olfactory detection (Walter2010Expression; Alonso2008Overdominance).

In healthy human cells, olfactory receptors like OR5AU1 play a crucial role in the molecular processes of olfaction. They are involved in the initial steps of odorant recognition and signal transduction, which are essential for the sense of smell. The binding of odorant molecules to these receptors activates a G-protein-mediated signaling cascade, leading to neuronal responses that are interpreted by the brain as distinct smells (Alonso2008Overdominance).

While the primary function of OR5AU1 is related to olfactory perception, olfactory receptors have also been found to be expressed in other tissues, suggesting potential roles beyond olfaction. However, specific functions of OR5AU1 in non-olfactory tissues remain to be fully elucidated (Walter2010Expression).
