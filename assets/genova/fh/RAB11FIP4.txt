# RAB11FIP4

## Overview
RAB11FIP4 is a gene that encodes the protein Rab11 family interacting protein 4, which is a member of the Rab11-family of interacting proteins involved in endosomal recycling. This protein plays a crucial role in intracellular trafficking, particularly in the recycling of membrane proteins and vesicular transport. It is characterized by its unique structure, which includes an EF-hand calcium-binding motif and a Rab-binding domain, facilitating its interaction with the small GTPase Rab11. The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm, especially around endosomes and the Golgi apparatus, where it regulates vesicle trafficking. RAB11FIP4 is implicated in various cellular processes, including cytokinesis and receptor recycling, and has been associated with cancer progression, making it a potential therapeutic target (Wang2017Hypoxiainduced; Osaki2021RBD11; Muto2006Mouse).

## Structure
RAB11FIP4 encodes a protein that is part of the Rab11-family interacting proteins, which are involved in endosomal recycling. The protein consists of 635 amino acids and shares 91% identity with its human counterpart, Rab11-FIP4 (Muto2006Mouse). The structure of RAB11FIP4 includes several key domains: a single EF-hand motif near the N-terminus, which is a calcium-binding domain, and a Rab-binding domain (RBD) near the C-terminus (Wang2017Hypoxiainduced; Muto2006Mouse). The protein also features a coiled-coil structure and two leucine-zipper-like motifs within the C-terminal half, which are conserved across species such as humans and zebrafish (Muto2006Mouse).

The EF-hand motif is crucial for the protein's function in retinal development, suggesting a role in calcium-mediated interactions (Muto2006Mouse). The C-terminal RBD is involved in binding to Rab11, although the protein can function independently of Rab11 in certain contexts (Muto2006Mouse). RAB11FIP4 may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which could influence its activity and interactions (Wang2017Hypoxiainduced). Splice variant isoforms, such as Rab11-FIP4A and Rab11-FIP4B, result in structural diversity, with the latter lacking the N-terminal EF-hand motif (Muto2006Mouse).

## Function
Rab11-family interacting protein 4 (RAB11FIP4) is involved in intracellular trafficking, particularly in the recycling of membrane proteins and vesicular transport. It is a downstream effector of the small GTPase Rab11, playing a significant role in membrane trafficking associated with cytokinesis. RAB11FIP4 is distinct from other Rab11-FIPs due to its N-terminus possessing an EF-hand calcium-binding motif, which is crucial for its function (He2016High).

In healthy human cells, RAB11FIP4 is involved in the recycling of cargo to the membrane surface and the transport of membrane to the cleavage furrow or midbody during cell division. It links Rab11 to molecular motor proteins, facilitating the movement of vesicles within the cell (He2016High). RAB11FIP4 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, especially around endosomes and the Golgi apparatus, where it regulates the trafficking of vesicles (Wang2017Hypoxiainduced).

The protein's activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis, influencing processes like cytokinesis and receptor recycling, which are vital for cell division and signaling. Its interaction with Rab11 is GTP-dependent, highlighting its role in dynamic cellular processes (Osaki2021RBD11).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RAB11FIP4 gene have been implicated in several types of cancer. In colorectal cancer (CRC), RAB11FIP4 is significantly overexpressed, correlating with poor prognosis and increased tumor aggressiveness. This overexpression promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, contributing to tumor metastasis. RAB11FIP4 interacts with the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R), enhancing the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT, which are pathways involved in cancer progression (Wang2017Hypoxiainduced).

In pancreatic cancer, high levels of RAB11FIP4 expression are associated with larger tumor size, higher histological grade, and advanced disease stage. This overexpression is linked to shorter overall survival, indicating its role as a tumor promoter. Knockout studies in pancreatic cancer cell lines have shown that reducing RAB11FIP4 expression inhibits cell growth, invasion, and metastasis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (He2016High).

In glioblastoma, RAB11FIP4 is downregulated, and its expression levels have been associated with diagnostic efficiency. The gene's expression and methylation status are considered potential biomarkers for this aggressive brain tumor (Rahmati2021Integrative).

## Interactions
Rab11-FIP4 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in intracellular trafficking and cancer progression. It forms a complex with Rab11 and the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R), which is crucial for its function in colorectal cancer (CRC). This interaction enhances the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and AKT serine/threonine kinase, promoting CRC cell migration and invasion (Wang2017Hypoxiainduced). Rab11-FIP4 is also involved in the endosomal recycling pathway, binding with high affinity to Rab11a, Rab11b, and Rab25, which are part of the Rab11 subfamily of GTPases (O’Sullivan2020The). 

Rab11-FIP4 selectively interacts with the GTP-bound form of Rab11, indicating its role in vesicle trafficking and cellular organization (Wang2017Hypoxiainduced). It is suggested that Rab11-FIP4 may protect IGF1R from degradation or promote its recycling, further implicating its role in cancer cell behavior (Wang2017Hypoxiainduced). These interactions highlight Rab11-FIP4's potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment due to its involvement in critical signaling pathways and cellular processes.
