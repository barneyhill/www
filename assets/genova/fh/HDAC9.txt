# HDAC9

## Overview
Histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9) is a gene that encodes the protein histone deacetylase 9, a member of the class IIa histone deacetylases. This protein is involved in the removal of acetyl groups from histone proteins, a process that leads to chromatin condensation and transcriptional repression, thereby playing a critical role in regulating gene expression. HDAC9 is characterized by a conserved C-terminal catalytic domain and an N-terminal regulatory domain, although its catalytic activity is relatively weak compared to other HDACs (Milazzo2020Histone; Yang2021Histone). Despite this, HDAC9 can form complexes with other histone deacetylases, such as HDAC3, to exert its repressive functions (Yang2021Histone). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and development, and is known to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm, which influences its regulatory capacity across different physiological systems (Ma2021MicroRNA3835p). HDAC9's role extends to several biological contexts, including bone and adipogenic differentiation, and it is implicated in various diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Chatterjee2013HDAC9; Zhang2020Impaired).

## Structure
HDAC9 is a member of the class IIa histone deacetylases, characterized by a highly conserved C-terminal catalytic domain and an N-terminal regulatory domain. The full-length HDAC9 protein consists of 1,069 amino acids, encoded by exons 2-26, with exon 1 being untranslated (Yang2021Histone). The catalytic domain of HDAC9 has weak deacetylase activity due to a Y-H substitution in the catalytic site, which is a common feature among class IIa HDACs (Milazzo2020Histone). Despite this, HDAC9 can repress transcription by forming complexes with other HDACs, such as HDAC3 (Milazzo2020Histone; Yang2021Histone).

HDAC9 undergoes various post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, sumoylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation, which regulate its activity and interactions (Yang2021Histone). Phosphorylation affects its subcellular localization, with specific sites like Ser220, Ser451, and Ser611 involved in interactions with 14-3-3 proteins, influencing nuclear import and export (Yang2021Histone).

HDAC9 exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, including MITR, which lacks the catalytic domain but still represses transcription by interacting with MEF2 (Milazzo2020Histone; Yang2021Histone). Other isoforms include HDAC9a, which has a 132-amino acid deletion at the C-terminus (Yang2021Histone).

## Function
HDAC9 (histone deacetylase 9) is a class IIa histone deacetylase involved in the removal of acetyl groups from histone proteins, leading to chromatin condensation and transcriptional repression. This activity plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression and is involved in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and development. HDAC9 is known to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm, influencing its regulatory capacity across different physiological systems (Ma2021MicroRNA3835p).

In the context of bone biology, HDAC9 negatively regulates osteogenic differentiation by repressing the transcription of osteogenic genes such as RUNX2, osteocalcin, and Smad4. This repression is achieved through its deacetylase activity, which affects chromatin structure and gene expression (Ma2021MicroRNA3835p). HDAC9's role in bone formation is further highlighted by its involvement in autophagy regulation in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs), where it binds to the promoters of autophagy-related genes, affecting their expression and consequently influencing stem cell differentiation (Zhang2020Impaired).

HDAC9 also plays a role in adipogenic differentiation, acting as a negative regulator. Its downregulation is necessary for the activation of adipogenic differentiation in preadipocytes, and its expression is influenced by dietary conditions, such as a high-fat diet (Chatterjee2013HDAC9).

## Clinical Significance
HDAC9 is implicated in several diseases due to its role in gene expression regulation. Alterations in HDAC9 expression are linked to cardiac hypertrophy. Overexpression of HDAC9 in cardiomyocytes suppresses MEF2-dependent transcription, reducing cardiac hypertrophy, while disruption of the HDAC9 gene in mice leads to increased MEF2 activity and exaggerated cardiac hypertrophy, suggesting HDAC9 acts as an endogenous inhibitor of this condition (Yang2005Class; Hagelkruys2011The). HDAC9 is also associated with coronary heart disease and T-cell lymphoma due to its ability to convert MEF2s from transcriptional activators into repressors (Yang2005Class).

In cancer, HDAC9 expression changes are linked to aggressive growth and therapeutic resistance, particularly in urothelial bladder cancer (Ramaiah2021Epigenetic). HDAC9 is involved in tumorigenesis through interactions with Runx transcription factors, and its expression levels decrease as tumors progress, making it a potential indicator of cancer prognosis (Yang2005Class). HDAC9 is also implicated in Peter's anomaly, a condition affecting the eyes (Yang2005Class). These associations highlight the clinical significance of HDAC9 in various diseases, emphasizing its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
HDAC9, a member of the class IIa histone deacetylases, participates in various protein interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. It interacts with MEF2 (myocyte enhancer factors 2) and can repress MEF2 transcription by recruiting HDAC1 to form deacetylating complexes (Brancolini2021Quis). HDAC9 also shares identity with the non-catalytic N-terminal domain of HDAC4 and 5, acting as a transcriptional repressor by recruiting HDAC1 and HDAC3 (Brancolini2021Quis). It interacts with the COOH-terminal-binding protein (CtBP) through a conserved CtBP-binding motif, found in MITR and other class IIa HDACs (Brancolini2021Quis).

In the liver, HDAC9 interacts with forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1), enhancing gluconeogenesis by deacetylating FOXO1 (Yang2021Histone). It also interacts with TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), enhancing its kinase activity and increasing type I interferon production, crucial for the innate immune response (Yang2021Histone). In the context of intervertebral disc degeneration, HDAC9 interacts with RUNX3, regulating its acetylation and stability, which affects cell viability and apoptosis in nucleus pulposus cells (Lei2023Molecular). HDAC9's interactions extend to transcription factors like USF1, influencing adipogenesis and osteogenesis by modulating gene expression (Brancolini2021Quis).
