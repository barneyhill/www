# PRSS22

## Overview
PRSS22 is a gene that encodes the protein serine protease 22, also known as tryptase ε, which belongs to the trypsin-like serine protease family. This protease is primarily expressed in airway epithelial cells and plays a significant role in tissue remodeling and homeostasis within the respiratory tract. The protein is initially synthesized as a zymogen and undergoes maturation to become enzymatically active. Structurally, tryptase ε is characterized by a catalytic triad essential for its proteolytic activity and exhibits unique substrate specificity due to variations in its substrate-binding cleft. Unlike other tryptases, it does not form tetramers but can exist as a homotypic dimer. PRSS22 is also implicated in breast cancer progression, where it interacts with Annexin A1, influencing cancer cell migration and invasion through the FPR2/ERK signaling pathway. The gene's expression is regulated by the transcription factor E2F1, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Song2022E2F1initiated; Wong2001Human).

## Structure
The PRSS22 gene encodes the serine protease 22, also known as tryptase ε, which is a member of the trypsin-like serine protease family. The protein is initially translated as a 34-kDa zymogen and matures into a form with a molecular mass of approximately 30 kDa (Wong2001Human). The primary structure of tryptase ε includes a catalytic triad composed of histidine (His 41), aspartate (Asp 93), and serine (Ser 193), which are crucial for its enzymatic activity (Wong2001Human). 

The tertiary structure of tryptase ε is predicted to be similar to other serine proteases, with seven conserved tryptophan residues that are spatially close on the protein's surface, potentially playing a role in zymogen activation (Wong2001Human). Tryptase ε lacks certain residues necessary for tetramer formation, such as the Pro-Pro-Phe-Pro sequence, and does not have a heparin-binding domain, which distinguishes it from other tryptases (Wong2001Human). 

Post-translational modifications include N-linked glycosylation at Asn 21, as evidenced by a shift in molecular weight following PNGase F treatment (Wong2001Human). Tryptase ε can form a Cys-Cys-linked homotypic dimer when expressed in COS-7 cells (Wong2001Human). The protein's substrate specificity is unique due to residue substitutions in its substrate-binding cleft, which result in structural changes compared to other tryptases (Wong2001Human).

## Function
PRSS22, also known as tryptase ε, is a serine protease primarily expressed in airway epithelial cells, including those in the trachea and esophagus, with significant expression in the fetal lung (Wong2001Human). This protease is involved in proteolytic processes, playing a role in tissue remodeling and homeostasis within the respiratory tract (Wong2001Human). PRSS22 is secreted as a pseudozymogen and can be activated extracellularly, where it participates in cleaving peptide bonds, influencing cellular signaling and tissue integrity (Wong2001Human).

The protein is initially translated as a 34-kDa zymogen and is secreted as an enzymatically active form by epithelial cells, with a mature molecular mass of approximately 30 kDa (Wong2001Human). PRSS22 has a unique substrate preference compared to other tryptases, which may be due to differences in its substrate-binding cleft (Wong2001Human). It does not form tetramers like some other tryptases but can exist as a homotypic dimer, although this is likely rare in vivo (Wong2001Human). The specific physiological substrates and precise functions of PRSS22 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated, but its distinct enzymatic properties suggest a unique role in epithelial cell biology (Wong2001Human).

## Clinical Significance
PRSS22, a serine protease, has been implicated in the progression and metastasis of breast cancer (BC). Its expression is significantly elevated in metastatic BC tissues compared to non-tumorous and non-metastatic BC tissues, suggesting a role in cancer aggressiveness (Song2022E2F1initiated). The transcription factor E2F1 regulates PRSS22 expression, which in turn promotes BC cell migration and invasion through the cleavage of ANXA1 and activation of the FPR2/ERK signaling pathway (Song2022E2F1initiated). Mutations in PRSS22 that disrupt its protease activity, such as PRSS22-R49A and PRSS22-C139A/D141E, result in the loss of its ability to promote ANXA1 cleavage and BC cell migration, highlighting the importance of its enzymatic function in cancer progression (Song2022E2F1initiated).

In addition to its role in breast cancer, PRSS22 is expressed in airway epithelial cells, where it is known as tryptase ε. It is part of a gene cluster on chromosome 16p13.3 and is developmentally regulated in the lung, with high expression in fetal lung tissue (Wong2001Human). However, the clinical significance of PRSS22 mutations or expression alterations in respiratory conditions is not directly addressed in the available literature (Wong2001Human).

## Interactions
PRSS22, a serine protease, is involved in significant protein interactions that influence breast cancer progression. It interacts with Annexin A1 (ANXA1), a substrate in breast cancer cells, promoting its cleavage. This interaction results in the production of an N-terminal peptide that activates the FPR2/ERK signaling pathway, enhancing breast cancer cell migration and invasion (Song2022E2F1initiated). The cleavage of ANXA1 by PRSS22 is crucial for the activation of this pathway, as the N-terminal peptide interacts with the FPR2 receptor, leading to increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2, a key signaling molecule in cancer cell invasion (Song2022E2F1initiated).

The transcription factor E2F1 regulates PRSS22 expression by binding to its promoter region, thereby enhancing its transcription. This regulatory mechanism suggests a feedback loop where E2F1 upregulates PRSS22, which in turn promotes breast cancer metastasis through the ANXA1/FPR2/ERK axis (Song2022E2F1initiated). These interactions highlight the role of PRSS22 in breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention.
