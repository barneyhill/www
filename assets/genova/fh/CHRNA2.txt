# CHRNA2

## Overview
The CHRNA2 gene encodes the cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 2 subunit, a component of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), which is a ligand-gated ion channel. This receptor plays a pivotal role in neurotransmission by facilitating ion flow across cell membranes in response to acetylcholine binding, thereby influencing cognitive processes, muscle contraction, and autonomic nervous system functions. The CHRNA2 protein is categorized as a receptor and features both transmembrane and extracellular ligand-binding domains, essential for its function. It is expressed in specific interneurons within the brain, such as Martinotti cells and oriens-lacunosum moleculare interneurons, contributing to synaptic modulation and neuronal synchronization. Mutations in CHRNA2 are associated with neurological disorders, including autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy and benign familial infantile seizures, underscoring its clinical significance (Hilscher2017Chrna2-Martinotti; Pombero2015The; Villa2019CHRNA2).

## Structure
The CHRNA2 gene encodes the alpha 2 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), a ligand-gated ion channel. The primary structure of the CHRNA2 protein consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's overall conformation. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of the polypeptide, allowing the formation of functional domains necessary for receptor activity. The quaternary structure of the nAChR involves the assembly of multiple subunits, typically forming a pentameric complex composed of various combinations of alpha and beta subunits, which determine the receptor's physiological and pharmacological properties (Villa2019CHRNA2).

The CHRNA2 protein features a transmembrane domain and an extracellular ligand-binding domain, crucial for its function as a receptor. Common post-translational modifications of the CHRNA2 protein include phosphorylation and glycosylation, which can influence receptor function and regulation. The presence of splice variant isoforms may result in proteins with different functional properties, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the available context (Nichol2018Electrophysiological).

## Function
The CHRNA2 gene encodes the alpha 2 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), which is a ligand-gated ion channel involved in neurotransmission. This receptor is crucial for mediating synaptic transmission in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. In healthy human cells, the alpha 2 subunit contributes to the formation of nAChRs that facilitate the flow of ions across cell membranes in response to acetylcholine binding, playing a significant role in cognitive processes, muscle contraction, and autonomic nervous system functions (Pombero2015The).

In the brain, CHRNA2 is expressed in specific interneurons, such as Martinotti cells in the cortex and oriens-lacunosum moleculare (OLM) interneurons in the hippocampus. These cells are involved in modulating synaptic inputs and synchronizing neuronal activity, which is essential for processes like memory formation and cortical information processing (Hilscher2017Chrna2-Martinotti; Nichol2018Electrophysiological). The expression of CHRNA2 in the amygdala suggests its involvement in emotional regulation and social behavior, as it is expressed in medial subpallium-derived amygdalar nuclei from early development to adulthood (Pombero2015The). These functions highlight the gene's role in cholinergic signaling and its impact on neural circuit modulation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CHRNA2 gene, which encodes the alpha-2 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, are associated with several neurological disorders. One of the primary conditions linked to CHRNA2 mutations is autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE). This form of epilepsy is characterized by brief, stereotyped hypermotor seizures that occur predominantly during non-REM sleep. Mutations in CHRNA2 can lead to either gain-of-function or loss-of-function effects on the receptor, impacting its sensitivity to acetylcholine and altering ion channel kinetics (Schaaf2014Nicotinic; Conti2015Nocturnal; Villa2019CHRNA2).

Specific mutations, such as the I279N and p.Tyr252His, have been identified in patients with familial epilepsy characterized by nocturnal wandering and ictal fear, as well as ADNFLE. These mutations increase the receptor's sensitivity to acetylcholine, contributing to the epileptic phenotype (Aridon2006Increased; Villa2019CHRNA2). Additionally, CHRNA2 has been implicated in benign familial infantile seizures (BFIS), expanding its role beyond ADNFLE (Trivisano2015Mutation).

Alterations in CHRNA2 expression have also been linked to cannabis use disorder (CUD), with decreased expression associated with increased risk for CUD and potentially other psychiatric conditions (Demontis2019Genomewide). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CHRNA2 in various neurological and psychiatric disorders.
