# RPS6KB1

## Overview
RPS6KB1 is a gene that encodes the ribosomal protein S6 kinase B1, a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in the regulation of protein synthesis and cell growth. The protein, often referred to as S6K1, is a key component of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, which is involved in cellular processes such as growth, proliferation, and survival. S6K1 is activated through phosphorylation by mTORC1, which enhances its ability to phosphorylate downstream targets, including the S6 ribosomal protein, thereby promoting protein synthesis. The kinase exists in multiple isoforms, such as p70-S6K1, p85-S6K1, and p31-S6K1, each with distinct roles and cellular localizations. Dysregulation of RPS6KB1 expression and activity has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and multiple sclerosis, making it a significant focus of biomedical research (Magnuson2011Regulation; Holz2005mTOR; Akbarian2020Upregulation).

## Structure
The RPS6KB1 gene encodes the ribosomal protein S6 kinase B1, also known as S6K1, which is a serine/threonine kinase involved in protein synthesis regulation. The primary structure of S6K1 includes a kinase domain and a regulatory domain, with several isoforms resulting from alternative splicing and translation initiation. Notable isoforms include p70-S6K1, p85-S6K1, and p31-S6K1, each with distinct cellular functions and localizations (Pende2014Ribosomal; Zaiets2018The).

The secondary structure of S6K1 features alpha helices and beta sheets, which fold into a functional tertiary structure. The protein's quaternary structure may involve dimerization, although specific details are not extensively covered in the context. Key domains include the catalytic domain and an autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate domain, which regulates kinase activity (Magnuson2011Regulation).

Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, play a crucial role in regulating S6K1 activity. Phosphorylation at sites such as Thr 389 and Thr 229 is essential for its activation, with mTORC1 and PDK1 being key kinases involved in this process (Magnuson2011Regulation; Arif2019Multisite). These modifications create a phospho-code that influences substrate selection and kinase activity (Arif2019Multisite).

## Function
RPS6KB1, also known as ribosomal protein S6 kinase B1, is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a pivotal role in the mTOR signaling pathway, which is crucial for regulating cell growth, proliferation, and survival. In healthy human cells, RPS6KB1 is involved in the phosphorylation of the S6 ribosomal protein, enhancing protein synthesis by promoting the assembly of the translation preinitiation complex. This process is essential for cap-dependent translation, a critical step in protein biosynthesis (Magnuson2011Regulation; Holz2005mTOR).

RPS6KB1 is activated by mTORC1 through phosphorylation at specific sites, such as Thr 389, which is necessary for its full activation and subsequent phosphorylation of downstream targets like eIF4B and the 40S ribosomal protein S6. These phosphorylation events facilitate the recruitment of eIF4B into the translation preinitiation complex, promoting efficient protein synthesis (Magnuson2011Regulation; Holz2005mTOR).

In addition to its role in protein synthesis, RPS6KB1 influences cell growth and size by regulating lipid biosynthesis and cell metabolism. It also plays a role in cell survival by phosphorylating the pro-apoptotic molecule BAD, thereby promoting cell survival and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Magnuson2011Regulation; Harada2001p70S6).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and activity of the RPS6KB1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in cancer and multiple sclerosis (MS). In the context of cancer, RPS6KB1 is often overexpressed, contributing to increased cell proliferation, invasion, and tumor growth. This overexpression is notably observed in esophageal cancer, where it is a direct target of miR-30e, a microRNA that is downregulated in these cancer cells. The miR-30e/RPS6KB1 axis is considered a potential therapeutic target, as restoring miR-30e levels can suppress RPS6KB1 expression and reduce tumor progression (Wang2021MiRNA-30e).

In multiple sclerosis, particularly relapsing-remitting MS, RPS6KB1 is upregulated, which is associated with the dysregulation of the mTOR pathway. This pathway is crucial for immune responses and cellular protein production, affecting the function of immune cells and myelination processes. The upregulation of RPS6KB1, along with MTOR and EIF4EBP1, has significant diagnostic value in differentiating MS patients from healthy individuals, suggesting its role as a biomarker for MS (Akbarian2020Upregulation).

In gastrointestinal cancers driven by KRAS mutations, RPS6KB1 is a critical downstream effector of AURKA, and its phosphorylation is essential for cancer cell survival. Inhibition of AURKA reduces RPS6KB1 activity, highlighting the potential of targeting this pathway in cancer therapy (WangBishop2019Inhibition).

## Interactions
RPS6KB1, also known as p70-S6K1, is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a significant role in the mTOR signaling pathway, influencing cell growth and protein synthesis. It interacts with various proteins, forming part of complex signaling networks. RPS6KB1 is known to interact with proteins such as CAD, AMPK, IRS1, GSK3, and PFK2, which are involved in processes like protein synthesis, mRNA splicing, and cytoskeleton organization (Pavan2016Different). It also interacts with eIF4B and HSP90, and phosphatases PPM1A and PPM1B, which have high SAINT probability scores, indicating strong interactions (Pavan2016Different).

In the context of cancer, RPS6KB1 is phosphorylated by AURKA at threonine 389, a modification crucial for its catalytic activity and the proliferation of gastrointestinal cancer cells with activated KRAS (WangBishop2019Inhibition). This phosphorylation is disrupted by the inhibition of AURKA, suggesting a direct regulatory interaction between these proteins (WangBishop2019Inhibition). Additionally, miR-30e has been identified as a regulator of RPS6KB1, binding to its 3′-untranslated region and inhibiting its expression, which affects cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth (Wang2021MiRNA-30e). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of RPS6KB1 in cellular processes and disease contexts.
