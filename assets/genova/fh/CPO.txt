# CPO

## Overview
Carboxypeptidase O (CPO) is a gene that encodes the enzyme carboxypeptidase O, a member of the M14 family of metallocarboxypeptidases. This enzyme is characterized by its glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchoring, which localizes it to the apical membrane of intestinal epithelial cells, where it plays a role in the digestion of dietary proteins. The protein exhibits specificity for acidic C-terminal residues, facilitated by its unique substrate-binding pocket, and functions as a homodimer. The structural integrity and enzymatic activity of carboxypeptidase O are dependent on zinc coordination within its active site, which is crucial for its catalytic function (GarciaGuerrero2018Crystal; Lyons2011Carboxypeptidase). Additionally, the enzyme's interactions with proteinaceous inhibitors and its association with lipid droplets suggest a broader role in cellular processes related to lipid metabolism and membrane dynamics (Burke2018Carboxypeptidase).

## Structure
Carboxypeptidase O (CPO) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored enzyme localized to the apical membrane of intestinal epithelial cells. The primary structure of CPO includes an N-terminal signal peptide, a catalytic domain, and a C-terminal sequence that facilitates GPI anchoring (Lyons2011Carboxypeptidase). The enzyme is N-glycosylated, with glycosylation sites identified at Asn154, Asn167, and Asn231, contributing to its higher molecular mass compared to predictions (GarciaGuerrero2018Crystal).

The secondary structure of CPO features the classic α/β-hydrolase fold typical of the M14 family of metallocarboxypeptidases, consisting of a central twisted eight-stranded mixed β-sheet flanked by eight α-helices (GarciaGuerrero2018Crystal). The tertiary structure reveals a homodimeric quaternary structure, indicating that CPO functions as a dimer (GarciaGuerrero2018Crystal).

CPO's active site includes critical residues for zinc coordination and catalysis, such as His-69, Glu-72, His-196, and Glu-270, which are essential for its enzymatic activity (Lyons2011Carboxypeptidase). The enzyme's specificity for acidic C-terminal residues is largely due to the presence of Arg275 in the substrate-binding pocket, which interacts with negatively charged carboxylate groups (GarciaGuerrero2018Crystal).

## Interactions
Carboxypeptidase O (CPO) interacts with various proteinaceous inhibitors, notably the NvCI inhibitor from the sea snail Nerita versicolor. This interaction is characterized by a competitive substrate-like mechanism, where the C-terminal tail of NvCI occludes the active site of CPO, specifically blocking the S2 and S1 subsites. The C-terminal carboxylate group of Ala53 in NvCI coordinates with the zinc atom in a bidentate manner, and additional interactions include hydrogen bonds involving Tyr268, Arg90, and Arg146 (GarciaGuerrero2018Crystal). The binding of NvCI induces significant conformational changes in the active site of CPO, particularly in the side chain of Tyr268, which rotates to close the active site pocket (GarciaGuerrero2018Crystal).

CPO is also associated with lipid droplets and cholesterol-rich membranes, suggesting potential interactions with proteins involved in lipid droplet formation and membrane dynamics. Its activity is modulated by cholesterol, which affects its association with lipid droplets and potentially influences its exposure to substrates (Burke2018Carboxypeptidase). CPO's interaction with substrates is specific, as it cleaves C-terminal glutamate but not hydrophobic amino acids like leucine (Burke2018Carboxypeptidase).
