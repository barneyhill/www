# TRMT2B

## Overview
TRMT2B is a gene in humans that encodes the protein tRNA methyltransferase 2 homolog B, which is categorized as a methyltransferase. This protein plays a critical role in the post-transcriptional modification of mitochondrial tRNAs and rRNAs, specifically catalyzing the methylation of uridine residues. Such modifications are essential for the proper assembly and function of the mitochondrial ribosome, thereby influencing mitochondrial translation and cellular energy metabolism. Although TRMT2B is integral to these processes, its precise role in mitochondrial translation remains somewhat ambiguous, as knockout studies have not shown significant effects on RNA stability or cellular growth, indicating potential compensatory mechanisms within the cell (JedynakSlyvka2021Human).

## Function
TRMT2B is a human gene encoding a protein involved in the methylation of mitochondrial tRNAs and rRNAs. This protein specifically catalyzes the methylation of uridine in tRNAs and is responsible for the methylation at position 429 (m5U429) in 12S rRNA. These modifications are crucial for the proper assembly and function of the mitochondrial ribosome, which is essential for mitochondrial translation (JedynakSlyvka2021Human). Despite its involvement in these methylation processes, the exact contribution of TRMT2B to mitochondrial translation remains unclear, as human cells with TRMT2B knockout did not exhibit phenotypes related to RNA stability, mitochondrial translation, or cellular growth. This suggests that TRMT2B's role in mitochondrial translation and overall cellular function in healthy cells may be complex or compensated by other factors (JedynakSlyvka2021Human).

TRMT2B is active in the mitochondria, contributing to mitochondrial gene expression and overall cellular energy metabolism. Its activity is part of a broader set of modifications that occur in mitochondrial rRNAs, including 2'-O-methylation, nucleobase methylation, and pseudouridylation, which are essential for the stability and proper functioning of tRNA, impacting protein synthesis (JedynakSlyvka2021Human).
