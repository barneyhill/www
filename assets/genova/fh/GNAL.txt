# GNAL

## Overview
The GNAL gene encodes the G protein subunit alpha L (Gα olf), a critical component of the Gαs class of G proteins involved in signal transduction processes, particularly within the olfactory system. This protein plays a pivotal role in mediating responses to odorant molecules by activating adenylyl cyclase, which in turn increases cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels, facilitating downstream signaling pathways (Wettschureck2005Mammalian). Gα olf is characterized by its intrinsic disorder and the presence of molecular recognition features (MoRFs), which enable it to participate in diverse protein-protein interactions (Fonin2019Multifunctionality). Beyond its role in olfaction, GNAL is implicated in neurotransmission within the basal ganglia, interacting with dopamine and adenosine receptors to modulate neurological functions (Corvol2001Gαolf). Mutations in GNAL are clinically significant, being associated with isolated dystonia and potentially linked to psychiatric disorders, highlighting its importance in both sensory perception and motor control (Domingo2016Novel; Lange2021Genotype–Phenotype).

## Structure
The GNAL gene encodes the Gα olf subunit, a protein involved in signal transduction. This protein consists of 381 amino acids and is characterized by a moderate level of intrinsic disorder, with a percentage of disordered residues (PDR) of 19.4% (Fonin2019Multifunctionality). The N-terminus of the protein, comprising residues 1-50, is highly disordered and contains two molecular recognition features (MoRFs), which are regions capable of undergoing disorder-to-order transitions upon binding to specific partners, indicating a role in protein-protein interactions (Fonin2019Multifunctionality).

The Gα olf subunit also includes several post-translational modification (PTM) sites, which are crucial for its regulation and function (Fonin2019Multifunctionality). The presence of multiple alternatively spliced isoforms, primarily affecting the disordered N-terminal region, suggests a mechanism for functional diversity (Fonin2019Multifunctionality). These structural features, including intrinsic disorder and PTMs, suggest that the Gα olf subunit has a flexible structure, allowing it to participate in various signaling pathways (Fonin2019Multifunctionality). However, specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of the GNAL protein are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The GNAL gene encodes the G protein subunit alpha L, which plays a critical role in signal transduction processes within the olfactory system. This protein is primarily involved in mediating signal transduction in response to odorant molecules, facilitating the activation of adenylyl cyclase type 1, a key effector in G protein-mediated signaling pathways (Wettschureck2005Mammalian). The Gα olf subunit, encoded by GNAL, is part of the Gαs class of G proteins, which are known for stimulating adenylyl cyclase activity, leading to the production of cyclic AMP (cAMP) and the activation of downstream signaling pathways (Wettschureck2005Mammalian).

In the olfactory system, Gα olf is essential for signaling by olfactory receptors in response to odorant stimuli. It couples these receptors to adenylyl cyclase III, resulting in increased cAMP formation, which activates a cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channel. This signaling pathway is crucial for normal olfactory function, as demonstrated by the anosmic phenotype observed in Gα olf-deficient mice (Wettschureck2005Mammalian). The GNAL gene's product is active in the cell membrane, where it interacts with receptors to influence sensory perception and neurological functions (Wettschureck2005Mammalian).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GNAL gene are associated with isolated dystonia, a movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions. GNAL-related dystonia typically presents as adult-onset focal dystonia, often affecting the cervical region, but can also manifest as segmental or generalized dystonia (Vemula2013Role; Lange2021Genotype–Phenotype). The median age of onset is around 38 years, with a significant number of cases having a positive family history, indicating an autosomal-dominant inheritance pattern (Lange2021Genotype–Phenotype). GNAL mutations exhibit incomplete penetrance, meaning not all carriers show symptoms (Vemula2013Role).

The GNAL gene encodes the α-subunit of a G-protein involved in dopamine signaling pathways, which are crucial for normal motor function. Alterations in GNAL can disrupt these pathways, contributing to the pathophysiology of dystonia (Jinnah2019Dystonia). Treatment options for GNAL-related dystonia include botulinum toxin injections and deep brain stimulation (DBS), with the latter showing promising results in some cases (Tisch2021Pallidal; Lange2021Genotype–Phenotype).

In addition to dystonia, altered expression or interactions of GNAL may be linked to psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, affecting neural signaling pathways (Domingo2016Novel).

## Interactions
The GNAL gene encodes the Gα(olf) protein, which is involved in several interactions with other proteins, playing a crucial role in signal transduction pathways. Gα(olf) is a subunit of a heterotrimeric G protein that interacts with dopamine D1 receptors and adenosine A2A receptors in the striatum to activate adenylyl cyclase, leading to increased intracellular cAMP levels (Khan2019Gnal; Corvol2001Gαolf). This interaction is essential for dopamine and adenosine neurotransmission in the basal ganglia (Corvol2001Gαolf).

Gα(olf) also forms a functional heterotrimeric G protein with β2γ7 subunits in the striatum, and mutations in GNAL can lead to unsequestered β2γ7, potentially affecting the activity of effector proteins such as phospholipase C, GIRK channels, and calcium channels (Moehle2024Mechanisms). Additionally, the GNAL protein has a highly disordered N-terminus containing Molecular Recognition Features (MoRFs), which suggests potential interaction sites for binding to other molecules (Fonin2019Multifunctionality).

XLGα(olf), another protein encoded by GNAL, interacts with USP3, BABAM1 (MERIT40), and SPATA2, indicating a role in DNA damage repair and cell-cycle control (Khan2019Gnal). These interactions suggest that GNAL is involved in both neurotransmission and cellular regulatory processes.
