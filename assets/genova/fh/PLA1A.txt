# PLA1A

## Overview
PLA1A, or phospholipase A1 member A, is a gene that encodes a phospholipase enzyme involved in lipid metabolism and signaling. The protein product of PLA1A is a phospholipase enzyme that specifically hydrolyzes the sn-1 position of phospholipids, such as phosphatidylserine (PS), to release fatty acids and generate lysophospholipids, including lysophosphatidylserine (lysoPS) (Zhao2021Phosphatidylserine-specific). This enzyme plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including immune regulation and inflammation, by modulating lipid signaling pathways (Zhao2021Phosphatidylserine-specific). PLA1A is expressed in multiple tissues, with significant expression in the liver and prostate gland, and exists in several isoforms that differ in their enzymatic activity and substrate specificity (Zhao2021Phosphatidylserine-specific). The enzyme's activity is also implicated in pathological conditions, such as cancer and autoimmune diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Zhao2021Phosphatidylserine-specific).

## Structure
PLA1A, or phospholipase A1 member A, is an enzyme characterized by its ability to hydrolyze phospholipids, specifically targeting the sn-1 position to release fatty acids and produce lysophospholipids. The primary structure of PLA1A includes a catalytic triad composed of serine, aspartic acid, and histidine residues, which are crucial for its enzymatic activity (Zhao2021Phosphatidylserine-specific). The enzyme features a short lid domain and a deleted β9 loop, which are structural adaptations that facilitate its specific activity on phosphatidylserine (PS) and lysophosphatidylserine (lysoPS) (Zhao2021Phosphatidylserine-specific).

PLA1A undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which are important for its function and stability (Inoue2006Phospholipase). The enzyme is expressed in various tissues, with notable expression in the liver and prostate gland (Zhao2021Phosphatidylserine-specific). PLA1A exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, with variant 1 encoding the full-length protein. A truncated form, PLA1AΔC, lacks part of the C-terminal domain, affecting its ability to hydrolyze PS but retaining lysophospholipase activity (Zhao2021Phosphatidylserine-specific). These structural features and modifications contribute to the enzyme's role in lipid metabolism and its involvement in physiological processes such as immune regulation and inflammation (Zhao2021Phosphatidylserine-specific).

## Function
PLA1A, or phospholipase A1 member A, is an enzyme involved in the hydrolysis of phosphatidylserine (PS) to produce lysophosphatidylserine (lysoPS), which plays a significant role in lipid signaling and immune regulation. In healthy human cells, PLA1A is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, lung, and prostate gland, and is involved in lipid metabolism and the remodeling of cell membranes (Zhao2021Phosphatidylserine-specific). The enzyme specifically hydrolyzes the sn-1 fatty acid of PS, contributing to the production of unsaturated lysoPS species that regulate immune cell functions (Zhao2021Phosphatidylserine-specific).

PLA1A is active in the cytoplasm and can convert externalized PS on activated or apoptotic cells into lysoPS, which can be further metabolized into lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) by autotaxin (ATX) (Zhao2021Phosphatidylserine-specific). This process is crucial for immune cell reprogramming and modulation of immune responses, impacting processes such as T cell proliferation and mast cell activation (Zhao2021Phosphatidylserine-specific). PLA1A's activity in healthy cells involves the regulation of lipid mediators and signaling pathways, contributing to cellular homeostasis and immune responses (Zhao2021Phosphatidylserine-specific).

## Clinical Significance
The PLA1A gene is clinically significant due to its involvement in various diseases, primarily through alterations in its expression levels. Elevated PLA1A expression is associated with several types of cancer, including melanoma, prostate, liver, gastric, colorectal, and glioma cancers. In these cancers, high PLA1A levels correlate with tumor progression and poor disease outcomes, often through mechanisms involving the PI3K/Akt pathway and lysoPS production, which can promote tumor invasion and metastasis (Zhao2021Phosphatidylserine-specific).

In autoimmune disorders, PLA1A expression is notably increased in conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Graves' disease. In SLE, high serum PLA1A levels are observed, although they do not correlate with disease activity indices. In Graves' disease, PLA1A levels correlate with thyroid hormone levels and decrease with antithyroid treatment (Zhao2021Phosphatidylserine-specific).

PLA1A is also implicated in cardiovascular diseases, such as acute coronary syndrome, where its elevated levels are linked to platelet activation and blood clotting. Additionally, PLA1A is involved in hepatitis C virus assembly and replication, suggesting a role in viral pathogenesis (Zhao2021Phosphatidylserine-specific). These findings highlight the gene's potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
PLA1A (phospholipase A1 member A) is involved in several interactions that influence its role in lipid metabolism and signaling pathways. One significant interaction is with autotaxin (ATX), where PLA1A-derived lysophosphatidylserine (lysoPS) is metabolized by ATX into lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). This conversion is crucial for activating the LPA receptor axis, which plays a role in inflammatory processes and immune responses (Zhao2021Phospholipase).

PLA1A also interacts with phosphatidylserine (PS) on cell membranes. It hydrolyzes PS to produce lysoPS, which can be further converted to LPA, influencing cellular signaling pathways (Zhao2021Phospholipase). This interaction is particularly relevant in the context of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs), where PLA1A activity leads to the secretion of interleukin-8 (IL-8), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, through the ATX-LPA receptor axis (Zhao2021Phospholipase).

In the context of viral infections, PLA1A interacts with hepatitis C virus (HCV) proteins E2, NS2, and NS5A, facilitating viral assembly and replication by stabilizing essential protein complexes (Zhao2021Phosphatidylserine-specific). These interactions highlight PLA1A's role in both physiological and pathological processes.
