# CHRNA4

## Overview
The CHRNA4 gene encodes the cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 4 subunit, a critical component of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), which is a ligand-gated ion channel. This protein is integral to neurotransmission, facilitating the flow of ions across the cell membrane upon activation by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. The α4 subunit, in conjunction with the β2 subunit, forms the α4β2 nAChR subtype, which is the most prevalent in the mammalian brain and plays a significant role in modulating synaptic transmission and cognitive functions (McClureBegley2014Rare; Steinlein1996Exon–Intron). The CHRNA4 gene is located on chromosome 20q13.2-q13.3 and consists of six exons, with the protein product containing four hydrophobic domains that span the membrane, characteristic of nAChR subunits (Steinlein1996Exon–Intron). Mutations in CHRNA4 are associated with various neurological conditions, including autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy and potentially other neuropsychiatric disorders (Winterer2007Association; Steinlein2008Neuronal).

## Structure
The CHRNA4 gene encodes the α4 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, which is a ligand-gated ion channel. The primary structure of the CHRNA4 protein consists of 627 amino acids, with an ATG start codon located in exon 1 and a termination signal in exon 6 (Steinlein1996Exon–Intron). The protein includes four hydrophobic domains that are potential membrane-spanning regions, characteristic of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α subunits (Steinlein1996Exon–Intron). These domains are likely involved in forming the secondary structure of the protein.

The tertiary structure of the CHRNA4 protein is influenced by a crucial disulfide bond between amino acids 197 and 198, which is important for acetylcholine binding (Steinlein1996Exon–Intron). The quaternary structure involves the assembly of the α4 subunit with other subunits to form a functional receptor complex, such as the α4β2 receptor, which is a high-affinity receptor for nicotine (Bertrand2001Neuronal; McClureBegley2014Rare).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, occur in the M3-M4 intracellular loop of the α4 subunit, affecting receptor assembly and function (McClureBegley2014Rare). The CHRNA4 gene is a single-copy gene, and its exon-intron splice sites follow the AG/GT rule (Steinlein1996Exon–Intron).

## Function
The CHRNA4 gene encodes the alpha4 subunit of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), which is a ligand-gated ion channel involved in neurotransmission. This receptor is activated by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, allowing the flow of ions across the cell membrane and leading to neuronal excitation (Steinlein1996Exon–Intron). The alpha4 subunit is a component of the high-affinity alpha4beta2 nAChR subtype, which is the most abundant in the mammalian brain and plays a crucial role in modulating synaptic transmission (McClureBegley2014Rare; Millar2009Diversity).

The CHRNA4 gene is located on chromosome 20q13.2-q13.3 and consists of six exons, with the main coding region in exon 5 (Steinlein1996Exon–Intron). The protein encoded by CHRNA4 contains four hydrophobic domains characteristic of membrane-spanning regions in nAChR subunits, and a crucial disulfide bond at amino acid positions 197 and 198 for acetylcholine binding (Steinlein1996Exon–Intron). The alpha4beta2 nAChRs are involved in high-affinity nicotine binding and are implicated in various neurological processes, including attention and cognitive function (Winterer2007Association; Millar2009Diversity).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CHRNA4 gene are primarily associated with autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE), a form of idiopathic epilepsy characterized by brief motor seizures during sleep. These seizures often involve dystonic movements, limb stiffening, and vocalizations. The age of onset varies widely, and the condition is typically managed with antiepileptic drugs like carbamazepine (Sáenz1999Autosomal; Steinlein2008Neuronal). Specific mutations, such as Ser248Phe and an insertion of an extra leucine residue, have been identified, affecting the receptor's sensitivity to acetylcholine and contributing to the pathogenesis of ADNFLE (Steinlein1997An).

CHRNA4 mutations have also been linked to psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia-like symptoms, and may influence attentional network function, potentially affecting nicotine dependence and other neuropsychiatric conditions (Winterer2007Association; Steinlein2008Neuronal). Additionally, rare variants in CHRNA4 have been associated with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (SALS), suggesting a potential role in neurodegenerative diseases (Sabatelli2012Replication). Polymorphisms in CHRNA4 have been implicated in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, indicating a broader impact on epileptic disorders (Rozycka2009The).

## Interactions
The CHRNA4 gene encodes the α4 subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which are involved in neurotransmission. This subunit interacts with the β2 subunit to form the α4β2 nAChR subtype, a prevalent receptor in the mammalian brain. The α4 subunit participates in various protein-protein interactions that influence receptor assembly, expression, and function. Rare variants of CHRNA4, such as α4P451L, have been shown to disrupt normal protein interactions, including associations with common nAChR chaperones and the transport protein VAPB. The α4P451L variant also recruits importin isoforms, although this does not result in nuclear import, suggesting a role in receptor assembly and posttranslational modification (McClureBegley2014Rare).

The α4 subunit's interactions are crucial for the stoichiometry and sensitivity of the assembled nAChRs. For instance, the α4P451L variant preferentially forms high-sensitivity nAChRs, even under conditions that typically support low-sensitivity receptor assembly (McClureBegley2014Rare). These interactions and the resulting receptor configurations can significantly impact nicotine addiction and neurodegenerative disease risk, highlighting the importance of CHRNA4 in modulating receptor function through its protein interactions (McClureBegley2014Rare).
