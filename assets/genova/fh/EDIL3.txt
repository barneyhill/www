# EDIL3

## Overview
EDIL3, or EGF-like repeats and discoidin domains 3, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in critical cellular processes such as angiogenesis, cell adhesion, and osteoblast differentiation. The protein, often referred to as Del-1, is characterized by its EGF-like repeats and discoidin domains, which facilitate interactions with integrins, particularly αvβ3 and αvβ5, playing a pivotal role in endothelial cell functions and vascular development (Shen2017EDIL3; Hidai1998Cloning). Through these interactions, EDIL3 influences various signaling pathways, including the ERK/Runx2 pathway, which is essential for bone formation and maintenance (Oh2017The). Additionally, EDIL3 is implicated in maintaining cartilage integrity and has been associated with several pathological conditions, including cancer and vascular disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Chen2023The; Sauvigny2020Exome).

## Structure
The EDIL3 gene encodes a protein characterized by the presence of EGF-like repeats and discoidin domains, which are integral to its function in angiogenesis and cell adhesion. The EGF-like repeats facilitate protein-protein interactions, a critical aspect of the protein's role in cellular processes. These repeats are typically involved in the formation of secondary structures that enable the protein to interact with other cellular components. The discoidin domains are responsible for binding to phospholipids, contributing to the protein's ability to mediate cell adhesion and signaling pathways.

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are likely to occur in the EDIL3 protein, affecting its stability and functional capabilities. Glycosylation can influence the protein's folding and interactions, potentially altering its biological activity. The presence of splice variants of the EDIL3 gene results in different isoforms of the protein, which may exhibit variations in their biological functions. These isoforms can lead to differences in the protein's interaction with other molecules and its role in physiological processes. The structural diversity introduced by these splice variants underscores the complexity of the EDIL3 protein's function in human biology.

## Function
EDIL3, also known as Del-1, is a protein involved in various cellular processes, primarily through its interactions with integrins. In healthy human cells, EDIL3 plays a significant role in angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formation, by promoting endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation. This is crucial for vascular development and repair, as EDIL3 facilitates endothelial cell attachment and migration, which are essential for blood vessel formation (Shen2017EDIL3).

EDIL3 is also involved in osteoblast differentiation, where it stimulates the expression of osteoblast-specific genes and matrix mineralization. This process is mediated through the integrin α5β1/ERK/Runx2 signaling pathway, highlighting its role in bone formation and maintenance. EDIL3's interaction with integrins is critical for osteoblast differentiation and function, as it activates the ERK pathway, leading to increased Runx2 expression, which is essential for osteogenic differentiation (Oh2017The).

In the context of cartilage health, EDIL3 helps maintain the extracellular matrix and inhibits osteoarthritis development. It protects chondrocytes from apoptosis and supports the expression of cartilage-specific genes, contributing to cartilage integrity and function (Chen2023The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the EDIL3 gene have been implicated in various diseases. In colorectal cancer, EDIL3 is frequently mutated, with 11 mutations identified, including one nonsense and ten missense mutations. These mutations, particularly the nonsense mutation at p.I289*, can lead to early termination of the EDIL3 protein, potentially affecting its function and contributing to disease pathology (Sagkan2021Identification). In pancreatic cancer, EDIL3 expression is upregulated, suggesting its potential role as a tumor marker. The study identified specific missense mutations, such as p.L9I and p.D52Y, which may have pathogenic effects (AKIN2021Mutations).

EDIL3 is also associated with vascular disorders. It has been identified as a potential risk factor for unruptured intracranial aneurysms and subarachnoid hemorrhage, with specific missense variants like p.(Cys128Tyr) and p.(Lys387Gln) affecting conserved domains and potentially compromising its function (Sauvigny2020Exome). In osteoarthritis, EDIL3 plays a protective role by maintaining cartilage extracellular matrix and inhibiting chondrocyte loss, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Chen2023The). In classical Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, decreased EDIL3 expression is linked to impaired cell-matrix interactions, highlighting its role in the disease's pathogenesis (Chiarelli2019Molecular).

## Interactions
EDIL3, also known as Del1, is a protein that interacts with integrins, particularly αvβ3 and αvβ5, playing a significant role in cell adhesion and angiogenesis. The interaction between EDIL3 and the αvβ3 integrin receptor is crucial for various cellular processes, including endothelial cell adhesion and migration. This interaction is mediated by an RGD motif present in the EGF-like repeat domains of EDIL3, which facilitates binding to the integrin receptors (Hidai1998Cloning).

In cancer cells, EDIL3 interacts with integrin αvβ3 to promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and resistance to chemotherapy drugs like paclitaxel. Blocking this interaction with cilengitide can reverse EMT and restore drug sensitivity, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting EDIL3-integrin interactions in cancer treatment (Gasca2020EDIL3).

EDIL3 also plays a role in protecting hepatocellular carcinoma cells from anoikis, a form of apoptosis, through its interaction with integrins αV and α5. This interaction activates the FAK-Src-AKT signaling pathway, contributing to cancer cell survival and resistance to detachment-induced cell death (Feng2014Elevated).
