# CCDC9B

## Overview
CCDC9B is a gene that encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 9B protein, which is implicated in various cellular processes, including RNA methylation and protein-protein interactions. The protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domain, which facilitates its involvement in protein and RNA remodeling complexes. CCDC9B interacts with several proteins, such as IVNS1ABP, CHTOP, PDIA4, and RCN2, suggesting a regulatory role in cellular pathways, particularly those associated with the MYC oncogene. The stability and expression of CCDC9B are influenced by NSUN7-mediated methylation, which is crucial for its function. Alterations in CCDC9B expression, often due to epigenetic changes affecting NSUN7, have been linked to liver cancer, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (OrtizBarahona2023Epigenetic).

## Function
The CCDC9B gene encodes a protein involved in RNA methylation processes, specifically the methylation of cytosine residues in RNA. This methylation is catalyzed by the enzyme NSUN7, a 5-methylcytosine RNA methyltransferase. In healthy human cells, NSUN7-mediated methylation of CCDC9B mRNA at specific cytosine sites is associated with increased stability of the mRNA transcript, leading to higher levels of CCDC9B protein expression. This process is crucial for maintaining the stability and proper expression of the CCDC9B protein, which may play a role in cellular functions that are yet to be fully elucidated (OrtizBarahona2023Epigenetic).

The CCDC9B protein is involved in protein and RNA remodeling complexes, suggesting a role in protein-protein interactions due to its coiled-coil domain. It interacts with proteins such as IVNS1ABP, CHTOP, PDIA4, and RCN2, indicating that CCDC9B may regulate the levels of these proteins through binding mechanisms. The interaction with IVNS1ABP, a MYC-regulator, suggests a potential role in MYC-associated pathways, which are significant in the context of cancer biology (OrtizBarahona2023Epigenetic).

## Clinical Significance
The CCDC9B gene has been implicated in liver cancer, particularly through its interactions with the MYC-regulator IVNS1ABP protein. Alterations in CCDC9B expression, such as those caused by the epigenetic inactivation of the NSUN7 gene, lead to decreased stability of CCDC9B mRNA. This instability results in reduced protein levels, which in turn affects the MYC signaling pathway, a critical pathway in cancer development. The loss of CCDC9B mRNA stability due to NSUN7 inactivation is associated with increased sensitivity to bromodomain inhibitors, suggesting a potential therapeutic vulnerability in liver cancer (OrtizBarahona2023Epigenetic).

The study highlights that NSUN7-mediated methylation is crucial for maintaining CCDC9B expression, and its loss may contribute to liver cancer pathology. NSUN7 promoter hypermethylation, leading to its silencing, increases sensitivity to bromodomain inhibitors like JQ1, PFI-1, and i-BET, indicating that the CCDC9B-IVNS1ABP-MYC axis could be a therapeutic target in liver cancer (OrtizBarahona2023Epigenetic). These findings suggest a link between CCDC9B interactions and liver cancer, particularly in the context of NSUN7 epigenetic inactivation and MYC pathway modulation.

## Interactions
CCDC9B is involved in several protein-protein interactions, particularly in the context of liver cancer. It is part of various protein and RNA remodeling complexes, facilitated by its coiled-coil domain, which suggests a role in protein-protein interactions. In a study using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry in HEP3B2-1-7 cells, four proteins were identified as interacting with CCDC9B: IVNS1ABP, CHTOP, PDIA4, and RCN2. Among these, IVNS1ABP was highlighted as a significant partner, with its interaction confirmed through mass spectrometry spectra (OrtizBarahona2023Epigenetic).

The interaction between CCDC9B and IVNS1ABP is particularly noteworthy in the context of NSUN7-mediated methylation. NSUN7, a 5-methylcytosine RNA methyltransferase, stabilizes CCDC9B mRNA through methylation, which in turn facilitates CCDC9B's interaction with IVNS1ABP. This interaction is crucial as it reduces the abundance of IVNS1ABP, a MYC regulator, thereby influencing MYC signaling pathways. The study suggests that the loss of NSUN7, and consequently the destabilization of CCDC9B mRNA, leads to the upregulation of IVNS1ABP, which could increase sensitivity to bromodomain inhibitors in liver cancer cells (OrtizBarahona2023Epigenetic).
