# TGFBR3

## Overview
The TGFBR3 gene encodes the transforming growth factor beta receptor 3, also known as betaglycan, which is a transmembrane proteoglycan that functions as a co-receptor in the TGF-β signaling pathway. This receptor is integral to various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, by facilitating the interaction of TGF-β ligands with type I and II receptors. Structurally, TGFBR3 is characterized by a large extracellular domain, a single transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic tail, with post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation influencing its function. TGFBR3 plays a pivotal role in epicardial cell processes, such as epithelial-mesenchymal transformation, and is involved in regulating gene expression related to cell adhesion and extracellular matrix organization. Its interactions with other proteins, such as GIPC and TGFBR2, enhance its role in TGF-β signaling. Clinically, alterations in TGFBR3 expression are associated with various cancers and other diseases, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and pathological conditions (LópezCasillas1993Betaglycan; Blobe2001A; Dronkers2020Epicardial).

## Structure
The TGFBR3 gene encodes betaglycan, a transmembrane proteoglycan that serves as a co-receptor for the TGF-β family of ligands. The primary structure of TGFBR3 includes a core protein with glycosaminoglycan chains, specifically heparin and chondroitin sulfate, attached to a 100 kDa core protein (LópezCasillas1993Betaglycan). The protein's secondary structure features typical protein motifs, including a short alpha-helix-beta-strand motif in the orphan domain, which affects its binding manner (Kim2019Structural).

The tertiary structure of TGFBR3 involves a large extracellular domain divided into two main regions: the orphan domain and the zona pellucida (ZP) domain. The orphan domain is involved in binding TGF-β ligands, while the ZP-C domain binds TGF-β isoforms and inhibin A (Wieteska2024Structures). The protein also includes a single transmembrane region and a short cytoplasmic tail (Kim2019Structural).

In terms of quaternary structure, TGFBR3 can form complexes with other TGF-β receptors, enhancing the assembly of the signaling complex (Kim2019Structural). Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation are common, and splice variant isoforms may alter its function.

## Function
TGFBR3, or transforming growth factor beta receptor 3, is a co-receptor that plays a crucial role in the TGF-beta signaling pathway, influencing various cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. It is primarily active in the cell membrane, where it binds to TGF-beta ligands and facilitates their interaction with type I and II receptors, enhancing the cell's responsiveness to TGF-beta (Dronkers2020Epicardial).

In epicardial cells, TGFBR3 is essential for the epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) process, which is critical for coronary vessel development. It activates the Par6/Smurf1/RhoA pathway, a noncanonical signaling route necessary for cell invasion and maintaining epithelial cell polarity (Sánchez2012TGFβ). TGFBR3's interaction with the scaffolding protein GIPC is vital for BMP2-stimulated invasion, highlighting its role in cell migration and invasion (Hill2012BMP2).

TGFBR3 is also involved in regulating gene expression related to cell adhesion and extracellular matrix (ECM) organization, which are crucial for epicardial cell invasion and coronary vessel formation. Its absence leads to dysregulation of ECM-associated genes, affecting cell interactions with the ECM and resulting in developmental defects (DeLaughter2016Transcriptional).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TGFBR3 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including prostate cancer and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). In prostate cancer, TGFBR3 acts as a tumor suppressor, with its expression significantly reduced in cancerous tissues compared to benign prostate tissue. This reduction is associated with advancing tumor stages and a higher likelihood of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence, suggesting a role in cancer progression. The loss of TGFBR3 expression is linked to mechanisms such as loss of heterozygosity at the TGFBR3 genomic locus and epigenetic changes, including promoter hypermethylation (Turley2007The).

In ccRCC, decreased TGFBR3 expression correlates with poor prognosis and enhanced metastatic abilities. The loss of TGFBR3 contributes to a metastatic phenotype by modulating tumor-forming and cell-migratory abilities through both TGF-β-dependent and independent pathways. Experimental models have shown that silencing TGFBR3 increases tumor progression and metastasis, while its overexpression reduces tumor growth and prolongs survival (Nishida2018Decreased).

TGFBR3 polymorphisms have also been associated with clinical manifestations in sickle cell disease (SCD), influencing lipid profiles and inflammatory responses. Specific haplotypes are linked to increased cholesterol levels and a history of pneumonia, highlighting TGFBR3's potential role in inflammation and disease severity in SCD (Santiago2020Transforming).

## Interactions
TGFBR3, also known as betaglycan, participates in various interactions with other proteins that influence its role in transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling. TGFBR3 interacts with GIPC, a PDZ domain-containing protein, through a Class I PDZ binding motif in its cytoplasmic domain. This interaction regulates the expression of TGFBR3 at the cell surface, enhancing cellular responsiveness to TGF-β (Blobe2001A). GIPC specifically increases the cell surface expression of TGFBR3, which in turn enhances TGF-β-induced gene expression and cellular responses (Blobe2001A).

TGFBR3 also forms complexes with TGFBR2 in the presence of TGF-β, increasing the binding affinity of TGF-β signaling receptors. This interaction is crucial for the high-affinity binding of TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 to receptor II, which is otherwise less effective in cells lacking TGFBR3 (LópezCasillas1993Betaglycan).

In cardiac fibroblasts, TGFBR3 interacts with TGFBR1 and TGFBR2, affecting the formation of TGFBR1-TGFBR2 complexes and modulating downstream signaling molecules like p-Smad2/3. This interaction plays a role in preventing hypoxia-induced apoptosis by inhibiting pro-apoptotic pathways (Chu2011TGFBR3). TGFBR3 also binds to β-arrestin2, which is involved in the internalization and downregulation of TGF-β signaling (DeLaughter2016Transcriptional).
