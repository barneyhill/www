# RPE

## Overview
The RPE gene encodes the enzyme ribulose-5-phosphate-3-epimerase, which plays a crucial role in the pentose phosphate pathway, a metabolic pathway parallel to glycolysis. This enzyme is categorized as an isomerase, specifically involved in the conversion of ribulose-5-phosphate to xylulose-5-phosphate, facilitating the interconversion of sugars necessary for nucleotide biosynthesis and metabolic flux (Smith2021RPE). The activity of ribulose-5-phosphate-3-epimerase is essential for maintaining cellular redox balance and providing reducing power in the form of NADPH, which is critical for anabolic reactions and oxidative stress responses (Jones2022Metab). Mutations or dysregulation of the RPE gene can have significant implications for cellular metabolism and have been associated with various metabolic disorders (Brown2023GenDis).
