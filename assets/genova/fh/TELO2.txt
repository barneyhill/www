# TELO2

## Overview
TELO2 is a gene that encodes the telomere maintenance 2 protein, which is a crucial component of the Tel2-Tti1-Tti2 (TTT) complex. This complex plays a significant role in the stability and function of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases (PIKKs), which are vital for various cellular processes, including DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and mRNA surveillance. The telomere maintenance 2 protein is characterized by HEAT repeat domains that facilitate its interactions within the TTT complex, contributing to the stabilization of PIKKs such as ATM, ATR, and mTOR. These interactions are essential for maintaining genome stability and proper cellular function. The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its cellular localization and function. Mutations in the TELO2 gene have been linked to You-Hoover-Fong syndrome, a disorder with severe developmental and neurological impairments, and its dysregulation is implicated in cancer progression (Bhadra2023TTT; Zhao2023Novel; Guo2020TELO2; Takai2007Tel2).

## Structure
The TELO2 protein is a component of the TTT complex, which includes TTI1 and TTI2, and is involved in the stability and function of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases (PIKKs). The molecular structure of TELO2 is characterized by HEAT repeat domains, which are elongated helical structures that fold into an α-solenoid configuration. These repeats facilitate protein-protein interactions within the TTT complex (Pal2020Structure; Bhadra2023TTT).

TELO2 consists of two main domains: the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the C-terminal domain (CTD), connected by a flexible linker of approximately 50 amino acids. The NTD of TELO2 interacts extensively with TTI1, forming a substantial interface, while the CTD is less visible in structural studies, suggesting a dynamic position within the complex (Pal2020Structure; Bhadra2023TTT).

Post-translational modifications of TELO2 include phosphorylation by Casein Kinase 2 at serine residues 487 and 491, which is crucial for its interaction with the R2TP complex and the stability of PIKKs (Bhadra2023TTT). The protein's structure and interactions are essential for its role in cellular processes, including DNA damage response and telomere maintenance (Bhadra2023TTT).

## Function
The TELO2 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the Tel2-Tti1-Tti2 (TTT) complex, which is essential for the stability and function of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases (PIKKs) in eukaryotic cells. These kinases, including ATM, ATR, DNA-PKcs, mTOR, SMG1, and TRRAP, play vital roles in DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and mRNA surveillance, contributing to genome stability and cell proliferation (Bhadra2023TTT; Takai2007Tel2). TELO2 interacts with these kinases, preventing their rapid degradation and ensuring their steady-state levels are maintained, which is crucial for the proper functioning of signaling pathways governed by ATM, ATR, and mTOR (Takai2007Tel2).

In healthy human cells, TELO2 is involved in the DNA damage response, where it stabilizes DNA-PKcs and ATM, promoting p53 activation and apoptosis (Bhadra2023TTT). The TTT complex, including TELO2, is also essential for the ATR checkpoint signaling pathway, playing a role in telomere length regulation and cell survival (Bhadra2023TTT). TELO2's activity is regulated by phosphorylation, which affects its distribution between the nucleus and cytoplasm, highlighting its dynamic role in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Bhadra2023TTT).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TELO2 gene are associated with You-Hoover-Fong syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe developmental and neurological impairments. This syndrome is linked to compound heterozygous mutations in the TELO2 gene, leading to symptoms such as intellectual disability, microcephaly, congenital heart defects, and developmental delays (Zhao2023Novel). The syndrome's clinical spectrum can also include movement disorders, sleep abnormalities, and less commonly, cataracts and cleft palate (DelPradoSánchez2020Cataract).

TELO2 mutations can result in varying phenotypes, as seen in cases where individuals with the same genetic variant exhibit different severities of the syndrome. For instance, two sisters with a milder form of TELO2-related syndrome were found to have a homozygous p.Arg609His variant, which resulted in less severe symptoms compared to other reported cases (Ciaccio2021Milder).

Alterations in TELO2 expression levels have been implicated in cancer progression. In colorectal cancer, TELO2 is overexpressed and promotes tumor growth and metastasis by interacting with the mTORC2 complex (Guo2020TELO2). Similarly, in glioblastoma multiforme, TELO2 overexpression is associated with poor survival outcomes and drug resistance, suggesting its role as an oncogene (Feng2023Exploring).

## Interactions
The TELO2 protein is a component of the Tel2-Tti1-Tti2 (TTT) complex, which plays a crucial role in the stability and maturation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases (PIKKs) such as ATM, ATR, DNA-PKcs, mTOR, SMG1, and TRRAP. TELO2 interacts with these PIKKs through their HEAT-repeat segments, which are conserved across eukaryotes, suggesting a universal mechanism for PIKK stabilization (Takai2007Tel2). 

TELO2 is also involved in the recruitment of TOR to the R2TP chaperone complex, which includes RUVBL1, RUVBL2, RPAP3, and PIH1D1. This interaction is mediated by a CK2-phosphorylated acidic motif in TELO2, which binds to the PIH domain of PIH1D1, facilitating the stabilization of PIKKs (Pal2020Structure). The TTT complex acts as a co-chaperone with Hsp90, aiding in the maturation of PIKKs, and TELO2's phosphorylation by CK2 enhances its association with the R2TP-Hsp90 complex (Bhadra2023TTT).

In addition to its role in stabilizing PIKKs, TELO2 interacts with other proteins involved in DNA damage response, such as FANCM and FAAP24, to facilitate ATR signaling (Bhadra2023TTT). These interactions highlight TELO2's critical function in maintaining cellular homeostasis and response to stress.
