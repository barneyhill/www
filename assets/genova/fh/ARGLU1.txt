# ARGLU1

## Overview
The ARGLU1 gene encodes the protein arginine and glutamate rich 1, which is characterized by its high content of arginine and glutamate residues. This protein is classified as an 'SR-like' protein due to its serine and arginine-rich repeats, which are crucial for its role in constitutive and alternative splicing (Magomedova2016ARGLU1). ARGLU1 is involved in transcriptional regulation and RNA processing, acting as a coactivator for nuclear receptors such as the glucocorticoid receptor and interacting with the MED1 subunit of the Mediator complex, which is essential for estrogen receptor-mediated gene transcription (Zhang2011Arginine; Magomedova2016ARGLU1). The protein's dual functionality is facilitated by its distinct N-terminal and C-terminal regions, which enable interactions with spliceosomes, RNA, and nuclear receptors (Yao2023Deletion). Clinically, ARGLU1 is implicated in neurological disorders and breast cancer, highlighting its significance in both developmental and oncogenic processes (Zhang2011Arginine; Yao2023Deletion).

## Structure
The ARGLU1 protein is a 273 amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 33 kDa, characterized by its high content of arginine and glutamate residues. It has two distinct regions: an N-terminal region rich in arginine and a C-terminal region rich in glutamate, contributing to its dual functionality in transcriptional regulation and splicing modulation (Zhang2011Arginine; Magomedova2016ARGLU1). The N-terminal region is positively charged, facilitating interactions with spliceosomes and RNA, while the C-terminal region is negatively charged and interacts with nuclear receptors (Zhang2011Arginine; Yao2023Deletion).

ARGLU1 contains a bipartite nuclear localization sequence near the N-terminal end and several serine and arginine (SR)-rich repeats, classifying it as an 'SR-like' protein, which are important in constitutive and alternative splicing (Magomedova2016ARGLU1). The C-terminal domain contains two nonclassical LXXLL motifs, LLXXL and LXXIL, which are canonical interaction sequences found in many nuclear receptor coactivators (Magomedova2016ARGLU1).

The protein is involved in alternative splicing and transcription regulation, with its N-terminal domain responsible for RNA binding, despite the absence of consensus RNA binding motifs (Magomedova2016ARGLU1). ARGLU1 is phosphorylated by SRPK family kinases, which regulate SR proteins important for splicing (Pirnie2016An). The gene expresses at least three distinct RNA splice isoforms, including a fully spliced isoform coding for the protein (Pirnie2016An).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ARGLU1 gene are associated with several neurological and developmental disorders. In humans, mutations in ARGLU1 have been linked to neural developmental disorders, including mental retardation, epilepsy, developmental delay, intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorders (Yao2023Deletion). In mouse models, the deletion of ARGLU1 results in cortical malformations and microcephaly, primarily due to increased apoptosis and defects in alternative splicing, which affect genes involved in neuronal functions (Yao2023Deletion). The study highlights the role of the MDM2/4-p53 axis in these cortical malformations, as the removal of p53 largely rescues the microcephaly caused by ARGLU1 deletion (Yao2023Deletion).

ARGLU1 is also implicated in breast cancer. It is essential for the proliferation and colony formation of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells, such as MCF-7 cells. Knockdown of ARGLU1 significantly diminishes the growth of these cells, indicating its crucial role in breast cancer progression (Zhang2011Arginine). The gene interacts with the MED1 subunit of the Mediator complex, facilitating estrogen receptor-mediated transcription, which is vital for breast cancer cell growth (Zhang2011Arginine). These findings suggest that ARGLU1 plays a significant role in both neurological disorders and cancer.

## Interactions
The ARGLU1 protein, characterized by its high content of arginine and glutamate, is involved in several significant interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It specifically interacts with the MED1 subunit of the Mediator complex, a crucial interaction for estrogen receptor-mediated gene transcription and breast cancer cell growth. This interaction is direct, with the C-terminal region of MED1 binding to the N-terminal arginine-rich region of ARGLU1, facilitating the stabilization of the MED1-Mediator complex on chromatin (Zhang2011Arginine).

ARGLU1 also acts as a coactivator for the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and is involved in alternative splicing. Its C-terminal domain interacts with GR, enhancing transcriptional activity, while the N-terminal domain binds RNA and interacts with splicing factors. ARGLU1 co-purifies with the U2-related spliceosomal complex and binds to specific RNA motifs, indicating its role in splicing regulation (Magomedova2016ARGLU1).

The protein is involved in forming multiprotein complexes with other coactivators like SRC1, TIF2, and PGC1α, which are important for regulating gene expression. These interactions highlight ARGLU1's dual role in transcriptional regulation and RNA processing (Magomedova2016ARGLU1).
