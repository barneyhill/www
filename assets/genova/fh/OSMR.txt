# OSMR

## Overview
The OSMR gene encodes the oncostatin M receptor, a type I cytokine receptor that plays a pivotal role in various cellular signaling pathways. This receptor is part of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor family and is characterized by its complex structure, which includes extracellular, transmembrane, and intracellular domains. The oncostatin M receptor is primarily involved in mediating the effects of cytokines such as oncostatin M and interleukin-31, facilitating critical signaling pathways like JAK/STAT and MAPK that influence cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival (Du2020Molecular; Radtke2006Three). The receptor's function is further modulated by post-translational modifications and the formation of heterodimeric complexes with other receptors, such as the interleukin-31 receptor (Lindberg1998Cloning; Radtke2006Three). OSMR's involvement in diverse biological processes underscores its significance in maintaining cellular and tissue homeostasis, with implications in bone homeostasis, keratinocyte differentiation, and various pathological conditions (Liu2021OSMRβ; Zhou2022Oncostatin).

## Structure
The oncostatin M receptor (OSMR) is a type I cytokine receptor with a complex molecular structure. The protein includes an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain. The extracellular domain is characterized by fibronectin type III-like domains, which are common in cytokine receptors and facilitate ligand binding (Du2020Molecular). The intracellular domain contains motifs crucial for signaling, such as the box 1 and box 2 motifs, which are important for Janus kinase (Jak) binding and subsequent signal transduction (Radtke2006Three).

The OSMR forms a heterodimer with the interleukin-31 receptor (IL-31R) to mediate signaling events. This quaternary structure is essential for its function in cytokine signaling pathways (Radtke2006Three). The receptor's surface expression is regulated by dileucine-like motifs within the interbox1/2 region, which can affect its stability and expression levels (Radtke2006Three).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, contribute to the receptor's heterogeneity and functional regulation (Lindberg1998Cloning). The OSMR gene also produces splice variant isoforms, including a soluble version that acts as an antagonist to block oncostatin M-mediated signaling (Hermanns2015Oncostatin).

## Function
The Oncostatin M receptor (OSMR) is a critical component of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor family, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. OSMR is involved in the differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) and osteoblasts, where it regulates the balance between osteogenesis and adipogenesis. Silencing OSMR enhances osteogenesis and inhibits adipogenesis, while its overexpression has the opposite effect. This regulation is mediated through the inactivation of the ERK signaling pathway and suppression of autophagy, with OSMR influencing the levels of phosphorylated SHC1 and ERK1/2, as well as autophagy-related proteins like ULK1 and Beclin1 (Zhou2022Oncostatin).

OSMR also plays a role in osteoclast differentiation by stimulating RANKL production, and its absence leads to an osteopetrotic phenotype due to impaired osteoclast formation (Zhou2022Oncostatin). In addition to its role in bone homeostasis, OSMR is involved in keratinocyte differentiation, where mutations in the OSMR gene can enhance differentiation and proliferation, as observed in primary localized cutaneous amyloidosis (Liu2021OSMRβ). OSMR's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular and tissue homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the OSMR gene have been implicated in several diseases. In familial primary localized cutaneous amyloidosis (FPLCA), mutations in the OSMR gene, such as p.G618A and p.I691T, disrupt normal signaling pathways, leading to reduced activation of Jak/STAT, MAPK, and PI3K/Akt pathways. This results in increased keratinocyte apoptosis and contributes to the disease's characteristic skin itching and amyloid deposition (Arita2008Oncostatin).

OSMR is also associated with Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis (HAEC), where a specific SNP, rs34675408, results in a missense variant p.H187Q. This variant affects downstream signaling pathways, increasing susceptibility to HAEC by altering immune response pathways and gut homeostasis (Bachetti2021The).

In colorectal cancer, OSMR is frequently methylated, leading to its silencing. This methylation is associated with resistance to growth inhibition by Oncostatin M, suggesting a suppressive role of OSMR in colon cancer progression. The methylation status of OSMR can serve as a potential diagnostic biomarker for colorectal cancer (Kim2009Promoter).

OSMR deficiency has been shown to exacerbate cardiac hypertrophy induced by pressure overload, leading to increased cardiac dysfunction and fibrotic remodeling. This is linked to altered macrophage polarization and activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway (Feng2023OSMR).

## Interactions
The Oncostatin M receptor (OSMR) is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of signaling pathways and cellular functions. OSMR forms a receptor complex with the interleukin-6 signal transducer (gp130) to mediate signaling, specifically interacting with cytokines like oncostatin M (OSM) and interleukin-31. This interaction is crucial for activating pathways such as JAK/STAT and MAPK, which influence cell proliferation and differentiation (AdrianSegarra2018The).

In glioblastoma, OSMR interacts with mitochondrial proteins, including components of the electron transport chain (ETC) such as NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase 1/2 (NDUFS1/2) of complex I. These interactions are essential for regulating oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial respiration, contributing to the resistance of glioma stem cells to ionizing radiation (Sharanek2020OSMR).

OSMR also plays a role in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, where it is expressed in inflammatory cancer-associated fibroblasts. The interaction between OSM and OSMR in this context promotes tumor growth and metastasis by reprogramming fibroblasts and engaging signaling pathways like MEK-MAPK, JAK-STAT, and PI3K-AKT (Lee2021Heterocellular).
