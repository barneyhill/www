# FAM171A2

## Overview
FAM171A2 is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 171 member A2. This protein is characterized by its involvement in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. FAM171A2 is part of a larger family of proteins that share sequence similarities, suggesting potential roles in cellular signaling or structural functions. The protein encoded by FAM171A2 is not currently categorized as a kinase, receptor, or transmembrane protein, indicating that it may have unique or specialized roles within the cell. Research into FAM171A2 has begun to uncover its interactions with other proteins, which may provide insights into its functional significance in health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
