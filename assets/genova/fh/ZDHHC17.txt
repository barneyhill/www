# ZDHHC17

## Overview
ZDHHC17 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger DHHC-type palmitoyltransferase 17, a protein primarily involved in the post-translational modification of other proteins through S-palmitoylation. This enzyme is categorized as a palmitoyltransferase and is crucial for the regulation of protein localization, stability, and function within cells, particularly in the nervous system. The protein is characterized by its ankyrin repeat domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions, and a cysteine-rich DHHC domain essential for its enzymatic activity. ZDHHC17 is predominantly localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it modifies various neuronal proteins, playing a significant role in synaptic function and neuronal signaling. The gene's mutations and alterations have been linked to several neurological disorders, including Huntington's disease and schizophrenia, highlighting its clinical significance in neurodevelopment and neurodegenerative diseases (poblete2020role; Lemonidis2015Identification; Butler2023Sacylation).

## Structure
ZDHHC17 is a protein characterized by its unique molecular structure, which includes several key domains. The protein contains six transmembrane domains (TMDs) that form a cavity structure, allowing the binding of fatty acyl chains (Liao2024The). The N-terminal region of ZDHHC17 features an ankyrin repeat domain, consisting of seven ankyrin repeats, each made up of approximately 33 amino acids forming two alpha helices separated by loops (Butler2023Sacylation). These ankyrin repeats are crucial for protein-protein interactions, particularly with substrates like SNAP25, where specific motifs such as [VI]XXQP are recognized (Lemonidis2015Identification).

The protein also contains a cysteine-rich domain (CRD), known as the DHHC domain, which is essential for its enzymatic activity. This domain includes conserved cysteine and histidine residues that are crucial for catalytic reactions, forming a tetrahedral coordination environment for Zn2+ ions, which are necessary for structural integrity (Liao2024The; Gadalla2019Toward). The DHHC domain is involved in the palmitoylation process, a post-translational modification that ZDHHC17 catalyzes (Rana2018The).

ZDHHC17 may exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can affect its structure and function (Gadalla2019Toward). The protein is primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it performs its enzymatic functions (Gadalla2019Toward).

## Function
ZDHHC17 encodes a palmitoyltransferase enzyme that plays a crucial role in the post-translational modification of proteins through S-palmitoylation, a process that attaches palmitic acid to cysteine residues. This modification is essential for regulating protein localization, stability, and function within cells. ZDHHC17 is primarily active in the Golgi apparatus, where it facilitates the palmitoylation of various neuronal proteins, including SNAP25, PSD-95, GAD65, synaptotagmin I, and huntingtin, which are critical for synaptic function and neuronal signaling (Liao2024The; Korycka2012Human).

In healthy human cells, ZDHHC17 is involved in the regulation of axon outgrowth and neuronal differentiation. It is essential for the proper formation of the TrkA-tubulin complex, which is crucial for axonal growth and branching, independent of its palmitoyltransferase activity (Shi2015ZDHHC17). ZDHHC17 also plays a role in maintaining axonal integrity and synaptic signaling by palmitoylating proteins such as ankyrin-B and δ-catenin, which are important for neural signaling and synaptic plasticity (Liao2024The).

The enzyme's activity is regulated by its ankyrin-repeat domains, which aid in substrate recognition, and it is involved in magnesium transport, classifying it as a 'chanzyme' with both transport and enzymatic functions (Korycka2012Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ZDHHC17 gene, also known as HIP14, have been implicated in several neurological disorders. ZDHHC17 is linked to Huntington's disease (HD) due to its interaction with the huntingtin (HTT) protein. In HD, the expansion of the polyglutamine tract in HTT reduces its binding to ZDHHC17, leading to disrupted palmitoylation and the accumulation of insoluble protein aggregates characteristic of the disease (poblete2020role; Salaun2020Accessory). 

ZDHHC17 is also associated with schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders. The deletion of this gene in mice results in synaptic and behavioral deficits, including motor coordination issues and anxiety-like behaviors, which are indicative of striatal dysfunction (Sanders2016Sudden). 

Additionally, ZDHHC17 has been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders such as Tourette's syndrome, ADHD, and autism spectrum disorders. A rare nonsynonymous variant in ZDHHC17 has been identified in individuals with these conditions, suggesting its significant role in neurodevelopment (Cao2021Wholeexome). 

Overall, the clinical significance of ZDHHC17 is underscored by its involvement in critical neuronal processes and its association with various neurological and psychiatric conditions.

## Interactions
ZDHHC17, a Golgi-localized neuronal S-acyltransferase, interacts with a variety of proteins through its ankyrin repeat (AR) domain, which is crucial for substrate recruitment. This domain recognizes a specific sequence motif, ⌿␤XXQP, found in several proteins, including SNAP25, SNAP23, cysteine string protein, Huntingtin, and microtubule-associated protein 6 (Lemonidis2015Identification). The AR domain of ZDHHC17 is a known protein-protein interaction module, allowing it to engage in numerous interactions with various proteins, facilitated by the flexibility and intrinsic disorder of these sequences (Lemonidis2015Identification).

ZDHHC17 also interacts with proteins from the Sprouty (Spry) and SPRED families, such as Spry2 and SPRED3. These interactions involve novel modes of enzyme-substrate interaction that do not always require the typical zDABM sequence (Butler2023Sacylation). The enzyme is known to S-acylate the Huntingtin protein (HTT) and cysteine string protein α (CSPα), which are involved in neurodegenerative disorders (Butler2023Sacylation). The BioGRID database lists 295 proteins that interact with human ZDHHC17, highlighting its role as a hub for numerous protein interactions (Butler2023Sacylation).
