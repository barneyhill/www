# MPP2

## Overview
MPP2 (MAGUK p55 scaffold protein 2) is a gene that encodes a synaptic scaffold protein belonging to the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family. The protein encoded by MPP2 is characterized by its modular structure, which includes L27, PDZ, SH3, HOOK, and guanylate kinase (GK) domains, facilitating its role in protein-protein interactions at the postsynaptic density (PSD) (Rademacher2016MPP2; Kim2016Membrane). As a scaffold protein, MAGUK p55 scaffold protein 2 is integral to the structural and functional organization of synapses, interacting with key synaptic components such as PSD-95 and SynCAM1 to modulate synaptic adhesion and signaling (Rademacher2016MPP2). Additionally, MPP2 is involved in synaptic plasticity and the stabilization of synaptic channels, contributing to the dynamic regulation of synaptic function (Kim2016Membrane). Alterations in the MPP2 gene have been linked to various clinical conditions, including Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease and colorectal cancer, highlighting its significance in both neurological and oncological contexts (Yang2024Effect; Liu2023A).

## Structure
MPP2 (MAGUK p55 scaffold protein 2) is a synaptic scaffold protein characterized by its modular structure, which includes several distinct protein-protein interaction domains. The protein comprises two N-terminal L27 domains, a single PDZ domain, and SH3-HOOK-GK domains, which are typical of the MAGUK family (Rademacher2016MPP2; Kim2016Membrane). These domains facilitate interactions with various synaptic proteins, allowing MPP2 to function as a scaffold molecule at the postsynaptic density (PSD) (Rademacher2016MPP2).

The PDZ domain of MPP2 is involved in binding to the C-terminus of the synaptic cell adhesion molecule SynCAM1, with a dissociation constant (K_d) of 3.1 μM, indicating a specific interaction (Rademacher2016MPP2). The SH3-GK domains are crucial for scaffold complex formation, although the GK domain is an inactive guanylate kinase that has evolved into a protein interaction domain (Schmerl2020The).

MPP2 is capable of homomultimerization, suggesting potential direct intermolecular interactions (Rademacher2016MPP2). It does not interact directly with AMPA receptor subunits but binds to the C-terminus of SynCAM1, indicating a role in modulating synaptic cell adhesion properties and synapse formation (Rademacher2016MPP2).

## Function
MPP2 (MAGUK p55 scaffold protein 2) is a postsynaptic scaffold protein that plays a significant role in the structural and functional organization of synapses. It is primarily localized at postsynaptic sites in neurons, where it interacts with key components of the postsynaptic density (PSD), such as PSD-95 and GKAP, through its SH3 and GUK domains (Rademacher2016MPP2; Chytła2020Not). MPP2 serves as a bridge linking SynCAM1 cell adhesion molecules to these core components, facilitating synaptic adhesion and signaling (Rademacher2016MPP2).

In addition to its role in synaptic organization, MPP2 is involved in the modulation of synaptic plasticity. It influences the synaptic expression and function of AMPA receptors, although it does not directly interact with AMPA receptor subunits (Rademacher2016MPP2). MPP2 also interacts with SK2-containing channels, which are crucial for synaptic signaling and plasticity, by stabilizing their synaptic localization (Kim2016Membrane).

MPP2's ability to form homomultimers through its L27 domains contributes to its function as a scaffold protein, organizing protein complexes at the synapse and maintaining cell polarity and adhesion (Rademacher2016MPP2; Chytła2020Not).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MPP2 gene have been implicated in several diseases. A de novo missense mutation, p.K315N, in the MPP2 gene is associated with an increased risk of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease, a noninfectious uveitis that can lead to blindness. This mutation exacerbates inflammatory responses and disrupts the barrier functions in retinal pigment epithelial cells, potentially through the ANXA2/ERK3/IL-17E pathway. The mutation is highly deleterious and rare, suggesting a significant role in the genetic susceptibility to VKH disease (Liu2023A).

In colorectal cancer, MPP2 expression is significantly lower in malignant tumors compared to normal tissues. Lower MPP2 expression is linked to poor prognosis and reduced overall survival in colorectal cancer patients. The study identifies MPP2 as an independent prognostic risk factor, with its expression negatively correlated with DNA methylation. Specific CpG sites affecting MPP2 mRNA expression are associated with patient prognosis. MPP2 expression also correlates with immune cell infiltration and the expression of immune checkpoint genes, suggesting its involvement in cancer development through various signaling pathways (Yang2024Effect).

## Interactions
MPP2 (MAGUK p55 scaffold protein 2) is a synaptic scaffold protein that participates in various interactions with other proteins, playing a crucial role in the organization of the postsynaptic density (PSD). MPP2 interacts with PSD-95, a major postsynaptic density protein, through its SH3 and GUK domains, forming a direct cytosolic scaffold interaction (Rademacher2016MPP2; Chytła2020Not). It also binds to GKAP, another key component of the PSD, through a similar mechanism involving its SH3-GK domains (Rademacher2016MPP2).

MPP2 is involved in linking SynCAM1, a synaptic cell adhesion molecule, to core components of the PSD. This interaction is mediated by the PDZ domain of MPP2 binding to the C-terminus of SynCAM1 (Rademacher2016MPP2). MPP2 also interacts with SK2-containing channels, essential for synaptic function, through its SH3-HOOK-GK domain, stabilizing these channels in the PSD (Kim2016Membrane).

These interactions highlight MPP2's role as a scaffold protein, linking cell adhesion molecules and synaptic channels to the structural framework of the PSD, thereby influencing synaptic signaling and plasticity.
