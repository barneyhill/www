# TBK1

## Overview
The TBK1 gene encodes TANK binding kinase 1, a serine/threonine-protein kinase that plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including innate immunity, autophagy, and inflammation. As a kinase, TBK1 is involved in the phosphorylation of key proteins that regulate immune responses and cellular homeostasis. The protein is integral to the antiviral defense mechanism, particularly through its involvement in the cGAS-STING pathway, which links immune signaling with autophagic processes (Revach2020Targeting; Herhaus2021TBK1). Mutations in the TBK1 gene have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), highlighting its clinical significance (Ranganathan2020Multifaceted; Freischmidt2015Haploinsufficiency). The multifaceted roles of TBK1 underscore its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal health.

## Structure
The TBK1 protein, encoded by the TBK1 gene, is a serine/threonine-protein kinase involved in various cellular processes, including innate immunity and autophagy. The protein is composed of 729 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 82-84 kDa (Revach2020Targeting; Papageorgiou2023An). TBK1's primary structure includes several key domains: an N-terminal kinase domain (KD) spanning residues 9-301, a ubiquitin-like domain (ULD) from residues 305-383, and a domain with elongated helices (ED) from residues 407-729, which includes two coiled-coil domains, CCD1 and CCD2 (Ye2019Effects; Papageorgiou2023An).

The secondary structure of TBK1 features a β-grasp fold in the ULD, similar to ubiquitin, with five β strands packed against an α helix (Li2012Crystal). The ULD contains a conserved hydrophobic core and a hydrophobic patch analogous to the Ile44 patch in ubiquitin, which is involved in protein-protein interactions (Li2012Crystal).

TBK1 typically forms homodimers or heterodimers, facilitated by interactions in the scaffold/dimerization domain (SDD) and other domains, contributing to its quaternary structure (Ye2019Effects; Revach2020Targeting). Activation of TBK1 involves phosphorylation at serine residue 172 and polyubiquitination at lysine residues 30 and 401, which are crucial for its function (Revach2020Targeting; Papageorgiou2023An).

## Function
TBK1 (TANK binding kinase 1) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including autophagy, immune response, and inflammation. In healthy human cells, TBK1 is involved in the regulation of autophagy, a process essential for degrading and recycling cellular components. It interacts with mTOR, a central regulator of cell metabolism, to modulate autophagy by phosphorylating RAPTOR, thereby promoting autophagy under certain conditions (Herhaus2021TBK1). TBK1 also facilitates mitophagy, the selective removal of damaged mitochondria, by phosphorylating mitophagy receptors such as OPTN and p62, which aids in recruiting autophagic machinery to the mitochondria (Herhaus2021TBK1).

TBK1 is integral to the immune response, particularly in antiviral defense. It is activated by pattern recognition receptors that detect pathogen components, leading to the activation of transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7, which induce the expression of type I interferons and other cytokines (Revach2020Targeting). TBK1's involvement in the cGAS-STING pathway further underscores its role in immune signaling, linking autophagy with immune responses (Herhaus2021TBK1). Through these functions, TBK1 maintains cellular homeostasis and contributes to the organism's defense mechanisms.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TBK1 gene are associated with several neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). These mutations can be loss-of-function (LoF) or missense variants, both of which have been linked to an increased risk of ALS and FTD. LoF mutations, such as frameshifts and nonsense mutations, are particularly pathogenic and have been found in approximately 1.0% of ALS and/or FTD cases, with a higher prevalence in European populations compared to Asian populations (Ranganathan2020Multifaceted; Freischmidt2015Haploinsufficiency). Missense mutations, while less certain in their pathogenicity, can also impair TBK1's function by disrupting its interactions with adaptor proteins like optineurin, which is crucial for TBK1 activation (Freischmidt2015Haploinsufficiency).

TBK1 mutations are also implicated in other conditions such as progressive bulbar palsy, primary progressive aphasia, and early-onset Alzheimer's disease (Weinreich2019Neuropathological). The gene's role in autophagy and innate immunity suggests that its dysfunction can lead to a variety of clinical phenotypes, with variable age of onset and progression rates (Lamb2019A; Swift2021Variable). The presence of TBK1 mutations alongside other ALS-related gene mutations supports an oligogenic model of pathogenesis, indicating that multiple genetic factors may contribute to disease development (Lattante2019Coexistence; Liu2021TBK1).

## Interactions
TBK1 (TANK-binding kinase 1) is a serine/threonine-protein kinase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including innate immunity and autophagy. It interacts with several adaptor proteins, forming multiprotein complexes essential for its function. TBK1 binds to adaptor proteins such as OPTN (optineurin) and NAP1, with a binding stoichiometry of 1:2 for TBK1 CTD (C-terminal domain) and OPTN. Mutations in these proteins, like OPTN E50K and TBK1 E696K, can affect their interaction and co-localization, which is significant in the context of neurodegenerative diseases (Li2016Structural).

TBK1 also interacts with other adaptors, including TANK, SINTBAD, and NAP1, through a TBK1-binding domain (TBD) that is crucial for antiviral signaling pathways. These interactions are competitive, as TBK1 uses the same residues to form complexes with different adaptors (Ryzhakov2007SINTBAD; Li2016Structural).

In the context of innate immunity, TBK1 interacts with proteins such as STING and MDA5, forming complexes that are essential for the antiviral response. The interaction with STING is particularly important for the activation of IRF3 and IRF7, which are critical for cytokine production in response to viral infections (Zhou2020TBK1; Shang2018Quantitative).
