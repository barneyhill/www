# TP53TG3

## Overview
TP53TG3 is a gene located on chromosome 16 that is primarily expressed in the testis and is regulated by the tumor suppressor protein p53. The gene encodes the protein TP53 target 3, which is involved in critical cellular processes such as apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and DNA repair, thereby contributing to genomic stability and the prevention of tumorigenesis. The protein is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it participates in molecular mechanisms that regulate these processes. TP53TG3 expression is modulated by interactions between proteins such as SETDB1 and PCDHA4, with the latter binding to both SETDB1 and TP53, influencing TP53TG3 expression. This regulatory mechanism underscores the gene's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in cancer biology (Sun2010Identification; Dozmorov2009Unique).

## Function
The TP53TG3 gene, located on the short arm of chromosome 16, is primarily expressed in the testis and is regulated in a TP53-dependent manner (Sun2010Identification). It produces several transcripts through alternative splicing, with the major ones being TP53TG3A and TP53TG3B, encoding peptides of 124 and 132 amino acids, respectively (Sun2010Identification). The protein product of TP53TG3 is involved in cellular processes such as apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and DNA repair, contributing to maintaining genomic stability and preventing tumorigenesis. It is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it plays a role in the molecular mechanisms that regulate these processes (Sun2010Identification).

The expression of TP53TG3 is influenced by the interaction between the CNV pairs CNP10140 (SETDB1) and CNP865 (PCDHA4), where the protein product of PCDHA4 binds to both SETDB1 and TP53 proteins, affecting TP53TG3 gene expression (Sun2010Identification). This interaction suggests a mechanism by which SETDB1 and PCDHA4 modulate TP53TG3 expression through PCDHA4's binding with TP53, which is known to induce TP53TG3 expression (Sun2010Identification).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
TP53TG3, a gene regulated by the tumor suppressor protein p53, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its expression and function. Notably, TP53TG3 expression is significantly associated with the interaction between the proteins SETDB1 and PCDHA4. The protein product of PCDHA4 binds to both SETDB1 and TP53 proteins, which affects TP53TG3 gene expression. This interaction is crucial as PCDHA4's binding with TP53 induces TP53TG3 expression, suggesting a complex regulatory mechanism involving these proteins (Sun2010Identification).

The study by Sun and Kardia (2010) identified a significant epistatic interaction between copy number variation (CNV) pairs associated with TP53TG3 gene expression. Specifically, the CNV pair CNP865 (PCDHA4) and CNP10140 (SETDB1) showed the most significant association with TP53TG3 expression, with a P-value of 1.98 × 10^-220, highlighting the potential impact of CNV interactions on gene expression (Sun2010Identification).

In prostate cancer cell lines, transcription regulatory networks involving Tal-α:E47 and Tal-β:E47 heterodimers have multiple transcription regulatory element sequences in the TP53TG3 gene, indicating a role in its regulation (Dozmorov2009Unique).
