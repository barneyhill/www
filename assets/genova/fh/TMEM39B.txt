# TMEM39B

## Overview
TMEM39B is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 39B, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including autophagy and immune regulation. TMEM39B has been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS-1) and is overexpressed in certain lymphoid malignancies, suggesting a role in immune cell proliferation and survival (Berger2021Transcriptional). Additionally, TMEM39B interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 ORF9C protein, indicating a potential involvement in viral processes (Zhang2021The). Despite these associations, the precise biological functions and interaction networks of TMEM39B remain to be fully elucidated, necessitating further research to understand its role in health and disease.

## Clinical Significance
TMEM39B has been implicated in several clinical contexts, particularly in autoimmune and lymphoid conditions. In patients with autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS-1), TMEM39B is differentially expressed, with a noted increase in expression levels. This alteration suggests a potential involvement in the disease, although the exact consequences of this increased expression remain unclear (Berger2021Transcriptional). The gene is also overexpressed in lymphoid malignancies, indicating a possible role in lymphocytic cellular growth and survival (Berger2021Transcriptional).

TMEM39B has been found to interact with the SARS-CoV-2 ORF9C protein, which localizes to ER-derived vesicles. However, the clinical implications of this interaction are not yet fully understood (Zhang2021The). Despite these associations, there is no direct evidence linking TMEM39B mutations to specific diseases or conditions beyond its altered expression in APS-1 patients (Berger2021Transcriptional). Further research is needed to elucidate the role of TMEM39B in these and potentially other conditions, as well as its involvement in autophagy and other cellular processes (Berger2021Transcriptional).

## Interactions
TMEM39B is known to interact with the SARS-CoV-2 ORF9C protein, which localizes to ER-derived vesicles, suggesting a potential role in viral processes (Zhang2021The). In the context of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS-1), TMEM39B is differentially expressed in regulatory T cells, although specific protein interactions in this setting are not detailed (Berger2021Transcriptional). The protein is implicated in autophagy, potentially influencing the spatial localization and synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, which may involve interactions with other proteins or complexes related to autophagy pathways (Berger2021Transcriptional). However, the exact nature of these interactions remains to be fully elucidated. TMEM39B is also highly expressed in lymphoid malignancies, indicating a possible role in lymphocytic cellular growth and survival, which could involve interactions with proteins that regulate cell proliferation and survival (Berger2021Transcriptional). While these findings suggest various potential interactions, specific details on the physical interactions of TMEM39B with other proteins or nucleic acids are limited, highlighting the need for further research to clarify its interaction network.
