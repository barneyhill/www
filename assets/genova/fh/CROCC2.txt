# CROCC2

## Overview
CROCC2 is a gene that encodes the protein ciliary rootlet coiled-coil, rootletin family member 2, which is integral to the structural and functional organization of cilia in human cells. This protein is characterized by its extensive coiled-coil domains, which facilitate the formation of filamentous rootlets that provide structural support by linking cilia to the cytoskeleton. CROCC2 is predominantly expressed in multiciliated cells, where it plays a crucial role in the coordination of motile cilia, essential for processes such as mucociliary clearance in the respiratory epithelium (Vijayakumaran20243D). The protein's involvement extends to mitochondrial positioning and cellular energy dynamics, highlighting its multifaceted role in cell function (Vijayakumaran20243D). Additionally, CROCC2 has clinical significance as a prognostic biomarker in ovarian serous cancer and is implicated in autoimmune conditions, further underscoring its importance in human health and disease (Wang2021Identification; Vazquez2022Autoantibody).

## Structure
The CROCC2 gene encodes a large protein primarily composed of coiled-coil domains, which are structural motifs that form alpha-helices through hydrophobic interactions. These interactions involve the polypeptide chain coiling to bury hydrophobic residues and expose polar side chains. The coiled-coil proteins pair through heptad repeats, denoted as abcdefg, where a and d are hydrophobic residues forming the main 'hydrophobic seam' in dimer formation. The residues e and g flank the hydrophobic seam and contribute to specificity and stability between helices via ionic interactions (Gilbert2021Ciliary).

In cilia, CROCC2 monomers homodimerize to form filamentous rootlets, providing structural support by integrating the cilium with actin filaments (Gilbert2021Ciliary). The protein is large, over 1600 amino acids in cichlids, and its impact on bone biology may relate to the number and integrity of coiled-coil motifs across the protein (Gilbert2021Ciliary). A specific polymorphism, A963V, affects this structural motif, potentially altering protein function and cilia stability. The V allele is predicted to increase stability by re-establishing the heptad repeat, with higher dimerization stability compared to the A allele (Gilbert2021Ciliary). The molecular structure of CROCC2 in humans is not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
CROCC2, a member of the ciliary rootlet coiled-coil rootletin family, plays a significant role in the structural integrity and function of cilia in human cells. The protein encoded by the CROCC2 gene is characterized by extensive coiled-coil domains and is highly expressed in multiciliated cells, suggesting its involvement in ciliary structures (Vijayakumaran20243D). CROCC2 forms a toroid structure near the basal body of cilia, with a short filament extending toward and partly overlapping with CROCC, indicating a potential molecular interaction that contributes to the structural organization of cilia (Vijayakumaran20243D).

In the respiratory epithelium, CROCC2 is implicated in the coordination of motile cilia, which are essential for effective mucociliary clearance. The protein is involved in the mechanotransduction process, forming a supramolecular bridge linking basal bodies to rootlet fibers, which is crucial for the alignment and coordination of ciliary beating (Vijayakumaran20243D). This coordination is vital for maintaining proper respiratory function and preventing infections (Vijayakumaran20243D).

CROCC2 is also suggested to play a role in mitochondrial positioning and metabolic activity within multiciliated cells, indicating its involvement in cellular energy dynamics and overall cell function (Vijayakumaran20243D).

## Clinical Significance
CROCC2 has been identified as a significant prognostic biomarker in ovarian serous cancer (OSC). High expression levels of CROCC2 are associated with poor 3-year mortality outcomes in OSC patients, suggesting its role as a negative prognostic marker. The gene's involvement in the tumor microenvironment and its potential to influence cell signaling pathways, such as the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-a and Wnt pathways, may contribute to its impact on cancer progression (Wang2021Identification).

In the context of autoimmune conditions, CROCC2 has been linked to ciliary and pulmonary autoimmunity. It is expressed in ciliated cells and has been identified as a notable autoantigen in studies of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS1), indicating its potential involvement in mucociliary airway autoreactivity (Vazquez2022Autoantibody).

Additionally, research on craniofacial development has shown that mutations in CROCC2 can lead to craniofacial defects. Studies in zebrafish have demonstrated that mutations in the CROCC2 gene result in altered developmental trajectories of cranial skeletal elements, suggesting a role in early developmental processes potentially unrelated to cilia signaling (Taneyhill2019The).

## Interactions
CROCC2, a protein characterized by extensive coiled-coil domains, is involved in the structural organization of ciliary rootlets. It forms a supramolecular bridge linking basal bodies to rootlet fibers composed of CROCC, suggesting a potential molecular interaction between these proteins (Vijayakumaran20243D). Structural modeling using AlphaFold indicates that CROCC2 can interact with CEP250 and CROCC through the formation of parallel coiled-coil structures, which are crucial for the assembly and function of rootlets (Vijayakumaran20243D). 

Super-resolution imaging experiments have shown that CROCC2 forms a toroid structure near the basal body with a filament extending toward and partly overlapping with CROCC, indicating a direct interaction (Vijayakumaran20243D). In cells lacking basal bodies, CROCC2 accumulates at one end of rootlet fibers, suggesting it may play a role in establishing polarity (Vijayakumaran20243D). 

These interactions are essential for ciliary motility and mechanotransduction, highlighting the role of CROCC2 in the molecular assembly line of ciliary function (Vijayakumaran20243D). However, specific interactions of CROCC2 with nucleic acids are not detailed in the available context.
