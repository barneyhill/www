# OR4K5

## Overview
OR4K5 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily K member 5, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as an olfactory receptor, playing a pivotal role in the detection and transduction of odorant signals within the olfactory epithelium. As a transmembrane receptor, it is involved in the initial steps of olfactory signal recognition, where it interacts with odor molecules and activates intracellular signaling pathways through G-protein coupling. This activation leads to a cascade of events that result in the perception of smell. While primarily associated with olfactory functions, OR4K5 may also participate in other physiological processes, although its roles outside the olfactory system are not yet fully understood (Fessahaye2021Breast; Raka2021Human).

## Function
OR4K5 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. OR4K5 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it plays a crucial role in olfactory signal recognition and transduction (Fessahaye2021Breast).

The protein encoded by OR4K5 is involved in the olfactory transduction pathway, a significant molecular process that includes the interaction with guanine nucleotide-binding proteins. This interaction is essential for the initiation of intracellular signaling cascades that ultimately lead to the perception of odors (Fessahaye2021Breast). The receptor's activation involves a conformational change upon ligand binding, which triggers the dissociation of G-protein subunits and the subsequent activation of downstream signaling pathways, such as those involving cyclic AMP (cAMP) and calcium ions (Raka2021Human).

In addition to its role in olfaction, OR4K5 has been implicated in various physiological processes beyond the olfactory system, although its specific functions in non-olfactory tissues remain to be fully elucidated (Fessahaye2021Breast).
