# TSPYL1

## Overview
TSPYL1 (testis-specific protein, Y-encoded-like 1) is a gene that encodes a member of the TSPY/TSPYL/SET/NAP1 superfamily, which includes proteins characterized by a nucleosome assembly protein (NAP) domain. The protein encoded by TSPYL1, known as TSPY-like 1, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including the regulation of cholesterol metabolism, cell cycle progression, and serotonin transport. It functions as a transcriptional regulator, particularly influencing the expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. TSPY-like 1 is involved in modulating key signaling pathways, impacting metabolic and psychiatric conditions. Mutations in the TSPYL1 gene have been associated with clinical conditions such as sudden infant death with dysgenesis of the testes syndrome (SIDDT) and metabolic disorders, highlighting its significance in human health (Buyse2020Unravelling; Qin2019Dual; Zhu2022Testis).

## Function
TSPYL1 (TSPY-like 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several cellular processes, including the regulation of cholesterol metabolism and cell cycle progression. In healthy human cells, TSPYL1 functions as a transcriptional regulator of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, particularly influencing the expression of CYP1B1 and CYP7A1 through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. TSPYL1 negatively regulates CYP1B1 expression by blocking β-catenin binding to the TCF7L2 transcription factor on the CYP1B1 promoter, which affects cholesterol homeostasis and lipid metabolism (Zhu2022Testis).

TSPYL1 is also implicated in cell cycle regulation. It is part of the TSPY/TSPYL/SET/NAP1 superfamily, which includes proteins with a nucleosome assembly protein (NAP) domain. This domain is involved in nucleosome assembly via histone binding, DNA replication, transcription, and translation. TSPYL1 deficiency leads to prolonged S and G2 phases and reduced cellular proliferation rates, indicating its role in normal cell cycle progression (Buyse2020Unravelling).

In addition to its role in cholesterol metabolism and cell cycle regulation, TSPYL1 is involved in serotonin transport and the metabolism of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), influencing the expression of the serotonin transporter gene SLC6A4 (Qin2019Dual).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TSPYL1 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. One significant association is with sudden infant death with dysgenesis of the testes syndrome (SIDDT), a rare genetic disorder characterized by sudden infant death due to cardiac and respiratory arrest, along with testicular dysgenesis in males. This condition has been linked to homozygous frameshift mutations in TSPYL1, which result in a truncated protein that mislocalizes to the cytoplasm instead of the nucleus, disrupting normal cellular functions (Buyse2020Unravelling; Lau2007THE).

TSPYL1 is also implicated in metabolic conditions. Altered expression of TSPYL1 affects the regulation of cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP1B1, through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This regulation is crucial for cholesterol metabolism and has been associated with obesity and altered lipid metabolism. Clinical studies have shown that hepatic TSPYL1 expression is negatively correlated with plasma LDL-cholesterol levels and body mass index in obese patients (Zhu2022Testis).

In the context of major depressive disorder (MDD), specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TSPYL1, such as rs3828743, have been associated with the metabolism of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and the severity of depression. These genetic variations may influence treatment outcomes and the baseline severity of depression in patients with MDD (Qin2019Dual).

## Interactions
TSPYL1 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It is known to interact with proteins involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, such as β-catenin. TSPYL1 competes with TCF7L2 for binding to β-catenin, thereby reducing Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity. This interaction suggests that TSPYL1 acts as a negative regulator of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, influencing the expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes like CYP1B1 (Zhu2022Testis).

TSPYL1 also binds to the promoter region of CYP1B1, potentially affecting the interaction between TCF7L2 and β-catenin, which further modulates cholesterol metabolism (Zhu2022Testis). In addition to its role in cholesterol metabolism, TSPYL1 is involved in serotonin transport regulation by influencing the expression of the serotonin transporter gene SLC6A4. This regulation is mediated through its interaction with other TSPYL family members, such as TSPYL2 and TSPYL4, affecting serotonin levels and the response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in major depressive disorder (Qin2019Dual).

These interactions highlight TSPYL1's role in modulating key signaling pathways and its potential impact on metabolic and psychiatric conditions.
