# RSPH1

## Overview
The RSPH1 gene encodes the radial spoke head component 1 protein, which is a crucial element of the radial spoke head-neck complex in motile cilia. This protein plays a significant role in the structural integrity and function of cilia by contributing to the stability and tethering of the central microtubules within the axoneme, which is essential for effective ciliary motility (Onoufriadis2014Targeted). The RSPH1 protein is part of a heteroheptameric complex that includes other subunits such as Rsph4a, Rsph9, and Rsph3b, forming a symmetric structure that facilitates the characteristic planar waveform of ciliary movement (Meng2024Multiscale). Mutations in the RSPH1 gene are linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a disorder that impairs ciliary function, leading to respiratory and reproductive system complications (Onoufriadis2014Targeted; Aprea2023Pathogenic). The protein's interaction with other radial spoke components is vital for maintaining the structural and functional integrity of cilia, highlighting its importance in cellular motility and signaling (Meng2024Multiscale).

## Structure
The RSPH1 protein is a component of the radial spoke head-neck complex, which plays a crucial role in ciliary motility. The protein is part of a heteroheptameric complex that includes other subunits such as Rsph4a, Rsph9, and Rsph3b. The RS head core complex, which includes RSPH1, forms a two-fold symmetric brake pad-shaped structure (Meng2024Multiscale). The RSPH1 protein contributes to the formation of the RS head-neck complex, which can exist in both monomer and dimer forms. The monomer structure features a compact head portion with two extending RSPH1 arms, composed of two copies of Rsph1/Rsph4a/Rsph9, and Rsph3b attached to one side (Meng2023Highresolution).

The RSPH1 protein is involved in the structural flexibility of the RS head-neck dimer, exhibiting significant conformational flexibility with open-and-close and seesaw-like motions. This flexibility may facilitate the formation of asymmetric planar beat patterns in cilia (Meng2024Multiscale). The protein's interaction with Rsph4a is crucial, as frameshift mutations in the MORN motif of RSPH1 can disrupt this interaction, affecting the stability and formation of the RS head-neck complex (Meng2024Multiscale).

## Function
The RSPH1 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the radial spoke head structure within cilia, which are hair-like organelles on the surface of many cell types. In healthy human cells, RSPH1 is essential for the proper formation and function of the ciliary central microtubular apparatus, contributing to the stability and tethering of the central microtubules within the axoneme (Onoufriadis2014Targeted). This structure is crucial for the planar waveform of ciliary movement, which is important for effective mucociliary clearance in the respiratory tract and other axonemal motility functions (Yin2019Mice; Onoufriadis2014Targeted).

RSPH1 is involved in mechanochemical signal transduction along the axoneme, linking the central pair of microtubules to the peripheral dynein motors, which is vital for directing the waveform and velocity of ciliary beating (Onoufriadis2014Targeted). The protein is present along the entire axonemal length in healthy individuals, indicating its role in maintaining ciliary structure and function (Onoufriadis2014Targeted). RSPH1 also plays a role in sperm flagellum formation, contributing to the production of functional sperm (Onoufriadis2014Targeted).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RSPH1 gene are associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetic disorder characterized by defects in the structure and function of motile cilia. These mutations lead to specific ciliary defects, including the loss of the central pair apparatus, resulting in abnormal ciliary beat patterns and impaired mucociliary clearance. This can cause chronic respiratory infections, neonatal respiratory distress, and other related symptoms such as ear infections and bronchiectasis (Onoufriadis2014Targeted). 

RSPH1 mutations also affect sperm flagella, leading to male infertility due to asthenozoospermia, a condition marked by reduced sperm motility. The absence of RSPH1 from sperm flagella correlates with motility defects, contributing to infertility in affected individuals (Aprea2023Pathogenic). 

In mouse models, deletion of the Rsph1 gene results in a PCD phenotype with reduced mucociliary clearance and structural abnormalities in cilia, similar to those observed in human PCD patients. These mice exhibit a low level of mucociliary clearance, leading to mucus accumulation and potential respiratory complications (Yin2019Mice). 

Overall, RSPH1 mutations disrupt normal ciliary and flagellar function, leading to significant clinical manifestations in both respiratory and reproductive systems.

## Interactions
RSPH1 is a component of the radial spoke head-neck complex in cilia, where it interacts with several other proteins to maintain ciliary structure and function. RSPH1 forms part of the RS head-neck complex, which includes Rsph4a and Rsph9 protomers. These proteins interact with central pair (CP) projections in ependymal cilia, particularly with CP projections 2b/2d, suggesting an elastic RS-CP contact mode due to the intrinsic motions of Rsph1 arms (Meng2024Multiscale). 

RSPH1 is also involved in forming symmetric arms with Rsph4a, and frameshift mutations in the MORN motif of RSPH1 can disrupt its interaction with Rsph4a, affecting the arm formation of the RS head (Meng2024Multiscale). The RS head-neck complex, including RSPH1, can be assembled independently, and RSPH1 is crucial for forming the RS head-neck dimer (Meng2024Multiscale).

In the context of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), mutations in RSPH1 lead to a loss of the radial spoke head structure, affecting the levels of RSPH4A and RSPH9, while the spoke stalk protein ROPN1L remains unaffected (Onoufriadis2014Targeted). This indicates that RSPH1 is essential for the assembly and stability of the radial spoke head.
