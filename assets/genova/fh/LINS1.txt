# LINS1

## Overview
LINS1 is a gene that encodes the protein lines homolog 1, which is involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, a critical regulator of various cellular processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. The LINS1 protein functions as a transcriptional regulator, influencing the expression of target genes within this pathway. It plays a significant role in the development of the central nervous system, particularly in the patterning of the neocortex, which is essential for cognitive functions like learning and memory. Mutations in the LINS1 gene have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability and conditions such as Worster-Drought syndrome, highlighting its importance in human cognition and brain development (Akawi2013LINS; Muthusamy2020A).

## Structure
The LINS1 gene encodes a protein that is 757 amino acids long and contains specific domains crucial for its function. The protein includes two 'lines' homology domains and a LINES_C domain, which spans amino acids 712 to 747 (Muthusamy2020A). A novel nonsense mutation, p.Gln368Ter, results in a truncated protein of 367 amino acids, leading to the loss of the LINES_C domain and a partial loss of the LINES_N domain, which extends from amino acids 194 to 367 (Muthusamy2020A). This mutation also results in the loss of a ubiquitylation site at position Lys407, which is significant for post-translational modification (Muthusamy2020A).

The LINS1 protein is involved in the WNT signaling pathway and plays a role in human cognition (Akawi2013LINS). The mutation identified in the LINS1 gene affects the protein's structure and function, leading to intellectual disability (Muthusamy2020A). The loss of phosphorylation and ubiquitylation sites due to the truncation may significantly impact the protein's function, contributing to the observed phenotype (Muthusamy2020A). The LINS1 gene has seven exons, and the identified mutation affects all protein-coding transcripts available in RefSeq (Muthusamy2020A).

## Function
The LINS1 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is crucial for various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. This pathway is essential for normal cognitive development and brain function (Akawi2013LINS). The LINS1 protein acts as a transcriptional regulator, functioning both as an activator and repressor of downstream target genes. It modulates the Wnt canonical pathway by interacting with components like arm/CTNNB1, influencing the transcription of target genes (Akawi2013LINS).

In humans, the LINS1 protein is involved in the development of the central nervous system, particularly in the regional patterning of the neocortex into defined functional areas, which is crucial for learning, memory, and behavior (Akawi2013LINS). The protein is expressed in the dorsal telencephalon during development, indicating its role in corticogenesis and neurogenesis (Akawi2013LINS). The LINS1 gene's function in humans is inferred from its role in Drosophila, where it is essential for patterning and morphogenesis of various tissues (Akawi2013LINS).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LINS1 gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders, primarily characterized by intellectual disability (ID). LINS1 mutations, such as truncating and frameshift mutations, have been linked to autosomal recessive nonsyndromic intellectual disability (ARID), often accompanied by additional clinical features like microcephaly, delayed speech, epilepsy, and cognitive developmental delay (Muthusamy2020A; Neuhofer2020LINS1). A specific truncating mutation in LINS1 results in the deletion of 389 amino acids in the C-terminus, leading to the loss of functionally important regions, including phosphorylation and ubiquitylation sites, which are crucial for the protein's role in cognition (Muthusamy2020A).

LINS1 is also implicated in the modulation of the Wnt signaling pathway, which is essential for brain development. Mutations affecting this pathway can lead to conditions like primary cervical dystonia and have been observed in families with consanguineous backgrounds, where affected individuals exhibit developmental regression, oculomotor signs, and dystonia (Akawi2013LINS; Neuhofer2020LINS1). Additionally, LINS1 mutations have been associated with Worster-Drought syndrome, a condition characterized by developmental and neurological symptoms, including severe cognitive impairment and expressive language difficulties (McMillan2018WorsterDrought).
