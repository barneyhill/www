# MAPK3

## Overview
MAPK3, also known as ERK1, is a gene that encodes the protein mitogen-activated protein kinase 3, a serine/threonine kinase integral to the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. This protein plays a pivotal role in regulating various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and survival, by transmitting signals from the cell surface to the nucleus (Cargnello2011Activation; Lavoie2020ERK). As a kinase, MAPK3 is activated through phosphorylation by upstream kinases such as MEK1/2, which enables it to phosphorylate a range of substrates, including transcription factors and other proteins involved in cell motility and apoptosis (Lavoie2020ERK). The gene's involvement in critical signaling pathways underscores its significance in both normal cellular function and pathological conditions, such as cancer and diabetes, where its dysregulation can contribute to disease progression (Petrosino2023The; Hayashi2017Hyperglycemia).

## Structure
MAPK3, also known as ERK1, is a serine/threonine kinase involved in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. The primary structure of MAPK3 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the protein chain. Its secondary structure includes conserved α-helices and β-strands, with a small amino-terminal lobe and a large carboxy-terminal lobe. The small lobe features a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and a conserved αC-helix, which can be in active or inactive orientations. A glycine-rich ATP-phosphate binding loop, known as the P-loop, is located between the β1 and β2 strands, aiding in the positioning of ATP phosphates for catalysis (Roskoski2012ERK1/2).

The tertiary structure of MAPK3 is characterized by a three-dimensional conformation stabilized by interactions such as hydrogen bonds. The protein's catalytic core is defined by a K/D/D motif, with key residues playing crucial roles in catalysis and substrate positioning. The activation segment begins with a DFG motif and ends with an APE motif, with specific residues binding Mg2+ ions to coordinate ATP phosphates (Roskoski2012ERK1/2).

MAPK3 often forms a quaternary structure as a dimer. Phosphorylation is a common post-translational modification that regulates its activity, particularly within the activation lip, which contains phosphorylatable residues crucial for kinase activity (Roskoski2012ERK1/2).

## Function
MAPK3, also known as ERK1, is a critical component of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, which regulates various cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and survival. In healthy human cells, MAPK3 is activated by upstream kinases, including MEK1/2, through phosphorylation. Once activated, MAPK3 translocates to the nucleus, where it influences gene expression by phosphorylating transcription factors like Elk-1, which promotes the expression of immediate-early genes such as c-Fos, crucial for cell cycle regulation (Cargnello2011Activation; Lavoie2020ERK).

MAPK3 also plays a role in cell motility by modulating the formation of lamellipodia and actomyosin contractility, which are essential for cell movement. It achieves this by phosphorylating components involved in actin polymerization and focal adhesion turnover (Lavoie2020ERK). Additionally, MAPK3 is involved in regulating apoptosis by phosphorylating and inactivating proapoptotic proteins, thereby promoting cell survival (Lavoie2020ERK).

In terms of cellular metabolism, MAPK3 influences anabolic pathways and interfaces with ATP production mechanisms, affecting the balance between anabolic and catabolic processes (Lavoie2020ERK). These functions highlight MAPK3's role as a master regulator of cell behavior, life, and fate (Lavoie2020ERK).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MAPK3 gene, also known as ERK1, have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer. Cancer-related missense mutations in MAPK3 can affect protein stability and function, leading to changes in the protein's tertiary structure and thermodynamic stability. These mutations can alter the catalytic efficiency of MAPK3, potentially contributing to cancer progression and resistance to treatment (Petrosino2023The). 

In colorectal cancer, the interaction between MAPK3 and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathways has been shown to influence tumor behavior. Phosphorylated MAPK3 expression modifies the prognostic effect of AMPK, with significant implications for cancer-specific survival (Baba2010Prognostic). 

In the context of diabetes, MAPK3 signaling is involved in the proliferation of interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs), which can lead to rapid gastric emptying. This process is significant in hyperglycemic conditions, such as those found in type 2 diabetes, where increased MAPK3 activity contributes to altered gastric motility (Hayashi2017Hyperglycemia). 

MAPK3 has also been studied as a potential prognostic marker for recurrent intracranial meningiomas, suggesting its role in tumor recurrence (Dharmajaya2019Mitogenactivated).

## Interactions
MAPK3, also known as ERK1, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with several key proteins, including MAPK1 and RELA, forming a significant motif involved in apoptosis and psoriasis-related pathways (Farahani2024Integrating). MAPK3 is part of the MAPK/ERK signaling cascade, which regulates keratinocyte proliferation, differentiation, and cytokine production, highlighting its role in psoriasis (Farahani2024Integrating).

In the context of the Ras-MAPK/PI3K signaling pathways, MAPK3 interacts with proteins such as CPXM, FKBP2, and ID2, with varying confidence scores indicating the reliability of these interactions (Wang2008Protein). These interactions suggest MAPK3's involvement in activating transcription factors by binding with their repressor proteins (Wang2008Protein).

MAPK3 is also implicated in the EGF signaling pathway, where it is part of a minimal scaffold involving interactions with proteins like EGFR, GRB2, and SOS1, which are essential for signal transduction (Kirouac2012Creating). Additionally, MAPK3 is involved in the TGF-β signaling pathway, interacting with MAPK1 and playing a role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition in cancer (Nahálková2020Linking).
