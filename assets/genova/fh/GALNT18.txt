# GALNT18

## Overview
GALNT18 is a gene that encodes the enzyme polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 18 (ppGalNAc-T18), a member of the GalNAc-transferase family. This enzyme is categorized as a type II transmembrane protein and is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it plays a non-catalytic role in regulating O-glycosylation and maintaining ER homeostasis (Shan2019Polypeptide; Jia2021Polypeptide). Unlike other members of its family, which are typically found in the Golgi apparatus, ppGalNAc-T18 is unique in its ER localization, where it interacts with ER-resident proteins such as UGGT1, PLOD3, and LPCAT1 (Jia2021Polypeptide). These interactions are crucial for its function in modulating protein folding, stability, and cell signaling, thereby influencing cellular processes and tissue architecture (Nielsen2022Global). The gene has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its potential significance in human health (Wang2021Targeted).

## Structure
The GALNT18 protein, also known as polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 18, is a type II transmembrane protein with a typical primary structure that includes an N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane domain, and a luminal enzymatic domain. The luminal domain is composed of a stem region, catalytic domain, and lectin domain (Jia2021Polypeptide). The catalytic domain contains a GT-A structural motif with Rossmann-like folds, which are characteristic of the GalNAc-transferase family (Bennett2011Control). 

The protein's cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane domain contain signals for ER export and Golgi retention, although GALNT18 is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) due to interactions within its luminal regions (Jia2021Polypeptide). The luminal stem region and catalytic domain are crucial for ER localization, while the lectin domain is not necessary for this function (Jia2021Polypeptide).

GALNT18 is predicted to have three N-glycosylation sites, but N-glycosylation is not required for its ER retention (Shan2019Polypeptide). The protein can dimerize, likely through its N-terminal cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane domain (Jia2021Polypeptide). Splice variants of GALNT18 may exist, potentially affecting substrate preferences, although this has not been confirmed in vivo (May2020Differential).

## Function
GALNT18 encodes the enzyme polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 18 (ppGalNAc-T18), which plays a crucial role in regulating O-glycosylation and maintaining endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis in human cells. Unlike most members of the ppGalNAc-T family that are localized in the Golgi apparatus, ppGalNAc-T18 is primarily found in the ER, where it functions in a non-catalytic manner (Shan2019Polypeptide; Jia2021Polypeptide). This enzyme is involved in the initial step of O-linked glycosylation, a process that attaches N-acetylgalactosamine to serine or threonine residues on proteins, influencing protein folding, stability, and cell signaling (Li2011Characterization).

ppGalNAc-T18 interacts with ER resident proteins such as UGGT1, PLOD3, and LPCAT1, which is essential for its retention in the ER and its function in maintaining ER homeostasis (Jia2021Polypeptide). Knockdown of ppGalNAc-T18 leads to reduced O-glycosylation and triggers apoptosis by activating ER stress, while its overexpression can alleviate ER stress, suggesting its role as a molecular chaperone (Shan2019Polypeptide). The enzyme's unique localization and function highlight its importance in cellular processes, including modulating signal transduction and influencing tissue architecture (Nielsen2022Global).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GALNT18 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. The gene is part of the GT27 family, which has been noted for having a significant number of potentially damaging non-synonymous single nucleotide variants (nsSNVs). Specifically, a rare nsSNV in GALNT18, introducing a stop codon (p.Gln556*), was identified in the Danish population, suggesting a potential impact on enzyme function (Hansen2014A).

GALNT18 has also been prioritized as a novel candidate gene associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). In a study involving a cohort of Chinese patients, GALNT18 was identified based on its functional impact and co-expression with known NDD candidate genes. This suggests a possible role in the pathogenicity of conditions such as autism spectrum disorder (Wang2021Targeted).

Alterations in GALNT18 expression or its interactions may also affect endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis and O-glycosylation processes. Knockdown of GALNT18 has been shown to induce ER stress, indicating its regulatory role in maintaining ER function (Jia2021Polypeptide). However, specific diseases directly linked to GALNT18 mutations or expression changes are not extensively documented in the available literature.

## Interactions
GALNT18, also known as polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 18, interacts with several proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It specifically interacts with the ER-resident proteins UGGT1, PLOD3, and LPCAT1. These interactions are crucial for the localization and function of GALNT18 in the ER, where it plays a role in regulating ER homeostasis and O-glycosylation (Jia2021Polypeptide). The catalytic and lectin domains of GALNT18 are essential for its interaction with UGGT1 and PLOD3, while the CTS domain is important for its interaction with LPCAT1 (Jia2021Polypeptide).

GALNT18 does not interact with other ER quality control factors such as BIP, PDI, calreticulin, and calnexin, indicating a specific interaction profile within the ER (Jia2021Polypeptide). The protein may also dimerize through its N-terminal cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane domain, suggesting a potential mechanism for its retention and function in the ER (Jia2021Polypeptide). These interactions highlight the non-catalytic role of GALNT18 in maintaining ER homeostasis and regulating protein O-glycosylation (Shan2019Polypeptide).
