# ELOVL3

## Overview
ELOVL3, or ELOVL fatty acid elongase 3, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane enzyme involved in the elongation of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs). This enzyme is crucial for the synthesis of C20-C24 saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, which are integral to lipid metabolism, membrane structure, and cell signaling. ELOVL3 is predominantly expressed in tissues such as brown and white adipose tissue, skin sebaceous glands, and the liver, where it contributes to maintaining skin and hair health by regulating the water barrier function. The protein's activity is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it catalyzes the initial step of the fatty acid elongation cycle. Beyond its physiological roles, ELOVL3 has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including skin disorders and cancer, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Wang2023A; Matsuzaka2009Elovl6:; Creasy2023Elongation).

## Function
ELOVL3 (ELOVL fatty acid elongase 3) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the elongation of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs), which are essential components of various cellular processes, including lipid metabolism, membrane structure, and cell signaling (Wang2023A). ELOVL3 is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it catalyzes the first step in the elongation cycle by condensing malonyl-CoA with acyl-CoA substrates (Deák2019Novel). This enzyme is involved in the synthesis of C20-C24 saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, which are incorporated into bioactive lipids like ceramides, influencing cellular growth and differentiation (Creasy2023Elongation).

In healthy human cells, ELOVL3 is expressed in tissues such as brown and white adipose tissue, skin sebaceous glands, and the liver (Creasy2023Elongation). It is involved in maintaining the proper composition of fatty acids necessary for skin and hair health, particularly in regulating the water barrier function (Matsuzaka2009Elovl6:). ELOVL3 also plays a role in cell cycle regulation, as its overexpression can slow cell growth and stall cell cycle progression in the S-phase, suggesting a potential role in inhibiting cellular proliferation (Creasy2023Elongation).

## Clinical Significance
ELOVL3 is implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in fatty acid elongation. Alterations in ELOVL3 expression have been linked to skin disorders. In Elovl3 knockout mice, disruptions in skin barrier function lead to increased transepidermal water loss and skin abnormalities, including hyperplasia of sebaceous glands and hair loss (Deák2019Novel; Zwara2021Alterations). These changes are associated with a decrease in very long-chain fatty acids and an accumulation of shorter chain fatty acids (Zwara2021Alterations).

In humans, a de novo mutation in ELOVL3 has been identified in a child screened for autism spectrum disorders, suggesting potential neurological implications (Zwara2021Alterations). ELOVL3 expression is also altered in epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) patients, indicating its involvement in the pathogenesis of this skin condition (Bchetnia2011Expression).

In cancer biology, ELOVL3 is implicated in prostate cancer progression. Its expression is upregulated by BRG1, which promotes cancer cell migration and invasion through epigenetic modulation (Wang2023A). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ELOVL3 in various diseases, particularly those involving lipid metabolism and skin barrier function.

## Interactions
ELOVL3, a member of the ELOVL family of enzymes, is involved in the elongation of very long-chain fatty acids. In the context of prostate cancer, ELOVL3 is implicated in promoting cancer cell migration and invasion through epigenetic modulation. This process involves the interaction of BRG1 with p300, which leads to the modulation of RORγ-dependent ELOVL3 transcription. This suggests a physical interaction between BRG1 and p300 in the regulation of ELOVL3, highlighting its role in cancer progression (Wang2023A).

In liver cells, the transcription factor ZHX2 regulates the expression of the Elovl3 gene. ZHX2 activates Elovl3 expression by binding to control regions of the Elovl3 gene, as demonstrated in HepG2 cells and mouse models. This interaction indicates a direct regulatory role of ZHX2 on Elovl3 transcription, although specific physical interactions of the ELOVL3 protein with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed (Creasy2023Elongation).

While ELOVL3 is involved in various signaling pathways, such as MAPK, mTOR, and Wnt, specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids in these pathways are not explicitly described (Wang2023A).
