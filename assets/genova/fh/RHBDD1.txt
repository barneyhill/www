# RHBDD1

## Overview
RHBDD1 is a gene that encodes the rhomboid domain-containing protein 1, a type of intramembrane serine protease. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of exosome secretion and apoptosis. It functions by cleaving specific substrates such as the multi-pass transmembrane protein TSAP6, which plays a role in nonclassical exosomal secretion pathways (Wan2012ExosomeRelated). RHBDD1 is also implicated in the modulation of signaling pathways, such as the Wnt and EGFR pathways, which are crucial for cellular communication and cancer progression (Zhang2018RHBDD1; Song2015Rhomboid). The gene's expression and activity have been linked to the development and metastasis of various cancers, including colorectal and non-small cell lung cancer, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Xu2021RHBDD1; Zhang2018RHBDD1).

## Function
RHBDD1 is a rhomboid protease involved in the regulation of exosome secretion in mammalian cells. It functions by cleaving the multi-pass transmembrane protein TSAP6, which is a key component in the nonclassical exosomal secretion pathway. This cleavage is dose- and activity-dependent, occurring primarily in the C-terminal of the third transmembrane domain of TSAP6 (Wan2012ExosomeRelated). The inactivation of RHBDD1 leads to increased levels of TSAP6, resulting in enhanced exosome secretion, as evidenced by elevated levels of exosomal components such as Tsg101 and Tf-R (Wan2012ExosomeRelated). This suggests that RHBDD1 normally acts to restrict TSAP6 levels and thus modulate exosome secretion (Wan2012ExosomeRelated).

RHBDD1 is also involved in apoptosis regulation, particularly in the context of spermatogenesis. In mouse models, the homologous gene mRHBDD1 is crucial for the survival and differentiation of spermatogonia, indicating a role in inhibiting apoptotic activity (Wang2009GC1). The protein is active in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, contributing to protein trafficking and cellular homeostasis. However, the specific functions of RHBDD1 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
RHBDD1 (rhomboid domain containing 1) is implicated in the progression and metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC). Alterations in RHBDD1 expression are associated with increased metastatic potential in CRC, as its expression is positively correlated with both lymphatic and distal metastasis. The gene promotes an aggressive phenotype in CRC cells by activating the Wnt signaling pathway, leading to the upregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin/TCF target gene ZEB1, which is linked to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and a stem-like phenotype in tumor cells (Zhang2018RHBDD1). Inactivation of RHBDD1 in CRC cell lines results in decreased tumor cell growth, indicating its role in promoting tumorigenesis through the EGFR/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway (Song2015Rhomboid).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), RHBDD1 expression is notably upregulated, and its silencing inhibits cell proliferation and invasion while increasing apoptosis. This effect is mediated through the ZEB1/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, suggesting RHBDD1 as a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target for NSCLC (Xu2021RHBDD1). These findings underscore the clinical significance of RHBDD1 in cancer progression and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
RHBDD1, a rhomboid domain-containing protein, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with pro-transforming growth factor alpha (proTGFa), leading to its cleavage and secretion, which activates the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway. This interaction is specific, as RHBDD1 does not interact with other EGFR ligands like EGF or HB-EGF (Song2015Rhomboid). RHBDD1 also interacts with the multi-pass transmembrane protein TSAP6, inducing its proteolysis. This interaction affects exosome secretion, as RHBDD1 inactivation leads to increased TSAP6-mediated exosome release (Wan2012ExosomeRelated).

In the context of colorectal cancer, RHBDD1 is involved in the Wnt signaling pathway by regulating the phosphorylation of β-catenin at specific serine residues (ser552 and ser675). This regulation is crucial for maintaining Wnt signaling activity and promoting cancer cell metastasis (Zhang2018RHBDD1). RHBDD1's interaction with β-catenin influences the expression of ZEB1, a key player in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, further contributing to its role in cancer metastasis (Zhang2018RHBDD1). These interactions highlight RHBDD1's significant role in modulating signaling pathways and cellular processes.
