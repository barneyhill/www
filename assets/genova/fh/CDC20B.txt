# CDC20B

## Overview
CDC20B is a gene that encodes the protein cell division cycle 20B, which is implicated in the regulation of multiciliogenesis, particularly in the production and disengagement of centrioles within multiciliated cells (MCCs). The CDC20B protein is characterized by the presence of WD40 repeats, which are structural motifs that form a β-propeller structure, facilitating protein-protein interactions (Revinski2018CDC20B). Unlike its homologs CDC20 and FZR1, CDC20B does not activate the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) due to the absence of canonical binding domains (Revinski2018CDC20B). Instead, CDC20B interacts with proteins such as PLK1, a mitotic kinase, and SPAG5, playing a crucial role in centriole disengagement and ciliogenesis (Revinski2018CDC20B). These interactions are essential for the release of centrioles from deuterosomes, a process necessary for the formation of motile cilia, highlighting CDC20B's importance in cellular processes and its potential implications in diseases related to ciliary dysfunction (Revinski2018CDC20B).

## Structure
The CDC20B protein is composed of approximately 519 amino acids and is characterized by the presence of seven well-conserved WD40 repeats in its C-terminal half, which are predicted to form a β-propeller structure (Revinski2018CDC20B). These WD40 repeats show 49% and 37% identity to the repeats found in CDC20 and FZR1, respectively, indicating a degree of structural similarity (Revinski2018CDC20B). Despite these similarities, CDC20B lacks the canonical APC/C binding domains, suggesting it does not activate the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) (Revinski2018CDC20B).

CDC20B interacts with PLK1, a mitotic kinase, and SPAG5 (Astrin), which is involved in the activation of Separase during the cell cycle. These interactions suggest a role for CDC20B in centriole disengagement, potentially in cooperation with PLK1 (Revinski2018CDC20B). The presence of CDC20B in complexes with PLK1 and SPAG5 has been confirmed through reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation assays (Revinski2018CDC20B). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, as well as post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms of CDC20B, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The CDC20B gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the process of multiciliogenesis, particularly in the production and disengagement of centrioles in multiciliated cells (MCCs). This protein is essential for centriole release from deuterosomes, a process necessary for the formation of motile cilia in MCCs (Revinski2018CDC20B). CDC20B interacts with several proteins, including PLK1 and SPAG5, which are involved in the regulation of centriole disengagement. PLK1, a mitotic kinase, works alongside the protease Separase to facilitate this process by phosphorylating PCNT, which is then cleaved by Separase, allowing for centriole duplication in the next cell cycle (Revinski2018CDC20B).

CDC20B is located in the perideuterosomal region and is necessary for centriole disengagement, suggesting its involvement in Separase-dependent proteolysis at deuterosomes. This activity is crucial for the release of mature centrioles and subsequent ciliogenesis (Revinski2018CDC20B). The gene is part of a genomic locus associated with multiciliogenesis and is a potential candidate for diseases like reduced generation of multiple motile cilia (RGMC) due to its genomic location (Revinski2018CDC20B). CDC20B's role in these processes highlights its importance in the early stages of multiciliogenesis and its potential impact on cellular and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
CDC20B is involved in several critical interactions within multiciliated cells (MCCs), particularly during centriole disengagement and ciliogenesis. It interacts with PLK1, a kinase that coordinates centriole disengagement, forming a complex that is essential for the release of centrioles from deuterosomes and their conversion into basal bodies necessary for cilia production (Revinski2018CDC20B). CDC20B also interacts with SPAG5, which controls the activation of Separase, a protease involved in centriole disengagement (Revinski2018CDC20B). 

CDC20B is part of a protein complex with DEUP1, which is involved in the assembly of mature deuterosomes, crucial for centriole disengagement (Revinski2018CDC20B). The CDC20B/PLK1/SPAG5 complex is suggested to control the timing of Separase activation, indicating a coordinated role in centriole release (Revinski2018CDC20B). 

CDC20B's interactions are not limited to protein complexes; it is also associated with basal bodies and cilia in mature MCCs, although its presence in cilia is not confirmed in Xenopus (Revinski2018CDC20B). These interactions highlight CDC20B's role in the molecular mechanisms underlying centriole release and cilia formation.
