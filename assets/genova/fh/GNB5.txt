# GNB5

## Overview
The GNB5 gene encodes the G protein subunit beta 5 (Gβ5), a critical component of the G protein signaling pathway. This protein is categorized as a regulatory subunit that interacts with the R7 family of regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins, forming the Gβ5-R7 complex. This complex plays a pivotal role in modulating neurotransmitter signaling, particularly within the central nervous system, by accelerating the inactivation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (Shamseldin2016GNB5). Gβ5 is essential for various physiological processes, including neurobehavioral functions and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (Wang2020The). Mutations in the GNB5 gene are linked to several neurodevelopmental and cardiac disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Sciacca2020Severe).

## Structure
The GNB5 protein is composed of 538 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 60 kDa (Albor1995The). Its primary structure includes five WD-40 repeat motifs, which are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions (Albor1995The). These motifs form a seven-bladed beta-propeller structure, a common feature in proteins that mediate complex interactions (Lodder2016GNB5). The secondary structure of GNB5 likely involves the formation of these beta-propeller structures, typical of WD-40 motifs (Albor1995The).

The tertiary structure of GNB5 involves the folding of these motifs into a stable three-dimensional conformation, although specific details are not provided in the context (Albor1995The). The quaternary structure may involve the assembly of GNB5 with other protein subunits, such as its interaction with the RGS proteins, which are common binding partners (Lodder2016GNB5).

GNB5 is also characterized by a highly acidic amino terminus and a proline-rich domain, contributing to its structural properties (Albor1995The). The protein's structure is crucial for its role in various physiological processes, including its involvement in the Gβ5-R7 complex, which is essential for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (Wang2020The).

## Function
The GNB5 gene encodes the G protein subunit beta 5 (Gβ5), which is integral to the G protein signaling pathway. In healthy human cells, Gβ5 forms complexes with the R7 family of regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins, known as the Gβ5-R7 complex. This complex is crucial for modulating neurotransmitter signaling, particularly in the central nervous system, where it plays a significant role in controlling G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Gβ5 stabilizes RGS protein complexes, which are essential for terminating GPCR signaling by accelerating GTP hydrolysis on the Gα subunits, thus promoting their inactivation and preventing uncontrolled G protein signaling (Shamseldin2016GNB5).

Gβ5 is particularly important in the nervous system for controlling signaling related to learning, motor control, and vision. It is enriched in the brain, especially in the hippocampus and striatum, and is crucial for normal neurobehavioral functions (Shamseldin2016GNB5). Additionally, Gβ5 is involved in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in pancreatic β cells, where it enhances the function of muscarinic cholinergic receptor M3 and other stimuli to promote insulin secretion (Wang2020The). The Gβ5-R7 complex also interacts with components of the SNARE complex, influencing vesicle docking and exocytosis, which are essential for insulin release (Wang2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GNB5 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental and cardiac disorders. The gene is linked to a severe condition known as Infantile Developmental Disorder with Cardiac Arrhythmias (IDDCA), characterized by severe developmental delay, epileptic encephalopathy, retinal dystrophy, and heart rhythm abnormalities. This severe phenotype is typically caused by biallelic loss-of-function mutations in GNB5 (Sciacca2020Severe; Malerba2019Generation). 

A milder form of the disorder, known as Language Delay, ADHD, and Cardiac Arrhythmia (LADCI), is associated with homozygous missense variants in GNB5. This condition presents with language delay, cognitive impairment, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, with or without cardiac arrhythmia (Sciacca2020Severe; Malerba2018A). 

The GNB5 gene is also implicated in a novel neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by severe speech impairment, ADHD, and motor delay. This disorder is linked to a specific missense mutation, p.(Ser81Leu), which affects the stability and function of the Gβ5 protein, leading to impaired neurotransmitter signaling (Shamseldin2016GNB5). 

Overall, GNB5 mutations can lead to a spectrum of clinical presentations, with the severity of the phenotype correlating with the type of genetic variant present (Malerba2018A).

## Interactions
The GNB5 gene encodes the G protein subunit beta 5 (Gβ5), which is involved in various protein interactions crucial for cellular signaling. Gβ5 forms complexes with members of the Regulator of G protein Signaling (RGS) family, particularly the R7 subfamily, which includes RGS6, RGS7, RGS9, and RGS11. These complexes are essential for modulating neurotransmitter signaling and enhancing the GTPase activating protein (GAP) activity of R7 RGS proteins, thereby controlling G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling (Shamseldin2016GNB5).

Gβ5 interacts with G protein-gated inward rectifier potassium (GIRK) channels, facilitating their coupling to GABA B receptors in neurons. This interaction is crucial for neuronal G protein signaling and affects the timing and sensitivity of the GABA B receptor-GIRK signaling pathway (Xie2010Gβ5). In cardiac function, the Rgs6/Gβ5 complex interacts with the cardiac-specific GIRK subunit Girk4, influencing parasympathetic regulation of heart rate (Posokhova2010RGS6Gβ5).

Gβ5 also participates in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) by forming complexes with R7 family proteins, which interact with various GPCRs and influence insulin secretion pathways (Wang2020The). The S81L mutation in GNB5 affects the stability of Gβ5 and its ability to interact with RGS9-2, impacting dopamine receptor signaling (Shamseldin2016GNB5).
