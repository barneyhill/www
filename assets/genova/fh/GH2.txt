# GH2

## Overview
The GH2 gene encodes the protein known as placental growth hormone (PGH), a member of the somatotropin/prolactin family of hormones, which are critical regulators of growth and metabolism. Unlike the pituitary growth hormone, PGH is primarily expressed in the placenta and plays a pivotal role in modulating maternal and fetal physiology during pregnancy. It acts as an insulin antagonist and is involved in the regulation of maternal insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) production, thereby influencing glucose utilization and nutrient delivery to the fetus (Männik2012Differential; Timasheva2013Developmental). The GH2 gene's expression and its alternative splicing are linked to fetal growth outcomes, with variations in expression associated with conditions such as small-for-gestational-age (SGA) and large-for-gestational-age (LGA) pregnancies (Männik2010Differential). Additionally, alterations in GH2 have been implicated in growth disorders and pregnancy complications, highlighting its clinical significance in both prenatal and postnatal growth regulation (Männik2012Differential; Prager2003Characterization).

## Function
The GH2 gene encodes placental growth hormone (PGH), which plays a significant role in fetal development and maternal metabolism. PGH is primarily expressed in the placenta and is secreted into the maternal bloodstream, where it binds to somatotrophic and lactogenic receptors on various tissues, influencing biological actions across many tissues (Männik2012Differential). This hormone progressively replaces maternal pituitary growth hormone from mid-gestation onwards, peaking towards term, and is predominantly found in maternal circulation (Timasheva2013Developmental).

PGH functions as an insulin antagonist, controlling maternal Insulin Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1) production and glucose utilization during pregnancy, which is crucial for ensuring nutrient delivery to the developing fetus (Timasheva2013Developmental). The concentration of PGH in maternal serum is positively correlated with birth weight, indicating its role in fetal growth regulation (Timasheva2013Developmental). The expression of GH2 and its alternative splicing products is associated with the birth weight of newborns, with altered expression observed in small-for-gestational-age (SGA) and large-for-gestational-age (LGA) pregnancies compared to appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) pregnancies (Männik2010Differential). These findings suggest that GH2 is integral to fetal growth and development, as well as maternal metabolic adaptation during pregnancy.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GH2 gene, which encodes placental growth hormone, have been associated with various growth-related conditions. In the context of Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS), a condition characterized by severe growth retardation, deletions involving the GH2 gene have been identified in some patients. These deletions were found to be paternally inherited in certain cases, suggesting a potential role for GH2 in the etiology of SRS (Prager2003Characterization).

Altered expression of GH2 has also been linked to pregnancy complications. In pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia (PE), there is a trend of reduced expression of the GH2 gene, which may contribute to fetal growth restriction observed in these cases (Männik2012Differential). Conversely, in gestational diabetes mellitus (GD) cases resulting in large-for-gestational-age newborns, increased expression of GH2 transcripts has been noted, suggesting a role in promoting fetal growth (Männik2012Differential).

Additionally, a genetic variant in the GH2 gene, rs2006123, has been associated with adult height determination, particularly in men, indicating that GH2 may influence growth potential beyond fetal development (Timasheva2013Developmental). These findings underscore the clinical significance of GH2 in growth regulation and its potential impact on metabolic processes.
