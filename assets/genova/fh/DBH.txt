# DBH

## Overview
The DBH gene encodes the enzyme dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DbH), a copper-containing monooxygenase that plays a critical role in catecholamine biosynthesis by catalyzing the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine. This enzyme is predominantly found in noradrenergic and adrenergic neurons, where it is essential for maintaining sympathetic nervous system function (Cubells2016Human). Structurally, DbH is characterized by its complex quaternary structure, functioning as a homodimer or homotetramer, and is stabilized by disulfide bonds and non-covalent interactions (Vendelboe2016The). The enzyme's activity is crucial for normal physiological processes, and its deficiency can lead to significant clinical manifestations, including orthostatic hypotension and other symptoms of sympathetic failure (Cubells2016Human). Additionally, interactions between DbH and proteins such as α-synuclein have been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its broader significance in human health (Lehrer2022αsynuclein).

## Structure
The human dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) protein is a copper-containing enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine. It is composed of 617 amino acids and contains 15 cysteine residues, 14 of which form disulfide bonds crucial for maintaining its structure (Kapoor2011Structural). The primary structure of DBH includes domains such as the DOMON domain, the Copper type II ascorbate-dependent monooxygenase N-terminal domain, and the C-terminal domain (Kapoor2011Structural).

The secondary structure of DBH is characterized by a high content of loops (61%), beta-sheets (30%), and alpha-helices (9%), indicating a flexible structure (Kapoor2011Structural). The tertiary structure involves a beta-sandwich fold in the DOMON domain, which is involved in ligand binding and possibly tetramerization (Kapoor2011Structural; Vendelboe2016The).

DBH functions as a homodimer or homotetramer, with the dimerization domain consisting of two antiparallel alpha-helices forming a four-helix bundle (Vendelboe2016The). The quaternary structure is stabilized by disulfide bonds and non-covalent interactions, with the DOMON domain contributing significantly to tetramerization (Kapoor2011Structural).

Post-translational modifications include glycosylation at four predicted sites, which may affect enzyme activity and stability (Vendelboe2016The). The enzyme requires two type 2 copper ions per subunit for its catalytic activity (Vendelboe2016The).

## Function
The DBH gene encodes the enzyme dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DbH), which is crucial for the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine (NE) in noradrenergic and adrenergic cells. This conversion is essential for maintaining sympathetic noradrenergic tone, which is vital for normal physiological functions (Cubells2016Human). DbH is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and packaged into vesicles where it catalyzes the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine. The NE is then released into the synaptic cleft to interact with various receptors, and it is eventually taken back into the presynaptic cell or degraded (Gonzalez‐Lopez2019Dopamine).

DbH is localized in the locus coeruleus and other noradrenergic cells, and it is released into the synaptic cleft during neurotransmission, allowing NE and DbH to be detected in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (Gonzalez‐Lopez2019Dopamine). The enzyme's activity is consistent across different tissues, making serum DbH a reliable marker for neuronal DbH activity (Gonzalez‐Lopez2019Dopamine). The absence of DBH leads to a syndrome characterized by inadequate sympathetic tone, resulting in severe orthostatic hypotension and other manifestations of sympathetic failure (Cubells2016Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DBH gene, which encodes the enzyme dopamine beta-hydroxylase, are associated with several diseases and conditions. DBH deficiency is a rare disorder characterized by severe orthostatic hypotension, due to the absence of norepinephrine and epinephrine in plasma, and elevated dopamine levels. This condition is linked to specific mutations in the DBH gene, such as the IVS1+2T→C splice site mutation, which disrupts normal mRNA splicing (Cubells2004Human; Senard2006Dopamine). 

DBH genetic variants are also implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders. For instance, the rs6271 Arg549Cys polymorphism is associated with Type 2 diabetes and obesity, particularly in Russian populations, and is linked to noradrenergic signaling (Gonzalez‐Lopez2019Dopamine). Variants like rs1611115 and rs129882 affect gene expression and are associated with conditions such as major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia (Gonzalez‐Lopez2019Dopamine). 

In neurodegenerative diseases, DBH variants have been studied in relation to Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. The rs1611115 SNP is implicated in Alzheimer's disease, interacting with pro-inflammatory cytokine genes to increase disease risk (Gonzalez‐Lopez2019Dopamine). Despite these associations, some studies have found inconsistent results regarding the link between DBH polymorphisms and these diseases (Tang2018Association).

## Interactions
Dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) is known to interact with α-synuclein, a protein implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. The study by Lehrer and Rheinstein demonstrated that α-synuclein partially enfolds DBH, potentially reducing the synthesis of norepinephrine by inhibiting DBH's enzymatic activity. This interaction is characterized by a balance of electrostatic, hydrophobic, and van der Waals forces, suggesting a significant physical interaction between these proteins (Lehrer2022αsynuclein).

The interaction between α-synuclein and DBH may have implications for the regulation of neurotransmitter synthesis, particularly in the context of neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease. By potentially inhibiting DBH, α-synuclein could contribute to decreased levels of norepinephrine, which is a critical neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. This interaction highlights the potential for therapeutic strategies that target the α-synuclein-DBH interaction to restore norepinephrine levels and ameliorate symptoms associated with such diseases (Lehrer2022αsynuclein).
