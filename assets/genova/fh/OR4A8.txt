# OR4A8

## Overview
The OR4A8 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily A member 8, which is part of the olfactory receptor family. This family of proteins is primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules and is categorized as a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). These receptors are characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is typical of many receptors involved in signal transduction across cell membranes. The OR4A8 gene is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it plays a crucial role in the sense of smell by binding specific odorant molecules and initiating a neuronal response that is ultimately perceived as smell. The gene's expression and function are essential for the proper functioning of the olfactory system, although variations in this gene may have implications for olfactory sensitivity and perception (Qiu2020aarFDC).
