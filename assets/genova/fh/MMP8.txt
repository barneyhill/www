# MMP8

## Overview
Matrix metallopeptidase 8 (MMP8), also known as neutrophil collagenase or collagenase-2, is a gene that encodes a member of the matrix metalloproteinase family, which are zinc-dependent endopeptidases. The MMP8 gene is primarily expressed in polymorphonuclear neutrophils and is involved in the degradation of extracellular matrix components, particularly collagen types I, II, and III, playing a crucial role in tissue remodeling and repair (Atanasova2023Matrix). The protein product of MMP8 is synthesized as an inactive zymogen and requires proteolytic activation to become functional. MMP8 is implicated in various physiological processes, including immune response modulation and dentin maturation, and has significant clinical relevance in conditions such as cancer, inflammatory disorders, and cardiovascular diseases (Sulkala2007Matrix; Dejonckheere2011Matrix). Its activity is tightly regulated by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) and other molecular interactions, ensuring precise control over its proteolytic functions (Farr1999The).

## Structure
Matrix metallopeptidase 8 (MMP8), also known as neutrophil collagenase, is a member of the matrix metalloproteinase family. The primary structure of MMP8 includes a signal peptide, a propeptide, a catalytic domain with a zinc-binding motif, and a hemopexin-like C-terminal domain (Borkakoti2000Structural). The catalytic domain is characterized by a five-stranded β-sheet and three helices, with a deep cleft around the catalytic zinc, which is crucial for the enzyme's activity (Borkakoti2000Structural). 

The secondary structure of MMP8 consists of alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its compact, globular tertiary structure stabilized by disulfide bonds (Massova1998Matrix). The enzyme can form homodimers, representing its quaternary structure (Massova1998Matrix). 

MMP8 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and activation by proteolytic cleavage (Massova1998Matrix). The enzyme's structure is further defined by the presence of a hemopexin-like domain, which plays a significant role in substrate recognition and specificity (Massova1998Matrix). The catalytic domain's zinc-binding motif is essential for its enzymatic function, with zinc and calcium atoms stabilizing the structure (Borkakoti2000Structural).

## Function
Matrix metallopeptidase 8 (MMP8), also known as collagenase-2, is a crucial enzyme involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, particularly collagen types I, II, and III. It is synthesized as an inactive zymogen (proMMP-8) and becomes active through proteolytic cleavage. MMP8 is primarily released by polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), but it is also expressed by other cell types, including macrophages, T-cells, and various epithelial cells (Atanasova2023Matrix).

In healthy human cells, MMP8 plays a significant role in tissue remodeling and repair processes. It facilitates the migration of neutrophil granulocytes from circulation into tissues by cleaving collagen and other ECM components, which is essential for normal immune responses and tissue remodeling (Atanasova2023Matrix). MMP8 is also involved in the organization of the dentin organic matrix before mineralization, contributing to dentin maturation and formation (Sulkala2007Matrix).

The enzyme's activity is regulated by the rate of degranulation in PMNs and is further modulated by membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP), which activates pro-MMP-8 (Holopainen2003Activation). This regulation ensures that MMP8's collagenolytic activity is precisely controlled, preventing excessive tissue destruction while allowing for effective tissue repair and remodeling.

## Clinical Significance
Matrix metallopeptidase 8 (MMP8) has significant clinical implications in various diseases due to its altered expression levels and genetic variations. In cancer, MMP8 exhibits both tumor-suppressive and tumor-promoting roles. In tongue squamous cell carcinoma, MMP8 expression is associated with improved survival, suggesting a protective role (Korpi2008Collagenase2). In breast cancer, MMP8 is linked to reduced lymph node metastasis and improved prognosis, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Decock2008Plasma). Conversely, high MMP8 levels correlate with poor prognosis in liver and gastric cancers (Juurikka2019The).

Genetic polymorphisms in MMP8 also influence cancer risk. The +17 C/G polymorphism is associated with a decreased risk of lung cancer (GonzálezArriaga2008Polymorphism). In breast cancer, the SNP rs11225395 is linked to lower risk and higher survival, while SNP rs2155052 is associated with decreased lung cancer risk, particularly in smokers (Juurikka2019The).

Beyond cancer, MMP8 plays a role in inflammatory disorders. In periodontal disease, its expression correlates with disease severity, while in cardiovascular disease, MMP8 activity is linked to plaque progression (Dejonckheere2011Matrix). These findings underscore the diverse clinical significance of MMP8 in disease progression and prognosis.

## Interactions
Matrix metallopeptidase 8 (MMP8) is known to interact with various proteins, influencing its activity and function. MMP8 interacts with tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), specifically TIMP-2, which regulates its proteolytic activity. The binding interactions between MMP8 and TIMP-2 have been analyzed using biomolecular interaction analysis, revealing that TIMP-2 is a more effective inhibitor of the activated form of MMP8 compared to its superactivated variant (Farr1999The).

MMP8 also interacts with the anti-adhesive glycoprotein FXYD5 in tongue carcinoma cells. MMP8 cleaves FXYD5 from the cell membrane, which increases cell-cell adhesion and reduces migration, representing a tumor-protective mechanism in this context (Juurikka2021MMP8). This interaction highlights MMP8's role in modulating cell adhesion dynamics through its proteolytic activity (Juurikka2021MMP8).

In addition, MMP8 is involved in the degradation of type-I collagen fibrils. The enzyme binds to the true cleavage site on collagen fibrils, facilitating the breakdown of these structures. This interaction is crucial for the degradation process and is influenced by the presence of non-catalytic domains that help localize the catalytic domain near the cleavage site (Lu2013Insight).
