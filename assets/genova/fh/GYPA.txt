# GYPA

## Overview
The GYPA gene encodes glycophorin A, a transmembrane sialoglycoprotein that plays a critical role in the structural integrity and function of erythrocyte membranes. Glycophorin A is a key component of the MNS blood group system and is characterized by its heavily glycosylated extracellular domain, which contributes to its antigenic properties. As a receptor, glycophorin A is involved in cell-cell interactions and serves as a binding site for various pathogens, including the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, influencing the evolutionary dynamics of the gene (Hollox2022Genetic; Bigham2018Complex). Despite its interactions with pathogens, individuals lacking glycophorin A generally remain healthy, suggesting its non-essential role in human health (Hollox2022Genetic). The protein's interactions with other membrane proteins, such as the anion exchanger 1, underscore its importance in maintaining erythrocyte membrane stability and function (Hsu2022A).

## Structure
Glycophorin A (GYPA) is a single-pass transmembrane sialoglycoprotein found in the membrane of human erythrocytes. The primary structure of GYPA consists of a polypeptide chain with a heavily glycosylated extracellular domain, which contributes to its antigenic properties and function in the MNS blood group system (Lopez2021Glycophorins). The protein is encoded by the GYPA gene, which includes several exons. Exon 1 up to the 5' end of Exon 2 encodes a 19-amino acid leader sequence that is cleaved after membrane insertion, resulting in a mature protein with 131 amino acid residues (Lopez2021Glycophorins).

The secondary structure of GYPA includes alpha-helical regions, which are typical of transmembrane proteins. The transmembrane region is encoded by Exon 5, while the intracellular domain is encoded by Exons 6-7 (Lopez2021Glycophorins). GYPA forms a dimer, representing its quaternary structure, which is crucial for its function as a receptor and in maintaining the structural integrity of the erythrocyte membrane.

Post-translational modifications of GYPA include extensive O-linked glycosylation, which contributes to the strong net negative charge on the surface of red blood cells, preventing aggregation and maintaining blood flow (Lopez2021Glycophorins).

## Function
Glycophorin A (GYPA) is a sialoglycoprotein prominently expressed on the surface of human erythrocytes. It plays a significant role in maintaining the stability and integrity of the red blood cell membrane. The protein is heavily glycosylated, contributing to a negatively charged glycan coat on erythrocytes, which aids in their circulation by preventing adhesion to other cells and blood vessel walls (Ko2011Effects; Hollox2022Genetic).

GYPA is involved in cell-cell interactions and serves as a receptor for various pathogens. It is notably the primary binding site for the 175-kD erythrocyte-binding antigen (EBA-175) of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, facilitating the parasite's invasion of red blood cells (Hollox2022Genetic; Bigham2018Complex). This interaction is crucial in the context of malaria, as it influences the evolutionary pressures on the gene (Ko2011Effects).

In addition to its role in malaria, GYPA may act as a decoy receptor for other pathogens, such as influenza viruses, diverting them away from target tissues (Louzada2020Structural; Hollox2022Genetic). Despite its interactions with pathogens, individuals lacking glycophorin A are generally healthy, indicating that its absence does not critically affect health (Hollox2022Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and structural variations in the GYPA gene, which encodes glycophorin A, have significant clinical implications, particularly in relation to malaria susceptibility and blood group antigenicity. The GYPA gene is involved in the MNS blood group system and serves as a receptor for Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite responsible for malaria. Variants such as the DUP4 structural variant, which involves a GYPB-GYPA fusion, have been associated with resistance to severe malaria by increasing red blood cell surface tension, thereby preventing parasite invasion (Louzada2020Structural; Hollox2022Genetic).

Alterations in GYPA can also lead to the expression of low-prevalence antigens in the MNS blood group system, which are associated with conditions like hemolytic transfusion reactions and hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (Hassan2019Molecular). The presence of rare antibodies, such as anti-En a, can cause complications in transfusion and pregnancy, particularly in individuals with null phenotypes for antigens on both glycophorin A and B (Howard2019Clinical).

The evolutionary pressure exerted by malaria has led to significant genetic variation in the GYPA gene, with evidence of natural selection in malaria-endemic regions, further complicating the genetic landscape of this gene (Ko2011Effects; Hollox2022Genetic).

## Interactions
Glycophorin A (GYPA) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a crucial role in the structural and functional integrity of erythrocyte membranes. One of its primary interactions is with the anion exchanger 1 (AE1), also known as band 3. This interaction is essential for the surface expression and anion transport activity of AE1. GYPA facilitates the forward trafficking of AE1 to the plasma membrane, enhancing its function as a Cl^-/HCO3^- transporter, which is vital for CO2 transport and pH stabilization in cells (Hsu2022A). 

GYPA also interacts with band 3 in Xenopus oocytes, where it enhances band 3-mediated chloride transport. This interaction is specific to GYPA and does not occur with other glycophorins like Glycophorin B (GPB) or Glycophorin C (GPC) (Groves1992Glycophorin). The interaction between GYPA and band 3 is thought to occur during biosynthesis, potentially inducing band 3 oligomerization necessary for its transport to the plasma membrane (Groves1992Glycophorin). 

Additionally, GYPA is involved in the band 3 macrocomplex within the red blood cell membrane, linking it to other proteins such as the Rh complex, CD47, and protein 4.2 (Bruce2003A). These interactions highlight GYPA's role in maintaining erythrocyte membrane stability and function.
