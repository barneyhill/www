# DDX10

## Overview
DDX10 is a gene that encodes the protein DEAD-box helicase 10, a member of the DEAD-box protein family, which is characterized by its ATP-dependent RNA helicase activity. This protein plays a pivotal role in RNA metabolism, particularly in the processing and assembly of ribosomal RNA within the nucleolus, contributing to ribosome biogenesis and cellular protein synthesis (Popova2021DEADbox). DEAD-box helicase 10 is involved in unwinding RNA structures, facilitating the maturation of ribosomal RNA, and ensuring the proper assembly of ribosomal subunits, which are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Popova2021DEADbox). The gene's involvement in various cellular processes and its interactions with other proteins underscore its significance in both normal physiology and disease states, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Abdelhaleem2003The; Zhou2022DDX10).

## Function
DDX10 (DEAD-box helicase 10) is a member of the DEAD-box protein family, characterized by its role in RNA metabolism. In healthy human cells, DDX10 is primarily active in the nucleolus, where it plays a crucial role in ribosomal RNA processing and ribosome assembly. It is involved in the assembly of the small subunit (SSU) processome, which is essential for 18S rRNA biogenesis, a critical step in ribosome biogenesis (Popova2021DEADbox). This process is vital for protein synthesis and cellular growth, as ribosomes are responsible for translating mRNA into proteins.

DDX10's activity in the nucleolus involves unwinding RNA structures to facilitate the processing and maturation of ribosomal RNA, which is necessary for the proper assembly of ribosomal subunits (Popova2021DEADbox). The helicase function of DDX10 is crucial for maintaining the integrity of nucleolar processes, which are essential for cellular homeostasis and function (Popova2021DEADbox). Although its specific function in healthy cells is not fully determined, DDX10's involvement in these fundamental cellular processes underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular physiology (Abdelhaleem2003The).

## Clinical Significance
The DDX10 gene is implicated in several diseases due to mutations, altered expression levels, or changes in its interactions. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), DDX10 forms fusion proteins with NUP98, such as NUP98-DDX10, leading to transcriptional deregulation and transformation of leukemic cells (Cai2017Wanted). In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), the DDX10-NUP90 fusion is associated with the Philadelphia chromosome, contributing to the disease's development (Cai2017Wanted).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), DDX10 is overexpressed in advanced stages, promoting cell proliferation and metastasis. Knockdown of DDX10 in CRC cell lines reduces growth and invasiveness while increasing apoptosis. This suggests its role in CRC progression through RNA splicing and interaction with proteins like RPL35 (Zhou2022DDX10).

DDX10 is also involved in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's Disease (PD), where it enhances α-synuclein toxicity and oligomerization, contributing to nucleolar disruption and oxidative stress (Popova2021DEADbox). In breast cancer, genomic rearrangements involving DDX10 are linked to increased apoptosis, indicating its role in cancer development (Cai2017Wanted). Elevated DDX10 expression is associated with poor survival in chondrosarcoma patients, highlighting its dual role as an oncogene and tumor suppressor (Arna2023Synthetic).

## Interactions
DDX10, a DEAD-box RNA helicase, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. It interacts with α-synuclein (αSyn), a protein associated with neurodegenerative diseases, enhancing αSyn toxicity and oligomerization. This interaction leads to the formation of cytoplasmic inclusions and nucleolar disruption, contributing to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction observed in Parkinson's disease (Popova2021DEADbox). DDX10 directly binds to αSyn, stabilizing oligomeric species and inhibiting fibrilization, which increases αSyn-induced cytotoxicity (Popova2021DEADbox).

In the context of colorectal cancer (CRC), DDX10 interacts with RPL35, a ribosomal protein, influencing the E2F pathway crucial for CRC progression. This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays and is implicated in the alternative splicing of RPL35 mRNA, affecting CRC cell proliferation and metastasis (Zhou2022DDX10). DDX10 is also part of a protein-protein interaction network involving 110 proteins related to microtubule binding, the cell cycle, and RNA splicing, as identified through STRING database analysis (Zhou2022DDX10).

These interactions highlight DDX10's multifaceted role in both neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.
