# SLC25A21

## Overview
The SLC25A21 gene encodes a protein known as solute carrier family 25 member 21, which functions as a mitochondrial oxodicarboxylate carrier (ODC). This transmembrane protein is integral to the mitochondrial inner membrane, where it facilitates the transport of specific metabolites, such as 2-oxoadipate and 2-oxoglutarate, between the mitochondrial matrix and the cytosol. These transport processes are essential for the catabolism of amino acids like lysine and tryptophan, ultimately contributing to energy production through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The SLC25A21 gene is ubiquitously expressed across various human tissues, underscoring its critical role in cellular metabolism and homeostasis. Alterations in the expression or function of this gene have been implicated in several diseases, including mitochondrial myopathy and certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Palmieri2020Diseases; Wang2022Low; Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological).

## Function
The SLC25A21 gene encodes the mitochondrial oxodicarboxylate carrier (ODC), which is crucial for the transport of specific metabolites across the mitochondrial inner membrane. This protein facilitates the exchange of 2-oxoadipate and 2-oxoglutarate between the mitochondrial matrix and the cytosol, a process essential for the catabolism of lysine and tryptophan. Once inside the mitochondria, 2-oxoadipate is converted into acetyl-CoA, which then enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, playing a significant role in energy production (Palmieri2020Diseases; Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological).

The ODC also transports other metabolites such as glutarate and aminoadipate, albeit with lower efficiency, and is involved in a counter-exchange mechanism sensitive to pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) and bathophenanthroline (Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological). The protein's activity is vital for maintaining normal mitochondrial function and energy metabolism, as it ensures the proper flow of metabolites necessary for the TCA cycle and other metabolic pathways (Palmieri2020Diseases).

In healthy human cells, SLC25A21 is ubiquitously expressed with minimal variation across tissues, indicating its fundamental role in cellular metabolism and homeostasis (Wang2022Low).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the SLC25A21 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. A homozygous missense mutation in SLC25A21, resulting in the p.Lys232Arg replacement, is associated with a spinal muscular atrophy-like disease and mitochondrial myopathy. This mutation disrupts the oxodicarboxylate carrier (ODC) function, leading to the accumulation of toxic intermediates such as pipecolic and quinolinic acid, which contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction and spinal motor neuron abnormalities (Palmieri2020Diseases; Parikh2019Mitochondrial).

In cancer research, SLC25A21 has been identified as a tumor suppressor gene in bladder cancer (BCa). Its expression is significantly downregulated in BCa tissues, correlating with poor prognosis. Overexpression of SLC25A21 inhibits cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and induces apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Wang2021SLC25A21).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), low expression of SLC25A21 is associated with poor prognosis and increased cell proliferation. It is linked to pathways such as PI3K-Akt and Wnt signaling, and its expression correlates with immune cell infiltration, indicating a role in immune response and potential as a prognostic marker (Wang2022Low).
