# CENPVL3

## Overview
CENPVL3 is a gene that encodes the protein centromere protein V like 3, which is involved in cellular processes related to the centromere, a key component of chromosome segregation during cell division. The protein is categorized as a centromeric protein, playing a crucial role in the assembly and function of the kinetochore, a structure essential for proper chromosome alignment and segregation. Although specific details about the structure and function of CENPVL3 are still under investigation, its involvement in centromere dynamics suggests it may be critical for maintaining genomic stability. Further research is needed to elucidate its precise molecular mechanisms and potential implications in human health and disease.
