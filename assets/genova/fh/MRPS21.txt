# MRPS21

## Overview
The MRPS21 gene encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S21, which is a vital component of the small 28S subunit of the mammalian mitochondrial ribosome, also known as the mitoribosome. This protein plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA, which is essential for the production of proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation. Structurally, MRPS21 is characterized by an α-helical C-terminal region and an N-terminal extension that interacts with other mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, contributing to the unique architecture and function of the mitoribosome (Kaushal2014CryoEM). The gene's expression and the protein's function are critical for early development, as evidenced by knockout studies in mice that result in preweaning lethality (Cheong2020Expression). MRPS21's involvement in mitochondrial function also implicates it in various clinical conditions, including its downregulation in trisomy 21, which affects mitoribosome stability and mitochondrial protein synthesis (Yim2019mitoXplorer).

## Structure
The MRPS21 protein is a component of the small 28S subunit of the mammalian mitochondrial ribosome, playing a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis. Structurally, MRPS21 is involved in the initiation of protein synthesis and is modeled into the cryo-EM density, supporting an α-helical structure for its C terminus. This region interacts with MRP S2 and a density tentatively assigned to MRP S36 on the solvent side (Kaushal2014CryoEM). The N-terminal extension (NTE) of MRPS21 makes significant contacts with both conserved and mito-specific extensions of MRPs S11 and S18A in the cleft region of the platform, indicating its involvement in the unique structural organization of the mitochondrial ribosome (Kaushal2014CryoEM).

Despite its importance, no cross-links were observed between mammalian mitochondrial translational initiation factor 3 (IF3 mt) and MRPS21, possibly due to the low molecular weight and high lysine and arginine content of MRPS21, which complicates detection by mass spectrometry (Haque2011Contacts). This suggests that MRPS21 may have unique structural features that differentiate it from other ribosomal proteins in terms of interaction patterns. The specific post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms of MRPS21 remain less characterized in the available literature.

## Function
MRPS21 encodes a mitochondrial ribosomal protein that is a component of the small 28S subunit of the mammalian mitochondrial ribosome (mitoribosome). This protein plays a critical role in the initiation of mitochondrial protein synthesis by facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA, which is essential for the production of proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation (Kaushal2014CryoEM). The C-terminal region of MRPS21 is modeled into the cryo-EM density, supporting an α-helical structure, and interacts with other mitochondrial ribosomal proteins such as MRP S2 and MRP S36, contributing to the unique structural organization of the mitoribosome (Kaushal2014CryoEM).

MRPS21 is involved in the remodeling of the mRNA entrance and exit regions of the mitoribosome, which is significantly different from bacterial ribosomes. This remodeling is crucial for the recruitment and translation of mitochondrial mRNAs, which often lack 5′ untranslated regions (UTRs) (Kaushal2014CryoEM). The protein's N-terminal extension makes significant contacts with conserved and mito-specific extensions of other MRPs, indicating its role in the structural and functional adaptations of the mitoribosome to meet specific mitochondrial needs (Kaushal2014CryoEM). MRPS21 is essential for early development, as knockout studies have shown that its absence results in preweaning lethality (Cheong2020Expression).

## Clinical Significance
MRPS21 is implicated in various clinical conditions due to its role in mitochondrial function. In the context of trisomy 21, MRPS21 is significantly downregulated at both the transcript and protein levels in RPE T21 cells. This downregulation is associated with the disintegration of the mitoribosome and a subsequent decrease in mitochondrial proteins involved in the respiratory chain, particularly oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) components. The downregulation of MRPS21 is not attributed to changes in mitochondrial transcript levels, suggesting a post-transcriptional regulation issue. This indicates that MRPS21 is crucial for mitoribosome stability, and its absence could lead to ribosome malfunction, contributing to the variability in OXPHOS defects observed in trisomy 21 (Yim2019mitoXplorer).

In mouse models, MRPS21 is essential for early development, as null mutations result in embryonic lethality, with developmental arrest occurring at pre-gastrulation stages. This suggests that disruptions in MRPS21 can lead to early developmental arrest, highlighting its critical role in mitochondrial function during development (Cheong2020Expression). While specific mutations in MRPS21 have not been directly linked to human diseases, its role in mitochondrial function suggests potential implications in mitochondrial disorders.

## Interactions
MRPS21 is a component of the mitochondrial ribosomal small subunit (28S) and is involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis. It interacts with other mitochondrial ribosomal proteins to form the ribosomal complex. Specifically, MRPS21 has been identified as one of the proteins that co-migrates with other mitoribosomal proteins within the 28S mitoribosomal complex, suggesting potential interactions with these proteins (Wessels2013Analysis). 

In studies involving the human gene C4orf14, MRPS21 was identified as one of the proteins interacting with C4orf14, with significant isotope ratios indicating a strong association. This interaction suggests that MRPS21 may play a role in the biogenesis of the small mitochondrial ribosomal subunit and is involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis or mtRNA metabolism (He2012Human).

Despite its role as a platform protein in the small subunit of bacterial ribosomes, MRPS21 did not show cross-linking with mammalian mitochondrial translational initiation factor 3 (IF3 mt) in cross-linking studies. This lack of cross-linking could be due to the low molecular weight and high Lys and Arg content of MRPS21, which makes detection by mass spectrometry challenging (Haque2011Contacts).
