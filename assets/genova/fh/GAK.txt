# GAK

## Overview
Cyclin G-associated kinase (GAK) is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase protein involved in various cellular processes, most notably clathrin-mediated membrane trafficking. The GAK protein, also known as cyclin G-associated kinase, plays a pivotal role in the uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles during endocytosis, acting as a cofactor for the heat shock cognate protein Hsc70. This kinase is characterized by its conserved domains, including a Ser/Thr kinase domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity. Beyond its role in membrane trafficking, GAK is implicated in maintaining centrosome integrity and ensuring proper chromosome congression during mitosis. It also interacts with several proteins, including clathrin, adaptor protein complexes, and the androgen receptor, highlighting its involvement in diverse cellular functions. Clinically, mutations in the GAK gene have been associated with Parkinson's disease, underscoring its significance in neurodegenerative disorders (Lee2005Depletion; Zhang2015The; Dumitriu2011CyclinGassociated).

## Structure
The human GAK (cyclin G-associated kinase) protein consists of 1311 amino acids and includes several conserved domains and motifs crucial for its function. It features a Ser/Thr kinase domain, a tensin-like domain, an auxilin-like domain, and a Tyr phosphorylation site (KGDLDISY) (Kimura1997Structure). The kinase domain of GAK exhibits a typical bi-lobal architecture, with a larger C-lobe and a smaller N-lobe, which is common among kinases (Ohbayashi2018Structural). The N-terminal region of GAK forms an additional β-strand that extends the N-lobe β-sheet, contributing to its structural stability (Chaikuad2014Structure).

GAK's activation segment is highly flexible, allowing it to adopt different conformations, which are stabilized by nanobodies in structural studies (Chaikuad2014Structure). The protein is constitutively active and does not require phosphorylation of its activation segment for activity (Chaikuad2014Structure). GAK can form dimers, although this is not considered physiologically relevant under cellular conditions (Chaikuad2014Structure). The protein's structure is conserved across species, with key motifs and phosphorylation sites retained between human and rat GAK (Kimura1997Structure).

## Function
Cyclin G-associated kinase (GAK) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in clathrin-mediated membrane trafficking, particularly in the uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) during endocytosis. GAK acts as a cofactor for Hsc70, facilitating the uncoating process necessary for receptor-mediated endocytosis and the recycling of clathrin (Zhang2005Multiple; Lee2005Depletion). It is involved in the phosphorylation of clathrin adaptor proteins, such as AP-1 and AP-2, which are essential for the assembly and function of clathrin-coated vesicles (Zhang2005Multiple).

GAK is also implicated in maintaining centrosome integrity and proper chromosome congression during mitosis. Its depletion leads to mitotic arrest and activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint, indicating its role in ensuring proper chromosome alignment and mitotic progression (Shimizu2009GAK). GAK localizes in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, suggesting additional nuclear functions, potentially involving interactions with nuclear proteins like p53 and clathrin heavy chain (Sato2009GAK). These activities highlight GAK's essential role in cellular processes beyond membrane trafficking, including cell cycle regulation and mitotic progression.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GAK gene are significantly associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). A polymorphism in the GAK gene, rs1564282, has been linked to an increased risk of PD, with studies showing a genome-wide significant association and a meta-analysis odds ratio of 1.48 (Rhodes2010Replication; Dumitriu2011CyclinGassociated). This polymorphism is associated with higher expression levels of α-synuclein, a protein implicated in PD pathogenesis, and GAK knockdown has been shown to increase α-synuclein toxicity in cell models (Dumitriu2011CyclinGassociated).

In the Han Chinese population, specific GAK variants, such as c.3824T>G, c.3819G>A, and c.3794T>C, are associated with a decreased risk of sporadic Parkinson's disease (sPD) (Zhang2015The). These variants may influence α-synuclein metabolism by affecting the interaction with HSP70, a molecular chaperone involved in protein homeostasis (Zhang2015The).

GAK is also involved in the autophagy-lysosome system, and its disruption can impair autophagic flux, potentially contributing to neurodegenerative conditions like PD (Miyazaki2021Targeted). The gene's role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and its interaction with proteins like CTSD further implicate it in PD pathogenesis (Dumitriu2011CyclinGassociated).

## Interactions
Cyclin G-associated kinase (GAK) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. GAK interacts with clathrin and Hsc70, playing a significant role in the uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles. This interaction is facilitated by GAK's J-domain, which is essential for the uncoating process, as demonstrated by the inability of a J-domain-deleted variant to support uncoating (Greener2000Role).

GAK also interacts with the medium chain subunits of the AP-1 and AP-2 adaptor complexes, phosphorylating them in vitro. This phosphorylation is crucial for the function of clathrin-coated vesicles (Korolchuk2002CK2). Additionally, GAK binds to the γ1-ear domain of adaptor protein 1 (AP1) through specific sequences, which is important for lysosomal enzyme sorting (Kametaka2007Canonical).

In the context of prostate cancer, GAK interacts with the androgen receptor (AR), acting as a transcriptional coactivator. This interaction is enhanced by hormones and is significant in the progression of hormone-refractory prostate cancer (Ray2005Cyclin).

GAK also phosphorylates the B'γ subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), regulating its activity and influencing dephosphorylation events during mitosis and in response to DNA damage (Naito2012Cyclin).
