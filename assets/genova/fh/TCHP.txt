# TCHP

## Overview
The TCHP gene encodes the protein trichoplein keratin filament-binding, which is integral to the structural organization and functional regulation of the cytoskeleton in human cells. Trichoplein is categorized as a keratin filament-binding protein, and it plays a pivotal role in anchoring microtubules at the centrosome, thereby facilitating proper cell division and maintaining cellular architecture (Ibi2011Trichoplein). Additionally, trichoplein is involved in the regulation of primary cilium assembly by interacting with Aurora A kinase, which is crucial for cell cycle progression (NISHIMURA2019Intermediate; Nishimura2021Aurora). The protein's functions extend to maintaining chromosomal stability and integrity, with implications in cancer biology due to its role in genomic stability and telomere maintenance (Lauriola2022Telomere). Through its interactions with various proteins, trichoplein is essential for cellular processes that underpin both normal physiology and pathological conditions.

## Function
Trichoplein, encoded by the TCHP gene, is a keratin filament-binding protein that plays a significant role in the organization and stability of the cytoskeleton in healthy human cells. It is involved in anchoring microtubules at the centrosome by binding to centrosomal proteins Odf2 and ninein, which are essential for microtubule organization and cell division (Ibi2011Trichoplein). Trichoplein's interaction with these proteins is crucial for the recruitment of ninein to the subdistal appendages of the mother centriole, facilitating proper microtubule anchoring (Ibi2011Trichoplein).

In addition to its role in microtubule organization, trichoplein is involved in the regulation of primary cilium assembly. It acts as a suppressor of cilium formation by activating Aurora A kinase at the centrosome, which is necessary for cell cycle progression and proliferation (NISHIMURA2019Intermediate; Nishimura2021Aurora). Trichoplein is also implicated in maintaining chromosomal stability and integrity, as its depletion can lead to chromosomal instability and telomere dysfunction, particularly in cancer cells (Lauriola2022Telomere). These functions highlight trichoplein's critical role in cellular architecture and its potential implications in cancer biology.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the TCHP gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions. TCHP plays a critical role in regulating primary cilia formation and cell proliferation. Its interaction with AURKA is essential for suppressing ciliogenesis, and disruptions in this pathway can lead to disorders such as polycystic kidney disease and situs inversus (Nishimura2021Aurora). The stability of TCHP is influenced by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and its dysregulation can affect cell proliferation, potentially contributing to cancer development (Nishimura2021Aurora).

TCHP also regulates AKT signaling through lipid raft dynamics around primary cilia. Alterations in TCHP expression can lead to changes in lipid metabolism, affecting adipogenesis and potentially offering a target for anti-obesity therapies. In TCHP knockout mice, resistance to the negative metabolic effects of a high-fat diet has been observed, suggesting a protective role against obesity (Nishimura2021Aurora). Furthermore, hyperactivation of lipid raft-AKT signaling, which is influenced by TCHP, is noted in cancers such as prostate cancer and melanoma, where primary cilia abundance is reduced. This suggests that TCHP may be involved in cancer pathogenesis through its effects on lipid raft dynamics and AKT signaling (Nishimura2021Aurora).

## Interactions
Trichoplein (TCHP) is a keratin filament-binding protein that interacts with various proteins, playing a significant role in cytoskeletal organization and cell cycle regulation. TCHP binds specifically to keratin intermediate filaments, particularly K8/18, K16, and K18, but not to other intermediate filament proteins like vimentin, desmin, or neurofilaments (Nishizawa2005Identification). It colocalizes with K8/18 filaments in HeLa and Caco-2 cells, indicating a specific interaction with these keratin filaments (Nishizawa2005Identification).

TCHP also interacts with centrosomal proteins such as Odf2 and ninein, which are crucial for microtubule anchoring at the centrosome. This interaction is essential for the recruitment of ninein to the subdistal appendages of the mother centriole (Ibi2011Trichoplein). TCHP's interaction with Aurora A kinase (AURKA) at the centrosome is necessary for the suppression of primary cilium assembly, highlighting its role in cell cycle progression and centrosome function (NISHIMURA2019Intermediate; Nishimura2021Aurora).

Additionally, TCHP is involved in the regulation of genomic stability by interacting with the Mad2 protein, a key regulator of the spindle assembly checkpoint, which ensures accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis (Lauriola2020Depletion).
