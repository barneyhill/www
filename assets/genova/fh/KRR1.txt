# KRR1

## Overview
KRR1 is a gene that encodes the KRR1 small subunit processome component homolog, a protein integral to ribosome biogenesis. This protein is primarily involved in the assembly of the small ribosomal subunit, playing a crucial role in the processing and maturation of 18S rRNA within the nucleolus. The KRR1 protein contains tandem K homology (KH) domains, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, essential for its function in ribosome assembly. These interactions are vital for the formation and function of the small subunit processome (SSUP), a complex that enhances the translational capacity of cells, particularly in maintaining the pluripotency of embryonic stem cells (Singh2021Nucleolar; You2015Role). The conservation of KRR1 across eukaryotes underscores its fundamental role in cellular biology, with implications in cellular reprogramming and stem cell biology (Zheng2014Interaction; You2015Role).

## Structure
The KRR1 protein is a key component in ribosome assembly, specifically involved in the formation of the small ribosomal subunit. It contains tandem K homology (KH) domains, KH1 and KH2, which are crucial for its function. The KH1 domain, although lacking the typical RNA-binding GXXG motif, adopts a KH-like fold and is involved in protein-protein interactions, particularly with the assembly factor Kri1. The KH2 domain contains the classic GXXG motif, essential for nucleic acid interaction, and is expected to retain a classic RNA-binding mode (Zheng2014Interaction).

Structurally, both KH domains in KRR1 belong to the type I fold and are aligned in parallel, forming an extensive hydrophobic inter-domain interface that fuses them into an integral structure. This arrangement is distinct from other known tandem KH domains but resembles that of archaeal Dim2-like proteins (Zheng2014Interaction). The interaction between KRR1 and Faf1 involves a large number of hydrophobic, van der Waals, electrostatic, and hydrogen bond interactions, with a solvent-accessible area of 562 Å² per subunit (Zheng2014Interaction). The KRR1 protein is highly conserved across eukaryotes, indicating its essential role in ribosome biogenesis (Zheng2014Interaction).

## Function
KRR1 is a critical component of the small subunit processome (SSUP), which is involved in the biogenesis of the small ribosomal subunit in human cells. This protein plays a significant role in the processing and maturation of 18S rRNA, a crucial step in ribosome assembly. KRR1 is active in the nucleolus, where it participates in the processing of the 5' external transcribed spacer (ETS) of pre-rRNA, a function conserved across species from yeast to humans (Singh2021Nucleolar; You2015Role).

The SSUP, including KRR1, enhances the global translational capacity of cells, which is essential for maintaining the pluripotency of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). This enhancement supports the high protein synthesis rates required to sustain labile pluripotency factors such as Nanog and Esrrb (You2015Role). KRR1's involvement in ribosome biogenesis is crucial for maintaining the identity and pluripotency of ESCs by contributing to the general translational capacity (You2015Role).

KRR1 is also implicated in the efficient reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), indicating its broader role in cellular reprogramming and stem cell biology (You2015Role).

## Interactions
KRR1, a protein involved in ribosome biogenesis, participates in several critical interactions essential for the assembly of the small ribosomal subunit. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Krr1p forms a complex with Kri1p, which is crucial for their function in ribosome assembly. This interaction is necessary for the proper processing of pre-rRNAs, particularly for 18S rRNA, and defects in Krr1p lead to the accumulation of pre-rRNAs (Sasaki2000Yeast). Krr1p also interacts with Faf1, a nucleolar biogenesis factor, which is essential for the formation of the small ribosomal subunit. This interaction is crucial for maintaining a functional conformation of the 90S pre-ribosome particles (Zheng2014Interaction).

Krr1p is involved in the recruitment of ribosomal proteins Rps1 and Rps14, as well as the UTP-C complex, to the 90S pre-ribosome. This recruitment is essential for the early incorporation of these components into the pre-ribosome, highlighting Krr1p's role as a placeholder and recruiter in ribosome assembly (Sturm2017Interdependent). The interaction of Krr1p with Kap95p, involved in nuclear import, and a putative ribose methyltransferase, further underscores its multifaceted role in ribosome biogenesis (Gromadka2004Functional).
