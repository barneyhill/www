# YPEL1

## Overview
YPEL1 (yippee like 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and proliferation. The YPEL1 protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it plays a crucial role in mitosis and maintaining genomic stability. As a member of the YPEL gene family, which consists of five highly conserved genes (YPEL1-5), YPEL1 is implicated in developmental processes, particularly those related to craniofacial morphogenesis, through its regulation by bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. The protein's expression in structures derived from the pharyngeal arches, as well as in dermomyotomes and limb buds in chick models, suggests its involvement in developmental biology (Tan2015YPEL1). Additionally, YPEL1 has clinical significance in oncology, where its expression levels are associated with prognosis and treatment response in various cancers, including clear cell renal cell carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer (Wang2022Comprehensive; Wu2018Upregulation).

## Function
YPEL1 (yippee like 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cell cycle regulation and proliferation. The YPEL1 protein is associated with cellular processes such as mitosis and may play a role in maintaining genomic stability. It is typically active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to normal cell division and growth. In healthy human cells, YPEL1 is expressed in the nucleus, nucleoli, centrosome, and mitotic spindle, indicating its involvement in regulating the cytoskeletal and adhesion machinery (Tan2015YPEL1).

The gene is part of the YPEL gene family, which includes five highly conserved members (YPEL1-5). Although the biological function of these genes is not fully understood, YPEL1 has been implicated in the development of structures derived from the pharyngeal arches. In particular, YPEL1 expression is regulated by bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, suggesting a role in craniofacial development (Tan2015YPEL1). The gene's expression pattern in pharyngeal structures is similar between chick and mouse models, with additional expression in chick dermomyotomes and limb buds (Tan2015YPEL1). This spatial expression pattern supports its potential involvement in craniofacial morphogenesis and related developmental processes.

## Clinical Significance
YPEL1 has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), low expression levels of YPEL1 are associated with poor prognosis, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker. The gene is involved in the mesenchymal-epithelial transition, and its decreased expression correlates with poor outcomes in ccRCC patients (Wang2022Comprehensive). High expression of YPEL1 is linked to better overall survival and disease-specific survival in ccRCC, indicating its role in maintaining tumor characteristics and influencing the immune microenvironment (Wang2022Comprehensive).

In the context of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), YPEL1 is upregulated in response to erlotinib treatment, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used in EGFR-mutant NSCLC. This upregulation suggests a role in apoptosis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition processes, potentially influencing drug resistance and treatment outcomes (Wu2018Upregulation). The gene's expression changes are significant in the context of drug resistance, highlighting its potential involvement in the mechanisms of resistance to erlotinib (Wu2018Upregulation). These findings underscore the importance of YPEL1 in cancer prognosis and treatment response.
