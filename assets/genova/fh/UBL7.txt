# UBL7

## Overview
UBL7 is a gene that encodes the ubiquitin-like protein 7, which is primarily involved in the regulation of protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). This protein is characterized by the presence of ubiquitin-like (UBL) and ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains, which facilitate its interaction with various components of the proteasome and the valosin-containing protein (VCP) complex. UBL7 plays a critical role in spermiogenesis, the final stage of sperm cell development, by modulating the degradation of essential proteins and protecting them from excessive breakdown. It acts as a shuttling factor, interacting with proteasome ubiquitin receptors such as PSMD2 and PSMD4, and is involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway through its interaction with UBE4B. The protein's ability to bind ubiquitinated substrates and its potential promiscuous affinity for NEDD8 highlight its versatile role in cellular processes (Wang2024UBL7; Castagnoli2019Selectivity).

## Structure
UBL7 is a testis-enriched protein characterized by the presence of UBL (ubiquitin-like) and UBA (ubiquitin-associated) domains. The UBL domain of UBL7 adopts a typical ubiquitin fold, which is crucial for its interaction with other proteins, such as UBE4B, a component of the VCP/p97 complex (Wang2024UBL7). The UBA domain is involved in binding ubiquitinated substrates, allowing UBL7 to interact with a broad range of Ub-conjugated proteins (Wang2024UBL7).

UBL7's role in cellular processes is influenced by its ability to bind to proteasome Ub receptors, specifically PSMD2 and PSMD4, in a manner dependent on Ub-conjugates (Wang2024UBL7). This interaction is essential for its function in modulating the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) pathway, particularly in spermiogenesis, where it protects critical factors from excessive degradation (Wang2024UBL7).

While the specific molecular structure of UBL7 is not detailed, its functional domains and their interactions are highlighted as critical for its stability and function. UBL7 is also noted to have a potentially promiscuous binding affinity for NEDD8, influenced by mutations that make NEDD8 more similar to ubiquitin (Castagnoli2019Selectivity).

## Function
UBL7 (ubiquitin like 7) is a protein that plays a crucial role in spermiogenesis, the final stage of sperm cell development, by protecting critical factors from excessive degradation by proteasomes. It is part of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), which regulates protein degradation. UBL7 interacts with the valosin-containing protein (VCP) complex and proteasomes, acting as a shuttling factor that slows down the degradation of certain substrates. This function is essential for protecting critical factors involved in sperm development, such as those necessary for the formation of the manchette, head-tail coupling apparatus, and cytoplasmic droplets (Wang2024UBL7).

UBL7 interacts specifically with the proteasome ubiquitin (Ub) receptors PSMD2 and PSMD4, but not with ADRM1, in mammalian cells. This interaction is dependent on the presence of Ub-conjugates. UBL7 has been shown to bind directly to testis 26S proteasomes and slightly stimulate their peptidase activity, although its effect is much smaller compared to Ub chains (Wang2024UBL7). UBL7's role in the UPS involves both facilitating degradation and stabilizing substrates by protecting them from excessive degradation, ensuring successful sperm formation by preventing the degradation of essential proteins (Wang2024UBL7).

## Interactions
UBL7 interacts with several components of the proteasome and the VCP/p97 complex, playing a crucial role in spermiogenesis by protecting critical factors from excessive degradation. UBL7 specifically binds to the proteasome ubiquitin receptors PSMD2 and PSMD4 in mammalian cells, but not to ADRM1. This interaction is dependent on the presence of ubiquitin-conjugates. In germ cells, UBL7 can bind directly to isolated testis 26S proteasomes even in the absence of ubiquitin-conjugates, slightly stimulating their peptidase activity (Wang2024UBL7).

UBL7 also interacts with the VCP/p97 complex through UBE4B, a component of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. It binds to ubiquitinated substrates translocated by the VCP complex, with its UBL domain being crucial for this interaction (Wang2024UBL7). The study identified several proteins interacting with UBL7, including those involved in protein folding and stabilization processes, using FLAG-UBL7 immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry (Wang2024UBL7).

UBL7 acts as a shuttling factor between the substrate extraction machinery and the degradation center, retarding substrate degradation, which contrasts with typical UBL-UBA proteins that promote degradation (Wang2024UBL7).
