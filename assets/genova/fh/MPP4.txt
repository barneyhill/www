# MPP4

## Overview
MPP4 (membrane palmitoylated protein 4) is a gene that encodes the MAGUK p55 scaffold protein 4, a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family, specifically within the p55 subfamily. This protein functions as a molecular scaffold, playing a crucial role in the organization of presynaptic protein complexes in the retina, particularly at the photoreceptor ribbon synapse. The MPP4 protein is characterized by several domains, including L27, PDZ, SH3, and a guanylate kinase-like domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its role in synaptic organization. Predominantly expressed in the retina, MPP4 is essential for maintaining photoreceptor polarity and synaptic integrity, contributing to high-speed visual signal transmission. Despite its significant role in retinal physiology, mutations in the MPP4 gene have not been directly linked to severe retinal diseases, although they may contribute to mild retinopathies (Förster2009Proteomic; Aartsen2006Mpp4; Conte2002Characterization).

## Structure
The MPP4 protein is a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family, specifically within the p55 subfamily. It is composed of 637 amino acids and features several key domains that facilitate its function as a molecular scaffold. These domains include two N-terminal L27 domains, a PDZ domain, an SH3 domain, and a C-terminal guanylate kinase-like (GUK) domain (Stöhr2001Cloning; Aartsen2006Mpp4). The L27 domains are involved in protein-protein interactions, particularly in binding with other proteins such as Veli3 and Psd95, which are crucial for organizing protein complexes at the photoreceptor synapse (Förster2009Proteomic; Aartsen2006Mpp4).

MPP4 is predominantly expressed in the retina, where it localizes to the presynaptic vesicles and plasma membrane of photoreceptor synapses, playing a role in maintaining photoreceptor polarity and synaptic organization (Förster2009Proteomic; Aartsen2006Mpp4). A retina-specific isoform of MPP4 has been identified, which lacks 71 amino acids, including an L27 domain, due to the absence of exons 5 and 6 (Conte2002Characterization). This isoform highlights the potential for alternative splicing in the regulation of MPP4's function.

## Function
MPP4 (MAGUK p55 scaffold protein 4) is a retina-specific scaffolding protein that plays a critical role in organizing presynaptic protein complexes in the photoreceptor ribbon synapse, essential for high-speed visual signal transmission. It is part of a large network of proteins at the presynaptic plasma membrane, including adaptors, channels, and receptors, which are vital for normal ribbon synapse physiology (Förster2009Proteomic). MPP4 interacts with PSD-95, particularly the PSD-95β isoform, through the heterodimerization of their L27 domains, which is crucial for the proper localization and stabilization of plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPases (PMCAs) at the presynaptic plasma membrane (Chytła2020Not). 

In the retina, MPP4 is found in the synaptic terminals of cone and rod photoreceptors, as well as in postsynaptic structures in the outer plexiform layer and distinct bands in the inner plexiform layer, suggesting its role at membrane-cytoskeleton interfaces (Sto¨hr2003Cellular). MPP4 is involved in forming complexes with Lin-7 at the synaptic terminals of the outer plexiform layer, indicating its role in synaptic organization and function (Chytła2020Not). The protein is associated with membrane-bound cytoskeletal elements, contributing to the structural integrity of synaptic membranes and possibly synaptic signaling (Sto¨hr2003Cellular).

## Clinical Significance
The MPP4 gene, a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family, has been investigated for its potential role in retinal diseases, particularly retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Despite its high expression in the retina and its location near the autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa 26 (RP26) locus, mutation analysis in patients with RP has not identified any pathological mutations in the MPP4 gene, suggesting it is unlikely to be directly involved in RP (Conte2002Characterization). 

Studies in Mpp4 knockout mice have shown that while the absence of Mpp4 does not lead to significant retinal degeneration, it does result in impaired synaptic transmission and altered calcium homeostasis at rod photoreceptor synaptic terminals. This suggests that Mpp4 mutations might contribute to mild retinopathies rather than severe retinal diseases (Yang2007Mpp4; Aartsen2006Mpp4). The gene's role in maintaining calcium homeostasis and synaptic function indicates that defects in Mpp4 could manifest as reduced electroretinogram (ERG) b-waves and loss of oscillatory potentials, potentially impacting visual processing (Yang2007Mpp4).

## Interactions
MPP4, a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family, is involved in various protein interactions crucial for its function in the retina. MPP4 interacts with PSD95 and Veli3, forming a complex at the photoreceptor synapse. This interaction is mediated through the L27 domains, which facilitate the recruitment of these proteins to the presynaptic membranes (Förster2009Proteomic; Aartsen2006Mpp4). The interaction with PSD95 is particularly significant, as MPP4 influences the turnover and membrane targeting of PSD95, although it does not affect the transcriptional levels of PSD95 mRNA (Aartsen2006Mpp4).

MPP4 also interacts with other proteins such as Dlg1, although this interaction does not appear to be essential for the localization of Crb complex members at the outer limiting membrane (Aartsen2006Mpp4). In addition, MPP4 is associated with plasma membrane calcium ATPases (PMCAs) at the synaptic terminals of rod and cone photoreceptors, playing a role in calcium homeostasis and synaptic transmission (Yang2007Mpp4).

The interactions of MPP4 with Veli proteins, including Veli1, Veli2, and Veli3, are facilitated by the L27C heterodimerization domain, which is crucial for binding (Stöhr2004Membraneassociated). These interactions highlight MPP4's role in organizing protein complexes at the photoreceptor synapse, contributing to synaptic plasticity and signal transmission in the retina.
