# CLEC4D

## Overview
CLEC4D, also known as Dectin-3, is a gene that encodes the protein C-type lectin domain family 4 member D, a type II transmembrane receptor. This protein is part of the C-type lectin receptor family, which plays a pivotal role in the immune system by recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns. CLEC4D is primarily expressed on myeloid cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, and is involved in the immune response against fungal pathogens, notably through its interaction with mannan, a component of fungal cell walls (Hole2016Antifungal; Zhu2013CType). The protein's structure includes a C-type lectin-like domain essential for carbohydrate recognition, and it can form heterodimers with other receptors, enhancing its ligand-binding capabilities (Furukawa2013Structural; Zhu2013CType). CLEC4D's interactions with other proteins, such as DAP12 and MINCLE, further modulate immune responses, highlighting its significance in pathogen recognition and inflammatory processes (Scur2023The; Zhang2021CLEC4s). Understanding the function and interactions of CLEC4D is crucial for elucidating its role in immune regulation and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Structure
CLEC4D, also known as Dectin-3, is a C-type lectin receptor involved in the immune response. It is a type II transmembrane protein characterized by a single extracellular C-type lectin-like domain, which is crucial for its carbohydrate recognition function (Zhu2013CType). The protein structure includes a stalk region and a transmembrane region, with a short cytoplasmic tail that lacks signaling motifs (Zhu2013CType). 

The tertiary structure of CLEC4D features a typical C-type lectin receptor fold, consisting of 2 α-helices and 11 β-strands, and contains one calcium ion essential for carbohydrate recognition (Furukawa2013Structural). This structure is similar to other C-type lectin receptors but exhibits unique conformations near the Ca2+-binding motif, which are important for its function (Furukawa2013Structural).

CLEC4D can form heterodimers with other receptors, such as Dectin-2, enhancing its ligand-binding capabilities and immune response functions (Zhu2013CType). The protein is expressed in high amounts in peritoneal macrophages, bone marrow, and the spleen, indicating its significant role in immune surveillance (Zhu2013CType). The presence of a hydrophobic patch adjacent to the carbohydrate binding site suggests a role in recognizing the fatty acid chains of glycolipids (Furukawa2013Structural).

## Function
CLEC4D, also known as Dectin-3, is a C-type lectin receptor primarily expressed on myeloid cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells. It functions as a pattern recognition receptor, playing a crucial role in the immune response by recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns. In the context of fungal infections, CLEC4D is essential for the antifungal activity of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) against Cryptococcus neoformans. It facilitates the recognition and uptake of the fungus, which is critical for inhibiting its growth (Hole2016Antifungal).

CLEC4D recognizes mannan, a component of the fungal cell wall, and is involved in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are necessary for the antifungal response of pDCs (Hole2016Antifungal). Although CLEC4D is crucial for the recognition and inhibition of fungal growth, its specific function in healthy human cells outside of immune responses to fungal infections is not detailed in the available context (Hole2016Antifungal). The receptor can also form a heterodimer with Dectin-2, suggesting a broader role in immune responses against various pathogens (Hole2016Antifungal).

## Clinical Significance
CLEC4D, a member of the C-type lectin domain family, plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses. Alterations in the expression of CLEC4D or mutations within this gene can significantly impact immune system function. Such changes may contribute to the development of inflammatory diseases, autoimmune disorders, or increased susceptibility to infections. The gene's involvement in pathogen recognition and immune signaling underscores its importance in clinical research, as these processes are vital for maintaining immune homeostasis and responding to pathogenic threats. Disruptions in CLEC4D's normal interactions can lead to an impaired immune response, potentially exacerbating conditions characterized by chronic inflammation or autoimmunity. Understanding the clinical implications of CLEC4D mutations and expression alterations is essential for developing targeted therapies aimed at modulating immune responses in affected individuals.

## Interactions
CLEC4D, a member of the C-type lectin domain family, is involved in immune responses and interacts with other proteins to modulate these processes. It is known to form a receptor complex with DAP12, which transmits activating signals in immune cells. This interaction plays a crucial role in pathogen recognition and the modulation of inflammatory responses (Zhang2021CLEC4s).

CLEC4D is also associated with the MINCLE receptor (Clec4e), forming heterodimers that enhance phagocytosis and ligand affinity. This interaction is significant in the immune response to pathogens, as it typically results in inflammation through the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (Scur2023The). The coupling of CLEC4D with MINCLE promotes its cell surface expression and signaling, which is crucial for recognizing necrotic cell patterns and mycobacterial lipids (Clément2016Necrotic).

While the context does not provide specific information on interactions with nucleic acids, the involvement of CLEC4D in immune cell signaling and pathogen recognition highlights its importance in immune system regulation and potential as a therapeutic target in diseases such as hepatocellular carcinoma (Zhang2021CLEC4s).
