# ZFP36

## Overview
ZFP36 is a gene that encodes the tristetraprolin (TTP) protein, a CCCH-type zinc finger protein involved in post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA stability. The protein is characterized by its tandem zinc finger (TZF) domain, which enables it to bind to adenine- and uridine-rich elements (AREs) in the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of target mRNAs, promoting their degradation. This RNA-binding protein plays a critical role in modulating immune responses and inflammation by regulating the expression of cytokines and inflammatory mediators (Blackshear2005Tandem; Maeda2017Regulation). ZFP36 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with mRNA decay complexes and other proteins to facilitate mRNA turnover. Its activity is regulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its ability to bind mRNA and recruit decay enzymes (Fu2016RNA-binding). Alterations in ZFP36 expression have been implicated in various cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Zhu2015Prognostic; Montorsi2016Loss).

## Structure
The ZFP36 gene encodes the tristetraprolin (TTP) protein, which is characterized by its tandem zinc finger (TZF) domain, crucial for binding to AU-rich elements in mRNA. The primary structure of ZFP36 includes two CCCH-type zinc finger motifs, each consisting of three cysteines and one histidine, following a specific C-X8-C-X5-C-X3-H pattern (Blackshear2005Tandem). These motifs are essential for the protein's RNA-binding capability and are highly conserved across species (Lai2019The).

The secondary structure of ZFP36 is defined by the zinc finger motifs, which form stable folds necessary for RNA interaction. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these motifs to create a functional RNA-binding domain. The TZF domain undergoes a conformational change upon RNA binding, which is facilitated by stacking interactions between aromatic residues and RNA bases (Blackshear2005Tandem).

ZFP36 can form homodimers, indicating a quaternary structure that may be important for its function in mRNA decay (Blackshear2005Tandem). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, regulate the activity and stability of the protein, affecting its ability to bind and destabilize mRNA (Blackshear2005Tandem).

## Function
ZFP36, also known as tristetraprolin (TTP), is a CCCH-type zinc finger protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of mRNA stability in human cells. It primarily functions by binding to adenine- and uridine-rich elements (AREs) located in the 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) of target mRNAs, promoting their deadenylation and subsequent degradation. This activity is essential for controlling the expression of various cytokines and inflammatory mediators, thereby modulating immune responses and inflammation (Lai1999Evidence; Maeda2017Regulation).

In healthy cells, ZFP36 is involved in a negative feedback loop that regulates the production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) by destabilizing its mRNA, thus preventing excessive inflammatory responses. This regulatory mechanism is critical for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing conditions such as cachexia, arthritis, and autoimmunity, which are observed in TTP-deficient mice (Lai2002Interactions; Carballo1998Feedback).

ZFP36 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with mRNA decay complexes to facilitate mRNA turnover. Its activity is modulated by phosphorylation, which can affect its ability to bind mRNA and recruit decay enzymes, thus influencing its regulatory functions in cytokine production (Fu2016RNA-binding; Maeda2017Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ZFP36 gene, also known as tristetraprolin (TTP), have been implicated in various cancers. In colorectal cancer (CRC), ZFP36 acts as a tumor suppressor, and its expression is often lost during cancer progression. This loss is associated with increased activity of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and enhanced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), processes that are crucial for cancer metastasis (Montorsi2016Loss). Restoring ZFP36 expression in CRC cell lines has been shown to inhibit EMT and increase susceptibility to anoikis, a form of programmed cell death, by downregulating oncogenic targets such as SOX9, MACC1, and ZEB1 (Montorsi2016Loss).

In breast cancer, decreased expression of ZFP36 is linked to increased invasiveness and metastasis. The ZFP36*2 A > G polymorphism, located in the promoter region of the gene, can lead to reduced expression of ZFP36, correlating with poor prognosis in Caucasian breast cancer patients (Upadhyay2012Genetic). This polymorphism is associated with increased expression of COX-2, a gene involved in breast cancer pathogenesis (Upadhyay2012Genetic).

In prostate cancer, lower ZFP36 expression is associated with higher Gleason scores and poorer clinical outcomes, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Zhu2015Prognostic).

## Interactions
ZFP36, also known as tristetraprolin (TTP), is an RNA-binding protein that interacts with AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of target mRNAs, promoting their degradation. It forms part of a regulatory network involving other RNA-binding proteins such as ELAVL1 (HuR), with which it shares overlapping binding sites in the 3' UTRs of mRNAs. This overlap suggests a potential for combinatorial regulation of mRNAs containing AREs by both ZFP36 and ELAVL1 (Mukherjee2014Global).

ZFP36 also interacts with the autophagy-related protein complex ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1, inhibiting its formation and thereby blocking autophagy flux. This interaction is significant in the context of ferroptosis, a form of programmed cell death, where ZFP36 overexpression confers resistance by modulating autophagy and iron metabolism pathways (Zhang2019RNAbinding).

In addition to its interactions with mRNA, ZFP36 is involved in mRNA decay through its interaction with the CCR4-NOT complex, a key player in mRNA deadenylation. This interaction is crucial for its role in mRNA decay, although ZFP36 can also repress translation independently of deadenylation (Otsuka2020AREbinding). These interactions highlight ZFP36's multifaceted role in post-transcriptional regulation.
