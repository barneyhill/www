# DDR2

## Overview
DDR2 (discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase 2) is a gene that encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in various cellular processes, particularly those related to bone and cartilage development. The DDR2 protein is characterized by its unique structure, which includes an extracellular discoidin domain, a transmembrane helix, and an intracellular kinase domain, allowing it to function as a transmembrane receptor. This receptor is primarily activated by binding to fibrillar collagens, which triggers downstream signaling pathways essential for osteoblast differentiation and chondrocyte maturation (Borza2022Genetic; AlKindi2014A). DDR2 plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity of connective tissues and is implicated in various pathological conditions, including skeletal disorders and certain cancers, due to its involvement in extracellular matrix remodeling and cell signaling (Mariadoss2023Exploring; Zhang2010An).

## Structure
DDR2 (discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase 2) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that features a distinct molecular structure. The protein is composed of an extracellular discoidin domain, a transmembrane helix, and an intracellular kinase domain. The extracellular region includes a discoidin homology (DS) domain followed by a DS-like domain, which is unique to DDRs and essential for collagen binding (Borza2022Genetic; AlKindi2014A). DDR2 exists as preformed homodimers on the cell membrane, even in the absence of collagen, and is activated by fibrillar collagens (AlKindi2014A).

The juxtamembrane (JM) domain of DDR2 includes an extracellular JM region of approximately 30 amino acids and a larger cytosolic JM region of about 142 amino acids (Chen2021Recent). The kinase domain is capped by a short C-terminal peptide of about 6 amino acids (Chen2021Recent). DDR2 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at specific tyrosine residues, which are crucial for its activation and function (Iwai2013Phosphoproteomics). Glycosylation is another modification that affects DDR2's intracellular trafficking and function (AlKindi2014A). DDR2 does not have multiple isoforms, unlike DDR1, which has several splice variants (Borza2022Genetic).

## Function
DDR2 (discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase 2) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a crucial role in various cellular and molecular processes, particularly in bone and cartilage development. It is primarily involved in osteoblast differentiation and chondrocyte maturation, processes essential for skeletal development. DDR2 expression is induced by osteogenic stimuli and is associated with increased expression of osteogenic markers such as collagen I, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and osteocalcin (OCN) (Zhang2010An). DDR2 activation enhances osteogenic differentiation by modulating the phosphorylation and activity of Runx2, a key transcription factor in bone development, through the ERK MAPK signaling pathway (Zhang2010An).

DDR2 is expressed in connective tissues derived from the mesoderm and is involved in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of bone and cartilage. It interacts with specific types of collagen, particularly collagen X, which is crucial for long bone growth and endochondral ossification (Mariadoss2023Exploring). DDR2 also plays a role in extracellular matrix remodeling by influencing matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity, which is important for collagen turnover and tissue repair (Ferri2004Role). Its activity is essential for normal bone growth, as evidenced by skeletal abnormalities in DDR2-deficient models (Zhang2010An).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the DDR2 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In skeletal development, DDR2 mutations can lead to spondylo-meta-epiphyseal dysplasia (SMED), characterized by short limbs, abnormal calcifications, and severe skeletal abnormalities. These mutations disrupt normal bone growth and chondrocyte function, leading to conditions such as dwarfism and other skeletal deformities (Mariadoss2023Exploring; Mohamed2022The; AlKindi2014A).

In the context of cancer, DDR2 mutations are implicated in lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a subtype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Specific mutations, such as S131C, have been shown to promote cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, contributing to cancer progression. DDR2 mutations are present in approximately 3-4% of lung SCC cases and have been identified as potential therapeutic targets, with some patients responding to treatments like dasatinib (Ricordel2018Mutational; Miao2014Identification).

DDR2 is also involved in osteoarthritis, where its increased expression is linked to cartilage degradation through the release of matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13). Targeting DDR2 may offer therapeutic potential in slowing the progression of osteoarthritis and reducing inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis (Mariadoss2023Exploring).

## Interactions
DDR2 (discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase 2) is known to participate in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cell signaling and cancer progression. DDR2 interacts with SHP-2, a protein that is tyrosine-phosphorylated downstream of DDR2 activation. This interaction is significant in the context of DDR2 signaling pathways, particularly in lung cancer, where SHP-2 acts as a key signaling node (Iwai2013Phosphoproteomics).

The intracellular juxtamembrane domain (JM2) of DDR2 is essential for receptor activation and dimerization, which are necessary for its function. The JM2 domain facilitates DDR2 dimerization, a process critical for collagen-induced activation of the receptor (Kim2014The). DDR2 also interacts with Src kinase, which is required for maximal DDR2 kinase activity. This interaction is highlighted by the maintenance of Src phosphorylation in DDR2-transformed cell lines, suggesting a collaborative role in DDR2-driven transformation (Hammerman2011Mutations).

DDR2's interaction with collagen is mediated through its extracellular domain, which binds to fibrillar collagen and collagen X, leading to the phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues and subsequent activation of downstream signaling pathways (Rammal2016Discoidin). These interactions underscore DDR2's involvement in processes such as cell migration and invasion, particularly in cancerous contexts.
