# C2CD6

## Overview
C2CD6 is a gene that encodes the protein C2 calcium-dependent domain containing 6, which plays a crucial role in sperm function and male fertility. The protein is a component of the CatSper calcium channel complex, essential for sperm motility, and is specifically localized to the principal piece of the sperm flagellum. C2CD6 contains a calcium-dependent membrane-targeting C2 domain, which is involved in the assembly and localization of the CatSper complex. The protein exists in two isoforms, C2CD6S and C2CD6L, resulting from alternative splicing, and is characterized by its interactions with core subunits of the CatSper channel, such as CatSper1, CatSper3, CatSper4, and EFCAB9, but not with CatSperZ (Yang2021C2CD6). These interactions are vital for the structural organization of the channel, and the absence of C2CD6 leads to disorganized CatSper channels and impaired sperm hyperactivation, resulting in male infertility (Pereira2023Morphological; Yang2021C2CD6). Additionally, C2CD6 is implicated in intracellular transportation processes, interacting with proteins involved in vesicle transportation and ciliary trafficking (Hwang2021C2cd6encoded).

## Structure
The C2CD6 protein is a component of sperm flagella, specifically localizing to the principal piece of the sperm flagellum. It is encoded by the C2cd6 gene, which is conserved in vertebrates and is testis-specific. C2CD6 appears in two major isoforms: C2CD6S (short, ~60 kD) and C2CD6L (long, ~85 kD), resulting from alternative splicing. The C2cd6s transcript consists of 13 exons encoding a protein of 557 amino acids, while the C2cd6l transcript encodes a protein of 691 amino acids. Both isoforms share the first 533 amino acids and contain a predicted calcium-binding membrane targeting domain, known as the C2 domain, which is common in signaling proteins that interact with cellular membranes (Yang2021C2CD6).

The C2CD6 protein does not contain predicted transmembrane domains. It is tyrosine phosphorylated upon capacitation, although the physiological consequences of this modification are unknown (Yang2021C2CD6). The protein's role as a structural subunit, membrane-targeting facilitator, or calcium sensor for the CatSper channel is suggested by its interactions with the core alpha subunits of CatSper and EFCAB9, but not with CatSperZ (Yang2021C2CD6).

## Function
The C2CD6 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the CatSper calcium channel complex, which is essential for sperm function and male fertility. C2CD6 contains a calcium-dependent membrane-targeting C2 domain, which facilitates its role in the assembly and localization of the CatSper complex along the sperm flagellum (Yang2021C2CD6). This protein interacts with core subunits of the CatSper channel, such as CatSper1, CatSper3, CatSper4, and EFCAB9, but not with CatSperz, indicating its specific role in the structural organization of the channel (Yang2021C2CD6).

C2CD6 is crucial for the proper incorporation of the CatSper complex into sperm flagella, and its absence leads to disorganized CatSper channels, resulting in impaired sperm hyperactivation and male infertility (Pereira2023Morphological; Yang2021C2CD6). The protein is localized specifically to the principal piece of the sperm flagellum, particularly at the annulus region, and is tyrosine phosphorylated during sperm capacitation, although the physiological consequences of this phosphorylation remain unclear (Yang2021C2CD6). C2CD6's role as a potential calcium sensor, possibly in conjunction with EFCAB9, further underscores its importance in sperm motility and fertilization (Yang2021C2CD6).

## Clinical Significance
The C2CD6 gene has been implicated in several medical conditions, although its clinical significance is not fully understood. In the context of male infertility, a homozygous missense variant (c.338A > G; p.(His113Arg)) in the C2CD6 gene was identified in a patient with globozoospermia, a condition affecting sperm morphology. This variant affects a conserved amino acid in the ALS2CR11 domain, suggesting a potential link to acrosome biology, which is crucial for sperm development and function (Oud2020Exome). However, the pathogenicity of this variant remains uncertain, and further research is needed to clarify its role in globozoospermia.

In the realm of cardiovascular diseases, C2CD6 was found to be upregulated in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), with a log2 fold change of 1.55 and a p-adjusted value of 0.047. This suggests that C2CD6 may play a role in the pathophysiology of HCM, although specific diseases or conditions associated with mutations or alterations in C2CD6 are not detailed (Kiselev2022Novel).

Despite these findings, the specific clinical associations of C2CD6 mutations or expression alterations are not well-documented, and ongoing research aims to elucidate its role in disease mechanisms.

## Interactions
The C2CD6 protein, also known as CatSperτ, is a critical component of the CatSper calcium channel complex in sperm. It interacts with several key proteins within this complex, including the core alpha subunits CatSper1, CatSper2, CatSper3, and CatSper4, as well as EFCAB9, a pH-dependent calcium sensor. These interactions are essential for the proper assembly and function of the CatSper channel, which is crucial for sperm motility and fertility (Yang2021C2CD6).

C2CD6 does not interact with CatSperZ (TEX40), a partner of EFCAB9, indicating specificity in its interactions within the CatSper complex (Yang2021C2CD6). The protein is also associated with TRIM69, an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, suggesting a role in post-translational modification and channel targeting (Hwang2021C2cd6encoded; Zhao20223D).

C2CD6 interacts with a wide array of proteins involved in vesicle transportation and ciliary trafficking, such as ARF5, RAB11B, and motor proteins like MYO6 and MYO7A. These interactions facilitate the targeting and transport of the CatSper channel to the flagellar membrane, highlighting C2CD6's role as a molecular linker in intracellular transportation (Hwang2021C2cd6encoded).
