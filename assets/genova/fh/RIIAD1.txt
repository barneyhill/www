# RIIAD1

## Overview
RIIAD1 is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the PKA-R superfamily, specifically associated with the type II PKA regulatory subunit-like D/D proteins. This protein plays a significant role in the regulation of protein kinase A (PKA) activity, which is crucial for various cellular signaling pathways. The RIIAD1-encoded protein is implicated in processes related to sperm motility and is co-expressed with genes linked to male fertility, such as a-kinase anchor protein 3 (AKAP3) (Loers2022SUBATOMIC:; Dahlin2021Beyond). Additionally, its association with motile cilia suggests a role in cilium or flagellum-dependent cell motility, highlighting its potential involvement in cellular compartmentalization and movement (Loers2022SUBATOMIC:). While the specific functions of RIIAD1 in healthy human cells are not fully elucidated, its classification within the PKA-R superfamily underscores its importance in cellular organization and signaling.

## Structure


## Function
RIIAD1 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of protein kinase A (PKA) activity, which plays a crucial role in various cellular signaling pathways. The protein is part of the PKA-R superfamily, specifically associated with the type II PKA regulatory subunit-like D/D proteins (Dahlin2021Beyond). RIIAD1 is hypothesized to be involved in sperm motility, as it appears in gene modules enriched with terms related to sperm capacitation and motility, and is co-expressed with a-kinase anchor protein 3 (AKAP3), a gene linked to male infertility when knocked down in mice (Loers2022SUBATOMIC:).

The protein's involvement in cellular processes is further supported by its association with the motile cilium, a cellular component crucial for movement, suggesting a role in cilium or flagellum-dependent cell motility (Loers2022SUBATOMIC:). Although specific functional details of RIIAD1 in healthy human cells are not extensively documented, its classification within the PKA-R superfamily indicates a potential role in the structural organization and signaling within cells, particularly in contexts requiring motility and cellular compartmentalization (Dahlin2021Beyond).

## Clinical Significance
The RIIAD1 gene has been implicated in various conditions through alterations in its expression levels. In moyamoya disease, a cerebrovascular disorder, RIIAD1 is significantly upregulated, with a fold change of 2.2, suggesting its potential involvement in the disease's pathophysiology (Kanamori2021Transcriptomewide). In the context of cancer, RIIAD1 has been identified as part of upregulated pathways in studies examining the RAB39A-RXRB axis, which is associated with cancer development and stemness (Chano2018Prominent). Additionally, RIIAD1 expression is noted in breast cancer, where it is upregulated in association with the SIX1 gene, which is involved in tumorigenesis and cancer progression (Guo2023SIX1).

Furthermore, species-specific exon loss events in RIIAD1 have been observed, which may affect its translational efficiency in humans. This loss occurs in the 5' untranslated region, potentially increasing the gene's translational efficiency by removing upstream open reading frames that typically repress translation (Wang2014SpeciesSpecific). These findings suggest that changes in RIIAD1 expression and exon structure could have significant implications for its role in human diseases. However, specific diseases directly caused by RIIAD1 mutations or expression alterations have not been extensively documented.
