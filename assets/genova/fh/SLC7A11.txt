# SLC7A11

## Overview
SLC7A11 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 7 member 11, also known as xCT, which is a transmembrane protein integral to the cystine/glutamate antiporter system, system Xc-. This protein plays a pivotal role in cellular redox homeostasis by facilitating the exchange of extracellular cystine for intracellular glutamate, a process crucial for the synthesis of glutathione, a major antioxidant. The SLC7A11 protein is characterized by its 12 transmembrane domains and forms a functional heterodimer with SLC3A2, a membrane glycoprotein, which is essential for its stability and localization in the plasma membrane (Koppula2020Cystine; Jiang2024SLC7A11:). While not essential for normal development, as evidenced by viable Slc7a11 knockout mice, SLC7A11 is critical in protecting cells from oxidative stress and has significant implications in cancer biology, where its overexpression is associated with tumor growth and resistance to cell death (Koppula2020Cystine; Jyotsana2022The).

## Structure
The SLC7A11 protein, also known as xCT, is a transmembrane protein that functions as part of the cystine/glutamate antiporter system, system Xc-. It is composed of 502 amino acids and features 12 transmembrane domains, with both its N- and C-termini located intracellularly (Tang2021Research; Jiang2024SLC7A11:). The primary structure of SLC7A11 includes these amino acid sequences that form the transmembrane domains, which are highly hydrophobic (Sato1999Cloning).

The secondary structure of SLC7A11 likely includes alpha-helices typical of membrane proteins, facilitating its integration into the lipid bilayer. The tertiary structure involves the arrangement of these helices within the membrane, allowing the protein to function effectively as a transporter (Koppula2018Amino).

In terms of quaternary structure, SLC7A11 forms a heterodimer with SLC3A2 (CD98 or 4F2hc), a type 2 membrane glycoprotein with a single transmembrane domain. The two subunits are linked by a disulfide bond between Cys 158 of SLC7A11 and Cys 109 of SLC3A2, which is crucial for the transporter's function (Koppula2020Cystine; Jiang2024SLC7A11:). This interaction is essential for the stability and proper localization of SLC7A11 within the cell membrane (Koppula2018Amino).

## Function
The SLC7A11 gene encodes a transmembrane protein that functions as a cystine/glutamate antiporter, playing a crucial role in maintaining redox homeostasis in healthy human cells. This protein is part of the system Xc-, which facilitates the uptake of extracellular cystine in exchange for intracellular glutamate. Once inside the cell, cystine is reduced to cysteine, a precursor for the synthesis of glutathione (GSH), a major antioxidant that protects cells from oxidative stress (Galluccio2022Production; Liu2021NADPH; Jiang2024SLC7A11:).

SLC7A11 is primarily active in the plasma membrane and forms a heterodimer with the heavy chain subunit SLC3A2, which stabilizes the transporter and aids in its localization (Galluccio2022Production; Koppula2020Cystine). The activity of SLC7A11 is essential for maintaining cellular redox balance by ensuring a steady supply of cysteine for GSH production, which is vital for detoxifying reactive oxygen species (ROS) and supporting cell survival (Liu2021NADPH; Jiang2024SLC7A11:).

In healthy cells, SLC7A11's function is not essential for normal development, as evidenced by the viability of Slc7a11 knockout mice, suggesting that other pathways can compensate for its absence (Jyotsana2022The). However, its role in redox regulation is critical for protecting cells from oxidative damage and maintaining cellular health (Jiang2024SLC7A11:).

## Clinical Significance
The SLC7A11 gene, encoding a cystine transporter, plays a significant role in cancer biology by influencing ferroptosis, a form of programmed cell death. Its overexpression is linked to poor prognosis in various cancers, including lung cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, liver cancer, and glioma (Koppula2020Cystine). In these cancers, SLC7A11 overexpression leads to increased cystine uptake and glutathione biosynthesis, suppressing ferroptosis and supporting tumor growth (Koppula2020Cystine). Conversely, inhibition of SLC7A11 can induce ferroptosis and reduce tumor growth, making it a potential therapeutic target (Koppula2020Cystine).

In adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), high SLC7A11 expression is associated with poor prognosis and shorter survival, serving as an independent prognostic factor (Liu2023Exploring). The gene's expression is also linked to immune cell infiltration and drug resistance, affecting the tumor microenvironment and response to therapy (Liu2023Exploring).

SLC7A11's role in cancer extends to its involvement in chemoresistance, as its overexpression is associated with resistance to therapies like chemotherapy and radiotherapy (Jyotsana2022The). Targeting SLC7A11 can reverse therapeutic resistance and induce ferroptosis, offering a potential treatment strategy (Jyotsana2022The).

## Interactions
SLC7A11, also known as xCT, is a component of the cystine/glutamate antiporter system x_c^-, and it interacts with several proteins that influence its stability and function. One key interaction is with SLC3A2, also known as CD98, which forms a heterodimer with SLC7A11. This interaction is crucial for the stability and trafficking of SLC7A11 to the plasma membrane, as SLC3A2 acts as a chaperone protein (Koppula2018Amino; Galluccio2022Production).

SLC7A11 also interacts with CD44 variant isoforms (CD44v), which stabilize SLC7A11 and maintain its cell surface localization. This interaction is important for the protein's stability, and CD44v deficiency can lead to reduced SLC7A11 stability and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Koppula2018Amino; Jyotsana2022The).

The protein is subject to post-translational regulation through interactions with OTUB1, a deubiquitinating enzyme that prevents SLC7A11's ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, thereby stabilizing it (Koppula2020Cystine). Additionally, SLC7A11 interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which helps maintain its localization on the plasma membrane, enhancing cystine uptake and promoting tumor growth (Koppula2020Cystine; Jyotsana2022The).
