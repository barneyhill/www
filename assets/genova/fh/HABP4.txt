# HABP4

## Overview
HABP4, or hyaluronan binding protein 4, is a gene that encodes an intracellular protein involved in various cellular processes, including transcription regulation, RNA splicing, and the DNA damage response. The protein encoded by HABP4 is characterized as an intrinsically unstructured protein (IUP), which allows it to interact flexibly with multiple molecular targets, acting as a hub in cellular signaling networks (Colleti2019Complex). This protein is involved in the regulation of gene expression and cellular stress responses, and it plays a role in maintaining genomic stability through its interactions with proteins involved in DNA repair pathways (Colleti2019Complex). HABP4's function is modulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, methylation, and SUMOylation, which influence its cellular localization and interaction with other proteins (Colleti2019Complex). The gene has clinical significance, particularly in cancer biology, where its expression levels and interactions are linked to tumorigenesis and cancer progression (Liu2021Let7i5p; Colleti2019Complex).

## Structure
The human gene HABP4 encodes the intracellular hyaluronic acid binding protein 4, which is characterized by a high level of disorder-promoting amino acids, a high net charge, and a low mean hydropathy value in its amino acid composition. These features are typical of intrinsically unstructured proteins (IUPs), which lack a stable hydrophobic core or regular secondary structure (Colleti2019Complex). The C-terminal region of HABP4 is described as an elongated monomer in solution, resembling a premolten globule of 37 kDa, indicating a flexible structure without a stable core (Colleti2019Complex). Circular dichroism experiments suggest that HABP4 typically exhibits a random coil or denatured protein spectrum, but it can gain secondary structure upon interaction with other molecules, such as in the presence of 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) (Colleti2019Complex).

HABP4 undergoes several post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation by protein kinase C at specific threonine residues and arginine methylation mediated by PRMT1, which influence its cellular distribution and interactions (Colleti2019Complex). Additionally, HABP4 has predicted SUMOylation sites, with confirmed SUMOylation affecting its interaction partners and biological processes (Colleti2019Complex). These modifications suggest a role in various cellular processes, including transcription regulation and RNA splicing (Colleti2019Complex). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, such as specific domains or prominent folds, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
HABP4, also known as hyaluronan binding protein 4, is involved in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It interacts with negatively charged molecules such as glycosaminoglycans and RNA, suggesting a role in cellular functions like translation, RNA recognition, transcriptional regulation, cell cycle control, and protein complex assembly (Colleti2019Complex). HABP4 is characterized as an intrinsically unstructured protein, which allows it to bind multiple targets and facilitate complex assembly, acting as a hub in signaling networks (Colleti2019Complex).

HABP4 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it is associated with nuclear substructures involved in ribosome biogenesis and pre-mRNA splicing (Colleti2019Complex). It interacts with proteins related to translational regulation and co-localizes with TIA1 in stress granules, indicating a role in stress response and translation (Colleti2019Complex). The protein also plays a role in the DNA damage response, interacting with proteins involved in DNA repair pathways, which suggests its involvement in maintaining genomic stability (Colleti2019Complex).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, methylation, and SUMOylation influence HABP4's interactions and cellular localization, further modulating its function in processes like transcription regulation and apoptosis (Colleti2019Complex).

## Clinical Significance
HABP4 is implicated in various cancers due to its role in gene expression regulation, cell cycle control, and apoptosis. Alterations in HABP4 expression are associated with acute myeloid leukemia and colon neoplasia, where it is involved in secondary chromosomal aberrations (Colleti2019Complex). In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), HABP4 acts as a tumor suppressor. Its downregulation, influenced by the microRNA let-7i-5p, correlates with increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, contributing to poor prognosis in ccRCC patients (Liu2021Let7i5p).

HABP4's interactions with proteins involved in pre-mRNA splicing, such as SFRS9 and hnRNPQ, suggest its role in cancer development through altered splicing and gene expression (Colleti2019Complex). Over-expression of HABP4 in certain cell lines leads to changes in gene expression related to proliferation and apoptosis, indicating its potential impact on tumorigenesis (Colleti2019Complex). The gene's involvement in DNA damage response and repair pathways further underscores its significance in cancer biology (Colleti2019Complex). These findings highlight HABP4's potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
HABP4 (hyaluronan binding protein 4) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with several proteins involved in transcriptional regulation and RNA metabolism, including CHD-3, DAXX, HMG, p53, TOPORS, TIP60, CIRBP, YB1, NSEP-1, SFRS9, SF2, and FXRP (MeloHanchuk2020Intracellular). HABP4 is phosphorylated by various PKC isoforms, particularly PKCθ, which affects its interactions with nuclear proteins such as RACK1 and CHD3 (Colleti2019Complex). It also undergoes SUMOylation, interacting with proteins like UBC9, PIAS3, and TOPORS, and has seven predicted SUMOylation sites (Colleti2019Complex).

HABP4 interacts with p53, reducing its transcriptional activity, and is involved in the formation of promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) in a p53-dependent manner (Colleti2019Complex). It also interacts with proteins involved in DNA damage response pathways, such as UBC9, DAXX, PIAS, GADD34, and YB-1, suggesting a role in DNA repair processes (Colleti2019Complex). These interactions highlight HABP4's role as a regulatory hub in cellular signaling and gene expression.
