# RS1

## Overview
The RS1 gene encodes the retinoschisin 1 protein, a crucial extracellular adhesive protein involved in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the retina. Retinoschisin 1 is primarily expressed in photoreceptor and bipolar cells, where it plays a significant role in retinal development and stability. The protein is characterized by its discoidin domain, which facilitates its function as a cell adhesion molecule, and it forms homo-octameric complexes that interact with various molecules on the plasma membrane, including the Na/K-ATPase complex and L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (Shi2017Retinoschisin; Molday2007Retinoschisin). These interactions are essential for maintaining cellular ion homeostasis and the electrophysiological integrity of the retina. Mutations in the RS1 gene are linked to X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS), a genetic disorder that leads to vision loss due to the splitting of the retinal layers, highlighting the gene's clinical significance (Huopaniemi2000Characterization; Vijayasarathy2022Of).

## Structure
The RS1 (retinoschisin 1) protein is characterized by its unique molecular structure, which plays a crucial role in retinal cell adhesion. RS1 is composed of a discoidin domain and a small N-terminal RS1 domain. The discoidin domain is a key structural unit, featuring a core β-barrel structure with a 5-strand antiparallel β-sheet packing against a 3-strand antiparallel β-sheet, stabilized by disulfide bonds between conserved cysteine residues (Molday2007Retinoschisin). 

RS1 forms a homo-oligomeric complex, typically assembling into paired octameric rings. These rings are stabilized by disulfide bonds, such as C59-C223, C63-C219, and C110-C142, which are crucial for maintaining the octameric structure (Tolun2016Paired). The protein's quaternary structure involves back-to-back double rings, forming a 16-mer in a dihedral eightfold arrangement (Tolun2016Paired). 

The RS1 protein is secreted as a soluble disulfide bond-stabilized octamer, with the discoidin domain comprising most of the monomer (Tolun2016Paired). The RS1 domain, although not essential for ring formation, is located at the centers of the rings and may interact with membranes or other proteins (Tolun2016Paired). The protein's structure includes loops, referred to as 'spikes,' which are associated with ligand binding and may interact with membranes or other proteins (Tolun2016Paired).

## Function
Retinoschisin, encoded by the RS1 gene, is an extracellular adhesive protein crucial for maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the retina. It is primarily expressed in photoreceptor and bipolar cells, where it plays a significant role in retinal development and stability. Retinoschisin forms homo-octamers and interacts with various molecules on the plasma membrane, including the Na/K-ATPase complex and L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (LTCCs) such as Cav1.3 and Cav1.4 (Shi2017Retinoschisin; Schmid2022Retinoschisin).

In healthy human cells, retinoschisin is anchored to the retinal plasma membrane through its interaction with the Na/K-ATPase, which is essential for maintaining cellular ion homeostasis and forming specific plasma membrane microdomains (Schmid2022Retinoschisin). This interaction is crucial for the proper localization and function of the Na/K-ATPase and associated proteins, contributing to the electrophysiological integrity of the retina (Schmid2022Retinoschisin).

Retinoschisin also enhances the conductance and voltage-dependent activation of LTCCs, facilitating their plasma membrane insertion and retention, which is vital for modulating LTCC gating properties and maintaining retinal architecture (Shi2017Retinoschisin). These interactions are essential for cellular calcium homeostasis and neurotransmitter release, contributing to the overall function and stability of the retina (Shi2017Retinoschisin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RS1 gene, which encodes the retinoschisin protein, are primarily associated with X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS), a genetic condition that leads to vision loss due to the splitting of the retinal layers. This condition predominantly affects males due to its X-linked recessive inheritance pattern, while heterozygous females are generally asymptomatic carriers (Huopaniemi2000Characterization; Vijayasarathy2022Of). XLRS is characterized by reduced visual acuity from a young age, with clinical features including foveo-macular cystic schisis cavities and a spoke-wheel pattern of schisis in the retina (Guo2022Phenotype; Vijayasarathy2022Of).

The RS1 gene mutations lead to a loss of function of the retinoschisin protein, which is crucial for maintaining retinal cell architecture and synaptic connectivity. This results in impaired visual-signal transduction and progressive vision loss (Vijayasarathy2010Molecular; Vijayasarathy2022Of). Over 230 distinct mutations in the RS1 gene have been identified, contributing to the variability in clinical presentation and severity of XLRS (Sergeev2013Molecular; Chen2021Whole‑exome). These mutations often affect the discoidin domain of the protein, leading to misfolded, nonfunctional variants that disrupt retinal integrity (Vijayasarathy2010Molecular).

## Interactions
Retinoschisin (RS1) is a protein encoded by the RS1 gene, which plays a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity of the retina through its interactions with other proteins. RS1 is known to form a disulfide-linked homo-octameric complex that associates with the cell surface of retinal photoreceptors and bipolar cells. This complex is crucial for maintaining the cellular organization of the retina and the photoreceptor-bipolar synaptic structure (Molday2007Retinoschisin).

RS1 interacts with the Na/K ATPase complex, specifically the α3 and β2 isoforms, and SARM1, a cytoplasmic adaptor protein. These interactions suggest a novel signaling pathway important for retinal cell organization and synaptic structure (Molday2007Retinoschisin). The β2-subunit of Na/K ATPase, also known as AMOG, is involved in neural cell adhesion and is likely a key binding partner for RS1 (Molday2007Retinoschisin).

Retinoschisin promotes the oligomerization of Na/K ATPase, potentially inducing conformational changes that facilitate SARM1 binding on the cytoplasmic side. This complex is thought to stabilize interactions with the extracellular matrix and maintain the structure and function of photoreceptor-bipolar synapses (Molday2007Retinoschisin). Additionally, RS1 deficiency leads to mislocalization of the retinal Na/K ATPase and associated proteins, affecting retinal development and function (Schmid2022Retinoschisin).
