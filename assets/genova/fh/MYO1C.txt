# MYO1C

## Overview
MYO1C is a gene that encodes the unconventional myosin IC protein, a member of the myosin superfamily known for its role as a motor protein. Myosin IC is involved in various cellular processes, including intracellular transport, signal transduction, and cytoskeletal dynamics. It is characterized by a motor domain that interacts with actin filaments and hydrolyzes ATP, a neck region with IQ motifs that bind calmodulin, and a tail domain containing a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain for phosphoinositide binding (Lu2014Structure; Arif2016Structural). Myosin IC is crucial for processes such as endocytosis, exocytosis, and membrane trafficking, and it plays a significant role in maintaining cellular structures like the glomerular filtration barrier in podocytes and facilitating insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes (Greenberg2012Myosin; Bose2002Glucose). The protein's function is modulated by calcium levels and interactions with various regulatory proteins, highlighting its importance in cellular signaling and mechanochemical activities (Ji2020The; Lu2014Structure).

## Structure
MYO1C, a member of the unconventional myosin family, exhibits a complex molecular structure that includes distinct domains and motifs. The protein features a motor domain that binds actin and hydrolyzes ATP, essential for its role in intracellular transport and signal transduction (Arif2016Structural). The neck region of MYO1C contains three IQ motifs, which bind calmodulin, a calcium-binding messenger protein. These motifs form a continuous α-helix, with IQ1 and IQ2 interacting with calmodulin in a canonical manner, while IQ3 binds only to the C lobe of calmodulin (Lu2014Structure).

The tail domain of MYO1C includes a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which is involved in binding phosphoinositides and potentially interacting with adaptor proteins or GTPases (Lu2014Structure). This domain is characterized by a seven-stranded β-barrel and an α-helix, forming a canonical PH-domain fold (Lu2014Structure). The structure of MYO1C is further stabilized by interactions between the IQ motifs, the post-IQ domain, and the extended PH domain, resulting in a spatially rigid conformation (Lu2014Structure).

MYO1C undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which regulate its activity and interactions (Münnich2014Crystal). The protein also exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which affects its mechanochemical properties and function (Giese2021Mechanochemical).

## Function
MYO1C (myosin IC) is a motor protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes by linking the actin cytoskeleton to cell membranes. It is involved in the transport of proteins and vesicles, contributing to processes such as endocytosis, exocytosis, and membrane trafficking (Greenberg2012Myosin). MYO1C is active in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane, where it facilitates the insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane in adipocytes, enhancing glucose uptake (Bose2002Glucose).

In podocytes, MYO1C is crucial for the transport of slit diaphragm proteins like Neph1 and nephrin to the cell membrane, maintaining the structural integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier (Arif2011Motor). It also plays a role in the nuclear localization mechanism, interacting with phosphoinositides and chromatin, which is essential for gene expression regulation (Nevzorov2018Myosin‐1C).

MYO1C is involved in the exocytosis of surfactant-containing secretory granules in alveolar type II cells, influencing vesicle compression and actin coat formation (Kittelberger2016The). It also facilitates the transport of G-actin to the leading edge of migrating endothelial cells, crucial for cell motility (Fan2012Myo1c). The protein's function is regulated by intracellular calcium levels, affecting its interaction with calmodulin and its mechanochemical properties (Lu2014Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the MYO1C gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. In the context of kidney function, MYO1C plays a crucial role in podocytes, which are essential for maintaining the filtration barrier in the kidneys. Podocyte-specific deletion of MYO1C in mice has shown protective effects against glomerular injuries, such as those induced by nephrotoxic serum and Adriamycin, suggesting that MYO1C expression levels can influence susceptibility to kidney diseases characterized by podocyte injury and proteinuria (Arif2019The).

In the retina, MYO1C is critical for photoreceptor function, particularly in opsin trafficking. Loss of MYO1C leads to mislocalization of rhodopsin and progressive loss of photoreceptor function, which can result in retinal degeneration (Solanki2020Motor; Solanki2021Loss). MYO1C mutations affecting its nucleotide-binding pocket and calcium binding ability have also been associated with hearing loss, indicating its broader role in sensory functions (Solanki2020Motor).

In cancer, MYO1C acts as a tumor suppressor. Lowered expression of MYO1C is associated with advanced stages of endometrial carcinoma, where it stimulates cell proliferation and suppresses cell adhesion, potentially contributing to cancer progression through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (Visuttijai2016Lowered).

## Interactions
MYO1C interacts with various proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It binds to phosphoinositides and links the actin cytoskeleton to cellular membranes. MYO1C interacts with calcium-binding protein 1 (CaBP1) and calcium-and integrin-binding-protein-1 (CIB1), which bind to its regulatory domain. These interactions occur at the IQ motifs, where CaBP1 and CIB1 compete with calmodulin for binding, especially in the presence of calcium (Tang2007CIB1).

MYO1C also interacts with the podocyte protein Neph1, facilitating its transport to the podocyte cell membrane. This interaction is crucial for the organization of Neph1 and nephrin at the slit diaphragm, essential for podocyte function. MYO1C's role in this process is actin-dependent, and its knockdown results in defects in cell migration and tight junction formation (Arif2011Motor).

Additionally, MYO1C binds to the regulatory protein 14-3-3β, which displaces calmodulin from the motor's lever arm in the presence of calcium. This interaction does not affect MYO1C's ATPase activity or actin filament gliding, suggesting a role as an adaptor linking MYO1C to other proteins (Ji2020The).
