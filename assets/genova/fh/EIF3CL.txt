# EIF3CL

## Overview
The EIF3CL gene encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit C-like protein, which is a component of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex. This complex plays a crucial role in the initiation phase of eukaryotic translation, facilitating the assembly of the 40S ribosomal subunit with mRNA and the initiator tRNA. As a part of the eIF3 complex, the EIF3CL protein is involved in the regulation of protein synthesis, a fundamental cellular process. The protein is categorized as a translation initiation factor, which is essential for the proper translation of mRNA into proteins. Dysregulation of EIF3CL has been linked to various cancers, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
EIF3CL has been implicated in the development and progression of various cancers due to its role in protein synthesis. Alterations in the expression of EIF3CL can disrupt normal cellular processes, potentially leading to oncogenesis. Dysregulation of EIF3CL has been associated with breast cancer, where changes in its expression may contribute to tumor growth and metastasis. Similarly, in prostate cancer, EIF3CL expression alterations have been linked to disease progression, suggesting that it may play a role in the malignancy of prostate cells. These associations indicate that EIF3CL could be a potential biomarker for cancer diagnosis or prognosis, as well as a target for therapeutic interventions. The precise mechanisms by which EIF3CL contributes to these malignancies are still under investigation, but its involvement in the regulation of translation initiation is a critical factor in its impact on cancer development.
