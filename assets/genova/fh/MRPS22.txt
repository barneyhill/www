# MRPS22

## Overview
The MRPS22 gene encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S22, which is a vital component of the small 28S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by aiding the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into proteins essential for the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, excluding complex II (Chen2018Mutations). As a mitochondrial ribosomal protein, MRPS22 is integral to the assembly and stability of the mitochondrial ribosome, impacting cellular energy production and metabolism (Gopisetty2016Mammalian). Beyond its primary function in mitochondrial translation, MRPS22 is involved in various protein-protein interactions, suggesting additional roles in cellular signaling pathways, including those related to cellular stress responses (Revathi2021Expression). Mutations in the MRPS22 gene are linked to several mitochondrial disorders, underscoring its importance in maintaining mitochondrial function and overall cellular health (Smits2010Mutation).

## Function
MRPS22 is a mitochondrial ribosomal protein that is a component of the small 28S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. It plays a critical role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into functional proteins, which are essential for the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, except for complex II (Chen2018Mutations). This process is vital for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production, impacting cellular metabolism and overall organismal health (Gopisetty2016Mammalian).

In healthy human cells, MRPS22 is necessary for the assembly and stability of the mitochondrial ribosome's small subunit. It is crucial for the proper incorporation of other small subunit ribosomal proteins, such as MRPS11 and MRPS16, into sub-ribosomal particles (Emdadul2008The). The absence of functional MRPS22 leads to a significant reduction in the levels of 12S rRNA, indicating its essential role in ribosome assembly and mitochondrial protein synthesis (Emdadul2008The).

MRPS22 is also involved in maintaining the activity of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system, which is crucial for energy production in cells. Mutations in MRPS22 can lead to severe respiratory chain dysfunctions, highlighting its importance in mitochondrial function (Smits2010Mutation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MRPS22 gene are associated with a range of mitochondrial disorders, often resulting in severe clinical phenotypes. These mutations can lead to deficiencies in mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I, III, and IV, causing significant mitochondrial dysfunction. Patients with MRPS22 mutations may present with conditions such as Cornelia de Lange-like phenotype, brain abnormalities, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Gopisetty2016Mammalian; Smits2010Mutation). A specific mutation, R170H, has been linked to antenatal mitochondrial disease, characterized by edema, cardiomyopathy, and tubulopathy (Emdadul2008The; Saada2007Antenatal).

MRPS22 mutations have also been implicated in primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), a condition leading to infertility due to early ovarian failure. Variants such as p.R135Q and p.R202H are associated with POI, although they do not appear to affect mitochondrial function in fibroblasts, suggesting a tissue-specific impact (Chen2018Mutations). In some cases, MRPS22 mutations result in fatal neonatal lactic acidosis, accompanied by brain and heart abnormalities (Baertling2015MRPS22). These findings highlight the critical role of MRPS22 in mitochondrial function and its involvement in diverse clinical manifestations.

## Interactions
MRPS22 is involved in several protein-protein interactions that suggest its role extends beyond mitochondrial translation. It interacts with various mitochondrial ribosomal small subunit proteins, such as MRPS5, MRPS18B, MRPS27, MRPS28, and MRPS38, as well as with the p53 protein, a key regulator in cellular stress responses. These interactions indicate a potential involvement in p53-related pathways, which are crucial for cellular stress and tumorigenic processes (Revathi2021Expression).

MRPS22 is also implicated in the MAPK6/MAPK4 signaling pathways, suggesting a broader role in cellular signaling beyond its traditional function in the mitochondrial ribosome (Revathi2021Expression). The protein is essential for the assembly and stability of the mitochondrial ribosome, and mutations in MRPS22 can lead to significant reductions in 12S rRNA levels, affecting the assembly of the small ribosomal subunit (Emdadul2008The).

Additionally, MRPS22's interactions are affected by the MPV17L2 gene, which is required for mitochondrial ribosome assembly. Silencing MPV17L2 leads to a reduction in MRPS22 levels, indicating that MRPS22's stability and function are linked to the broader mitochondrial ribosomal assembly process (Dalla2014MPV17L2).
