# GSTZ1

## Overview
GSTZ1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme glutathione S-transferase zeta 1, which belongs to the Zeta class of glutathione transferases. This enzyme is primarily involved in the detoxification processes within the body, playing a crucial role in the metabolism of dichloroacetate (DCA) and the catabolism of tyrosine. GSTZ1 catalyzes the conversion of DCA to glyoxylate and facilitates the isomerization of maleylacetoacetate to fumarylacetoacetate in the tyrosine degradation pathway, thus preventing the accumulation of potentially toxic intermediates (James2017Therapeutic; Board2011Glutathione). The protein is expressed in various tissues, with the highest levels found in the liver, and is present in both the cytosol and mitochondria, where it exhibits distinct kinetic properties (Zhong2018AgeRelated). Genetic variations in GSTZ1 can influence its enzymatic activity and expression, impacting drug metabolism and susceptibility to certain diseases (Langaee2015The).

## Structure
The human GSTZ1 protein is a member of the Zeta class of glutathione transferases, characterized by a conserved N-terminal domain and a more variable C-terminal domain. The primary structure of GSTZ1 includes a peptide of 216 residues with a predicted molecular mass of 24,166 Da (BOARD1997Zeta). The secondary structure features a generally similar fold to other GST classes, with significant differences around the α-2 helix, resulting in a small, almost buried, polar active site (SHEEHAN2001Structure). 

The tertiary structure of GSTZ1 reveals a unique dimer interface dominated by hydrophobic interactions between small aliphatic residues, with a methionine residue acting as a key in a 'lock and key' motif, which is distinct from other GST classes (SHEEHAN2001Structure). The quaternary structure of GSTZ1 is a homodimer, with each subunit having a molecular weight of approximately 24.2 kDa, forming a dimer of about 48 kDa (BOARD1997Zeta).

The active site of GSTZ1 includes a highly conserved motif with serine residues, particularly Ser-14, which is essential for catalysis (Board2013Glutathione). The enzyme is involved in the isomerization of maleylacetoacetate to fumarylacetoacetate in the tyrosine degradation pathway (Board2011Glutathione).

## Function
Glutathione S-transferase zeta 1 (GSTZ1) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the metabolism of dichloroacetate (DCA) and the catabolism of tyrosine in healthy human cells. GSTZ1 catalyzes the conversion of DCA to glyoxylate through a glutathione-dependent mechanism, although glutathione is not consumed in the process (James2017Therapeutic; Board2011Glutathione). This conversion is part of the detoxification process, as glyoxylate is further metabolized into secondary metabolites such as glycine, carbon dioxide, and oxalate (James2017Therapeutic).

In the tyrosine catabolism pathway, GSTZ1 functions as maleylacetoacetate isomerase, catalyzing the isomerization of maleylacetoacetate to fumarylacetoacetate, which is a crucial step in reducing the potential toxicity of reactive intermediates (James2017Therapeutic; Blackburn2005Deficiency). This enzyme is expressed in various tissues, with the highest expression in the liver, and is found in both the cytosol and mitochondria, exhibiting different kinetic properties in each location (James2017Therapeutic; Zhong2018AgeRelated).

GSTZ1's activity is influenced by genetic variations, which can affect its expression levels and enzymatic activity, impacting the metabolism of DCA and potentially leading to differences in drug response and toxicity (Langaee2015The; Zhong2018AgeRelated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GSTZ1 gene have been linked to various clinical conditions. GSTZ1 is involved in the metabolism of dichloroacetate (DCA), a compound used in cancer therapy. Variations in GSTZ1 expression can influence resistance to DCA treatment, with low expression levels correlating with poor survival in breast cancer patients (James2017Therapeutic). Additionally, GSTZ1 polymorphisms have been studied for their association with cancer risk. While no significant correlation was found with breast or gastric cancer, a potential link with bladder cancer was noted, particularly in relation to exposure to disinfectant byproducts (James2017Therapeutic).

GSTZ1 is also implicated in metabolic disorders. Its inactivation can lead to the accumulation of toxic intermediates in the tyrosine catabolism pathway, resembling symptoms of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HTT1), a condition characterized by liver and nervous system damage (James2017Therapeutic). In knockout mice, the absence of GSTZ1 results in symptoms such as enlarged livers and kidneys, oxidative stress, and increased susceptibility to acetaminophen toxicity (Fang2006Polymorphisms).

Furthermore, genetic variants in GSTZ1 have been associated with human longevity, suggesting a role in managing environmental and internal stresses related to aging (Di2012MAP3K7).
