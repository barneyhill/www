# SGPP1

## Overview
The SGPP1 gene encodes the enzyme sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatase 1, which is a critical component in the metabolic pathway of sphingolipids. This enzyme is categorized as a phosphatase and is primarily involved in the dephosphorylation of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) to sphingosine, a process that occurs predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum. The regulation of S1P levels by SGPP1 is essential for various cellular functions, including cell movement, differentiation, and survival, as well as broader physiological processes such as inflammation, immunity, and angiogenesis (GAO2015Inhibition; Barnawi2015Potential). Alterations in SGPP1 expression have been implicated in several cancers, where its expression levels can influence tumor progression and patient prognosis, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker (Petrusca2022GFI1Dependent; GAO2015Inhibition).

## Function
SGPP1 (sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatase 1) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the metabolism of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive lipid involved in numerous cellular processes. SGPP1 is responsible for the dephosphorylation of S1P to sphingosine, a reaction that is crucial for regulating S1P levels within cells. This enzymatic activity is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, where SGPP1 helps maintain cellular homeostasis by modulating the balance between S1P and sphingosine (Barnawi2015Potential).

In healthy human cells, SGPP1's regulation of S1P levels influences various biological processes, including cell movement, differentiation, survival, inflammation, immunity, calcium homeostasis, and angiogenesis (GAO2015Inhibition). By converting S1P to sphingosine, SGPP1 can lead to S1P inactivation, which may result in apoptosis and cell degeneration, thereby playing a role in controlling cell proliferation and survival (GAO2015Inhibition). This function is essential for maintaining vascular integrity and proper immune responses, as S1P is a key signaling molecule in these processes (Barnawi2015Potential). The enzyme's activity is crucial for the proper functioning of various cellular and organismal systems, highlighting its importance in maintaining physiological balance.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SGPP1 gene have significant clinical implications in various cancers. In gastric cancer, decreased expression of SGPP1 is associated with increased cell invasion and migration, suggesting that its downregulation may promote cancer metastasis. Clinically, higher SGPP1 expression levels correlate with longer overall survival and progression-free survival in gastric cancer patients, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker (GAO2015Inhibition).

In multiple myeloma, SGPP1 expression is progressively repressed compared to normal plasma cells, with more profound inhibition observed in relapsed patients. This repression is linked to increased levels of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), which affects the stability of the oncoprotein c-Myc, promoting cell survival and drug resistance. High SGPP1 levels are associated with longer survival in multiple myeloma patients, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Petrusca2022GFI1Dependent).

In breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer, lower expression levels of SGPP1 are associated with worse relapse-free and overall survival. SGPP1 expression is linked to better survival outcomes in systemically treated breast cancer patients, suggesting its role as a prognostic marker (Nema2021Sphingosine1Phosphate).
