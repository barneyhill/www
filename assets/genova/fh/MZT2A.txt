# MZT2A

## Overview
MZT2A, or mitotic spindle organizing protein 2A, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC), which is essential for microtubule nucleation in eukaryotic cells. The protein product of MZT2A is categorized as a microtubule-associated protein and is primarily localized at the centrosome, where it plays a critical role in the regulation of microtubule dynamics, including polymerization and depolymerization. This regulation is vital for proper mitotic spindle formation and chromosome segregation during cell division, thereby maintaining genomic stability (Wang2020Mitotic; Wang2021MZT2A). MZT2A's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in cellular function and its potential implications in oncogenesis, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where its dysregulation has been linked to tumor progression and poor prognosis (Dráber2021Dysregulation; Wang2021MZT2A).

## Function
MZT2A, also known as mitotic spindle organizing protein 2A, is a crucial component of the γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC), which plays a significant role in microtubule nucleation within cells. This protein is localized at the centrosome, a key microtubule organizing center, where it contributes to the regulation of microtubule polymerization and depolymerization, essential processes for maintaining cellular structure and function (Wang2020Mitotic; Wang2021MZT2A). 

MZT2A is involved in the structural stability and assembly of the γ-TuRC, which is necessary for microtubule nucleation, a process critical for cell division and intracellular transport (Zupa2021The). The γ-TuRC typically exists in an open conformation, and MZT2A, in conjunction with other proteins like CDK5RAP2, helps stabilize the closed conformation of the complex, enhancing its microtubule-nucleating activity (Xu2023Closure). 

In healthy cells, MZT2A's role in microtubule nucleation is vital for proper mitotic spindle formation, ensuring accurate chromosome segregation during cell division. This function is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and preventing aneuploidy, which can lead to various diseases, including cancer (Wang2020Mitotic).

## Clinical Significance
MZT2A has been implicated in the progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Studies have shown that MZT2A expression is significantly higher in NSCLC tissues compared to normal lung tissues, and this elevated expression is associated with poor prognosis, larger tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and advanced TNM stages in patients (Dráber2021Dysregulation; Wang2021MZT2A). Overexpression of MZT2A promotes NSCLC cell viability and invasion, while its knockdown has the opposite effect (Wang2021MZT2A). 

At the molecular level, MZT2A influences the Akt signaling pathway, which is crucial for cancer cell survival and proliferation. MZT2A overexpression leads to increased Akt phosphorylation, enhancing NSCLC cell proliferation and invasion. This effect can be mitigated by using an Akt inhibitor, suggesting that MZT2A's role in cancer progression is mediated through Akt signaling (Wang2021MZT2A). 

Additionally, MZT2A interacts with LGALS3BP, and this interaction is necessary for its effects on Akt phosphorylation and cancer cell behavior. The knockdown of LGALS3BP reduces the oncogenic effects of MZT2A, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in NSCLC (Wang2021MZT2A).

## Interactions
MZT2A, or mitotic spindle organizing protein 2A, is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) progression. One of its key interactions is with galectin-3-binding protein (LGALS3BP). This interaction is crucial for the upregulation of LGALS3BP, which in turn is linked to the activation of Akt signaling pathways. The interaction between MZT2A and LGALS3BP was confirmed using co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis in NSCLC cell lines such as A549 and H1299 (Wang2020Mitotic; Wang2021MZT2A).

MZT2A also influences Akt phosphorylation, a process essential for NSCLC cell viability and invasion. This effect is mediated through the MOZART2 domain of MZT2A, which is necessary for its ability to bind and regulate LGALS3BP expression and Akt phosphorylation (Wang2020Mitotic; Wang2021MZT2A). The interaction with LGALS3BP is proposed to act as a bridge, facilitating the indirect activation of Akt by MZT2A (Wang2020Mitotic).

These interactions highlight MZT2A's role in promoting oncogenic activities in NSCLC, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Wang2021MZT2A).
