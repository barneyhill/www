# TMEM42

## Overview
TMEM42 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 42, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, primarily through its interactions with other proteins, such as the orphan G protein-coupled receptor GPR152, suggesting a role in GPCR-mediated regulatory mechanisms (Zhang2024Computing). TMEM42 has been implicated in several clinical contexts, including major depression and colorectal cancer, where its expression levels and epigenetic modifications may serve as potential biomarkers or contribute to disease pathophysiology (Scarr2019Changed; Mori2011Novel). Additionally, TMEM42 is associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, indicating its potential involvement in complex genetic networks affecting brain function (Meganathan2021Altered). Despite these associations, the precise biological functions and mechanisms of TMEM42 remain an active area of research.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
TMEM42, a transmembrane protein, has been implicated in several clinical contexts due to alterations in its expression levels. In major depression (MD), TMEM42 expression is notably reduced in Brodmann area 9 (BA 9) of the cortex, which may contribute to the unique cortical dysfunctions observed in this disorder. This altered expression is associated with pathways involved in bupropion degradation and estrogen biosynthesis, potentially affecting cell signaling and lipid metabolism, which could influence cognitive and emotional dysfunctions in MD (Scarr2019Changed). 

In the context of colorectal cancers (CRCs), TMEM42 has been identified as a locus with neoplasia-specific hypermethylation. Although infrequent, this hypermethylation could serve as a biomarker for distinguishing CRCs from non-cancerous colonic tissues (Mori2011Novel). 

Additionally, TMEM42 has been highlighted in studies involving neurodevelopmental disorders. It intersects with genes having genome-wide significance for such disorders, suggesting a potential role in the clinical phenotypes observed in models with chromosome 15 duplications involving the CHRNA7 gene (Meganathan2021Altered). However, the specific diseases or conditions directly associated with TMEM42 gene mutations remain under investigation.

## Interactions
TMEM42, a transmembrane protein, has been identified to interact with the orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), GPR152. This interaction is notable as it suggests a potential regulatory role of GPCRs in transporter activity, given TMEM42's homology to various transporters. The interaction between TMEM42 and GPR152 was highlighted in a study focused on identifying novel protein-protein interactions (PPIs) that are not present in existing databases and lack homologous templates. This study aims to provide insights into protein functions and their implications in human diseases (Zhang2024Computing).

While TMEM42 is mentioned in the context of gene expression studies related to Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC), specific interactions of TMEM42 in these diseases are not detailed. The gene is listed among those that are upregulated or downregulated in these conditions, but the excerpt does not provide further information on its protein interactions or functional roles in T2DM or HCC (Liu2019Key). 

Overall, the interaction between TMEM42 and GPR152 represents a significant finding in the study of transmembrane protein interactions, particularly in the context of GPCR-mediated regulatory mechanisms.
