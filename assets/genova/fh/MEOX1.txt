# MEOX1

## Overview
MEOX1, or mesenchyme homeobox 1, is a gene that encodes a homeodomain transcription factor involved in the regulation of mesodermal cell differentiation and development. The protein product, mesenchyme homeobox 1, functions primarily within the nucleus, where it binds to DNA to modulate gene expression, thereby influencing cell fate and tissue patterning. As a transcription factor, MEOX1 plays a pivotal role in various biological processes, including the regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and the maintenance of sclerotome polarity during embryonic development. It is also implicated in the pathogenesis of certain congenital disorders and cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Bayrakli2013Mutation; Skuntz2009Lack; Douville2011Mechanisms).

## Function
MEOX1 is a homeobox transcription factor that plays a critical role in the regulation of mesodermal cell differentiation and development. It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA to regulate gene expression, influencing cell fate and tissue patterning. MEOX1 is involved in the regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21^CIP1/WAF1 and p16^INK4a, which are crucial for the G1/S cell cycle checkpoint. These inhibitors block cellular proliferation by preventing the activation of cyclin-dependent kinases, thereby halting cell cycle progression (Douville2011Mechanisms).

In vascular endothelial cells, MEOX1 activates the transcription of p21^CIP1/WAF1 and p16^INK4a, leading to cell cycle arrest and senescence. The activation of p16^INK4a by MEOX1 requires DNA binding, while the induction of p21^CIP1/WAF1 occurs in a DNA binding-independent manner (Douville2011Mechanisms). MEOX1 also plays a significant role in maintaining sclerotome polarity and the formation of cranio-cervical joints during embryonic development. It regulates the expression of genes such as Tbx18 and Uncx, which are important for sclerotome patterning and somitic cell proliferation (Skuntz2009Lack).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MEOX1 gene are associated with Klippel-Feil syndrome (KFS), a condition characterized by the congenital fusion of cervical vertebrae, leading to a short neck, low posterior hairline, and limited neck movement. Specifically, a recessive subtype of KFS, known as KFS2, has been linked to a homozygous nonsense mutation in the MEOX1 gene, resulting in a truncated protein and nonsense-mediated decay of the mRNA. This mutation was identified in a Turkish family and is associated with vertebral defects primarily in the cervical region, similar to those observed in MEOX1 mutant mice (Bayrakli2013Mutation).

Alterations in MEOX1 expression have also been implicated in cancer, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) with deficiencies in P53 and PTEN. In these cases, MEOX1 expression is upregulated, contributing to increased cell proliferation, self-renewal, and metastatic potential. Knockdown of MEOX1 in TNBC cells results in decreased tumor growth and reduced activity of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, suggesting that MEOX1 is crucial for the aggressive behavior of these cancer cells (Gasparyan2020Combined).

## Interactions
MEOX1, a homeodomain transcription factor, is known to interact with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in gene regulation. It forms heterodimeric transcription complexes with PBX1, another homeodomain protein, in cancer cells. This interaction has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293 cells, indicating a physical interaction between MEOX1 and PBX1. MEOX1 is involved in the transcription of several PBX1-regulated genes, suggesting that it acts as a critical mediator of PBX1-related growth signals in ovarian cancer cells (Thiaville2012Identification).

In vascular endothelial cells, MEOX1 regulates the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors such as p16 INK4a. It binds to the proximal homeodomain binding site on the p16 INK4a promoter, a process essential for its transcriptional activation. This binding has been demonstrated using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), which show that MEOX1, along with MEOX2, binds specifically to this site (Douville2011Mechanisms).

MEOX1 also interacts with the RhoA-CDC42-CXCR4 signaling pathway, influencing the migration of Sca-1-positive stem cells into the neointima, which is crucial for vascular repair processes (Wu2021Spatiotemporal).
