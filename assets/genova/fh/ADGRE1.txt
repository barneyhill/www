# ADGRE1

## Overview
ADGRE1, also known as EMR1, is a gene that encodes the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor E1, a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This receptor is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain and an extensive extracellular region with multiple EGF-like calcium-binding domains, which are crucial for its role in cell adhesion and signaling. The ADGRE1 protein is predominantly expressed in myeloid cells, such as eosinophils and macrophages, and is involved in regulating immune cell function and differentiation. It plays a significant role in immune response regulation, particularly in the differentiation of monocytes into macrophages and in respiratory immune defense. The gene's expression is inducible by inflammatory stimuli, and its dysregulation is associated with various diseases, including inflammatory conditions and cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Akter2022EMR1ADGRE1; Waddell2018ADGRE1).

## Structure
The ADGRE1 protein, also known as EMR1, is a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. It is characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain typical of GPCRs and an extensive extracellular region containing multiple EGF-like calcium-binding domains. In humans, the ADGRE1 protein is predicted to be 940 amino acids long, with an extracellular domain that includes seven EGF-like domains. This structure is based on cross-species alignment with mouse and pig cDNA, which identified an additional exon encoding a seventh EGF-like domain in the human genome (Waddell2018ADGRE1).

The protein structure of ADGRE1 varies between species, with humans, rodents, and pigs having a similar structure of seven EGF-like domains. In contrast, ruminants, horses, cats, and dogs likely encode 14 EGF-like domains due to a duplication of the seven-domain structure (Waddell2018ADGRE1). The ADGRE1 gene is subject to alternative splicing, which can result in multiple isoforms with varying numbers of EGF-like domains, contributing to its functional diversity (Waddell2018ADGRE1). The protein may also undergo regulated glycosylation, which could further influence its function and interactions (Waddell2018ADGRE1).

## Function
ADGRE1, also known as EMR1, is a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family and plays a significant role in the immune system. In healthy human cells, ADGRE1 is primarily expressed in myeloid cells, including eosinophils and macrophages, where it serves as a marker for these cell types (Akter2022EMR1ADGRE1). The protein is involved in regulating immune cell function, particularly during the differentiation of monocytes into macrophages from progenitors in the bone marrow (Akter2022EMR1ADGRE1).

ADGRE1 is part of the epidermal growth factor-seven-transmembrane (EGF-TM7) subfamily of GPCRs, which are characterized by their role in cell adhesion, migration, and signaling processes (Waddell2018ADGRE1). These processes are crucial for maintaining tissue homeostasis and controlling inflammation. The gene's expression is inducible by stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in monocyte-derived macrophages, with the highest expression observed in LPS-stimulated cells, indicating its role in immune response regulation (Waddell2018ADGRE1).

ADGRE1 is also involved in the differentiation of CD16++ monocytes and is highly expressed in tissue macrophages, particularly in the lung, suggesting its importance in respiratory immune defense (Waddell2018ADGRE1). The gene's expression pattern and regulatory mechanisms highlight its role in genetic susceptibility to inflammatory conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease (Waddell2018ADGRE1).

## Clinical Significance
The ADGRE1 gene, also known as EMR1, is associated with various diseases due to its role in immune function. Alterations in its expression have been linked to several conditions. In the context of kidney diseases, increased expression of ADGRE1 is observed in conditions such as diabetic nephropathy and lupus nephritis, suggesting a role in the pathophysiology of these diseases (CazorlaVázquez2018Adasséssion). 

In the context of cancer, particularly acute myeloid leukemia (AML), ADGRE1 is noted for its involvement in disease progression. High expression levels of ADGRE1 are associated with poor prognosis and survival outcomes in AML patients. This is linked to its role in cell signaling pathways that influence cell proliferation and survival, contributing to the aggressive nature of the disease (Yang2018Characterization). 

In addition to its role in cancer, ADGRE1 is also implicated in immune system function, where it is involved in the regulation of immune responses. This is particularly relevant in conditions characterized by inflammation, where altered expression of ADGRE1 can influence disease progression and severity (CazorlaVázquez2018Adasséssion). These associations highlight the potential of ADGRE1 as a therapeutic target in various diseases.

## Interactions
The ADGRE1 gene, also known as EMR1, encodes a protein that is involved in various interactions within the cellular environment. In the context of colon cancer, EMR1 has been shown to physically interact with the JAK2 protein. This interaction is particularly significant in cancer cells cocultured with macrophages, where EMR1 expression is upregulated, leading to enhanced binding with JAK2. This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, which demonstrated that the presence of macrophages facilitates the binding of EMR1 to JAK2, thereby activating the JAK2/STAT1,3 signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial for promoting cancer cell proliferation, migration, and reducing apoptosis (Akter2024Upregulation).

The study also explored the effects of inhibiting the JAK2/STAT3 pathway, which resulted in decreased expression of EMR1, JAK2, STAT1, and STAT3 mRNA, and subsequently reduced cancer cell proliferation and migration while increasing apoptosis. These findings underscore the role of EMR1 in modulating key signaling pathways through its interaction with JAK2, highlighting its potential impact on cancer progression and therapeutic response (Akter2024Upregulation).
