# DPH2

## Overview
The DPH2 gene encodes the diphthamide biosynthesis 2 protein, which plays a critical role in the post-translational modification of eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2 (eEF2) through the synthesis of diphthamide. This modification is essential for maintaining the fidelity of protein synthesis by preventing translational errors. DPH2 functions as part of a heterodimeric enzyme complex with DPH1, catalyzing the initial step of diphthamide biosynthesis, which involves the modification of histidine residues on eEF2. The presence of diphthamide is also crucial for cellular susceptibility to certain bacterial toxins, such as diphtheria toxin. Mutations in the DPH2 gene can lead to diphthamide-deficiency syndrome, a developmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability and other clinical features, underscoring the gene's importance in normal cellular function (Hawer2020Diphthamide-deficiency).

## Function
The DPH2 gene is integral to the biosynthesis of diphthamide, a unique post-translational modification of the eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2 (eEF2). This modification is crucial for maintaining the accuracy of protein synthesis by preventing reading frame errors during mRNA translation. Diphthamide acts as a molecular pawl, linking mRNA and rRNA in the ribosome's decoding center, thereby ensuring the fidelity of ribosomal protein biosynthesis (Hawer2020Diphthamide-deficiency).

In healthy human cells, DPH2, in conjunction with DPH1, forms a heterodimeric enzyme complex that catalyzes the initial step of diphthamide biosynthesis. This process involves the modification of histidine residues on eEF2, which is essential for the proper function of eEF2 in protein synthesis (Hawer2020Diphthamide-deficiency). The presence of diphthamide on eEF2 is also crucial for the cell's susceptibility to certain bacterial toxins, such as diphtheria toxin, which inactivates eEF2 by ADP-ribosylation at the diphthamide residue (Hawer2020Diphthamide-deficiency).

Mutations in the DPH2 gene can lead to a deficiency in diphthamide, resulting in developmental disorders characterized by intellectual disability and other clinical features, highlighting the gene's importance in normal cellular and organismal function (Hawer2020Diphthamide-deficiency).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DPH2 gene are associated with diphthamide-deficiency syndrome, a novel human developmental disorder and ribosomopathy. This condition is characterized by intellectual disability, macrocephaly, short stature, cardiac defects, and other dysmorphic features. The syndrome results from biallelic loss-of-function mutations in DPH2, which lead to significantly reduced enzyme functionality and impaired diphthamide biosynthesis on eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) (Hawer2020Diphthamide-deficiency). Specific variants such as c.922C > T (p.(Gln308*)) and c.601C > T (p.(Arg201Cys)) have been identified as causing a loss of function in DPH2, contributing to the clinical phenotype observed in affected individuals (Hawer2020Diphthamide-deficiency).

The diphthamide modification on eEF2 is crucial for accurate protein synthesis, and its absence can lead to developmental disorders due to impaired ribosomal function. The phenotypic overlap between DPH2-related disorders and those caused by mutations in the DPH1 gene suggests a common failure to modify eEF2 with diphthamide, leading to similar clinical manifestations (Hawer2020Diphthamide-deficiency). Additionally, yeast models have demonstrated that mutations in DPH2 result in resistance to diphtheria toxin, indicating the importance of diphthamide in cellular processes (Ütkür2024Functional).

## Interactions
DPH2 is involved in the biosynthesis of diphthamide, a modification of the eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2). It forms a crucial part of a multiprotein complex with DPH1 and DPH3, which is essential for the initial step of diphthamide synthesis. This step involves the transfer of 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl from S-adenosylmethionine to histidine on eEF2 (Webb2008Diphthamide). DPH2 and DPH1 form a heterodimer, which is necessary for their detection under native conditions, indicating a physiological relevance for diphthamide synthesis (Abdel-Fattah2013Insights). The Dph1-Dph2-Dph3 complex is important for the enzymatic activity required in this biosynthetic pathway, although the mere assembly of this complex does not guarantee enzymatic competence (Abdel-Fattah2013Insights).

The Dph1•Dph2 enzyme complex is a radical SAM enzyme that contains iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster cofactors crucial for its function and stability. Mutations in the cysteine residues of DPH2, which are part of the Fe-S cluster binding sites, can lead to a significant reduction in enzyme activity, highlighting the importance of these residues for the enzyme's function in diphthamide synthesis (Ütkür2024Functional).
