# SERTM1

## Overview
SERTM1 is a gene that encodes the protein serine rich and transmembrane domain containing 1. This protein is characterized by its serine-rich regions and the presence of transmembrane domains, suggesting its role as a transmembrane protein. Transmembrane proteins are integral components of cellular membranes and are involved in various cellular processes, including signaling and transport. The specific functions and interactions of the serine rich and transmembrane domain containing 1 protein remain to be fully elucidated, but its structural features imply potential involvement in cellular communication and molecular transport across membranes. Further research is necessary to understand the precise biological roles and clinical significance of SERTM1 and its encoded protein.
