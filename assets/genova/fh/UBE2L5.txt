# UBE2L5

## Overview
UBE2L5 is a gene that encodes the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 L5, a crucial component of the ubiquitination pathway, which is responsible for tagging proteins for degradation or functional modification. This enzyme is categorized as a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating protein turnover and modulating various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and DNA repair. UBE2L5 is particularly important in the context of antiviral defense, as it is involved in the post-translational modification of key signaling factors such as RIG-I, STING, and MAVS, which are essential for the interferon response (Mösbauer2021Allicin). The enzyme's activity is influenced by interactions with E3 ubiquitin ligases and ubiquitin-specific proteases, and it has been identified as having a persulfidation site that may affect its function (Fu2020Direct). UBE2L5's role in cellular processes and its differential expression in conditions such as melanoma highlight its potential clinical significance (Labbadia2023Distinct).

## Function
UBE2L5 encodes the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 L5, which plays a critical role in the ubiquitination process, a post-translational modification that tags proteins for degradation via the proteasome. This process is essential for regulating protein turnover and maintaining cellular homeostasis. UBE2L5 is involved in the post-translational modification of host signaling factors, such as RIG-I, STING, and MAVS, which are crucial for regulating the interferon (IFN) response, a key component of the antiviral defense mechanism (Mösbauer2021Allicin).

The enzyme is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and DNA repair. By modulating the ubiquitination of specific proteins, UBE2L5 helps control their stability and activity, thereby impacting cellular signaling pathways and responses to stress and damage. In the context of viral infections, UBE2L5 and other ubiquitin-related enzymes are involved in the degradation or activation of factors that influence the production of IFN and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which are vital for the antiviral response (Mösbauer2021Allicin). This highlights the enzyme's role in modulating immune responses and maintaining cellular integrity.

## Clinical Significance
UBE2L5 has been implicated in the progression of melanoma, a type of skin cancer. Studies have shown that UBE2L5 is differentially expressed in primary and metastatic cutaneous melanoma samples, suggesting its potential role in the altered proteostasis network associated with melanoma progression (Labbadia2023Distinct). The differential expression of UBE2L5, along with other proteostasis network genes, may influence melanoma prognosis, although specific clinical significance or detailed analysis of UBE2L5 mutations or interactions has not been provided (Labbadia2023Distinct).

Additionally, UBE2L5 is involved in protein ubiquitination, a process that tags proteins for degradation. Persulfidation, a post-translational modification, has been identified at active sites of UBE2L5, which may modulate its enzymatic activity. This suggests a regulatory role in biological processes, potentially impacting protein ubiquitination and sumoylation (Fu2020Direct). These modifications could have implications for understanding the biological roles of UBE2L5 in various conditions, although specific diseases directly resulting from these alterations have not been detailed in the available context (Fu2020Direct).

## Interactions
UBE2L5, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, is involved in the ubiquitination process, which is crucial for protein degradation and regulation of various cellular processes. It interacts with E3 ubiquitin ligases to transfer ubiquitin to target proteins, facilitating their degradation or activation. UBE2L5 is significantly induced in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, where it plays a role in the post-translational modification of host signaling factors such as RIG-I, STING, and MAVS. These interactions are important for regulating the interferon (IFN) response, a key component of the antiviral defense mechanism (Mösbauer2021Allicin; Mösbauer2021The).

The enzyme is also involved in the ubiquitination process that can lead to the degradation or activation of proteins involved in the antiviral response. This process is regulated by a network of protein interactions, including those with E3 ubiquitin ligases and ubiquitin-specific proteases (Mösbauer2021Allicin). Additionally, UBE2L5 has been identified as having a persulfidation site at C86, which may influence its enzymatic activity and modulate protein ubiquitination and sumoylation processes (Fu2020Direct). These interactions highlight UBE2L5's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to viral infections.
