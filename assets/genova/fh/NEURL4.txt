# NEURL4

## Overview
NEURL4 is a gene that encodes the protein neuralized E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 4, which is a member of the Neuralized family characterized by the presence of Neuralized Homology Repeat (NHR) domains. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of centrosome architecture and function, playing a crucial role in processes such as centrosome duplication and ciliogenesis. NEURL4 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, facilitating the ubiquitylation and degradation of proteins like CP110, which is essential for maintaining centriolar homeostasis and promoting cilia formation (Loukil2017The; Li2012Neurl4). Additionally, NEURL4 acts as a mitochondrial ADP-ribosyltransferase, contributing to mitochondrial DNA integrity and repair through the ADP-ribosylation of mitochondrial proteins (Cardamone2020ADPribosylation). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as HERC2 and CEP97, underscore its multifaceted role in cellular processes, including its potential implications in clinical conditions like male infertility and cancer (AlHakim2012Interaction; Hodžić2020De).

## Structure
NEURL4, a member of the Neuralized family, is characterized by the presence of Neuralized Homology Repeat (NHR) domains, which are highly conserved and facilitate protein-protein interactions (Cardamone2020ADPribosylation; Liu2017The). In mammals, NEURL4 contains a tandem of six NHR domains, which adopt a β-sandwich fold consisting of antiparallel β-sheets connected by loops (Liu2017The). The NHR domains are similar to B30.2/SPRY domains and are crucial for mediating protein interactions (Liu2017The).

NEURL4 also contains a putative H-Y-E[D-Q] ADP-ribosyltransferase domain (ART) in its C-terminal region, which is involved in ADP-ribosylation of mitochondrial proteins (Cardamone2020ADPribosylation). This domain is responsible for the enzymatic activity of NEURL4, contributing to mitochondrial DNA integrity and repair (Cardamone2020ADPribosylation).

The protein is predominantly localized in the mitochondrial matrix, facilitated by a mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) within the first 65 amino acids (Cardamone2020ADPribosylation). NEURL4's activity is regulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and it may exist in different isoforms due to splice variants (Cardamone2020ADPribosylation).

## Function
NEURL4 is a protein that plays a critical role in maintaining centrosome architecture and function in healthy human cells. It is involved in the regulation of CP110, a protein that caps the distal ends of centrioles and is crucial for centrosome duplication. NEURL4 promotes the ubiquitylation and degradation of CP110, thereby preventing the formation of ectopic microtubule organizing centers and maintaining centriolar homeostasis (Li2012Neurl4). NEURL4 is specifically associated with daughter centrioles and is essential for proper cell division and function (Li2012Neurl4).

NEURL4 also plays a significant role in ciliogenesis, the process of cilia formation. It transiently translocates from the daughter centriole to the mother centriole during early stages of ciliogenesis, facilitating the removal of CP110, which is necessary for cilia formation (Loukil2017The). This translocation is crucial for the regulation of CP110 levels at the mother centriole, promoting ciliogenesis (Loukil2017The).

In addition to its role in centrosome and cilia function, NEURL4 is involved in mitochondrial processes. It acts as a mitochondrial ADP-ribosyltransferase, regulating mitochondrial DNA integrity and function through the ADP-ribosylation of mitochondrial proteins (Cardamone2020ADPribosylation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the NEURL4 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions. NEURL4 is associated with mitochondrial function, and its absence can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by fragmented mitochondria, impaired respiration, and altered gene expression related to metabolic adaptation. This dysfunction is linked to increased mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions and accumulation in the cytoplasm, which can trigger immune responses and contribute to male infertility. NEURL4 heterozygous mice exhibit increased mtDNA deletions in sperm and reduced sperm count, suggesting its crucial role in maintaining mtDNA integrity and male fertility (Cardamone2020ADPribosylation).

NEURL4 has also been identified as a candidate gene in idiopathic male infertility, with significant differential expression observed in testis samples from patients with impaired spermatogenesis. This suggests a potential functional link between NEURL4 mutations or expression alterations and male infertility (Hodžić2020De).

In cancer research, NEURL4 is noted for its role in centrosome homeostasis and genomic integrity. Its down-regulation is observed in several tumors, including those of the prostate and kidney, which are associated with primary cilia loss. This suggests a potential link between NEURL4 expression and cancer progression (Loukil2017The). Additionally, NEURL4 has been associated with mucosal melanoma, indicating its potential involvement in various cancers (Du2021Identification).

## Interactions
NEURL4 is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in centrosome architecture and function. It interacts with CP110, a key regulator of centrosome biogenesis, and CEP97, forming a complex that may regulate centrosome architecture through HERC2-dependent ubiquitylation (AlHakim2012Interaction). NEURL4 also directly interacts with HERC2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and this interaction is essential for NEURL4's ubiquitylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation. The NHR5-6 region of NEURL4 is critical for binding to HERC2 (AlHakim2012Interaction).

NEURL4 localizes to the centrosome, predominantly at the mother centriole, and co-localizes with centriolar markers such as CEP164 and CPAP, indicating its association with centrioles (AlHakim2012Interaction). It also interacts with CP110 to regulate centriolar homeostasis by promoting CP110 ubiquitylation and destabilization, preventing the formation of ectopic microtubule organizing centers (Li2012Neurl4).

In addition to its centrosomal roles, NEURL4 is identified as a mitochondrial ADP-ribosyltransferase, involved in the ADP-ribosylation of mitochondrial proteins, which is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial DNA integrity (Cardamone2020ADPribosylation). These interactions highlight NEURL4's multifaceted role in cellular processes.
