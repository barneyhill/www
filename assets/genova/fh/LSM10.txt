# LSM10

## Overview
LSM10 is a gene that encodes the LSM10 protein, a specialized component of the U7 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex. This protein plays a pivotal role in the 3' end processing of histone pre-mRNA, a critical step in the maturation of histone mRNAs necessary for proper histone gene expression and cell cycle progression (Ghule2009The). The LSM10 protein, in conjunction with LSM11, forms a unique Sm core structure specific to U7 snRNPs, distinguishing it from other snRNPs involved in RNA processing (Pillai2003Unique). This specificity is essential for the correct assembly and function of the U7 snRNP, ensuring the precise processing of histone pre-mRNA. LSM10's involvement in the U7 snRNP complex underscores its importance in maintaining chromatin structure and cell cycle dynamics, with implications for its role in various cancers and potential as a prognostic marker (Ta2021Potential; Sun2022Expression).

## Function
The LSM10 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the U7 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex, which is essential for the 3' end processing of histone pre-mRNA in human cells. This processing is crucial for the maturation of histone mRNAs, which are necessary for proper histone gene expression and cell cycle progression, particularly during the G1/S phase transition (Ghule2009The). In healthy human somatic and embryonic stem cells, LSM10 is part of the U7 snRNP complexes that localize to specific subnuclear domains known as Histone Locus Bodies (HLBs). These domains are sites where histone gene transcription and processing occur, and LSM10 co-localizes with the transcriptional regulator p220 NPAT, reflecting its role in an integrated factory for histone gene expression (Ghule2009The).

LSM10, along with LSM11, forms a unique Sm core structure specific to the U7 snRNPs, which distinguishes it from other snRNPs involved in RNA processing. This specificity is crucial for the proper assembly and function of the U7 snRNP, ensuring the correct processing of histone pre-mRNA (Pillai2003Unique). The presence of LSM10 in HLBs is essential for the coordinated regulation of histone gene expression, impacting chromatin structure and cell cycle dynamics (Ghule2009The).

## Clinical Significance
LSM10 has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels and potential role in disease progression. In breast cancer, LSM10 is significantly overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, with a high rate of genetic alterations observed in patients. This suggests that LSM10 may play a role in breast cancer progression and could serve as a biomarker for tumor stages and prognosis (Ta2021Potential). In skin cutaneous melanoma, LSM10 also shows elevated expression levels, although its expression is not linked to the pathological stages of the disease. Despite this, LSM10, along with other LSM family genes, demonstrates high accuracy in predicting the prognosis of melanoma, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Sun2022Expression).

The role of LSM10 in RNA processing, particularly in the assembly of U7 snRNPs essential for histone RNA processing, highlights its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions. Disruptions in these processes due to mutations or altered expression of LSM10 could contribute to the pathogenesis of diseases where RNA splicing and processing are affected, such as neurodegenerative disorders and various cancers (Schümperli2004The). However, specific clinical implications of LSM10 mutations remain underexplored.

## Interactions
LSM10 is a protein that interacts with LSM11 to form a heterodimer, which is crucial for the assembly and function of the U7 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex. This complex is essential for histone pre-mRNA processing. LSM10 and LSM11 replace the canonical SmD1 and SmD2 proteins in the Sm ring of the U7 snRNP, forming a unique structure that specifically binds U7 snRNA (Godfrey2009TheDrosophilaU7; Pillai2003Unique).

The interaction between LSM10 and LSM11 is necessary for the proper localization of U7 snRNP to the histone locus body (HLB), a site critical for histone mRNA biosynthesis. In the absence of LSM10 and LSM11, the U7 snRNP fails to localize to the HLB, leading to nonfunctional snRNPs (Godfrey2009TheDrosophilaU7).

LSM10 also interacts with the SMN complex, which is involved in the assembly of snRNPs. This interaction is important for ensuring the specificity of the U7 snRNP assembly, preventing the incorporation of incorrect Sm/Lsm proteins, which could be toxic (Pillai2003Unique). The SMN complex containing LSM10 and LSM11 is distinct from those containing other Sm proteins, highlighting the specialized role of LSM10 in U7 snRNP assembly (Pillai2003Unique).
