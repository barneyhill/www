# TAS2R8

## Overview
TAS2R8 is a gene that encodes the protein taste 2 receptor member 8, which is part of the TAS2R family of bitter taste receptors. These receptors belong to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, characterized by their seven transmembrane domains. The TAS2R8 protein is primarily involved in the perception of bitter taste by detecting a variety of bitter compounds on the surface of taste receptor cells in the tongue. Beyond its role in taste, TAS2R8 is expressed in various non-gustatory tissues, including the brain and lung macrophages, suggesting additional physiological roles such as neuronal differentiation and modulation of immune responses (Fotsing2020Discovery; GrassinDelyle2019Bitter; Behrens2016G). The receptor's involvement in cancer research, particularly in neuroblastoma, highlights its potential in promoting differentiation and reducing cancer stemness, indicating broader biological functions beyond taste perception (Seo2017Anticancer).

## Structure
The TAS2R8 protein is a member of the TAS2R family of bitter taste receptors, which are part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are characterized by having seven transmembrane domains (TMDs) connected by three extracellular and three intracellular loops, a common structural feature of GPCRs (Behrens2016G). The amino terminus of TAS2R8 is located extracellularly, while the carboxy terminus is intracellular (Behrens2016G). 

TAS2R8, like other TAS2Rs, is a glycoprotein and may have sites for N-linked glycosylation, which is important for receptor function (Behrens2016G). Although specific details about the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of TAS2R8 are not provided, the general structural characteristics of TAS2Rs suggest a complex folding pattern typical of GPCRs, with potential for oligomerization. TAS2R receptors, including TAS2R8, can form homo- and heterooligomers, although the functional consequences of these formations are not well understood (Kuhn2010Oligomerization). 

The structural diversity among TAS2Rs, including TAS2R8, is reflected in their ability to recognize a wide range of bitter substances, although specific structural determinants for agonist binding in TAS2R8 are not detailed (Behrens2016G).

## Function
TAS2R8 is a member of the TAS2R family of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that primarily mediate the perception of bitter taste in humans. These receptors are located on the surface of taste receptor cells in the tongue and are involved in detecting a wide variety of bitter compounds, triggering signal transduction pathways that result in the perception of bitterness (Fotsing2020Discovery). Beyond taste perception, TAS2R8 is expressed in various non-gustatory tissues, suggesting potential roles in other physiological processes. For instance, TAS2R8 is expressed in the brain and has been implicated in neuronal differentiation and the modulation of cancer stem cell markers in neuroblastoma cells, indicating a role in promoting differentiation and reducing stemness in cancer cells (Seo2017Anticancer).

In addition to its role in taste, TAS2R8 has been studied for its potential involvement in modulating immune responses. It is expressed in human lung macrophages, where it may influence cytokine production and immune function (GrassinDelyle2019Bitter). These findings suggest that TAS2R8 may have broader biological functions beyond taste perception, potentially impacting health and disease processes.

## Clinical Significance
TAS2R8, a bitter taste receptor, has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression or function. In the context of cancer, particularly neuroblastoma, over-expression of TAS2R8 has been associated with anti-cancer properties. It suppresses tumor incidence, reduces metastatic potential, and down-regulates genes involved in tumor invasion and metastasis, such as MMP-2 and P-selectin (Seo2017Anticancer). These findings suggest that TAS2R8 could be a potential target for cancer therapy, although its specific clinical significance in terms of mutations or expression alterations in cancer remains to be fully elucidated (Seo2017Anticancer).

In addition to its role in cancer, TAS2R8 expression is influenced by zinc levels. Zinc deficiency has been shown to inhibit TAS2R8 promoter activity, potentially affecting taste perception. This regulation is mediated by the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), which requires zinc to bind effectively to the TAS2R8 promoter (KOJIMA2020Intracellular). While the clinical implications of these findings are not fully addressed, they highlight the importance of zinc in maintaining proper TAS2R8 expression, which could have broader implications for taste-related disorders.

## Interactions
TAS2R8, a member of the bitter taste receptor family, is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that interacts with various proteins involved in signal transduction pathways. As a GPCR, TAS2R8 likely interacts with G protein subunits, including Gα, Gβ, and Gγ, to mediate taste signal transduction. These interactions are crucial for the receptor's role in detecting bitter compounds and initiating intracellular signaling cascades (Fotsing2020Discovery).

In the context of cancer research, TAS2R8 has been studied for its potential interactions in neuroblastoma cells. Over-expression of TAS2R8 in these cells has been associated with the induction of neuronal differentiation and the suppression of cancer stem cell markers such as DLK1, CD133, Sox2, and Notch1. This suggests that TAS2R8 may interact with pathways regulating cell differentiation and stemness (Seo2017Anticancer). Additionally, TAS2R8 over-expression has been linked to the down-regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and its downstream targets, indicating a possible interaction with hypoxia-related signaling pathways (Seo2017Anticancer).

These interactions highlight the multifaceted roles of TAS2R8 beyond taste perception, suggesting its involvement in cellular processes related to cancer progression and metastasis.
