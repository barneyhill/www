# ZNHIT6

## Overview
ZNHIT6 is a gene that encodes the protein zinc finger HIT-type containing 6, which plays a critical role in the assembly and stabilization of ribonucleoprotein complexes, particularly small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins (snoRNPs). This protein is characterized by its involvement in complex formation with the RUVBL1-RUVBL2 complex, a process enhanced by ATP, indicating its potential role in chromatin remodeling and pre-mRNA processing (Serna2021CryoEM). ZNHIT6 is also implicated in snoRNP biogenesis through its interactions with NUFIP1 and AAA+ ATPases, which are essential for ribosomal RNA processing and modification (Cloutier2017R2TPPrefoldinlike). Mutations in ZNHIT6 can disrupt these processes, leading to impaired ribosome biogenesis and potential implications in cancer biology (Khoshnevis2019A). The protein's interactions are crucial for maintaining cellular functions related to ribosome biogenesis and stress response, underscoring its significance in cellular homeostasis and disease.

## Function
ZNHIT6 is involved in the assembly and stabilization of ribonucleoprotein complexes, particularly through its interactions with the R2TP complex and other proteins. It interacts with the RUVBL1/2 complex in the presence of ATP, but not with individual RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 proteins, suggesting a specific role in complex formation (Lynham2022The). ZNHIT6 also binds to the 15.5K protein, indicating its potential role in the assembly or stabilization of ribonucleoprotein complexes by influencing the stability or assembly of 15.5K (Lynham2022The).

ZNHIT6, along with ZNHIT3, is identified as a factor in snoRNP biogenesis, interacting with NUFIP1 and AAA+ ATPases, which are crucial for ribonucleoprotein complex assembly (Cloutier2017R2TPPrefoldinlike). The interaction of ZNHIT6 with the RUVBL1-RUVBL2 complex is enhanced by ATP, and the HIT domain is suggested to be involved in forming complexes with RUVBL1-RUVBL2 (Serna2021CryoEM). These interactions highlight the role of ZNHIT6 in the assembly of box C/D small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins (snoRNPs), which are essential for the processing and modification of ribosomal RNA (Serna2021CryoEM).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
ZNHIT6, a protein encoded by the human ZNHIT6 gene, is involved in the assembly of box C/D small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins (snoRNPs). It interacts with the RUVBL1-RUVBL2 complex, which is enhanced by the presence of ATP, suggesting a role in chromatin remodeling and pre-mRNA processing (Serna2021CryoEM). ZNHIT6 is also known to interact with NUFIP1 and AAA+ ATPases, indicating its involvement in complex formation with RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 (Cloutier2017R2TPPrefoldinlike).

Mutations in ZNHIT6 can impair snoRNP biogenesis, affecting ribosome biogenesis by altering rRNA processing. Such mutations result in a truncated protein that fails to interact with Snu13 and snoRNAs, potentially allowing cancer cells to exploit these changes to modify snoRNA levels and ribosome biogenesis under stress conditions (Khoshnevis2019A). The protein's interactions are crucial for protecting snoRNAs from rapid turnover during the early stages of snoRNP assembly (Khoshnevis2019A).

These interactions highlight the importance of ZNHIT6 in maintaining proper cellular functions related to ribosome biogenesis and stress response, with potential implications in cancer biology. Further research is needed to fully understand the scope and impact of ZNHIT6 interactions in human cells.
