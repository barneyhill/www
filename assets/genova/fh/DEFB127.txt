# DEFB127

## Overview
DEFB127 is a gene that encodes the protein defensin beta 127, a member of the beta-defensin family, which is known for its role in the innate immune system. Defensin beta 127 is a small, secreted antimicrobial peptide that exhibits activity against a range of microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi, by disrupting their cell membranes. The protein is characterized by a conserved six-cysteine motif that forms disulfide bonds, stabilizing its structure and contributing to its antimicrobial properties (Pazgier2006Human; Hollox2008Directional). In addition to its antimicrobial functions, defensin beta 127 is implicated in reproductive processes, potentially influencing sperm maturation and function (Sidekli2024βdefensin). The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the testis and epididymis, and has been associated with coronary artery disease risk in individuals with type 1 diabetes, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Antikainen2020Genome-wide).

## Structure
DEFB127, a member of the beta-defensin family, is characterized by a primary structure that includes a six-cysteine core motif (C-X6-C-X4-C-X9-C-X6-C-C), which is crucial for forming disulfide bonds that stabilize the protein's structure (Hollox2008Directional). This motif is a defining feature of beta-defensins and contributes to their antimicrobial properties. The secondary structure of beta-defensins typically includes three beta-strands arranged in an antiparallel sheet, constrained by disulfide bridges, and flanked by an alpha-helical segment (Pazgier2006Human). The tertiary structure is defined by a 'defensin-like' topological fold, with the beta-sheet and alpha-helix orientation stabilized by disulfide bridges (Pazgier2006Human).

DEFB127 has a long C-terminal tail with 45 amino acids after the last cysteine and four predicted glycosylation sites, suggesting its involvement in fertility by directly binding to sperm (Sidekli2024βdefensin). The presence of glycosylation sites indicates potential post-translational modifications that may influence its function. While specific details on the quaternary structure of DEFB127 are not provided, beta-defensins can form various oligomeric structures, which may influence their biological activities (Pazgier2006Human).

## Function
DEFB127, also known as beta-defensin 127, is a small secreted antimicrobial peptide that plays a role in the innate immune system. It is primarily involved in preventing microbial colonization on epithelial surfaces by inhibiting the growth of bacteria and fungi. The peptide is cationic, allowing it to attract negatively charged bacteria, diffuse its hydrophobic part onto the bacterial cell membrane, and generate pores, leading to cell death (Antikainen2020Genome-wide). DEFB127 has demonstrated antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and is expressed in various tissues, including the testis, epididymis, heart, pancreas, kidney, skeletal muscle, liver, and lung (Antikainen2020Genome-wide).

In addition to its antimicrobial functions, DEFB127 may play a role in the immune system by chemoattracting immune cells such as memory T-cells and immature dendritic cells, although this function is debated (Antikainen2020Genome-wide). The gene is also suggested to have a role in reproduction, potentially contributing to sperm maturation or function, as indicated by its expression in the epididymis (Hollox2008Directional). The exact mechanisms and selective pressures influencing DEFB127's functions in humans remain subjects of ongoing research (Hollox2008Directional).

## Clinical Significance
DEFB127, or defensin beta 127, has been identified as a potential risk locus for coronary artery disease (CAD) in individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D). A genome-wide association study (GWAS) found a significant association between a variant located 4 kb upstream of DEFB127, known as rs6055069, and increased susceptibility to CAD in this population. This association suggests that DEFB127 may influence CAD risk through mechanisms related to infection susceptibility and chronic inflammation, which are common in individuals with diabetes and contribute to atherosclerosis (Antikainen2020Genome-wide).

The study also noted that the effect size and statistical significance of the DEFB127 variant were reduced when adjusted for diabetic kidney disease (DKD), indicating a possible shared etiology between DKD and CAD or CAD due to DKD (Antikainen2020Genome-wide). Despite these findings, the DEFB127 variant did not replicate in independent studies and was not confirmed in the general population GWAS data, suggesting that its association with CAD may be specific to individuals with T1D (Antikainen2020Genome-wide).
