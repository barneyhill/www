# CYSTM1

## Overview
CYSTM1 is a gene that encodes the cysteine-rich transmembrane module containing 1 protein, which is characterized by its cysteine-rich domains and transmembrane structure. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including transport and cell adhesion, through its interactions with other proteins such as the human organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) and those involved in cancer-related pathways. The protein's involvement in pathways such as 'focal adhesion', 'ECM-receptor interaction', and 'PI3K/Akt signaling' highlights its potential role in cancer progression and cellular response mechanisms (Ciarimboli2021Regulation; Huang2023Prognostic). Despite its emerging significance, the precise biological functions and interaction networks of CYSTM1 remain to be fully elucidated (Du2021CYSTM1:).

## Interactions
CYSTM1, a cysteine-rich transmembrane protein, has been identified as a potential interaction partner for the human organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1), which is involved in the transport of organic cations across the plasma membrane. This interaction was identified using a mating-based split-ubiquitin system, suggesting a role for CYSTM1 in processes related to transport and cell adhesion (Ciarimboli2021Regulation; Snieder2019Identification).

In the context of cancer biology, CYSTM1 interacts with TM4SF1 and DDR1, two proteins highly expressed in ovarian cancer. These interactions are implicated in pathways related to the extracellular matrix, collagen, integrin, and cell adhesion, as well as in the 'focal adhesion', 'ECM-receptor interaction', and 'PI3K/Akt signaling pathway'. These pathways are significant in cancer progression, suggesting that CYSTM1 may influence cell-matrix adhesion and response to cellular stimuli (Huang2023Prognostic).

Despite these findings, the specific physical interactions of CYSTM1 with other proteins or nucleic acids remain largely unexplored. The protein's role in stress response and resistance to DNA-damaging agents has been suggested, but detailed interaction mechanisms are not well-documented (Kong2023Six; Du2021CYSTM1:).
