# RPN2

## Overview
RPN2 is a gene that encodes the protein ribophorin II, a critical component of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex involved in N-linked glycosylation within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Ribophorin II is categorized as a transmembrane protein and plays a pivotal role in the attachment of oligosaccharides to nascent proteins, which is essential for proper protein folding and stability. This function is crucial for maintaining protein quality control and cellular homeostasis (Tominaga2014RPN2mediated; Wang2021Overexpression). The RPN2 gene is implicated in various cellular processes, including the translocation of secretory proteins and the maintenance of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) structure. Alterations in RPN2 expression have been associated with several cancers, where it influences tumor progression, chemoresistance, and interactions with key signaling pathways (Vazquez2020Lysine; Sun2020RPN2).

## Function
Ribophorin II (RPN2) is a component of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, which plays a crucial role in N-linked glycosylation within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This process involves the attachment of oligosaccharides to nascent proteins, which is essential for proper protein folding and stability, thereby maintaining protein quality control and cellular homeostasis (Tominaga2014RPN2mediated). RPN2 is integral to the translocation of secretory proteins and the maintenance of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) structure, highlighting its importance in cellular function (Wang2021Overexpression).

In healthy human cells, RPN2 is involved in the glycosylation of proteins such as CD63, which is important for various cellular processes, including signal transduction and protein localization (Tominaga2014RPN2mediated). The glycosylation process facilitated by RPN2 is critical for the proper functioning of the ER and the overall cellular environment, ensuring that proteins are correctly folded and functional before they are transported to their final destinations within the cell (Tominaga2014RPN2mediated). This function is vital for maintaining the structural integrity and function of the ER, which is essential for the survival and proper functioning of cells.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RPN2 gene have been implicated in various cancers, where it plays a role in tumor progression and chemoresistance. In estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer, RPN2 is upregulated in response to estradiol and lysine, promoting cancer dissemination and correlating with poor survival outcomes. RPN2 is involved in stabilizing mutant p53, facilitating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and contributing to drug resistance (Vazquez2020Lysine).

In gliomas, RPN2 is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis, higher tumor grades, and resistance to the chemotherapy drug temozolomide. It mediates these effects through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and is targeted by miR-181c, which influences glioma progression and drug sensitivity (Sun2020RPN2).

RPN2 is also a significant biomarker in colorectal cancer (CRC), where its overexpression is linked to advanced tumor stages, metastasis, and poor differentiation. It is frequently altered through gene amplification and mRNA overexpression, suggesting its role in CRC progression (Zhang2015Integrated).

In nasopharyngeal cancer, RPN2 is upregulated and essential for cell viability, interacting with the JAK1/STAT3 pathway to regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis (Wang2021Overexpression). These findings highlight RPN2 as a potential therapeutic target across multiple cancer types.

## Interactions
Ribophorin II (RPN2) is a component of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, which is involved in the N-linked glycosylation of proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum. RPN2 interacts with other OST subunits, such as STT3A/B, and is associated with the Sec61 translocon complex, facilitating protein translocation and modification (Kurashige2012RPN2).

RPN2 has been shown to interact with several signaling pathways and proteins across different cancer types. In glioma, RPN2 interacts with glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), affecting the wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This interaction leads to the inactivation of GSK-3β phosphorylation, influencing the expression of pathway targets like c-myc, AKT1, cyclin D1, and TCF4 (Sun2020RPN2). RPN2 is also targeted by miR-181c, which suppresses β-catenin/Tcf-4 activity, indicating a regulatory axis involving miR-181c, RPN2, and the wnt/β-catenin pathway (Sun2020RPN2).

In nasopharyngeal cancer, RPN2 interacts with the JAK1/STAT3 pathway, where it is positively associated with the activation of this pathway, influencing tumor cell survival and apoptosis (Wang2021Overexpression). In myelodysplastic syndromes, RPN2 interacts with enhancer of zeste homolog-2 (EZH2), modulating cell cycle progression and apoptosis (Ren2020Ribophorin).
