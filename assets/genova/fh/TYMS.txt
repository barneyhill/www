# TYMS

## Overview
The TYMS gene encodes the enzyme thymidylate synthase, a critical player in the biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides, specifically deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP), which is essential for DNA replication and repair. Thymidylate synthase is a homodimeric enzyme that functions as a key catalyst in the conversion of deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to dTMP, utilizing 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate as a cofactor. This enzyme is categorized as a transferase due to its role in transferring a methyl group during the synthesis of dTMP. The activity of thymidylate synthase is tightly regulated and linked to the cell cycle, reflecting its importance in rapidly dividing cells. Dysregulation of TYMS expression is implicated in various cancers, where it contributes to tumor progression and affects the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents, making it a significant target for cancer therapy (Guijarro2023TYMS; Kealey2005A).

## Structure
Thymidylate synthase (TYMS) is a homodimeric enzyme, with each monomer contributing to the formation of the active site. The enzyme's primary structure consists of a polypeptide chain with conserved and variable domains. The larger, conserved domain spans residues 1-98 and 130-313, while the smaller, variable domain includes residues 99-129 (Taddia2015Inside). The secondary structure of TYMS is characterized by a series of alpha-helices and beta-sheets, with a significant interface formed by a twisted beta-sheet (Carreras1995THE). 

The tertiary structure of TYMS is compact and globular, facilitating its function in catalysis. The quaternary structure involves a symmetric dimer, with each subunit approximately 30-35 kDa in size (Carreras1995THE). The dimer interface is formed by a five-stranded β-sheet, with 45 residues from each monomer interacting with the opposite monomer (Taddia2015Inside).

TYMS contains a conserved folate-binding domain, crucial for its enzymatic activity. The enzyme is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may affect its function and regulation. Splice variants of TYMS may exist, potentially influencing its activity and interaction with other cellular components.

## Function
The TYMS gene encodes thymidylate synthase, an enzyme crucial for DNA synthesis and repair. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP), which is essential for pyrimidine biosynthesis and, consequently, DNA replication and repair (Kealey2005A). The reaction catalyzed by thymidylate synthase is the sole intracellular de novo source of dTMP, making it vital for maintaining the dTMP pool necessary for DNA replication and repair processes (Trinh2002Thymidylate).

Thymidylate synthase requires 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (methylene-THF) as a cofactor to perform its function. This cofactor is also involved in the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine, linking the enzyme's activity to the folate/homocysteine metabolic pathway (Kealey2005A). The enzyme's activity is regulated at both transcriptional and translational levels and is dependent on the cell cycle and cell proliferation state (Horie1995Functional). In healthy human cells, thymidylate synthase is active in the cytoplasm, where it supports cell proliferation and organismal growth, particularly in rapidly dividing cells (Kealey2005A).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TYMS gene, which encodes thymidylate synthase, have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. Overexpression of TYMS is associated with genomic instability and tumor progression, especially in the context of Ink4a/Arf null backgrounds. This overexpression accelerates tumor growth, enhances metastasis, and decreases survival in mouse models, suggesting that high TYMS levels directly drive tumor growth and invasiveness (Guijarro2023TYMS). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), aberrant TYMS expression is linked to patient outcomes and can influence the effectiveness of chemotherapy regimens, particularly those involving taxanes and platinum-based treatments (Kotoula2012Expression).

TYMS polymorphisms also play a role in cancer treatment outcomes. For instance, specific polymorphisms in the TYMS gene can predict sensitivity and toxicity to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) chemotherapy in breast cancer patients (Junior2012Thymidylate). In colorectal cancer, TYMS gene variants are associated with clinical response and toxicity to fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy, with certain genotypes linked to both positive treatment responses and severe toxicity (CastroRojas2017Thymidylate). These findings highlight the potential of targeting TYMS expression and genetic variants to improve cancer treatment strategies.

## Interactions
Thymidylate synthetase (TYMS) is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for its function in DNA synthesis and regulation. TYMS participates in a multiprotein complex known as the 'replitase', which is associated with DNA replication machinery. This complex includes enzymes like dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1 (SHMT1), and methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1 (MTHFD1), and is essential for de novo dTMP synthesis. The nuclear localization of TYMS and its interaction with these enzymes are regulated by SUMOylation, which facilitates their import into the nucleus (Chon2017Targeting).

TYMS also interacts with a G-quadruplex forming sequence (G4FS) located in its own 5' untranslated region (5'UTR). This interaction is specific and involves the binding of TYMS protein to both single-stranded DNA and RNA forms of the G4FS, as confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (Aubets2020Detection). The G4FS is proposed to play a role in the autoregulation of TYMS expression, potentially influencing transcriptional and translational processes (Aubets2020Detection). These interactions highlight the multifunctional nature of TYMS in cellular processes and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.
