# EFEMP1

## Overview
EFEMP1, or EGF containing fibulin extracellular matrix protein 1, is a gene that encodes the protein fibulin-3, a secreted extracellular matrix glycoprotein. Fibulin-3 is characterized by its involvement in the structural integrity and function of the extracellular matrix (ECM), playing a significant role in ECM remodeling, cell proliferation, and organogenesis. As a member of the fibulin family, fibulin-3 is involved in interactions with various ECM molecules and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, contributing to the regulation of angiogenesis and vascular development (Cheng2021EFEMP1; Ellinghaus2017Genomewide). The protein's structure is defined by its disulfide-rich nature, with multiple calcium-binding epidermal growth factor (EGF) domains that are essential for its function and stability (Collier2024A). Mutations in EFEMP1 have been linked to several diseases, including Doyne honeycomb retinal dystrophy and connective tissue disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Tarttelin2001Molecular; Bizzari2020Recessive).

## Structure
The EFEMP1 gene encodes the protein fibulin-3, which is a secreted extracellular matrix glycoprotein. Fibulin-3 is characterized by its disulfide-rich nature, containing forty cysteine residues distributed across one atypical and five canonical calcium-binding epidermal growth factor (EGF) domains. These domains are crucial for the protein's structure, secretion, and function, as they facilitate disulfide bonding, which is essential for maintaining its complex tertiary structure (Collier2024A). 

Fibulin-3 has a monomeric molecular weight of approximately 54.6 kDa and typically forms dimers under native conditions, as indicated by size exclusion chromatography (Collier2024A). The protein is involved in interactions with various extracellular matrix molecules, including tropoelastin and matrix metalloproteinases, which suggests its role in modulating ECM biology (Verlee2021LossofFunction).

Mutations in the cysteine residues of fibulin-3 can lead to altered disulfide bonding and misfolding, affecting its secretion and function. These mutations can result in physiological stress responses and are associated with diseases such as connective tissue disorders and retinal dystrophies (Collier2024A). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications like glycosylation, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context.

## Function
The EFEMP1 gene encodes fibulin-3, a secreted extracellular matrix glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in healthy human cells. Fibulin-3 is involved in ECM remodeling, cell proliferation, and organogenesis, contributing to the organization and stabilization of ECM structures during processes such as vasculogenesis and organ development (Cheng2021EFEMP1; Sadr‐Nabavi2009Decreased).

Fibulin-3 is known to interact with tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), particularly TIMP-3, which regulates matrix composition and affects angiogenesis. This interaction is significant in maintaining ECM homeostasis by inhibiting matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that degrade the ECM (Sadr‐Nabavi2009Decreased; Ellinghaus2017Genomewide). In endothelial cells, fibulin-3 antagonizes vessel development by repressing MMP-2 and MMP-3 expression while inducing TIMP-1 and TIMP-3, thus playing a role in vascular remodeling and angiogenesis inhibition (Ellinghaus2017Genomewide; Albig2006Fibulins).

Fibulin-3 is highly expressed in various endothelial cells, including human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), where it contributes to the regulation of angiogenesis and vascular development (Ellinghaus2017Genomewide). Its expression and activity are crucial for maintaining normal cellular and tissue homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the EFEMP1 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. One of the primary conditions linked to EFEMP1 mutations is Doyne honeycomb retinal dystrophy (DHRD), also known as Malattia Leventinese. This condition is characterized by the formation of drusen in the retina, leading to vision impairment, and is associated with the autosomal dominant mutation p.(Arg345Trp) (Narendran2004Analysis; Tarttelin2001Molecular).

In addition to retinal dystrophies, EFEMP1 mutations have been implicated in connective tissue disorders. A novel recessive connective tissue disorder has been identified, characterized by symptoms such as hernias, marfanoid habitus, and joint laxity, linked to a homozygous mutation p.(Cys55Arg) in EFEMP1 (Bizzari2020Recessive). Another study reported a connective tissue disorder in a 9-year-old boy with cutis laxa and multiple herniations, associated with biallelic loss-of-function variants in EFEMP1 (Verlee2021LossofFunction).

EFEMP1 has also been associated with biliary atresia, a rare pediatric liver disease. Genome-wide association studies have identified EFEMP1 as a susceptibility locus for this condition, suggesting its potential role in liver and bile duct development (Chen2018A).

## Interactions
EFEMP1, also known as fibulin-3, is involved in various interactions with proteins that influence signaling pathways and cellular processes. In pancreatic carcinoma cells, EFEMP1 activates AKT signaling by binding to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (Hu2011EFEMP1). However, in glioma cell lines, EFEMP1 reduces the levels of total EGFR and phosphorylated AKT, indicating a suppressive effect on these pathways (Hu2011EFEMP1). EFEMP1 overexpression also decreases the phosphorylation of AKT substrates, including FOXO transcription factors and BCL-2 family proteins, which are crucial for cell survival (Hu2011EFEMP1).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, EFEMP1 influences apoptosis by affecting the expression of Caspase family members and Bcl-2 family proteins, promoting apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway (Hu2019Epidermal). EFEMP1's interaction with Semaphorin 3B (SEMA3B) is significant in regulating apoptosis and cell proliferation in HCC cells (Hu2019Epidermal).

In malignant pleural mesothelioma, EFEMP1 activates the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, enhancing tumor cell proliferation and invasion (Roshini2022The). These interactions highlight EFEMP1's role in modulating oncogenic signaling and cellular behavior across different cancer types.
