# MEPCE

## Overview
MEPCE, or methylphosphate capping enzyme, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which functions as a critical component of the 7SK small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex. This protein is categorized as an enzyme due to its role in catalyzing the addition of a γ-monomethyl phosphate cap to the 5' end of 7SK small nuclear RNA (snRNA), a modification essential for RNA stability and protection against degradation (Jeronimo2007Systematic; Xue2009A). The MEPCE protein is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it interacts with LARP7 to form a stable subcomplex within the 7SK snRNP, contributing to the regulation of RNA polymerase II transcription and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Schneeberger2019de; Xue2009A). Mutations in the MEPCE gene have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer progression, underscoring its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Schneeberger2019de; Zhang2020Long).

## Function
MEPCE, also known as methylphosphate capping enzyme, plays a crucial role in the stabilization of 7SK small nuclear RNA (snRNA) in healthy human cells. It achieves this by adding a unique γ-monomethyl phosphate cap to the 5' end of 7SK snRNA, which is essential for protecting the RNA from degradation and maintaining its stability (Jeronimo2007Systematic; Xue2009A). This capping process is vital for the assembly and function of the 7SK small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex, which sequesters the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) in an inactive state, thereby regulating RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) activity and transcription elongation (Schneeberger2019de; Xue2009A).

MEPCE interacts with LARP7 to form a stable subcomplex within the 7SK snRNP, which is resistant to stress conditions that typically disrupt other components of the complex (Xue2009A). This interaction is crucial for the stability of 7SK snRNA and the proper functioning of the 7SK snRNP complex, which in turn regulates gene expression and cellular homeostasis (Schneeberger2019de; Xue2009A). MEPCE is primarily active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the regulation of transcription and the maintenance of normal cellular functions (Schneeberger2019de).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MEPCE gene, specifically de novo nonsense variants such as c.1552 C > T/p.(Arg518*), are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. These mutations lead to the disintegration of the 7SK snRNP complex, resulting in increased activation of RNA polymerase II and dysregulated gene expression. This dysregulation is linked to developmental delay, moderate intellectual disability, intractable seizures, and exercise intolerance in affected individuals (Schneeberger2019de).

MEPCE haploinsufficiency, caused by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay of mutated transcripts, results in reduced MEPCE protein levels. This reduction destabilizes the 7SK snRNP complex, leading to increased P-TEFb activity and hyperphosphorylation of RNA polymerase II. Consequently, there is an upregulation of genes such as ID2, ID3, and MRPL11, which are implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders (Schneeberger2019de).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), MEPCE is involved in a regulatory axis with the long non-coding RNA ST8SIA6-AS1 and miR-338. Alterations in this axis contribute to the aggressive behavior of HCC cells under hypoxic conditions, highlighting MEPCE's role in cancer progression (Zhang2020Long).

## Interactions
MEPCE, also known as the methylphosphate capping enzyme, is a crucial component of the 7SK snRNP complex, which regulates RNA polymerase II transcription. MEPCE interacts with the 7SK snRNA by adding a unique γ-monomethyl phosphate cap to its 5' end, which is essential for the stability of the snRNA (Muniz2013RNA; Xue2009A). This interaction is facilitated by specific RNA elements within the 7SK snRNA, particularly the 5'-terminal G1-A3/U106-C108 helix and adjacent unpaired nucleotides, which are critical for MEPCE binding (Muniz2013RNA).

MEPCE also forms a stable subcomplex with LARP7 and 7SK snRNA within the 7SK snRNP. This subcomplex remains intact even under stress conditions that typically disrupt other components of the 7SK snRNP, such as Cdk9, CycT1, and HEXIM1 (Xue2009A). The interaction between MEPCE and LARP7 is independent of 7SK snRNA, indicating a direct contact that does not rely on the presence of the RNA (Muniz2013RNA). LARP7 can recruit MEPCE to the 7SK snRNP, even in the absence of a direct 7SK-MePCE contact, highlighting the importance of LARP7 in the assembly and stability of the complex (Muniz2013RNA).
