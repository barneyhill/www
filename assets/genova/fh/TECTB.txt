# TECTB

## Overview
The TECTB gene encodes the tectorin beta protein, a key structural component of the tectorial membrane (TM) in the cochlea of the inner ear. Tectorin beta is categorized as a structural protein due to its role in forming the striated-sheet matrix of the TM, which is essential for auditory function. This protein, in conjunction with tectorin alpha (TECTA) and CEACAM16, contributes to the mechanical properties of the TM, facilitating sound transmission and frequency discrimination (Goodyear2018Structure; Cheatham2014Loss). The TECTB gene's expression and the protein's interactions are critical for maintaining the TM's integrity, and mutations in TECTB can lead to auditory impairments, highlighting its clinical significance in hearing-related conditions (Niazi2024Microvilli; Goodyear2018Structure).

## Function
The TECTB gene encodes the tectorin beta protein, a critical component of the tectorial membrane (TM) in the cochlea of the inner ear. This protein is essential for maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the TM, which is crucial for normal auditory function. Tectorin beta, along with tectorin alpha (TECTA) and CEACAM16, contributes to the formation of the striated-sheet matrix within the TM, where collagen fibrils are embedded (Goodyear2018Structure; Cheatham2014Loss).

TECTB contains a zona pellucida (ZP) domain, a protein polymerization module that may aid in forming the filaments of the striated-sheet matrix. The interaction between TECTA and TECTB is vital for the structural integrity of the TM, as TECTB is unlikely to form filaments independently in the absence of TECTA (Goodyear2018Structure). The TM's mechanical properties, influenced by the striated-sheet matrix, are essential for sound transmission and frequency discrimination in the cochlea (Jones2015Modified).

Mutations in TECTB can lead to defects in the TM structure, affecting cochlear tuning and traveling wave properties, which are critical for hearing (Goodyear2018Structure). The protein's role in the TM highlights its importance in the molecular processes underlying auditory function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the TECTB gene can lead to significant auditory impairments, primarily affecting the tectorial membrane in the inner ear. This membrane plays a crucial role in the auditory process, and disruptions in its function can result in sensorineural hearing loss. Sensorineural hearing loss is a condition where the root cause lies in the inner ear or the neural pathways to the brain, rather than in the outer or middle ear. Changes in the expression levels of TECTB or its interactions with other components of the auditory system can disrupt normal auditory function, contributing to various auditory-related conditions. These alterations may impair the mechanical properties of the tectorial membrane, affecting its ability to transmit sound waves effectively, which is essential for proper hearing. Understanding the specific mutations and their impacts on TECTB function is crucial for developing targeted therapies and interventions for individuals affected by these auditory conditions.

## Interactions
TECTB, or tectorin beta, is a protein that plays a crucial role in the structure of the tectorial membrane (TM) in the inner ear, which is essential for hearing. TECTB interacts with other proteins to form the striated-sheet matrix of the TM. It contains a zona pellucida (ZP) domain, which is a protein polymerization module that may contribute to filament formation within the TM. There is a hypothesis that TECTB and TECTA, another protein in the TM, could form homomeric filaments that are cross-linked by CEACAM16, or they might interact via their ZP domains to form heteropolymeric filaments (Goodyear2018Structure).

The interactions between TECTB and TECTA are significant for the formation of the TM's structure. TECTB expression is higher in GER cells, and its knockout impairs the formation of the striated sheet in the adult TM, indicating its essential role in maintaining the structural integrity of the TM (Niazi2024Microvilli). However, there is limited direct evidence for the specific structural interactions between CEACAM16 and TECTA/TECTB, and the exact nature of these interactions remains a subject of study (Goodyear2018Structure). There is no mention of TECTB interacting with nucleic acids in the provided context.
