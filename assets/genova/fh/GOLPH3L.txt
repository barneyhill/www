# GOLPH3L

## Overview
GOLPH3L (Golgi phosphoprotein 3-like) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of Golgi apparatus morphology and function. The protein, also named GOLPH3L, is a member of the Golgi phosphoprotein family and acts as a regulatory factor within the Golgi complex. Unlike its paralog GOLPH3, GOLPH3L does not bind to the myosin motor protein MYO18A, but instead serves as an antagonist to the GOLPH3/MYO18A complex, thereby influencing Golgi structure and function (Ng2013GOLPH3L). GOLPH3L is predominantly expressed in secretory tissues and plays a critical role in maintaining Golgi integrity and facilitating efficient protein secretion (Ng2013GOLPH3L). Its interactions within the Golgi apparatus, particularly its binding to phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, underscore its importance in cellular processes such as secretion and membrane trafficking (Buschman2015The; Sechi2015The). Additionally, GOLPH3L has been implicated in cancer progression, with altered expression levels associated with poor prognosis in ovarian and breast cancers (He2017The; Xu2021The).

## Function
GOLPH3L (Golgi phosphoprotein 3-like) is involved in maintaining Golgi morphology and function in healthy human cells. It is a paralogue of GOLPH3 and shares the ability to bind phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P), localizing to the Golgi apparatus. However, unlike GOLPH3, GOLPH3L does not effectively bind to MYO18A, a myosin motor protein, and instead antagonizes the effects of the GOLPH3/MYO18A complex on Golgi morphology (Ng2013GOLPH3L).

GOLPH3L is expressed predominantly in secretory tissues, such as the salivary gland, small intestine, and skin, where it plays a role in efficient anterograde trafficking and secretion. It functions by promoting Golgi compaction, counteracting the dispersal effect induced by GOLPH3, thus maintaining the structural integrity of the Golgi apparatus (Ng2013GOLPH3L).

The protein's role in modulating Golgi structure is crucial for cellular secretion processes, as both GOLPH3 and GOLPH3L are required for efficient protein secretion. Knockdown of either gene results in decreased secretory flux, highlighting GOLPH3L's importance in maintaining normal Golgi function and preventing overexuberant secretion (Ng2013GOLPH3L).

## Clinical Significance
GOLPH3L is implicated in the progression and prognosis of several cancers, notably ovarian and breast cancer, through its altered expression levels. In ovarian cancer, GOLPH3L is overexpressed in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, correlating with poor prognosis and increased resistance to cisplatin, a common chemotherapy drug. This resistance is linked to the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which contributes to cancer aggressiveness and chemoresistance (He2017The). High GOLPH3L expression is associated with shorter survival times and earlier relapse in ovarian cancer patients, suggesting its potential as a predictive biomarker for disease outcome and treatment response (He2017The).

In breast cancer, GOLPH3L is also overexpressed and is associated with poor patient prognosis. It promotes tumorigenesis by enhancing cell proliferation, survival, and migration. The gene's expression is negatively regulated by miRNA-1185-2-3p, which is linked to better prognosis in breast cancer patients (Xu2021The). GOLPH3L influences glucose metabolism in breast cancer cells by stabilizing SERPINE1, a process that is crucial for cancer cell proliferation and survival (Xu2021The). These findings highlight GOLPH3L as a potential therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
GOLPH3L is involved in various interactions within the Golgi apparatus, primarily functioning as a broad-spectrum COPI adaptor for sorting proteins into intra-Golgi transport vesicles. It interacts with the short, positively charged cytoplasmic tails of numerous Golgi-resident proteins, which is crucial for their retention and stability within the Golgi stack (Welch2021GOLPH3). These interactions are facilitated by membrane-proximal polybasic stretches on the client proteins, allowing GOLPH3L to bind effectively (Welch2021GOLPH3).

GOLPH3L also binds to phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P), a phosphoinositide that plays a role in Golgi localization, although it does not bind to MYO18A, unlike its paralog GOLPH3 (Buschman2015The; Sechi2015The). This binding to PtdIns(4)P suggests a role in regulating Golgi morphology and function, acting as a dominant-negative inhibitor of the GOLPH3 pathway, which is involved in Golgi-to-plasma membrane trafficking (Buschman2015The).

The interactions of GOLPH3L with Golgi-resident enzymes and other proteins are essential for maintaining the fidelity of glycosylation processes and proper Golgi function (Welch2021GOLPH3). These interactions highlight GOLPH3L's role in cellular processes such as secretion and membrane trafficking.
