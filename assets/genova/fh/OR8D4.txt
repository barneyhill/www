# OR8D4

## Overview
The OR8D4 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 8 subfamily D member 4, which is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This receptor is primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the olfactory system by binding specific odorants and initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell (HorieInoue2006Identification). The OR8D4 protein is characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure, typical of GPCRs, which allows it to traverse the cell membrane and interact with various ligands (Kajii2019Wholeexome). Beyond its role in olfaction, OR8D4 has been implicated in androgen-responsive pathways in prostate cancer cells, suggesting a broader biological significance (HorieInoue2006Identification). Despite its involvement in various physiological processes, the full spectrum of OR8D4's functions and its clinical implications remain areas of active research (Nijboer2021Identification).

## Structure
The OR8D4 gene encodes an olfactory receptor that is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure. This structure is typical of many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors, allowing the receptor to traverse the cell membrane seven times (Kajii2019Wholeexome). The primary structure of OR8D4 consists of an amino acid sequence that forms the protein, with a length of 384 amino acids (Ye2023GenomeWide). 

The secondary structure of OR8D4 includes alpha helices that span the cell membrane, a common feature of GPCRs. These helices contribute to the receptor's ability to interact with various ligands and initiate signal transduction pathways. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices into a functional receptor capable of binding specific odorant molecules.

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation may occur, influencing the receptor's function and localization within the cell. These modifications can affect the receptor's stability, signaling efficiency, and interaction with other cellular components. The OR8D4 receptor functions as a monomer, and thus, quaternary structure is not applicable in this context.

## Function
OR8D4 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein belonging to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is involved in the detection of odor molecules. These receptors are primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where they bind specific odorants, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell (HorieInoue2006Identification). The OR8D4 gene is part of the largest gene family in mammalian genomes, with humans having between 500-750 olfactory receptor genes (HorieInoue2006Identification).

In addition to its role in olfaction, OR8D4 has been identified as an androgen receptor target gene in prostate cancer LNCaP cells, where it shows increased mRNA levels in response to androgen, suggesting its involvement in androgen-responsive pathways (HorieInoue2006Identification). However, the specific function of OR8D4 in healthy human cells remains to be fully characterized, and its role outside the olfactory system is not well understood (Nijboer2021Identification). Despite this, the gene's potential regulation by sex steroid hormones indicates a broader biological significance beyond olfactory perception (HorieInoue2006Identification).

## Clinical Significance
The OR8D4 gene, which encodes an olfactory receptor, has been implicated in several conditions through genetic studies. In a study involving a Japanese pedigree, a non-synonymous single-nucleotide variant (SNV) in OR8D4 was identified in individuals affected by mandibular prognathism, suggesting a potential role in the development of this condition (Kajii2019Wholeexome). However, the study ultimately highlighted a different gene, BEST3, as a more plausible candidate for mandibular prognathism, indicating that the role of OR8D4 in this condition remains uncertain (Kajii2019Wholeexome).

In the context of nicotine addiction, OR8D4 has been mentioned as a gene that may contribute to nicotine dependence by affecting taste perception, although the specific mechanisms remain unclear (IbañezTallon2014SmokingRelated). Additionally, OR8D4 was identified as one of the top mutated genes in African-American breast cancer patients, although the study did not provide specific details on the clinical implications of these mutations (Dutta2022Genetic). Overall, while OR8D4 has been associated with various conditions, its precise clinical significance and the mechanisms by which it may influence these conditions require further investigation.
