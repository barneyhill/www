# BHMT2

## Overview
Betaine--homocysteine S-methyltransferase 2 (BHMT2) is a gene that encodes a monomeric enzyme involved in the methylation of homocysteine to methionine, utilizing S-methylmethionine (SMM) as a methyl donor. This enzyme is distinct from its paralog, BHMT, which forms a tetramer and uses betaine as a methyl donor. BHMT2 plays a critical role in methionine and glutathione biosynthesis, impacting cellular methylation reactions and liver function. The protein is primarily expressed in the liver and kidney, with its activity being crucial for maintaining homocysteine levels and supporting cardiovascular health. BHMT2's interactions with other proteins, such as BHMT, form hetero-oligomeric complexes that enhance methionine production, particularly under conditions of low methionine or S-adenosylmethionine levels (Ganu2015Evolutionary; Portillo2020Proteinprotein). The gene's involvement in metabolic pathways and its association with various clinical conditions, such as metabolic-associated fatty liver disease and congenital anomalies, underscore its significance in human health (Marini2016Sequence; Ma2021Combined).

## Structure
The BHMT2 protein is composed of 363 amino acids and is a monomeric enzyme, unlike its homolog BHMT, which forms a tetramer of identical subunits (Ganu2015Evolutionary). BHMT2 shares 73% sequence identity with BHMT but lacks 34 amino acids at the C-terminus, which are involved in the oligomerization of BHMT into its tetrameric structure (Ganu2015Evolutionary; Li2008Human). This absence contributes to BHMT2's monomeric nature and its tendency to aggregate, potentially affecting its catalytic activity (Li2008Human).

The protein lacks the nine tandem amino acids within the N-terminal region that confer betaine specificity to BHMT, and it cannot use betaine as a methyl donor. Instead, BHMT2 uses S-methylmethionine (SMM) for methylation (Ganu2015Evolutionary). The absence of the C-terminal α-helix in BHMT2 reduces its oligomer stability, suggesting that a heterotetrameric BHMT-BHMT2 association could stabilize it (Garrido2018Identification).

BHMT2's structure includes a conserved zinc-binding domain, similar to BHMT, which is crucial for its enzymatic function (Zhu2005Are). The protein's instability and rapid degradation in mammalian cells suggest challenges in its structural stability (Li2008Human).

## Function
The BHMT2 gene encodes the enzyme betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase 2, which plays a crucial role in the methylation of homocysteine to methionine using S-methylmethionine (SMM) as a methyl donor. This process is important for maintaining homocysteine levels and supporting methionine metabolism, which is vital for cellular methylation reactions and overall cardiovascular health (Ganu2015Evolutionary). BHMT2 is primarily expressed in the liver and kidney, with modest expression in skeletal muscle, brain, and heart tissues, although its enzymatic activity is mainly detected in the liver and kidney cortex (Ganu2015Evolutionary).

BHMT2 is a monomeric protein that utilizes catalytic zinc to activate substrates for methyl transfer, distinguishing it from its paralog BHMT, which forms a tetramer (Ganu2015Evolutionary). Unlike BHMT, BHMT2 cannot use betaine as a methyl donor, highlighting its specificity for SMM in the methionine/glutathione biosynthesis pathway (Liu2009An). This pathway is crucial for cysteine and glutathione biosynthesis, impacting liver function and potentially offering protection against acetaminophen-induced liver toxicity (Liu2009An). BHMT2's role in these metabolic processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
BHMT2 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in homocysteine metabolism and lipid regulation. Elevated expression of BHMT2 is associated with metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), where it is believed to increase phosphatidylcholine synthesis, thereby reducing liver lipid accumulation. Conversely, BHMT2 deficiency can lead to fatty liver, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for MAFLD (Ma2021Combined).

Genetic variations in BHMT2 have been linked to congenital conditions such as cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CLP). Studies have shown significant associations between BHMT2 variants and CLP risk, particularly in specific ethnic groups, suggesting a complex genetic risk profile (Marini2016Sequence). 

BHMT2 variants have also been associated with congenital heart disease (CHD), specifically obstructive CHD, although these variants are considered benign due to their high frequency in the general population (Karas2024Congenital). 

Additionally, alterations in BHMT2 expression or mutations may influence the risk of early-onset ischemic stroke, as certain gene haplotypes involving BHMT2 have been independently associated with stroke risk (Saracini2010Earlyonset).

## Interactions
BHMT2 (betaine--homocysteine S-methyltransferase 2) is involved in several protein-protein interactions that play a role in methionine metabolism. It interacts with BHMT (betaine homocysteine S-methyltransferase), forming a hetero-oligomeric complex that is beneficial for homocysteine recycling. This interaction enhances methionine production, particularly under conditions of low methionine or S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) levels, as BHMT2 uses S-methylmethionine as a methyl donor, producing more methionine per mole of homocysteine than BHMT (Garrido2018Identification; Portillo2020Proteinprotein).

The BHMT-BHMT2 interaction is strong and possibly favored in the presence of salt due to their high sequence identity and similar structural features, except for the C-terminal α-helix absent in BHMT2, which results in reduced stability. The formation of a heterotetrameric BHMT-BHMT2 complex may enhance BHMT2 stability and methionine production (Garrido2018Identification).

BHMT2 also interacts with proteins such as INPPL1 and tubulin-specific chaperone E (TBCE), although the functional roles of these interactions are not well understood (Portillo2020Proteinprotein). These interactions are part of a broader network regulating AdoMet synthesis, highlighting the complexity of BHMT2's role in cellular metabolism (Portillo2020Proteinprotein).
