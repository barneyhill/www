# LRRC75A

## Overview
The LRRC75A gene encodes the protein leucine rich repeat containing 75A, which is characterized by the presence of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs. These motifs are typically involved in protein-protein interactions, suggesting that LRRC75A may play a role in cellular signaling or structural organization. While the specific biological functions of LRRC75A remain to be fully elucidated, proteins with LRR motifs are often implicated in diverse processes such as immune response, cell adhesion, and signal transduction. Further research is needed to clarify the precise role of LRRC75A in these or other cellular pathways.
