# RAP2C

## Overview
RAP2C is a gene that encodes a small GTPase protein, which is a member of the RAS oncogene family. The RAP2C protein plays a pivotal role in various intracellular signaling pathways, particularly those mediated by G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in fibroblasts and epithelial cells. As a small GTPase, RAP2C is involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics, cellular proliferation, and the maintenance of epithelial barrier function. It acts as an upstream activator in signaling cascades that influence the phosphorylation and localization of key transcriptional regulators such as YAP and TAZ, thereby impacting cellular responses to external stimuli and contributing to processes like fibroblast activation and epithelial permeability (Choi2021GPCR‐mediated; Monteiro2013JAMA). Additionally, RAP2C has been implicated in oncogenic pathways, with its dysregulation associated with various cancers and other pathological conditions, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Wu2021[Corrigendum]; Wang2020&lt; Rap2c; p&gt).

## Function
RAP2C, a member of the RAS oncogene family, is a small GTPase involved in various intracellular signaling pathways. In healthy human cells, RAP2C plays a significant role in GPCR-mediated signaling pathways, particularly in fibroblasts. It is involved in the regulation of YAP/TAZ phosphorylation and nuclear localization, which are crucial for fibroblast activation and function. RAP2C acts as an upstream activator in the signaling cascade that includes EPAC1/2 and MAP4K7, leading to the phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion of YAP and TAZ. This process is essential for reducing fibroblast proliferation, contraction, and extracellular matrix production, thereby influencing fibroblast biology and potentially impacting fibrotic diseases (Choi2021GPCR‐mediated).

RAP2C is also involved in maintaining epithelial barrier function. It is activated by a complex involving JAM-A, ZO-2, afadin, and PDZ-GEF1, which regulates epithelial permeability. This activation is crucial for controlling the contraction of the junction-associated apical cytoskeleton, thereby maintaining a functional and selectively permeable epithelial barrier (Monteiro2013JAMA). RAP2C's activity is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane, where it participates in cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular responses to external stimuli.

## Clinical Significance
RAP2C, a member of the RAS oncogene family, has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression or interactions. In glioma, a type of malignant brain tumor, RAP2C is significantly upregulated compared to normal brain tissues. High RAP2C expression is associated with poor prognosis, as it correlates with reduced 5-year overall survival rates in glioma patients. RAP2C promotes glioma cell migration and invasion through the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Wang2020&lt; Rap2c; p&gt).

In osteosarcoma, RAP2C enhances the migratory and invasive abilities of cancer cells by increasing matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) activity and decreasing tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2 (Timp2) levels. This process is mediated through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, highlighting RAP2C's role in tumor progression and metastasis (Wu2021[Corrigendum]).

RAP2C is also involved in intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD), where it promotes apoptosis and inflammation in nucleus pulposus cells via ERK signaling. The microRNA miR-200c-3p targets RAP2C, and its downregulation in IDD patients suggests a regulatory mechanism that could be exploited for therapeutic purposes (Cao2021MicroRNA‑200c‑3p).

## Interactions
RAP2C, a member of the RAS oncogene family, participates in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with Junctional Adhesion Molecule-A (JAM-A) and is part of a complex with ZO-2, afadin, and PDZ-GEF1, which is essential for maintaining epithelial barrier function. This complex activates RAP2C, influencing actomyosin contraction via RhoA activation (Monteiro2013JAMA). RAP2C also colocalizes with JAM-A at cell junctions and is involved in regulating epithelial permeability (Monteiro2013JAMA).

In fibroblasts, RAP2C acts as an upstream activator in the GPCR-mediated YAP/TAZ inactivation pathway, interacting with EPAC1/2 and MAP4K7. This interaction is significant for the phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion of YAP/TAZ, affecting fibroblast activation (Choi2021GPCR‐mediated). RAP2C is also targeted by microRNAs, such as miR-200c-3p and miR-496, which modulate its expression and influence pathways like ERK signaling and cancer cell proliferation (Yin2021Serum; Cao2021MicroRNA‑200c‑3p). These interactions highlight RAP2C's role in various cellular processes, including epithelial integrity, fibroblast biology, and oncogenic pathways.
