# HMOX2

## Overview
HMOX2 is a gene that encodes the enzyme heme oxygenase 2, which is a crucial component in the heme degradation pathway. This enzyme is categorized as an oxidoreductase and is primarily involved in the conversion of heme into biliverdin, carbon monoxide, and ferrous iron. Heme oxygenase 2 is constitutively expressed, with significant activity in the brain, testes, and neural tissues, where it plays a vital role in cellular antioxidant defense and the regulation of vascular tone. The protein's structure includes a heme-binding domain and unique heme regulatory motifs that facilitate redox-dependent interactions with heme. These structural features enable HMOX2 to participate in oxygen sensing and modulation of vascular responses, particularly under varying oxygen conditions. The gene's expression and function are implicated in several physiological processes and pathological conditions, including inflammation, apoptosis, and cell proliferation (Ayer2016Heme; Bagai2015Spectroscopic; Ryter2022Heme).

## Structure
HMOX2, also known as heme oxygenase-2, is an enzyme involved in heme degradation. The primary structure of HMOX2 includes a sequence of amino acids encoded by the HMOX2 gene, with a molecular weight of approximately 36,000 (Maines1997THE). The secondary structure of HMOX2 features an α-helical fold that forms the catalytic core and heme-binding site, similar to its isoform HMOX1 (Bagai2015Spectroscopic). The tertiary structure includes a heme-binding domain, crucial for its enzymatic activity, and a hydrophobic C-terminal region that anchors the protein to the microsomal membrane (Ayer2016Heme; Bagai2015Spectroscopic).

HMOX2 contains unique heme regulatory motifs (HRMs) near the C-terminus, which are involved in redox-dependent heme binding. These HRMs are dynamically disordered in the oxidized state but gain structure under reducing conditions, suggesting a redox-dependent interaction with heme (Bagai2015Spectroscopic). The HRMs may form an independent heme-binding site, as indicated by spectroscopic studies (Bagai2015Spectroscopic). HMOX2 does not typically form quaternary structures like its isoform HMOX1. The protein is constitutively expressed, particularly in the brain, testes, and neural tissues (Bagai2015Spectroscopic).

## Function
HMOX2, or heme oxygenase 2, is a constitutively expressed enzyme that plays a critical role in heme catabolism, converting heme into biliverdin, carbon monoxide (CO), and ferrous iron. This process is essential for cellular antioxidant defense and the regulation of vascular tone (Ayer2016Heme; Ryter2022Heme). HMOX2 is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it is anchored by a hydrophobic region at its COOH terminus (Ayer2016Heme).

In healthy human cells, HMOX2 is involved in oxygen sensing, particularly in the brain and testis, where it is most highly expressed. It modulates oxygen sensing via the BK Ca2+ channel in the carotid body, utilizing a thiol/disulfide redox switch that regulates its affinity for heme. Under normoxic conditions, HMOX2 produces CO, which inhibits hydrogen sulfide (H2S) formation, while under hypoxic conditions, reduced CO production allows increased H2S, stimulating carotid body sensory nerve activity (Ayer2016Heme).

HMOX2 also contributes to the regulation of cerebral vessel tone and is implicated in maintaining vascular health, particularly in response to conditions like hypoxia and epileptic seizures (Ayer2016Heme). Its activity influences cellular processes such as inflammation, apoptosis, and cell proliferation (Ryter2022Heme).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the HMOX2 gene have been associated with various diseases and conditions. In the context of ischemic acute kidney injury (AKI), HMOX2 plays a protective role, particularly in aged males. Deficiency in HMOX2 exacerbates renal damage and inflammation, leading to worsened outcomes in ischemic AKI. This is partly due to the upregulation of proinflammatory signaling molecules like phosphorylated STAT3, which are implicated in kidney injury (Nath2019Heme).

HMOX2 polymorphisms have also been linked to age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Specifically, the -42 + 1444A[G-HMOX2 polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of dry AMD, while the G/G genotype appears to reduce this risk. These genetic variations may influence AMD occurrence and progression through their role in oxidative stress management (Synowiec2011An).

In the context of hypoxic conditions, the HMOX2 rs4786504 polymorphism affects hypoxic ventilatory responses. Individuals with the C/C genotype exhibit higher ventilatory responses to hypoxia, suggesting a potential protective effect against high-altitude illnesses such as acute mountain sickness (Fabries2022The). These findings highlight the clinical significance of HMOX2 in various physiological and pathological processes.

## Interactions
Heme oxygenase 2 (HMOX2) is involved in heme catabolism and interacts with heme through its heme regulatory motifs (HRMs). These motifs are dynamically disordered and exhibit redox-dependent interactions with heme. In the reduced state, the HRMs gain structure and interact with the catalytic core of HMOX2, with cysteine residues playing a crucial role in binding to ferric heme (Bagai2015Spectroscopic). The HRMs, particularly the cysteine-proline diad, are involved in heme binding when the protein is in the disulfide-reduced state, with evidence of sulfur coordination to the metal center (Bagai2015Spectroscopic).

HMOX2 has been identified as a target for the near-infrared probe TiNIR, which binds specifically to HMOX2 in a noncovalent manner. This interaction is characterized by a concentration-dependent increase in fluorescence emission, with a dissociation constant (KD) of 0.38 μM. The specificity of TiNIR for HMOX2 over its subtype HMOX1 highlights the unique binding properties of HMOX2 (Kim2019A). However, specific physical interactions of HMOX2 with other proteins or nucleic acids have not been detailed in the available studies (Kim2019A; Homan2022A).
