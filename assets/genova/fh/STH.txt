# STH

## Overview
The STH gene encodes the Saitohin protein, which is a small, cytoplasmic protein involved in neurobiological processes. Saitohin is notable for its interactions with the tau protein and the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Abl, both of which are significant in the context of neurodegenerative diseases. The protein's interaction with tau is particularly relevant due to tau's critical role in maintaining axonal microtubule stability and its implication in disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies. Saitohin's interaction with c-Abl involves phosphorylation, which is modulated in an allele-specific manner, suggesting a nuanced role in cellular signaling pathways. Although the STH gene is located within the tau gene, its polymorphisms, such as Q7R, have been studied for associations with neurodegenerative diseases, with mixed results regarding their clinical significance (Streffer2003Saitohin; Wang2011Saitohin).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The Saitohin (STH) gene, located within the tau gene, has been studied for its potential role in neurodegenerative diseases. A specific polymorphism in STH, known as Q7R, has been associated with susceptibility to several neurodegenerative conditions, including progressive supranuclear palsy, frontotemporal dementia, and Parkinson's disease (Wang2011Saitohin). The Q allele of this polymorphism is human-specific and is over-represented in certain neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting a possible role in these conditions (Wang2011Saitohin).

Despite initial suggestions of an association between the STH polymorphism and Alzheimer's disease, several studies have found no significant link. Research involving case-control studies in different populations concluded that there is no evidence supporting an association between STH polymorphisms and Alzheimer's disease (Zuo2006Variation; Streffer2003Saitohin). These findings align with earlier studies that also found no connection between MAPT polymorphisms and Alzheimer's (Streffer2003Saitohin).

The STH gene interacts with tau and the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Abl, influencing phosphorylation processes that may be relevant to its role in disease contexts (Wang2011Saitohin). However, no specific diseases or conditions have been directly attributed to mutations in the STH gene (Żekanowski2003Mutation).

## Interactions
The Saitohin (STH) protein, encoded by the STH gene, is known to interact with the tau protein and the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Abl (Abl). STH interacts with tau at comparable levels across its alleles, and specific deletion mutants of STH, such as STHD5, maintain strong interactions with tau, while others like STH100 show weaker binding (Wang2011Saitohin). The interaction between STH and tau is significant due to tau's role in axonal microtubule organization and its association with neurodegenerative diseases (Wang2011Saitohin).

STH also interacts with Abl, with the interaction being slightly weaker for certain STH mutants compared to the full-length protein. Notably, the PXXP motif at residues 106-109 of STH is not required for Abl binding. Abl phosphorylates STH on its single tyrosine residue (Y78), which is crucial for this interaction, as demonstrated by the lack of phosphorylation in the Y78F mutant (Wang2011Saitohin). STH influences Abl-mediated phosphorylation in an allele-specific manner, suggesting a role in modulating tyrosine phosphorylation, which could impact neurodegenerative processes (Wang2011Saitohin).
