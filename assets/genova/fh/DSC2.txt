# DSC2

## Overview
The DSC2 gene encodes desmocollin 2, a protein that is a member of the cadherin superfamily and plays a pivotal role in cell-cell adhesion within desmosomes. Desmocollin 2 is a transmembrane protein that is integral to the structural integrity of tissues subjected to mechanical stress, such as cardiac and intestinal tissues. It is the only desmocollin isoform expressed in cardiac tissue, where it interacts with other desmosomal proteins to maintain the mechanical stability of the heart. In the intestinal epithelium, desmocollin 2 contributes to mucosal homeostasis and wound repair. Mutations in the DSC2 gene are linked to several cardiac disorders, including arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining cardiac function (Beffagna2007Missense; Gehmlich2010Mechanistic; Flemming2020Desmocollin-2).

## Structure
Desmocollin 2 (DSC2) is a protein that is part of the cadherin superfamily and plays a crucial role in cell-cell adhesion within desmosomes. The primary structure of DSC2 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form various domains, including four highly conserved extracellular cadherin domains (EC1-4), an extracellular anchor domain (EA), a transmembrane domain (TM), and an intracellular anchor domain (IA) (Beffagna2007Missense). The secondary structure of DSC2 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its compact tertiary structure. The quaternary structure involves interactions with other desmosomal proteins, facilitating its role in cell adhesion.

DSC2 undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which are common in membrane glycoproteins (Reimer2023The). The protein is synthesized as an inactive precursor with a prosequence that is cleaved in the Golgi apparatus, activating its adhesive properties (Beffagna2007Missense). DSC2 exists in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, with the 'a' variant having a slightly longer cytoplasmic domain compared to the 'b' variant, whose function is not well understood (Beffagna2007Missense). These structural features are essential for its function in maintaining the integrity of tissues under mechanical stress, such as cardiac tissue.

## Function
Desmocollin-2 (DSC2) is a desmosomal cadherin that plays a crucial role in cell-cell adhesion, particularly in tissues subjected to mechanical stress, such as the heart and intestinal mucosa. In cardiac tissue, DSC2 is the only desmocollin isoform expressed and is integral to the structure and function of desmosomes, which are specialized cell structures that provide mechanical stability by anchoring intermediate filaments at sites of strong intercellular adhesion (Beffagna2007Missense; Gehmlich2010Mechanistic). DSC2 interacts with other desmosomal proteins, such as desmoglein-2, plakoglobin, and plakophilin-2, to maintain the integrity of cardiac cells, contributing to the heart's ability to withstand mechanical strain during contraction (Gehmlich2010Mechanistic).

In intestinal epithelial cells, DSC2 is involved in maintaining mucosal homeostasis by regulating cell adhesion and migration, which are essential for efficient wound repair. DSC2 influences the expression of integrin subunits and Rap1 GTPase activity, which are crucial for cell-matrix adhesion and epithelial cell migration during wound healing (Flemming2020Desmocollin-2). This function is vital for the repair and maintenance of the intestinal mucosal barrier (Flemming2020Desmocollin-2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DSC2 gene are associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), a condition characterized by the replacement of myocardial tissue with fibrofatty tissue, leading to arrhythmias and an increased risk of sudden cardiac death (Beffagna2007Missense; Gehmlich2010Mechanistic). Specific mutations such as DSC2 R203C, L229X, T275M, and G371fsX378 have been identified, which affect the protein's ability to localize correctly and function within desmosomes, crucial for cell-cell adhesion in cardiac tissue (Gehmlich2010Mechanistic). These mutations can lead to a reduction in functional desmosomal components, contributing to the pathogenesis of ARVC by disrupting the mechanical and electrical integrity of cardiomyocytes (Gehmlich2010Mechanistic).

In addition to ARVC, DSC2 mutations have been implicated in other cardiac conditions, such as left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). A novel truncated mutation, DSC2 p.K47Rfs*2, has been associated with these conditions, leading to complex arrhythmias and heart failure (Lin2021Overlap). These findings highlight the clinical significance of DSC2 mutations in various cardiomyopathies and their potential impact on cardiac health.

## Interactions
Desmocollin 2 (DSC2) is a desmosomal cadherin that plays a crucial role in cell-cell adhesion by interacting with various proteins within the desmosome complex. DSC2 interacts with plakoglobin (PG) and plakophilin-2 (PKP2), which are essential for maintaining the structural integrity of desmosomes in cardiac tissue. These interactions are critical for the proper localization and function of desmosomal components at the intercalated discs of cardiomyocytes (Gehmlich2010Mechanistic).

Mutations in DSC2 can significantly affect its binding capabilities. For instance, the DSC2 A897fsX900 mutation shows a dramatic reduction in binding to PG, while its interaction with PKP2 is only mildly affected. This mutation also reduces binding to desmoplakin (DSP) by 50% compared to the wild-type DSC2 (Gehmlich2010Mechanistic). The DSC2 R203C mutation fails to localize at cell borders and is absent from desmosomal structures, indicating a loss of functional interaction with other desmosomal proteins (Gehmlich2010Mechanistic).

DSC2 also engages in both homophilic and heterophilic interactions with other cadherins, such as desmoglein 2 (DSG2). These interactions are calcium-dependent, with DSC2 showing a higher affinity for homodimerization compared to heterodimerization (SYED2002Molecular). The presence of calcium influences the structural conformation of DSC2, enhancing its binding interactions (SYED2002Molecular).
