# RHOT1

## Overview
The RHOT1 gene encodes the Miro1 protein, a mitochondrial Rho GTPase that plays a pivotal role in mitochondrial dynamics and transport. Miro1 is a transmembrane protein located on the outer mitochondrial membrane, characterized by two GTPase domains and two calcium-binding EF-hand motifs, which are essential for its function in mitochondrial movement and calcium homeostasis (Grossmann2020The; Panchal2021Miro). The protein facilitates the transport of mitochondria along the cytoskeleton by interacting with motor proteins such as kinesin and dynein, thereby maintaining mitochondrial distribution crucial for cellular energy supply and signaling (Nahacka2021Miro). Mutations in RHOT1 have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, due to their impact on mitochondrial function and quality control mechanisms (Chemla2023Parkinson’s; Grossmann2019Mutations). As such, RHOT1 and its encoded protein Miro1 are of significant interest in the study of mitochondrial biology and related pathologies.

## Structure
The RHOT1 gene encodes the Miro1 protein, a member of the Miro GTPases family, which is crucial for mitochondrial dynamics and transport. Miro1 is composed of 662 amino acids and is characterized by two GTPase domains and two calcium-binding EF-hand motifs (Grossmann2020The; Panchal2021Miro). The N-terminal GTPase domain is essential for mitochondrial transport in both retrograde and anterograde directions, while the C-terminal GTPase domain is involved in retrograde transport and calcium-related functions (Grossmann2020The). These domains are connected by a linker region known as 'MiroS', which links the EF-hand domains to the C-terminal GTPase domain (Nahacka2021Miro).

The EF-hand motifs are helix-loop-helix structures that bind calcium ions, playing a role in regulating mitochondrial movement and homeostasis (Panchal2021Miro; Nahacka2021Miro). Miro1 also contains a C-terminal transmembrane domain that anchors it to the outer mitochondrial membrane (Fagbadebo2022A). The protein's structure facilitates interactions with motor proteins like kinesin and dynein, which are essential for mitochondrial transport along microtubules (Panchal2021Miro).

Mutations in RHOT1, such as R272Q and R450C, have been linked to Parkinson's disease, affecting conserved domains of Miro1 and potentially impacting calcium binding, GTP hydrolysis, and mitochondrial localization (Grossmann2020The; Grossmann2019Mutations).

## Function
The RHOT1 gene encodes the Miro1 protein, a mitochondrial Rho GTPase that plays a crucial role in mitochondrial dynamics and transport. Miro1 is embedded in the outer mitochondrial membrane and is involved in linking mitochondria to motor proteins such as kinesin and dynein, facilitating their movement along the cytoskeleton (Nahacka2021Miro). This transport is essential for maintaining mitochondrial distribution within cells, which is critical for energy provision and cellular signaling (Panchal2021Miro).

Miro1 contains two GTPase domains and two EF-hand calcium-binding motifs, which are important for its function in calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial movement (Grossmann2020The). The protein is involved in regulating endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contact sites, which are crucial for calcium signaling and mitochondrial function (Grossmann2019Mutations). Miro1 also plays a role in mitophagy, a process that clears dysfunctional mitochondria, and is linked to the PINK1/Parkin pathway, which is essential for mitochondrial quality control (Grossmann2020The).

In pancreatic β-cells, RHOT1 is vital for insulin secretion, as it maintains mitochondrial dynamics necessary for ATP production, which is required for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (Rönn2023Genes). Deficiency in RHOT1 can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, affecting insulin secretion and contributing to metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes (Rönn2023Genes).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RHOT1 gene, which encodes the Miro1 protein, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). These mutations, such as p.R272Q and p.R450C, lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, characterized by impaired calcium homeostasis, increased oxidative stress, and loss of dopaminergic neurons, both in vitro and in vivo (Chemla2023Parkinson’s; Grossmann2019Mutations). The p.R272Q mutation, in particular, is associated with transcriptomic deregulation of major PD-related pathways, affecting neurogenesis, synapse contacts, and mitochondrial apoptosis (Chemla2023Parkinson’s).

RHOT1 mutations disrupt endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contact sites, leading to decreased mitochondrial mass and altered calcium signaling, which are critical for maintaining cellular health (Nahacka2022Miro; Grossmann2019Mutations). These disruptions result in increased mitochondrial fragmentation and impaired mitophagy, contributing to the neurodegenerative processes observed in PD (Grossmann2020The).

The clinical significance of RHOT1 mutations is underscored by their role in mitochondrial quality control and their interaction with other PD-related proteins, such as LRRK2 and α-synuclein, which further influence mitochondrial transport and degradation processes (Grossmann2020The). These findings suggest that RHOT1 is a potential target for therapeutic intervention in PD.

## Interactions
RHOT1, also known as Miro1, is a mitochondrial Rho GTPase that participates in several critical protein interactions. It interacts with the motor adaptor proteins TRAK1 and TRAK2, which link mitochondria to kinesin and dynein motor proteins, facilitating mitochondrial transport along the cytoskeleton. TRAK1 is primarily involved in axonal transport, while TRAK2 is associated with dendritic transport (Grossmann2020The).

RHOT1 also interacts with PINK1 and Parkin, proteins involved in mitochondrial quality control through mitophagy. PINK1 phosphorylates Miro1, marking it for degradation by Parkin, which is crucial for the removal of damaged mitochondria (Hsieh2016Functional; Safiulina2019Mitochondrial). The interaction with Parkin is calcium-dependent, with RHOT1 acting as a calcium-sensing docking site for Parkin (Safiulina2019Mitochondrial).

Additionally, RHOT1 interacts with LRRK2, another protein linked to Parkinson's disease. The LRRK2G2019S mutation disrupts the removal of Miro1 from the outer mitochondrial membrane, impairing mitophagy (Hsieh2016Functional). RHOT1 also forms complexes with proteins like RAC1, ARP2/3, and β-actin, which are involved in actin cytoskeleton reorganization and mitochondrial transfer under hypoxic conditions (Jing2024HMGB1).
