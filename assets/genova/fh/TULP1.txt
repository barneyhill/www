# TULP1

## Overview
TULP1 (TUB like protein 1) is a gene that encodes a member of the tubby-like protein family, which is characterized by a conserved tubby domain. This domain is integral to the protein's function, facilitating its role as a transcription factor and its interaction with cellular membranes. The TULP1 protein is primarily expressed in the retina, where it plays a crucial role in the trafficking and localization of phototransduction proteins within photoreceptor cells. This function is essential for maintaining photoreceptor health and visual processes. Mutations in the TULP1 gene are linked to several inherited retinal disorders, including retinitis pigmentosa and Leber congenital amaurosis, underscoring its clinical significance in retinal health and disease (Boggon1999Implication; Guo2014Advantage; Hagstrom2011Tulp1).

## Structure
The TULP1 protein, encoded by the TULP1 gene, is a member of the tubby-like protein family characterized by a conserved tubby domain at the COOH-terminus. This domain is crucial for its function, as it forms a unique helix-filled barrel structure that binds avidly to double-stranded DNA (Santagata2001G-Protein; Carroll2004Tubby). The tubby domain also contains a DNA-binding domain and a phosphatidylinositol-binding region, which anchors the protein to the cell membrane (Carroll2004Tubby).

Mutations in TULP1, particularly those affecting the DNA binding groove, are associated with retinitis pigmentosa type 14 (RP-14), suggesting the importance of this domain in photoreceptor survival (Boggon1999Implication; Santagata2001G-Protein). The protein's structure includes a positively charged DNA binding groove, which is essential for its role as a transcription factor (Boggon1999Implication).

TULP1 is primarily localized in the nucleus, and its NH2-terminal region contains low-complexity sequences similar to transcription activation domains, which can stimulate RNA transcription (Boggon1999Implication). The protein may also undergo alternative splicing, affecting its transcriptional activity (Boggon1999Implication).

## Function
TULP1 (TUB like protein 1) is a gene that encodes a protein crucial for the function of photoreceptor cells in the retina. In healthy human cells, TULP1 is primarily expressed in photoreceptor cells and plays a significant role in the trafficking of proteins, particularly in the transport of phototransduction proteins from the inner segment (IS) to the outer segment (OS) of these cells (Hagstrom2011Tulp1; Xi2005Tubby-like). This transport is essential for maintaining the correct localization of proteins such as rhodopsin, which is vital for photoreceptor function and visual processes (Grossman2011Immunocytochemical).

TULP1 interacts with the actin cytoskeleton, suggesting its involvement in cytoskeletal functions such as membrane trafficking and protein movement within photoreceptor cells (Xi2005Tubby-like). It associates with cellular membranes, likely through binding to phosphorylated phospholipids, and colocalizes with actin in various parts of the photoreceptor cells, including the inner segment and outer limiting membrane (Xi2005Tubby-like). This interaction indicates that TULP1 may play a role in maintaining photoreceptor cell health through cytoskeletal and membrane-related processes (Xi2005Tubby-like).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TULP1 gene are associated with several inherited retinal disorders, including Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) and retinitis pigmentosa (RP). LCA is a severe form of retinal dystrophy characterized by early-onset retinal degeneration, and TULP1 mutations account for approximately 1-2% of LCA cases (Guo2014Advantage). These mutations can lead to the production of misfolded proteins that accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), causing prolonged ER stress and activating the unfolded protein response (UPR), which results in photoreceptor cell death (Lobo2016Involvement).

In retinitis pigmentosa, TULP1 mutations are linked to both early-onset and adult-onset forms of the disease. These mutations can cause protein instability and improper folding, contributing to photoreceptor degeneration (Woodard2020A; Bodenbender2023Biallelic). Specific mutations, such as the p.P388S missense mutation, have been identified in consanguineous families and are associated with night blindness and other RP symptoms (Woodard2020A). The TULP1 gene is also implicated in cone dystrophy and cone-rod dystrophy, with biallelic pathogenic variants leading to a range of clinical presentations (Bodenbender2023Biallelic).

## Interactions
TULP1 (TUB like protein 1) is involved in several critical interactions within photoreceptor cells. It interacts with the neuronal-specific GTPase Dynamin-1, a protein essential for vesicle formation and trafficking. This interaction is crucial for maintaining photoreceptor health and function, as TULP1 and Dynamin-1 colocalize in the synaptic region and inner segments of photoreceptor cells. The interaction is conformation-dependent, requiring the full-length Dynamin-1 protein (Xi2007Interaction).

TULP1 also interacts with microtubule-associated proteins MAP1A and MAP1B in the retina. These interactions are important for the transport of proteins from the inner segment to the outer segment of photoreceptor cells. Disruption of TULP1 affects the localization of these MAPs, potentially leading to disorganized outer segments (Grossman2014Interaction).

Additionally, TULP1 forms heterodimers or heterooligomers with tubby, another member of the tubby protein family. This interaction stimulates retinal pigment epithelium phagocytosis through MerTK-dependent signaling, highlighting TULP1's role in cellular processes beyond photoreceptor maintenance (Caberoy2014Synergistic). These interactions underscore TULP1's involvement in the complex molecular pathways that sustain photoreceptor cell function.
