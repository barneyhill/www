# COL18A1

## Overview
The COL18A1 gene encodes the collagen type XVIII alpha 1 chain, a non-fibrillar collagen primarily associated with basement membranes. This protein is integral to the structural integrity and function of various tissues, including the eye, liver, and skeletal muscle, due to its role in maintaining basement membrane stability and facilitating cell-matrix interactions (Heljasvaara2017Collagen; Seppinen2011The). Collagen type XVIII is expressed in multiple isoforms, each contributing to its diverse functional roles. Notably, the C-terminal endostatin domain of collagen XVIII exhibits potent antiangiogenic properties, influencing processes such as endothelial cell proliferation and migration, thereby playing a critical role in inhibiting angiogenesis and tumor growth (Seppinen2011The). Mutations in the COL18A1 gene are linked to various clinical conditions, including Knobloch syndrome and certain forms of glaucoma, highlighting its significance in human health and disease (Seppinen2011The; Suri2018COL18A1).

## Structure
The COL18A1 gene encodes collagen type XVIII alpha 1 chain, a non-fibrillar collagen associated with basement membranes. The protein is expressed in three isoforms: short, medium, and long, which differ in their N-terminal non-collagenous sequences but share collagenous and C-terminal non-collagenous domains (Heljasvaara2017Collagen; Seppinen2011The). The short isoform is directed by promoter P1 and includes a unique signal peptide, while the medium and long isoforms are directed by promoter P2 and share a distinct signal peptide and an N-terminal domain of unknown function (DUF959) (Heljasvaara2017Collagen).

The structure of collagen XVIII includes ten triple-helical collagenous domains interrupted by non-collagenous sequences, providing flexibility (Heljasvaara2017Collagen). The C-terminal NC1 domain contains the endostatin region, a 20 kDa globular protein crucial for its stability and activity, and a trimerisation domain necessary for the formation of the triple helix (Heljasvaara2017Collagen). The long isoform uniquely contains a frizzled-like domain with Wnt-inhibiting activity (Heljasvaara2017Collagen).

Post-translational modifications include glycosylation, with glycosaminoglycan attachment sites primarily carrying heparan sulfate side chains (Heljasvaara2017Collagen; Seppinen2011The). The protein's molecular weight in tissues ranges from 200 to 300 kDa due to these modifications (Heljasvaara2017Collagen). The gene's exon-intron organization allows for alternative splicing, contributing to the diversity of its isoforms (Elamaa2003Characterization).

## Function
The COL18A1 gene encodes collagen type XVIII alpha 1 chain, a crucial component of the extracellular matrix, particularly in basement membranes (BMs) across various tissues. This protein plays a significant role in maintaining BM integrity and structural stability, which is essential for normal tissue function (Heljasvaara2017Collagen). Collagen XVIII is involved in cell-matrix interactions and is essential for ocular development and visual function (Marneros2005Physiological). It is expressed ubiquitously in vascular and epithelial BMs, with different isoforms present in various tissues, including the eye, liver, and skeletal muscle (Seppinen2011The).

The C-terminal endostatin domain of collagen XVIII is known for its antiangiogenic properties, inhibiting angiogenesis and tumor growth by affecting endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis (Seppinen2011The). This domain interacts with multiple BM components, contributing to the compact structure of BMs (Heljasvaara2017Collagen). In the eye, collagen XVIII is crucial for the structural integrity and function of the retinal pigment epithelium and Bruch's membrane, which are essential for retinal health (Marneros2005Physiological). The protein's involvement in these molecular processes underscores its importance in maintaining healthy human cells and tissue homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the COL18A1 gene are primarily associated with Knobloch syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by high myopia, vitreoretinal degeneration, retinal detachment, macular abnormalities, and occipital encephalocele. Some patients also exhibit defects in neuronal migration, which may predispose them to epilepsy (Seppinen2011The; Paisán‐Ruiz2009Homozygosity; PassosBueno2006Mutations). Specific mutations, such as a 14 base pair deletion in exon 42, lead to frameshifts and premature stop codons, resulting in truncated proteins and loss of function (Haghighi2014Homozygosity). 

Alterations in COL18A1 expression are linked to various conditions. Increased levels of collagen XVIII are observed in Alzheimer's disease, cerebral malaria, traumatic brain injury, and bullous scleroderma (Seppinen2011The). The gene is also implicated in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma and is considered a candidate gene for atopy (Seppinen2011The). 

In the context of eye diseases, COL18A1 mutations are associated with primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG). A specific mutation, c.550G>A, has been identified as a likely cause of angle closure, with the condition typically manifesting later in life (Suri2018COL18A1). Variants in COL18A1 may also influence the age of onset of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) (Wiggs2013Variations).

## Interactions
The COL18A1 gene encodes collagen type XVIII alpha 1 chain, which is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. Collagen XVIII is processed to release endostatin, a potent angiogenesis inhibitor that interacts with multiple receptors and proteins. Endostatin binds to integrins such as α5β1 and αVβ3/αVβ5, inhibiting their activity on endothelial cells (Poluzzi2016Endostatin). It also interacts with the heparan sulfate chains of proteoglycans, with glypican identified as a low-affinity binding partner (Poluzzi2016Endostatin). Endostatin binds to vascular endothelial growth factor receptors VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, affecting signaling pathways like p125FAK, ERK, and p38MAP kinase (Poluzzi2016Endostatin).

In the context of kidney fibrosis, endostatin interacts with transglutaminase 2 (TG2) in a calcium-dependent manner, specifically via arginine residues Arg-27 and Arg-139 (Lin2016Endostatin). This interaction is significant in aging kidneys, where endostatin is overexpressed and associated with fibrosis (Lin2016Endostatin). Additionally, endostatin can form amyloid-like structures that bind to neuronal cells, potentially compromising their survival in Alzheimer's disease (Heljasvaara2017Collagen). These interactions highlight the complex role of COL18A1 in various physiological and pathological processes.
