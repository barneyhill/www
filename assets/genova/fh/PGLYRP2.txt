# PGLYRP2

## Overview
PGLYRP2 is a gene that encodes the protein peptidoglycan recognition protein 2, which is a member of the peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP) family. This protein functions as an N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase, playing a pivotal role in the innate immune system by hydrolyzing bacterial peptidoglycan, thereby modulating immune responses and preventing excessive inflammation (Dziarski2006Thepeptidoglycanrecognitionproteins(PGRPs); Dziarski2004Peptidoglycan page 2 of 4). Unlike other PGRPs, PGLYRP2 is not a transmembrane protein but is secreted into the bloodstream, where it acts as a scavenger of proinflammatory peptidoglycan (Wang2005Peptidoglycan). The protein is constitutively expressed in the liver and can be induced in epithelial cells by bacterial exposure and cytokines, particularly through the p38 MAPK pathway (Wang2005Peptidoglycan). PGLYRP2 is involved in various physiological and pathological processes, including maintaining mucosal homeostasis, regulating inflammation, and contributing to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases such as arthritis and psoriasis (Park2011Peptidoglycan; Scholz2018Regulation).

## Structure
PGLYRP2, also known as serum N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase (NAMLAA), is a protein with a molecular mass of approximately 80 kDa, which is larger than its calculated mass of 60 kDa due to glycosylation. It contains three N-glycosylation sites: N56ATE, N346ATK, and N464YTA, with confirmed glycosylation at N464 (Zhang2005Identification). The protein undergoes cleavage of a 21-amino acid signal peptide coded by exon 1, resulting in the mature protein (Zhang2005Identification). A critical disulfide bond between C398 and C404 is necessary for its amidase activity, and this bond is conserved across mammalian and insect PGRPs (Zhang2005Identification).

PGLYRP2 is not a transmembrane protein and contains hydrophobic domains that likely serve other functions (Zhang2005Identification). The protein undergoes several post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and deamidation, which may regulate its activity or degradation (Zhang2005Identification). The major form of PGLYRP2 is coded by the cDNA sequence AF384856, with no evidence of alternative splice forms (Zhang2005Identification). The protein's structure includes an amidase domain essential for its enzymatic activity (Zhang2005Identification).

## Function
PGLYRP2, or peptidoglycan recognition protein 2, is an N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase that plays a crucial role in the innate immune response by hydrolyzing bacterial peptidoglycan. This enzymatic activity reduces the proinflammatory potential of peptidoglycan, thereby modulating immune responses and preventing excessive inflammation (Dziarski2006Thepeptidoglycanrecognitionproteins(PGRPs) page 2 of 4; Dziarski2004Peptidoglycan page 0 of 4). PGLYRP2 is constitutively produced in the liver and secreted into the bloodstream, where it acts as a scavenger of proinflammatory peptidoglycan, helping to maintain immune homeostasis (Dziarski2004Peptidoglycan; Wang2005Peptidoglycan).

In epithelial cells, PGLYRP2 expression is induced by bacterial exposure and cytokines, particularly through the p38 MAPK pathway, which is involved in stress and inflammatory responses (Wang2005Peptidoglycan). This inducible expression is crucial for the protein's role in maintaining mucosal homeostasis and regulating inflammation, especially in the gut and oral mucosa, where it helps prevent inappropriate inflammation and supports a balanced microbiome (Scholz2018Regulation). PGLYRP2's activity is not mediated by Toll-like receptors TLR2 or TLR4, distinguishing its pathway from other immune responses (Wang2005Peptidoglycan).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PGLYRP2 gene have been associated with various inflammatory diseases. In the context of chemotherapy-induced gastrointestinal toxicity (CIGT) in mice, PGLYRP2 has been shown to exacerbate weight loss, suggesting a complex role in inflammation and gastrointestinal conditions (Bech2021Peptidoglycan). In psoriasis-like skin inflammation, PGLYRP2 plays a protective role by promoting regulatory T cells and limiting Th17 responses. Mice deficient in PGLYRP2 exhibit increased sensitivity to inflammation, characterized by higher levels of Th17 cells and cytokines such as IL-17 and IL-22, which are crucial for the inflammatory response (Park2011Peptidoglycan).

PGLYRP2 is also implicated in the development of arthritis. In PGLYRP2 knockout mice, there is a reduced induction of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in response to bacterial stimuli, indicating its role as a proinflammatory mediator. This gene is essential for the development of peptidoglycan- and muramyl dipeptide-induced arthritis, as its absence leads to resistance against these conditions (Saha2009PGLYRP2). Additionally, PGLYRP2 has been identified as a potential biomarker for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), with higher serum levels correlating with increased disease activity and altered lipid metabolism (Li2021PGLYRP2).

## Interactions
PGLYRP2 interacts with several proteins and receptors to modulate immune responses and inflammation. It works in conjunction with Nod2, a key receptor for peptidoglycan and muramyl dipeptide (MDP), to induce its expression and mediate inflammatory responses. This interaction is crucial for the development of peptidoglycan-induced arthritis and local inflammation, as both PGLYRP2 and Nod2 are required for these processes (Saha2009PGLYRP2). PGLYRP2 also synergizes with Toll-like receptors TLR2 and TLR4, enhancing their response to bacterial components, which suggests a role in modulating immune responses, particularly in the context of arthritis (Saha2009PGLYRP2).

In keratinocytes, PGLYRP2 expression is induced by bacteria through the p38 MAPK pathway, independent of TLR2 and TLR4, indicating a distinct regulatory mechanism for its activation (Wang2005Peptidoglycan). The p38 MAPK pathway involves the phosphorylation of MKK6 and p38 MAPK, which is necessary for the induction of PGLYRP2 expression (Wang2005Peptidoglycan). This pathway highlights the role of PGLYRP2 in responding to bacterial stimuli and stress signals in epithelial cells.
