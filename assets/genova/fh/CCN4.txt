# CCN4

## Overview
CCN4, also known as WISP1 (WNT1-inducible signaling pathway protein 1), is a gene that encodes a matricellular protein involved in various cellular processes, including wound healing, tissue repair, and bone formation. The protein, cellular communication network factor 4, is characterized by its four conserved domains: an insulin-like growth factor binding protein-like domain, a von Willebrand factor C repeat domain, a thrombospondin type 1 repeat domain, and a C-terminal cysteine knot domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and the extracellular matrix (Yeger2007The; Holbourn2009Proteins). CCN4 is a member of the CCN family of proteins and plays a crucial role in modulating signaling pathways that influence cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation (Singh2024An). Its involvement in pathological conditions, such as cancer and fibrosis, underscores its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Liu2022Stromal; Singh2024An).

## Structure
CCN4, also known as WISP1, is a protein encoded by the WISP1 gene located on chromosome 8q24.22 in humans. The protein consists of 367 amino acids and has a molecular mass of approximately 40 kDa (Singh2024An). Its structure is characterized by four conserved domains: an insulin-like growth factor binding protein-like domain (IGFBP), a von Willebrand factor C repeat (VWC) domain, a thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSP1) domain, and a C-terminal cysteine knot (CT) domain (Yeger2007The; Holbourn2009Proteins). These domains are encoded by exons 2 to 5, with exon 1 encoding the signal peptide (Singh2024An).

The IGFBP domain is involved in modulating insulin-like growth factors, although CCN4 has a lower affinity for IGFs compared to traditional IGFBPs (Holbourn2009Proteins). The VWC domain has a 'boot-like' shape and is involved in protein oligomerization (Holbourn2009Proteins; Planque2003A). The TSP1 domain contributes to the protein's interaction with the extracellular matrix, while the CT domain is involved in dimerization and heparin binding (Krupska2015Eyeing).

CCN4 undergoes post-translational modifications such as N-glycosylation, which may influence its function (Singh2024An). The protein can also be subject to proteolytic cleavage, particularly in the linker region between domains 2 and 3, which affects its biological activity (Holbourn2009Proteins). Alternative splicing of CCN4 mRNA can result in truncated protein variants with potentially distinct functions (Singh2024An).

## Function
CCN4, also known as WISP1, is a matricellular protein that plays a significant role in various biological processes in healthy human cells. It is particularly involved in wound healing and tissue repair, where it is upregulated following cutaneous wounding. CCN4 facilitates wound healing by promoting the proliferation and migration of dermal fibroblasts through its interaction with integrin α5β1 and cell surface proteoglycans like decorin and biglycan. This interaction activates signaling pathways such as ERK and JNK, which are essential for cell proliferation (Singh2024An).

In the context of bone biology, CCN4 is involved in osteogenesis by enhancing the activity of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2). It binds directly to BMP-2, increasing its binding to human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) and enhancing BMP-2-induced osteogenic differentiation. This process involves the phosphorylation of Smad-1/5/8, which activates BMP-2-responsive gene transcription, promoting bone formation (Ono2010WISP1CCN4). CCN4's interaction with integrin α5β1 is crucial for BMP-2-induced osteogenesis, highlighting its role in bone health and development (Ono2010WISP1CCN4).

## Clinical Significance
CCN4, also known as WISP1, is implicated in various cancers, including lower-grade glioma (LGG), melanoma, and colorectal cancer. In LGG, increased expression of CCN4 is associated with shorter survival and is considered a poor prognostic marker. It is linked to aggressive molecular subtypes, such as IDH wild-type and TERT promoter mutations, indicating its potential role in glioma progression (Liu2022Stromal).

In melanoma, WISP1 expression is elevated in primary tumors compared to benign skin conditions. High levels of WISP1 are associated with reduced overall survival, suggesting its role as a biomarker for poor prognosis. WISP1 promotes melanoma invasion and metastasis by facilitating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process crucial for cancer metastasis (Deng2019WNT1inducible).

In colorectal cancer, WISP1 is involved in oncogenesis and is regulated by RNF180 through ubiquitination. RNF180 downregulates WISP1, suppressing tumor growth, highlighting WISP1's oncogenic role in colorectal cancer (Wei2021RNF180).

CCN4 is also implicated in neurofibromatosis type 1 tumorigenesis, with its expression varying between different tumor types and cell lines, suggesting a complex role in disease progression (Pasmant2010Differential).

## Interactions
CCN4, also known as WISP1, is a member of the CCN family of proteins and is involved in various physical interactions with other proteins. It interacts with integrins such as αVβ1, αVβ3, αVβ5, α4β1, α5β1, and α6β1, which are significant in mediating cellular processes like proliferation, migration, and invasion, particularly in cancer and fibrosis (Singh2024An). CCN4 also binds to small leucine-rich proteoglycans, including decorin and biglycan, which are components of the extracellular matrix (Singh2024An).

In the context of osteogenesis, CCN4 enhances the activity of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) by binding directly to it and increasing its binding to bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) in a dose-dependent manner. This interaction is facilitated through integrin α5β1, which is crucial for BMP-2-induced osteogenesis (Ono2010WISP1CCN4).

CCN4 also interacts with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), leading to its proteasome-dependent degradation, thereby inhibiting adipocyte differentiation (Ferrand2017WISP1CCN4). These interactions highlight CCN4's role in modulating various cellular pathways and its potential impact on disease pathologies.
