# IVL

## Overview
The IVL gene encodes involucrin, a structural protein that plays a pivotal role in the formation of the cornified cell envelope (CE) in stratified squamous epithelia, particularly within the epidermis. Involucrin is categorized as a scaffold protein, essential for the skin's barrier function. It is primarily expressed in the upper layers of the epidermis, where it undergoes cross-linking by transglutaminase enzymes, facilitating the assembly of a robust protein-lipid complex that contributes to the skin's protective barrier. The gene is part of the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) on chromosome 1q21.3, which is crucial for epidermal differentiation and function. Involucrin's expression is modulated by various cytokines and pathways, including the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), which enhances its role in maintaining skin integrity (Furue2020Regulation).

## Structure
Involucrin is a structural protein involved in the formation of the cornified cell envelope (CE) in stratified squamous epithelia. Its primary structure consists of a central domain with 39 tandem repeats of ten amino acids, flanked by a 147 amino acid head segment and a 41 amino acid tail segment (Kalinin2002Epithelial). The central segment repeat units have a consensus sequence of QEGQLKHLEQ, with each repeat containing three glutamine residues that serve as amine acceptors in transglutaminase-catalyzed cross-linking (Lambert2000Transglutaminase).

In terms of secondary structure, involucrin predominantly adopts an α-helical conformation, with short segments of 3_10-helix, which allows for the appropriate arrangement of glutamate side chains for lipid attachment (Lazo1999A). The protein is described as a rod-shaped molecule with 50-75% α-helical content (Lazo1999A).

Involucrin undergoes post-translational modifications, including cross-linking by transglutaminase enzymes, which is crucial for its role in the structural assembly of the CE. Specific glutamine and lysine residues are involved in these cross-linking processes, contributing to the protein's function as a scaffold for the attachment of lipids and other proteins (Steinert1997Direct).

## Function
Involucrin (IVL) is a protein that plays a crucial role in the formation of the cornified envelope, a key component of the skin's barrier function. In healthy human cells, IVL is expressed in the upper spinous and granular layers of the epidermis, where it is involved in the initial steps of cornified envelope formation. This process begins at desmosomes, where IVL is crosslinked with other proteins such as envoplakin, periplakin, and keratin filaments by the enzyme transglutaminase 1. This protein complex acts as a scaffold for the corneocyte-bound lipid envelope, contributing to the structural integrity and protective function of the skin (Furue2020Regulation).

IVL is part of the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) located on chromosome 1q21.3, which is essential for the differentiation and function of the epidermis (Furue2020Regulation). The protein is involved in keratinocyte terminal differentiation, indicating its role in the formation of the skin barrier (Furue2020Regulation). IVL's expression is regulated by various cytokines and pathways, including the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), which can upregulate its expression, enhancing skin barrier function (Furue2020Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the IVL gene, which encodes involucrin, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD), a common inflammatory skin disease. Variants in the 923 enhancer region, which regulates IVL expression, have been associated with decreased IVL expression in AD patients. These expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) are enriched in individuals with AD, suggesting that they may act as modifiers of the skin barrier, potentially exacerbating the condition when combined with filaggrin loss-of-function variants (Mathyer2019An). 

The 923 enhancer's role in regulating IVL expression is also linked to evolutionary adaptations in skin barrier function. Population-specific variations in this enhancer have been observed, with certain haplotypes showing increased IVL expression, which may have provided an evolutionary advantage in adapting to different environmental conditions, such as those requiring enhanced vitamin D production (Mathyer2019An; Mathyer2021Selective). 

These findings underscore the clinical significance of IVL expression levels and enhancer variants in skin barrier-related conditions, highlighting the potential for these genetic factors to influence the severity and penetrance of diseases like atopic dermatitis (Mathyer2019An; Mathyer2021Selective).

## Interactions
Involucrin (IVL) is a key protein involved in the formation of the cornified envelope in the epidermis. It participates in several critical interactions with other proteins, primarily through the action of transglutaminase 1. This enzyme cross-links IVL with proteins such as envoplakin, periplakin, and keratin filaments, forming a scaffold that is essential for the structural integrity of the skin barrier (Furue2020Regulation). IVL also shares high structural homology with loricrin (LOR), another major component of the cornified envelope, and is similarly cross-linked to the protein scaffolds by transglutaminase 1, reinforcing the skin's protective barrier (Furue2020Regulation).

In the context of skin diseases, IVL expression is altered in conditions such as verrucous epidermal naevi (VEN), where it is upregulated along with other proteins like loricrin and filaggrin. These proteins are involved in cornification and epidermal cell differentiation, processes crucial for maintaining the skin's barrier function (Yuan2021Differentially). The interactions of IVL with these proteins are significant in the pathogenesis of VEN and other skin barrier-related conditions (Yuan2021Differentially).
