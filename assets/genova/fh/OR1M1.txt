# OR1M1

## Overview
The OR1M1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 1 subfamily M member 1, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein is integral to the olfactory system, functioning as a receptor that detects and transduces odorant signals in the olfactory epithelium. As a transmembrane receptor, it plays a pivotal role in the initial steps of olfactory signal transduction by binding specific odor molecules and activating intracellular G proteins, which subsequently trigger a cascade of events leading to the perception of smell (Sharma2019Sense; Hasin-Brumshtein2009Human). The OR1M1 gene is part of a complex genomic cluster of olfactory receptor genes, and its genetic variability contributes to the diversity of olfactory perception among individuals (Keller2007Genetic; Hasin2008High-Resolution).

## Function
The OR1M1 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in the sense of smell. These receptors are located in the olfactory epithelium, where they detect volatile odorants. Upon binding to specific odor molecules, OR1M1 initiates a signal transduction pathway that involves the activation of G proteins, leading to the production of cyclic AMP (cAMP). This cascade ultimately results in the depolarization of olfactory sensory neurons and the generation of action potentials, which are transmitted to the brain for odor perception (Sharma2019Sense; Hasin-Brumshtein2009Human).

The OR1M1 gene is part of a larger cluster of olfactory receptor genes, which includes OR7D4 and others, and is subject to genetic variations such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that can affect odor perception (Keller2007Genetic). The variability in OR1M1 and other olfactory receptor genes contributes to the diversity of olfactory capabilities among individuals, influencing how different odors are perceived (Hasin2008High-Resolution). The expression of OR1M1 follows the 'one neuron-one receptor' rule, ensuring that each olfactory sensory neuron expresses only one type of olfactory receptor, which is essential for accurate odor coding (Yoshihito2012Olfactory).
