# HRNR

## Overview
The HRNR gene encodes the protein hornerin, which is a member of the S100 fused-type protein family and plays a critical role in skin biology. Hornerin is primarily involved in the formation and maintenance of the epidermal barrier, contributing to the structural integrity and mechanical resistance of the skin. It is a component of the cornified envelope in the epidermis and is involved in keratinocyte differentiation and the production of natural moisturizing factors, which are essential for skin hydration and elasticity. Hornerin also exhibits antimicrobial properties, with its fragments acting against various pathogens, including bacteria and fungi. Beyond its role in skin health, HRNR is implicated in tumor biology, where it influences tumor vascularity and interacts with tumor suppressors, suggesting a multifaceted role in both antimicrobial defense and cancer progression (Gutknecht2017Identification; Henry2012Update; Gerstel2018Hornerin).

## Structure
Hornerin (HRNR) is a protein with a theoretical molecular weight of 280 kDa in humans, characterized by a complex structure derived from evolutionary processes. The protein consists of six groups of three segments, each segment divided into four repeats of 39 amino acids (Kypriotou2012The). HRNR is part of the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) located on human chromosome 1q21, which includes three gene families: late cornified envelope precursors, small proline-rich proteins, and calcium-binding S100A (Garreis2017Expression). The protein structure includes two EF-hand calcium-binding domains in the N-terminal region, which are typical of the S100 fused-type protein family (Garreis2017Expression).

HRNR is known to form high molecular weight multimeric fragment complexes in the stratum granulosum and stratum corneum of the epidermis, contributing to the cornified envelope and exhibiting antimicrobial and protective functions (Garreis2017Expression). It is crosslinked by transglutaminase 3 (TG3) in vitro, forming high molecular weight oligomers that are proteolytically processed during differentiation (Kypriotou2012The). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and has multiple splice variants, contributing to its functional diversity.

## Function
Hornerin (HRNR) is a protein encoded by the HRNR gene, primarily involved in the formation and maintenance of the epidermal barrier. It is a component of the cornified envelope (CE) in the epidermis, contributing to the structural integrity and mechanical resistance of the skin barrier (Rahrig2019Transient; Henry2012Update). Hornerin is synthesized as a large precursor and undergoes proteolytic processing during keratinocyte differentiation, becoming part of the cornified envelope (Henry2012Update). 

In healthy human cells, hornerin plays a crucial role in keratinocyte differentiation and the transformation into corneocytes, which are essential for the formation of the skin's outermost layer (Garreis2017Expression). It is involved in the production of natural moisturizing factors (NMFs) in the stratum corneum, which are vital for maintaining skin hydration, elasticity, and pH balance (Rahrig2019Transient). 

Hornerin also exhibits antimicrobial properties, with its fragments being active against various pathogens, including bacteria and fungi. This antimicrobial activity is attributed to its cationic intrinsically disordered antimicrobial peptides (CIDAMPs), which disrupt bacterial membranes and interfere with protein synthesis (Gerstel2018Hornerin). These functions highlight hornerin's role in both structural and immune defense mechanisms in the skin.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the HRNR gene, which encodes the protein hornerin, have been implicated in several diseases. In the context of atopic eczema, genetic variants such as HRNR rs877776[C] have been identified as risk factors. This variant is associated with an increased susceptibility to atopic eczema, allergic sensitization, and eczema-associated asthma in children. The presence of the C allele of rs877776 significantly increases the risk of developing these conditions, suggesting that HRNR plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of atopic eczema by affecting skin barrier function (Dębińska2022Genetic).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), HRNR expression is linked to poor prognosis. High levels of HRNR are associated with worse disease-free survival and overall survival rates. HRNR promotes tumor progression by enhancing cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, likely through the activation of the AKT signaling pathway. This makes HRNR a potential target for therapeutic intervention in HCC (Fu2018Hornerin).

HRNR mutations have also been observed in non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and other cancers, indicating a broader role in cancer pathogenesis. However, the specific mechanisms by which HRNR mutations contribute to these cancers remain to be fully elucidated (Singh2023Identification).

## Interactions
Hornerin (HRNR) interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in both antimicrobial activity and tumor biology. HRNR-derived cationic intrinsically disordered antimicrobial peptides (CIDAMPs) bind to bacterial ribosomal proteins, including those in the 30S and 50S subunits of Escherichia coli. Specific ribosomal proteins such as L2, L22, and L28 are involved in these interactions, which can disrupt ribosome assembly and function, leading to the synthesis of aberrant proteins and potentially toxic aggregates (Gerstel2018Hornerin). 

In the context of tumor biology, HRNR is implicated in regulating tumor vascularity. It is upregulated in response to non-VEGF soluble factors in tumor-conditioned media, suggesting interactions with signaling pathways independent of VEGF. This regulation is particularly noted in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, where HRNR expression is significantly increased in tumor vessels compared to normal pancreatic endothelial cells (Gutknecht2017Identification). 

HRNR also interacts with PinX1, a tumor suppressor involved in telomerase activity and chromosome integrity, indicating its potential role in apoptosis and necrosis in breast cancer cells (Fleming2012Hornerin). These interactions highlight HRNR's multifaceted role in both antimicrobial defense and cancer progression.
