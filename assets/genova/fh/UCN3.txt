# UCN3

## Overview
Urocortin 3 (UCN3) is a gene that encodes the peptide hormone urocortin 3, which is part of the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) family. This hormone is primarily involved in the regulation of insulin secretion and glucose metabolism, acting as a local regulator in pancreatic beta cells. Urocortin 3 functions through its interaction with the corticotropin-releasing factor receptor type 2 (CRFR2), distinguishing it as a selective agonist for this receptor (Li2007Urocortin; Fekete2007Physiology). The protein plays a significant role in energy homeostasis and stress modulation, with expression in both central and peripheral tissues, including specific brain regions and pancreatic cells (Lewis2001Identification; van2012Urocortin). Urocortin 3's involvement in metabolic processes and its potential implications in conditions such as type 2 diabetes and certain cancers highlight its clinical significance (Kavalakatt2019Urocortin; Faraj2019CancerSpecific).

## Structure


## Function
Urocortin 3 (UCN3) is a peptide hormone that plays a significant role in the regulation of insulin secretion and glucose metabolism in human cells. It is primarily expressed in pancreatic beta cells, where it acts as a local regulator of insulin secretion in response to high glucose levels. UCN3 functions through the corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 2 (CRFR2), amplifying glucose-induced insulin release, similar to other amplifiers like GLP-1 (Li2007Urocortin; van2012Urocortin). 

In humans, UCN3 is expressed in both alpha and beta cells of the pancreas, marking it as a maturation marker for these cells. Its expression is associated with the maturation of beta cells, indicated by the co-expression with insulin and other markers of mature beta cells such as Pdx1 and Nkx6.1 (van2012Urocortin). 

UCN3's role extends to influencing energy homeostasis, as it is involved in modulating insulin secretion under conditions of nutrient excess. This regulation is crucial for maintaining glucose homeostasis and preventing metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance and glucose intolerance (Li2007Urocortin; Fekete2007Physiology).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the UCN3 gene have been linked to several metabolic and cancer-related conditions. In the context of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D), UCN3 expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) is increased in overweight individuals but decreases with physical exercise and inflammation. Plasma UCN3 levels decrease with higher body mass index (BMI) and are associated with glycemic indices, showing different patterns in overweight individuals with and without T2D (Kavalakatt2019Urocortin). UCN3 is also implicated in glucose homeostasis and insulin regulation, with its expression in pancreatic β-cells being reduced in T2D patients (Kavalakatt2019Urocortin).

In cancer, UCN3 is significantly downregulated in kidney cancer, particularly in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC). This downregulation is associated with the hypervascular nature of ccRCC and excessive expression of VEGF, suggesting a role in inhibiting neovascularization through CRHR2 activation. UCN3's lower levels in urine or blood serum compared to physiological levels may serve as a potential biomarker for early diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma (Faraj2019CancerSpecific).

In transgenic mouse models, overexpression of UCN3 results in a metabolically favorable phenotype, including increased skeletal muscle mass and resistance to obesity and hyperglycemia, indicating its potential protective role against metabolic disorders (Jamieson2011Urocortin).

## Interactions
Urocortin 3 (UCN3) is a selective agonist for the corticotropin-releasing factor receptor type 2 (CRF2R), with high affinity and specificity for this receptor. UCN3 does not significantly interact with the CRF receptor type 1 (CRF1R) or the corticotropin-releasing hormone-binding protein (CRHBP) in humans, rats, or frogs, highlighting its selectivity for CRF2R (Lewis2001Identification; Fekete2007Physiology). The interaction between UCN3 and CRF2R is primarily mediated by the extracellular domain of the receptor, which is crucial for its binding specificity (Fekete2007Physiology).

UCN3 is involved in modulating stress-related autonomic, neuroendocrine, and behavioral functions through its interaction with CRF2R. It is expressed in specific brain regions and peripheral tissues, suggesting roles in stress modulation and energy homeostasis (Lewis2001Identification; Chen2013Central). UCN3's binding to CRF2R is characterized by a helix-loop-helix structure, which is essential for receptor interactions (Squillacioti2019Urocortins). This interaction is significant in the context of the central auditory system, where UCN3 is expressed in principal neurons, potentially modulating multimodal cells via volume transmission (Pagella2021Expression).
