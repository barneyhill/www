# ZNF891

## Overview
ZNF891 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 891, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are small protein structural motifs that can coordinate one or more zinc ions to help stabilize their folds. Zinc finger proteins are often involved in DNA binding and play critical roles in transcriptional regulation, cellular development, and differentiation. The specific functions and interactions of zinc finger protein 891 remain to be fully elucidated, but like other zinc finger proteins, it is likely involved in regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. Understanding the role of ZNF891 and its encoded protein could provide insights into various biological processes and potential implications in human health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
