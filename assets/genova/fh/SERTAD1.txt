# SERTAD1

## Overview
SERTAD1, or SERTA domain containing 1, is a gene that encodes a nuclear protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in cell cycle regulation and transcriptional activities. The protein encoded by SERTAD1 is a member of the SERTAD/TRIP-Br nuclear factor family and plays a crucial role in modulating E2F-dependent transcriptional activities, interacting with key cell cycle regulators such as E2F1/DP-1 and CDK4/p16INK4a (Mongre2019Prognostic). It is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it influences cell growth and survival through interactions with proteins like XIAP and ASK1, and participates in ubiquitination processes (Mongre2019Prognostic). SERTAD1's involvement in these pathways underscores its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Nguyen2022SERTAD1; Ambareen2024Sertad1).

## Function
SERTAD1, a member of the SERTAD/TRIP-Br nuclear factor family, plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in cell cycle regulation and transcriptional activities. In healthy human cells, SERTAD1 is involved in modulating E2F-dependent transcriptional activities and interacts with several cell cycle regulators, such as E2F1/DP-1 and CDK4/p16INK4a (Mongre2019Prognostic). It is localized within the nucleus, where it influences cell growth and survival through interactions with proteins like XIAP and ASK1, and participates in ubiquitination processes (Mongre2019Prognostic).

SERTAD1 acts as a growth factor sensor in the cell survival program by negatively regulating the E2F transcription factor through the activation of p16 INK4a. This regulation is crucial during the G1/S phase of the cell cycle, helping to maintain cellular homeostasis (Mongre2019Prognostic). The normal expression of SERTAD1 can be influenced by factors such as physical stress or nutrient availability, and its aberrant expression can lead to programmed cell death (Mongre2019Prognostic). In summary, SERTAD1's primary function in healthy cells is associated with its regulatory roles in cell cycle modulation and maintaining cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and interactions of the SERTAD1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, including various cancers and Alzheimer's disease. In ovarian cancer, SERTAD1 is identified as an oncoprotein that interacts with USP15, a deubiquitinating enzyme. This interaction stabilizes SERTAD1, leading to its accumulation and promoting chromosomal instability, which contributes to tumorigenesis (Yaginuma2023Identification). SERTAD1 also plays a role in breast cancer, where its expression influences sensitivity to the chemotherapy drug doxorubicin. Knockdown of SERTAD1 in breast cancer cells increases their sensitivity to the drug, suggesting that SERTAD1 may confer resistance to chemotherapy (Nguyen2022SERTAD1).

In leukemia, SERTAD1 interacts with iASPP, a protein that inhibits the tumor suppressor p53. SERTAD1 antagonizes iASPP by preventing its nuclear entry, thereby potentially restoring p53 function and increasing susceptibility to chemotherapy (Qiu2017Sertad1). In Alzheimer's disease, elevated levels of SERTAD1 are associated with synaptic loss, neuron death, and cognitive impairment. Knockdown of SERTAD1 in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease has been shown to ameliorate cognitive deficits and restore synaptic function, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Ambareen2024Sertad1).

## Interactions
SERTAD1 interacts with various proteins, playing significant roles in cellular processes. It is known to bind and activate cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (Cdk4), facilitating the formation and activation of cyclin D-Cdk4 complexes, which are crucial for cell cycle progression and neuronal apoptosis (Biswas2010Sertad1). SERTAD1 also interacts with the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), stabilizing it in cancer cells, which suggests a role in antiapoptotic activity (Biswas2010Sertad1).

In leukemic cells, SERTAD1 interacts with the protein iASPP, antagonizing its function by preventing its nuclear entry and reducing its interaction with the tumor suppressor protein p53. This interaction affects cell proliferation and apoptosis, suggesting a regulatory role in leukemia pathogenesis (Qiu2017Sertad1).

SERTAD1 is also identified as a novel interacting protein with USP15, a deubiquitinating enzyme. This interaction stabilizes SERTAD1 by inhibiting its degradation, contributing to chromosomal instability in ovarian cancer cells (Yaginuma2023Identification). These interactions highlight SERTAD1's involvement in various cellular pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target in different diseases.
