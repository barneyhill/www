# LHFPL5

## Overview
LHFPL5 is a gene that encodes the LHFPL tetraspan subfamily member 5 protein, a critical component of the mechano-electrical transduction (MET) channel complex in the inner ear's hair cells. This transmembrane protein, also known as TMHS, is part of the tetraspan superfamily, which includes proteins involved in cellular junctions and ion channel regulation. LHFPL5 is characterized by four transmembrane segments and is essential for the proper localization and function of the MET channel, interacting with other key proteins such as PCDH15 and TMC1. These interactions are vital for hearing and balance, as they facilitate the MET channel's assembly and function at the stereocilia tips of hair cells. Mutations in the LHFPL5 gene can lead to autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss, highlighting its clinical significance in auditory function (Soler2023Multiple; Kalay2006Mutations; Yu2020Deafness).

## Structure
The LHFPL5 protein, encoded by the LHFPL5 gene, is a membrane protein with a molecular weight of approximately 24 kDa. It is characterized by four transmembrane segments, which contribute to its role in protein trafficking to the plasma membrane (Cunningham2018Molecular; Soler2023Multiple). The protein structure includes intracellular N-and C-terminal domains, two extracellular loops (ECL1 and ECL2), and one short intracellular loop (ICL) (Soler2023Multiple). 

The extracellular loop 1 (ECL1), encompassing amino acid residues 47-96, is particularly significant as it prevents detectable plasma membrane localization, suggesting a role in intracellular retention (Soler2023Multiple). LHFPL5 is part of the tetraspan junctional complex superfamily and shares structural similarities with claudin proteins, including conserved cysteine residues and a Glycine-Leucine-Tryptophan (GLW) sequence, which are important for protein folding and function (Cunningham2018Molecular; Soler2023Multiple).

In terms of quaternary structure, LHFPL5 forms a complex with PCDH15, a component of the mechanotransduction (MET) channel in hair cells. This interaction is crucial for the assembly and function of the MET channel complex (Ge2018Structure).

## Function
The LHFPL5 gene encodes a transmembrane protein that is a critical component of the mechano-electrical transduction (MET) channel complex in hair cells of the inner ear, essential for hearing and balance. This protein, also known as TMHS, is necessary for the proper function and localization of the MET channel to the stereocilia tips in hair cells, where it interacts with other MET channel proteins such as PCDH15, TMIE, and TMC1 (Soler2023Multiple; Yu2020Deafness). LHFPL5 stabilizes TMC1 expression, which is crucial for maintaining the structure and function of hair cells, as evidenced by the destabilization of TMC1 in the absence of LHFPL5 (Yu2020Deafness).

LHFPL5 is a four-transmembrane segment protein from the tetraspan superfamily, which includes proteins involved in tight junctions, gap junctions, and ion channel regulation. It is expressed in the apical hair cell membrane and stereocilia, with peak expression during the formation of stereocilia and acquisition of MET function (Soler2023Multiple). The protein's proper function is dependent on its interaction with PCDH15, and mutations in LHFPL5 can lead to congenital hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction (Soler2023Multiple; Kalay2006Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LHFPL5 gene are associated with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss, specifically classified as DFNB67. These mutations can lead to severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss, often detected within the first six months of life. The inheritance pattern is typically autosomal recessive, frequently observed in consanguineous families (Kalay2006Mutations). Specific mutations identified include c.649delG, which causes a frameshift and an extended C-terminal part of the protein, and c.494C>T, resulting in the amino acid substitution p.Thr165Met. These mutations have been found in affected families from various regions, including Turkey and the Czech Republic (Kalay2006Mutations; Marková2016Mutations).

The LHFPL5 gene is crucial for the proper function of the mechano-electrical transduction (MET) channels in inner ear hair cells. Disruptions in LHFPL5 can impair auditory and vestibular function, leading to hearing loss and balance issues (Soler2023Multiple). Alterations in LHFPL5 expression or its interaction with other proteins, such as TMC1, can destabilize these proteins, further contributing to auditory dysfunction (Yu2020Deafness). The gene's role in hearing underscores its clinical significance, as mutations can lead to significant auditory impairments.

## Interactions
LHFPL5, also known as TMHS, is a protein that plays a crucial role in the mechanotransduction complex of inner ear hair cells. It interacts with several key proteins involved in hearing. LHFPL5 forms a complex with protocadherin 15 (PCDH15), which is essential for the proper localization and function of the mechanotransduction (MET) channel. This interaction is necessary for LHFPL5 to localize to the plasma membrane and stereocilia tips, the site of MET channels (Ge2018Structure; Soler2023Multiple). 

LHFPL5 also interacts with transmembrane channel-like protein 1 (TMC1). Although initial studies did not detect a direct interaction, more sensitive assays have demonstrated that LHFPL5 stabilizes TMC1, and this interaction is crucial for TMC1's stability and function in hair cells. Mutations in TMC1, such as D572N, disrupt this interaction, leading to destabilization of TMC1 and associated hearing loss (Liu2021Mechanisms; Yu2020Deafness). 

LHFPL5 does not directly interact with TMC1 but may stabilize the interaction between PCDH15 and TMC1, indicating its role in the assembly and function of the MET complex (Soler2023Multiple).
