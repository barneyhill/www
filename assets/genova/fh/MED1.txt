# MED1

## Overview
MED1 is a gene that encodes the protein mediator complex subunit 1, a critical component of the Mediator complex involved in transcriptional regulation. The Mediator complex serves as a bridge between gene-specific transcription factors and the RNA polymerase II machinery, facilitating the transcription of various genes. MED1, also known by several aliases such as PBP, PPARBP, and TRAP220, is characterized by its modular structure, including LXXLL motifs that enable interactions with nuclear receptors and transcription factors. These interactions are crucial for the regulation of metabolic functions, cellular proliferation, and differentiation (Chen2011Mediatordependent; Jia2014Med1). MED1 is involved in chromatin remodeling and transcription initiation, playing a significant role in processes such as liver regeneration and energy homeostasis (Jia2014Med1). Additionally, MED1's expression and function have clinical significance, as alterations in its expression are associated with various cancers, including breast, bladder, and colorectal cancer, where it influences tumor progression and patient prognosis (Nagpal2018Essential; Howard2009Epigenetic; Klümper2017Mediator).

## Structure
The human MED1 protein, a component of the mediator complex, exhibits a modular structure with distinct domains contributing to its function. The N-terminal portion of MED1 is involved in interactions with other subunits within the mediator complex, forming extensive contacts with MED24 in the Tail module (Zhao2021Structure). This region is characterized by alternating α-helical and β-sheet domains, contributing to its tertiary organization (Zhao2021Structure). The N-terminal domain of MED1 also contains LXXLL motifs, which are targeted by nuclear receptors and are located outside the folded portion of the subunit (Zhao2021Structure).

The protein includes intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), which are important for interactions with transcription factors (Zhao2021Structure). These IDRs contribute to the flexibility and conformational changes of the mediator complex. MED1 is known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its interaction with other proteins and its role in transcription regulation (Zhao2021Structure).

MED1 exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, which contribute to its functional diversity. These isoforms may have different roles in transcription regulation, depending on their specific domain compositions and interactions within the mediator complex (Zhao2021Structure).

## Function
MED1, also known as PBP/PPARBP/TRAP220/DRIP205/RB18A, is a critical component of the mammalian Mediator complex, which serves as a bridge between gene-specific transcription factors and the RNA polymerase II machinery. It contains two LXXLL motifs essential for binding various cofactors, including SRC family members, PGC-1 family members, p300/CBP, and RIP140, facilitating interactions with several transcription factors and cofactors such as PRIP, PIMT, C/EBPb, SRC, GATA family members, CBP/P300, PGC-1, and tumor-suppressor P53. This indicates its significant role in nuclear receptor-regulated metabolic functions, cellular proliferation, and differentiation (Jia2014Med1).

MED1 is crucial for nuclear receptor (NR) functions, facilitating strong interactions with NRs in a ligand-dependent manner. These interactions are mediated by the LXXLL motifs of MED1 and the AF2 domain of NRs, essential for maximal NR-dependent transcription (Chen2011Mediatordependent). MED1 is involved in chromatin remodeling and transcription initiation, interacting with PGC-1α to facilitate the transition between chromatin remodeling and transcription (Chen2011Mediatordependent).

In the liver, MED1 is essential for signaling of nuclear receptors such as PPARα, CAR, FXR, LXR, PXR, and GR, which regulate energy homeostasis, bile acid formation, and detoxification processes. MED1 is necessary for liver regeneration and is sufficient to induce hepatocellular proliferation (Jia2014Med1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MED1 gene, a subunit of the Mediator complex, have been implicated in various cancers. In bladder cancer, MED1 expression decreases significantly as the disease progresses from non-muscle invasive to muscle-invasive stages. Low MED1 expression in primary tumors is associated with positive lymph node status and reduced overall survival, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in bladder cancer management (Klümper2017Mediator).

In breast cancer, MED1 is often overexpressed, particularly in estrogen receptor-positive patients, and is linked to poor prognosis. MED1 enhances the transcriptional regulation of estrogen receptor-dependent oncogenic microRNAs, promoting cancer cell proliferation and migration. Its overexpression correlates with poor outcomes, and MED1 knockdown increases sensitivity to anti-estrogen treatments (Nagpal2018Essential).

In colorectal cancer, MED1 is epigenetically downregulated through promoter methylation, which is an early event in tumorigenesis. This methylation is more prevalent in cancer patients compared to controls, indicating its role in tumor initiation. MED1 suppression is associated with genomic instability and cancer development (Howard2009Epigenetic).

MED1 also plays a role in DNA repair processes, interacting with BRCA1 to regulate homologous recombination and R-loop processing. Its dysregulation can lead to impaired DNA repair and increased genomic instability, contributing to cancer progression (Honjoh2022MED1).

## Interactions
MED1, a subunit of the Mediator complex, is involved in numerous interactions with various transcription factors and nuclear receptors, playing a crucial role in transcriptional regulation. MED1 interacts with nuclear hormone receptors such as the thyroid hormone receptor (TR), vitamin D receptor (VDR), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARα), retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRα), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), and estrogen receptor (ER) (Lewis2003The; Borggrefe2011Interactions). These interactions are facilitated by nuclear receptor recognition motifs, specifically the LxxLL motifs of MED1, which are essential for both physical interaction and transcriptional activation (Borggrefe2011Interactions).

MED1 also interacts with transcription factors such as GATA-1, C/EBPβ, and p53, serving as a coactivator in various biological processes, including erythropoiesis and adipogenesis (Borggrefe2011Interactions). The interaction with C/EBPβ is enhanced by IFNγ stimulation, which affects the expression of C/EBPβ target genes (Borggrefe2011Interactions). MED1's interaction with GR involves cooperation with MED14, enhancing GR transactivation activity, although mutations in the LxxLL motif can disrupt this interaction (Borggrefe2011Interactions).

Within the Mediator complex, MED1 is part of the Middle module and interacts with other subunits such as MED4, MED7, MED9, MED10, MED21, and MED31, forming a conserved interaction network (Tsai2014Subunit). These interactions highlight MED1's role as an interface for diverse transcriptional regulators, facilitating gene-specific transcriptional activation.
