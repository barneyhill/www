# PCNA

## Overview
PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) is a gene that encodes a crucial protein involved in DNA replication and repair processes in eukaryotic cells. The protein, also referred to as PCNA, functions as a DNA sliding clamp, forming a homotrimeric ring that encircles DNA to enhance the processivity of DNA polymerases. This structural feature allows PCNA to stabilize the interaction between DNA polymerases and the DNA template, facilitating the synthesis of long DNA strands. Beyond its role in replication, PCNA is integral to various DNA repair mechanisms, including nucleotide excision repair, base excision repair, and mismatch repair, by interacting with a multitude of proteins essential for DNA processing. Additionally, PCNA is involved in cell cycle regulation and maintaining genomic stability, acting as a central hub for coordinating DNA metabolism through its interactions with proteins containing specific motifs. The gene's mutations are linked to several DNA repair disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in genomic integrity and disease states such as cancer (Baple2014Hypomorphic; Tsurimoto1998PCNA).

## Structure
The proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is a homotrimeric protein that forms a ring-shaped structure, encircling DNA to function as a sliding clamp during DNA replication and repair. Each PCNA monomer consists of two globular domains connected by an interdomain connecting loop (IDCL), contributing to the protein's pseudo-six-fold symmetry. The outer surface of the PCNA ring is composed of six β-sheets, while the inner surface contains twelve α-helices, which are positively charged to facilitate interaction with the DNA duplex (GonzálezMagaña2020Human; Bellí2022Post-Translational).

PCNA's structure includes specific domains for protein interactions, such as the hydrophobic pocket in the IDCL region, which accommodates motifs like the PCNA-interacting peptide (PIP) box and the AlkB homologue 2 PCNA interacting motif (APIM) (Bellí2022Post-Translational). The protein is subject to various post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination and sumoylation at lysine residues K164 and K127, which are crucial for DNA damage tolerance (Bellí2022Post-Translational). Phosphorylation at residues Y114 and Y211 stabilizes the protein and affects its interaction with mismatch repair proteins (Bellí2022Post-Translational). These structural features and modifications enable PCNA to serve as a central hub for coordinating DNA replication and repair processes.

## Function
PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) is a critical protein in DNA replication and repair processes in eukaryotic cells. It functions as a DNA sliding clamp, forming a homotrimeric ring that encircles DNA, thereby enhancing the processivity of DNA polymerases during replication. This structure allows PCNA to facilitate the synthesis of long DNA strands by stabilizing the interaction between DNA polymerases and the DNA template (Tsurimoto1998PCNA).

PCNA is involved in several DNA repair mechanisms, including nucleotide excision repair, base excision repair, and mismatch repair. It interacts with various proteins such as RFC, FEN1, and DNA ligase I, which are essential for processing DNA during repair (Tsurimoto1998PCNA). PCNA also plays a role in cell cycle regulation by interacting with proteins like p21, which can inhibit DNA replication without affecting repair processes (Tsurimoto1998PCNA; Paunesku2001Proliferating).

In addition to its role in replication and repair, PCNA is involved in maintaining genomic stability and proper gene regulation through interactions with DNA methyltransferase and other proteins (Tsurimoto1998PCNA). Its activity is primarily localized in the nucleus, particularly during the S phase of the cell cycle, where it is crucial for cell proliferation and genomic integrity (Paunesku2001Proliferating).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PCNA gene are associated with several DNA repair disorders. The p.Ser228Ile variant is linked to a novel neurodegenerative disorder characterized by symptoms such as short stature, hearing loss, premature aging, telangiectasia, neurodegeneration, and photosensitivity. This mutation impairs PCNA's role in nucleotide excision repair (NER), particularly transcription-coupled NER (TC-NER), leading to increased cellular sensitivity to UV irradiation and reduced DNA repair capabilities (Baple2014Hypomorphic). Clinically, individuals with this mutation exhibit symptoms similar to Cockayne syndrome and xeroderma pigmentosum, though generally milder (Baple2014Hypomorphic).

Alterations in PCNA expression or mutations affecting its interactions can also lead to genomic instability. For instance, mutations at the Ser46-Leu47 residues disrupt PCNA's trimerization and interaction with essential DNA repair proteins, leading to increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents and defects in DNA repair processes (Kim2023PCNA). These mutations can result in increased single-stranded DNA gaps and compromised genomic integrity, potentially contributing to disease states characterized by genomic instability, such as cancer (Kim2023PCNA).

## Interactions
PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) is a central hub in DNA metabolism, facilitating interactions with numerous proteins involved in DNA replication and repair. It forms a homotrimeric ring that encircles DNA, allowing it to interact with various proteins through its interdomain connecting loop (IDCL) and other contact sites (Mailand2013Regulation; Dieckman2012PCNA). 

PCNA interacts with proteins containing short linear motifs (SLiMs) such as the PCNA-interacting protein (PIP) box and the AlkB homologue PCNA interacting motif (APIM). These motifs enable proteins like p21, FEN1, and Y-family DNA polymerases to bind to PCNA, playing crucial roles in DNA replication and repair (Mailand2013Regulation; GonzálezMagaña2020Human). The PIP box is a common motif found in many proteins, allowing them to pack into the hydrophobic surface of PCNA, with p21 showing high binding efficiency (Mailand2013Regulation).

PCNA also forms multiprotein complexes, such as those involved in translesion synthesis, where it acts as a "tool belt" to coordinate the activity of different polymerases (Boehm2016PCNA). These interactions are regulated by post-translational modifications, which can alter the binding affinity of PCNA and its partners, ensuring proper DNA replication and response to DNA damage (Mailand2013Regulation).
