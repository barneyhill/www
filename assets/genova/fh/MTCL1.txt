# MTCL1

## Overview
MTCL1 (microtubule crosslinking factor 1) is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which plays a pivotal role in the organization and stabilization of microtubules within human cells. The MTCL1 protein is categorized as a microtubule-associated protein, characterized by its ability to crosslink and stabilize microtubules, thereby contributing to cellular integrity and function. It is particularly involved in the formation and maintenance of non-centrosomal microtubules, especially those associated with the Golgi apparatus, which are crucial for maintaining the Golgi ribbon structure and facilitating polarized cell migration (Sato2014MTCL1). MTCL1's interactions with various proteins, such as PAR-1b and CLASPs, underscore its role in microtubule dynamics and cellular processes, including epithelial polarity and intracellular transport (Sato2013A; Sato2014MTCL1). Mutations in the MTCL1 gene have been linked to neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in understanding diseases such as spinocerebellar ataxia (Satake2017MTCL1).

## Structure
MTCL1 (microtubule crosslinking factor 1) is a protein characterized by its ability to crosslink and stabilize microtubules. The protein contains two microtubule-binding domains (MTBDs) located at the N-terminal and C-terminal regions. The N-terminal MTBD is responsible for crosslinking microtubules, while the C-terminal MTBD stabilizes them (Kader2017Molecular). The central region of MTCL1 is rich in coiled-coil motifs, which facilitate the formation of parallel dimers through multiple homo-interactions, essential for its microtubule crosslinking activity (Kader2017Molecular; Sato2013A).

The N-terminal region includes a fragment with 241 amino acids (N4), sufficient for microtubule colocalization, and when extended to include two coiled-coil motifs (N1 fragment), it induces strong microtubule bundling (Sato2013A). The coiled-coil motifs likely form two-stranded structures, facilitating crosslinking (Sato2013A). The C-terminal region, rich in conserved lysine and arginine residues (KR-rich region), is crucial for microtubule stabilization and colocalization (Sato2013A; Sato2014MTCL1).

MTCL1 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its function. The protein also has multiple splice variants, affecting its structural and functional properties (Sato2013A).

## Function
MTCL1 (microtubule crosslinking factor 1) is a protein that plays a critical role in the organization and stabilization of microtubules in human cells. It is involved in the formation and maintenance of non-centrosomal microtubules, particularly those associated with the Golgi apparatus. MTCL1 is recruited to the Golgi membranes through interactions with proteins such as CLASPs and AKAP450/CG-NAP, which are involved in microtubule nucleation. This recruitment is essential for the formation of a stable perinuclear microtubule network, which is crucial for maintaining the Golgi ribbon structure necessary for polarized cell migration (Sato2014MTCL1).

MTCL1 has two microtubule-binding domains, with the N-terminal region facilitating microtubule accumulation and the C-terminal region providing microtubule-stabilizing activity. This dual functionality allows MTCL1 to crosslink and stabilize microtubules, contributing to cellular integrity and function (Kader2017Molecular). In epithelial cells, MTCL1 interacts with PAR-1b to organize microtubules, playing a role in epithelial polarity development by promoting the formation of apicobasal microtubule bundles (Sato2013A). MTCL1's activity is crucial for maintaining cell structure, facilitating intracellular transport, and ensuring proper cell division.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MTCL1 gene have been implicated in spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by symptoms such as imbalance, progressive gait and limb ataxia, and dysarthria. In a study involving 167 SCA patients, a mutation resulting in a valine to methionine change at position 1435 in the C-terminal microtubule-binding domain of MTCL1 was identified in two patients from one family. This variant was predicted to be pathogenic and was absent in a large database of normal exomes, suggesting its potential role in disease pathogenesis (Satake2017MTCL1).

Additionally, a novel homozygous loss of function variant in the MTCL1 gene, specifically a frameshift mutation (p.(Lys407fs)), was identified in a 23-year-old patient with progressive cerebellar ataxia, mild intellectual disability, childhood seizures, and episodic pain in the lower limbs. This mutation is predicted to truncate the MTCL1 protein, highlighting its potential role as a novel candidate gene for autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia (Krygier2019A).

Disruption of MTCL1 function leads to mislocalization of ankyrin-G, loss of axonal polarity, and Purkinje cell degeneration, which are associated with motor coordination deficits, underscoring its clinical significance in understanding and potentially treating spinocerebellar ataxia (Satake2017MTCL1).

## Interactions
MTCL1 (microtubule crosslinking factor 1) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a crucial role in microtubule organization and stabilization. It interacts with PAR-1b, a protein kinase, which is essential for MTCL1's function in epithelial cell polarization. This interaction is necessary for the development of lateral microtubule bundles, although MTCL1's microtubule-regulatory activity is not directly regulated by PAR-1b phosphorylation (Sato2013A).

MTCL1 also interacts with CLASPs (CLASP1 and CLASP2), which are key modulators of microtubule dynamics. These interactions are crucial for MTCL1's recruitment to the Golgi membrane, where it stabilizes non-centrosomal microtubules and contributes to Golgi ribbon formation (Sato2014MTCL1). Additionally, MTCL1 associates with the AKAP450/CG-NAP complex, further supporting its role in microtubule stabilization at the Golgi (Sato2014MTCL1).

MTCL1 is also associated with the regulatory subunit PPP2R5E of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which is necessary for MTCL1 stabilization. This interaction suggests a regulatory role of PPP2R5E in MTCL1's function (Hyodo2016A). These interactions highlight MTCL1's involvement in various cellular processes through its role in microtubule organization.
