# GOLM2

## Overview
GOLM2, also known as Golgi membrane protein 2, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein localized to the Golgi apparatus, an essential organelle involved in the modification, sorting, and transport of proteins. The GOLM2 protein plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and functional capacity of the Golgi apparatus, thereby influencing protein trafficking and secretion processes that are vital for cellular communication and homeostasis (Cahill2023Investigating). Although the specific functions of GOLM2 in normal physiological conditions are not fully detailed, its involvement in Golgi transport processes suggests a significant role in cellular logistics and protein handling. Additionally, GOLM2 has been associated with inflammation and immune pathways, indicating its potential impact on immune function and metabolic activities in disease contexts (Zhao2024Using; Yao2023Conventional).

## Structure


## Function
GOLM2, or Golgi membrane protein 2, is involved in the processing and transport of proteins within the Golgi apparatus, a critical organelle for protein modification and sorting. It plays a role in maintaining Golgi structure and function, impacting protein trafficking and secretion, which are essential for cellular communication and homeostasis (Cahill2023Investigating). The protein is implicated in Golgi transport processes, suggesting its involvement in the movement of proteins through the Golgi apparatus, which is vital for the proper functioning of cellular processes (Cahill2023Investigating).

While specific functions of GOLM2 in healthy human cells are not detailed extensively in the provided context, its role in Golgi transport indicates its importance in cellular logistics and protein handling. The protein's involvement in these processes suggests it may influence various cellular activities, including those related to metabolism and immune function, as inferred from its associations with inflammation and immune pathways in disease contexts (Zhao2024Using; Yao2023Conventional). However, the precise molecular activities and cellular locations of GOLM2 in non-disease states remain to be fully elucidated.
