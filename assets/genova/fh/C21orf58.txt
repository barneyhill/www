# C21orf58

## Overview
C21orf58 is a gene located on chromosome 21 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 21 open reading frame 58. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and cellular communication, and plays a role in the regulation of gene expression and protein interactions. It is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing cell growth and differentiation, which underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper cell cycle progression. The protein's involvement in these processes suggests its potential impact on organismal outcomes, particularly in the context of disease. C21orf58 has been implicated in several cancers, including breast cancer, where it is associated with tumor cell survival and immune cell infiltration (Zhang2018A; Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Additionally, it is part of a prognostic biomarker signature in hepatocellular carcinoma and has been linked to epigenetic regulation in hearing loss (Patil2024A; Xie2020A). Despite these associations, the precise molecular functions and interactions of C21orf58 remain an active area of research, with ongoing studies aimed at elucidating its role in human health and disease.

## Function
C21orf58, located on chromosome 21, encodes a protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and cellular communication. This protein is involved in the regulation of gene expression and protein interactions, which are crucial for maintaining normal cellular functions. In healthy human cells, C21orf58 is active in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, where it influences cell growth and differentiation. These activities suggest that C21orf58 is integral to the proper functioning of cellular mechanisms that govern cell cycle progression and development. The protein's involvement in these processes highlights its potential impact on organismal outcomes, as it may contribute to the regulation of cellular responses to external stimuli and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Understanding the precise molecular activities of C21orf58 and its interactions with other cellular components remains an area of active research, as these insights could provide further clarity on its role in human health and disease.

## Clinical Significance
C21orf58 has been implicated in various cancers and other conditions through alterations in its expression and interactions. In cancer, C21orf58 is associated with tumor immune cell infiltration, particularly in thymoma, and its expression correlates with immune cell infiltration in various primary and metastatic tumors (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). It is also part of a seven-gene signature used as a prognostic biomarker in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where it has been shown to negatively affect prognosis (Xie2020A). In breast cancer, C21orf58 is linked to genetic variants that may influence cancer susceptibility, as evidenced by its significant expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) association in breast mammary tissue and whole blood (Zhou2021Coding).

Beyond cancer, C21orf58 has been studied in the context of hearing loss, where significant methylation variations in its promoter region have been identified (Patil2024A). These findings suggest that C21orf58 may play a role in the epigenetic regulation of hearing-related genes. Despite these associations, the specific mechanisms by which C21orf58 contributes to these conditions remain unclear, necessitating further research to elucidate its clinical significance.

## Interactions
C21orf58, located on chromosome 21, is implicated in breast cancer development through its interactions with other genes and regulatory elements. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs13047478, within the exon of C21orf58, results in an amino acid change from proline to serine and is associated with breast cancer susceptibility. This SNP exhibits enhancer activity, suggesting it functions as a transcriptional regulatory element. Functional analyses indicate that C21orf58 is crucial for the survival of breast cancer cells, as its knockdown via siRNA leads to reduced cell growth and viability. C21orf58 is highly expressed in invasive breast carcinoma compared to normal breast tissue (Zhang2018A).

Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis has shown that rs13047478 is associated with the expression of the genes MCM3AP and YBEY in breast tissue. Chromatin interaction data from ChIA-PET experiments in the breast cancer cell line MCF7 indicate direct physical interactions among rs13047478/C21orf58, MCM3AP, and YBEY. These interactions suggest that C21orf58 may play a role in regulating the expression of these genes, potentially influencing breast cancer cell growth and survival (Zhang2018A).
