# USH1G

## Overview
The USH1G gene encodes the scaffold protein known as SANS (Scaffold protein containing Ankyrin repeats, a Sterile alpha motif, and a PDZ-binding motif), which plays a pivotal role in the Usher syndrome protein network. SANS is integral to the structural and functional integrity of sensory cells, particularly in the auditory and visual systems. It is characterized by its ability to mediate protein-protein interactions through its distinct structural domains, including ankyrin repeats, a sterile alpha motif (SAM), and a PDZ-binding motif. These domains enable SANS to interact with various proteins, forming complexes essential for the development and maintenance of sensory cell structures such as stereocilia in the inner ear and photoreceptor cells in the retina. Mutations in the USH1G gene are linked to Usher syndrome, a condition that leads to sensorineural hearing loss and retinitis pigmentosa, underscoring the gene's clinical significance in sensory disorders (Overlack2011Direct; Caberlotto2011Usher; Sorusch2019SANS).

## Structure
The USH1G gene encodes the SANS protein, a scaffold protein integral to the Usher syndrome protein network. SANS is composed of several structural domains that facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions. These domains include three N-terminal ankyrin repeats, two central domains (CENTn and CENTc), a sterile alpha motif (SAM), and a PDZ-binding motif (PBM) at the C-terminus (Fritze2023Pathogenic; Sorusch2019SANS). The ankyrin repeats are known for their role in mediating interactions with other proteins, while the SAM domain interacts directly with the PDZ domains of harmonin and whirlin (Overlack2011Direct).

The central domain of SANS, particularly the CENTn region, is crucial for its interaction with spliceosomal proteins PRPF31 and PRPF6, with distinct binding sites for each protein (Fritze2023Pathogenic). The CENTn domain also contains a Janus sequence, allowing it to change structure based on its binding partner, which contributes to its ability to interact with multiple proteins (Fritze2023Pathogenic).

SANS interacts with the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system, particularly binding to IFT-B proteins such as IFT52 and IFT57, which is essential for ciliary function in photoreceptor cells (Sorusch2019SANS). The protein's structure and interactions are critical for its function in the USH protein network, linking it to the microtubule cytoskeleton and facilitating intracellular transport processes (Overlack2011Direct).

## Function
The USH1G gene encodes the protein sans, which is a critical component of the tip-link complex in auditory hair cells. This complex is essential for the cohesion and proper functioning of stereocilia, which are involved in the mechanotransduction process that converts acoustic energy into electrical signals in the auditory system. Sans interacts with cadherin-23 and protocadherin-15, maintaining the structure and function of these links. It plays a role in actin polymerization at the tips of stereocilia, contributing to their structural integrity and function (Caberlotto2011Usher).

In the retina, sans functions as a scaffold protein within the Usher syndrome protein network, interacting with proteins such as harmonin and whirlin. It is involved in organizing a harmonin-independent USH protein network at the ciliary apparatus of vertebrate photoreceptor cells. Sans is crucial for maintaining synaptic integrity in photoreceptor cells and is involved in the development of stereocilia in inner ear hair cells (Overlack2008SANS). It also plays a role in the periciliary protein network, essential for transport processes between the inner and outer segments of photoreceptor cells, linking the USH protein network to the microtubule cytoskeleton and intracellular transport processes (Overlack2011Direct).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the USH1G gene, which encodes the SANS protein, are associated with Usher syndrome, a genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder. Usher syndrome is characterized by sensorineural hearing impairment, retinitis pigmentosa, and sometimes vestibular dysfunction. The most severe form, Usher syndrome type 1 (USH1), involves profound congenital hearing loss, rapidly progressing retinitis pigmentosa, and vestibular dysfunction. USH1G is part of the 'Usherinteractome,' a network crucial for the cohesion of hair bundles in the inner ear, and its mutations can lead to atypical forms of Usher syndrome (D’Esposito2019Novel).

Despite its role in the Usher protein network, USH1G has a minor involvement in the pathogenesis of Usher syndrome compared to other USH1 genes. In a study of 109 Spanish patients with various types of Usher syndrome, only eight changes in the USH1G gene were detected, none with a clear pathogenic effect. This suggests that while USH1G mutations can cause non-syndromic deafness, non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa, and atypical Usher forms, their overall contribution is relatively low (Aller2007Screening). Specific mutations, such as D458V in SANS, have been associated with hearing loss, mild retinitis pigmentosa symptoms, and normal vestibular function (Aller2007Screening).

## Interactions
The USH1G gene encodes the protein sans, which is a key component of the Usher syndrome type 1 protein network. Sans interacts with several proteins, forming complexes crucial for sensory cell function. It directly interacts with harmonin (USH1C) through its SAM domain and harmonin's N-terminal and first PDZ domains, forming a stable complex essential for sensory cell development (Yan2010The). Sans also binds to myosin VIIa (MYO7A) via its MyTH4-FERM domains, with a preference for the first repeat, and can form homomeric structures through its central region (Adato2004Interactions).

Sans is involved in a ternary complex with USH2A (usherin) and whirlin (USH2D), which is vital for maintaining USH protein networks in photoreceptor cells and hair cells (Sorusch2017Characterization). It binds to USH2A and whirlin simultaneously, reinforcing its role as a scaffold protein (Sorusch2017Characterization). Additionally, sans participates in the tip-link complex of cochlear hair cells, interacting with protocadherin-15 and cadherin-23, which are essential for actin polymerization and stereocilia cohesion (Caberlotto2011Usher). These interactions highlight sans's critical role in the structural and functional integrity of sensory cells.
