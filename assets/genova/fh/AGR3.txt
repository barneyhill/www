# AGR3

## Overview
AGR3, or anterior gradient 3, is a gene that encodes a member of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family, specifically the anterior gradient 3 protein. This protein is characterized by its involvement in the formation and rearrangement of disulfide bonds, which are crucial for protein folding and cellular homeostasis. AGR3 is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum and is implicated in the production of mucins and epithelial cell differentiation. Unlike its homolog AGR2, AGR3 does not form stable dimers in solution but can interact with AGR2 to form hetero-oligomeric complexes, suggesting a role in cellular signaling and potential implications in cancer biology (Nguyen2018Crystal; Černocká2021AGR2AGR3). AGR3's expression is notably associated with various cancers, including breast and ovarian cancer, where it serves as a potential biomarker for prognosis and therapeutic targeting (de2022AGR2; King2011The).

## Structure
The human anterior gradient protein 3 (AGR3) is a member of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family, characterized by a thioredoxin fold. The crystal structure of AGR3 reveals a single-domain protein composed of four beta-strands and four alpha-helices. These beta-strands form a beta-sheet with three parallel strands and one antiparallel strand, which is surrounded by the alpha-helices (Nguyen2018Crystal). The active site of AGR3 contains a DCYQS motif, differing from the canonical WCXXC motif found in other PDI family members, indicating AGR3's distinct functional role (Nguyen2018Crystal).

A notable feature of AGR3 is the presence of a cis-proline peptide bond near the active site, which is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and catalytic activity typical of PDI-family proteins (Nguyen2018Crystal). The structure also includes a conserved arginine residue, Arg139, which is thought to be functionally equivalent to Arg120 in other PDI-family proteins, potentially influencing AGR3's function (Nguyen2018Crystal).

AGR3 does not form stable dimers in solution, unlike its homolog AGR2, which forms dimers through an antiparallel association (Nguyen2018Crystal). The protein enters the secretory pathway via a cleavable N-terminal signal sequence and possesses a nonstandard ER-retention/retrieval motif at its C-terminus (Nguyen2018Crystal).

## Function
AGR3 (anterior gradient 3) is a member of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family, which is involved in the formation and rearrangement of disulfide bonds in proteins, playing a crucial role in protein folding and cellular homeostasis. AGR3 is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it participates in the production of mucins and epithelial cell differentiation (Obacz2015The). In healthy human tissues, AGR3 is predominantly expressed in endoderm-derived organs such as the stomach, colon, and respiratory system, although its expression is lower in normal skin and urinary bladder compared to AGR2, a closely related protein (Obacz2015The).

The specific physiological role of AGR3 in healthy tissues is not fully understood, but it is suggested to be involved in regulating the total protein load in cells, similar to AGR2, which is known to regulate cell proliferation and differentiation in the mammary gland (Obacz2015The). AGR3's expression patterns in healthy tissues and its potential interactions with other proteins indicate that it may have roles in maintaining epithelial integrity and possibly in processes related to cell adhesion and motility (Obacz2015The). Further research is needed to elucidate its precise functions in various tissues.

## Clinical Significance
AGR3 has been implicated in various cancers, including breast and ovarian cancer, due to alterations in its expression levels. In breast cancer, AGR3 expression is associated with different clinical outcomes depending on the subtype. High AGR3 expression is linked to shorter overall survival and relapse-free survival in basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) and luminal B subtypes, while low expression is associated with poor survival in luminal A subtype (de2022AGR2). AGR3 is also considered a potential biomarker for breast cancer prognosis and early detection, particularly in non-basal-like subtypes (de2022AGR2).

In ovarian cancer, AGR3 is identified as a novel biomarker, with its expression correlating with better survival outcomes in low-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (LG) and serous borderline ovarian tumors (SBOT) (King2011The). AGR3 expression is significant in mucinous ovarian cancer and is implicated in mediating resistance to cisplatin, a common chemotherapeutic agent, suggesting its role in drug resistance (Gray2012Anterior). These findings highlight AGR3's potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in cancers where it is overexpressed or dysregulated.

## Interactions
AGR3, a member of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family, is known to interact with AGR2 to form hetero-oligomeric complexes. These interactions have been confirmed both in vitro and in vivo, with the formation of these complexes involving hydrophobic interactions and intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Specific residues such as A151 and P154 in AGR2, and Y136, S137, N138, and E144 in AGR3, play crucial roles in stabilizing these complexes (Černocká2021AGR2AGR3). The interaction between AGR2 and AGR3 is relatively weak and requires a crosslinking agent for detection, indicating a transient nature (Černocká2021AGR2AGR3).

AGR3 does not form stable assemblies in solution, unlike AGR2, which forms dimers through antiparallel association stabilized by salt bridges (Nguyen2018Crystal). However, AGR3 can form complexes with AGR2 that alter its structure, as evidenced by electrochemical studies showing significant structural changes in AGR3 when interacting with AGR2 (Černocká2021AGR2AGR3).

AGR3 also interacts with specific antibodies, such as Ab3.1, at charged interfaces. This interaction is electro-active, leading to significant changes in electrochemical signals, which suggests specific binding interactions (Ostatná2019Anterior). These interactions highlight AGR3's role in cellular signaling and its potential implications in cancer biology.
