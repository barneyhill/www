# USP11

## Overview
USP11 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquitin specific peptidase 11, a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including DNA repair and chromatin reorganization. As a member of the ubiquitin-specific protease family, USP11 is characterized by its ability to remove ubiquitin moieties from target proteins, thereby regulating their stability and function. The protein is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it interacts with key components of the DNA damage response machinery, such as RAD51 and 53BP1, to facilitate the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (Wiltshire2010Sensitivity; Ting2019USP11). Additionally, USP11 is involved in maintaining genomic stability by modulating R-loop levels through its interaction with the helicase senataxin (Jurga2021USP11). The enzyme's activity is crucial for cellular resistance to genotoxic stress, and its dysregulation has been implicated in various cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Sun2019USP11; Zhang2018Ubiquitinspecific).

## Structure
USP11 is a deubiquitinating enzyme characterized by several conserved domains typical of ubiquitin-specific proteases, including the Cys box, His box, Asp, and KRF domains (IDEGUCHI2002Structural). The full-length USP11 protein consists of 921 amino acids, with a molecular mass of approximately 105,183 Da (IDEGUCHI2002Structural). It contains N-terminal domains, specifically the DUSP and UBL domains, which are involved in molecular interactions with peptide ligands (Spiliotopoulos2019Discovery). The UBL domain of USP11 is unique and not present in its paralogs USP4 and USP15, contributing to its specific interactions with certain peptide ligands (Spiliotopoulos2019Discovery).

The crystal structure of USP11 reveals that the peptide-binding site includes the S3-S4 loop and a conserved C-terminal sequence extension (WPSAQL) to the UBL core (Spiliotopoulos2019Discovery). The binding of peptide ligands to USP11 involves hydrophobic pockets and hydrogen bonding interactions, with key residues such as His-161, Trp-200, and Leu-245 playing significant roles (Spiliotopoulos2019Discovery). USP11 is primarily localized in the nucleus of non-dividing cells and throughout the cytoplasm in mitotic cells, suggesting a potential association with nuclear proteins like RanBPM (IDEGUCHI2002Structural).

## Function
USP11 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 11) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability in healthy human cells. It is involved in the DNA damage response, particularly in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks through homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathways. USP11 facilitates the repair process by regulating the recruitment and stability of key repair proteins such as RAD51 and 53BP1 at damage sites (Wiltshire2010Sensitivity; Ting2019USP11).

USP11 also regulates R-loop levels by controlling the proteostasis of senataxin (SETX), a helicase involved in resolving R-loops. By deubiquitinating SETX, USP11 prevents its degradation, thereby maintaining proper R-loop homeostasis and preventing genomic instability (Jurga2021USP11). The enzyme's activity is crucial for suppressing elevated R-loop levels, which can lead to DNA breaks if not properly managed (Jurga2021USP11).

USP11 is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it interacts with chromatin and other nuclear proteins to execute its functions. Its enzymatic activity is essential for its role in DNA repair and chromatin reorganization, contributing to cell survival and resistance to genotoxic stress (Ting2019USP11).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the USP11 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), high USP11 expression is associated with poor prognosis, increased risk of metastasis, and reduced overall survival. It promotes HCC cell invasion and migration, making it a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Zhang2018Ubiquitinspecific). In colorectal cancer (CRC), USP11 is overexpressed and functions as an oncogene by stabilizing PPP1CA, which activates the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway, promoting tumor growth and metastasis (Sun2019USP11).

In breast cancer, USP11 stabilizes XIAP, an inhibitor of apoptosis, thereby promoting tumorigenesis and increasing drug resistance (Zhou2017Regulation). In melanoma, USP11 facilitates proliferation by deubiquitinating NONO, suggesting its role in cancer progression (Liao2022Ubiquitin). Conversely, in some contexts, USP11 may act as a tumor suppressor, as seen in skin cancers where its downregulation is an early event in tumor development (Liao2022Ubiquitin).

Beyond cancer, USP11 is involved in liver diseases, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), where it affects lipid metabolism and cell growth (Yang2021USP11). These findings highlight USP11's significant role in disease progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
USP11, a ubiquitin-specific peptidase, engages in several significant protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. It specifically interacts with the BRCA2-PALB2 complex, playing a crucial role in DNA repair pathways by regulating the ubiquitination status of this complex (Spiliotopoulos2019Discovery). USP11 also interacts with γH2AX, a phosphorylated histone variant, where it acts as a deubiquitylation enzyme, thereby regulating DNA damage response (Yu2016USP11).

USP11 stabilizes the HPV-16E7 protein by preventing its degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, a process crucial for the stability of HPV-16E7 and its biological activity (Lin2008USP11). It also associates with RanBPM, a RanGTP-associated protein, as demonstrated through yeast two-hybrid assays and co-immunoprecipitation studies (IDEGUCHI2002Structural).

In cancer-related pathways, USP11 interacts with various proteins, such as NRF2, where it reverses NRF2 polyubiquitination, stabilizing it and influencing cell proliferation and ferroptosis (Meng2021The). These interactions highlight USP11's multifaceted role in cellular regulation and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer management.
