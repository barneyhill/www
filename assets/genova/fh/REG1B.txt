# REG1B

## Overview
REG1B is a gene that encodes the protein regenerating family member 1 beta, which is part of the regenerating islet-derived (Reg) protein family. This protein is characterized by the presence of a C-type-like lectin domain (CTLD), which facilitates binding to various ligands and carbohydrates, playing a crucial role in the gastrointestinal tract's low-pH environment (Chen2019Four). REG1B shares a high degree of homology with REG1A, differing by a single amino acid, which may influence its structural and functional properties (Lee2018Epitope). The protein is involved in several biological processes, including interactions with other proteins such as REG1A, and is implicated in various diseases, particularly those affecting the pancreas and gastrointestinal tract (Huttlin2020Dual). Its expression levels are associated with conditions like pancreatic cancer and inflammatory bowel diseases, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Chen2019Four).

## Structure
The REG1B protein is a member of the Reg family, characterized by a primary structure that includes a C-type-like lectin domain (CTLD), which is involved in binding a variety of ligands and carbohydrates (Chen2019Four). REG1B is 87% homologous to REG1A, differing at position 54 where REG1A has an arginine and REG1B has a proline (Lee2018Epitope). This difference may influence the protein's charge and structural properties. The CTLD typically binds carbohydrates in a calcium-independent manner, which is significant for interactions in the low-pH environment of the gastrointestinal tract (Chen2019Four).

The secondary structure of REG1B includes an extended loop and an alpha-helix, as observed in peptide 7 derived from REG1B, which contributes to its solubility and recognition capabilities (Lee2018Epitope). Although specific details on the tertiary and quaternary structures of REG1B are not provided, the presence of the CTLD suggests a role in maintaining structural integrity and function. Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation are common in Reg proteins, contributing to their stability and localization, although specific modifications for REG1B are not detailed (Chen2019Four).

## Clinical Significance
REG1B is implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression levels. In pancreatic cancer, REG1B is expressed in early-stage pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and throughout its development. Elevated levels of REG1B in the serum and urine of PDAC patients suggest its potential as a biomarker for early detection. Interestingly, higher levels of REG1B correlate with increased survival rates in pancreatic cancer patients, indicating a complex role in disease progression (Chen2019Four).

In the gastrointestinal tract, REG1B is upregulated in inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), where its expression is promoted by interleukins like IL-22. This upregulation suggests a role in the inflammatory response and potential as a therapeutic target (Chen2019Four). REG1B is also increased in acute amoebic colitis, a parasitic infection, highlighting its involvement in various gastrointestinal conditions (Chen2019Four).

While REG1B has protective effects against bowel damage from nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), its pro-proliferative effects may increase the risk of tumorigenesis in the colon or stomach, suggesting a dual role in both promoting and protecting against disease (Chen2019Four).

## Interactions
REG1B, a member of the regenerating islet-derived (Reg) protein family, is involved in various protein interactions that contribute to its biological functions. The BioPlex 3.0 network has identified a physical interaction between REG1B and REG1A, suggesting that REG1B may participate in a protein complex or have a direct interaction with REG1A. This interaction was confirmed reciprocally, indicating a robust association between these two proteins (Huttlin2020Dual).

While specific interactions of REG1B with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed, the high homology between REG1A and REG1B suggests potential similarities in their interactions. REG1A is known for its C-type-like lectin domain, which allows it to bind various ligands and carbohydrates, often mediated by calcium ions. This structural similarity implies that REG1B might also engage in similar binding interactions, although direct evidence is lacking (Chen2019Four).

The regulation of REG1B expression and its involvement in signaling pathways remain areas of active research. Although interactions with pathways involving mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) have been suggested, these interactions are not well-defined (Chen2019Four).
