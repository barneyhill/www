# P2RX6

## Overview
The P2RX6 gene encodes the purinergic receptor P2X 6 (P2X6R), a member of the P2X receptor family, which are ATP-gated ion channels. These receptors are integral membrane proteins that facilitate the passage of cations such as Na+, Ca2+, and K+ across the cell membrane, playing a significant role in cellular excitability and signaling. P2X6R is characterized by its ability to form heteromeric complexes with other P2X subunits, such as P2X4, and is involved in various physiological processes, including ion transport and mRNA splicing. The receptor is expressed in multiple tissues, including the midbrain, atrium, kidney, and urinary bladder, indicating its diverse functional roles. Glycosylation of P2X6R is a critical post-translational modification that influences its folding, assembly, and function, with implications for its role in cellular signaling and gene expression (North2016P2X; Patritti‐Cram2021Purinergic; Illes2020Update).

## Structure
The P2RX6 gene encodes the P2X6R protein, an ATP-gated ion channel that is part of the P2X receptor family. The primary structure of P2X6R includes a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, with specific asparagine residues at positions 157, 187, and 202 in the rat isoform, which are sites for N-linked glycosylation (Illes2020Update). Glycosylation is a crucial post-translational modification that affects the protein's folding, assembly, and membrane trafficking, with functional P2X6R proteins having a molecular mass of 70 kDa (Illes2020Update).

The secondary structure of P2X receptors typically includes two transmembrane regions, an intracellular N-terminus, and a C-terminus, along with a large extracellular domain (North2016P2X). The tertiary structure involves the 3D folding of these domains, forming a trimeric assembly, which is the quaternary structure of P2X receptors, including P2X6R (North2016P2X).

P2X6R can form heteromers with other P2X subunits, such as P2X4, although its specific role in certain physiological processes, like renal electrolyte handling, remains unclear (de2016P2X6). The protein's ability to translocate to the nucleus and interact with splicing factors suggests a role in mRNA splicing, particularly when non-glycosylated (Illes2020Update).

## Function
The P2RX6 gene encodes the P2X6 receptor, a member of the purinergic receptor family, which are ATP-gated ion channels. P2X6 receptors are involved in various cellular processes, including ion transport and regulation of cellular signaling pathways. In healthy human cells, P2X6 is expressed in several tissues, such as the midbrain, atrium, kidney, thymocytes, and urinary bladder, indicating its potential role in these areas (Illes2020Update). The receptor functions as a non-selective cationic channel, allowing the passage of ions like Na+, Ca2+, and K+ across the cell membrane, which can influence cellular excitability and signaling (North2016P2X; Illes2020Update).

Glycosylation of P2X6R affects its folding, assembly, and function, with fully glycosylated forms acting as slowly desensitizing channels. Non-glycosylated P2X6R can translocate to the nucleus in neurons, where it interacts with splicing factors to influence mRNA splicing, suggesting a regulatory role in gene expression (Illes2020Update). P2X6 is also expressed on endothelial cells in the human endoneurium, although its specific functions in these cells remain less characterized (Patritti‐Cram2021Purinergic). Overall, P2X6 plays a role in modulating ion homeostasis and cellular signaling, contributing to various physiological processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the P2RX6 gene have been linked to various diseases, notably renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and myopathy. In RCC, P2RX6 is highly expressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and this overexpression is associated with poor prognosis. The gene's expression correlates with RCC pathological stage, grade, and metastasis, with higher levels linked to worse overall survival in patients. The ATP-P2RX6 axis is crucial for RCC cell migration and invasion, primarily through the modulation of calcium influx and the activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. This pathway also involves MMP9, a downstream gene whose expression is associated with poor prognosis in RCC patients. The regulation of P2RX6 by m6A RNA methylation, particularly through the methyltransferase METTL14, further influences its role in RCC progression (Gong2019The).

In myopathy, a novel homozygous deletion in the P2RX6 gene results in a truncated protein, disrupting its normal function. This mutation is associated with early-stage myopathy symptoms, such as muscle weakness and numbness, and suggests an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. The mutation affects the interaction with extracellular ATP, impacting ion flow through the P2X6 receptor, which is crucial for muscle development and function (Vinci2024Next).
