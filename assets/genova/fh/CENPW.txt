# CENPW

## Overview
CENPW, or centromere protein W, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the structure and function of the centromere, a key component of the chromosome essential for proper cell division. The protein encoded by CENPW is a part of the Constitutive Centromere Associated Network (CCAN), which is crucial for the assembly and stabilization of the kinetochore, a multi-protein complex that facilitates chromosome segregation during mitosis (Reinhold2011Identification). CENPW forms a DNA-binding heterodimer with CENP-T and is involved in the organization of centromeric chromatin, interacting with the centromere-specific histone H3 variant CENPA (Zhou2020Histonefold). This interaction is vital for the transition of centromeric chromatin to a mitotic state, ensuring accurate chromosome segregation and genomic stability (Wang2022Investigating). Additionally, CENPW has been implicated in various cancers, where its altered expression is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Wang2022Investigating; Zhou2021Knockdown).

## Function
CENPW, also known as centromere protein W, is a crucial component of the centromere complex involved in chromosome segregation during cell division. It is part of the Constitutive Centromere Associated Network (CCAN), which is essential for kinetochore assembly. The kinetochore is a multi-protein structure that assembles on centromeric DNA, mediating the binding of spindle microtubules to chromosomes and facilitating chromosome movement (Reinhold2011Identification). CENPW interacts with the centromere-specific histone H3 variant CENPA, playing a key role in organizing centromeric chromatin structure (Reinhold2011Identification).

In healthy cells, CENPW is involved in nucleosome assembly and positioning, as well as DNA and chromatin regulation. It forms a DNA-binding heterodimer with CENP-T, which is essential for switching centromeric chromatin to a mitotic state (Zhou2020Histonefold; Wang2022Investigating). This interaction is crucial for the proper attachment of centromere microtubules and the progression of mitosis, ensuring accurate chromosome segregation and maintaining genomic stability (Zhang2024CENPW). CENPW's activity is primarily localized at the centromere, where it contributes to the assembly and stabilization of the kinetochore (Reinhold2011Identification).

## Clinical Significance
CENPW (centromere protein W) has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CENPW is upregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal liver tissues. This upregulation is associated with higher tumor grades and poor survival outcomes. Knockdown of CENPW in HCC cell lines results in inhibited cell proliferation, induced cell cycle arrest, decreased cell migration and invasion, and increased apoptosis, suggesting its role in cancer progression through the activation of E2F signaling (Zhou2021Knockdown).

In breast carcinoma, CENPW is significantly overexpressed, particularly in ductal and medullary subtypes, and is associated with poor prognosis, including worse overall survival and relapse-free survival. Its expression is notably higher in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and is linked to various clinicopathological features such as patient age and nodal metastasis. CENPW knockdown in breast cancer cell lines reduces cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and increases sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs (Wang2022Investigating).

These findings suggest that CENPW acts as an oncogene in multiple cancer types, making it a potential biomarker for cancer progression and a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
CENPW, also known as centromere protein W, is involved in several physical interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It forms a DNA-binding heterodimer with CENP-T, and together with CENP-S and CENP-X, they create a stable CENP-T-W-S-X heterotetramer. This complex has a histone-like fold and interacts with DNA to form a unique centromeric chromatin structure, binding to approximately 100 base pairs of DNA to create a nucleosome-like structure (Zhou2020Histonefold). CENPW also directly interacts with nucleosome components through histone H2B, linking the centromere to the nucleosome (Zhou2020Histonefold).

In addition to its role in centromeric chromatin, CENPW interacts with proteins such as nucleophosmin (NPM) and enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), facilitating chromatin transcription in the nucleus (Deng2023CENPW; Zhou2020Histonefold). CENPW is a part of the Constitutive Centromere Associated Network (CCAN), which is essential for kinetochore assembly and function, interacting with the centromere-specific histone H3 variant CENPA (Reinhold2011Identification). These interactions highlight CENPW's critical role in chromosome segregation and cell division.
