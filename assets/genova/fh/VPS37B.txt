# VPS37B

## Overview
VPS37B is a gene that encodes the VPS37B protein, a subunit of the Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport-I (ESCRT-I). This protein is integral to the ESCRT-I complex, which is involved in critical cellular processes such as endosomal sorting, membrane remodeling, and vesicle trafficking. The VPS37B protein is characterized by its intrinsic disorder and contains a proline-rich domain, which facilitates its interaction with other proteins within the ESCRT-I complex, such as TSG101 and VPS28. These interactions are essential for the formation and stability of the ESCRT-I complex, which plays a pivotal role in cellular homeostasis and membrane repair (Kolmus2020Concurrent; Ashraf2024Intrinsic). VPS37B's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and its potential implications in pathological conditions, including certain cancers (Kolmus2020Concurrent; An2012Frameshift).

## Structure
VPS37B is a component of the ESCRT-I complex, which plays a crucial role in vesicular transport processes. The protein is composed of 285 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 31,056 Da (Ashraf2024Intrinsic). The molecular structure of VPS37B includes a C-terminal domain (residues 84-173) that is involved in the assembly of the ESCRT-I complex and a region (50-170) that interacts with the ESCRT-III protein IST1 (Ashraf2024Intrinsic). 

VPS37B is characterized by significant intrinsic disorder, with disordered regions identified at residues 1-9, 13-18, 23-62, 90-102, 113-126, and 149-285 (Ashraf2024Intrinsic). The protein also contains a proline-rich domain (PRD) at its C-terminus, which is a common feature among VPS37B, VPS37C, and VPS37D (Li2015The). 

The 3D structure model generated by AlphaFold suggests the presence of a long α-helix (residues 36-100), which may not exist as a stable structure but could form in a bound state (Ashraf2024Intrinsic). VPS37B has a ubiquitylation site at Lys 45 and is predicted to have a high probability of liquid-liquid phase separation, indicating a role in droplet formation (Ashraf2024Intrinsic). 

VPS37B interacts with other proteins in the ESCRT-I complex, such as TSG101 and VPS28, forming a tetrameric structure with MVB12A, which binds through a conserved VPF motif (Flower2020A). The protein's interaction capabilities are further highlighted by its involvement in a highly connected protein-protein interaction network (Ashraf2024Intrinsic).

## Function
VPS37B is a crucial component of the ESCRT-I (Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport-I) complex, which plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including endosomal sorting, membrane remodeling, and vesicle trafficking. In healthy human cells, VPS37B is involved in maintaining the stability and proper functioning of the ESCRT-I complex, which is essential for cellular processes such as vesicle trafficking and membrane repair (Kolmus2020Concurrent). VPS37B, along with other VPS37 family members, contributes to the assembly of distinct ESCRT-I complexes, which are vital for maintaining cell homeostasis (Kolmus2020Concurrent).

The protein is active in the cytoplasm, particularly at endosomal membranes, where it facilitates the trafficking of ubiquitinated proteins to the lysosome for degradation. This function is critical for processes like membrane budding and cytokinesis (Kolmus2020Concurrent). VPS37B also shows a preference for partnering with specific ESCRT-I subunits, such as Mvb12A, indicating selective incorporation into the complex (Kolmus2020Concurrent). The stability of ESCRT-I subunits is interdependent, and VPS37B's role in this stability underscores its importance in normal cellular functions (Kolmus2020Concurrent).

## Clinical Significance
VPS37B, a subunit of the ESCRT-I complex, has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in cellular processes such as endosomal sorting and membrane trafficking. In gastric and colorectal cancers with high microsatellite instability (MSI-H), frameshift mutations in VPS37B have been identified, leading to truncated proteins that may disrupt normal cellular functions and contribute to cancer development (An2012Frameshift). These mutations are not associated with low MSI or stable microsatellites, indicating a specific link to MSI-H cancers (An2012Frameshift).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), decreased expression of VPS37B has been observed, particularly in advanced stages, suggesting its involvement in cancer progression (Kolmus2020Concurrent). The reduced expression of VPS37B is associated with increased inflammatory responses, as indicated by elevated levels of inflammatory markers such as CXCL8 and ICAM1 in CRC patients (Kolmus2020Concurrent). The concurrent depletion of VPS37B and other VPS37 paralogs can lead to ESCRT-I destabilization, triggering cellular stress responses and inhibiting cell growth, which may further contribute to tumorigenesis (Kolmus2020Concurrent). These findings highlight the potential of VPS37B as a therapeutic target in cancers characterized by its altered expression or mutation.

## Interactions
VPS37B is a component of the ESCRT-I complex, which is crucial for the sorting of ubiquitinated proteins into multivesicular bodies. It interacts with other core components of the ESCRT-I complex, including TSG101 and VPS28, forming a stable complex essential for its function (Bache2004The; Ashraf2024Intrinsic). VPS37B also associates with auxiliary proteins such as MVB12A, which can integrate into ESCRT-I complexes with VPS37B, indicating a preference for this interaction over others like UBAP1, which preferentially associates with VPS37A (Kolmus2020Concurrent; Wunderley2013The).

The protein is characterized by a high degree of intrinsic disorder, which facilitates its interaction with multiple partners. It contains a proline-rich region (PRR) that is essential for protein-protein interactions, and it is predicted to have multiple Molecular Recognition Features (MoRFs) that enhance its interaction potential (Kolmus2020Concurrent; Ashraf2024Intrinsic). VPS37B's interactions are not limited to stable complexes; it also participates in more transient interactions, such as those involved in cellular signaling pathways, including NF-κB and MAPK signaling, which are activated upon its depletion (Kolmus2020Concurrent).
