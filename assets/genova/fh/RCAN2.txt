# RCAN2

## Overview
RCAN2, or regulator of calcineurin 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of calcineurin, a calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase. The RCAN2 protein functions primarily as a negative regulator of calcineurin, influencing calcium signaling pathways that are critical for numerous cellular processes, including T-cell activation, neuronal signaling, and cardiac function (Mammarella2021NUAK2). Additionally, RCAN2 is involved in the control of cilia length and is localized to centrioles and the basal body, playing a role in pathways such as sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling (Stevenson2017Regulator). The gene's expression and the protein's interactions have significant implications in various physiological and pathological contexts, including obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, cardiovascular health, and cancer, particularly in the context of mutant p53 networks in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Fang2022Elevated; Mammarella2021NUAK2).

## Function
RCAN2, or regulator of calcineurin 2, is a protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of calcineurin, a calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase. In healthy human cells, RCAN2 acts as a negative regulator of calcineurin, modulating its activity and thereby influencing calcium signaling pathways. This regulation is crucial for various cellular processes, including T-cell activation, neuronal signaling, and cardiac function (Mammarella2021NUAK2).

RCAN2 is involved in cilia length control, particularly in the context of centriolar proteins. It localizes to centrioles and the basal body, where it helps maintain normal cilia length. This function is essential for proper cellular signaling and environmental sensing, as cilia are involved in pathways like sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling (Stevenson2017Regulator). In giantin knockout cells, RCAN2 is upregulated, suggesting a compensatory mechanism to maintain cilia function in the absence of giantin (Stevenson2017Regulator).

RCAN2 also plays a role in the calcineurin/NFAT signaling pathways, potentially regulating gene transcription and correcting deficiencies in certain cellular contexts (Stevenson2017Regulator). Its concentration at the base of the cilium may restrict calcium-dependent calcineurin signaling to the cilium, impacting ciliary signaling and related cellular functions (Stevenson2017Regulator).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RCAN2 gene have been associated with several metabolic and pathological conditions. In the context of obesity, RCAN2 has been linked to weight gain and obesity-related metabolic disorders. Studies have shown that inactivation of the RCAN2 gene in mice leads to reduced food intake and resistance to age- and diet-induced obesity, suggesting a role in body weight regulation independent of the leptin pathway (Sun2011Inactivation). Elevated serum levels of RCAN2 have been associated with an increased risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in humans, indicating its potential as a biomarker for this condition (Fang2022Elevated).

RCAN2 is also implicated in cardiovascular health, with higher serum levels observed in metabolically unhealthy individuals, correlating with increased systolic blood pressure and fasting blood glucose levels (Wang2022Higher). In cancer biology, RCAN2 is involved in the p53 mutant pro-tumorigenic network, particularly in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, where it may contribute to the oncogenic effects of mutant p53 (Mammarella2021NUAK2). These findings suggest that RCAN2 plays a significant role in various diseases through its influence on metabolic and cellular pathways.

## Interactions
RCAN2 interacts with calcineurin, a calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase, and modulates its activity. This interaction is crucial for various cellular processes, including the regulation of ciliary function and signaling pathways. RCAN2 can both inhibit and activate calcineurin, depending on the cellular context, and is involved in the regulation of NFAT signaling pathways, which are calcineurin-dependent (Stevenson2017Regulator).

In zebrafish, RCAN2 plays a role in the development of pectoral fin buds by interacting with the Kcnk5b channel. RCAN2 inhibits calcineurin, which in turn limits fin growth by inhibiting Kcnk5b through serine 345. This interaction highlights RCAN2's role in modulating ion channel activity and influencing developmental processes (Jiang2024The).

RCAN2 is also implicated in a pro-tumorigenic network associated with mutant p53 proteins in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. It is part of a regulatory axis involving NUAK2 and mutant p53, suggesting its involvement in cancer progression through interactions with other proteins in the mutant p53 network (Mammarella2021NUAK2).
