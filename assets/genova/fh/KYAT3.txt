# KYAT3

## Overview
KYAT3 is a gene that encodes the enzyme kynurenine aminotransferase 3, which is a key player in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism. This enzyme is categorized as a transferase, specifically involved in the transamination process that converts kynurenine to kynurenic acid, a metabolite with significant immunomodulatory and neuroactive properties. Kynurenine aminotransferase 3 is expressed predominantly in the liver and kidney, where it contributes to the regulation of tryptophan levels and the production of kynurenic acid, particularly under conditions of inflammation and metabolic stress (Zhen2022Kynurenic). The gene's activity and expression have been linked to various physiological and pathological processes, including cancer progression, metabolic disorders, and neurological diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Tanaka2022Mitochondrial; Walczak2019Kynurenic).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the KYAT3 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly those involving the kynurenine pathway. In cancer, increased expression of KYAT3 has been observed in certain types, such as lymphoid neoplasm diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, suggesting a potential role in cancer progression through its involvement in the kynurenine pathway (Walczak2019Kynurenic). The gene's expression is also linked to metabolic diseases, with higher levels of KYAT3 expression found in overweight individuals, which may contribute to increased kynurenic acid production and its associated metabolic effects (Zhen2022Kynurenic).

In neurological disorders, KYAT3 is part of the broader kynurenine pathway, which is altered in conditions like multiple sclerosis and Huntington's disease. These alterations can affect the levels of kynurenic acid, a neuroactive metabolite, potentially impacting disease progression (Tanaka2022Mitochondrial). Although specific mutations in KYAT3 have not been directly linked to these conditions, its role in the pathway suggests it may contribute to the pathophysiology of these diseases. The gene's involvement in the kynurenine pathway also suggests potential implications in neuropsychiatric disorders, although direct associations with KYAT3 mutations or expression changes are not well-documented (Tanaka2022Mitochondrial).

## Interactions
KYAT3, also known as kynurenine aminotransferase 3, is involved in the kynurenine pathway, which is crucial for tryptophan metabolism. This enzyme participates in several interactions with other proteins and enzymes. In the context of selenium metabolism, KYAT3 is associated with the TRABD2B gene and interacts with other kynurenine aminotransferases such as KYAT1 and KYAT2 (Moriguchi2024GenomeWide). These interactions are significant in the KEGG pathway related to selenocompound metabolism.

In the context of tryptophan catabolism, KYAT3, along with KYAT1 and AADAT, is involved in the metabolic pathway that influences plasma tryptophan levels. Studies using liver-specific knockout mice have shown that KYAT3, along with other kynurenine aminotransferases, plays a role in regulating tryptophan levels, although the exact mechanism remains to be fully elucidated (Bowman2024Offtarget).

KYAT3 is also implicated in the production of kynurenic acid, a metabolite with immunomodulatory effects. Its expression is higher in tissues such as the kidney and liver, where it contributes to the biosynthesis of kynurenic acid, particularly in the context of inflammation and metabolic diseases (Zhen2022Kynurenic).
