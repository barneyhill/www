# DCAF8

## Overview
DCAF8, or DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 8, is a gene that encodes a protein functioning as a substrate adaptor within the CUL4-DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This protein is characterized by the presence of WD40 repeats, which form a beta-propeller structure essential for protein-protein interactions, particularly with DDB1, a core component of the ubiquitin ligase complex (Huang2020CRL4DCAF8; Klein2014Ubiquitin). The DCAF8 protein plays a pivotal role in the targeted ubiquitination and degradation of specific proteins, thereby maintaining protein homeostasis, DNA repair, and chromatin integrity (Huang2020CRL4DCAF8a). It is expressed in various tissues, including skeletal muscle and the heart, and is involved in critical cellular processes such as DNA methylation and muscle cell biology (Nowak2019DCAF8). Mutations in the DCAF8 gene have been linked to neuropathological conditions, highlighting its clinical significance in muscle atrophy and hematologic malignancies (Nowak2019DCAF8; Huang2021Systematic).

## Structure
DCAF8, also known as WDR42A, is a protein that contains WD40 repeats, which are structural motifs involved in protein-protein interactions. These repeats typically form a beta-propeller structure, contributing to the protein's tertiary structure (Huang2020CRL4DCAF8; Klein2014Ubiquitin). The WD40 domains are crucial for DCAF8's role as a substrate receptor in the CRL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, facilitating interactions with other proteins such as DDB1 (Huang2020CRL4DCAF8). 

The R317 residue of DCAF8 is located next to a conserved WDxR motif on the solvent-exposed surface of the WD40 beta-propeller, which is important for binding to DDB1 (Klein2014Ubiquitin). A mutation at this site, R317C, has been shown to decrease binding to DDB1, affecting the protein's function in substrate recruitment (Klein2014Ubiquitin).

DCAF8 is expressed in various tissues, including skeletal muscle and the heart, and is detected as a doublet with molecular masses of 70 and 80 kDa, which may represent phosphorylated forms, indicating potential post-translational modifications (Nowak2019DCAF8). The presence of different molecular weights suggests possible tissue-specific isoforms (Nowak2019DCAF8).

## Function
DCAF8 (DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 8) encodes a protein that functions as a substrate adaptor within the CUL4-DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This complex is crucial for the targeted ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of specific proteins, playing a significant role in maintaining protein homeostasis, DNA repair, and chromatin integrity (Klein2014Ubiquitin; Huang2020CRL4DCAF8a). DCAF8 contains seven WD repeats that form a beta-propeller structure, essential for its interaction with DDB1, a core component of the ubiquitin ligase complex (Klein2014Ubiquitin).

In healthy human cells, DCAF8 is involved in the regulation of various proteins, including the chromatin remodeler LSH and myeloid leukemia factor 2 (MLF2), by promoting their ubiquitination and degradation. This activity is vital for processes such as DNA methylation and protein homeostasis (Huang2020CRL4DCAF8; Huang2020CRL4DCAF8a). DCAF8 is expressed in multiple tissues, including skeletal muscle and the heart, where it interacts with proteins like MuRF1, indicating its role in muscle cell biology and potentially in muscle atrophy (Nowak2019DCAF8). The protein is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, influencing various cellular processes and contributing to normal cellular function and organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DCAF8 gene have been associated with axonal hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN2), a condition characterized by progressive muscular atrophy of the extremities. These mutations impair the interaction of DCAF8 with DDB1, which is crucial for its function in muscle mass regulation (Nowak2019DCAF8). DCAF8 is also implicated in muscle atrophy through its interaction with MuRF1, a protein involved in the degradation of myosin heavy chain (MyHC) in muscle cells. The combined activity of DCAF8 and MuRF1 mediates muscle atrophy, and their levels increase in response to atrophic stimuli. Downregulation of these proteins impedes muscle atrophy, highlighting their role in muscle wasting conditions (Nowak2019DCAF8).

In addition to its role in muscle biology, DCAF8 is involved in the degradation of the DNMT3A protein, particularly the DNMT3A W297Del variant. This process is significant in the context of clonal hematopoiesis and hematologic malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). DCAF8, as part of a ubiquitination complex, targets DNMT3A for degradation, and its ablation can prevent DNMT3A degradation, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies for conditions involving unstable DNMT3A variants (Huang2021Systematic).

## Interactions
DCAF8 interacts with several proteins as part of its role in the CUL4-DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. It functions as a substrate receptor, facilitating the ubiquitination of specific proteins. DCAF8 enhances the binding of histone H3 to DDB1 and Cul4A, promoting its ubiquitination in liver cells. This interaction is crucial for chromatin modification processes, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments showing DCAF8, DDB1, and Cul4A associating with histone H3 on chromatin (Li2017CRL4DCAF8).

In muscle cells, DCAF8 interacts with the muscle-specific RING-finger protein MuRF1 (TRIM63), forming a complex with DDB1 and Cul4A. This interaction is significant in muscle atrophy, as DCAF8 and MuRF1 levels increase during atrophy, and their downregulation impedes muscle wasting (Nowak2019DCAF8).

DCAF8 also interacts with LSH (Lymphoid-specific helicase) within the CRL4 complex, targeting LSH for ubiquitination and degradation. This interaction is essential for regulating epigenetic dynamics, as DCAF8 promotes LSH polyubiquitination (Huang2020CRL4DCAF8a).

Mutations in DCAF8, such as the p.R317C mutation, reduce its binding to DDB1, affecting the E3 ubiquitin ligase pathway and contributing to neuropathological conditions (Klein2014Ubiquitin).
