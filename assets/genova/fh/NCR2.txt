# NCR2

## Overview
NCR2 is a gene that encodes the protein known as natural cytotoxicity triggering receptor 2 (NKp44), which is a type of receptor primarily expressed on activated natural killer (NK) cells. NKp44 plays a crucial role in the immune system by recognizing and binding to specific ligands on the surface of tumor or virus-infected cells, thereby triggering NK cell activation and subsequent cytotoxic responses. This receptor is characterized by its single extracellular V-type immunoglobulin domain and a transmembrane domain that associates with the adaptor protein DAP12, which is essential for its signaling functions (Pazina2017Regulation; Barrow2019The). NKp44 is not constitutively expressed on resting NK cells but is upregulated in response to cytokines such as IL-2, IL-15, and IL-1β (Barrow2019The; Mair2022The). The receptor can mediate both activating and inhibitory signals, depending on the specific splice variants and ligands involved, highlighting its complex role in immune regulation (Pazina2017Regulation; Barrow2019The).

## Structure


## Function
The NCR2 gene encodes the NKp44 protein, a receptor primarily expressed on activated natural killer (NK) cells. NKp44 is involved in the immune response by recognizing and binding to ligands on the surface of tumor or virus-infected cells, leading to the activation of NK cells and subsequent cytotoxicity and cytokine release (Bottino2000The; Barrow2019The). This receptor is not constitutively expressed on resting NK cells but is upregulated upon stimulation by cytokines such as IL-2, IL-15, and IL-1β (Barrow2019The; Mair2022The).

NKp44 is a 44 kDa protein with a single extracellular V-type Ig domain and a transmembrane domain that associates with the ITAM-bearing adaptor protein DAP12, which is essential for its surface expression and activation signaling (Pazina2017Regulation; Barrow2019The). The receptor can mediate both activating and inhibitory signals, depending on the splice variants expressed and the ligands it interacts with (Pazina2017Regulation; Barrow2019The). NKp44's interaction with ligands such as PDGF-DD can induce NK cell degranulation and cytokine secretion, playing a significant role in tumor immunosurveillance (Barrow2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the NCR2 gene, which encodes the NKp44 receptor, have been associated with various diseases and conditions. In cancer, particularly acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the expression of the NKp44-1 isoform, which contains an inhibitory ITIM sequence, is linked to poor patient outcomes. This suggests that the inhibitory signaling mediated by NKp44-1 may suppress beneficial NK cell responses, contributing to disease progression (Pazina2017Regulation; Shemesh2017Splice). In solid tumors, NK cells predominantly express the inhibitory NKp44-1 isoform, which may also play a role in tumor immune evasion (Pazina2017Regulation).

NCR2 expression changes have been implicated in chronic periodontitis, particularly in pregnant women, indicating a potential role in inflammatory conditions (Barrow2019The). The interaction of NKp44 with ligands such as PCNA on tumor cells can inhibit NK cell cytotoxicity, forming an immunological synapse that contributes to immune evasion by tumors (Barrow2019The). These findings highlight the clinical significance of NCR2 in modulating immune responses in cancer and inflammatory diseases, suggesting potential therapeutic targets for modulating NK cell activity.

## Interactions
NCR2, also known as NKp44, is a receptor involved in various interactions with ligands that influence natural killer (NK) cell activity. NKp44 interacts with a splice variant of mixed-lineage leukemia protein-5 (MLL5), known as 21spe-MLL5, which is expressed on tumor cells and triggers NKp44-mediated cytotoxicity (Parodi2019NKp44NKp44). It also binds to Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) on cancer cells, inhibiting NK cell cytotoxicity and serving as an immune evasion mechanism (Iraqi2022Blocking; Parodi2019NKp44NKp44). 

NKp44 recognizes highly sulfated heparan sulfate structures, enhancing IFN-γ secretion, and interacts with syndecan-4 (SDC4) on NK cells, which dampens NKp44-mediated activation (Parodi2019NKp44NKp44). The receptor also binds to viral hemagglutinins from influenza and other viruses, promoting NK cell activation (Pazina2017Regulation; Parodi2019NKp44NKp44). 

Additionally, NKp44 interacts with Platelet-Derived Growth Factor-DD (PDGF-DD), inducing NK cell degranulation and cytokine secretion, which can lead to tumor cell cycle arrest (Barrow2019The). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of NKp44 in modulating immune responses through its engagement with various ligands.
