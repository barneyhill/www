# PRICKLE3

## Overview
PRICKLE3 is a gene that encodes the prickle planar cell polarity protein 3, a crucial component involved in both mitochondrial function and planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling. The protein is characterized by the presence of PET and LIM domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and signal transduction, and a mitochondrial localization signal that directs it to mitochondria. Functionally, prickle planar cell polarity protein 3 is integral to the assembly and stability of ATP synthase, particularly influencing complex V of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, thereby playing a vital role in cellular energy metabolism through oxidative phosphorylation. Additionally, it is involved in PCP, contributing to processes such as basal body organization and ciliogenesis, which are essential for cell polarity and directional movement. Mutations in PRICKLE3 have been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and conditions such as Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), underscoring its clinical significance (Chu2016Prickle3; Radaszkiewicz2023The; Yu2020PRICKLE3).

## Structure
The PRICKLE3 protein is a member of the human PRICKLE gene family, which is involved in planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling. PRICKLE3 contains several key domains, including the PET and LIM domains, which are important for protein-protein interactions and signal transduction (Radaszkiewicz2023The). The PET domain is approximately 110 amino acids long, while the LIM domain is a cysteine-rich module consisting of about 60 amino acids (Radaszkiewicz2023The). 

PRICKLE3 is characterized by a mitochondrial localization signal (MLS) at its N-terminus, which is conserved across vertebrate Prickle3 isoforms, facilitating its mitochondrial localization (Radaszkiewicz2023The). This protein is involved in ATPase biogenesis and interacts specifically with the ATP8 subunit of the ATP synthase complex, suggesting a role in the assembly and stabilization of ATP synthase (Yu2020PRICKLE3). 

The PRICKLE3 protein also contains a central intrinsically disordered region, which can be up to 50% of the total protein length and is often associated with post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation (Radaszkiewicz2023The). These modifications may regulate its function and interactions within the cell. The protein's structure and interactions are crucial for its role in mitochondrial function and PCP signaling.

## Function
PRICKLE3 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in mitochondrial function and planar cell polarity (PCP). In healthy human cells, PRICKLE3 is enriched in mitochondria and plays a crucial role in the assembly and activity of ATP synthase, particularly complex V of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This function is essential for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production, which are vital for cellular energy metabolism (Yu2020PRICKLE3).

PRICKLE3 interacts with components of ATP synthase, such as ATP8, and is involved in the stability and assembly of this complex. Mutations in PRICKLE3 can lead to decreased ATP synthase activity, affecting mitochondrial ATP production and potentially leading to mitochondrial dysfunction (Yu2020PRICKLE3).

Beyond its mitochondrial role, PRICKLE3 is also implicated in PCP, a process crucial for establishing cell polarity and directional cell movement. It is involved in basal body organization and ciliogenesis, interacting with proteins like Vangl2 and Wtip to regulate cilia growth and positioning. This function is important for proper cellular structure and function, influencing processes such as embryonic development and tissue morphogenesis (Chu2016Prickle3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PRICKLE3 gene have been implicated in Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), a condition characterized by optic nerve dysfunction and vision loss. A specific mutation, c.157C>T (p.Arg53Trp), has been identified as a nuclear modifier that exacerbates mitochondrial dysfunction when present alongside the m.11778G>A mitochondrial DNA mutation. This combination leads to increased penetrance and expressivity of LHON, resulting in a higher incidence and earlier onset of optic neuropathy in affected individuals (Yu2020PRICKLE3). The p.Arg53Trp mutation affects the stability and activity of mitochondrial complex V, a component of ATP synthase, leading to reduced ATP production and contributing to the pathogenesis of LHON (Yu2020PRICKLE3).

In addition to its role in LHON, PRICKLE3 mutations have been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, which may contribute to other conditions. The gene's involvement in ATPase biogenesis and its interaction with ATP synthase components suggest that alterations in PRICKLE3 can lead to broader mitochondrial deficiencies (Yu2020PRICKLE3). While the full spectrum of diseases linked to PRICKLE3 mutations is not yet fully understood, its role in mitochondrial function and cellular signaling highlights its clinical significance.

## Interactions
PRICKLE3, a member of the prickle planar cell polarity protein family, is involved in several critical protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with Par3 to form apical planar cell polarity (PCP) complexes in the vertebrate neural plate. This interaction is essential for the asymmetric distribution of PCP components and is crucial for neural tube closure (Chuykin2018Par3). PRICKLE3 also interacts with Vangl2, another core PCP protein, to regulate PCP signaling and ciliogenesis. This interaction is facilitated by Par3, which recruits PRICKLE3 to the apical surface, enabling its association with Vangl2 (Chu2016Prickle3; Chuykin2018Par3).

In addition to its role in PCP, PRICKLE3 is involved in mitochondrial function. It specifically binds to the ATP8 subunit of ATP synthase, playing a role in the assembly and stability of the ATP synthase complex. This interaction is crucial for mitochondrial ATP production and is implicated in the pathogenesis of Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) (Yu2020PRICKLE3). These interactions highlight the multifaceted roles of PRICKLE3 in both cellular polarity and mitochondrial function.
