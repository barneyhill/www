# ANKRD30B

## Overview
ANKRD30B is a gene that encodes the ankyrin repeat domain 30B protein, which is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat motifs. These motifs are known for mediating protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the ankyrin repeat domain 30B protein may play a role in various cellular processes through its interaction with other proteins. The gene is highly conserved among higher primates, indicating its potential importance in specific brain functions. ANKRD30B has been implicated in several neuropsychiatric conditions, including Williams Syndrome and Alzheimer's disease, where it is often found to be hypermethylated and downregulated, particularly in brain regions associated with cognitive and social functions (Kimura2020Integrated).

## Clinical Significance
The ANKRD30B gene has been implicated in Williams Syndrome (WS), a genetic disorder characterized by developmental delays and distinctive facial features. Research indicates that ANKRD30B is significantly hypermethylated in WS patients, particularly at promoter sites cg13266435 and cg21293934, which may lead to downregulation of gene expression (Kimura2020Integrated). This hypermethylation is associated with neuropsychiatric phenotypes observed in WS, as ANKRD30B expression is notably reduced in the frontal cortex of WS patients compared to controls (Kimura2020Integrated). The gene's methylation state in blood samples correlates with brain regions involved in social function, such as the prefrontal cortex and superior temporal gyrus, suggesting a role in the social behavior deficits seen in WS (Kimura2020Integrated).

ANKRD30B is also hypermethylated and downregulated in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients, hinting at a potential link to early cognitive decline in WS (Kimura2020Integrated). The gene is highly conserved in higher primates, indicating its possible critical role in unique brain functions (Kimura2020Integrated). These findings underscore the importance of ANKRD30B in understanding the epigenetic mechanisms underlying WS and related cognitive disorders.
