# DLL4

## Overview
Delta-like canonical Notch ligand 4 (DLL4) is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in the Notch signaling pathway, a critical mechanism for cell communication that influences cell fate decisions, tissue development, and homeostasis. The DLL4 protein is characterized by its extracellular region containing EGF-like domains and a Delta/Serrate/Lag-2 (DSL) domain, which are essential for binding to Notch receptors (Shutter2000Dll4). This interaction is pivotal in processes such as angiogenesis, where DLL4 is expressed in arterial endothelial cells and regulates the formation and maturation of blood vessels (Harrington2008Regulation; Kuhnert2011Dll4Notch). Beyond vascular development, DLL4 also plays a role in T cell differentiation within the thymus (Mohtashami2010Direct). Clinically, alterations in DLL4 expression are implicated in various pathologies, including cancer and pulmonary arterial hypertension, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Awad2024BMPR2; Khelil2021DeltaLike).

## Structure
The DLL4 protein is a member of the Delta family of Notch ligands, characterized by specific structural features. It contains an extracellular region with eight EGF-like domains and a Delta/Serrate/Lag-2 (DSL) domain, which are essential for receptor binding (Shutter2000Dll4). The protein also includes a transmembrane domain and an intracellular domain that lacks catalytic motifs (Yu2019A; Shutter2000Dll4). The EGF-like domains are particularly significant, with several mutations involving cysteine residues affecting these domains (Yu2019A). 

The crystal structure of the NOTCH1-DLL4 complex reveals interactions between NOTCH1 EGF-like repeats 11 and 12 with the DLL4 DSL domain and MNNL domain, respectively (Yu2019A). DLL4 does not have an extracellular cysteine-rich domain or insertions between the EGF-like repeats, distinguishing it from the Jagged family of ligands (Shutter2000Dll4). Post-translational modifications of DLL4 include glycosylation, which is common among proteins involved in the Notch signaling pathway. The gene is located on human chromosome 15q21.1 (Shutter2000Dll4). Information on secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, specific folds, or splice variant isoforms is not provided in the available context.

## Function
DLL4 (Delta-like canonical Notch ligand 4) is a critical component of the Notch signaling pathway, which regulates various cellular processes such as cell fate specification, tissue patterning, and morphogenesis. In healthy human cells, DLL4 is primarily involved in angiogenesis, the process of forming new blood vessels. It is expressed in endothelial cells, particularly in arterial endothelial cells, and plays a significant role in vascular development and homeostasis (Harrington2008Regulation; Kuhnert2011Dll4Notch).

DLL4 functions by interacting with Notch receptors on adjacent cells, leading to the release of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which translocates to the nucleus to influence gene transcription. This signaling is crucial for the specification of endothelial cells into tip and stalk cells during angiogenic sprouting. DLL4 is induced in endothelial tip cells in response to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and activates Notch signaling in adjacent stalk cells, repressing tip cell phenotypes and ensuring proper vessel maturation and remodeling (Kuhnert2011Dll4Notch).

In addition to its role in angiogenesis, DLL4 is involved in T cell development within the thymus, where it supports T lineage differentiation and inhibits B and myeloid lineage development (Mohtashami2010Direct).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the DLL4 gene have significant clinical implications in various diseases. In pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a reduction in DLL4 expression is observed in BMPR2-silenced pulmonary arterial endothelial cells and lung tissues from patients with hereditary and idiopathic PAH. This reduction disrupts DLL4/NOTCH1 signaling, leading to endothelial dysfunction and vascular remodeling, which are key features of PAH pathogenesis (Awad2024BMPR2).

In cancer, high DLL4 expression is associated with poor prognosis and increased tumor aggressiveness. In cervical cancer, DLL4 expression is modulated by HPV16 E6, promoting squamous cell proliferation and correlating with shorter disease-free and disease-specific survival (Khelil2021DeltaLike). DLL4 also plays a role in tumor angiogenesis, with high expression levels linked to reduced survival times in cancers such as clear cell renal cell carcinoma, lung cancer, and breast cancer (BrzozowaZasada2021The).

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), DLL4 acts as a potent stimulator of Notch signaling in NOTCH1-mutated cells, enhancing proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. Targeting DLL4-Notch1 interactions presents a potential therapeutic strategy for CLL, particularly in high-risk cases with NOTCH1 mutations (LópezGuerra2019Specific).

## Interactions
DLL4 (Delta-like canonical Notch ligand 4) is a crucial component of the Notch signaling pathway, interacting primarily with Notch1 and Notch4 receptors. This interaction is essential for processes such as angiogenesis and vascular development. DLL4 binds to the Notch1 receptor, leading to its proteolytic cleavage and the release of the Notch intracellular domain, which translocates to the nucleus to regulate gene expression (Jenkins2012MEDI0639:).

The therapeutic antibody MEDI0639 targets DLL4, inhibiting its interaction with the Notch1 receptor. This inhibition affects endothelial cell function and angiogenesis by preventing the cleavage of Notch1, thereby modulating endothelial signaling and promoting the formation of tip cells (Jenkins2012MEDI0639:).

DLL4 also interacts with the protein MPDZ, which enhances Notch signaling by facilitating the presentation of DLL4 at the cell surface. MPDZ recruits DLL4 to the adherens junction protein Nectin-2, stabilizing its cell surface localization and promoting Notch signaling activity. This interaction is crucial for regulating angiogenesis and preventing excessive vessel branching (Tetzlaff2018MPDZ).

In the context of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), DLL4 interacts with the Notch1 signaling pathway, inducing proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis in NOTCH1-mutated CLL cells. This interaction is linked to aggressive tumor processes (LópezGuerra2019Specific).
