# PIP4P2

## Overview
PIP4P2 is a gene that encodes the enzyme phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 4-phosphatase 2, which plays a crucial role in phosphoinositide metabolism. This enzyme is categorized as a phosphatase and is involved in the conversion of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) to phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate (PI(5)P), a process significant for various cellular functions, including cell signaling and membrane dynamics. PIP4P2 has been implicated in cellular processes such as cell-cell adhesion and lysosomal health, with potential links to neurodegenerative diseases due to its role in lysosomal dynamics (Daly2023Multiomic; Stehle2024Human). The enzyme's activity is also associated with cellular stress responses and growth factor signaling, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Rameh202325).

## Structure


## Interactions
PIP4P2, also known as phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 4-phosphatase 2, is involved in phosphoinositide metabolism and interacts with various proteins in cellular processes. It has been identified as an interactor of CRB proteins, specifically CRB1 and CRB2, in HEK293T cells and porcine retinal lysate. These interactions suggest a role in cell-cell adhesion and phosphoinositide metabolism, particularly in the conversion of PI(4,5)P2 to PI(5)P (Stehle2024Human).

PIP4P2 is also implicated in the regulation of lysosomal health, as observed in studies involving the Retromer complex. A decrease in PIP4P2 was noted in VPS35 knockout lysosomes, which affects lysosomal reformation and nutrient sensing, indicating its involvement in lysosomal dynamics and potentially in neurodegenerative diseases (Daly2023Multiomic).

Additionally, PIP4P2 is involved in the synthesis and regulation of PI5P, with its activity being linked to cellular stress responses and growth factor signaling. The enzyme's role in generating PI5P in vitro has been documented, although its in vivo activity remains less understood (Rameh202325).
