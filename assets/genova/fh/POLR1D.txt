# POLR1D

## Overview
The POLR1D gene encodes the RNA polymerase I and III subunit D, a protein that plays a critical role in the transcription machinery of eukaryotic cells. This protein is a component of both RNA polymerase I and III complexes, which are responsible for the synthesis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and small RNAs, respectively. These processes are essential for ribosome biogenesis and, consequently, for protein synthesis and cell proliferation (Miao2020Loss; Wang2019POLR1D). POLR1D is particularly significant in the context of embryonic development, where it is crucial for the formation of craniofacial structures derived from neural crest cells (Giampietro2014Whole). Mutations in the POLR1D gene have been linked to Treacher Collins syndrome, a disorder characterized by craniofacial abnormalities, underscoring its importance in developmental biology and clinical genetics (Schaefer2014Autosomal; Noack2016The).

## Function
The POLR1D gene encodes a subunit shared by RNA polymerases I and III, which are essential for the synthesis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and small RNAs, respectively. These polymerases play a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis, a process vital for protein synthesis and cell proliferation (Miao2020Loss; Wang2019POLR1D). In healthy human cells, POLR1D is active in the nucleolus, where it contributes to the assembly and stability of the polymerase complexes, impacting cell growth and proliferation (Wang2019POLR1D).

POLR1D is particularly important for maintaining the level of ribosomal activity necessary for the proper development of craniofacial structures derived from neural crest cells. This function is critical during embryonic development, specifically in the formation of craniofacial structures between weeks 3 and 8 (Giampietro2014Whole). Deficiency in POLR1D can lead to apoptosis of derivatives of the first and second branchial arches, highlighting its role in craniofacial development (Giampietro2014Whole).

In addition to its role in development, POLR1D is involved in cell cycle regulation and is necessary for early preimplantation development in mammals, as demonstrated by studies in mice (Miao2020Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the POLR1D gene are associated with Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS), a congenital disorder characterized by craniofacial deformities such as hypoplasia of facial bones, downward slanting of palpebral fissures, and ear malformations leading to hearing loss (Schaefer2014Autosomal). These mutations can be inherited in both autosomal dominant and recessive patterns, although they account for a smaller percentage of TCS cases compared to mutations in the TCOF1 gene (Schaefer2014Autosomal; Noack2016The).

Research has shown that POLR1D mutations disrupt ribosomal RNA transcription and ribosome biogenesis, leading to increased apoptosis of neural crest cells, which are crucial for craniofacial development (Noack2016The). This disruption results in cranioskeletal anomalies, as demonstrated in zebrafish models, which exhibit similar craniofacial defects to those seen in TCS patients (Noack2016The).

In a study involving a family with Klippel–Feil and Treacher Collins syndromes, a novel POLR1D variant was identified, suggesting a potential link between these conditions and highlighting the gene's role in skeletal phenotypes (Giampietro2014Whole). This underscores the genetic heterogeneity and complexity of disorders associated with POLR1D mutations.
