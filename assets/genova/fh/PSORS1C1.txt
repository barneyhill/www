# PSORS1C1

## Overview
The PSORS1C1 gene encodes the protein psoriasis susceptibility 1 candidate 1, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory skin condition. This gene is located within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region on chromosome 6, a locus known for its strong association with autoimmune diseases. The protein encoded by PSORS1C1 is involved in immune system regulation, although its precise biological function remains to be fully elucidated. Variants within the PSORS1C1 gene, particularly single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), have been linked to both the risk and severity of psoriasis, as well as other autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (Ciccacci2016Polymorphisms; Wiśniewski2018HLAC*06:02independent). The gene's role in modulating immune responses highlights its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in psoriasis and related disorders.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The PSORS1C1 gene is associated with the risk and severity of psoriasis, particularly in early-onset cases. Specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within this gene, such as rs1062470, have been linked to increased psoriasis risk. This SNP, located in the first intron of PSORS1C1 and the second exon of the CDSN gene, affects the stability of CDSN mRNA, potentially influencing psoriasis pathogenesis (Wiśniewski2018HLAC*06:02independent). The minor alleles of rs1062470 and other SNPs like rs2894207 and rs10484554 significantly increase the risk of psoriasis, with odds ratios of 2.17, 2.33, and 2.68, respectively (Wiśniewski2018HLAC*06:02independent).

Gender-specific effects have also been observed, with the rs887466A allele providing a protective effect against psoriasis in males but not females (Wiśniewski2018HLAC*06:02independent). In males, the rs1062470 SNP is correlated with higher Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) scores, indicating a potential role in disease severity (Wiśniewski2018HLAC*06:02independent).

In addition to psoriasis, the PSORS1C1 gene has been implicated in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The rs2233945 SNP in PSORS1C1 is associated with a reduced risk of bone erosions in RA patients, suggesting a protective role in joint damage (Ciccacci2016Polymorphisms). However, the role of PSORS1C1 in RA requires further investigation due to limited data (Ciccacci2016Polymorphisms).
