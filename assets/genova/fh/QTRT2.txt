# QTRT2

## Overview
QTRT2 is a gene that encodes the queuine tRNA-ribosyltransferase accessory subunit 2, a non-catalytic component of the eukaryotic tRNA guanine transglycosylase (TGT) complex. This protein plays a pivotal role in the post-transcriptional modification of tRNA by facilitating the incorporation of queuine, a modified nucleobase, into specific tRNAs. Although QTRT2 itself is not catalytically active, it is essential for the structural integrity and function of the TGT complex, primarily through its role in RNA binding and dimerization with the catalytically active subunit QTRT1. The protein's structure includes unique features such as a two-stranded βEβF-sheet that serves as an additional RNA-binding motif, highlighting its regulatory role in tRNA substrate recognition (Sievers2021Structural). The activity of the TGT complex, including QTRT2, is crucial for various biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and metabolism, and has implications in clinical conditions such as cancer and neurological disorders (Rashad2024Translational; Fergus2021The).

## Structure
The QTRT2 protein, part of the human tRNA guanine transglycosylase (TGT) complex, is a non-catalytic subunit that plays a crucial role in RNA binding. Its structure is characterized by the absence of helix αA and β-sheet βD, with a flexible region encompassing residues 108 to 121. The βEβF-sheet is angled towards the center of the subunit and serves as an additional RNA-binding motif, interacting with the tRNA's D-arm (Sievers2021Structural). 

QTRT2 also features a small helix, α4a, spanning residues 148-151, which interacts with the RNA phosphate backbone. A 30-residue insertion in QTRT2 lacks electron density, indicating flexibility, and may play a role in orienting substrate RNA or anchoring the enzyme in cells (Sievers2021Structural). 

The dimer interface between QTRT1 and QTRT2 is formed by helix-turn-helix and loop-helix motifs, with aromatic hot spots contributing to stability. These hot spots include residues such as F95, H366, Y363, and H359, which are crucial for dimer stability (Sebastiani2022Structural; Sievers2021Structural).

## Function
The QTRT2 gene encodes the queuine tRNA-ribosyltransferase accessory subunit 2, which is part of the eukaryotic tRNA guanine transglycosylase (TGT) complex. This complex is responsible for the incorporation of queuine, a modified nucleobase, into specific tRNAs, replacing guanine at the wobble position of GUN anticodons. This modification is crucial for enhancing translational efficiency and accuracy (Yuan2019Discovery; Sievers2021Structural).

QTRT2 forms a heterodimer with the catalytically active subunit QTRT1. While QTRT2 itself is catalytically inactive, it plays a significant role in RNA binding, contributing to the structural integrity and function of the TGT complex. It contains a two-stranded βEβF-sheet that acts as an additional RNA-binding motif, suggesting a regulatory role in tRNA substrate recognition (Sievers2021Structural).

The activity of the TGT complex, including QTRT2, is essential for various biological processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and metabolism. It is active in the cytoplasm and potentially influences mitochondrial tRNA modifications, impacting cellular homeostasis and efficient protein synthesis (Rashad2024Translational; Fergus2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the QTRT2 gene, which encodes the queuine tRNA-ribosyltransferase accessory subunit 2, have been implicated in various diseases. Disruptions in queuosine modification, potentially involving QTRT2, have been linked to cancer development. Reduced queuosine content has been observed in several cancers, suggesting a role for QTRT2 in tumorigenic processes (Janin2020Disruption). Alterations in QTRT2 expression or function have also been associated with multiple sclerosis, as the absence of queuosine due to reduced activity of tRNA guanine transglycosylase (TRT) or promoter methylation of QTRT2 has been linked to this condition (Shaukat2021Mitochondrial). 

The loss of tRNA queuosine (tRNA-Q) due to QTRT2 knockout leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and translational dysregulation, impacting mitochondrial-related pathways. This dysfunction is associated with metabolic alterations, although it does not affect cellular proliferation (Rashad2024Translational). The absence of Q-tRNA modification has been linked to learning and memory deficits, with more pronounced effects in female mice, suggesting potential sex-specific impacts on neurobiology (Lv2024tRNA). These findings highlight the clinical significance of QTRT2 in maintaining cellular and neurological health.

## Interactions
The QTRT2 protein, a non-catalytic subunit of the human tRNA guanine transglycosylase (TGT) complex, plays a crucial role in RNA binding and dimerization with QTRT1. Although QTRT2 is catalytically inactive, it contributes to the structural integrity and function of the TGT complex by forming a heterodimer with the catalytically active QTRT1 subunit. This interaction is facilitated by specific residues at the dimer interface, such as QTRT2 Y354, which forms a bond with the main-chain amide of QTRT1 E60, and QTRT2 N358, which binds QTRT1 N97 (Sievers2021Structural).

QTRT2 also interacts with tRNA, primarily through a positively charged patch and a βEβF-sheet, which are potential sites for tRNA interaction. The positively charged patch, formed by helices α4a and α4b, is suggested to bind the acceptor stem of tRNA via its phosphate backbone, while the βEβF-sheet is positioned to form hydrogen bonds and Van der Waals interactions with the tRNA's D-arm (Sievers2021Structural). Mutagenesis studies have shown that mutations in these regions can affect tRNA binding affinity and enzyme activity, highlighting the importance of these interactions in the function of the TGT complex (Sievers2021Structural).
