# CNNM4

## Overview
CNNM4 is a gene that encodes the protein cyclin and CBS domain divalent metal cation transport mediator 4, which is integral to the transport of magnesium ions across cell membranes. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein and plays a pivotal role in maintaining magnesium homeostasis within human cells. CNNM4 functions primarily as a Na+/Mg2+ exchanger, facilitating the extrusion of magnesium ions from cells in exchange for sodium ions, a process crucial for regulating intracellular magnesium levels, particularly in epithelial tissues of the intestine and kidney (Funato2018Molecular). The protein's structure includes distinct domains such as the CBS-pair domain and the CNBH domain, which are essential for its function and interaction with other proteins like the TRPM7 channel (Chen2020Mg2+ATP; Bai2021CNNM). Mutations in the CNNM4 gene are associated with Jalili syndrome, a condition characterized by cone-rod dystrophy and amelogenesis imperfecta, underscoring the gene's clinical significance (Daneshmandpour2019Features; Parry2009Mutations).

## Structure
The CNNM4 protein is an integral membrane protein involved in magnesium transport, characterized by several distinct structural domains. It contains a transmembrane domain known as DUF21, which consists of three transmembrane-spanning helices and a short re-entrant loop between helices 1 and 2 (Franken2022Structural). The protein also features a large cytosolic region that includes a CBS-pair domain and a CNBH domain. The CBS-pair domain is composed of two cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) motifs that form a dimeric structure, crucial for Mg2+-ATP binding and subsequent conformational changes necessary for its function (Chen2020Mg2+ATP).

The CNBH domain, although structurally similar to cyclic nucleotide-binding domains, does not bind cyclic nucleotides. Instead, it promotes dimerization of the CBS-pair domain, enhancing Mg2+-ATP binding affinity (Chen2020Mg2+ATP). The protein undergoes glycosylation, a post-translational modification that occurs in the Golgi apparatus, which is mediated by ARL15 and is essential for its targeting to the plasma membrane (Franken2022Structural; Bai2021CNNM). CNNM4's structure and function are influenced by its interaction with other proteins, such as the TRPM7 channel and metal chaperone COX11, which may play roles in its regulatory mechanisms (Parry2009Mutations; Bai2021CNNM).

## Function
The CNNM4 gene encodes a protein that is integral to magnesium (Mg2+) transport across cell membranes, playing a crucial role in maintaining Mg2+ homeostasis in human cells. CNNM4 functions primarily as a Na+/Mg2+ exchanger, extruding Mg2+ from cells by exchanging intracellular Mg2+ with extracellular Na+. This activity is essential for regulating intracellular Mg2+ levels, particularly in epithelial tissues of the intestine and kidney, where it facilitates Mg2+ absorption and reabsorption (Funato2018Molecular).

CNNM4 is predominantly expressed in the brain, bone marrow, immune system, and intestinal tract, with significant activity at the basolateral membrane of intestinal epithelial cells. This localization is crucial for its role in Mg2+ transport and homeostasis (GiménezMascarell2019Structural; Funato2018Molecular). The protein's structure includes a Bateman module and a cyclic nucleotide binding-like domain, which are involved in ATP and Mg2+ binding, facilitating conformational changes that regulate its transport activity (GiménezMascarell2019Structural).

CNNM4 also interacts with the TRPM7 channel, influencing the entry of divalent cations like Mg2+ into cells, which is vital for cellular functions such as proliferation and differentiation (Bai2021CNNM). Its dysfunction is linked to conditions like Jalili Syndrome and hereditary hypomagnesemia, highlighting its importance in normal physiological processes (GiménezMascarell2019Structural; Funato2018Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CNNM4 gene are linked to Jalili syndrome, a rare autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by cone-rod dystrophy (CRD) and amelogenesis imperfecta (AI). This condition results from various mutations, including missense mutations, terminations, and large deletions, which affect the gene's function in metal ion transport, particularly magnesium (Mg2+) (Daneshmandpour2019Features; Parry2009Mutations). The dysfunction in CNNM4 leads to impaired Mg2+ extrusion, contributing to the mineralization defects observed in dental enamel and retinal degeneration (Luder2013Dental; Yamazaki2013Basolateral).

Patients with Jalili syndrome experience vision problems such as nystagmus, photophobia, and progressive vision loss, alongside dental issues like enamel hypoplasia and increased susceptibility to cavities (Daneshmandpour2019Features; Luder2013Dental). The condition has been reported globally, with a higher prevalence in the Middle East and North Africa (Daneshmandpour2019Features). In some cases, additional symptoms such as developmental delay and spastic diplegia have been observed, potentially due to other genetic factors (Prasov2020Expanding). The identification of CNNM4 mutations has expanded the understanding of the genetic basis of Jalili syndrome and its phenotypic variability (Prasov2020Expanding).

## Interactions
CNNM4 interacts with phosphatases of the regenerating liver (PRLs), particularly through its CBS2 motif and the catalytic cavity of PRL. This interaction results in structural modifications in both proteins, leading to the closure of PRL's catalytic cavity and inhibition of phosphatase activity. Electrostatic attraction between surface residues of CNNM4 and PRL causes displacement of CNNM4's CBS1 motifs, resulting in a flattening of the CBS module, which is also influenced by MgATP binding (GiménezMascarell2019Structural).

CNNM4 also interacts with the TRPM7 ion channel, forming a complex that facilitates the entry of divalent cations like Mg2+ and Zn2+ into cells. This interaction is crucial for TRPM7 channel activity, as the absence of CNNM4 significantly reduces TRPM7-mediated cation entry. CNNM4's interaction with TRPM7 is specific, as it does not interact with other TRP channels like TRPM2 (Bai2021CNNM).

In epithelial cells, CNNM4's basolateral sorting is mediated by interactions with clathrin adaptor protein complexes AP-1A and AP-1B. These interactions involve specific motifs in CNNM4, such as tyrosine-based and dileucine motifs, which are recognized by the adaptor proteins (Hirata2014Basolateral).
