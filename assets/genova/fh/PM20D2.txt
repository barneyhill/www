# PM20D2

## Overview
PM20D2 is a gene that encodes the protein peptidase M20 domain containing 2, which is a member of the M20 peptidase family. This protein is involved in proteolytic processes crucial for protein metabolism and regulation. It is primarily active in cellular compartments responsible for protein degradation and processing, thereby influencing cellular homeostasis and metabolic pathways (Mathur2011Evolutionary). The gene has been implicated in metabolic conditions such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, with evidence suggesting its overexpression in obese individuals, particularly females, compared to those with type 2 diabetes (Moldovan2024Transcriptomic). Additionally, PM20D2 may play a role in immune response networks, although its specific functions in this context remain to be fully elucidated (Aruna2023Association).

## Structure


## Function
PM20D2 (peptidase M20 domain containing 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in proteolytic processes, which are essential for protein metabolism and regulation. The protein is part of the M20 peptidase family, typically associated with amino acid metabolism. PM20D2 is active in cellular compartments where protein degradation and processing occur, influencing cellular homeostasis and metabolic pathways (Mathur2011Evolutionary).

In the context of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D), PM20D2 has been identified as overexpressed in obese samples compared to T2D counterparts, particularly in females. This suggests a role in adipose tissue metabolism, where it participates in protein metabolism (Moldovan2024Transcriptomic). The gene's involvement in metabolic processes is further supported by its upregulation in Ano5 knockout mice, indicating its importance in metabolism, particularly in skeletal muscles (Xu2015Genetic).

PM20D2 is also mentioned in the context of immune response, being part of a network of genes associated with immune responses, although its specific function in this context is not detailed (Aruna2023Association). Overall, PM20D2 plays a significant role in metabolic and possibly immune processes, contributing to the regulation of protein and amino acid metabolism in various tissues.
