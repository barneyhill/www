# FAM219B

## Overview
FAM219B is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 219 member B. This protein is part of a broader family characterized by shared sequence motifs, although its specific biological functions remain largely undefined. The FAM219B protein is not currently categorized into well-known protein classes such as kinases or receptors, and its role in cellular processes is still under investigation. Research has suggested potential implications of FAM219B in various diseases, including colorectal cancer and osteoarthritis, although its precise contributions to these conditions are not yet fully understood (Baruah2022Gametheoretic; Rice2019Discovery). Further studies are needed to elucidate the functional roles and clinical significance of FAM219B in human health and disease.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The FAM219B gene has been identified as a potential biomarker in colorectal cancer (CRC) through a game-theoretic approach, although its specific role in CRC remains underexplored. The study by Baruah et al. found that higher expression levels of FAM219B are associated with reduced survival probability in CRC patients, suggesting a possible link to disease progression (Baruah2022Gametheoretic). Despite this association, there is currently no substantial evidence indicating the involvement of FAM219B in CRC or other cancer types, highlighting the novelty of these findings and the need for further research to establish its clinical significance (Baruah2022Gametheoretic).

In addition to its potential role in CRC, FAM219B has been mentioned in the context of osteoarthritis (OA) research. It is one of the genes expressed in cartilage, although no differential expression was observed between OA and non-OA cartilage, indicating a lack of direct association with OA risk (Rice2019Discovery). Furthermore, FAM219B was identified in a study on systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but its specific clinical significance in SLE remains unclear (Su2020Mapping). Overall, the clinical implications of FAM219B are still being investigated, with current studies suggesting potential but unconfirmed roles in various conditions.
