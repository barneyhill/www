# ATG9B

## Overview
ATG9B is a gene that encodes the autophagy-related protein 9B, a transmembrane protein integral to the autophagy process. Autophagy is a critical cellular mechanism for degrading and recycling cytoplasmic components, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis. The ATG9B protein is essential for the formation of autophagosomes, vesicular structures that transport cellular debris to lysosomes for degradation. It plays a pivotal role in cellular stress responses and the turnover of damaged organelles and protein aggregates. ATG9B is involved in various cellular signaling pathways, including the p38α mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, and is particularly important in cardiac tissues for maintaining mitochondrial health. Additionally, ATG9B has been implicated in cancer pathogenesis, with its expression and interactions influencing cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis (Zhong2021MYH9dependent; Liang2020Aging).

## Function
ATG9B is a transmembrane protein integral to the autophagy process, specifically in the formation of autophagosomes. Autophagy is a cellular degradation pathway that maintains intracellular homeostasis by recycling cytoplasmic components. In healthy human cells, ATG9B is crucial for delivering membrane material to the expanding phagophore, a precursor to the autophagosome, thereby facilitating the formation of these vesicles that transport cellular debris to lysosomes for degradation (Liang2020Aging).

ATG9B is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to cellular stress by regulating autophagic activity. It plays a significant role in the turnover of damaged organelles and protein aggregates, which is essential for cellular health and function (Liang2020Aging). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and is regulated by pathways such as the p38α mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, indicating its involvement in broader cellular signaling networks (Zhong2021MYH9dependent).

In the context of cardiac tissues, ATG9B is particularly important for maintaining mitochondrial health and preventing the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria, which is crucial for the proper functioning of the heart (Liang2020Aging).

## Clinical Significance
ATG9B has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in autophagy and cellular processes. In gastric and colorectal cancers with high microsatellite instability (MSI-H), frameshift mutations in ATG9B lead to premature stops in amino acid synthesis, suggesting a loss-of-function that may inactivate autophagy functions. These mutations are associated with MSI-H cancers, indicating a potential role in cancer pathogenesis through autophagy deregulation (Kang2009Frameshift).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), high expression of ATG9B is linked to increased metastasis, advanced stages, and poor prognosis. ATG9B enhances CRC cell migration and invasion by interacting with MYH9, promoting focal adhesion assembly and integrin β1 activation. This interaction is crucial for CRC metastasis and suggests that ATG9B could serve as a biomarker for predicting metastasis risk and poor prognosis (Zhong2021MYH9dependent).

In breast cancer, particularly invasive ductal carcinomas, ATG9B shows high promoter methylation, leading to decreased mRNA expression. This epigenetic modification is associated with tumor progression and may serve as a marker for early diagnosis and treatment strategies (Zhang2016Aberrant).

## Interactions
ATG9B is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in autophagy and cancer metastasis. In the context of autophagy, ATG9B interacts with LC3, a protein associated with autophagosome membranes. This interaction is mediated by ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) on ATG9B, which bind to the ubiquitin-interacting motif docking site (UDS) on LC3. This binding is essential for the localization of ATG9B to the autophagosomal membrane, playing a significant role in autophagosome formation (Zhang2020Mammalian).

In colorectal cancer metastasis, ATG9B interacts with MYH9, a protein that enhances its stability by reducing ubiquitin-mediated degradation. This interaction occurs at the cytoplasmic peptide segments aa368-411 of ATG9B and is crucial for focal adhesion assembly, which is important for cancer cell invasion. MYH9 assists in transporting ATG9B to the cell edge, facilitating the activation and polarization of integrin β1, a process necessary for focal adhesion formation (Zhong2021MYH9dependent). The interaction between ATG9B and MYH9 also involves the inhibition of STUB1-mediated ubiquitination, further stabilizing both proteins (Zhong2021MYH9dependent).
