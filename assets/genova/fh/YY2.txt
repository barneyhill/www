# YY2

## Overview
YY2, or Yin Yang 2, is a gene that encodes the YY2 transcription factor, a member of the GLI-Krüppel family of transcription factors. This protein is characterized by its four C2H2 zinc finger domains, which are essential for its DNA-binding capabilities (Li2020Biological; Figiel2019The). The YY2 transcription factor is involved in the regulation of gene expression, functioning as both an activator and repressor depending on the cellular context. It shares significant structural and functional similarities with its paralog, YY1, yet it also possesses distinct regulatory roles, such as the activation of p53 transcription (Li2020Biological; Nguyen2004Molecular). YY2 is expressed in various tissues and plays a critical role in embryonic development, cell cycle regulation, and cellular differentiation (Li2020Biological). Clinically, alterations in YY2 expression are associated with cancer, where it acts as a tumor suppressor, influencing tumor cell proliferation and chromosomal stability (Li2020Biological; Hosea2023YY2BUB3).

## Structure
The YY2 transcription factor is a protein with a structure that includes four C2H2 zinc finger domains, which are crucial for its DNA-binding capability. These zinc fingers are located in the C-terminal region and are highly conserved, sharing 86% identity with those in its paralog, YY1 (Li2020Biological; Figiel2019The). The primary structure of YY2 consists of 378 amino acids, and it is classified within the GLI-Krüppel family of transcription factors (Li2020Biological).

In terms of secondary structure, YY2 contains significant amounts of alpha-helices and beta-sheets, as indicated by circular dichroism (CD) spectra (Figiel2019The). The tertiary structure of YY2 is more ordered compared to YY1, with a tendency towards a compact conformation, as suggested by its hydrodynamic properties and proteolytic resistance (Figiel2019The). The N-terminal region of YY2 is more stable and ordered than that of YY1, which may contribute to its unique regulatory functions (Li2020Biological).

YY2 lacks the acidic-rich domain present in YY1, which affects its transcriptional activation capacity (Li2020Biological). The protein's structure is influenced by post-translational modifications, such as methylation, which can alter its DNA-binding activity (Li2020Biological).

## Function
YY2, or Yin Yang 2, is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in gene regulation within healthy human cells. It is involved in both transcriptional activation and repression, influencing the expression of various genes such as c-Myc, c-Fos, and CXCR4 (Nguyen2004Molecular). YY2 shares a high degree of similarity with its paralog YY1, particularly in the zinc finger regions, allowing it to bind to similar DNA sequences and regulate some of the same promoters (Nguyen2004Molecular). However, YY2 also has unique regulatory roles, such as activating p53 transcription, which contrasts with YY1's role in facilitating p53 degradation (Li2020Biological).

YY2 is expressed in various tissues, including the cardiovascular and nervous systems, and is crucial for embryonic development, particularly in maintaining stemness and directing differentiation of embryonic stem cells (Li2020Biological). It is also involved in cell cycle regulation and cell proliferation, with its activity being modulated by post-translational modifications like lysine 247 monomethylation (Wu2017Methylation). This methylation affects YY2's DNA-binding activity and its role in chromatin association, influencing gene expression and cellular processes such as tumor growth (Wu2017Methylation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the YY2 transcription factor have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. YY2 is identified as a tumor suppressor gene, and its aberrant expression is linked to various cancers, including colorectal, breast, colon, and liver carcinomas. Down-regulation of YY2 is associated with increased tumor cell proliferation and metastasis, as it affects cell cycle progression and enhances p53 transcription, which in turn increases p21 expression (Li2020Biological).

In colorectal cancer, YY2 overexpression prolongs mitosis and enhances spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) activity, leading to tumor suppression by reducing cell proliferation and increasing cell death. Conversely, YY2 knockout results in higher cell viability and proliferation, indicating its role in tumor cell fate through chromosomal instability (Hosea2023YY2BUB3).

YY2 also plays a role in chromosomal instability (CIN), where both its overexpression and knockout can induce CIN, affecting tumor cell behavior and drug resistance. Excessive CIN, often resulting from YY2 overexpression, sensitizes tumor cells to DNA damage-inducing agents, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment (Hosea2023YY2BUB3). These findings highlight the complex role of YY2 in cancer progression and treatment response.

## Interactions
YY2, a transcription factor, participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, influencing gene regulation. It shares significant sequence similarity with YY1, particularly in the zinc finger regions, which are crucial for DNA binding. YY2 can bind specifically to a YY1-consensus sequence, although it does not interact with all promoters that YY1 does (Nguyen2004Molecular). YY2's DNA-binding activity is influenced by methylation at the K247 site, mediated by SET7/9, which enhances its binding affinity to gene promoters, while demethylation by LSD1 reduces this binding (Wu2017Methylation). 

YY2 can form specific protein-DNA complexes, as confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), and interacts with promoters containing YY1-binding sites, such as those for p53, c-Myc, and c-Fos (Nguyen2004Molecular). It also competes with YY1 for binding sites, influencing transcriptional regulation, as seen in the context of the beta interferon promoter, where YY2 can reduce the negative effect of YY1 when both are co-expressed (Klar2005Enhanceosome). These interactions suggest that YY2 plays a complex role in gene regulation, potentially acting as both an activator and repressor depending on the context.
