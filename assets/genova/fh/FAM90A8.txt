# FAM90A8

## Overview
FAM90A8 is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 90, member A8. This protein is part of a larger family characterized by shared sequence motifs, although the specific functional role of FAM90A8 within this family remains to be fully elucidated. Proteins in this family are often involved in various cellular processes, but FAM90A8's precise biological functions and interactions are still under investigation. The gene is located on chromosome 8, and its expression patterns and potential involvement in disease pathways are subjects of ongoing research. Understanding the role of FAM90A8 could provide insights into its contribution to cellular mechanisms and its potential implications in human health and disease.
