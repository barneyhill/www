# CCDC28A

## Overview
CCDC28A is a gene that encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 28A protein, which is characterized by a coiled-coil domain and is involved in various cellular processes. The protein is primarily known for its role in hematopoietic development and male fertility, where it is enriched in hematopoietic stem cells and is crucial for sperm morphology and motility (Petit2011Functional; Zhou2024CCDC28A). CCDC28A interacts with proteins such as SPACA1 and GSK3A, which are essential for acrosome assembly and sperm head formation, highlighting its importance in reproductive health (Zhou2024CCDC28A). Additionally, CCDC28A has been implicated in the formation of a fusion protein with NUP98, which is associated with malignant myeloproliferative tumors, suggesting a potential role in tumorigenesis (Zhou2024CCDC28A). The protein's subcellular localization in both the cytoplasm and nucleus indicates its involvement in nuclear-cytoplasmic transport or signaling (Petit2011Functional).

## Structure
The CCDC28A gene encodes a protein characterized by a coiled-coil (CC) domain, which is approximately 100 amino acids long and is a common feature among several NUP98 partner proteins (Petit2011Functional). The predicted protein has two isoforms: a 'short' isoform consisting of 184 amino acids and a 'long' isoform of 274 amino acids. The last 184 amino acids of the protein are well conserved across vertebrates, suggesting functional importance, while the first 90 N-terminal amino acids are poorly conserved and contain a globular domain with strong hydrophobic amino acids (Petit2011Functional).

The CCDC28A protein does not have any well-characterized motifs apart from the coiled-coil domain, and its sequence does not reveal obvious functional roles (Petit2011Functional). The protein is related to CCDC28B, sharing 50% amino acid identity, although CCDC28B lacks recognizable motifs and its functions remain unknown (Petit2011Functional). The subcellular localization of the CCDC28A protein isoforms includes both the cytoplasm and nucleus, indicating potential roles in various cellular processes (Petit2011Functional). Information on specific post-translational modifications or detailed structural data is limited.

## Function
The CCDC28A gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in hematopoietic development and male fertility. In healthy human cells, CCDC28A is enriched in hematopoietic stem cells, common lymphoid progenitors, and naive T-and NK cells, suggesting its involvement in hematopoietic development (Petit2011Functional). The protein is found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, indicating a potential role in nuclear-cytoplasmic transport or signaling (Petit2011Functional). 

In the context of male fertility, CCDC28A is highly expressed in the testes and is crucial for sperm morphology and motility. It interacts with proteins such as SPACA1 and GSK3A, which are important for acrosome assembly and sperm head formation. The absence of CCDC28A leads to severe sperm malformations, including bent sperm heads and acrosomal defects, resulting in male infertility (Zhou2024CCDC28A). Despite these defects, the axoneme, outer dense fibers, and fibrous sheath of the sperm remain normal, highlighting the specific role of CCDC28A in sperm head integrity and function (Zhou2024CCDC28A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the CCDC28A gene have been associated with significant clinical implications, particularly in male fertility. CCDC28A deficiency in mice leads to sperm head defects, reduced sperm motility, and male infertility, indicating its crucial role in maintaining normal sperm morphology and function (Zhou2024CCDC28A). The absence of CCDC28A results in severe sperm malformations, such as bent heads and acrosome imperfections, which are critical for successful fertilization (Zhou2024CCDC28A). 

The study by Zhou et al. highlights that CCDC28A interacts with proteins like SPACA1 and GSK3A, which are essential for acrosome and flagella function. Deficiencies in these proteins due to CCDC28A deletion lead to significant defects in sperm structure and motility, contributing to infertility (Zhou2024CCDC28A). 

Furthermore, CCDC28A has been implicated in the formation of a fusion protein with NUP98, which promotes malignant myeloproliferative tumors, suggesting a potential role in tumorigenesis (Zhou2024CCDC28A). These findings underscore the importance of CCDC28A in both reproductive health and its potential involvement in certain cancers.

## Interactions
The CCDC28A protein is involved in several physical interactions that are crucial for its role in male fertility. It interacts with sperm acrosome membrane-associated protein 1 (SPACA1) and glycogen synthase kinase 3a (GSK3A), both of which are important for sperm morphology and function. SPACA1 is an acrosomal membrane protein that anchors the acrosome to the acroplaxome, and its deficiency can lead to sperm head abnormalities similar to globozoospermia (Zhou2024CCDC28A). GSK3A, a serine/threonine protein kinase, is located in the acrosome and flagella of sperm and is involved in various cellular processes. The deletion of CCDC28A results in decreased levels of SPACA1 and GSK3A in epididymal sperm, suggesting that CCDC28A may regulate these proteins to maintain normal sperm morphology and motility (Zhou2024CCDC28A).

The interactions between CCDC28A and these proteins were confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, which demonstrated that CCDC28A physically associates with SPACA1 and GSK3A (Zhou2024CCDC28A). These interactions are significant as they highlight the role of CCDC28A in ensuring proper sperm function and fertility.
