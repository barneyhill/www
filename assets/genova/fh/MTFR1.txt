# MTFR1

## Overview
MTFR1 (mitochondrial fission regulator 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics, specifically promoting mitochondrial fission. The protein, also named MTFR1, is integral to maintaining mitochondrial function, distribution, and quality control within cells. It is primarily localized to the mitochondrial outer membrane, where it plays a crucial role in cellular energy metabolism and apoptosis. MTFR1 is particularly significant in tissues with high energy demands, such as the testes, where it influences mitochondrial respiration and ATP production. The protein's function extends to the regulation of mitochondrial morphology, facilitating the transition from a network to a spheroid architecture, which is vital for processes like apoptosis and necrosis. MTFR1's interactions with microRNAs and its involvement in signaling pathways underscore its importance in both normal cellular function and disease contexts, including cancer and cardiac conditions (Monticone2010The; Li2021Negatively; Wang2015NFAT4dependent).

## Function
MTFR1 (mitochondrial fission regulator 1) is a nuclear gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics, specifically promoting mitochondrial fission. This process is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function, distribution, and quality control within cells. MTFR1 is active in the mitochondrial outer membrane, where it influences cellular energy metabolism and apoptosis (Monticone2010The; Wang2015NFAT4dependent).

In healthy cells, MTFR1 plays a critical role in mitochondrial respiration and energy production. It is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial oxygen consumption and ATP production, particularly in tissues such as the testes. Studies have shown that silencing MTFR1 impairs mitochondrial oxygen consumption, highlighting its importance in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy metabolism (Monticone2010The).

MTFR1 is also associated with the regulation of mitochondrial morphology, promoting the transition from a network to a spheroid mitochondrial architecture. This regulation is crucial for normal mitochondrial dynamics, which are vital for cellular processes such as apoptosis and necrosis (Monticone2010The; Chen2019miR‐324‐5p). Despite its role in mitochondrial fission, MTFR1 does not directly affect mitochondrial structure but rather its function (Monticone2010The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MTFR1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and cardiac conditions. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), MTFR1 is overexpressed, correlating with poor prognosis and promoting cancer cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and glycolysis. This overexpression is negatively regulated by miR-29c-3p, and the MTFR1 gene exerts its effects through the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway (Li2021Negatively). High MTFR1 expression is associated with advanced clinical stages, lymph node metastasis, and larger tumor sizes in LUAD patients (Li2021Negatively).

In cardiac diseases, MTFR1 plays a role in mitochondrial fission and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes, particularly during ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Knockdown of MTFR1 reduces myocardial infarction sizes and cardiomyocyte apoptosis, suggesting its involvement in the pathogenesis of myocardial infarction. The regulation of MTFR1 by miR-324-5p and NFAT4 forms a critical axis in these processes (Wang2015NFAT4dependent).

In the testes, MTFR1 deficiency leads to impaired expression of genes coding for reactive oxygen species scavenging enzymes, resulting in oxidative stress and potential fertility issues (Monticone2007Impaired). These findings highlight the clinical significance of MTFR1 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
MTFR1 (mitochondrial fission regulator 1) is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics, particularly mitochondrial fission. It is known to interact with various proteins and nucleic acids that influence its function in cellular processes. In cardiomyocytes, MTFR1 is a direct target of miR-324-5p, a microRNA that suppresses its translation. This interaction is crucial for regulating mitochondrial fission and apoptosis, as miR-324-5p binding to MTFR1 reduces its protein levels, thereby inhibiting these processes (Wang2015NFAT4dependent).

In the context of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), MTFR1 is negatively regulated by miR-29c-3p. This microRNA directly targets MTFR1, and its expression is inversely related to MTFR1 levels. The interaction between miR-29c-3p and MTFR1 is significant in modulating cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and glycolysis, as well as influencing the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway (Li2021Negatively). These interactions highlight the role of MTFR1 in both cardiac and cancer cell contexts, where it participates in complex regulatory networks involving microRNAs and signaling pathways.
