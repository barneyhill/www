# PNMA6E

## Overview
The PNMA6E gene encodes the protein PNMA family member 6E, which is part of the paraneoplastic Ma antigen family. This gene is located on the X chromosome and is primarily expressed in the human testis, where it plays a significant role in spermatogenesis. The PNMA6E protein is characterized by its involvement in protein-protein interactions, a common feature of the PNMA family, and is predominantly localized in the nuclei of premeiotic germ cells, pachytene spermatocytes, and round spermatids. Despite its testis-specific expression, the precise biological function of PNMA6E in gametogenesis remains to be fully elucidated. The protein shares a notable degree of evolutionary conservation with its mouse orthologue, suggesting its functional importance across species (Melaine2018Deciphering; Pang2018PNMA).

## Structure
The PNMA6E protein is encoded by the PNMA6E gene located on the X chromosome at positions 153,396,906-153,401,420. It consists of 647 amino acids and is encoded by two exons and one intron (Pang2018PNMA). The protein has two splice variants: PNMA6E-201 and PNMA6E-202. The PNMA6E-201 isoform is identified by 11 non-nested peptides, with nine unique to the PNMA6E gene, and shares a 322 amino acid sequence in the C-terminal part with PNMA6E-202 (Melaine2018Deciphering).

PNMA6E is highly expressed in the human testis and is involved in spermatogenesis, with nuclear localization observed in premeiotic germ cells, pachytene spermatocytes, and round spermatids (Melaine2018Deciphering). The protein shares 64% homology with its mouse orthologue, indicating some degree of evolutionary conservation (Melaine2018Deciphering). While specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of PNMA6E are not provided, the protein's expression pattern and homology suggest a role in gametogenesis. The PNMA family, to which PNMA6E belongs, is known for its involvement in protein-protein interactions, which may imply similar functional domains in PNMA6E (Pang2018PNMA).

## Function
The PNMA6E gene, also known as paraneoplastic Ma antigen 6E, is primarily expressed in the human testis and is involved in spermatogenesis. It is located on chromosome Xq28 and has two splice variants, PNMA6E-201 and PNMA6E-202. The PNMA6E protein is 647 amino acids long, with a significant portion sharing 100% identity with the PNMA6E-202 isoform. Expression data indicate that PNMA6E is highly expressed in the testis and at low levels in the ovary and Fallopian tubes. Within the testis, its expression is restricted to germ cells, particularly from premeiotic germ cells to round spermatids, but not in elongated spermatids. Immunohistochemistry shows nuclear staining in germ cells and some interstitial cells, but not in Leydig cells. The PNMA family, to which PNMA6E belongs, is generally expressed in the brain, but PNMA6E is unique in its testis-specific expression. The gene's expression pattern suggests a role in gametogenesis, similar to PNMA5, which is associated with female fertility. However, the specific function of PNMA6E in healthy human cells, particularly in the context of gametogenesis, requires further investigation.

## Clinical Significance
The PNMA6E gene, part of the paraneoplastic Ma antigen family, has been implicated in various clinical contexts, although its specific clinical significance remains under investigation. Mutations in PNMA6E have been observed in the early stages of disease progression in patients with Fanconi anemia (FA) transitioning to myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These mutations are prevalent during the FA-AA stage but diminish as the disease progresses to MDS, suggesting a role in early clonal architecture but not in later stages (Chang2022Polyclonal).

PNMA6E is also identified as a testis-specific gene, with potential implications in male reproductive health. Its expression is primarily restricted to the testis, with some expression in the ovary and Fallopian tubes, indicating a possible role in gametogenesis and fertility (Melaine2018Deciphering). While other members of the PNMA family are associated with neurological disorders and cancer, the specific clinical implications of PNMA6E mutations or expression changes are not well-defined (Melaine2018Deciphering).

The gene's expression changes have been noted following treatment with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, although the clinical significance of these changes is not detailed (Li2023Serine). Further research is needed to fully elucidate the clinical implications of PNMA6E.
