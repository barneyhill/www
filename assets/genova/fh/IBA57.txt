# IBA57

## Overview
The IBA57 gene encodes the iron-sulfur cluster assembly factor IBA57, a mitochondrial protein crucial for the maturation of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster proteins. This protein is a key component of the mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) assembly machinery, which is responsible for the conversion of [2Fe-2S] clusters into [4Fe-4S] clusters, essential for the function of various mitochondrial enzymes and proteins (Ajit2013Mutation; Nasta2019Structural). IBA57 interacts with other proteins, such as ISCA2, to form complexes necessary for the maturation of [4Fe-4S] proteins, thereby maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular iron homeostasis (Sheftel2012The; Nasta2019Structural). Mutations in the IBA57 gene are linked to several mitochondrial dysfunction syndromes, underscoring its critical role in cellular energy production and metabolic processes (Ajit2013Mutation; Debray2015Mutation).

## Structure
The IBA57 protein is involved in the mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster assembly machinery, forming a complex with ISCA2 that is crucial for mitochondrial function. The protein's structure has been studied using techniques such as Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) and bioinformatics-driven docking predictions. SAXS data indicate that IBA57 is monomeric in solution, while ISCA2 forms a dimer, suggesting that the IBA57-ISCA2 complex may exist as a heterodimer under physiological conditions (Nasta2019Structural).

The structural model of IBA57, available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID 6QE3), shows that its tertiary structure is consistent with its crystallized form, maintaining its shape in solution (Nasta2019Structural). The interaction between IBA57 and ISCA2 involves specific cysteine residues that coordinate the [2Fe-2S] cluster, with cysteines from both proteins playing crucial roles in cluster binding (Nasta2019Structural).

A notable mutation, Arg146Trp, affects the protein's function by impairing the formation of the [2Fe-2S] ISCA2-IBA57 complex, highlighting the importance of electrostatic interactions at the protein-protein interface for complex stability (Nasta2019Structural).

## Function
The IBA57 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the maturation of mitochondrial iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster proteins, specifically in the assembly of [4Fe-4S] clusters. This process is essential for the proper functioning of several mitochondrial enzymes and proteins, including components of the respiratory chain complexes I and II, aconitase, and lipoic acid synthase (Ajit2013Mutation; Debray2015Mutation). IBA57 is part of the mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) assembly machinery, which is responsible for converting [2Fe-2S] clusters into [4Fe-4S] clusters, a critical step for the stability and activity of these Fe-S proteins (Ajit2013Mutation; Nasta2019Structural).

In healthy human cells, IBA57 operates synergistically with other proteins such as ISCA1 and ISCA2, forming complexes necessary for the maturation of [4Fe-4S] proteins (Sheftel2012The). The protein is localized in the mitochondria, where it contributes to maintaining normal mitochondrial morphology and function, including the formation of cristae membranes (Sheftel2012The). Mutations in IBA57 can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction syndromes, highlighting its critical role in cellular energy production and metabolic processes (Ajit2013Mutation; Debray2015Mutation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IBA57 gene are associated with several severe neurological and mitochondrial disorders. One such condition is fatal infantile leukodystrophy, characterized by progressive leukoencephalopathy and a combined deficiency of respiratory chain complexes I and II. This is due to impaired assembly of iron-sulfur (Fe/S) clusters, leading to decreased mitochondrial protein lipoylation (Debray2015Mutation). 

Another disorder linked to IBA57 mutations is hereditary spastic paraplegia, which presents with spastic paraplegia, optic atrophy, and peripheral neuropathy. This condition is caused by a homozygous donor splice-site mutation in IBA57, resulting in reduced levels of functional IBA57 and decreased activities of several mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] proteins (Lossos2015FeS).

In dogs, a novel IBA57 variant, R147W, has been identified as the cause of hereditary necrotizing myelopathy, a condition characterized by progressive ataxia and paralysis. This mutation impairs the function of mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] proteins, similar to the effects seen in human multiple mitochondrial dysfunction syndrome 3 (MMDS3) (Mandigers2023A).

Mutations in IBA57 can also lead to severe myopathy and encephalopathy, with symptoms such as hypotonia, respiratory insufficiency, and congenital brain malformations. These mutations result in decreased stability and rapid degradation of the IBA57 protein, affecting mitochondrial Fe/S protein assembly (Ajit2013Mutation).

## Interactions
The IBA57 protein is involved in the mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster assembly machinery and interacts with several other proteins to facilitate the maturation of iron-sulfur (Fe/S) clusters. In yeast, IBA57 physically interacts with Isa1p and Isa2p, forming a functional complex necessary for the maturation of specific Fe/S proteins, such as aconitase-type and radical SAM enzymes (Gelling2008Mitochondrial). These interactions are specific, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments, and are not due to overexpression artifacts (Gelling2008Mitochondrial).

In humans, IBA57 interacts with ISCA2, forming a heterodimeric complex that is crucial for the maturation of mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] proteins (Sheftel2012The; Nasta2019Structural). The interaction involves electrostatic and hydrophobic contacts, with specific residues such as Arg146 of IBA57 playing a critical role in complex formation (Nasta2019Structural). Mutations in IBA57, such as Arg146Trp, disrupt these interactions, impairing the protein's function in mitochondrial biogenesis (Camponeschi2022Molecular; Nasta2019Structural). These interactions highlight the essential role of IBA57 in maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular iron homeostasis.
