# SPAG5

## Overview
The SPAG5 gene encodes the sperm associated antigen 5 protein, also known as astrin, which is a microtubule-associated protein involved in critical cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and spermatogenesis. This protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domains and leucine zipper motifs, which facilitate its role in stabilizing the spindle apparatus during mitosis and mediating protein interactions, respectively (Suzuki2006Duplicated; Shao2001Testicular). SPAG5 is essential for proper chromosome segregation and centrosome integrity, functioning as a non-motor microtubule-associated protein that localizes to centrosomes and spindle microtubules (Kersten2012The). It is involved in various cellular processes, including microtubule-based transport and cilia morphogenesis, and interacts with several proteins to execute its functions (Hémono2021CLUH; Kersten2012The). The protein's expression and function have significant implications in cancer biology, where it is associated with tumor progression and prognosis in several cancer types (Yuan2014SPAG5; AbdelFatah2016SPAG5).

## Structure
The SPAG5 protein, also known as astrin, is a microtubule-associated protein involved in cell cycle regulation and spermatogenesis. It contains coiled-coil domains, which are crucial for its function in stabilizing the spindle apparatus during mitosis (Suzuki2006Duplicated). These domains facilitate protein-protein interactions, which are essential for its role in microtubule binding and spindle targeting (Fitzgerald2005Rat). The SPAG5 protein also contains leucine zipper motifs in its C-terminal region, which mediate interactions with other proteins such as Odf1, highlighting its role in sperm tail protein interactions (Shao2001Testicular).

The molecular weight of SPAG5 varies across different cell types, with a 58 kDa variant identified in somatic cells and larger variants, such as 200 kDa, present in spermatocytes (Fitzgerald2005Rat). SPAG5 is subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which can influence its function. Multiple splice variants of SPAG5 exist, potentially altering its structure and function, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context. The protein's structure and interactions suggest a conserved role in microtubule association across different species (Fitzgerald2005Rat).

## Function
The SPAG5 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in cell division and motility, particularly in the formation and function of the mitotic spindle, which is crucial for chromosome segregation during mitosis. SPAG5 is a non-motor microtubule-associated protein that localizes to centrosomes and spindle microtubules, contributing to mitotic spindle formation, sister chromatid cohesion, and centrosome integrity (Kersten2012The). It is involved in microtubule-based transport processes within cells, interacting with the dynein-dynactin motor complex for retrograde transport, and may function as an adapter protein through its association with components like dynactin p50dynamitin and p150 Glued (Kersten2012The).

In differentiated ciliated cells, such as photoreceptor cells in the retina, SPAG5 is associated with the basal body and the apical inner segment, suggesting a role in vesicle transport and microtubule organization (Kersten2012The). It interacts with proteins like USH2A isoB and NINL isoB, which are involved in microtubule organization and nucleation during interphase (Kersten2012The). SPAG5 is essential for proper cell proliferation, and its depletion can lead to cellular growth arrest and apoptosis (Kersten2012The). The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm and centrosomes of cells, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular structure and function.

## Clinical Significance
SPAG5 (sperm associated antigen 5) has been implicated in several cancers due to its altered expression levels. In breast cancer, SPAG5 is associated with poor prognosis, particularly in estrogen receptor-positive cases. High SPAG5 expression correlates with high-grade tumors, TP53 mutations, and HER2 amplification, and is linked to shorter breast cancer-specific survival (AbdelFatah2016SPAG5). It also serves as a predictor of chemotherapy sensitivity, particularly for anthracycline-based treatments (AbdelFatah2016SPAG5).

In cervical cancer, SPAG5 is upregulated and associated with poor disease-free survival. Its high expression is an independent prognostic indicator, and downregulation of SPAG5 can inhibit cell proliferation and migration, suggesting its role in tumor progression (Yuan2014SPAG5).

SPAG5 is also overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where it promotes tumor growth and is linked to poor overall survival. It influences HCC progression through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Liu2018SPAG5).

In glioma, SPAG5 expression is higher in glioblastomas compared to low-grade gliomas and is associated with poor prognosis. Knockdown of SPAG5 reduces cell proliferation and increases apoptosis, indicating its role in glioma progression (Wang2021SPAG5).

## Interactions
SPAG5, also known as sperm associated antigen 5, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. In the testis, SPAG5 interacts with the outer dense fiber protein ODF1. This interaction is mediated by leucine zipper motifs, highlighting the importance of these motifs in sperm tail protein interactions (Shao2001Testicular). 

In the context of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), SPAG5 interacts with the c-MYC binding protein (MYCBP), forming a complex that enhances c-MYC transcriptional activity. This interaction is significant for chromosome segregation and cell cycle progression, and it also influences the expression of c-MYC target genes such as CDC25C, CDC20, RAD51, BRCA1, and BRCA2 (Li2019SPAG5). 

SPAG5 also interacts with CLUH in human HCT116 cells and mouse embryonic stem cells. This interaction occurs in cytosolic granular structures and is RNA-independent, suggesting a role in cellular structures associated with the mitotic spindle (Hémono2022The; Hémono2021CLUH). 

In the retina, SPAG5 interacts with USH2A isoB and NINL isoB proteins, indicating a role in microtubule organization and cilia morphogenesis (Kersten2012The).
