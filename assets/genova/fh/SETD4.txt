# SETD4

## Overview
SETD4 is a gene located on human chromosome 21 that encodes the protein SET domain containing 4, a member of the protein lysine methyltransferases family. This protein is characterized by its SET domain, which is integral to its function as a methyltransferase, facilitating the methylation of both histone and non-histone proteins. SETD4 plays a crucial role in cellular processes such as apoptosis regulation, tissue development, and the maintenance of quiescent stem cell populations. It is involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression, notably through the methylation of histone H4 at lysine 20, which is associated with chromatin modification and gene repression. The protein's expression and activity are implicated in various physiological and pathological contexts, including cancer, where it is associated with tumor aggressiveness and resistance to therapy (Wang2022Unmasking; Ye2019SET).

## Structure
SETD4 is a protein encoded by the human SETD4 gene, located on chromosome 21. It belongs to a unique class of protein lysine methyltransferases and shares about 20% amino acid identity with SETD6 and SETD3, with a similar 3D structure to these proteins (Wang2022Unmasking). The primary structure of SETD4 includes a SET domain, which is characteristic of proteins involved in methyltransferase activity. This domain is interrupted by an iSET region and is accompanied by a substrate binding domain similar to that of plant Rubisco large subunit methyltransferase (Wang2022Unmasking).

The secondary structure of SETD4 likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of proteins with a SET domain, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure involves the overall 3D folding, which is crucial for its function as a methyltransferase. Two highly conserved tyrosine residues, Y272 and Y284, are part of the activity centers, with Y272 being conserved with both SETD3 and SETD6. Mutations in these residues can affect the methylation activity of SETD4 (Wang2022Unmasking).

SETD4 expresses several mRNA variants, resulting in different protein isoforms, which may have distinct functional roles (Wang2022Unmasking). The protein is involved in various biological processes, including tissue development and tumorigenesis, and is expressed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, with its localization varying depending on cell type and detection methods (Wang2022Unmasking).

## Function
SETD4 is a protein involved in various cellular processes, primarily through its role as a methyltransferase. It is part of the protein lysine methyltransferases family and is involved in the methylation of non-histone proteins, such as KU70, which affects apoptosis by facilitating the translocation of KU70 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Wang2022Unmasking). In healthy human cells, SETD4 is highly expressed in quiescent stem and progenitor cells, playing a crucial role in maintaining the quiescent stem cell pool. This maintenance is essential for tissue homeostasis and regeneration, as SETD4 expression declines upon stimulation, allowing these cells to enter the cell cycle and proliferate (Wang2022Unmasking).

SETD4 is also involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression, notably through the trimethylation of histone H4 at lysine 20 (H4K20), which contributes to maintaining the quiescent status of certain stem cell populations (Wang2022Unmasking). The protein is found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, with its localization varying depending on the cell type and detection methods (Wang2022Unmasking). These functions highlight SETD4's versatile role in different physiological contexts, impacting processes such as tissue development, regeneration, and cellular quiescence.

## Clinical Significance
SETD4 has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in epigenetic regulation. In breast cancer, particularly estrogen receptor-negative (ER-negative) subtypes, SETD4 is overexpressed and associated with increased cell proliferation and tumor aggressiveness (Arantes2013SET). It is also a marker for quiescent breast cancer stem cells (qBCSCs), which are resistant to chemoradiotherapy and contribute to tumor relapse (Ye2019SET). SETD4+ qBCSCs are characterized by high CD44 and low CD24 expression, and their presence is linked to chemotherapy resistance and tumor recurrence (Ye2019SET).

In addition to breast cancer, SETD4 has been associated with other cancer types, including gastric, cervical, ovarian, liver, and lung cancers, where it may play a role in maintaining cancer stem cell quiescence and resistance to therapy (Ye2019SET). SETD4's involvement in radiation-induced thymic lymphoma has also been studied, where its deletion in mice extended survival, suggesting a potential oncogenic role (Feng2020Loss). These findings highlight SETD4 as a potential target for therapeutic interventions in various cancers.

## Interactions
SETD4 interacts with the non-histone substrate KU70, specifically methylating lysine-570 in the KU70-nSAP domain. This methylation causes KU70 to dissociate from KU80, a protein it typically dimerizes with for DNA repair, and translocate to the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, methylated KU70 interacts with cytosolic BAX, preventing BAX from entering mitochondria and thereby suppressing apoptosis (Wang2022Unmasking).

SETD4 is also involved in histone methylation, specifically methylating lysine 4 on histone 3 (H3K4) at the promoters of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6. This activity suggests interactions with histones, facilitating transcriptional activation of these cytokines in macrophages (Zhong2019The). In breast cancer stem cells, SETD4 catalyzes the trimethylation of lysine 20 on histone 4 (H4K20me3), a modification associated with heterochromatin formation and gene repression, indicating its role in chromatin modification (Ye2019SET).

While specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, SETD4's role in histone methylation implies interactions with chromatin-associated proteins, potentially influencing gene expression and cellular processes (Ye2019SET).
