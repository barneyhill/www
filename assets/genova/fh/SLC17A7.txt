# SLC17A7

## Overview
The SLC17A7 gene encodes the protein known as vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1), which is a member of the solute carrier family 17. VGLUT1 is a transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in the central nervous system by facilitating the transport of the neurotransmitter glutamate into synaptic vesicles, a process essential for glutamatergic neurotransmission (Fremeau2004Vesicular; Reimer2013SLC17:). This transporter is predominantly expressed in regions of the brain such as the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellar cortex, where it ensures the availability of glutamate for synaptic transmission, thereby influencing cognitive functions like learning and memory (Bellocchio2000Uptake). VGLUT1's activity is dependent on chloride ions, distinguishing it from other neurotransmitter transporters (Reimer2013SLC17:). Beyond its neurological roles, VGLUT1 is also expressed in pancreatic β cells, indicating its involvement in broader physiological processes (Reimer2013SLC17:). The gene's significance extends to clinical contexts, where its dysregulation is associated with various neurological disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Hu2020The).

## Structure
The SLC17A7 gene encodes the vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1), which is part of the SLC17 family of transporters. These transporters are integral membrane proteins characterized by 12 transmembrane domains, which are typical of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) (Omote2016Structure; Reimer2013SLC17:). The primary structure of VGLUT1 consists of amino acid sequences that form these transmembrane helices, facilitating its role in neurotransmitter transport (Sreedharan2010Glutamate).

The secondary structure of VGLUT1 likely includes alpha-helices, which are common in membrane-spanning regions of proteins (Sreedharan2010Glutamate). The tertiary structure involves the arrangement of these helices within the membrane, although specific details are not provided in the available context. The quaternary structure may involve interactions with other proteins, but specific interactions or formations are not detailed (Reimer2013SLC17:).

VGLUT1 is known for its role in synaptic vesicle recycling and release, mediated by a unique poly-proline domain that interacts with endophilin (Reimer2013SLC17:). The protein's function is influenced by chloride ions and endogenous factors like ketone bodies, although specific post-translational modifications are not detailed in the context (Reimer2013SLC17:).

## Function
The SLC17A7 gene encodes the vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1), which is essential for the accumulation and release of glutamate in synaptic vesicles, a critical process for glutamatergic neurotransmission in the central nervous system (Reimer2013SLC17:). VGLUT1 is predominantly expressed in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellar cortex, where it facilitates the transport of glutamate into synaptic vesicles, enabling efficient neurotransmitter release during synaptic transmission (Bellocchio2000Uptake; Fremeau2004Vesicular).

The transporter exhibits a marked preference for L-glutamate and requires chloride ions for its activity, distinguishing it from other neurotransmitter transport systems that rely on a sodium electrochemical gradient (Bellocchio2000Uptake; Reimer2013SLC17:). VGLUT1's role in glutamatergic signaling is crucial for various brain functions, including memory and learning, as it ensures the availability of glutamate-filled vesicles for neurotransmission (Reimer2013SLC17:).

In addition to its role in the central nervous system, VGLUT1 is expressed in pancreatic β cells, where it is involved in intercellular signaling, highlighting its importance in both neuronal and non-neuronal tissues (Reimer2013SLC17:).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the SLC17A7 gene, which encodes a vesicular glutamate transporter, have been implicated in several neurological disorders. Dysfunction in SLC17A7 can lead to excitotoxicity due to the accumulation of synaptic glutamate, a condition associated with various brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, autism, and schizophrenia (Hu2020The). Reduced expression of SLC17A7 has been linked to enhanced anxiety, depressive-like behavior, and impaired recognition memory in mice, suggesting its potential involvement in mood and cognitive disorders (Hu2020The). These findings indicate that SLC17A7 plays a critical role in maintaining normal glutamatergic neurotransmission, and its dysregulation may contribute to the pathophysiology of these conditions. Despite its significance, SLC17A7 remains under-utilized as a drug target for brain disorders, although targeting it could be beneficial for treating these conditions and improving drug transport across the blood-brain barrier (Hu2020The). The clinical significance of SLC17A7 gene mutations in human diseases is still under investigation, but its role in synaptic transmission and neurotransmitter transport highlights its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
SLC17A7, also known as VGLUT1, is involved in synaptic transmission and interacts with various proteins critical for neurotransmitter release and synaptic vesicle cycling. It is primarily expressed in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellar cortex, where it facilitates the transport of glutamate into synaptic vesicles (Omote2016Structure; Reimer2013SLC17:). VGLUT1 interacts with synaptic vesicle markers and is associated with synaptic vesicle recycling and release through its poly-proline domain, which interacts with endophilin (Reimer2013SLC17:).

In the context of isoflurane-induced anesthesia, SLC17A7 is involved in nerve signaling processes, including 'cell-cell signaling', 'synaptic transmission', and 'transmission of nerve impulse'. It interacts with other genes such as Camk4 and Syn1 within a protein-protein interaction network, suggesting its role in synaptic transmission and nerve impulse transmission (Wang2015Biological).

In diabetic retinas, SLC17A7, encoded as VGLUT1, shows altered expression, indicating its significant role in retinal synaptic transmission. The downregulation of VGLUT1 in specific retinal layers suggests its involvement in the synaptic transmission network, impacting retinal function (Ly2013Retinal).
