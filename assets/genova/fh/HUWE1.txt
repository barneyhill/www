# HUWE1

## Overview
HUWE1 is a gene located on the X chromosome that encodes the HECT, UBA, and WWE domain containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1, a large and multifunctional enzyme. This protein is categorized as a HECT-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, which plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitination process, a post-translational modification critical for protein degradation, cellular signaling, and homeostasis. The HUWE1 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including DNA replication, repair, and cell cycle regulation, by targeting key proteins such as p53 and N-Myc for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Its activity is essential for maintaining genomic stability and proper neural development, with implications in both neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer (Giles2020Roles; Choe2016HUWE1).

## Structure
HUWE1 is a large E3 ubiquitin ligase with a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of HUWE1 consists of 4374 amino acids, making it a giant protein (Qi2022The). The secondary structure includes several domains, such as the HECT domain at the C-terminus, which is crucial for its ubiquitin ligase activity. This domain has a bilobal architecture with an N-terminal lobe consisting of 13 α-helices and 7 β-strands, and a C-terminal lobe with 4 α-helices and 4 β-strands (Kao2018Ubiquitination). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a functional 3D shape, allowing HUWE1 to mediate ubiquitination of diverse substrates (Qi2022The).

HUWE1 also contains several other domains, including the ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain, WWE domain, and BH3 domain, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and ubiquitin binding (Giles2020Roles; Xu2016The). The quaternary structure is characterized by the ability of the HECT domain to form dimers, which can lead to autoinhibition of its catalytic activity (Giles2020Roles). The protein's large size and complex structure allow it to mediate the ubiquitination of a multitude of diverse substrates (Qi2022The).

## Function
The HUWE1 gene encodes a HECT-type E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability and regulating various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in the ubiquitination and degradation of several key proteins, including the tumor suppressor protein p53, which is essential for controlling cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and differentiation (Aprigliano2021Increased). HUWE1 also interacts with the replication factor PCNA to alleviate replication stress, promoting the restart of stalled replication forks and preventing DNA breakage (Choe2016HUWE1). This interaction is critical for maintaining replication fork stability and DNA damage tolerance (Choe2016HUWE1).

In the nervous system, HUWE1 regulates the balance between proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitors by targeting transcription factors such as N-Myc and Atoh1 for degradation. This regulation is vital for proper brain development and the maintenance of neural stem cell compartments (Giles2020Roles). HUWE1 is also involved in the organization of cortical layers and the differentiation of neuronal progenitors, ensuring proper neuronal migration and development (Bosshard2017Impaired). Its activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing genomic instability, which can lead to tumorigenesis (Choe2016HUWE1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the HUWE1 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders and other conditions. HUWE1 mutations, such as R4013W, R2981H, and R4187C, are linked to non-syndromic X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) and are found in conserved regions of the protein, particularly affecting the HECT ubiquitin ligase domain, which is crucial for its function (Giles2020Roles). These mutations can impair HUWE1 function, leading to intellectual disabilities and other neurodevelopmental issues like craniosynostosis, seizures, and autism (Giles2020Roles).

HUWE1 gene copy number variations (CNVs) have been associated with non-syndromic intellectual disability, with microduplications of chromosome Xp11.22 leading to increased HUWE1 expression levels correlating with ID (Giles2020Roles). The gene is also implicated in syndromic forms of ID, such as Juberg-Marsidi-Brooks syndrome, with specific mutations like G4310R linked to these conditions (Giles2020Roles).

In cancer, HUWE1 mutations and copy number alterations are observed in various types, including neuroendocrine prostate cancer and breast cancer, where it shows significant co-expression with other genes (Su2019Meta‑analysis). HUWE1's role in tumorigenesis is complex, as it can act as either an oncogene or tumor suppressor depending on the context (Qi2022The).

## Interactions
HUWE1, a HECT-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, engages in various interactions with proteins involved in DNA replication, repair, and cell cycle regulation. It interacts with the replication factor PCNA at stalled replication forks through a PCNA-interacting motif (PIP-box), which is crucial for DNA damage tolerance and proper localization of HUWE1 to replication forks (Choe2016HUWE1). This interaction facilitates the mono-ubiquitination of the histone variant H2AX, promoting the recruitment of repair proteins such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 (Choe2016HUWE1).

HUWE1 also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p14ARF, which inhibits its catalytic activity by binding to its activation segment. This interaction affects HUWE1's auto-ubiquitination activity, suggesting a regulatory role in its function (Sander2017A). Additionally, HUWE1 targets Cdc6 for ubiquitination and degradation in response to DNA damage, acting as a tumor suppressor by driving cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Qi2022The).

The protein's structure includes domains such as BH3 and WWE, which facilitate interactions with specific substrates like Mcl-1 and PARylated proteins, respectively (Hunkeler2021Solenoid). These interactions highlight HUWE1's role in maintaining genomic stability and regulating cellular processes.
