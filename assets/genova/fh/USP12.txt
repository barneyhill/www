# USP12

## Overview
USP12 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquitin specific peptidase 12, a deubiquitinating enzyme involved in the regulation of protein stability and signaling pathways within cells. As a member of the ubiquitin-specific protease family, USP12 plays a critical role in removing ubiquitin moieties from target proteins, thereby influencing their degradation, localization, and activity. The protein is characterized by a conserved catalytic domain and forms complexes with other proteins such as UAF1 and WDR20, which modulate its enzymatic activity. USP12 is implicated in various cellular processes, including tumor suppression, immune response regulation, and signaling pathway modulation, such as the Notch and PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathways. Its dysregulation is associated with several diseases, particularly cancers, where it can act as both a tumor suppressor and promoter, depending on the context (OlazabalHerrero2019WDR20; Niu2023Spotlights; Fu2021USP12).

## Structure
USP12 is a deubiquitinating enzyme characterized by a conserved catalytic domain typical of ubiquitin-specific proteases. This domain includes a cysteine catalytic triad essential for its enzymatic activity (Niu2023Spotlights). The core catalytic structure of USP12 consists of three sub-structural domains: the finger, palm, and thumb domains. The 'finger' domain is responsible for holding the ubiquitin core, while the catalytic center is located between the 'palm' and 'thumb' subdomains. A unique structural feature of USP12 is the Pinky Finger, a curly sequence that provides structural flexibility (Niu2023Spotlights).

USP12 forms a complex with the WD40 repeat protein UAF1, which activates the enzyme. The USP12-UAF1 complex exhibits a 1:2 stoichiometry, indicating that two UAF1 molecules bind to one USP12 molecule. This binding occurs in a two-step process, with the first high-affinity binding event being crucial for activation (Dharadhar2016A). USP12 can also interact with WDR20, which further modulates its activity (Niu2023Spotlights).

The structural conservation between USP12 and its paralog USP46 is notable, with an 88% sequence similarity, suggesting similar regulatory mechanisms and structural features (Dharadhar2016A).

## Function
USP12 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 12) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a significant role in various cellular processes by removing ubiquitin from target proteins, thereby regulating their stability, localization, and activity. In healthy human cells, USP12 functions as a tumor suppressor and is involved in the regulation of several signaling pathways. It stabilizes the androgen receptor, T-cell receptor complex, and Notch receptor, influencing their signaling pathways (OlazabalHerrero2019WDR20).

USP12 is also a negative regulator of Notch signaling, where it deubiquitinates nonactivated Notch, facilitating its lysosomal degradation. This action reduces the amount of Notch receptor at the cell surface, thereby modulating Notch activity, which is crucial for development and tissue physiology (Moretti2012The). USP12's role in Notch signaling is upstream of ligand-induced activation, affecting the receptor's trafficking and degradation (Moretti2012The).

In the immune system, USP12 is critical for CD4+ T cell activation, influencing cytokine production and the NF-κB signaling pathway. It stabilizes BCL10, a key component in T cell receptor signaling, thereby promoting adaptive immune responses (Fu2021USP12). USP12 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, with its subcellular localization regulated by cofactors such as WDR20 and UAF1, which enhance its enzymatic activity (OlazabalHerrero2019WDR20).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of USP12 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 12) have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), USP12 is often downregulated, which is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to PD-1 blockade therapy. This downregulation is linked to the hyperactivation of the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, leading to a protumorigenic microenvironment characterized by increased tumor-associated macrophages and enhanced PD-L1 expression (Yang2021USP12). 

In prostate cancer, USP12 promotes tumor development by stabilizing the androgen receptor (AR) through deubiquitination, which enhances cell proliferation (Niu2023Spotlights). In breast cancer, USP12 is involved in metastasis via the USP12-MDK axis, which activates the Akt signaling pathway and promotes angiogenesis. Knockdown of USP12 in breast cancer models reduces lung metastasis and CD31 protein levels (Niu2023Spotlights).

USP12 also plays a role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis through the p38-MAPK pathway (Niu2023Spotlights). In multiple myeloma, USP12 contributes to drug resistance by promoting cell growth and autophagy (Niu2023Spotlights). These findings suggest that USP12 is a potential therapeutic target in various cancers.

## Interactions
USP12 interacts with several proteins that modulate its activity and function. It forms a complex with WDR48 (also known as UAF1), which significantly enhances its deubiquitinating activity. This interaction involves a two-step binding mechanism with two distinct interfaces. The first interface, characterized by high-affinity binding, is crucial for USP12 activation, while the second interface, although involved in binding, does not contribute to activation (Dharadhar2016A). USP12 also interacts with WDR20, which can further activate its deubiquitinating function. This interaction is unique to USP12 and USP46, as USP1 does not share this capability due to structural differences (Niu2023Spotlights; Dharadhar2016A).

USP12 is involved in the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway, where it forms a complex with UAF1 and WDR20 to deubiquitinate and stabilize PHLPP and PHLPPL, thereby reducing active p-Akt levels (Niu2023Spotlights). Additionally, USP12 interacts with the androgen receptor (AR), stabilizing it and influencing its transcriptional activity, which is significant in prostate cancer development (Niu2023Spotlights). These interactions highlight USP12's role in various cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target.
