# SYPL1

## Overview
The SYPL1 gene encodes the synaptophysin-like protein 1, a transmembrane protein involved in vesicle trafficking and membrane dynamics. This protein plays a critical role in the biogenesis and transport of vesicles, particularly in the trafficking of the insulin-responsive GLUT4 glucose transporter, which is essential for glucose homeostasis (Hacker2018Molecular). Synaptophysin-like 1 is also implicated in synaptic function and plasticity, impacting neural communication and brain function by facilitating synaptic vesicle trafficking necessary for neurotransmitter release (Hacker2018Molecular). Additionally, SYPL1 interacts with various proteins, such as the SNARE protein VAMP3, to regulate vesicle fusion and trafficking, and is involved in the localization of glycolytic enzymes in sperm cells (Liu2023SYPL1). The gene's expression is altered in several cancers, making it a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Song2020SYPL1; Chen2017SYPL1).

## Function
The SYPL1 gene encodes Synaptophysin-like protein 1, which is involved in vesicle trafficking and membrane dynamics. In healthy human cells, SYPL1 is associated with vesicle membranes and plays a multifunctional role in vesicle biogenesis and transport. It is particularly involved in the trafficking of the insulin-responsive GLUT4 glucose transporter from intracellular vesicles to the plasma membrane, a function crucial for maintaining glucose homeostasis (Hacker2018Molecular). SYPL1 is also a component of small cytoplasmic transport vesicles, associated with GLUT4-containing vesicles in adipocytes and extracellular exosomes (Chen2017SYPL1).

SYPL1 is active in the cytoplasm and is crucial for maintaining synaptic function and plasticity, impacting neural communication and overall brain function. It is involved in the trafficking of synaptic vesicles, which are essential for neurotransmitter release (Hacker2018Molecular). The protein is also suggested to be a probable regulator of the NF-κB signaling pathway, although its exact functional role in this context remains unclear (Chen2017SYPL1). These activities highlight SYPL1's role in essential cellular processes, including vesicle trafficking and signal transduction, which are vital for normal cellular and organismal function.

## Clinical Significance
SYPL1 (synaptophysin like 1) has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SYPL1 is significantly overexpressed, correlating with poor prognosis and reduced overall and disease-free survival rates. Its expression is associated with malignant features such as microvascular invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, potentially through the NF-κB/Snail signaling pathway (Chen2017SYPL1). Similarly, in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), SYPL1 is upregulated and linked to poor prognosis, promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis. It is associated with pathways related to cell cycle and DNA replication, and its knockdown increases apoptosis through reactive oxygen species-induced ERK activation (Song2020SYPL1).

SYPL1 is also involved in glioblastomas, where its expression is correlated with vesicle dynamics and intracellular trafficking, processes crucial for tumor growth and survival (Boccacino2024Integrated). In uterine leiomyomata, SYPL1 expression is decreased in cases with interstitial deletion of chromosome 7q, suggesting a potential role in this condition (Hodge2009Identifying). These findings highlight SYPL1's potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in various cancers.

## Interactions
SYPL1 (synaptophysin-like 1) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in vesicle trafficking and membrane dynamics. One of the primary interactions of SYPL1 is with the SNARE protein VAMP3. This interaction is essential for the formation of cytoplasmic droplets (CD) during spermatid development, as SYPL1 partners with VAMP3 to facilitate vesicle fusion and trafficking. The interaction between SYPL1 and VAMP3 is post-transcriptional, affecting VAMP3 protein levels without altering its mRNA levels (Liu2023SYPL1).

SYPL1 also plays a role in sequestering glycolytic enzymes such as HK1 and PGK2 to the CD, which is crucial for their proper localization and function in sperm cells. In the absence of SYPL1, these enzymes fail to concentrate in the CD, indicating a disruption in protein localization (Liu2023SYPL1).

In the context of cancer, SYPL1 has been identified as a target gene of miR-506-3p in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The expression of SYPL1 is negatively correlated with miR-506-3p levels, suggesting a regulatory interaction that influences cancer progression (Ding2022YY1).
