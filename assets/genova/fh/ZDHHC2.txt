# ZDHHC2

## Overview
ZDHHC2 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger DHHC-type palmitoyltransferase 2, a member of the DHHC family of palmitoyltransferases. This enzyme is characterized by its DHHC cysteine-rich domain, which serves as the catalytic center for the palmitoylation of proteins, a post-translational modification critical for protein localization, stability, and function (Korycka2012Human). The ZDHHC2 protein is a transmembrane enzyme with four transmembrane domains and is predominantly expressed in the brain, lung, kidney, and pancreas (Gadalla2019Toward). It plays a significant role in synaptic plasticity and neural signaling by palmitoylating synaptic proteins such as PSD-95 and AKAP150, which are essential for excitatory synaptic transmission and plasticity (Liao2024The). Alterations in ZDHHC2 expression or function have been linked to various diseases, including schizophrenia, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, and psoriasis, highlighting its importance in both normal physiological processes and disease pathogenesis (Zhang2020Fine‐mapping; Liu2020Bioinformatics; Zhou2021Zdhhc2).

## Structure
The ZDHHC2 protein is a member of the DHHC family of palmitoyltransferases, characterized by the presence of a DHHC (Asp-His-His-Cys) cysteine-rich domain, which serves as the catalytic center for palmitoylation reactions (Korycka2012Human). This domain includes a Cys4 zinc-finger-like metal ion binding site, crucial for the enzyme's structural integrity and function (Liao2024The). ZDHHC2 has a molecular weight of 42 kDa and contains four transmembrane domains, with the cysteine-rich domain located between the second and third transmembrane domains (Gadalla2019Toward).

The protein's structure allows it to cycle between the plasma membrane and endosomes, a process potentially regulated by phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues near endocytic motifs (Zmuda2020Regulatory; Salaun2017The). The C-terminal domain of ZDHHC2 contains distinct sorting signals, including a dileucine motif and an Asn-Pro motif, which influence its intracellular localization (Salaun2017The). These motifs are involved in the protein's endocytic trafficking, with phosphorylation enhancing the recognition of these signals by adaptor proteins (Zmuda2020Regulatory).

ZDHHC2 is expressed at high levels in the brain, lung, kidney, and pancreas, and is involved in the palmitoylation of proteins such as tetraspanins CD9 and CD151, affecting their stability and interactions (Korycka2012Human).

## Function
ZDHHC2 encodes a palmitoyltransferase enzyme involved in the post-translational modification of proteins through S-palmitoylation, which attaches palmitic acid to cysteine residues. This modification is crucial for protein localization, stability, and function. ZDHHC2 is active in the Golgi apparatus and plasma membrane, where it influences various cellular processes, including signaling pathways, growth, and differentiation (Korycka2012Human).

In healthy human cells, ZDHHC2 plays a significant role in the brain, where it is involved in the palmitoylation of synaptic proteins such as PSD-95 and AKAP150. This process is essential for synaptic plasticity and the regulation of AMPA receptors, which are critical for excitatory synaptic transmission and plasticity, impacting learning, memory, and behavior (Liao2024The). ZDHHC2 also regulates the postsynaptic accumulation of PSD-95, mediating synaptic palmitoylation dynamics and stabilizing synaptic proteins (Zmuda2020Regulatory).

ZDHHC2's palmitoylation activity extends to other proteins, such as tetraspanins CD9 and CD151, enhancing cell-cell contacts and protecting them from lysosomal degradation. It also palmitoylates CKAP4, facilitating its trafficking and nuclear localization, which is necessary for antiproliferative factor-induced gene expression changes (Korycka2012Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the ZDHHC2 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In schizophrenia, particularly within the Han Chinese population, both rare and common variants of ZDHHC2 have been associated with the disorder. Rare missense variants such as p.Val145Ile, p.Arg269Gln, and p.Glu319Lys are predicted to have functional effects, potentially impacting synaptic plasticity and neuronal activity regulation (Zhang2020Fine‐mapping). The study suggests that these mutations may impair palmitoyl transferase activity, affecting synaptic proteins like PSD95 and AKAP79/150, which are crucial for AMPAR trafficking (Zhang2020Fine‐mapping).

In kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), ZDHHC2 is significantly down-regulated in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. This downregulation is associated with poor prognosis and may contribute to tumor progression by affecting immune or metabolic pathways (Liu2020Bioinformatics). The decreased expression of ZDHHC2 correlates with the progression of KIRC, suggesting its role in tumorigenesis (Liu2020Bioinformatics).

In psoriasis, ZDHHC2 is essential for the inflammatory response mediated by plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Its deficiency leads to reduced cytokine production and immune cell infiltration, indicating its role in the pathogenesis of this inflammatory skin disease (Zhou2021Zdhhc2).

## Interactions
ZDHHC2 is involved in the palmitoylation of various proteins, which is crucial for synaptic plasticity and neural signaling. It specifically palmitoylates AKAP150, a process important for the regulation of AMPARs and synaptic plasticity, leading to the accumulation of the AMPAR GluA1 subunit (Liao2024The). ZDHHC2 also mediates the palmitoylation of PSD-95, a scaffolding protein that regulates the integration and stability of AMPARs in excitatory postsynaptic membranes (Liao2024The). 

The localization and function of ZDHHC2 are regulated by phosphorylation, which affects its interaction with clathrin adaptor proteins. Phosphorylation of specific serine and threonine residues enhances the recognition of endocytic motifs by AP2, facilitating endocytosis and affecting ZDHHC2's cycling between the plasma membrane and endosomes (Zmuda2020Regulatory; Salaun2017The). 

ZDHHC2 is also implicated in the palmitoylation of viral proteins, such as the non-structural protein 1 (NSP1) of the Chikungunya virus, which is essential for viral RNA replication (Gadalla2019Toward). Despite its involvement in these processes, specific details on direct physical interactions of ZDHHC2 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively documented in the provided context.
