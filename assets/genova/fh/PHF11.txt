# PHF11

## Overview
PHF11 is a gene that encodes the PHD finger protein 11, a protein characterized by its involvement in DNA damage response and chromatin-mediated transcriptional regulation. The protein contains an extended plant homeodomain (PHD) finger, a zinc-binding motif that facilitates protein-protein interactions and recognizes methylated lysine residues on histone tails, thereby playing a significant role in DNA repair processes (Zahn2017Putting; Gong2017PHF11). PHF11 is expressed in two alternatively spliced isoforms and is crucial for the resection of double-strand breaks (DSBs), ATR signaling, and homologous recombination (HR), which are essential for maintaining genomic stability (Gong2017PHF11). Additionally, PHF11 is implicated in telomere maintenance and T-cell activation, highlighting its importance in both genomic integrity and immune function (Rahman2010A; Gong2017PHF11).

## Structure
PHF11 encodes a protein characterized by an extended plant homeodomain (PHD) finger, which is a zinc-binding motif involved in protein-protein interactions and chromatin-mediated transcriptional regulation (Zahn2017Putting; Gong2017PHF11). The PHD finger recognizes methylated lysine residues on histone tails, playing a role in DNA damage response and repair processes (Zahn2017Putting). The extended PHD finger consists of a pre-PHD region that binds a single zinc ion, leading to a loop with some α-helical character, and a PHD finger motif where two additional zinc ions bind (Zahn2017Putting).

PHF11 is expressed in two alternatively spliced isoforms, with the shorter variant being a 39-amino-acid N-terminal truncation (Zahn2017Putting). The protein also contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS), which is crucial for its nuclear localization and function in DNA damage response (Muscat2015PHF11). The NLS is located between residues 172 and 181, and sequences between amino acids 218 and 331 are not necessary for nuclear localization (Muscat2015PHF11).

PHF11 does not possess intrinsic nuclease activity but interacts with several proteins involved in DNA resection, such as RPA, EXO1, and the MRN complex, enhancing their activity in the presence of RPA (Gong2017PHF11). The C-terminal domain of PHF11 is essential for its chromatin association and homodimerization (Gong2017PHF11).

## Function
The PHF11 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in DNA damage response and repair processes in human cells. It is involved in the resection of double-strand breaks (DSBs), ATR signaling, and homologous recombination (HR), which are essential for maintaining genomic stability. PHF11 facilitates the accumulation of replication protein A (RPA) at DNA lesions, promoting efficient DNA resection and repair (Gong2017PHF11). It interacts with several proteins involved in DNA resection, including RPA32, the MRN complex, and EXO1, enhancing the activity of EXO1 by overcoming its inhibition by RPA (Gong2017PHF11).

PHF11 is also implicated in telomere maintenance, as it binds to dysfunctional telomeres and influences the formation of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) at these sites, crucial for activating the ATR kinase signaling pathway (Gong2017PHF11). In the context of T-cell biology, PHF11 is involved in T-cell activation and viability, particularly through its interaction with the NF-kB pathway. It enhances NF-kB DNA binding and regulates the expression of genes like IFNG, contributing to immune response modulation (Rahman2010A). PHF11's role in these processes underscores its importance in both DNA repair and immune function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PHF11 gene have been linked to various immune-related conditions. Genetic studies have associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PHF11 with allergic phenotypes, such as asthma and atopic dermatitis. Specifically, the G allele of SNP rs1046295 is linked to reduced PHF11 expression in Th1 cells, which may predispose individuals to atopy due to decreased Th1 viability and cytokine production (Rahman2010A; Zhang2014Functional). 

PHF11's role in T-cell activation and viability is crucial, as its knock-down leads to reduced NF-kB nuclear import and decreased expression of the CD28 co-receptor, impairing T-cell function and viability. This can result in a Th2 bias, increasing Th2 cytokine expression and IgE levels, which are associated with allergic diseases (Rahman2010A). 

In addition to its immune functions, PHF11 is involved in DNA damage response. Alterations in PHF11 expression can impact DNA repair mechanisms, potentially influencing cellular responses to DNA damage and contributing to genomic instability, which may have implications for cancer development (Gong2017PHF11).

## Interactions
PHF11 interacts with several proteins involved in DNA damage response and repair processes. It is known to bind with the single-stranded DNA-binding protein RPA, which is crucial for its role in DNA resection and homologous recombination (HR) (Zahn2017Putting; Gong2017PHF11). PHF11 also interacts with the MRN complex, EXO1, DNA2, and the BRCA1 partner BARD1, facilitating DNA double-strand break (DSB) resection and ATR signaling (Gong2017PHF11). These interactions are dependent on the C-terminal domain of PHF11, which is necessary for its association with chromatin and homodimerization (Gong2017PHF11).

PHF11 enhances EXO1 activity by overcoming the inhibitory effect of RPA, promoting 5' end resection at DNA damage sites (Zahn2017Putting; Gong2017PHF11). This interaction is particularly significant as it stimulates EXO1-mediated resection of DNA, which is essential for efficient HR (Gong2017PHF11). PHF11's interaction with RPA is mediated by its PHD finger domain, which is crucial for binding to RPA-coated DNA repair intermediates (Zahn2017Putting). These interactions highlight PHF11's role as a mediator in DNA repair processes, particularly in facilitating the resection of DSBs.
