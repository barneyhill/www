# FAM241B

## Overview
FAM241B is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 241, member B. This protein is involved in various biological processes, although its precise functions remain to be fully elucidated. FAM241B has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, suggesting its potential role in disease mechanisms. The protein encoded by FAM241B is not currently categorized under a specific protein class such as kinases or receptors, indicating that its functional characterization is still under investigation. Research has highlighted its differential expression in astrocytes in models of Parkinson's disease and its association with cancer metastasis, as well as its potential involvement in lipid metabolism (Olatunji2023Multimodal; Khan2022Singlecell; Leite2024Novel).

## Clinical Significance
The FAM241B gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels. In a study investigating the effects of pesticide exposure on a mouse model of Parkinson's disease, FAM241B was identified as one of the top three most significant differentially expressed genes in astrocytes. This suggests a potential role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, particularly in the context of pesticide-induced neurodegeneration (Khan2022Singlecell).

In cancer research, FAM241B has been associated with distant metastasis in carcinoma patients. A study using a multimodal AI approach identified FAM241B as one of the genes overlapping in the combined group of bladder carcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, indicating its potential involvement in cancer progression and metastasis (Olatunji2023Multimodal).

Additionally, FAM241B has been noted in studies related to lipid metabolism. In a genome-wide association study conducted on a highly admixed Brazilian population, FAM241B was associated with serum lipid traits, although its specific function or clinical significance in lipid metabolism was not detailed (Leite2024Novel). These findings suggest that FAM241B may play a role in various pathological processes, but further research is needed to fully understand its clinical implications.
