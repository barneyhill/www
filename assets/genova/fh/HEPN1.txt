# HEPN1

## Overview
The HEPN1 gene encodes the protein hepatocellular carcinoma, down-regulated 1, which is implicated in the regulation of cell growth and apoptosis. This protein is predominantly active in the cytoplasm and is thought to function as a tumor suppressor, particularly in liver tissues (Moh2003HEPN1). HEPN1 is ubiquitously expressed in non-tumorous liver tissues, highlighting its potential role in maintaining normal liver function and cellular homeostasis (Moh2003HEPN1). The gene's expression is notably down-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma, suggesting its involvement in cancer suppression (Moh2003HEPN1). Additionally, HEPN1 expression is modulated by microRNA-21, which is upregulated in liver cancer, further implicating its role in tumorigenesis (Hu2015MicroRNA21). Beyond liver cancer, HEPN1 has been identified as a potential biomarker for breast cancer prognosis, with its expression levels correlating with patient survival rates (Xu2022Screening).

## Structure


## Function
The HEPN1 gene is involved in regulating cell growth and apoptosis, playing a crucial role in maintaining normal cellular functions in healthy human cells. It is ubiquitously expressed in non-tumorous liver tissues, suggesting its importance in normal liver function and cellular homeostasis (Moh2003HEPN1). The HEPN1 protein is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, where it influences cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, potentially acting as a tumor suppressor (Moh2003HEPN1).

In vitro studies have demonstrated that HEPN1 can suppress cell growth and induce apoptosis in HepG2 cells, a liver cancer cell line, indicating its antiproliferative effects (Moh2003HEPN1). The expression of HEPN1 in these cells leads to a significant reduction in colony formation and the induction of apoptotic markers, such as Annexin V-PS binding, which is an early indicator of apoptosis (Moh2003HEPN1). These findings suggest that HEPN1 may help prevent uncontrolled cell proliferation by modulating pathways involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, thereby contributing to its role as a tumor suppressor in liver tissue (Moh2003HEPN1).

## Clinical Significance
The HEPN1 gene is frequently down-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a common form of liver cancer. In a study involving 23 HCC patients, HEPN1 expression was significantly reduced or lost in 95.7% of the cancerous tissues compared to non-tumorous liver tissues, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor gene (Moh2003HEPN1). The down-regulation of HEPN1 is associated with increased cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis in liver cancer cells, particularly in the HepG2 cell line, where its expression is completely lost (Moh2003HEPN1).

HEPN1 expression is also influenced by microRNA-21 (miR-21), which is upregulated in HCC. miR-21 targets the 3′ untranslated region of HEPN1, leading to its down-regulation and contributing to the carcinogenesis of hepatocytes. Inhibition of miR-21 can upregulate HEPN1 expression, suppressing cell proliferation in HCC cells (Hu2015MicroRNA21).

Beyond liver cancer, HEPN1 has been identified as a potential biomarker for breast cancer prognosis. Its low expression levels in breast cancer tissues are associated with decreased overall survival rates, indicating its potential role in breast cancer progression (Xu2022Screening).
