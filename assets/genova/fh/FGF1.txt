# FGF1

## Overview
Fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) is a gene that encodes the protein fibroblast growth factor 1, a member of the fibroblast growth factor family known for its involvement in a wide range of biological processes, including cell growth, development, and tissue repair. The FGF1 protein is characterized by its β-trefoil fold structure, which facilitates its interaction with fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) and heparan sulfate proteoglycans, playing a crucial role in cellular signaling pathways such as Ras/MAPK, PI3K/Akt, and PLCγ (Zakrzewska2008FGF1:). Notably, FGF1 is unique in its ability to activate all FGFR isoforms, which underscores its versatility in regulating diverse cellular functions, including metabolism, angiogenesis, and stem cell maintenance (Gasser2022Metabolic). The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to various clinical conditions, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Rafiqdoost2014Investigation; Marwa2016FGF1).

## Structure
Fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) is a protein characterized by a β-trefoil fold, a common structural motif in the FGF family. This fold consists of 12 β-strands forming 6 β-hairpins, which are organized into a 6-stranded β-barrel 'top' half and a β-hairpin triplet 'bottom' half, resulting from gene duplication events (Bernett2004An). The primary structure of FGF1 includes 154 or 140 amino acids, with three cysteine residues at positions 16, 83, and 117, which do not form disulfide bonds (Culajay2000Thermodynamic). 

FGF1's tertiary structure is defined by its β-trefoil fold, which is a result of three 'trefoil' subdomains, each contributing to the protein's overall symmetry and function (Bernett2004An). The protein exhibits low thermal stability due to core-packing defects, with nine cavities identified within its hydrophobic core (Bernett2004An). 

FGF1 is known for its ability to bind all seven FGFRs, attributed to its structural adaptability, particularly in the bC'-bE loop region, which allows it to overcome specificity barriers set by alternative splicing (Belov2013Molecular). The protein does not have a quaternary structure as it functions as a monomer. There is no mention of specific post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms in the provided context.

## Function
Fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) is a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, including metabolism, angiogenesis, and tissue repair. In healthy human cells, FGF1 plays a crucial role in the regulation of metabolism, particularly in adipose tissue and the brain. It is upregulated in response to dietary stress and is essential for maintaining metabolic equilibrium and insulin sensitivity by supporting the recruitment and maturation of preadipocytes, a process known as hyperplasia (Gasser2022Metabolic). FGF1 acts as an anti-lipolytic factor in adipocytes, promoting preadipocyte differentiation and suppressing lipolysis through a paracrine signaling pathway involving FGFR1 and phosphodiesterase 4D (Gasser2022Metabolic).

FGF1 is also involved in the modulation of hematopoietic stem cells, where it supports the expansion and maintenance of these cells by signaling through FGFRs (de2003In). In the context of lung fibrosis, FGF1 has protective effects on alveolar epithelial cells, inhibiting myofibroblast differentiation and preserving epithelial integrity, which may limit fibrosis progression (Shimbori2016Fibroblast).

FGF1 is unique among the FGF family due to its ability to activate all four FGFRs and their isoforms, initiating signaling pathways such as PI3K-AKT, Ras-MAPK, and STAT3, which regulate cell survival, proliferation, and metabolism (Gasser2022Metabolic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the FGF1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NS-CL/P), mutations in FGF1, along with other genes, contribute to the etiology of this congenital disorder. The FGF1 rs34010 C>A polymorphism has been associated with susceptibility to NS-CL/P, with certain genotypes showing a protective effect against the condition (Rafiqdoost2014Investigation).

In endometriosis and adenomyosis, the FGF1 -1385A/G polymorphism has been studied for its potential role in disease risk. Although no significant differences were found in adenomyosis, the A/G + A/A genotype was associated with a reduced risk of developing endometriosis (Kang2010Association).

FGF1 is also involved in preeclampsia, where the rs34011 polymorphism has been linked to an increased risk of the condition. This association is thought to be due to increased expression of FGF1 in glomerular mesangial and endothelial cells, contributing to hypertension (Marwa2016FGF1).

In selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR), FGF1 is targeted by miR-210-3p, which is upregulated under hypoxic conditions. This interaction suppresses trophoblast proliferation and invasiveness, potentially leading to impaired placentation (Li2019miRNA‐210‐3p).

## Interactions
FGF1 interacts with several proteins and proteoglycans, playing a crucial role in cellular signaling. It binds to fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), including FGFR1 and FGFR4, which are essential for its signaling functions. This interaction leads to receptor dimerization and activation of downstream signaling pathways such as Ras/MAPK, PI3K/Akt, and PLCγ (Zakrzewska2008FGF1:). FGF1 also interacts with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), which stabilize its binding to FGFRs and facilitate the formation of active receptor complexes (Zakrzewska2008FGF1:).

The protein can bind to proteoglycans CD44 and CSPG4 on the cell surface. These interactions are mediated through FGF1's heparin-binding sites and can be outcompeted by heparin, suggesting that CD44 and CSPG4 may serve as storage molecules for FGF1 at the cell surface (Zhen2018Proximity). FGF1's interaction with CD44 does not directly influence FGF1-mediated signaling, as CD44 knockdown does not affect ERK1/2 activation (Zhen2018Proximity).

FGF1 also forms a complex with synaptotagmin 1 and S100A13, which is involved in its non-classical secretion pathway under stress conditions (Zakrzewska2008FGF1:). These interactions highlight FGF1's multifaceted role in cellular processes through its binding with various proteins and proteoglycans.
