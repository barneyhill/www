# ZNF232

## Overview
ZNF232 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 232, which is categorized as a transcription factor due to its role in regulating gene expression. The protein is characterized by the presence of a SCAN/LeR domain and five C2H2-type zinc fingers, which facilitate its binding to specific DNA sequences, thereby influencing transcriptional activity (Mavrogiannis2001ZNF232:). ZNF232 is expressed in various human tissues, with notable expression in the liver, testis, and ovary, suggesting it may have tissue-specific functions (Mavrogiannis2001ZNF232:). The gene is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that may contribute to its functional diversity. While initial studies indicate that ZNF232 might be a weak transcriptional regulator, its full range of functions in human biology is not yet completely understood (Mavrogiannis2001ZNF232:).

## Function
ZNF232 is a zinc finger protein that functions primarily as a transcription factor, influencing gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. It contains a SCAN/LeR domain and five C2H2-type zinc fingers, which are indicative of its role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation (Mavrogiannis2001ZNF232:). The protein is predicted to have a nuclear localization signal within the fifth zinc finger repeat, suggesting its activity is localized in the nucleus where it modulates the transcriptional landscape of the cell (Mavrogiannis2001ZNF232:).

ZNF232 is expressed in a variety of adult human tissues, with higher expression levels observed in the liver, testis, and ovary, indicating potential roles in tissue-specific functions (Mavrogiannis2001ZNF232:). The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in two transcript variants that may lead to isoforms differing by nine amino acids, which could contribute to its functional diversity across different tissues (Mavrogiannis2001ZNF232:).

Although experiments in COS-7 and NIH-3T3 cells did not show significant changes in transcriptional activity, suggesting ZNF232 might be a weak transcriptional regulator, its precise function in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated (Mavrogiannis2001ZNF232:).
