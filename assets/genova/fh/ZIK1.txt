# ZIK1

## Overview
ZIK1 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein interacting with K protein 1, a transcriptional repressor involved in various cellular processes. The protein is characterized by a KRAB-A domain and multiple zinc finger motifs, which facilitate its role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. ZIK1 interacts with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K), a key player in signal transduction and gene expression, and this interaction is modulated by specific nucleic acid sequences. The protein is predominantly expressed in glomerular epithelial cells, ovaries, and liver, indicating its potential role in tissue-specific transcriptional regulation. ZIK1 is implicated in several cancers, including liver cancer, where it is part of a regulatory network involving microRNAs and long noncoding RNAs, highlighting its significance in oncogenesis and as a potential therapeutic target (Denisenko1996Zik1; Xu2024m6A).

## Structure
The ZIK1 protein, encoded by the ZIK1 gene, is characterized by a primary structure consisting of 463 amino acids, with a molecular weight of 52,778 and an isoelectric point (pI) of 8.5 (Denisenko1996Zik1). The protein features a KRAB-A domain in its N-terminal region, specifically between amino acids 14-47, which is known for mediating transcriptional repression (Denisenko1996Zik1). The C-terminal region of ZIK1, spanning amino acids 215-463, contains nine contiguous zinc finger motifs that resemble the C2H2 zinc finger consensus sequence, a common structural motif involved in DNA binding (Denisenko1996Zik1).

The interaction of ZIK1 with the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) protein has been confirmed, with the binding site on the K protein mapped to the 209-337 amino acid domain (Denisenko1996Zik1). This interaction is regulated by nucleic acids, as poly(C) RNA and certain DNA motifs can block ZIK1's binding to the K protein (Denisenko1996Zik1). The protein's role as a transcriptional repressor is further supported by its ability to repress transcription of a luciferase reporter gene in cell lines (Denisenko1996Zik1).

## Function
ZIK1, a zinc finger protein, functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor in human cells. It contains a Kruppel-associated box (KRAB-A) domain, which is known to mediate transcriptional repression, and nine contiguous zinc finger motifs typical of DNA-binding proteins (Denisenko1996Zik1). ZIK1 interacts with the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle K protein (hnRNP K), a versatile protein that acts as a docking platform for various molecular interactions involved in signal transduction and gene expression (Denisenko1996Zik1). This interaction is regulated by nucleic acids, as specific RNA and DNA sequences can block their interaction, suggesting that the function of K protein is modulated by its binding to nucleic acids (Denisenko1996Zik1).

ZIK1's role in transcriptional repression has been demonstrated through experiments where a fusion of ZIK1 with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain repressed transcription of a luciferase reporter gene, indicating its function as a transcriptional repressor from cognate DNA elements (Denisenko1996Zik1). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA or RNA, affecting processes like cell growth and development (Denisenko1996Zik1). The highest expression levels of ZIK1 are found in glomerular epithelial cells, with significant expression in ovaries and liver, suggesting a role in tissue-specific transcriptional regulation (Denisenko1996Zik1).

## Clinical Significance
ZIK1 (zinc finger protein interacting with K protein 1) has been implicated in various cancers, including liver cancer, where its expression is regulated by a complex network involving m6A methyltransferase METTL14, lncRNA RP1-228H13.5, and miR-205-5p. In liver cancer, RP1-228H13.5 is significantly upregulated, promoting cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion while inhibiting apoptosis. This lncRNA targets miR-205-5p, which in turn regulates ZIK1 expression, forming a signaling axis that contributes to liver cancer progression (Xu2024m6A).

The study suggests that overexpression of RP1-228H13.5 leads to increased ZIK1 expression, while miR-205-5p overexpression reduces ZIK1 expression, indicating a regulatory mechanism where RP1-228H13.5 modulates ZIK1 through miR-205-5p. This interaction is significant in liver cancer, affecting cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis (Xu2024m6A). Additionally, ZIK1 is associated with other cancers, such as renal cell carcinoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, suggesting its broader role in oncogenesis (Xu2024m6A). The miR-197-3p/ZIK1 axis is also highlighted as a potential therapeutic target for liver cancer, underscoring the clinical significance of ZIK1 in cancer treatment strategies (Xu2024m6A).

## Interactions
ZIK1, or zinc finger protein interacting with K protein 1, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma, ZIK1 is directly targeted by microRNA-197-3p, which binds to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of ZIK1, leading to the suppression of its protein expression through translational repression (Ni2018MicroRNA‑197‑3p). This interaction suggests a regulatory role of miR-197-3p in modulating ZIK1's function in cancer cell behavior.

In liver cancer, ZIK1 is part of a regulatory axis involving the long noncoding RNA RP1-228H13.5 and miR-205-5p. RP1-228H13.5 targets miR-205-5p, which in turn regulates ZIK1 expression. The dual-luciferase and RNA pull-down assays confirmed that miR-205-5p binds to both RP1-228H13.5 and ZIK1, indicating a complex regulatory network that influences ZIK1 expression and potentially affects cancer progression (Xu2024m6A).

ZIK1's interactions are not limited to nucleic acids; it also participates in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades in cotton. ZIK1 interacts with MKK5 and MKK10_1, forming part of novel MAPK signaling modules that respond to various stressors and hormones, highlighting its role in signal transduction pathways (Zhang2018Identification).
