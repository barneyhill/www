# ACTL7B

## Overview
ACTL7B is a gene that encodes the actin-like 7B protein, which is a member of the actin-related protein family. This protein is primarily involved in the process of spermiogenesis, where it plays a critical role in the structural and functional development of sperm cells. Actin-like 7B is specifically expressed in the testis, particularly in the cytoplasm and nuclei of round and elongating spermatids, and is localized to key regions such as the acrosome and the flagellum connecting region. Its involvement in cytoskeletal dynamics is essential for the morphogenic changes that occur during spermatid development, contributing to the structural integrity of the sperm flagellum (Clement2023Actinrelated). The gene's expression is tightly regulated during development, underscoring its importance in male fertility. Mutations or altered expression of ACTL7B have been linked to male infertility, highlighting its clinical significance in reproductive health (Merges2022Actl7bdeficiency; Davalieva2022Comparative).

## Function
The ACTL7B gene encodes an actin-related protein that plays a crucial role in spermiogenesis, the process of sperm development. This protein is specifically expressed in spermatids during the elongation phase of their development and is localized to the developing acrosome, the nucleus of early spermatids, and the flagellum connecting region (Clement2023Actinrelated). ACTL7B is involved in cytoskeletal dynamics, which are essential for the structural and functional changes during spermatid morphogenesis (Clement2023Actinrelated). 

In healthy human cells, ACTL7B is primarily expressed in the testis, particularly in the cytoplasm and nuclei of round and elongating spermatids, but not in other testicular cells or mature sperm (Clement2023Actinrelated). The protein's localization to the acrosomal region and the connecting piece between the head and flagella of elongating spermatids suggests its involvement in maintaining the structural integrity of the sperm flagellum, particularly the connecting piece, axoneme, and mitochondrial sheath (Clement2023Actinrelated). The gene's expression is developmentally regulated, indicating its critical role in the morphogenic changes that transform spermatids into fertilization-competent sperm (Clement2023Actinrelated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ACTL7B gene have been implicated in male infertility. In mice, the absence of ACTL7B leads to male infertility due to severe defects in spermatid development, including detached acrosomes, disrupted membranes, and failed axoneme elongation, which result in spermatogenic arrest (Merges2022Actl7bdeficiency). These defects are similar to those observed in human cases of oligoteratozoospermia and multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagellum, conditions that are leading causes of idiopathic male infertility (Clement2023Actinrelated).

In humans, ACTL7B is expressed exclusively in the testis, and lower expression levels have been observed in teratozoospermic men, suggesting a link to fertility issues (Merges2022Actl7bdeficiency). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ACTL7B have been identified in infertile male patients, indicating a potential causative role in male infertility (Clement2023Actinrelated). ACTL7B is also suggested as a marker for distinguishing between obstructive and non-obstructive azoospermia subtypes, with significant reductions in protein levels observed in patients with hypospermatogenesis and Sertoli cell-only syndrome compared to those with obstructive azoospermia (Davalieva2022Comparative). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ACTL7B in male reproductive health.
