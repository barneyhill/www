# PDHB

## Overview
The PDHB gene encodes the pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 subunit beta, a critical component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex, which plays a pivotal role in cellular energy metabolism. This protein is categorized as an enzyme subunit and is integral to the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, a key step linking glycolysis to the citric acid cycle in mitochondria (Koike1990Molecular). The PDHB protein forms a heterotetrameric structure with the E1 alpha subunit, contributing to the structural and functional integrity of the PDH complex (Prajapati2024Structural). Mutations in the PDHB gene can lead to metabolic disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular function (Robinson1993Lacticacidemia). Additionally, PDHB has been implicated in various cancers, where its expression levels can influence tumor progression and patient prognosis (Rong2024Analysis; Wang2023Cuproptosisa).

## Structure
The PDHB gene encodes the beta subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex, which is essential for the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA in cellular respiration. The PDHB protein is part of a heterotetrameric structure, composed of two alpha and two beta subunits, forming the E1 component of the PDH complex (Rong2024Analysis; Prajapati2024Structural). The beta subunit is encoded by the PDHB gene located on chromosome 3 and is involved in forming the active site of the enzyme, which includes thiamine diphosphate (ThDP) and magnesium ions (Prajapati2024Structural).

The PDHB protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which regulate its activity. This modification is linked to its stability and degradation, as increased tyrosine phosphorylation enhances ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation (Kanda2015ATP6AP2(Pro)renin page 5 of 7). The protein's structure allows it to bind to the pyrimidine portion of ThDP, which is crucial for its enzymatic function (Prajapati2024Structural).

PDHB is also involved in electrostatic interactions with other components of the PDH complex, contributing to its tight association with a low dissociation constant, indicating strong binding affinity (Prajapati2024Structural).

## Function
The PDHB gene encodes the beta subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex, which is essential for cellular respiration and energy metabolism in healthy human cells. The PDH complex catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, a critical step linking glycolysis to the citric acid cycle in mitochondria (Koike1990Molecular). This conversion is vital for energy production, as acetyl-CoA enters the citric acid cycle, leading to the generation of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation.

The PDHB subunit, along with the PDHa subunit, forms a tetrameric structure (a2b2) that contributes to the structural integrity of the PDH complex. It facilitates the binding of PDH to the structural core formed by dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase, another component of the complex (Koike1990Molecular). The beta subunit is suggested to play a role in the catalytic mechanism of the PDH complex, with specific conserved residues being crucial for its function (Robinson1993Lacticacidemia).

Mutations in the PDHB gene can lead to PDH deficiency, resulting in metabolic disorders and neurological diseases due to impaired energy production (Koike1990Molecular). The PDHB gene's structure and expression are therefore critical for maintaining normal cellular and organismal function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PDHB gene can lead to pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, a condition characterized by lactic acidosis, neurological dysfunction, and developmental delays. A specific missense mutation, c.575G>T (p.Arg192Leu), has been identified as pathogenic, significantly reducing PDH protein expression and activity, which contributes to the clinical symptoms observed in affected individuals (Li2024A).

Alterations in PDHB expression levels are also implicated in various cancers. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), PDHB is identified as a biomarker inversely associated with cancer progression. Its up-regulation inhibits cancer cell invasion and is linked to better clinical outcomes (Wang2023Cuproptosisa). In contrast, in liver cancer, increased PDHB expression is associated with reduced immune cell activity and enhanced tumor proliferation, suggesting a complex role in cancer biology (Rong2024Analysis).

PDHB expression is correlated with tumor mutation burden and microsatellite instability in certain cancers, influencing cancer prognosis and treatment response. Its expression is also linked to immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint regulation, impacting tumor microenvironment and immune escape mechanisms (Rong2024Analysis; Wang2023Cuproptosisa).

## Interactions
The pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 subunit beta (PDHB) is a component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), which plays a crucial role in converting pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. PDHB interacts with the E1 alpha subunit to form the E1 enzyme, a key part of the PDC. This complex also includes other components such as E2 (dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase) and E3 (dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase) (Qi2018Characterization).

In Mycoplasma species, PDHB has been identified as a surface-exposed protein that interacts with host extracellular matrix proteins, including plasminogen. This interaction is significant for bacterial adhesion and invasion, although PDHB is not the major plasminogen-binding protein in Mycoplasma gallisepticum (Qi2018Characterization; Thomas2013Characterization). In Mycoplasma pneumoniae, PDHB binds to plasminogen in a concentration-dependent manner, and a specific 12 amino acid region within PDHB is responsible for this binding (Thomas2013Characterization).

PDHB also interacts with ATP6AP2, a (pro)renin receptor, which stabilizes PDHB and influences glucose metabolism. This interaction has been confirmed through various experimental approaches, including yeast two-hybrid analyses and immunoprecipitation (Kanda2015ATP6AP2(Pro)renin page 1 of 7; Kanda2015ATP6AP2(Pro)renin page 3 of 7).
