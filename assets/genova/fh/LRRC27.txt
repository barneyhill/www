# LRRC27

## Overview
LRRC27 is a gene that encodes the protein leucine-rich repeat-containing 27, which is characterized by the presence of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs. These motifs are typically involved in protein-protein interactions, suggesting that LRRC27 may play a role in cellular signaling or structural organization. Although the precise biological functions of the LRRC27 protein remain to be fully elucidated, it has been implicated in several physiological and pathological processes. Notably, LRRC27 expression has been associated with conditions such as preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, and lung squamous cell carcinoma, where its expression levels correlate with disease outcomes (de2022Proteomics; Wu2023Network). Additionally, variations in DNA methylation of the LRRC27 gene have been linked to weight-loss success, indicating a potential regulatory role in metabolic processes (Keller2020DNA). Despite these associations, the specific molecular interactions and pathways involving LRRC27 remain largely unexplored, warranting further research to clarify its functional roles.

## Interactions
LRRC27 (leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 27) is a protein that has been identified in various studies, but its specific interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not well-documented. In the context of preeclampsia and gestational hypertension, LRRC27 was found to be upregulated in proteomics data, suggesting its potential involvement in these conditions. However, the interactions of LRRC27 with other proteins in this context remain largely unexplored (de2022Proteomics).

In a study investigating DNA methylation differences related to weight loss, LRRC27 was identified as having significantly lower methylation in individuals who successfully lost weight compared to those who did not. This suggests a potential role in weight-loss success, but specific protein interactions involving LRRC27 were not detailed (Keller2020DNA).

In the context of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), LRRC27 was identified as one of the genes with higher expression correlating with worse overall survival. However, the study did not provide specific information on protein interactions involving LRRC27 (Wu2023Network).

Overall, while LRRC27 is implicated in various biological processes and conditions, detailed information on its physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids is currently lacking.
