# CCIN

## Overview
The CCIN gene encodes the protein calicin, which is a critical component of the perinuclear theca in spermatozoa. Calicin is an actin-binding protein characterized by the presence of kelch repeats and a BTB/POZ domain, which facilitate its structural role in the sperm head (Lécuyer2000ActinBinding). It is primarily expressed in the testis and plays a vital role in spermatogenesis, particularly in the morphological transformation of spermatids into mature spermatozoa. Calicin is essential for the formation of the acrosome-acroplaxome-manchette complex, contributing to sperm head shaping and structural integrity (Yan2022Calicin). Mutations in the CCIN gene can lead to structural abnormalities in sperm, such as deformed sperm heads, which are associated with male infertility (Yan2022Calicin). The protein's interactions with other proteins in the acrosomal membrane and nuclear envelope are crucial for maintaining the structural organization necessary for proper sperm function (Müjica2003Perinuclear).

## Structure
Calicin, encoded by the CCIN gene, is a protein primarily involved in the structural organization of the sperm head. It is characterized by the presence of three kelch repeats and a BTB/POZ domain, which are crucial for its function as an actin-binding protein (Lécuyer2000ActinBinding). The protein has a molecular weight of approximately 60 kDa and an isoelectric point of around pH 8 (Lécuyer2000ActinBinding). 

Calicin forms homomultimers, including tetramers and higher-order polymers, which contribute to its structural role in the sperm head (Lécuyer2000ActinBinding). The protein's ability to bind F-actin with high affinity, at a stoichiometry of one calicin per 12 actin monomers, is a key feature of its function in the perinuclear theca of spermatozoa (Müjica2003Perinuclear; Lécuyer2000ActinBinding). 

Mutations in the CCIN gene, particularly those affecting the BTB domain and Kelch motif, have been linked to structural abnormalities in sperm, such as deformed sperm heads, highlighting the importance of these domains in maintaining proper protein function (Yan2022Calicin). The protein is highly conserved across species, with a 93% sequence similarity between mice and humans (Yan2022Calicin).

## Function
Calicin (CCIN) is a protein encoded by the CCIN gene, primarily expressed in the testis, where it plays a crucial role in spermatogenesis. It is a major component of the perinuclear theca (PT), a cytoskeletal structure surrounding the sperm nucleus, and is involved in the morphological transformation of round spermatids into mature spermatozoa. Calicin is essential for the formation of the acrosome-acroplaxome-manchette complex, which is critical for sperm head shaping (Yan2022Calicin; Müjica2003Perinuclear).

Calicin interacts with various proteins localized in the inner acrosomal membrane and nuclear envelope, such as CAPZB and GSTO2, to establish the IAM-acroplaxome-NE structure during nuclear elongation and acrosome development (Yan2022Calicin). It binds actin filaments, contributing to the structural organization of the acrosome and the postacrosomal region of elongated spermatids (Oud2020Exome; Müjica2003Perinuclear).

In healthy human cells, calicin's role in maintaining the structural integrity of the sperm head is crucial for proper sperm morphology and motility, which are essential for male fertility. Mutations in the CCIN gene can lead to sperm head deformation and male infertility, although the paternal genome integrity remains intact (Yan2022Calicin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the CCIN gene, which encodes the protein calicin, have been implicated in various male infertility conditions. Calicin is involved in sperm head shaping, and its mislocalization or altered expression can lead to significant fertility issues. In Cylicin-deficient mice, CCIN is mislocalized, which suggests that proper localization of calicin is crucial for maintaining sperm structure and function (Schneider2023Cylicins). This mislocalization is associated with morphological anomalies in sperm, contributing to male infertility (Schneider2023Cylicins).

CCIN has also been identified as a potential candidate gene in the pathogenesis of globozoospermia, a condition characterized by round-headed spermatozoa lacking an acrosome, leading to fertilization failures (Graziani2024Genetic). The involvement of CCIN in globozoospermia suggests that mutations or altered expression levels of this gene may disrupt the normal acrosome formation and attachment, impacting sperm's ability to penetrate the zona pellucida.

Overall, the clinical significance of CCIN in male fertility is underscored by its role in maintaining sperm head integrity and its potential involvement in conditions like globozoospermia, highlighting the need for further research to fully understand its impact on male reproductive health.

## Interactions
Calicin (CCIN) is a protein that plays a crucial role in sperm head shaping and structural integrity during spermiogenesis. It interacts with various proteins localized in the inner acrosomal membrane (IAM) and nuclear envelope (NE), which are essential for sperm head shaping. These interactions include acroplaxome proteins such as CAPZB, GSTO2, ACTRT1, ACTRT2, and ACTL7A, IAM protein SPACA1, and NE proteins like DPY19L2, FAM209, PARP11, SPATA46, and LBR (Yan2022Calicin). Calicin is also a major component of the perinuclear theca (PT) in spermatozoa, where it binds to actin filaments with high affinity, suggesting a role in maintaining the structural integrity of the PT (Müjica2003Perinuclear). 

Calicin's interactions are critical for establishing the IAM-acroplaxome-NE structure during nuclear elongation and acrosome development. Disruptions in these interactions, such as the loss of PARP11 or SPATA46, lead to NE instability and aberrant acroplaxome structures, respectively (Yan2022Calicin). Additionally, calicin is involved in the IAM-PT-NE complex, establishing bidirectional connections with other PT proteins, which are essential for the proper function of PT proteins (Schneider2023Cylicins).
