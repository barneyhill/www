# CREG1

## Overview
CREG1 (cellular repressor of E1A stimulated genes 1) is a gene that encodes a glycoprotein involved in various cellular processes, including lysosomal biogenesis and function. The CREG1 protein is characterized by its structural similarity to oxidoreductases, although it lacks enzymatic activity due to its inability to bind flavin mononucleotide (FMN) (Sacher2005The; Ghobrial2018The). It is primarily localized to the endosomal-lysosomal compartment, where it enhances endocytic trafficking and promotes lysosomal biogenesis (Liu2021CREG1). CREG1 interacts with several proteins, including the mannose-6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptor (M6P/IGF2R), and functions as a transcriptional repressor of E2F transcriptional activation (Moolmuang2011CREG1; Di2003The). Clinically, alterations in CREG1 expression have been linked to various diseases, such as alcohol-associated liver disease, diabetic cardiomyopathy, obesity, and non-small cell lung cancer, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Clark2016Glycoproteomic; Tian2017CREG1; Wu2022Hepatocytespecific; Liu2023The).

## Structure
The CREG1 protein is a 220 amino acid glycoprotein that exhibits structural similarities to oxidoreductases but lacks enzymatic activity due to its inability to bind flavin mononucleotide (FMN) (Sacher2005The; Ghobrial2018The). The primary structure includes a signal peptide at the N-terminus, which is cleaved during maturation (Ghobrial2018The). The secondary structure of CREG1 features an α/β fold with a β-barrel structure, consisting of six long, twisted strands forming an antiparallel β-barrel, interspersed with several α-helices (Sacher2005The).

The tertiary structure reveals a split β-barrel fold, similar to FMN-binding proteins, although the FMN-binding site is blocked by a loop and bulky residues, rendering it non-functional for FMN binding (Sacher2005The). CREG1 forms tightly bound homodimers, with a hydrophobic dimer interface that facilitates dimerization, covering a significant portion of the surface area (Sacher2005The; Ghobrial2018The).

Post-translational modifications include N-linked glycosylation at three sites, which are crucial for its interaction with the mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptor (M6P/IGF2R) (Schähs2008Cellular; Ghobrial2018The). These modifications involve phosphorylated N-glycans, such as mannose-6-phosphate, which are essential for CREG1's lysosomal targeting and retention (Schähs2008Cellular).

## Function
The CREG1 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in lysosomal biogenesis and function in healthy human cells. CREG1 is primarily localized to the endosomal-lysosomal compartment, where it enhances macropinocytosis and clathrin-dependent endocytosis, promoting the acidification of this compartment and increasing lysosomal biogenesis (Liu2021CREG1). This protein facilitates endocytic trafficking, which is crucial for the internalization and degradation of cellular and extracellular materials (Liu2021CREG1). Overexpression of CREG1 enhances autophagy and lysosome-mediated degradation, while its knockdown or knockout has the opposite effect, indicating its role in promoting autophagic flux and lysosomal function (Liu2021CREG1).

CREG1 interacts with the insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor (IGF2R), which is involved in the transport of lysosomal enzymes, although this interaction does not significantly impact enzyme delivery (Liu2021CREG1). The protein is highly expressed in various tissues, including the liver, lung, and immune organs, and is involved in nutrient uptake and degradation, particularly during early embryonic development (Liu2021CREG1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CREG1 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), elevated levels of CREG1 are observed in patients and animal models. Hepatocyte-specific deletion of CREG1 exacerbates ethanol-induced liver injury, apoptosis, steatosis, and inflammation, suggesting that CREG1 plays a protective role by inhibiting the ASK1-JNK/p38 stress kinase pathway (Wu2022Hepatocytespecific).

In diabetic cardiomyopathy, CREG1 deficiency worsens cardiac dysfunction, myocardial hypertrophy, fibrosis, and autophagy dysfunction. Overexpression of CREG1 improves these conditions by promoting autophagy in cardiomyocytes, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Liu2023The).

CREG1 is also involved in obesity and insulin resistance. Creg1 haploinsufficiency in mice leads to increased susceptibility to high-fat diet-induced obesity, liver steatosis, and insulin resistance, with heightened inflammation mediated by the NF-κB pathway (Tian2017CREG1).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), CREG1 acts as a positive regulator of cell proliferation and migration, particularly in KRAS-mutant cells, indicating its role in cancer progression (Clark2016Glycoproteomic).

## Interactions
CREG1 is a secreted glycoprotein that interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular growth and differentiation. It was initially identified through its interaction with the Drosophila TATA-binding protein (TBP) and has been shown to bind to Rb-family pocket proteins, including pRb/p105, RbL1/p107, and RbL2/p130, functioning as a transcriptional repressor of E2F transcriptional activation (Moolmuang2011CREG1).

CREG1 also interacts with the mannose-6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptor (M6P/IGF2R), a multifunctional receptor involved in regulating cell growth. This interaction is dependent on the glycosylation of CREG1, and the presence of M6P/IGF2R is necessary for CREG1-mediated growth inhibition (Di2003The). The binding of CREG1 to M6P/IGF2R has been confirmed through various biochemical assays, including Far-Western blotting and coimmunoprecipitation (Sacher2005The; Liu2021CREG1).

CREG1 is also involved in lysosomal biogenesis and function, where it promotes lysosomal protein expression through enhanced endocytic trafficking. This role is supported by its interaction with IGF2R, which is relevant to lysosomal biogenesis (Liu2021CREG1).
