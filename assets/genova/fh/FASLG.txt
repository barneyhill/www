# FASLG

## Overview
The FASLG gene encodes the Fas ligand (FasL), a type II transmembrane protein that is a crucial member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily. FasL is primarily involved in the regulation of apoptosis, particularly within the immune system, where it plays a vital role in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing autoimmune diseases. The protein is predominantly expressed on the surface of activated T cells and interacts with the Fas receptor (CD95) on target cells to induce programmed cell death. This interaction is essential for the clonal deletion of autoreactive T cells and the elimination of activated lymphocytes following an immune response, thereby preventing the accumulation of potentially harmful cells (Strasser2009The; Nagata1995The). Additionally, FasL contributes to immune privilege in certain tissues by inducing apoptosis in infiltrating inflammatory cells, thus protecting sensitive tissues from immune-mediated damage (Griffith1995Fas). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its involvement in various autoimmune and oncological conditions, where alterations in FasL expression or function can lead to disease pathogenesis (Zhang2005Functional; Wu1996Fas).

## Structure
The Fas ligand (FasL) is a type II transmembrane protein and a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily. Its primary structure consists of a polypeptide chain with several phosphorylation sites, including a casein kinase I (CKI) substrate motif, and an extended proline-rich domain (PRD) in its intracellular portion (Voss2008Posttranslational). The secondary structure includes a TNF homology domain (THD) in the ectodomain, which is crucial for binding to the Fas receptor (Voss2008Posttranslational). The tertiary structure involves the folding of the protein into a three-dimensional shape, although no crystallographic or NMR data are available for FasL (Voss2008Posttranslational).

FasL functions as a homotrimeric complex, with oligomerization dependent on a self-assembly region in the ectodomain (Hahne1995Characterization). The protein contains three putative N-linked glycosylation sites, which are important for its maturation and stability (Voss2008Posttranslational). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitylation affect FasL sorting to secretory lysosomes (Voss2008Posttranslational). The proline-rich domain allows for interactions with SH3 and WW domains, influencing FasL function and reverse signaling in T cells (Voss2008Posttranslational).

## Function
The FASLG gene encodes the Fas ligand (FasL), a protein that plays a critical role in the regulation of apoptosis, particularly within the immune system. FasL is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family and is primarily expressed on the surface of activated T cells. It interacts with its receptor, Fas (CD95), on target cells to induce apoptosis, a process essential for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing autoimmune diseases (Strasser2009The; Nagata1995The).

In healthy human cells, the Fas-FasL interaction is crucial for the clonal deletion of autoreactive T cells and the elimination of activated lymphocytes after an immune response. This mechanism prevents the accumulation of potentially harmful lymphocytes, which could lead to autoimmune conditions (Nagata1995The). The FasL protein can trigger apoptotic cell death by cross-linking with Fas, leading to characteristic cytoplasmic and nuclear changes (Nagata1995The).

FasL is also involved in maintaining immune privilege in certain tissues, such as the eye, by inducing apoptosis in infiltrating inflammatory cells, thereby preventing tissue damage (Griffith1995Fas). This function highlights its role in protecting sensitive tissues from immune-mediated damage.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FASLG gene, which encodes the Fas ligand, have significant clinical implications. In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a mutation in the FasL gene can lead to reduced apoptosis signaling, contributing to lymphoproliferative disease. This is characterized by increased lymphadenopathy and is linked to autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) (Wu1996Fas). The mutation results in an 84-base pair deletion in exon 4, causing a truncation of the FasL protein's extracellular domain, which impairs normal apoptotic processes (Wu1996Fas).

Polymorphisms in the FasL gene promoter, such as the -844C allele, are associated with higher FasL expression and have been linked to an increased risk of autoimmune diseases like SLE, particularly in African American populations (Wu2003A). These genetic variations can affect immune tolerance and apoptosis, contributing to disease pathogenesis.

In cancer, alterations in FasL expression are implicated in immune evasion by tumor cells. Increased FasL expression is associated with various cancers, including lung cancer, where specific polymorphisms in the FasL gene are linked to increased cancer risk (Zhang2005Functional). These findings underscore the role of FASLG in both autoimmune and oncological conditions.

## Interactions
FASLG (Fas ligand) is a type-2 transmembrane protein that primarily interacts with the Fas receptor (FAS) to induce apoptosis. This interaction is crucial for the formation of receptor microaggregates, which recruit the adapter molecule Fas-associated death domain (FADD) through homotypic interactions via their death domains. FADD subsequently recruits procaspase 8, forming the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), which activates caspase 8 and initiates the caspase cascade leading to apoptosis (VillaMorales2012Targeting).

FASLG can also exist in a soluble form (sFasL), which is generated through proteolysis by metalloproteinases. While sFasL does not activate Fas as effectively as the membrane-bound form, it has been shown to interact with death receptor 5 (DR5), a Fas-independent receptor. This interaction promotes inflammation by enhancing the transcription of the chemokine CX3CL1 in fibroblast-like synoviocytes, potentially contributing to the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (Jeong2021Soluble).

In cancer therapy, FASLG has been engineered into fusion proteins like Fc:FasL and MegaFasL, which form hexameric structures to enhance apoptotic activity. These fusion proteins can act synergistically with chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy, offering potential therapeutic benefits (VillaMorales2012Targeting).
