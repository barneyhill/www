# SYCE3

## Overview
SYCE3 is a gene that encodes the synaptonemal complex central element protein 3, a critical component of the synaptonemal complex (SC) involved in meiotic chromosome synapsis. The protein is categorized as a structural protein, playing a pivotal role in the assembly and stabilization of the SC by acting as a molecular adapter. It integrates into the SYCP1 lattice, facilitating the recruitment and assembly of other essential protein complexes necessary for the structural maturation of the SC (Crichton2023Structural; Crichton2022Structural). The SYCE3 protein is characterized by its ability to form higher-order oligomers, which are crucial for its function in the SC (Dunne2019A). Mutations in the SYCE3 gene can lead to meiotic failure and infertility, underscoring its essential role in reproductive biology (Crichton2023Structural).

## Structure
SYCE3 is a small protein consisting of 88 amino acids, with a highly conserved sequence among mammals, showing 90% identity between mouse and human (Schramm2011A). The primary structure includes a short coiled-coil motif spanning amino acids 6-39, which is conserved across vertebrates except for fish (Schramm2011A).

The secondary structure of SYCE3 is predominantly α-helical, forming a compact dimeric four-helical bundle. This structure is composed of two intertwined helix-loop-helix chains in an anti-parallel configuration (Dunne2019A). The tertiary structure involves the formation of a homodimer with a molecular weight of approximately 22 kDa, as confirmed by size-exclusion chromatography multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy (Dunne2019A).

In terms of quaternary structure, SYCE3 dimers can self-assemble into higher-order oligomers, such as tetramers, hexamers, dodecamers, and tetraeicosamers. This self-assembly is mediated by specific protein-protein interfaces involving surface-exposed residues like Y11, W41, and W44, which are crucial for the process (Dunne2019A). These interactions allow SYCE3 to form large molecular assemblies, which are essential for its function in the synaptonemal complex (Dunne2019A).

## Function
SYCE3 (synaptonemal complex central element protein 3) is a crucial component of the synaptonemal complex (SC), a protein structure that facilitates homologous chromosome pairing and recombination during meiosis. In healthy human cells, SYCE3 functions as a molecular adapter that integrates into the SYCP1 lattice, a key structural element of the SC. This integration is essential for the recruitment and assembly of other protein complexes, such as SYCE1-SIX6OS1 and SYCE2-TEX12, which are vital for the structural maturation and stability of the SC (Crichton2023Structural; Crichton2022Structural).

SYCE3 actively remodels the SYCP1 lattice by binding to SYCP1 tetramers, causing a conformational change that disrupts the tetramer interface. This disruption is compensated by the self-assembly of SYCE3, forming a new lattice structure that integrates with SYCP1, enabling the formation of a mature SC (Crichton2023Structural; Crichton2022Structural). The interactions involving SYCE3 are characterized by both high- and low-affinity binding interfaces, contributing to the dynamic and cooperative nature of SC assembly (Crichton2022Structural).

The absence of SYCE3 leads to the formation of large SYCP1 foci, indicating its essential role in directing SYCP1 lattices towards inter-homologous synapsis, which is critical for successful meiosis and proper chromosome segregation (Crichton2022Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SYCE3 gene can lead to significant reproductive issues, primarily due to its critical role in the assembly and function of the synaptonemal complex (SC) during meiosis. Disruption of SYCE3 in mice results in synapsis failure, characterized by fragmented recruitment of SYCP1 and a block in meiosis at the pachytene stage, leading to infertility (Crichton2023Structural). Specifically, the SYCE3 WY mutation disrupts the SYCP1 tetramer lattice, causing severe infertility due to failed SC assembly (Crichton2023Structural). 

The absence of SYCE3 also leads to the formation of large axial SYCP1 foci, indicating its essential role in directing SYCP1 lattices towards inter-homologous synapsis (Crichton2023Structural). Although specific human diseases directly linked to SYCE3 mutations are not detailed, the gene's critical function in meiotic chromosome synapsis suggests that mutations could potentially disrupt this process, leading to infertility or subfertility (Llano2023Synaptonemal). Defects in SC assembly, where SYCE3 plays a pivotal role, are associated with human infertility, recurrent miscarriage, and aneuploidy (Dunne2019A).

## Interactions
SYCE3 is a central element protein of the synaptonemal complex (SC) that plays a crucial role in meiotic chromosome synapsis by interacting with various other SC proteins. It binds to the SYCP1 protein through its tetrameric core, forming a 2:1 hetero-trimeric complex, which disrupts the SYCP1 tetramer interface and remodels it into a trimeric coiled-coil structure (Crichton2023Structural; Crichton2022Structural). This interaction is essential for the structural maturation of the SC, as SYCE3 acts as a molecular adapter that integrates into the SYCP1 lattice, facilitating the recruitment and assembly of other core complexes such as SYCE1-SIX6OS1 and SYCE2-TEX12 (Crichton2022Structural).

SYCE3 also interacts with SYCE2-TEX12, promoting their fibrous assembly and contributing to the SC's structural integrity. The binding affinity between SYCE3 and SYCE2-TEX12 is measured at 22 ± 2 µM, indicating dynamic interactions with rapid turnover (Crichton2022Structural). These interactions are crucial for the SC's ability to adapt to mechanical stresses and regulate meiotic recombination, highlighting SYCE3's importance in the structural and functional dynamics of the SC (Crichton2023Structural).
