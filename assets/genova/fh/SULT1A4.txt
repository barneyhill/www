# SULT1A4

## Overview
SULT1A4 is a gene that encodes the enzyme sulfotransferase family 1A member 4, which is part of the cytosolic sulfotransferase (SULT) family. This enzyme is categorized as a sulfotransferase and is primarily involved in the sulfation of monoamines and structurally related compounds, playing a critical role in the metabolism and detoxification of various endogenous and exogenous substances. The protein encoded by SULT1A4 is identical to that encoded by SULT1A3, and together they are responsible for the sulfation of catecholamines such as dopamine and serotonin. SULT1A4 is expressed in several tissues, including the upper gastrointestinal tract, brain, lung, and platelets, with its expression pattern varying significantly during human development. The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and protecting against potentially harmful compounds, and genetic variations in SULT1A4 have been associated with various health disorders (Coughtrie2016Function; Kurogi2021SULT).

## Function
SULT1A4, a member of the human cytosolic sulfotransferase (SULT) family, is involved in the sulfation of monoamines and structurally related compounds. This enzyme plays a crucial role in the metabolism, inactivation, and excretion of various substrates, including catecholamines such as dopamine, serotonin, and isoproterenol (Kurogi2021SULT). SULT1A4, along with SULT1A3, encodes identical protein products, collectively referred to as SULT1A3, and is primarily responsible for the sulfation of catecholamines and other compounds (Kurogi2021SULT).

The enzyme is predominantly expressed in the upper gastrointestinal tract in adult humans, with significant expression also found in the brain, lung, and platelets. Its hepatic expression is high during early fetal development but decreases substantially in late fetal/early neonatal liver and is essentially absent in adult liver (Kurogi2021SULT). The sulfation process mediated by SULT1A4 is essential for the detoxification and elimination of xenobiotics and endogenous small molecules, contributing to cellular homeostasis and protection against potentially harmful compounds (Coughtrie2016Function). Genetic polymorphisms in SULT1A4 have been linked to several pathological disorders, indicating its significant role in human health (Kurogi2021SULT).
