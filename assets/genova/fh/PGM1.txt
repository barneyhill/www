# PGM1

## Overview
Phosphoglucomutase 1 (PGM1) is a gene that encodes the enzyme phosphoglucomutase 1, which is a critical component of glucose metabolism. This enzyme belongs to the phosphotransferase family and is primarily involved in the interconversion of glucose-1-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate, a key step in glycogenolysis and glycolysis (Jin2018Phosphoglucomutase; Wong2016Defining). The PGM1 protein is a monomeric enzyme that functions in the cytoplasm and is essential for maintaining glucose homeostasis and energy production in cells (Balakrishnan2019A). Mutations in the PGM1 gene can lead to PGM1 deficiency, a condition associated with glycogen storage disease type XIV and congenital disorders of glycosylation, which manifest in a variety of clinical symptoms (Altassan2020International; Beamer2014Mutations). The enzyme's activity is regulated through interactions with other proteins and phosphorylation, linking it to broader metabolic and signaling pathways (Doello2021Phosphorylation; Gururaj2004Regulation).

## Structure
Phosphoglucomutase 1 (PGM1) is a monomeric protein composed of 562 amino acids, organized into four structural domains that form a heart-shaped architecture. These domains are arranged in a way that creates a central active site cleft, which is crucial for its enzymatic function (Stiers2016Induced; Beamer2014Mutations). The active site includes a phosphoserine residue, essential for phosphoryl transfer, and is supported by loops that bind metal ions and interact with sugar and phosphate groups (Stiers2016Induced; Stiers2017Biology).

The secondary structure of PGM1 features a mix of α-helices and β-sheets, with a central β-sheet flanked by α-helices in the core domains. The C-terminal domain (D4) has a distinct α+β topology with a TATA-binding protein-like fold (Stiers2017Biology). The protein's tertiary structure is stabilized by interactions among these domains, contributing to its functional integrity.

PGM1 exists in multiple isoforms, with isoform 2 having a longer N-terminal extension compared to isoform 1. This extension is unique to placental mammals and may be structurally disordered (Backe2020Structural). The active sites of both isoforms are nearly identical, with minor differences in specific loops and the D4 domain (Backe2020Structural).

## Function
Phosphoglucomutase 1 (PGM1) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in glucose metabolism by catalyzing the reversible conversion of glucose-1-phosphate (G1P) to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P). This reaction is essential for glycogenolysis and glycolysis, processes vital for maintaining glucose homeostasis in the body (Jin2018Phosphoglucomutase; Wong2016Defining). PGM1 is active in the cytoplasm and is crucial for energy production and storage in cells, impacting overall metabolic homeostasis (Balakrishnan2019A).

PGM1 is involved in the cytoplasmic biosynthesis of nucleotide sugars needed for glycan biosynthesis, playing a key role in protein N-glycosylation, a significant posttranslational modification that affects protein function and stability (Backe2020Structural; Wong2016Defining). The enzyme's activity is necessary for the synthesis of uridine diphosphate glucose, which is used in glycogen synthesis and as a precursor in protein N-glycosylation (Backe2020Structural).

In healthy human cells, PGM1 ensures proper glycosylation of transport proteins, hormones, and coagulation factors, which is critical for normal cellular function and development (Wong2016Defining). Deficiencies in PGM1 can lead to inherited diseases characterized by glycogen storage issues and congenital disorders of glycosylation (Muenks2017Sequencestructure).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PGM1 gene lead to PGM1 deficiency, a condition classified as both a glycogen storage disease type XIV (GSDXIV) and a congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG) (Altassan2020International; Beamer2014Mutations). This autosomal recessive disorder is characterized by a wide range of clinical manifestations, including hypoglycemia, hepatopathy, growth retardation, muscle weakness, and exercise intolerance (Lee2014Compromised; Ding2018Clinical). Patients may also present with congenital malformations such as cleft palate and bifid uvula, as well as severe complications like dilated cardiomyopathy and cardiac arrest (Fernlund2019The; Tegtmeyer2014Multiple).

PGM1 deficiency affects protein glycosylation and glycogen metabolism, leading to impaired glycoprotein production and abnormal glycogen storage (Morava2014Galactose; Yokoi2018Disruption). The disorder can manifest in two major phenotypes: a primary myopathic form and a multisystem form, which may involve cardiac, muscle, and hepatic involvement (Altassan2020International). Galactose supplementation has been shown to improve glycosylation and alleviate some clinical symptoms, although not all symptoms are resolved (Morava2014Galactose; Tegtmeyer2014Multiple). Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for managing the condition effectively (Altassan2020International).

## Interactions
Phosphoglucomutase 1 (PGM1) interacts with several proteins, influencing its activity and role in cellular metabolism. One significant interaction is with the signaling kinase p21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1). Pak1 binds to PGM1 and phosphorylates it at threonine 466, enhancing its enzymatic activity. This interaction is specific to Pak1, as no similar binding is observed with other Pak family members. The phosphorylation by Pak1 increases PGM1's specific activity twofold, linking growth factor signaling with metabolic regulation (Gururaj2004Regulation).

PGM1 also interacts with calphoglin, a protein that enhances its activity. Calphoglin is involved in calcium signaling and forms a complex with PGM1 and inorganic pyrophosphatase (IPP), which is conserved across species. This complex is implicated in cellular metabolism and calcium signaling, suggesting a role in integrating metabolic and signaling pathways (Takahashi2004Cellular).

These interactions highlight PGM1's involvement in multiprotein complexes and its regulation through phosphorylation, affecting its function in glucose metabolism and cellular energy homeostasis. The regulatory mechanisms involving PGM1 are evolutionarily conserved, underscoring its importance in cellular processes (Doello2021Phosphorylation).
