# MTRES1

## Overview
MTRES1, or mitochondrial transcription rescue factor 1, is a gene that encodes a protein crucial for maintaining mitochondrial gene expression, particularly under stress conditions. The protein, categorized as an RNA-binding factor, is primarily active in the mitochondrial matrix, where it plays a significant role in stabilizing mitochondrial RNA (mtRNA) and facilitating mitochondrial transcription and translation processes. MTRES1 interacts with key mitochondrial components, such as mitochondrial RNA polymerase (POLRMT) and transcription initiation factor TFAM, to protect and regulate mitochondrial transcription. It also associates with the mitochondrial ribosome, indicating a role in translation quality control. These functions are vital for the proper assembly of oxidative phosphorylation complexes and overall mitochondrial function (Nadler2024Translation; Kotrys2019Quantitative).

## Function
MTRES1, also known as mitochondrial transcription rescue factor 1, is a crucial protein in human mitochondria that plays a significant role in maintaining mitochondrial gene expression, particularly under stress conditions. It is primarily active in the mitochondrial matrix, where it binds to a broad spectrum of mitochondrial transcripts, including mitochondrial 7S RNA, through its S4 RNA-binding domain (Kotrys2019Quantitative). This RNA-binding ability is essential for its function, as it prevents the loss of mitochondrial RNA (mtRNA) during transcription inhibition (Kotrys2019Quantitative).

MTRES1 interacts with mitochondrial RNA polymerase (POLRMT) and transcription initiation factor TFAM, suggesting its involvement at the transcriptional level to protect mitochondrial transcription (Kotrys2019Quantitative). It does not regulate the stability of 7S RNA but is involved in its production, and its upregulation prevents the decrease of 7S RNA and other mitochondrial RNAs under stress conditions (Kotrys2019Quantitative). MTRES1 also plays a role in the quality control of mitochondrial translation by associating with the mitochondrial large subunit and facilitating the release of stalled peptidyl tRNA, which is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial protein synthesis and proper assembly of oxidative phosphorylation complexes (Nadler2024Translation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the MTRES1 gene can significantly impact mitochondrial function, potentially leading to a range of mitochondrial disorders. These disorders are often characterized by impaired energy production, which can manifest as neuromuscular diseases or metabolic syndromes. Neuromuscular diseases associated with MTRES1 mutations may include conditions that affect muscle strength and coordination, as the mitochondria play a crucial role in energy supply for muscle function. Metabolic syndromes linked to MTRES1 alterations could involve issues with energy metabolism, leading to symptoms such as fatigue, muscle weakness, and exercise intolerance. The specific clinical implications of MTRES1 mutations are still under investigation, as research continues to explore the full spectrum of conditions associated with its dysfunction. Understanding the role of MTRES1 in mitochondrial gene expression is crucial for developing potential therapeutic strategies for these disorders. Further studies are needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which MTRES1 mutations or expression changes contribute to disease pathology, as well as to identify potential targets for intervention.

## Interactions
MTRES1, also known as mitochondrial transcription rescue factor 1, is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids within the mitochondria. It directly interacts with mitochondrial RNA polymerase (POLRMT) in a manner that is not mediated by RNA, suggesting a strong and specific association (Kotrys2019Quantitative). MTRES1 also associates with the transcription initiation factor TFAM, although this interaction is RNA-dependent (Kotrys2019Quantitative). These interactions are crucial for MTRES1's role in maintaining mitochondrial RNA levels, particularly under stress conditions.

MTRES1 binds a broad spectrum of mitochondrial transcripts, including mitochondrial 7S RNA, as confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (Kotrys2019Quantitative). This RNA-binding ability is essential for its function in preventing the loss of mitochondrial RNA during transcriptional stress (Kotrys2019Quantitative). MTRES1 is also associated with the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome, indicating a potential role in mitochondrial translation (Kotrys2019Mitochondrial). These interactions suggest that MTRES1 may coordinate transcription and translation processes, contributing to the regulation of mitochondrial gene expression (JedynakSlyvka2021Human).
