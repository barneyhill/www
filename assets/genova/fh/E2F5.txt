# E2F5

## Overview
E2F5 is a gene that encodes the E2F transcription factor 5, a member of the E2F family of transcription factors, which are pivotal in regulating the cell cycle and cellular proliferation. The E2F5 protein functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor and is involved in maintaining cellular quiescence by forming complexes with retinoblastoma protein (pRB) family members, such as p130 and p107, to repress transcription in quiescent cells (Kothandaraman2010E2F5; DeGregori2002The). Unlike some other E2F family members, E2F5 does not interact with the SP1 transcription factor and is not acetylated by P/CAF, p300/CBP, or related acetyltransferases, indicating a distinct role in transcriptional regulation (DeGregori2002The). E2F5 is also implicated in various cancers, including prostate, breast, and ovarian cancers, where its altered expression is associated with tumorigenic signaling and poor clinical outcomes (Umemura2009Overexpression; Majumder2016Deregulated; Kothandaraman2010E2F5). These characteristics make E2F5 a significant focus of research for its potential as a diagnostic marker and therapeutic target in oncology.

## Structure
The E2F5 protein is a member of the E2F family of transcription factors, characterized by specific structural domains that facilitate its role in cell cycle regulation. E2F5 contains a DNA-binding domain (DB) and regions necessary for heterodimerization with DP proteins, which are crucial for its function in gene expression regulation (Sardet1995E2F4). Unlike some other E2F family members, E2F5 lacks a cyclin A binding domain due to its shorter N terminus (Sardet1995E2F4). 

The protein's primary structure includes a 1035-bp open reading frame encoding a 345-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular weight of 37.5 kDa (Sardet1995E2F4). E2F5 shares a high degree of similarity with E2F-4, with 69% identity and 80% similarity, indicating conserved sequence blocks that correspond to its functional domains (Sardet1995E2F4). 

E2F5 can form heterodimers with DP proteins, which enhances its DNA-binding capability and regulatory functions (Sardet1995E2F4). The interaction with pocket proteins like pRb and p130 has been studied, although E2F5 does not bind to pRb in a two-hybrid assay (Sardet1995E2F4). The protein's structure and interactions suggest its involvement in early phases of the cell cycle, particularly in the G0/G1 transition (Sardet1995E2F4).

## Function
E2F5 is a member of the E2F family of transcription factors, which play a crucial role in regulating the cell cycle, particularly the transition from the G1 to S phase. In healthy human cells, E2F5 functions as a transcriptional repressor, primarily involved in maintaining cellular quiescence and regulating cell cycle progression. It forms complexes with retinoblastoma protein (pRB) family members, such as p130 and p107, to repress transcription in quiescent cells (Kothandaraman2010E2F5; DeGregori2002The).

E2F5 is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it binds to specific DNA sequences to modulate gene expression. Its nuclear localization is dependent on its association with Rb and DP family members (DeGregori2002The). Unlike other E2F family members, E2F5 does not interact with the SP1 transcription factor and is not acetylated by P/CAF, p300/CBP, or related acetyltransferases, indicating a distinct role in transcriptional regulation (DeGregori2002The).

In knockout mouse models, E2F5 has been shown to play a role in modulating secretory activity, as evidenced by the development of hydrocephalus due to increased cerebrospinal fluid secretion by the choroid plexus (DeGregori2002The). This suggests that E2F5 may have non-proliferative roles in certain tissues.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the E2F5 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including prostate, breast, and ovarian cancers. In prostate cancer, E2F5 is significantly upregulated, particularly in tissues with a Gleason score of 6, suggesting its potential role as an oncogene and a marker for early prostate carcinogenesis (Majumder2016Deregulated). The overexpression of E2F5 is associated with increased phosphorylation of SMAD3 and p38, contributing to uncontrolled cellular proliferation through the TGFβ signaling pathway (Majumder2016Deregulated).

In breast cancer, E2F5 overexpression correlates with a worse clinical outcome and is associated with a pathological basal phenotype, particularly in ER-negative and HER2-negative subtypes (Umemura2009Overexpression). E2F5 is also implicated in ovarian cancer, where its expression is significantly higher in malignant tissues compared to normal or benign tissues. It serves as a potential diagnostic marker, especially in early-stage epithelial ovarian cancer, and its combination with CA125 improves diagnostic accuracy (Kothandaraman2010E2F5).

These findings underscore the clinical significance of E2F5 in cancer diagnosis and prognosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
E2F5, a member of the E2F family of transcription factors, participates in various protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. E2F5 interacts with pocket proteins such as p107 and p130, with a notable preference for p130 in vivo, which is crucial for its regulatory functions (Lindeman1998A). In the context of liver regeneration, E2F5 forms a complex with TFDP1 and BRG1, a chromatin remodeling protein, to mediate the transcriptional activation of the MYCN gene. This complex is essential for the upregulation of MYCN expression, highlighting E2F5's role in liver cell cycle progression (Fan2021An).

In prostate cancer, E2F5 is associated with the phosphorylation of SMAD3 and p38, indicating its involvement in the TGF-β signaling pathway. E2F5's interaction with these proteins suggests a role in promoting cell cycle progression and tumorigenic signaling (Majumder2016Deregulated). In zebrafish, E2F5 acts as a transcriptional activator, binding to the promoter of the dmc1 gene, which is crucial for spermatogenesis. This interaction underscores E2F5's role in regulating genes necessary for cellular differentiation processes (Xie2020E2f5).
