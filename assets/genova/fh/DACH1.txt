# DACH1

## Overview
DACH1 is a gene that encodes the dachshund family transcription factor 1, a protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell fate determination, tumor suppression, and transcriptional regulation. The DACH1 protein is characterized as a transcription factor, featuring a helix-turn-helix structure that facilitates its interaction with DNA and other proteins (Hassan2020Mechanistic). It contains conserved domains such as the dachshund domain 1 (DD1) and dachshund domain 2 (DD2), which are essential for its transcriptional activity and protein interactions (Ikeda2002Molecular). DACH1 is involved in multiple signaling pathways, including the TGF-β and Wnt pathways, and is implicated in the regulation of aldosterone secretion, cell cycle control, and bone metabolism (Sundaram2007DACH1; Wu2006DACH1; Zhou2015DACH1). Alterations in DACH1 expression or function are associated with various cancers and diseases, highlighting its significance in maintaining normal cellular functions and its potential as a therapeutic target (Pestell2023The; Xu2017DACH1).

## Structure
The DACH1 protein is a transcription factor involved in various cellular processes, including tumor suppression and cell fate determination. It is composed of 758 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 78 kDa (Hassan2020Mechanistic). The protein features a helix-turn-helix structure, also known as Box-N, which is crucial for its function in DNA binding and protein interactions (Hassan2020Mechanistic). 

DACH1 contains several conserved domains, including the dachshund domain 1 (DD1) and dachshund domain 2 (DD2), which are important for transcriptional activation and interaction with other proteins like Eyes absent (Eya) (Ikeda2002Molecular). The DS domain, another significant region, is involved in binding to proteins such as Ku70 and Ku80, which are essential for DNA repair processes (Pestell2023The).

Post-translational modifications of DACH1 include phosphorylation, acetylation, and SUMOylation, which influence its role in cellular processes and tumor suppression (Ma2023The; Hassan2020Mechanistic). Specific phosphorylation sites, such as Ser439, are targeted by kinases involved in DNA damage signaling (Pestell2023The). DACH1 also has multiple splice variant isoforms, which can affect its function and localization (Ma2023The).

## Function
The DACH1 gene encodes a transcription factor involved in cell fate determination and plays a significant role in regulating gene expression in human cells. In the adrenal gland, DACH1 is selectively expressed in the zona glomerulosa, where it suppresses aldosterone secretion by activating the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway and influencing the Wnt signaling pathway (Zhou2015DACH1). DACH1's nuclear localization is typical in human adrenals, and its expression is associated with the regulation of aldosterone production, which is crucial for maintaining electrolyte balance and blood pressure (Zhou2015DACH1).

In breast tissue, DACH1 functions as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cyclin D1, a key regulator of the cell cycle. It forms a repressor complex with HDAC1, mSin3A, and NCoR at the cyclin D1 promoter, thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis and tumor growth (Wu2006DACH1). DACH1 expression is reduced in breast cancer tissues, suggesting its role in maintaining normal cell function and preventing tumorigenesis (Wu2006DACH1).

In bone metabolism, DACH1 negatively regulates the expression of the receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) in stromal/preosteoblast cells, which is important for osteoclastogenesis. This regulation involves interaction with the nuclear co-repressor NCoR and is crucial for modulating bone remodeling processes (Sundaram2007DACH1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DACH1 gene are implicated in various cancers and diseases. In uterine cancer, particularly among Appalachian women, DACH1 mutations are associated with increased tumor mutation burden and altered chemotherapy sensitivity, notably affecting the FXR/RXR pathways and cell cycle control genes (Riggs2023Increased). In prostate cancer, DACH1 is frequently deleted, leading to increased androgen receptor activity and poor prognosis. This deletion is linked to enhanced prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and increased DNA damage, as DACH1 is involved in DNA repair processes (Pestell2023The).

In breast cancer, DACH1 acts as a tumor suppressor, with its reduced expression correlating with poor prognosis and increased cancer stem cell markers. It negatively regulates CD44, a marker associated with cancer progression and metastasis (Xu2017DACH1). DACH1 is also identified as a risk gene for kidney disease, contributing to fibrosis and increased susceptibility to kidney injury when its expression is low (Doke2021Transcriptomewide). In glioma, low DACH1 expression is linked to increased tumor malignancy, with its overexpression inhibiting tumor growth by affecting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Wang2018DACH).

## Interactions
DACH1 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation. It does not directly interact with Eya proteins but forms a complex with DNA-bound Eya through the mediation of CREB-binding protein (CBP). This interaction is crucial for the synergistic activation of transcription by Eya and DACH1, as demonstrated by the fact that E1A, which binds CBP, can abrogate this transactivation (Ikeda2002Molecular). DACH1 also binds to chromatin DNA independently, suggesting it can tether to the chromatin DNA template on its own (Ikeda2002Molecular).

DACH1 is involved in the repression of cyclin D1 expression by forming a multimeric repressor complex with HDAC1, mSin3A, and NCoR at the AP-1 site of the cyclin D1 promoter. This repression is dependent on the DS domain of DACH1, which is essential for its recruitment to the promoter through interactions with AP-1 proteins like c-Jun and CREB (Wu2006DACH1).

In stromal/preosteoblast cells, DACH1 interacts with heat shock factor-2 (HSF-2) to negatively regulate RANKL gene expression. This interaction is enhanced by FGF-2, which promotes the nuclear translocation of HSF-2, facilitating its binding to DACH1 (Sundaram2007DACH1).
