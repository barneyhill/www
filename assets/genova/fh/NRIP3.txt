# NRIP3

## Overview
NRIP3, or nuclear receptor interacting protein 3, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of cancer biology. The NRIP3 protein is known for its role in modulating interactions with other proteins, such as DDI1, and influencing pathways that contribute to cellular stress responses and therapy resistance. It is categorized as a nuclear receptor interacting protein, which suggests its involvement in transcriptional regulation and signal transduction pathways. NRIP3 has been implicated in the progression and treatment resistance of several cancers, including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and breast cancer, where it is associated with poor prognosis and altered expression patterns. Its expression and activity are subject to regulation by pathways such as PPARα and are influenced by epigenetic modifications, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Cizkova2010Gene; Zhong2006Pharmacologic; Suo2020NRIP3).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
NRIP3 upregulation has been linked to poor prognosis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy (CRT). It is associated with reduced overall survival and increased resistance to CRT. This resistance is facilitated by NRIP3's role in the ubiquitination and degradation of RTF2, which is crucial for replication fork recovery during DNA damage. NRIP3 interacts with DDI1, a proteasomal shuttle protein, and modulates PPARα, a nuclear receptor involved in fatty acid metabolism. These interactions contribute to decreased ceramide levels, which are important for cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, thereby promoting tumor progression and CRT resistance in ESCC (Suo2020NRIP3).

In breast cancer, NRIP3 is overexpressed in PIK3CA-mutated tumors, suggesting a role in the molecular pathology of these cancers. It is part of a gene set that can classify tumors based on PIK3CA mutation status, indicating its potential clinical relevance in distinguishing between different mutation statuses (Cizkova2010Gene).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), NRIP3 is subject to epigenetic regulation, including DNA methylation and histone deacetylation. Its methylation status is linked to its expression levels, and it may be targeted for silencing in various tumor types (Zhong2006Pharmacologic).

## Interactions
NRIP3 (nuclear receptor interacting protein 3) is involved in several protein interactions that play a crucial role in cellular processes. In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), NRIP3 interacts with DDI1, a proteasomal shuttle protein, to facilitate the removal of RTF2 during replication stress. This interaction accelerates the ubiquitination and degradation of RTF2, contributing to chemoradiotherapy resistance in ESCC (Suo2020NRIP3). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have confirmed the interaction between NRIP3 and DDI1, as well as NRIP3's ability to bind RTF2, leading to its rapid degradation in cells overexpressing NRIP3 (Suo2020NRIP3).

NRIP3 also influences the expression of DDI1 through the PPARα pathway, as evidenced by changes in DDI1 levels upon treatment with PPARα antagonists and agonists (Suo2020NRIP3). This interaction is significant for restarting replication forks and reducing DNA damage, thereby enhancing resistance to chemoradiotherapy (Suo2020NRIP3). These interactions highlight NRIP3's role in modulating protein interactions and pathways that contribute to cancer cell survival and therapy resistance.
