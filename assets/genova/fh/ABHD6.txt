# ABHD6

## Overview
ABHD6, or abhydrolase domain containing 6, is a gene that encodes the protein acylglycerol lipase, a member of the α/β-hydrolase family. This protein is characterized by its enzymatic activity in lipid metabolism, particularly in the hydrolysis of monoacylglycerols, including the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) (Zhang2021AlphaBetaHydrolase; Pusch2022αβHydrolase). ABHD6 is ubiquitously expressed across various human tissues, with notable expression in the brain, brown adipose tissue, and intestine, reflecting its diverse physiological roles (Pusch2022αβHydrolase). Functionally, ABHD6 is involved in modulating synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission in the central nervous system, as well as influencing metabolic processes such as insulin secretion in pancreatic β cells (Wei2016αβHydrolase; Pusch2022αβHydrolase). Clinically, alterations in ABHD6 expression or function have been associated with metabolic disorders, cancer, and inflammatory diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Poursharifi2017Monoacylglycerol; Tang2020Enhanced; Zhao2016αβHydrolase).

## Structure
The ABHD6 protein is a member of the α/β-hydrolase family, characterized by a canonical α/β-hydrolase fold. This fold includes a core domain with an 8-stranded β-sheet surrounded by α-helices, and a lid formed by α-helical structures (Pusch2022αβHydrolase; Kind2018Structural). The primary structure of ABHD6 features key motifs such as the acyltransferase motif HXXXXD on the β5-strand and the nucleophile motif GXSXG, which includes a catalytic serine (Ser148) (Kind2018Structural). The catalytic triad of ABHD6 consists of Ser148, Asp278, and His306, essential for its enzymatic activity (Pusch2022αβHydrolase; Kind2018Structural).

The tertiary structure of ABHD6 includes a tunnel approximately 23 Å long, lined by hydrophobic residues near the active site, facilitating substrate interaction (Pusch2022αβHydrolase). The protein is predicted to have a transmembrane domain at the N-terminal end, suggesting membrane integration and interaction with lipid substrates (Pusch2022αβHydrolase; Kind2018Structural). The quaternary structure is not explicitly detailed, but the presence of two molecules in the asymmetric unit suggests potential dimerization (Pusch2022αβHydrolase). ABHD6 is also subject to post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and exists in several isoforms due to alternative splicing (NaviaPaldanius2012Biochemical).

## Function
ABHD6 is a multifunctional lipid hydrolase involved in various molecular processes, primarily in lipid metabolism. It hydrolyzes monoacylglycerols (MAGs), including 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), a significant endocannabinoid, thus playing a crucial role in regulating endocannabinoid signaling pathways (Zhang2021AlphaBetaHydrolase; Pusch2022αβHydrolase). ABHD6 is expressed ubiquitously in human tissues, with the highest levels in the brain, brown adipose tissue, and intestine, indicating its involvement in diverse physiological functions (Pusch2022αβHydrolase).

In the central nervous system, ABHD6 is part of AMPA receptor complexes, where it negatively regulates the surface delivery and synaptic function of these receptors, independent of its enzymatic activity (Zhang2021AlphaBetaHydrolase; Wei2016αβHydrolase). This regulation affects synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission, highlighting its role in modulating synaptic strength and plasticity (Wei2016αβHydrolase).

ABHD6 also influences metabolic processes, such as glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in pancreatic β cells, where it acts as a major MAG hydrolase. Inhibition of ABHD6 leads to increased MAG levels and enhanced insulin secretion, suggesting its role in energy homeostasis and metabolic regulation (Pusch2022αβHydrolase).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the ABHD6 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In the context of metabolic disorders, ABHD6 plays a significant role in energy homeostasis and lipid metabolism. Suppression of ABHD6 has been shown to protect against obesity and type 2 diabetes by promoting adipose browning and enhancing energy expenditure, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for these conditions (Zhao2016αβHydrolase). 

In cancer, particularly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ABHD6 is identified as a primary monoacylglycerol lipase that promotes tumor growth and metastasis. High levels of ABHD6 are associated with poorer prognosis in NSCLC patients. Inhibition of ABHD6 reduces tumor cell invasion and migration, indicating its role as a pro-oncogenic factor (Tang2020Enhanced).

ABHD6 is also implicated in inflammatory processes and autoimmune disorders. Its inhibition in macrophages can lead to anti-inflammatory effects, and a single nucleotide polymorphism in the ABHD6 gene has been associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), suggesting a role in regulating inflammatory pathways (Poursharifi2017Monoacylglycerol).

## Interactions
ABHD6 interacts with several proteins, influencing synaptic function and energy metabolism. It is known to bind directly to the C-terminal domains of AMPA receptor (AMPAR) subunits GluA1, GluA2, and GluA3. This interaction is independent of ABHD6's enzymatic activity and negatively regulates the surface delivery of AMPARs, thereby affecting synaptic transmission (Wei2017The; Wei2016αβHydrolase). The specific sequence GFCLIPQ in the C-terminus of GluA1 is essential for this interaction (Wei2016αβHydrolase).

ABHD6 also interacts with carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1c (CPT1c), a protein involved in energy metabolism. This interaction affects ABHD6's enzymatic activity and is modulated by the presence of malonyl-CoA. However, the interaction does not depend on malonyl-CoA levels or the C-terminal region of CPT1c (Zhang2021AlphaBetaHydrolase; Miralpeix2021Carnitine).

In pancreatic β cells, ABHD6 is part of a multiprotein complex associated with AMPA receptors and plays a role in regulating insulin secretion by modulating cellular MAG levels (Pusch2022αβHydrolase). These interactions highlight ABHD6's involvement in both synaptic function and metabolic regulation.
