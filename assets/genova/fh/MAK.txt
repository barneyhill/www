# MAK

## Overview
The MAK gene encodes the male germ cell-associated kinase, a serine/threonine protein kinase predominantly expressed in testicular germ cells and the retina. This kinase is integral to the regulation of ciliary length and function, particularly in retinal photoreceptor cells and respiratory epithelia, where it ensures proper ciliary subcompartmentalization and photoreceptor survival (Özgül2011Exome; Omori2010Negative). The MAK protein is characterized by a conserved kinase domain homologous to the cdc2-CDC28 gene family, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (Matsushime1990A). It interacts with various proteins, such as synaptopodin and Nedd4, influencing cytoskeletal regulation and developmental signaling (Kalinichenko2012Identification; Kalinichenko2011Interaction). The absence or dysfunction of MAK can lead to elongated cilia and photoreceptor degeneration, underscoring its critical role in cellular processes and potential implications in disease (Omori2010Negative).

## Structure
The MAK gene encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase that is primarily expressed in testicular germ cells. The predicted protein product of the MAK gene consists of 622 amino acids in rats and 623 amino acids in humans, indicating a high degree of conservation across species (Matsushime1990A; Jinno1993TestisSpecific). The primary structure of the MAK protein includes a kinase domain, which is essential for its enzymatic activity, and is homologous to the cdc2-CDC28 gene family, sharing approximately 40% identity in the kinase domain (Matsushime1990A). This domain contains protein kinase consensus motifs, such as a lysine residue for ATP binding and a Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Gly stretch (Matsushime1990A).

The MAK protein also features a proline- and glutamine-rich region and a carboxy-terminal domain, which may influence its kinase activity or cellular localization (Matsushime1990A). The protein is associated with a 210-kDa cellular phosphoprotein, which it phosphorylates on serine and threonine residues, indicating its role in spermatogenesis (Jinno1993TestisSpecific). The MAK protein exists in multiple isoforms, with the 66- and 60-kDa forms identified in rats (Jinno1993TestisSpecific). These isoforms may result from alternative splicing, which can lead to variations in function and localization.

## Function
The MAK gene encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase that plays a critical role in regulating ciliary length, which is essential for the proper function of cilia in cells. In healthy human cells, MAK is predominantly expressed in the retina and testis, with its kinase activity being crucial for maintaining normal ciliary length and function (Özgül2011Exome). The protein is localized in the connecting cilia and outer-segment axonemes of retinal photoreceptor cells, where it is involved in the regulation of ciliary length and subcompartmentalization (Omori2010Negative).

MAK's kinase activity is essential for its function, as it phosphorylates specific proteins, such as the N-terminal portion of retinitis pigmentosa 1 (RP1), which is involved in ciliary length regulation (Omori2010Negative). The absence of MAK leads to elongated cilia and photoreceptor degeneration, highlighting its role in photoreceptor survival and function (Omori2010Negative). In addition to its role in the retina, MAK is also expressed in the cilia of respiratory epithelia, indicating its broader role in ciliary function beyond the retina (Omori2010Negative).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
The MAK (male germ cell associated kinase) protein is involved in several interactions with other proteins, influencing various cellular processes. MAK interacts with synaptopodin, a protein that plays a role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. This interaction was confirmed through various methods, including yeast two-hybrid systems, Western blotting, and immunocytochemistry assays, indicating a specific interaction with the C-terminal domain of MAK (Kalinichenko2011Interaction).

MAK also interacts with the Nedd4 E3 ubiquitin ligase, although this interaction does not involve the typical ubiquitin-proteasome system. Instead, Nedd4 affects MAK's functions independently of its ubiquitin ligase activity. In Xenopus embryos, Nedd4 can rescue developmental defects caused by MAK overexpression, suggesting a regulatory role that does not rely on ubiquitination (Kalinichenko2012Identification). The interaction between MAK and Nedd4 involves the N-terminal region of MAK, which includes its catalytic and SNH/UBA domains (Kalinichenko2012Identification).

These interactions highlight MAK's involvement in cellular processes such as cytoskeletal regulation and developmental signaling, potentially impacting tumorigenesis and other pathways.
