# PPP2R5A

## Overview
The PPP2R5A gene encodes the protein phosphatase 2 regulatory subunit B'alpha, also known as B56α, which is a critical component of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complex. PP2A is a major serine/threonine phosphatase involved in the regulation of various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, signal transduction, and apoptosis. The B56α subunit, encoded by PPP2R5A, plays a pivotal role in determining the substrate specificity of PP2A, thereby influencing its regulatory functions. This protein is categorized as a regulatory subunit and is involved in modulating the activity of PP2A through interactions with various kinases and other proteins. The PPP2R5A gene is located on chromosome 1q32.2-q32.3 and is expressed in multiple isoforms, contributing to its diverse functional roles in cellular homeostasis and disease states, such as cancer and cardiac disorders (Mao2018PPP2R5A:; Verbinnen2021Protein; Pluteanu2024Loss).

## Structure
PPP2R5A, also known as B56α, is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a major serine/threonine phosphatase in cells. The protein is encoded by the PPP2R5A gene located on chromosome 1q32.2-q32.3 and exists in two isoforms, PPP2R5A1 and PPP2R5A2 (Mao2018PPP2R5A:). Structurally, PPP2R5A features eight two-helix units that form a solenoid-shaped structure, resembling huntingtin-elongation-A subunits-TOR-like (HEAT) repeats. These pseudo-HEAT repeats are crucial for the protein's function, as the concave side is unoccupied and situated near the active site on the C subunit, which is believed to recruit substrates and provide substrate specificity for PP2A (Mao2018PPP2R5A:).

PPP2R5A is a phosphoprotein, meaning it undergoes reversible phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, which regulates its activity. Various kinases, including cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), protein kinase C alpha (PKCα), and protein RNA-dependent kinase (PKR), can phosphorylate PPP2R5A, influencing its regulatory function on PP2A (Mao2018PPP2R5A:). This post-translational modification affects processes such as cell proliferation, protein synthesis, and apoptosis, highlighting its role in cellular regulation and cancer suppression (Mao2018PPP2R5A:).

## Function
PPP2R5A encodes the B56α regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a serine/threonine phosphatase involved in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, PPP2R5A plays a crucial role in modulating PP2A activity, which is essential for cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, and apoptosis. The B56α subunit influences the substrate specificity of PP2A, thereby affecting the dephosphorylation of key proteins involved in these processes (Verbinnen2021Protein).

PPP2R5A is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, impacting cellular growth and differentiation. It is involved in the regulation of calcium homeostasis and heart contractility by dephosphorylating regulatory proteins, which is critical for maintaining cardiac rhythm stability, particularly under stress conditions (Pluteanu2024Loss). The protein also plays a role in the dephosphorylation of the ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2), which is crucial for regulating calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in cardiomyocytes (Pluteanu2024Loss).

In the context of cancer, PPP2R5A is involved in the regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway, acting as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating β-catenin and GSK3β, which are key components of this pathway (Zhuang2017MicroRNA218).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PPP2R5A gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cardiac and cancer-related conditions. In cardiac health, the loss of the PPP2R5A gene, which encodes the regulatory subunit B56α of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), is associated with increased susceptibility to stress-induced proarrhythmias. This is characterized by prolonged QT intervals, increased premature ventricular contractions, and episodes of ventricular tachyarrhythmia, especially under catecholaminergic stress. The dysfunction is linked to hyperphosphorylation of the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2), leading to increased calcium spark frequency and arrhythmogenic activity (Pluteanu2024Loss).

In cancer, PPP2R5A acts as a tumor suppressor, and its dysregulation is associated with various malignancies, including endometrial carcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, and prostate cancer. Abnormal expression or mutations in PPP2R5A can disrupt its interactions with PP2A, affecting pathways like Wnt and JAK/STAT, which are crucial in cancer development. For instance, miR-218 downregulates PPP2R5A, promoting cisplatin resistance in oral cancer by activating the Wnt signaling pathway (Zhuang2017MicroRNA218; Mao2018PPP2R5A).

## Interactions
PPP2R5A, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), participates in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with CDK and CHK proteins to promote mitosis by ensuring stable kinetochore-microtubule attachments and correct chromosome separation (Mao2018PPP2R5A:). PPP2R5A also associates with Axin in degradation complexes for oncogenic proteins like β-Catenin and c-Myc, thereby suppressing the Wnt signaling pathway and reducing c-Myc stability (Mao2018PPP2R5A:). 

In the context of cancer pathways, PPP2R5A interacts with the cancerous inhibitor of PP2A (CIP2A), which is overexpressed in many tumors. CIP2A binds to PPP2R5A, maintaining its stability and disrupting PP2A's function by interfering with its substrate and subunit interactions (Mao2018PPP2R5A:). PPP2R5A is also involved in the regulation of p53 by dephosphorylating MDM2/HDM2, which affects p53 degradation (Mao2018PPP2R5A:).

Additionally, PPP2R5A is targeted by the HIV-1 Vif protein, which mediates its degradation. This interaction is significant as it suggests a role for PPP2R5A in viral pathogenesis, with Vif binding to PPP2R5A to promote its degradation, thereby affecting the cellular phospho-proteome (Salamango2020Functional).
