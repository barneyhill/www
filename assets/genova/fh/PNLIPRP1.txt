# PNLIPRP1

## Overview
PNLIPRP1, or pancreatic lipase related protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in lipid metabolism and cellular regulation within the pancreas. Although the protein lacks defined lipase activity, it plays a crucial role in regulating cholesterol homeostasis and interacting with other proteins such as carboxyl ester lipase (CEL) to inhibit dietary triglyceride digestion. PNLIPRP1 is primarily expressed in pancreatic acinar cells and is implicated in maintaining cellular identity and normal pancreatic function. The gene's expression is influenced by epigenetic modifications, which have been linked to metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes and pancreatic cancer. PNLIPRP1 is also involved in cell cycle regulation, highlighting its importance in preventing pathological conditions through its role in lipid metabolism and cellular processes (Maurin2022Epigenetics; Sneha2018Probing).

## Function
PNLIPRP1 (pancreatic lipase related protein 1) is primarily expressed in the acinar cells of the pancreas, where it plays a role in lipid metabolism and maintaining cellular identity. Although PNLIPRP1 lacks defined lipase activity, it is involved in the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis, as evidenced by its association with LDL cholesterol levels (Maurin2022Epigenetics). The gene's expression is inversely correlated with hypermethylation at a specific CpG site, which is linked to type 2 diabetes (T2D) status. In healthy human cells, PNLIPRP1 is expressed in the pancreas and may contribute to the hydrolysis of fat molecules, although its specific enzymatic function remains unclear (Marchegiani2015The).

PNLIPRP1 is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, as its knockdown in cell models leads to decreased expression of genes involved in ATM signaling, which is crucial for cell cycle checkpoints (Maurin2022Epigenetics). This regulation is important for maintaining normal cell proliferation and preventing dysregulation that could lead to diseases such as pancreatic cancer. The gene's role in lipid metabolism and cell cycle regulation suggests its importance in maintaining normal pancreatic function and preventing pathological conditions.

## Clinical Significance
The PNLIPRP1 gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions, primarily through its altered expression and epigenetic modifications. In the context of type 2 diabetes (T2D), hypermethylation in the enhancer region of PNLIPRP1 is strongly associated with the disease and inversely correlated with its expression. This downregulation is linked to metabolic abnormalities and changes in cell fate, such as acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM), which can progress to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) (Maurin2022Epigenetics). 

PNLIPRP1 is also noted for its role in lipid metabolism, with its variants associated with increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, although not directly with T2D or obesity (Maurin2022Epigenetics). In pancreatic cancer, PNLIPRP1 is identified as a tumor suppressor gene, with its downregulation linked to the inhibition of proliferation in pancreatic cancer cells (Zhou2019Integrated; Goonesekere2017Identification). 

Furthermore, PNLIPRP1 expression is downregulated in solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN) of the pancreas, indicating altered exocrine differentiation (Cavard2009Gene). These findings suggest that PNLIPRP1 plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of metabolic and pancreatic diseases.

## Interactions
PNLIPRP1, or pancreatic lipase-related protein 1, is known to interact with the carboxyl ester lipase (CEL) protein. CEL is a significant component of pancreatic juice and is involved in the hydrolysis of various lipid substrates. The interaction between PNLIPRP1 and CEL is particularly noteworthy because PNLIPRP1 acts as an inhibitor of dietary triglyceride digestion, despite lacking detectable lipase activity itself. This interaction is crucial for understanding the metabolic pathways and potential dysfunctions that can lead to conditions such as MODY8, a form of diabetes characterized by pancreatic exocrine and endocrine dysfunctions (Sneha2018Probing).

PNLIPRP1 is also highlighted in the context of glycemic control after bariatric surgery. It is a significant target in the pancreatic secretion pathway, which is emphasized for its therapeutic role in the surgical process, possibly through the entero-pancreatic axis. The long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) NONMMUG021726 targets PNLIPRP1, indicating a high degree of interaction within the lncRNA-target gene interaction network. This suggests that PNLIPRP1 may play a role in the regulation of glycemic control through its interactions with lncRNAs (Liang2017Duodenal).
