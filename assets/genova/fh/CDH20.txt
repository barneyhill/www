# CDH20

## Overview
CDH20 is a gene that encodes the protein cadherin 20, a member of the cadherin superfamily, which is integral to calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion processes. Cadherin 20 is classified as a type-II cadherin, characterized by its unique structural features, including multiple extracellular cadherin (EC) repeats and two conserved tryptophan residues within its hydrophobic core (Hulpiau2009Molecular). This transmembrane protein is primarily involved in maintaining tissue integrity and facilitating cellular interactions, playing a significant role in tissue morphogenesis and synaptic formation, particularly within the nervous system (Pal2018Cadherin; Takahashi2008Expression). The gene's expression and function are crucial in various tissues, including epithelial cells, the brain, and neuroendocrine organs, and its dysregulation has been implicated in pathological conditions such as cancer, where it acts as a tumor suppressor-like molecule (Li2020The; Pal2018Cadherin).

## Structure
CDH20, also known as cadherin 20, is a type-II cadherin characterized by its molecular structure, which includes multiple extracellular cadherin (EC) repeats. The protein features two conserved tryptophan residues, Trp2 and Trp4, anchored into a large hydrophobic core, a hallmark of type-II cadherins (Hulpiau2009Molecular). This structural feature distinguishes it from type-I cadherins, which typically accommodate only one tryptophan residue in their hydrophobic pocket.

CDH20 is part of a minicluster on human chromosome 18q22-q23, indicating its genomic organization, though specific details on its primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures are not provided in the available literature (Angst2001The). The protein's ectodomain is encoded by a long exon, while it has a short cytoplasmic domain of only 40 amino acids, which was not included in motif analysis due to its length (Hulpiau2009Molecular).

The structural diversity within the cadherin superfamily, including CDH20, contributes to their varied functions in cell-cell adhesion and signaling, although specific post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms for CDH20 are not detailed in the sources (Sotomayor2014Sorting).

## Function
CDH20, a member of the cadherin superfamily, plays a crucial role in calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion, which is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of tissues. This protein is primarily active at the cell membrane, where it facilitates homophilic interactions between cells, contributing to the organization and function of tissues (Angst2001The; Pal2018Cadherin). CDH20 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell growth, invasion suppression, and tissue morphogenesis. It acts as a ligand for adhesion molecules such as integrin alpha-E/beta-7, and is expressed in epithelial cells, the brain, kidney, prostate, fetal lung, and neuroendocrine organs (Pal2018Cadherin).

In the nervous system, CDH20 is implicated in synaptic formation and morphogenesis, contributing to processes like axon outgrowth and guidance, as well as cell sorting and adhesion (Takahashi2008Expression). The protein's expression pattern suggests its involvement in the development and maintenance of these tissues, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular and tissue function (Pal2018Cadherin). Dysregulation of CDH20 could potentially contribute to pathological conditions, underscoring its role as a tumor suppressor-like molecule (Pal2018Cadherin).

## Clinical Significance
CDH20 has been identified as a tumor suppressor gene in cervical cancer, where its expression is notably downregulated in both localized and metastatic tumors. This downregulation is associated with poor overall survival and disease-free survival rates, as well as with higher histologic grade, FIGO stage, and lymph node metastasis (Li2020The). The gene's interaction with β-catenin is crucial in inhibiting cervical cancer cell migration and invasion. CDH20 suppresses TGF-β-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by downregulating Snail through reducing the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad2/3, thereby enhancing cell adhesion and inhibiting cancer cell migration and invasion (Li2020The).

Mutations in CDH20 have also been identified in other cancers, such as esophageal adenocarcinoma, colorectal cancer, and breast cancer, suggesting a broader role in cancer metastasis (Li2020The). The gene's interaction with β-catenin appears to negatively regulate the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, which is significant in cancer progression (Li2020The). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of CDH20 in cancer diagnosis and treatment.

## Interactions
CDH20 interacts with β-catenin, a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway, and this interaction plays a significant role in cervical cancer cell behavior. Overexpression of CDH20 in cervical cancer cells leads to increased cell adhesion and reduced migration and invasion, suggesting an inhibitory role in these processes. CDH20 promotes the accumulation of β-catenin at the cell membrane, which is typically part of adherens junctions, while reducing its presence in the nucleus. This suggests that CDH20 acts as a negative regulator of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (Li2020The).

The interaction between CDH20 and β-catenin is crucial for modulating the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. CDH20 overexpression results in increased levels of E-cadherin and β-catenin, while reducing N-cadherin and vimentin, indicating its role in inhibiting EMT. This interaction is part of a mechanism involving the TGF-β/Smad2/3/Snail signaling pathway, where CDH20 reduces the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad2/3, downregulating Snail and upregulating E-cadherin, thereby suppressing TGF-β-induced EMT (Li2020The). Co-immunoprecipitation assays confirm the physical interaction between CDH20 and β-catenin, which is essential for inhibiting cervical cancer cell migration and invasion (Li2020The).
