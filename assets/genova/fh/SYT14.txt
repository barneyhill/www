# SYT14

## Overview
SYT14 is a gene that encodes the protein synaptotagmin 14, a member of the synaptotagmin family, which is primarily involved in membrane trafficking and exocytosis processes within the central nervous system. Unlike other synaptotagmins, synaptotagmin 14 is characterized by its calcium-independent function due to the absence of canonical aspartate residues necessary for calcium binding (Sudhof2011Calcium). This protein is predominantly expressed in the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, indicating its significant role in cerebellar function and neural signaling (Doi2011Exome). Synaptotagmin 14 is localized to perinuclear and submembranous regions, suggesting its involvement in intracellular trafficking and membrane dynamics (Doi2011Exome). The gene has been associated with various neurological conditions, including spinocerebellar ataxia and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, highlighting its clinical significance (Doi2011Exome; Stefani2020Neurophysiological).

## Function
SYT14 (synaptotagmin 14) is a member of the synaptotagmin family, which is involved in membrane trafficking and exocytosis processes, particularly in the central nervous system. It is expressed in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum in both humans and mice, suggesting a significant role in cerebellar function and neural signaling (Doi2011Exome). Unlike other synaptotagmins, SYT14 is calcium-independent, lacking the canonical aspartate residues required for calcium binding, which differentiates its function from other family members that act as calcium sensors (Sudhof2011Calcium).

In healthy cells, SYT14 is localized to perinuclear and submembranous regions, indicating its involvement in intracellular trafficking and membrane dynamics (Doi2011Exome). The protein's role in synaptic vesicle exocytosis is crucial for neurotransmitter release, impacting synaptic transmission and overall brain function (Craxton2004Synaptotagmin). Although its precise molecular activities in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, its expression in the central nervous system and involvement in vesicle exocytosis suggest a role in maintaining normal neural communication and cerebellar function (Doi2011Exome).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SYT14 gene have been linked to adult-onset, autosomal-recessive spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) with psychomotor retardation. A specific homozygous mutation, p.Gly484Asp, has been identified in affected individuals, leading to symptoms such as cerebellar degeneration, mild to moderate mental retardation, and cerebellar atrophy (Doi2011Exome). This mutation results in abnormal protein localization and retention in the endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting improper protein folding, which may contribute to the disease pathology (Doi2011Exome).

The SYT14 gene is also implicated in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), where an inframe deletion, p.Glu270del, has been associated with cerebral atrophy, macrocephaly, seizures, developmental delay, and spinocerebellar ataxia with psychomotor retardation (Stefani2020Neurophysiological). However, the presence of this variant was not statistically significant among JME patients, indicating a complex genetic background for the condition (Stefani2020Neurophysiological).

In glioma, SYT14 expression is crucial for cell proliferation and survival. Knockdown of SYT14 in glioma cell lines results in decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis, suggesting its potential role in glioma pathogenesis (Sheng2018RNAimediated).
