# SLC5A7

## Overview
The SLC5A7 gene encodes the protein known as solute carrier family 5 member 7 (CHT1), which is a sodium-dependent high-affinity choline transporter. This transmembrane protein is integral to the uptake of choline in cholinergic neurons, a process essential for the synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) (Rodríguez2021Presynaptic; Banerjee2019The). CHT1 is characterized by its 13 transmembrane domains and functions as a homo-oligomer, facilitating the transport of choline across cell membranes (Banerjee2019The). The protein's activity is crucial for maintaining normal neuromuscular function and is regulated by various post-translational modifications and interactions with other proteins (Ribeiro2003The; Banerjee2019The). Mutations in the SLC5A7 gene have been linked to several neuromuscular and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its significance in human health (Tian2024Genetic; Pugliese2023Presynaptic).

## Structure
The SLC5A7 gene encodes the sodium-dependent high-affinity choline transporter 1 (CHT1), a protein crucial for choline uptake in cholinergic neurons. The CHT1 protein is composed of 580 amino acids and is organized into 13 transmembrane domains, which facilitate its function as a transporter across cell membranes (Rodríguez2021Presynaptic; Banerjee2019The). The protein has an extracellular amino-terminus and a cytosolic carboxy-terminus, with its structure predicted to form dimers or oligomers on the cell surface (Banerjee2019The). 

Although no crystal structure has been solved for CHT1, it is thought to form a homo-oligomer, indicating a quaternary structure (Rodríguez2021Presynaptic). The protein's function is regulated by post-translational modifications, such as N-glycosylation, which affects its abundance and transport activity (Banerjee2019The). The SLC5A7 gene's exon organization is distinct, containing only 8 exons compared to the typical 14-15 exons found in other SLC5 family members (Wright2013Glucose). The protein's transport activity is Cl--dependent and regulated by extracellular pH, with its activity being the rate-limiting step in acetylcholine synthesis (Gyimesi2020Sodium-coupled).

## Function
The SLC5A7 gene encodes the high-affinity choline transporter 1 (CHT1), which is essential for the uptake of choline into presynaptic nerve terminals. This process is crucial for the synthesis of acetylcholine (ACh), a neurotransmitter vital for neuromuscular transmission and muscle contraction (Ohno2023Clinical; Rodríguez2021Presynaptic). CHT1 is a sodium-dependent transporter that operates via a sodium gradient, facilitating the reuptake of choline from the synaptic cleft after acetylcholine is broken down by acetylcholinesterase (Tian2024Genetic; Muntadas2024Congenital).

In healthy human cells, CHT1 is predominantly localized in intracellular vesicles at the neuromuscular junction, with a significant portion residing in early and recycling endosomes (Banerjee2019The). The transporter is a multi-pass protein composed of 580 amino acids, predicted to organize into 13 transmembrane domains, and functions as a homo-oligomer on the cell surface (Rodríguez2021Presynaptic; Banerjee2019The). The proper functioning of CHT1 is critical for maintaining normal neuromuscular function, as it ensures a continuous supply of choline for ACh synthesis, supporting muscle contraction and other cholinergic functions (Ohno2023Clinical; Tian2024Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC5A7 gene, which encodes the high-affinity choline transporter (CHT), are associated with several neuromuscular and neurodevelopmental disorders. One of the primary conditions linked to SLC5A7 mutations is presynaptic congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS), a disorder characterized by muscle weakness, hypotonia, episodic apneas, and developmental delays. This condition is typically inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and can present at birth (Rodríguez2021Presynaptic; Pugliese2023Presynaptic). 

Specific mutations, such as the p.Ser263Phe variant, have been associated with a lethal form of fetal akinesia syndrome, which includes symptoms like reduced prenatal movements, arthrogryposis, and severe hypotonia (Banerjee2019The). Additionally, SLC5A7 mutations can lead to autosomal dominant distal hereditary motor neuronopathy type VIIA (dHMN VIIa), characterized by progressive muscle weakness and atrophy, often with vocal cord paralysis (Tian2024Genetic; Rodríguez2021Presynaptic).

Alterations in SLC5A7 expression or function can also impact cognitive and behavioral functions, potentially contributing to mood disorders and attentional deficits due to impaired cholinergic signaling in the central nervous system (Pugliese2023Presynaptic). These findings underscore the gene's critical role in neuromuscular and neurodevelopmental health.

## Interactions
The SLC5A7 gene encodes the high-affinity choline transporter (CHT), which is involved in several protein-protein interactions that regulate its function and localization. CHT interacts with proteins involved in endocytosis and vesicular transport, such as clathrin, which mediates its internalization from the plasma membrane. This interaction is crucial for the dynamic cycling of CHT between the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments, affecting choline uptake during nerve activity (Ribeiro2003The).

CHT is also associated with cholesterol-rich lipid rafts in cell membranes, which are specialized membrane domains that facilitate interactions with other proteins. This association is important for the regulation of CHT activity and trafficking (Cuddy2013Regulation).

Additionally, CHT interacts with amyloid precursor protein (APP) family members, which can influence CHT protein levels and choline uptake activity. This interaction suggests a role for CHT in the context of neurodegenerative conditions, as APP is implicated in Alzheimer's disease (A.G.2012Choline).

These interactions highlight the complex regulatory network involving CHT and its binding partners, which are essential for maintaining cholinergic neurotransmission and may have implications for neurological disorders.
