# FAM171B

## Overview
FAM171B is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 171 member B. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of cancer biology. FAM171B is known for its role in stabilizing vimentin, a key protein involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is crucial for cancer metastasis. The protein encoded by FAM171B also interacts with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (HNRNPU), influencing mRNA splicing and contributing to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. These interactions underscore the gene's significance in promoting bladder cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target. Additionally, FAM171B has been associated with other pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases and pulmonary arterial hypertension, although its specific roles in these contexts remain to be fully elucidated (Hu2023FAM171B).

## Clinical Significance
FAM171B has been implicated in the progression of bladder cancer. Its overexpression is associated with poor survival outcomes and advanced clinicopathological stages in bladder cancer patients. FAM171B promotes cancer growth and metastasis by stabilizing vimentin, a protein linked to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and enhancing the splicing of CCL2 mRNA. This leads to increased recruitment and M2 polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), contributing to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which poses a challenge to effective immunotherapy (Hu2023FAM171B).

FAM171B expression is positively correlated with tumor progression and M2 TAM infiltration, while negatively correlated with CD8+ T cell infiltration in bladder cancer. This expression pattern is linked to reduced sensitivity to certain chemotherapeutic drugs, suggesting FAM171B as a potential prognostic indicator (Hu2023FAM171B). The gene's role in stabilizing vimentin involves reducing its ubiquitination, thereby enhancing cancer cell migration and invasion (Hu2023FAM171B).

Beyond bladder cancer, FAM171B has been noted in other conditions, such as neurodegenerative diseases and pulmonary arterial hypertension, though specific roles in these conditions are not detailed (Hu2023FAM171B).

## Interactions
FAM171B is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in bladder cancer progression. It interacts with vimentin, a protein associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), by stabilizing it and reducing its ubiquitination. This interaction is crucial for cancer cell adhesion, invasion, and survival, contributing to metastasis. The stabilization of vimentin by FAM171B occurs through post-translational mechanisms, as evidenced by a reduction in vimentin ubiquitination and an extended half-life of the vimentin protein in FAM171B-overexpressing cells (Hu2023FAM171B).

FAM171B also interacts with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (HNRNPU), which influences the splicing of CCL2 mRNA. This interaction enhances the recruitment and M2 polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), contributing to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The FAM171B-HNRNPU complex is predominantly localized in the nucleus, while the FAM171B-vimentin complex is primarily in the cytoplasm (Hu2023FAM171B).

These interactions highlight the role of FAM171B in promoting bladder cancer progression through its effects on protein stability and immune cell infiltration, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target (Hu2023FAM171B).
