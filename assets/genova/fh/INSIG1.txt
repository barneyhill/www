# INSIG1

## Overview
The INSIG1 gene encodes the insulin-induced gene 1 protein, a critical component in the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis and lipid metabolism. This protein is a polytopic transmembrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is involved in the regulation of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), which are transcription factors that activate genes responsible for cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis. INSIG1 functions by binding to the SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) in a sterol-dependent manner, thereby retaining the SCAP-SREBP complex in the ER and preventing the activation of genes involved in lipid biosynthesis. Additionally, INSIG1 plays a role in the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), the enzyme responsible for the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis. Through these mechanisms, INSIG1 helps maintain lipid balance and energy homeostasis, making it a significant target for understanding and potentially treating metabolic disorders such as diabetic dyslipidemia, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and obesity (Gong2006Juxtamembranous; Ouyang2020Emerging; Roth2008Regulatory).

## Structure
The INSIG1 protein is a six-span transmembrane polypeptide chain consisting of 277 amino acid residues, with a molecular weight of 29.55 kDa. It is embedded in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and features six transmembrane helices. The third and fourth helices are crucial for binding to the hydroxysterol/SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) complex (Ouyang2020Emerging). These helices are connected by five hydrophilic rings, with two rings free in the cytoplasm and three in the ER lumen (Ouyang2020Emerging).

A specific aspartic acid residue, Asp-205, is part of a conserved tetrapeptide sequence, DRSR, which is essential for the protein's function in cholesterol homeostasis. Mutations in this residue impair the ability of INSIG1 to bind to SCAP and inhibit SREBP-2 cleavage (Gong2006Juxtamembranous). The protein's structure includes hydrophilic N-terminal and C-terminal regions that extend into the cytoplasm (Ouyang2020Emerging). While the context does not provide detailed information on the tertiary or quaternary structures, it suggests that further structural studies could provide more insights into the functional role of specific residues (Gong2006Juxtamembranous).

## Function
The INSIG1 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis and lipid metabolism in healthy human cells. INSIG1 is a polytopic membrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is involved in the regulation of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), which are transcription factors that activate genes responsible for cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis (Gong2006Juxtamembranous; Roth2008Regulatory). 

INSIG1 functions by binding to the SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) in a sterol-dependent manner, retaining the SCAP-SREBP complex in the ER membrane. This retention prevents the transport of SREBPs to the Golgi apparatus, thereby inhibiting their activation and reducing the expression of genes involved in lipid biosynthesis (Ouyang2020Emerging; Roth2008Regulatory). 

In addition to its role in SREBP regulation, INSIG1 also facilitates the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), the enzyme responsible for the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis (Gong2006Juxtamembranous; Dong2010Insulin-induced). Through these mechanisms, INSIG1 helps maintain lipid balance and energy homeostasis, preventing excessive lipid accumulation and associated metabolic disorders (Ouyang2020Emerging).

## Clinical Significance
The INSIG1 gene is clinically significant due to its role in lipid metabolism and its association with various metabolic disorders. Alterations in INSIG1 expression are linked to conditions such as diabetic dyslipidemia, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and obesity. Increased expression of INSIG1 has been shown to alleviate hyperlipidemia and insulin resistance, while its overexpression can reduce hepatic steatosis and plasma cholesterol levels (Ouyang2020Emerging).

In the context of obesity and insulin resistance, decreased expression of INSIG1 in adipose tissue is observed, which facilitates lipid biosynthesis and storage, potentially as an adaptive response to metabolic stress (Carobbio2013Adaptive). This downregulation is associated with increased triglyceride accumulation and enhanced lipogenesis, particularly through the induction of SCD1 (Carobbio2013Adaptive).

INSIG1 is also implicated in liver conditions characterized by large lipid droplet accumulation and fibrosis. Low expression of INSIG1 is associated with high intracellular cholesterol content and increased fibrogenic capacity, contributing to liver fibrosis development (Ferri2021The). These findings highlight the potential of INSIG1 as a therapeutic target for lipid-related disorders.

## Interactions
INSIG1 is involved in several critical protein interactions that regulate cholesterol homeostasis. It interacts with the membrane-bound ubiquitin ligase gp78, forming a complex that facilitates the ubiquitination and degradation of HMG CoA reductase, a key enzyme in cholesterol synthesis. This interaction is sterol-regulated, with sterols promoting the binding of HMG CoA reductase to INSIG1, leading to its degradation (Song2005Gp78). INSIG1 also interacts with Scap, a polytopic ER protein, to regulate the transport of the Scap/SREBP complex. In the presence of sterols, INSIG1 retains the Scap/SREBP complex in the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing its movement to the Golgi and subsequent activation of genes for cholesterol synthesis (Gong2006Sterol-regulated).

The interaction between INSIG1 and gp78 is constitutive, but sterols can modulate this interaction by stabilizing INSIG1 and reducing gp78 binding, which is essential for the sterol-mediated inhibition of the gp78-INSIG1 complex formation (Lee2006Sterol-regulated). INSIG1 also forms a complex with VCP, an ATPase involved in ER-associated degradation, through its interaction with gp78, which acts as a bridge between INSIG1 and VCP (Song2005Gp78). These interactions highlight the role of INSIG1 in the feedback control of cholesterol synthesis and uptake.
