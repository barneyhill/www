# PRDM5

## Overview
PRDM5 is a gene that encodes the PR/SET domain 5 protein, a transcriptional regulator involved in chromatin organization and gene expression. The PR/SET domain 5 protein is characterized by a PR domain and multiple zinc finger motifs, which facilitate its role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation (Duan2007Epigenetic; Deng2004PRDM5). Although it lacks intrinsic histone methyltransferase activity, the protein recruits histone-modifying enzymes to modulate chromatin structure and gene expression (Duan2007Epigenetic). PRDM5 is implicated in various biological processes, including the development and maintenance of the extracellular matrix, bone development, and hematopoiesis (Galli2012Prdm5; Burkitt2011Mutations). Clinically, mutations and altered expression of PRDM5 are associated with diseases such as brittle cornea syndrome and various cancers, where it may function as a tumor suppressor or, in some contexts, an oncogene (Porter2015A; Casamassimi2020Multifaceted).

## Structure
PRDM5 is a protein encoded by the PRDM5 gene, characterized by a molecular structure that includes an open reading frame of 630 amino acids. The protein features a PR domain at the NH-terminal region, which is homologous to the SET domain involved in chromatin-associated proteins and gene expression (Deng2004PRDM5). Following the PR domain, PRDM5 contains 16 C2H2-type zinc finger motifs, which are crucial for its role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation (Duan2007Epigenetic; Galli2012Prdm5).

PRDM5 does not possess intrinsic histone methyltransferase activity but can recruit histone-modifying enzymes such as G9a and histone deacetylases (HDACs) to target gene promoters, facilitating histone modifications like H3-K9 methylation and deacetylation (Duan2007Epigenetic; Di2021The). This recruitment is essential for its function as a transcriptional repressor or activator, depending on the context (Duan2007Epigenetic).

The protein is also involved in chromatin organization, interacting with insulator binding proteins such as CTCF and cohesin complexes, which suggests a role in genome organization and transcriptional regulation (Galli2013Genomic). PRDM5's structure and interactions highlight its significance in transcriptional regulation and potential tumor suppressive functions.

## Function
PRDM5 is a transcriptional regulator involved in the development and maintenance of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in healthy human cells. It plays a crucial role in regulating the expression of collagen genes and other ECM components, which are essential for maintaining tissue integrity and function (Galli2012Prdm5; Burkitt2011Mutations). PRDM5 is highly expressed in developing bones, where it influences collagen gene transcription by associating with RNA polymerase II, ensuring proper collagen fibrillogenesis and bone development (Galli2012Prdm5).

In addition to its role in bone development, PRDM5 is involved in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. It acts as a transcriptional repressor by recruiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) and histone methyltransferases (HMTases) to its target gene promoters, although it can also function as a transcriptional activator in certain contexts (Duan2007Epigenetic). PRDM5's activity in the nucleus impacts cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis, contributing to the regulation of genes associated with hematopoiesis and other developmental processes (Duan2007Epigenetic). Its function is critical for maintaining the structural integrity of tissues and normal cellular communication (Burkitt2011Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the PRDM5 gene are associated with several diseases. In brittle cornea syndrome (BCS), mutations such as Δ9-14, c.1768C>T p.Arg590*, c.247C>T p.Arg83Cys, and c.400G>T p.Glu134* lead to significant clinical features including corneal thinning, rupture, blue sclera, myopia, scoliosis, joint hypermobility, and retinal abnormalities (Porter2015A; Porter2015Bruch’s). These mutations affect the gene's role in maintaining corneal integrity and are linked to structural abnormalities in Bruch's membrane (Porter2015Bruch’s).

In cancer, PRDM5 is frequently silenced through promoter CpG island methylation, particularly in breast, ovarian, liver, gastric, and colorectal cancers. This silencing is associated with tumor suppressive activities, such as G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Deng2004PRDM5; Casamassimi2020Multifaceted). PRDM5's role as a tumor suppressor is highlighted by its ability to inhibit oncogenes and antagonize WNT/β-catenin signaling (Shu2011The). However, in melanoma, PRDM5 may act as an oncogene, promoting tumor progression (Casamassimi2020Multifaceted).

In Crohn's Disease, PRDM5 is up-regulated in inflamed tissues, promoting apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells, which may contribute to disease progression (Wu2017PRDM5).

## Interactions
PRDM5 is involved in various protein interactions that play a significant role in chromatin organization and gene regulation. It interacts with insulator binding proteins such as CTCF, cohesin components (Smc1 and Smc3), and TFIIIC, co-occupying genomic loci with these proteins. These interactions suggest that PRDM5 contributes to chromatin organization by influencing the occupancy of CTCF and cohesin at common sites (Galli2013Genomic).

PRDM5 also interacts with the transcription factor Gfi1, forming complexes that can act as transcriptional activators or repressors depending on the context. This interaction is facilitated by PRDM5's zinc fingers and is crucial for its role in hematopoiesis and gene regulation (Duan2007Epigenetic). PRDM5 recruits histone-modifying enzymes, such as G9a and class I histone deacetylases, to its target gene promoters, leading to histone modifications like H3-K9 methylation and deacetylation of H3 and H4 (Duan2007Epigenetic).

In embryonic stem cells, PRDM5 is highly expressed and interacts with proteins involved in chromatin organization, such as TFIIIC and CTCF-Smc1 complexes, indicating its role in maintaining chromatin structure and transcriptional regulation during early development (Galli2013Genomic).
