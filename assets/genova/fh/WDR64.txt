# WDR64

## Overview
The WDR64 gene encodes the WD repeat domain 64 protein, which is characterized by the presence of WD repeat motifs. These motifs are typically involved in protein-protein interactions, suggesting that WDR64 may play a role in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins. The WD repeat domain 64 protein is implicated in several biological pathways, although its precise functions remain to be fully elucidated. Research has indicated potential involvement in the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway, highlighting its significance in cellular signaling and regulation (Qiu2020aarFDC). Further studies are necessary to understand the full spectrum of its biological roles and its implications in health and disease.
