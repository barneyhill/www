# DGAT1

## Overview
The DGAT1 gene encodes the enzyme diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1, a critical component in lipid metabolism, specifically in the synthesis of triglycerides. This enzyme is categorized as a membrane protein and is predominantly located in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it facilitates the conversion of diacylglycerol and acyl-CoA into triglycerides, a key step in energy storage and lipid homeostasis (BhattWessel2018Role; van2018Intestinal). The DGAT1 protein is characterized by multiple transmembrane domains, which are essential for its function in lipid absorption and storage. It plays a significant role in the intestines, where it is involved in fat absorption and the regulation of postprandial hormones, contributing to energy balance and glucose homeostasis (BhattWessel2018Role). Mutations in the DGAT1 gene are linked to congenital disorders affecting lipid metabolism, underscoring its importance in maintaining normal physiological functions (van2018Intestinal).

## Structure
The human DGAT1 protein is a multi-pass membrane protein with a significant hydrophobic nature, containing approximately 36% hydrophobic amino acid residues. Computational models predict that DGAT1 could have between 8 and 10 transmembrane domains (TMDs), although experimental data for murine DGAT1 suggest it may have only three TMDs (BhattWessel2018Role). The N-terminus is oriented toward the cytosol, and the C-terminal region accounts for about 50% of the sequence present in the ER lumen, with catalytic activity on the luminal side of the ER membrane (BhattWessel2018Role). The topology of DGAT1 includes an extended N-terminus within the ER lumen and specific regions between transmembrane regions that are conserved across vertebrates, indicating functional significance (Holmes2010Comparative).

The catalytic residues for human DGAT1 include Asn378 and His415, with a heptapeptide sequence recognized as a potential fatty acyl CoA binding site (Holmes2010Comparative). DGAT1 forms dimers and tetramers, with the dimer form potentially being more catalytically active. The N-terminus is responsible for tetramer formation, while the C-terminus is dispensable (BhattWessel2018Role). The protein's activity is regulated through allosteric interactions with acyl-CoAs (BhattWessel2018Role).

## Function
The DGAT1 gene encodes the enzyme diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1, which plays a crucial role in triacylglycerol (TAG) metabolism by catalyzing the final step of triglyceride synthesis. This enzyme is involved in the conversion of diacylglycerol (DAG) and acyl-CoA into triglycerides, a process essential for lipid metabolism and energy storage in healthy human cells (BhattWessel2018Role; van2018Intestinal). DGAT1 is a membrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum and is predicted to have multiple transmembrane domains, facilitating its role in lipid absorption and storage (BhattWessel2018Role).

In the intestines, DGAT1 is vital for normal fat absorption, and its activity is linked to the regulation of postprandial hormones such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), which are important for maintaining energy balance and glucose homeostasis (BhattWessel2018Role). DGAT1 is also involved in the formation of lipid droplets, which are crucial for the storage and transport of long-chain free fatty acids into chylomicrons, facilitating lipid excretion across the basolateral membrane of enterocytes (van2018Intestinal). The enzyme's activity is subject to allosteric regulation and shows positive cooperativity with acyl-CoA levels, indicating its role in esterifying pre-formed fatty acids (BhattWessel2018Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DGAT1 gene are associated with several congenital disorders, primarily affecting lipid metabolism and intestinal function. DGAT1 deficiency is linked to congenital diarrheal disorders (CDDs), characterized by severe diarrhea and nutrient malabsorption. This condition is often due to bi-allelic loss-of-function mutations in DGAT1, leading to reduced protein expression and altered triacylglycerol metabolism. Patients with DGAT1 deficiency exhibit decreased lipid droplet formation and increased susceptibility to lipid-induced cell death, highlighting the enzyme's crucial role in fat metabolism and lipotoxicity in the intestinal epithelium (van2018Intestinal).

Congenital protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) is another condition associated with DGAT1 mutations. PLE is characterized by increased protein loss from the gastrointestinal system, hypoproteinemia, fat malabsorption, and malnutrition. Patients often present with chronic diarrhea, hypoalbuminemia, and failure to thrive (Stephen2016Congenital). Genetic testing has identified various mutations, including compound heterozygous mutations, which result in frameshift and nonsense mutations, leading to truncated proteins (Li2023Case).

DGAT1 mutations can also lead to delayed chronic diarrhea, with symptoms such as vomiting, hypoalbuminemia, and failure to thrive. These mutations may inhibit chylomicron secretion and delay gastric emptying, contributing to the clinical presentation (Xu2020DGAT1).
