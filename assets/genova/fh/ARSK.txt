# ARSK

## Overview
The ARSK gene encodes the enzyme arylsulfatase K, a member of the arylsulfatase family, which is involved in the lysosomal degradation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). This enzyme is characterized by its ability to specifically remove the 2-O-sulfate group from 2-sulfoglucuronate, a critical step in the breakdown of GAGs such as heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate (Verheyen2021Novel; Dhamale2017Arylsulfatase). The ARSK protein is distinct from other human arylsulfatases, sharing less than 27% sequence identity, and is classified as a unique enzyme within this family (Holmes2018Vertebrate). It is expressed in various human tissues, with notable expression in fibroblasts and tibial nerve cells, indicating its involvement in diverse physiological processes (Holmes2018Vertebrate). Mutations in the ARSK gene are linked to a novel subtype of mucopolysaccharidosis, known as MPS X, which is characterized by the accumulation of GAGs due to impaired enzyme activity (Sun2024A).

## Structure
The ARSK protein, encoded by the ARSK gene, is a member of the arylsulfatase family and consists of 523-556 amino acids, with a primary structure that includes conserved active site residues for calcium ion and substrate binding (Holmes2018Vertebrate). The protein features an N-terminus signal peptide spanning residues 1-22 and multiple N-glycosylation sites, which vary among vertebrate species (Holmes2018Vertebrate). The secondary structure of human ARSK is predicted to include α-helices and β-sheets, with specific residues corresponding to exon start sites (Holmes2018Vertebrate).

The tertiary structure of ARSK, modeled using a putative sulfatase from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, reveals a large active site cleft containing a calcium ion. The enzyme is composed of two major domains: a larger N-terminal domain housing the active site and a C-terminal domain predominantly consisting of β-sheets and a large α-helix (Holmes2018Vertebrate). The tertiary structure is similar to other human arylsulfatases, indicating strong conservation in amino acid sequences and structures (Holmes2018Vertebrate). The quaternary structure of ARSK is not detailed in the available sources. The ARSK protein is classified as a distinct enzyme with less than 27% sequence identity to other human arylsulfatases (Holmes2018Vertebrate).

## Function
The ARSK gene encodes the enzyme arylsulfatase K, which plays a critical role in the degradation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) within lysosomes. This enzyme specifically removes the 2-O-sulfate group from 2-sulfoglucuronate, a necessary step in the breakdown of GAGs such as heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate (Verheyen2021Novel; Dhamale2017Arylsulfatase). ARSK is characterized by its high substrate specificity and does not overlap functionally with other sulfatases, highlighting its unique role in cellular metabolism (Verheyen2021Novel).

In healthy human cells, ARSK is essential for maintaining normal cellular and tissue homeostasis by facilitating the breakdown and recycling of sulfated GAGs, which are important components of connective tissue (Verheyen2021Novel). The enzyme's activity is dependent on a post-translational modification of a conserved cysteine residue into an α-formylglycine, which is crucial for its enzymatic function (Holmes2018Vertebrate). ARSK is expressed in various human tissues, with the highest levels found in fibroblasts and tibial nerve cells, suggesting its involvement in a broad range of physiological processes (Holmes2018Vertebrate). Deficiency or malfunction of ARSK can lead to lysosomal storage disorders, underscoring its importance in cellular function (Dhamale2017Arylsulfatase).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ARSK gene are associated with a novel subtype of mucopolysaccharidosis, termed MPS X. This condition is characterized by the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans due to defective lysosomal enzyme activity, specifically the inability to remove the 2-O-sulfate group from 2-sulfoglucuronate. A homozygous missense variant, c.1067C>A (p.S356Y), has been identified as causing a complete loss of ARSK enzyme activity, leading to this disorder. Patients with MPS X exhibit mild mucopolysaccharidosis features, such as elevated dermatan sulfate levels in urine, skeletal abnormalities like Perthes disease and pectus carinatum, but typically do not experience cognitive effects. The condition may be underdiagnosed due to its similarity to skeletal dysplasias (Sun2024A).

To date, only a few ARSK variants have been documented, affecting a small number of individuals from unrelated families, all suggesting the presence of MPS X. The incidence of ARSK-related mucopolysaccharidosis is expected to be low based on allele frequency data. Molecular genetic testing and functional assessment are crucial for diagnosing this condition (Sun2024A).
