# RRS1

## Overview
The RRS1 gene encodes the ribosome biogenesis regulator 1 homolog, a protein integral to the assembly and maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit. This protein is primarily active in the nucleolus, where it functions as a ribosome assembly factor, facilitating the recruitment of essential ribosomal components such as 5S rRNA and ribosomal proteins RpL5 and RpL11 into nascent ribosomes (Zhang2007Assembly). The RRS1 protein forms a complex with Rpf2, which is crucial for the maturation of 66S preribosomes and the processing of 27SB pre-rRNA, acting as a checkpoint in ribosome biogenesis (Zhang2007Assembly; Asano2015Structural). Structurally, RRS1 is characterized by a ββαββ topology and a proline-rich C-terminal loop that interacts with Rpf2, ensuring the structural integrity of the ribosomal assembly (Kharde2015The; Asano2015Structural). Clinically, alterations in RRS1 expression are associated with various cancers, including breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, where it influences tumor growth, metastasis, and drug resistance, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Hua2021Advances; Song2018Functional).

## Structure
The RRS1 protein, encoded by the RRS1 gene, plays a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis. Its primary structure consists of 365 amino acids with a molecular mass of 41,193 KDa (Hua2021Advances). The secondary structure of RRS1 includes a single long α-helix and four short β-strands, contributing to its ββαββ topology (Kharde2015The; Asano2015Structural). The tertiary structure is characterized by a proline-rich C-terminal loop that wraps around the Rpf2 protein, indicating its importance in maintaining structural integrity (Asano2015Structural).

In terms of quaternary structure, RRS1 forms a complex with Rpf2, which is essential for ribosome assembly. This complex involves hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, with RRS1 completing the Brix domain of Rpf2 and forming a tight interface (Kharde2015The; Asano2015Structural). The RRS1 protein also contains a proline-rich region and a C-terminal tail that interacts with 25S rRNA, stabilizing the ribosomal subunit (Kharde2015The; Thoms2018Suppressor).

Post-translational modifications include acetylation at the N-terminus and phosphorylation at Arg344 (Hua2021Advances). The RRS1 gene does not produce alternatively spliced isoforms, resulting in a single mRNA transcript (Hua2021Advances).

## Function
The RRS1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis, particularly in the assembly and maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit. In healthy human cells, the RRS1 protein is primarily active in the nucleolus, where it functions as a ribosome assembly factor. It is involved in the recruitment of 5S rRNA and ribosomal proteins RpL5 and RpL11 into nascent ribosomes, forming a stable complex essential for the early stages of ribosome assembly (Zhang2007Assembly).

The Rpf2-Rrs1 complex, which includes RRS1, is necessary for the proper maturation of 66S preribosomes and the processing of 27SB pre-rRNA. This complex ensures the correct recruitment of ribosomal components, acting as a checkpoint in ribosome biogenesis (Zhang2007Assembly; Asano2015Structural). The RRS1 protein interacts with other ribosomal proteins and assembly factors, such as the membrane-spanning SUN domain protein Mps3 and the silent information factor Sir4, which are involved in telomere clustering and silencing (Asano2015Structural).

The structural integrity and function of the Rpf2-Rrs1 complex are maintained by specific interactions, including a proline-rich loop in Rrs1 that wraps around Rpf2, facilitating the separation of Rrs1's N- and C-terminal domains (Asano2015Structural). These interactions are crucial for preventing misfolded rRNA and ensuring proper ribosome assembly (Kharde2015The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RRS1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer. Overexpression of RRS1 is linked to tumor growth and metastasis, indicating its role in cancer progression. In breast cancer, RRS1 is highly expressed, promoting proliferation and reducing apoptosis, making it a potential therapeutic target (Hua2021Advances; Song2018Functional). RRS1 also contributes to cisplatin resistance in breast cancer cells by stabilizing AEG-1, which promotes drug resistance (Song2023Ribosome).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, high RRS1 expression correlates with poor survival rates, and its silencing induces cell cycle arrest (Hua2021Advances). In neuroblastoma, elevated RRS1 expression is associated with poor prognosis and metastasis, and its knockdown disrupts the PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway, reducing cell proliferation and increasing apoptosis (Zhang2022RRS1).

RRS1 is also implicated in Huntington's disease, where it is linked to endoplasmic reticulum stress, contributing to disease pathogenesis (Hua2021Advances). These findings suggest that RRS1 expression alterations have significant clinical implications, serving as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in various diseases.

## Interactions
RRS1 is involved in ribosome biogenesis and participates in several critical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It forms a complex with Rpf2, which is essential for the recruitment of 5S rRNA and ribosomal proteins rpL5 and rpL11 into nascent ribosomes. This interaction is crucial for the assembly of these components into preribosomal particles and the processing of 27SB pre-rRNA (Zhang2007Assembly; Asano2015Structural). The Rpf2-Rrs1 complex binds directly to 5S rRNA, and specific mutations in Rpf2 can affect this binding, highlighting the importance of this interaction in ribosome biogenesis (Asano2015Structural).

The Rrs1 protein also interacts with the ubiquitin-like domain of Rsa4, and its C-terminal tail forms significant interactions with 25S rRNA, stabilizing the rRNA conformation and inhibiting the rotation of the 5S RNP (Kharde2015The). In yeast, Rrs1 interacts with ribosomal proteins L5 and L11, and these interactions are critical for the proper assembly of the 60S ribosomal subunit (Nariai2005Synergistic). The leucine at position 65 in Rrs1 is particularly important for these interactions, as mutations at this site can disrupt the binding with L5 and L11 (Asano2015Structural).
