# FN1

## Overview
The FN1 gene encodes fibronectin 1, a multifunctional glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Fibronectin 1 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, growth, and differentiation, and is essential for maintaining tissue integrity. It exists in both soluble and insoluble forms, with the former circulating in the bloodstream and the latter being a structural component of the ECM. The protein interacts with cell surface receptors, such as integrins, facilitating communication between the ECM and the intracellular cytoskeleton, and is involved in signaling pathways like PI3K/Akt, which are crucial for cell survival and apoptosis regulation (Pankov2002Fibronectin; Ji2020Fibronectin). The FN1 gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that contribute to its functional diversity. Mutations in FN1 are linked to various diseases, including fibronectin glomerulopathy and certain skeletal dysplasias, and its altered expression is implicated in cancer progression and Alzheimer's disease (Bhattarai2024Rare; Dinesh2023Mutations).

## Structure
Fibronectin 1 (FN1) is a glycoprotein composed of two nearly identical subunits, each approximately 250 kDa, linked by disulfide bonds at the C-terminus (Pankov2002Fibronectin; Spada2021Fibronectin). The primary structure of FN1 includes three types of repeating domains: type I, type II, and type III. FN1 contains 12 type I repeats, 2 type II repeats, and 15-17 type III repeats, which account for about 90% of the protein's sequence (Pankov2002Fibronectin; Spada2021Fibronectin). 

The secondary structure of FN1 features β-strands that form β-sheets, particularly in the type I and type III modules. Type I modules consist of five β-strands forming two β-sheets, stabilized by disulfide bonds (Diao2009Interplay). Type III modules are composed of approximately 90 residues organized into seven β-strands forming two antiparallel β-sheets (Spada2021Fibronectin).

FN1's tertiary structure is modular, with each domain contributing to the protein's overall conformation. The quaternary structure involves FN1 existing as dimers or multimers, crucial for its function in the extracellular matrix (Pankov2002Fibronectin; Spada2021Fibronectin).

FN1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and phosphorylation, which contribute to its functional diversity. The gene encoding FN1 is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in up to 20 different isoforms, which include variations in the type III domains, particularly the EDA and EDB regions (Pankov2002Fibronectin; Spada2021Fibronectin).

## Function
Fibronectin 1 (FN1) is a glycoprotein that plays a critical role in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, growth, and differentiation. It is a major component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and is involved in maintaining tissue integrity by interacting with cell surface receptors and other matrix components (Pankov2002Fibronectin; Speziale2019Fibronectin). FN1 exists in both soluble and insoluble forms, with the soluble form produced by hepatocytes and secreted into the bloodstream, while fibroblasts and endothelial cells synthesize the insoluble form (Speziale2019Fibronectin).

FN1 is essential for embryonic development, as evidenced by the embryonic lethality observed in FN1 knockout mice, which exhibit severe cardiac and vascular disorders (Ji2020Fibronectin). The protein is involved in wound healing, blood coagulation, and host defense mechanisms (Waalkes2010Fibronectin). FN1 interacts with integrin receptors, linking the ECM with the intracellular cytoskeleton, and can trigger distinct intracellular signals (Pankov2002Fibronectin). It also plays a role in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell survival and apoptosis regulation (Ji2020Fibronectin). FN1's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular and tissue homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FN1 gene, which encodes fibronectin, are associated with several diseases. Fibronectin glomerulopathy is a rare autosomal dominant kidney disorder characterized by massive fibronectin deposits in the glomeruli, leading to symptoms such as proteinuria, hematuria, and hypertension. This condition is linked to specific FN1 mutations, including Y973C, W1925R, and L1974R, which affect the heparin-binding domains of fibronectin, altering its interactions and fibrillogenesis (Nadamuni2012Fibronectin; Hirashio2017A; dos2019A).

FN1 mutations also play a role in skeletal dysplasias, such as spondylometaphyseal dysplasia with 'corner fractures' (SMD-CF). These mutations disrupt fibronectin secretion and assembly, leading to intracellular accumulation and impaired extracellular matrix formation. This results in skeletal abnormalities, including short stature, scoliosis, and coxa vara (Cadoff2018Mechanistic; Costantini2019Novel; Dinesh2023Mutations).

Alterations in FN1 expression are implicated in cancer progression. In papillary thyroid carcinomas, FN1 overexpression is associated with increased tumor aggressiveness, enhancing cancer cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, and invasion (Sponziello2016Fibronectin1). Additionally, FN1 is involved in Alzheimer's disease, where its excess deposition can contribute to blood-brain barrier breakdown, particularly in individuals with the APOEε4 genotype (Bhattarai2024Rare).

## Interactions
Fibronectin 1 (FN1) is a key component of the extracellular matrix and interacts with various proteins, playing a crucial role in cell adhesion and signaling. FN1 binds to integrins, such as α5β1 and αv-class integrins, through its RGD motif located in the FNIII10 module. The FNIII9 module contains a synergy site that enhances the binding of α5β1 and αIIbβ3 integrins, reinforcing integrin binding under mechanical forces (BenitoJardón2017The). 

FN1 also interacts with bacterial fibronectin-binding proteins (FnBPs) from pathogens like Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. These interactions are significant for bacterial invasion, as FnBPs bind to FN1 modules, affecting their mechanical and binding properties. The binding of FnBP peptides reduces the flexibility of the linker region between FN1 modules, stabilizing the inter-domain configuration under force (Diao2009Interplay).

FN1's interactions with integrins are modulated by mechanical forces, which can alter its conformation and binding affinity. Under tension, FN1 modules undergo structural changes that affect integrin binding, influencing cell signaling pathways and cellular responses to mechanical stress (Krammer2002A). These interactions are essential for FN1's role in cell adhesion, migration, and tissue repair.
