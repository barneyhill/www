# MT1M

## Overview
MT1M, or metallothionein 1M, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the metallothionein family, which is characterized by its high cysteine content and ability to bind metal ions. The MT1M protein plays a critical role in metal ion homeostasis, particularly in the regulation and detoxification of zinc and copper ions, which are vital for numerous cellular processes. This protein is involved in cellular antioxidant defense, helping to protect cells from oxidative stress and metal toxicity. MT1M is expressed in various tissues and is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it modulates metal ion concentrations and participates in detoxification processes. The gene's expression is regulated by transcription factors and promoter sequences that respond to environmental stimuli, including metals and stressors, underscoring its importance in stress response and metal metabolism (Li2008Human; Krężel2017The).

## Structure
The MT1M protein is a member of the metallothionein family, characterized by a high cysteine content, which facilitates its role in metal ion binding and detoxification. The primary structure of MT1M includes a sequence rich in cysteine residues, essential for its metal-binding capabilities (Rahman2017Origin). The secondary structure of metallothioneins typically involves alpha helices and beta sheets, although specific details for MT1M are not provided in the available context. The tertiary structure of MT1M is compact, forming a metal-binding domain that is crucial for its function in metal ion homeostasis (Rahman2017Origin).

MT1M does not form quaternary structures, which is common among metallothioneins. Post-translational modifications of MT1M include metal ion binding and the oxidation of cysteine residues, which are vital for its activity in detoxification processes (Rahman2017Origin). The protein's structure allows it to participate in various physiological processes, including the response to oxidative stress and the regulation of metal ion concentrations within cells. While specific domains and prominent folds are not detailed for MT1M, its structural characteristics align with those of other metallothionein isoforms, supporting its functional roles in the human body.

## Function
MT1M (metallothionein 1M) is involved in metal ion homeostasis, particularly in the binding and regulation of zinc and copper ions. Metallothioneins, including MT1M, play a crucial role in maintaining metal homeostasis within cells by binding metal ions like Zn2+ and Cu+, which is essential for cellular processes and protection against metal toxicity (Krężel2017The). MT1M is noted for having a histidine at position 46, an unusual feature for metallothioneins, which may influence its metal-binding properties, although the physiological significance of this variation is not fully understood (Li2008Human).

MT1M is expressed in various tissues and is involved in cellular antioxidant defense, contributing to the regulation of metal ion availability and protection against oxidative stress (Krężel2017The). The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it participates in detoxification processes and the modulation of metal ion concentrations, which are critical for cellular function and survival (Li2008Human). The regulation of MT1M expression is influenced by transcription factors and promoter sequences, which respond to various stimuli, including metals and stressors, highlighting its role in stress response and metal metabolism (Laukens2009Human).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the MT1M gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions, particularly in the context of cancer. In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), MT1M exhibits higher methylation levels in tumor tissues compared to healthy tissues, which correlates with downregulated gene expression. This methylation is more common in tumors with higher Fuhrman grades and larger sizes, suggesting a role in tumor aggressiveness and progression (Maleckaite2019DNA). The methylation status of MT1M, along with MT1E, has been proposed as a potential biomarker for RCC diagnosis, with significant specificity and sensitivity (Maleckaite2019DNA).

In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), MT1M is a target of miR-545-3p, which downregulates its expression. This interaction is part of a regulatory axis involving LINC00261, which modulates cisplatin resistance in ESCC. Overexpression of MT1M can counteract the effects of miR-545-3p, suggesting its role in drug resistance mechanisms (Wang2021LINC00261).

MT1M polymorphisms also influence the body's handling of heavy metals, affecting conditions related to metal toxicity. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in MT1M have been associated with variations in mercury levels in the body, indicating potential clinical implications in metal metabolism (Raudenska2014Metallothionein).
