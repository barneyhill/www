# TDRD5

## Overview
TDRD5 is a gene that encodes the tudor domain containing 5 protein, which is integral to the piRNA pathway and germ cell development. The protein is characterized by the presence of a Tudor domain and three LOTUS domains, which facilitate its interaction with PIWI proteins, such as MILI and MIWI, in animal germ cells. This interaction is crucial for the processing of piRNA precursors, which are essential for maintaining genomic integrity by silencing transposable elements. TDRD5's role in piRNA biogenesis is vital for spermatogenesis, and its absence or mutation can lead to infertility due to spermatogenic arrest. Beyond its reproductive functions, TDRD5 has been implicated in cancer, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma, where it is involved in cell cycle regulation and DNA repair (Wang2019Genome‑wide; Ding2018TDRD5; Babakhanzadeh2020Testicular).

## Structure
The TDRD5 protein contains a single Tudor domain and three LOTUS domains. The Tudor domain is known for its conserved binding to PIWI proteins, specifically MILI and MIWI, in animal germ cells. This interaction is facilitated by the Tudor domain's ability to recognize methylated arginine or lysine residues through conserved aromatic binding pockets (Gan2019Structure; Ding2018TDRD5). The LOTUS domains are located at the N-terminus of the protein (Deng2022TDRD5).

The Tudor domain of TDRD5 is part of the 'Royal Family' of domains, which typically recognize methylated residues, crucial for protein-protein interactions (Gan2019Structure). The eTudor domain, which includes a canonical Tudor domain, an alpha-helix linker, and a staphylococcal nuclease-like domain, is essential for binding to PIWI proteins (Gan2019Structure).

TDRD5 is an RNA-binding protein that directly associates with piRNA precursors, playing a critical role in piRNA processing. It binds along the entire length of piRNA precursors, indicating its broad stabilizing role (Ding2018TDRD5). The protein's structure and interactions are vital for its function in piRNA biogenesis and germ cell development.

## Function
TDRD5 (tudor domain containing 5) is a protein that plays a crucial role in piRNA biogenesis and germ cell development. It is involved in the processing of pachytene piRNAs, which are essential for maintaining genomic integrity in germ cells by silencing transposable elements (Ding2018TDRD5). TDRD5 interacts with PIWI proteins through its Tudor domain, facilitating the binding and processing of piRNA precursors (Ding2018TDRD5). This interaction is critical for the regulation of piRNA biogenesis, as TDRD5 binds to piRNA precursors along their entire lengths, stabilizing them for efficient processing (Ding2018TDRD5).

In the context of spermatogenesis, TDRD5 is expressed in the germline and cytoplasm, where it interacts with MIWI and MILI, types of PIWI proteins, to support the production of piRNAs necessary for normal sperm development (Gan2019Structure). The absence or mutation of TDRD5 can lead to spermatogenic arrest and infertility, highlighting its essential role in germ cell development (Babakhanzadeh2020Testicular). TDRD5's function in piRNA processing is crucial for the prevention of DNA damage in germ cells, ensuring proper spermatogenesis and male fertility (Ding2018TDRD5).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TDRD5 gene have been linked to male infertility, particularly in cases of non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA). Studies have shown that TDRD5 expression is significantly reduced in testicular tissues of patients with NOA, including those with Sertoli cell-only syndrome (SCOS), maturation arrest (MA), and hypospermatogenesis (HP), compared to those with obstructive azoospermia (OA) (Babakhanzadeh2020Testicular). This reduced expression is associated with defects in spermatogenesis, as TDRD5 plays a crucial role in the development of sperm cells. In animal models, the loss of TDRD5 has been shown to result in the absence of spermatozoa and infertility, with mutations causing arrest at the round spermatid stage and disorganization of chromatoid bodies (Babakhanzadeh2020Testicular).

In addition to its role in reproductive health, TDRD5 has been implicated in cancer. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TDRD5 is involved in critical cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and DNA repair. It is considered significant for the diagnosis and prognosis of HCC, with its expression levels being correlated with other protein-coding genes in the disease (Wang2019Genome‑wide).

## Interactions
TDRD5, a protein containing a Tudor domain, is involved in the piRNA pathway and interacts with PIWI proteins, such as MILI and MIWI, which are essential for piRNA biogenesis in animal germ cells. The Tudor domain of TDRD5 is primarily responsible for its interaction with these PIWI proteins. This interaction has been confirmed through experiments where TDRD5 was co-expressed with MILI or MIWI in HEK293T cells, and TDRD5 was detected in both MILI and MIWI immunoprecipitates (Ding2018TDRD5).

TDRD5 also directly binds to piRNA precursors, as demonstrated by UV cross-linking immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing of RNA isolated by cross-linking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP or CLIP-seq) in testes from adult wild-type mice. The CLIP-seq results showed that TDRD5-CLIP reads mapped to piRNA clusters, indicating TDRD5's role in piRNA precursor processing. TDRD5 binds along the entire length of piRNA precursors, without a clear preference for specific regions, suggesting its regulatory role in piRNA biogenesis through direct association with piRNA precursors (Ding2018TDRD5).

TDRD5 is localized at the intermitochondrial cement (IMC), supporting its role in piRNA precursor stabilization and processing. It is essential for the processing of pachytene piRNA precursors, particularly in stabilizing and retaining these precursors within the piRNA processing complex for efficient processing (Ding2018TDRD5).
