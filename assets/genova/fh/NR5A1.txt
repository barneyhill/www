# NR5A1

## Overview
The NR5A1 gene encodes the nuclear receptor subfamily 5 group A member 1, commonly known as steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1), which is a pivotal transcription factor involved in the regulation of steroidogenesis and reproductive development. As a nuclear receptor, SF-1 is characterized by its ability to bind DNA as a monomer, a feature that distinguishes it from many other nuclear receptors (Hoivik2010Molecular). The protein plays a critical role in the development and function of the adrenal glands and gonads, influencing the synthesis of steroid hormones and the regulation of genes necessary for sexual differentiation and fertility (Bashamboo2010Human; Rocca2018Mutational). SF-1's activity is modulated by various post-translational modifications and interactions with coactivators and corepressors, which fine-tune its transcriptional regulation capabilities (Wang2013Distinct; Hoivik2010Molecular). Mutations in the NR5A1 gene are associated with a spectrum of disorders of sex development and reproductive issues, highlighting its clinical significance (Barbaro2011Partial; Luppino2024Role).

## Structure
The NR5A1 gene encodes the steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) protein, a nuclear receptor with a complex molecular structure. SF-1 contains several key domains typical of nuclear receptors: a DNA-binding domain (DBD) with two Cys2-Cys2 zinc finger motifs, a flexible hinge region, a ligand-binding domain (LBD), and two activation function domains (AF-1 and AF-2) (Robevska2017Functional; Hoivik2010Molecular). The DBD is extended by a FTZ-F1 box, which is crucial for DNA anchoring and specificity of monomeric DNA binding (Hoivik2010Molecular). The LBD is composed of 12 helices and is involved in interactions with various cofactors (Robevska2017Functional).

SF-1 is characterized by its ability to bind DNA as a monomer with high affinity to specific sequences, a feature that distinguishes it from many other nuclear receptors (Hoivik2010Molecular). The protein undergoes several post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at serine 203, acetylation, and SUMOylation at lysine residues K119 and K194, which regulate its activity and interactions (Hoivik2010Molecular). These modifications influence SF-1's recruitment to target genes and its interaction with co-activators, playing a significant role in its function as a transcription factor (Hoivik2010Molecular).

## Function
The NR5A1 gene encodes the steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1), a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the regulation of genes involved in steroidogenesis and reproductive development. SF-1 is primarily active in the adrenal glands and gonads, where it influences the synthesis of steroid hormones. In fetal Sertoli cells, NR5A1 up-regulates the transcription of SOX9, which is essential for Sertoli cell development and the expression of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) (Rocca2018Mutational). In Leydig cells, NR5A1 activates the expression of steroidogenic enzymes, contributing to the masculinization of external genitalia (Rocca2018Mutational).

NR5A1 is also involved in the regulation of genes necessary for the development of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, impacting fertility and sexual differentiation. It modulates the expression of factors involved in cholesterol mobilization and steroid hormone biosynthesis, such as HMG-CoA synthase, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), and several cytochrome P450 steroid hydroxylase (CYP) enzymes (Bashamboo2010Human). The protein's activity is crucial for maintaining normal sexual development and function, and its dysfunction can lead to a range of disorders of sex development (Rocca2018Mutational).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NR5A1 gene, also known as steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), are associated with a wide range of disorders of sex development (DSD) and reproductive issues. In individuals with a 46,XY karyotype, NR5A1 mutations can lead to conditions such as complete or partial gonadal dysgenesis, hypospadias, micropenis, cryptorchidism, and anorchia. These mutations can result in ambiguous genitalia and misassignment of sex at birth, often leading to delayed diagnosis (Barbaro2011Partial; Luppino2024Role). In 46,XX individuals, NR5A1 mutations are linked to primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), characterized by amenorrhea, estrogen deficiency, and infertility (Lourenço2009Mutations; Bashamboo2016A).

The phenotypic variability of NR5A1 mutations is significant, with some mutations leading to severe forms of DSD or POI, while others result in milder symptoms. This variability is partly due to the lack of a clear genotype-phenotype correlation and the influence of additional genetic or environmental factors (Werner2017New; Camats2012Ten). Specific mutations, such as p.Arg92Trp, have been identified as molecular switches that can alter sex development, leading to testicular or ovotesticular DSD in 46,XX individuals (Bashamboo2016A; Luppino2024Role).

## Interactions
NR5A1, also known as steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1), is a nuclear receptor that interacts with various proteins to regulate gene expression. It forms complexes with coactivators such as SRC-1 and CBP/p300, which enhance its transcriptional activity (Wang2013Distinct). NR5A1 also interacts with corepressors like DAX-1, which inhibits its activity and represses steroidogenic gene expression (Wang2013Distinct).

The protein is sumoylated at lysine residues 119 and 194, a modification that represses its transcriptional activity without affecting DNA binding (Chen2004SUMO). This sumoylation is mediated by the E2-conjugating enzyme UBC9, which interacts with NR5A1 (Chen2004SUMO).

NR5A1 interacts with the LIM domain protein FHL2, which acts as a coactivator by enhancing the transactivation potential of NR5A1 on target genes such as the inhibin-α subunit gene in ovarian granulosa cells (Matulis2012The). This interaction involves the DNA-binding domain and ligand-binding domain of NR5A1, with the FTZ-F1 helix being crucial for the interaction (Matulis2012The).

In the centrosome, NR5A1 forms a complex with Ku70 and Ku80, regulatory subunits of DNA-dependent protein kinase, to maintain centrosome homeostasis (Wang2013Steroidogenic). This interaction is distinct from its nuclear functions and highlights NR5A1's role in cellular processes beyond transcriptional regulation (Wang2013Distinct).
