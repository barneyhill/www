# ZDHHC22

## Overview
ZDHHC22 is a gene that encodes the protein zinc finger DHHC-type palmitoyltransferase 22, which is a member of the DHHC family of palmitoyltransferases. This enzyme is involved in the post-translational modification of proteins through palmitoylation, a process that attaches palmitate to cysteine residues, thereby influencing protein localization, stability, and interactions within the cell (Liao2024The). ZDHHC22 is predominantly active in the Golgi apparatus and plasma membrane, where it plays a significant role in cellular processes such as signal transduction and membrane trafficking (Wild2023CellPalmSeq:). The protein is particularly noted for its interaction with mTOR, a critical regulator of cell growth and proliferation, and has been implicated in various cellular signaling pathways. Research has highlighted its potential role as a tumor suppressor, especially in the context of breast cancer, where its expression levels are linked to clinical outcomes and therapy resistance (Huang2022ZDHHC22-mediated; Huang2021ZDHHC22-Mediated).

## Function
ZDHHC22 is a palmitoyltransferase enzyme that plays a crucial role in the post-translational modification of proteins through palmitoylation, a process that involves the addition of palmitate to cysteine residues on target proteins. This modification is essential for regulating protein localization, stability, and interactions within the cell (Liao2024The). ZDHHC22 is primarily active in the Golgi apparatus and plasma membrane, where it influences various cellular processes, including signal transduction and membrane trafficking (Wild2023CellPalmSeq:).

In healthy human cells, ZDHHC22's enzymatic activity is critical for modulating the stability and activity of mTOR, a key protein involved in cell growth and proliferation. ZDHHC22 enhances the palmitoylation of mTOR, which affects its stability and turnover rate, thereby influencing mTOR's role in cellular signaling pathways (Huang2022ZDHHC22-mediated). This regulation of mTOR by ZDHHC22 is significant for maintaining proper cell cycle progression and apoptosis, which are vital for normal cellular function and organismal homeostasis (Huang2022ZDHHC22-mediated).

While much of the research on ZDHHC22 focuses on its role in cancer, its fundamental function in healthy cells involves maintaining the balance of protein modifications that are crucial for normal cellular operations (Huang2021ZDHHC22-Mediated).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ZDHHC22 gene have been implicated in breast cancer. ZDHHC22 is frequently downregulated in breast cancer, particularly in more aggressive subtypes such as HER2-enriched and basal-like breast carcinoma, compared to luminal-like subtypes. This downregulation is associated with promoter hypermethylation, a key mechanism that reduces ZDHHC22 expression in breast tumors and cell lines, while it is absent in normal breast tissues (Huang2022ZDHHC22-mediated; Huang2021ZDHHC22-Mediated). The reduced expression of ZDHHC22 is linked to poor clinical outcomes, whereas higher expression correlates with better relapse-free survival in breast cancer patients, suggesting its role as a potential tumor suppressor (Huang2021ZDHHC22-Mediated).

ZDHHC22 also plays a role in endocrine therapy resistance. It is often downregulated in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells, and its overexpression can restore sensitivity to tamoxifen treatment. This suggests that ZDHHC22 could be a therapeutic target for overcoming resistance to endocrine therapy (Huang2022ZDHHC22-mediated; Chen2024Protein). The gene's enzymatic activity is crucial for its suppressive effects on breast cancer progression, as demonstrated by experiments showing that mutations in the DHHC motif can negate these effects (Huang2022ZDHHC22-mediated).

## Interactions
ZDHHC22, a palmitoyltransferase, interacts with several proteins, notably mTOR, a key component of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. ZDHHC22 binds to mTOR, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation assays, and this interaction is not disrupted by the C111A mutation, which affects its palmitoyltransferase activity but not its binding affinity (Huang2022ZDHHC22-mediated; Huang2021ZDHHC22-Mediated). The palmitoylation of mTOR by ZDHHC22 decreases mTOR's stability and expression, impacting mTORC1 and mTORC2 kinase activities and reducing AKT phosphorylation at Ser-473 (Huang2022ZDHHC22-mediated). This interaction is significant in breast cancer, where ZDHHC22 acts as a tumor suppressor by modulating mTOR activity, which in turn affects cell growth and therapy resistance (Huang2021ZDHHC22-Mediated).

In addition to mTOR, ZDHHC22 is involved in the palmitoylation of various other proteins, including small GTPases, protein kinases, and transcriptional regulators, as identified in A549 cells (Gadalla2021NS1). These interactions suggest that ZDHHC22 plays a broader role in cellular signaling and protein regulation through its palmitoyltransferase activity.
