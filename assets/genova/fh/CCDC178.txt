# CCDC178

## Overview
The CCDC178 gene encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 178 protein, which is characterized by its coiled-coil structural motif. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. CCDC178 has garnered attention due to its involvement in cancer biology, particularly in gastric adenocarcinoma, where its mutations and expression levels are linked to patient prognosis and survival outcomes (Elizazu2024Identification; Zhang2021A). The protein's interaction with BRCA1-associated protein 2 (BRAP2) and its role in the ERK signaling pathway further underscore its significance in oncogenic pathways (Zhang2021A). As research progresses, CCDC178 continues to be a focal point for understanding its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CCDC178 gene have been associated with various cancers, particularly gastric adenocarcinoma. Studies have shown that CCDC178 mutations are significantly linked to poor survival outcomes in gastric adenocarcinoma patients. This gene is part of a four-gene-based risk score used to predict survival in gastric cancer, highlighting its clinical significance in prognostic assessments (Zhang2021A). The gene is also associated with BRCA1-associated protein 2 (BRAP2), a negative regulator of the ERK pathway, and its deficiency can impair ERK activation, which is relevant in cancer progression (Zhang2021A).

In addition to gastric cancer, CCDC178 has been implicated in other cancer types. Its expression is linked to poor prognosis in bladder urothelial carcinoma and thyroid carcinoma, as well as reduced overall survival and disease-free survival in gastric cancer patients (Elizazu2024Identification). The gene's expression is often downregulated in several types of carcinoma compared to adjacent non-cancerous tissues, suggesting its potential role as a biomarker for cancer prognosis and as a target for precision medicine (Zhang2021A).
