# KPRP

## Overview
Keratinocyte proline-rich protein (KPRP) is encoded by the KPRP gene located on chromosome 1q21. This protein is predominantly expressed in the upper granular layer of the epidermis and plays a crucial role in the differentiation and function of keratinocytes, which are the primary cell type in the epidermis. KPRP is integral to the formation of the cornified envelope (CE), a vital component of the skin's protective barrier, contributing to the structural integrity and resilience of the skin. Characterized by a high proline content and multiple putative N-myristoylation sites, KPRP is involved in various biological pathways, including signal transduction and apoptosis. Its expression pattern and functional similarities to other CE proteins, such as loricrin, suggest that KPRP is a significant component of the CE, participating in its assembly and cross-linking processes (Karim2019Human; Lee2005Molecular).

## Structure
The human keratinocyte proline-rich protein (hKPRP) is encoded by a gene located on chromosome 1q21. The protein is composed of 579 amino acids, with a molecular mass of approximately 64 kDa and an isoelectric point of 8.72 (Lee2005Molecular). hKPRP is characterized by a high proline content, constituting 18% of its amino acid composition, which may influence its structural properties (Lee2005Molecular).

The primary structure of hKPRP includes eight putative N-myristoylation sites, which are important for its role in various biological pathways such as signal transduction and apoptosis (Lee2005Molecular). The protein also contains a glutamine-rich region spanning amino acids 4-209 and a proline-rich region from amino acids 257-510 (Lee2005Molecular). These regions suggest potential interactions with transglutaminases, possibly linking hKPRP to the cornified envelope (CE) in keratinocytes (Lee2005Molecular).

While specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of hKPRP are not provided, the protein's expression pattern and localization in the uppermost part of the granular layer of the epidermis suggest its involvement in keratinocyte differentiation and cornified envelope formation (Lee2005Molecular).

## Function
The keratinocyte proline-rich protein (KPRP) plays a significant role in the differentiation and function of keratinocytes, which are the predominant cell type in the epidermis. KPRP is involved in the formation of the cornified envelope (CE), a critical component of the skin's protective barrier. This protein is expressed in the upper granular layer of the epidermis and is associated with the process of keratinization, contributing to the structural integrity and resilience of the skin (Lee2005Molecular).

KPRP is characterized by a high proline content and contains multiple putative N-myristoylation sites, which are important for its role in biological pathways such as signal transduction and apoptosis (Lee2005Molecular). The protein's expression pattern is similar to that of loricrin, another well-known CE protein, suggesting that KPRP may be a component of the CE and play a role in its assembly (Lee2005Molecular).

In healthy human cells, KPRP is primarily active in the stratum granulosum of the epidermis, where it contributes to the formation of the skin barrier by participating in the cross-linking of proteins within the cornified envelope (Edqvist2014Expression; Karim2019Human).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
Keratinocyte proline-rich protein (KPRP) is involved in the formation of the cornified envelope (CE) in the epidermis, a structure critical for skin barrier function. KPRP is characterized by a high proline content and a relatively low net charge per residue, which may influence its interactions with other proteins. Although KPRP itself has a lower innate potential for liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), it may act as a 'client' protein, colocalizing with other CE proteins that are more likely to drive LLPS, such as involucrin, periplakin, and envoplakin (Samulevich2022Thermostable).

In the context of the cornified envelope, KPRP is incorporated into isopeptide structures, contributing to the protective barrier of the epidermis. This incorporation suggests that KPRP interacts with other proteins within the envelope, although specific interaction partners are not detailed (Karim2019Human). The presence of KPRP in the envelope fraction, with a higher relative amount compared to the solubilized fraction, indicates its significant role in the structural integrity of the CE (Karim2019Human). These interactions are crucial for maintaining the resilience and functionality of the skin barrier.
