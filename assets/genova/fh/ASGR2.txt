# ASGR2

## Overview
ASGR2, or asialoglycoprotein receptor 2, is a gene that encodes a type II transmembrane protein involved in the clearance of glycoproteins from the bloodstream. The protein, asialoglycoprotein receptor 2, is primarily expressed in liver cells, particularly hepatocytes, where it plays a critical role in maintaining serum glycoprotein homeostasis by recognizing and facilitating the endocytosis of glycoproteins with terminal galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine residues. ASGR2 forms hetero-oligomeric complexes with ASGR1, another subunit of the asialoglycoprotein receptor, to execute its function. Beyond its hepatic role, ASGR2 is also expressed in peripheral blood monocytes, suggesting additional roles in immune function. The receptor's activity is significant in modulating blood coagulation and thrombosis, with implications in conditions such as sepsis (Grewal2008The; Harris2012ASGR1andASGR2; Xu2024Serum).

## Structure
The ASGR2 protein is a type II transmembrane protein involved in the clearance of glycoproteins from the bloodstream. It features a cytoplasmic domain, a transmembrane domain, and an extracellular carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) (Harris2012ASGR1andASGR2). The CRD is composed of six β-strands flanked by two α-helices, with three calcium ions crucial for structural stability (Sampathkumar2024Targeted). The primary structure of ASGR2 includes a signal peptide, transmembrane domain, and cytoplasmic tail. The secondary structure is characterized by alpha helices and beta sheets, while the tertiary structure is stabilized by disulfide bonds. ASGR2 can form hetero-oligomeric complexes with ASGR1, representing its quaternary structure (Grewal2008The).

ASGR2 gives rise to five transcripts encoding four isoforms (a to d) due to alternative exon splicing. Isoforms a and c contain a proteolysis cleavage signal, allowing the CRD to be secreted as a soluble protein, while isoforms b and d remain membrane-bound (Harris2012ASGR1andASGR2). Common post-translational modifications include glycosylation, which is typical for proteins involved in glycoprotein binding and clearance.

## Function
ASGR2, a component of the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR), is primarily expressed in liver cells, particularly hepatocytes, where it plays a crucial role in the clearance of glycoproteins from the bloodstream. This receptor specifically recognizes glycoproteins with terminal galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine residues, facilitating their endocytosis and degradation. This process is essential for maintaining serum glycoprotein homeostasis and liver function (Grewal2008The; Xu2024Serum).

In addition to its hepatic expression, ASGR2 is also found in peripheral blood monocytes, albeit at lower levels. This suggests a potential role in immune function, possibly by providing a mobile pool of the receptor that can reach sites remote from the liver (Harris2012ASGR1andASGR2). ASGR2 is involved in the clearance of desialylated platelets, which is important in managing thrombocytopenia during infections (Grewal2008The).

ASGR2's function extends to modulating blood coagulation and thrombosis by interacting with components like von Willebrand factor (vWF) and platelets (Grewal2008The). The receptor's activity is crucial in mitigating the lethal coagulopathy associated with sepsis, highlighting its importance in both normal physiology and disease contexts (Grewal2008The).

## Interactions
ASGR2, a subunit of the asialoglycoprotein receptor, primarily interacts with ASGR1 to form a receptor complex involved in the clearance of glycoproteins from the bloodstream. This complex facilitates the endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of glycoproteins lacking terminal sialic acid residues (Xu2024Serum). ASGR2 can form homodimers or heterodimers with ASGR1, and this interaction is significant in modulating low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) levels. Overexpression of ASGR1 and ASGR2 in certain cell lines results in a decrease in LDLR levels, suggesting that these proteins can independently reduce LDLR levels, likely as homo- or hetero-oligomers (SusanResiga2021Asialoglycoprotein; SusanResiga2021Asialoglycoproteina).

ASGR2 also interacts with specific antibodies, such as the 8G8 antibody, which binds to both ASGR1 and ASGR2. This interaction does not cause significant conformational changes in ASGR2, and the binding sites are distinct from the glycoprotein-binding site on the receptor (Sampathkumar2024Targeted). These interactions highlight ASGR2's role in various cellular processes and its potential implications in diseases such as chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension and gastric cancer (Xu2024Serum; Tanaka2018PatternSpecific).
