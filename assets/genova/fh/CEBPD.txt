# CEBPD

## Overview
CEBPD, or CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein delta, is a gene that encodes a transcription factor belonging to the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein family. This protein is characterized by a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain, which is crucial for its role in DNA binding and dimerization, allowing it to regulate gene expression. CEBPD is involved in various biological processes, including inflammation, immune responses, and cell differentiation. It is typically expressed at low levels but can be rapidly induced by external stimuli such as cytokines and growth factors. The protein plays a significant role in the regulation of pro-inflammatory mediators and interacts with other proteins and nucleic acids to influence cellular processes. CEBPD's involvement in disease contexts, such as cancer and inflammatory conditions, highlights its dual role as both a tumor suppressor and promoter, depending on the cellular environment (Spek2021CEBPD; Balamurugan2013The; Ko2015Biological).

## Structure
The CEBPD protein is a member of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein family and functions as a transcription factor. It is composed of 269 amino acids and features a highly conserved basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain, which is essential for DNA binding and dimerization (Greene2023Targeting; Ko2015Biological). The leucine zipper domain is characterized by leucine residues at every seventh position, forming coiled heptad repeats that facilitate homo- or heterodimerization, crucial for its transcriptional activity (Greene2023Targeting).

Post-translational modifications such as acetylation, sumoylation, and phosphorylation play significant roles in modulating CEBPD's function and interactions with other proteins, affecting its ability to recognize DNA sequences and perform diverse cellular functions (Ko2015Biological). These modifications are particularly important in the context of inflammation and COX-2 regulation (Ko2015Biological).

While the context does not provide specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of CEBPD, it highlights the importance of the bZIP domain and post-translational modifications in its functional regulation. There is no mention of splice variant isoforms in the provided context.

## Function
The CEBPD gene encodes a transcription factor that is part of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein family, which plays a significant role in regulating various biological processes, including inflammation, immune responses, and cell differentiation. CEBPD is typically expressed at low levels under normal physiological conditions but can be rapidly induced by external stimuli such as glucocorticoids, insulin, and growth factors (Ko2015Biological). In inflammatory environments, CEBPD is activated by factors like interleukin-6, lipopolysaccharides, and tumor necrosis factor-α, and it is involved in the regulation of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), an enzyme important in immune responses (Ko2015Biological).

CEBPD is known to enhance the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as IL-1β, COX-2, TNFα, and IL-6, and is involved in various inflammatory processes both in vitro and in vivo (Spek2021CEBPD). It interacts with NF-κB in inflamed and immune cells, playing a role in the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines and influencing the inflammatory response's duration (Ko2015Biological). CEBPD also plays a role in macrophage polarization during inflammation, suggesting its involvement in both initiating and resolving inflammatory responses (Ko2015Biological).

## Clinical Significance
The CEBPD gene plays a complex role in various diseases, particularly cancer and inflammatory conditions. In cancer, CEBPD functions as both a tumor suppressor and promoter, depending on the context. In breast cancer, CEBPD mRNA is downregulated as the disease progresses, suggesting a tumor-suppressor role, although its protein expression correlates with proliferation markers (Balamurugan2013The). In glioblastoma, CEBPD is overexpressed, correlating with poor prognosis due to its role in promoting HIF-1α expression and inhibiting the tumor suppressor FBXW7α (Mao2023CEBPD; Balamurugan2013The). In urothelial carcinoma, CEBPD overexpression is linked to poor prognosis and is driven by gene amplification, contributing to aggressive cancer phenotypes through interactions with MYC and VEGFA (Chan2022Angiogenesis; Chan2023The).

In inflammatory responses, CEBPD is involved in both promoting and inhibiting inflammation. It can activate anti-inflammatory pathways by inducing PPARγ expression, but sumoylated CEBPD can inhibit PPARγ, potentially increasing inflammation (Balamurugan2013The). CEBPD is also implicated in sterile inflammation, contributing to conditions like Alzheimer's disease and rheumatoid arthritis by promoting inflammatory cytokine expression (Balamurugan2013The).

## Interactions
CEBPD (CCAAT enhancer binding protein delta) is involved in several physical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. CEBPD forms a complex with the epigenetic reader BRD4, which is crucial for the transcriptional regulation of its own gene and other target genes. This interaction involves the binding of CEBPD and BRD4 to the CEBPD promoter and enhancer regions, a process that is disrupted by the BRD4 bromodomain blocker JQ1 (Wang2020Partnership; Wang2021A). The partnership between CEBPD and BRD4 is essential for the inflammatory state transition of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs), particularly in response to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) stimulation, which upregulates both proteins (Wang2021A).

In glioblastoma, CEBPD interacts with the extracellular matrix (ECM) and integrin-mediated pathways, influencing the EGFR/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. CEBPD binds to the promoter regions of ECM proteins like FN1, regulating their expression and contributing to glioma cell invasiveness under hypoxic conditions (Mao2023CEBPD). These interactions highlight CEBPD's role in both transcriptional regulation and cellular signaling pathways.
