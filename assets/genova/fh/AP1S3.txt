# AP1S3

## Overview
The AP1S3 gene encodes the adaptor-related protein complex 1 subunit sigma 3, a critical component of the adaptor protein complex 1 (AP-1). This protein is involved in the intracellular trafficking of proteins, particularly in the transport of transmembrane proteins between the trans-Golgi network and endosomes via clathrin-coated vesicles. As a small subunit of the AP-1 complex, it plays a vital role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and immune function, particularly through its involvement in autophagy and cytokine regulation. Mutations in AP1S3 have been implicated in various autoinflammatory skin disorders, such as pustular psoriasis, and are associated with dysregulated immune responses. The gene's significance extends to potential links with psoriatic arthritis, highlighting its broader role in autoinflammatory conditions (Atschekzei2022Identification; SettaKaffetzi2014AP1S3; Mahil2016AP1S3).

## Function
The AP1S3 gene encodes the σ1C subunit of the adaptor protein complex 1 (AP-1), which is crucial for vesicular trafficking between the trans-Golgi network and endosomes. This process is essential for the transport of transmembrane proteins to specific target organelles, facilitated by the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles (SettaKaffetzi2014AP1S3). The AP-1 complex is a heterotetramer composed of two large, one medium, and one small subunit, with the small subunit being encoded by AP1S3 (Mahil2016AP1S3).

In healthy human cells, AP1S3 is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper immune function. It plays a significant role in autophagy, a catabolic process that degrades damaged cellular components, which is crucial for cellular homeostasis. AP1S3 deficiency impairs autophagy in keratinocytes, leading to abnormal accumulation of the p62 protein and enhanced NF-κB signaling, which increases the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Mahil2016AP1S3). Additionally, AP1S3 is involved in the trafficking of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR-3) to the endosome, which is essential for normal downstream signaling and immune response regulation (SettaKaffetzi2014AP1S3). The gene's role in autophagy and cytokine regulation underscores its importance in maintaining normal immune function in keratinocytes (Mahil2016AP1S3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AP1S3 gene are significantly associated with pustular psoriasis, a severe autoinflammatory skin disorder. Two specific mutations, c.11T>G (p.Phe4Cys) and c.97C>T (p.Arg33Trp), have been identified as pathogenic, leading to impaired vesicular trafficking and Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR-3) homeostasis (SettaKaffetzi2014AP1S3). These mutations result in loss-of-function changes that disrupt the formation of functional AP-1 complexes, affecting protein stability and interactions (Mahil2016AP1S3).

AP1S3 mutations are linked to various forms of pustular psoriasis, including generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP), palmar plantar pustulosis (PPP), and acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau (ACH) (Mahil2016AP1S3). The mutations lead to abnormal immune responses, characterized by increased IL-36α production and enhanced NF-κB signaling, contributing to skin autoinflammation (Akiyama2020Autoinflammatory; Mahil2016AP1S3).

In addition to skin disorders, AP1S3 variants have been associated with psoriatic arthritis, suggesting a broader role in autoinflammatory conditions. These variants are more frequent in patients with both pustular psoriasis and arthritis, indicating a potential link between AP1S3 mutations and joint inflammation (Atschekzei2022Identification).
