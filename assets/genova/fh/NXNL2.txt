# NXNL2

## Overview
NXNL2 is a gene that encodes the protein nucleoredoxin like 2, which plays a pivotal role in redox regulation and cellular signaling. This protein is characterized by a thioredoxin-like domain, which is essential for its function in oxidative stress defense and cellular homeostasis (AïtAli2022Thea; Gellert2019Substrate). Nucleoredoxin like 2 is primarily localized in the cytosol and is involved in inhibiting TAU phosphorylation, a process significant for neuronal health and linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (IdelfonsoGarcía2022Is; AïtAli2022Thea). The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in various isoforms that contribute to its diverse functional roles in tissues like the retina and brain, where it is crucial for vision and olfactory functions (AïtAli2022Thea; Lambard2010Expression). The protein's involvement in protecting photoreceptor cells and its regulatory role in oxidative stress responses underscore its importance in maintaining sensory and cognitive functions.

## Structure
The NXNL2 gene encodes a protein that is involved in redox regulation and cellular signaling. The protein is characterized by a thioredoxin-like domain, which is common among redox-active proteins and is crucial for its function in oxidative stress defense (AïtAli2022Thea; Gellert2019Substrate). The active site of the NXNL2 protein is identified as CAPS, and it is localized in the cytosol (Gellert2019Substrate). 

NXNL2 is known to produce a thioredoxin-like protein that inhibits TAU phosphorylation, which is significant for maintaining neuronal health and is linked to conditions such as tauopathies and Alzheimer's disease (IdelfonsoGarcía2022Is; AïtAli2022Thea). The protein's structure may include specific domains that facilitate its interaction with other cellular components, although detailed 3-D structural data is not provided in the available context (Gellert2019Substrate).

The NXNL2 gene also undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that may have distinct functional roles in various tissues, including the retina and brain (AïtAli2022Thea; Lambard2010Expression). These isoforms contribute to the gene's involvement in vision and olfactory functions, as well as its protective role against neurodegenerative diseases (AïtAli2022Thea).

## Function
NXNL2 (nucleoredoxin like 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in redox regulation and cellular homeostasis, playing a crucial role in protecting photoreceptor cells in the retina. The protein is active in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, where it participates in oxidative stress response and cellular signaling pathways. In the retina, NXNL2 is expressed in photoreceptors with cilia, and its expression is regulated by cis elements such as the CRX binding element in mice, which controls its expression in photoreceptors (AïtAli2022The).

NXNL2 produces a trophic factor, RdCVF2, through intron retention. RdCVF2 is a thioredoxin-like protein that inhibits TAU phosphorylation, which is induced by light damage. This function is crucial for maintaining photoreceptor integrity and protecting them from oxidative damage (AïtAli2022The). The enzymatic activity of thioredoxins like RdCVFL, a product of NXNL genes, is essential for reducing oxidized cysteines, thereby protecting photoreceptors from oxidative damage (AïtAli2022The).

The absence of NXNL2 in mice leads to progressive vision and olfaction dysfunction, as well as memory deficits that progress to tauopathy, reminiscent of Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal sensory and cognitive functions (AïtAli2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the NXNL2 gene have been linked to several neurodegenerative diseases, particularly affecting the retina and brain. In the retina, NXNL2 is crucial for the survival and maintenance of photoreceptor cells. Its absence leads to conditions such as retinitis pigmentosa, characterized by the degeneration of rod and cone photoreceptors, resulting in severe visual impairment (Lambard2010Expression; Jaillard2012Nxnl2). The gene's product, RdCVF2, provides trophic support to cone photoreceptors, and its deficiency causes cone degeneration and visual performance decline (Jaillard2012Nxnl2).

In the brain, NXNL2 is implicated in cognitive functions and its disruption is associated with Alzheimer's disease. Nxnl2 knockout mice exhibit severe behavioral deficiencies, including issues with learning, memory, and coordination, as well as signs of tauopathy, such as TAU protein hyperphosphorylation, which are closely linked to Alzheimer's disease progression (IdelfonsoGarcía2022Is). The gene's involvement in oxidative stress responses and its interaction with TAU protein suggest a protective role against neurodegeneration (Jaillard2012Nxnl2). These findings indicate that NXNL2 plays a significant role in maintaining neuronal health and its dysfunction can lead to neurodegenerative conditions.

## Interactions
NXNL2, a gene encoding a protein involved in cellular redox regulation, participates in several interactions that are crucial for its function. The protein product of NXNL2, known as RdCVF2, is involved in metabolic signaling between rod and cone photoreceptors. It is produced through intron retention and functions as a thioredoxin-like protein that inhibits TAU phosphorylation induced by light damage (AïtAli2022Thea). 

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, the inactivation of the Nxnl2 gene leads to stress and Tau hyperphosphorylation, which are key features of the disease. This suggests that NXNL2 may interact with proteins involved in Tau regulation, although specific protein interactions are not detailed (IdelfonsoGarcía2022Is). 

NXNL2 is also expressed in the brain, where it may have a distinct receptor from BSG1, suggesting potential crosstalk between RdCVF and RdCVF2 receptors. This is supported by comparative genomic analysis, indicating variations in the BSG gene across species (AïtAli2022Thea). 

The expression of NXNL2 is regulated by a CRX binding element, a cis-regulatory element, which is crucial for its expression in photoreceptors (AïtAli2022Thea).
