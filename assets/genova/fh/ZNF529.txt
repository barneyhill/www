# ZNF529

## Overview
ZNF529 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 529, which is part of the zinc finger protein family known for their role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which facilitate their interaction with DNA, RNA, or other proteins. The zinc finger protein 529 is implicated in various biological processes, including gene expression regulation and cellular differentiation. While the specific functions of ZNF529 are still being elucidated, it has been associated with significant clinical implications, particularly in cardiovascular health and cancer. The gene's variants, such as the ZNF529:p.K405X, have been linked to altered lipid metabolism and potential therapeutic applications in reducing cardiovascular disease risk (Nielsen2020Lossoffunction; Nielsen2019Lossoffunction). Additionally, the long non-coding RNA ZNF529-AS1, related to the ZNF529 gene, has been identified as a prognostic marker in hepatocellular carcinoma, highlighting its role in cancer biology (Ma2023LincRNA).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ZNF529 gene have been associated with various clinical implications, particularly in the context of cardiovascular health and cancer. The ZNF529:p.K405X variant is a loss-of-function mutation linked to decreased levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the blood. This variant has been identified in Norwegian populations and is associated with a 25% reduction in LDL-C levels, comparable to the effects of statin treatment. This reduction in LDL-C is achieved without affecting liver enzymes or non-fasting blood glucose, suggesting that the variant does not cause liver damage. The ZNF529 gene is considered a potential therapeutic target for reducing blood lipids and cardiovascular disease risk without liver-damaging side effects (Rom2021Genetic; Nielsen2020Lossoffunction; Nielsen2019Lossoffunction).

In cancer, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the long non-coding RNA ZNF529-AS1, which is associated with the ZNF529 gene, is differentially expressed. High expression levels of ZNF529-AS1 are linked to poor prognosis in HCC patients and are associated with various clinicopathological characteristics, including tumor stage and immune cell infiltration. ZNF529-AS1 may serve as a prognostic marker and is involved in the tumor microenvironment, potentially influencing immune response and drug sensitivity (Ma2023LincRNA).
