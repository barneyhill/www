# SSR3

## Overview
The SSR3 gene encodes the signal sequence receptor subunit 3, a critical component of the translocon-associated protein (TRAP) complex, which is integral to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane receptor and plays a pivotal role in the translocation and glycosylation of nascent polypeptides, facilitating their proper folding and function. The TRAP complex, comprising SSR1, SSR2, SSR3, and SSR4, is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis, particularly under conditions of ER stress, by enhancing N-linked glycosylation and interacting with the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex (Phoomak2021The; Ng2019Mutations). Mutations in SSR3 are associated with congenital disorders of glycosylation, leading to severe developmental and neurological impairments, while its dysregulation is implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma, highlighting its significance in both genetic disorders and cancer (Ondruskova2021Congenital; Liu2023SSR3).

## Structure
The SSR3 gene encodes a subunit of the translocon-associated protein (TRAP) complex, which is integral to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. The TRAP complex is a hetero-tetramer composed of SSR1, SSR2, SSR3, and SSR4, and plays a crucial role in protein translocation and N-linked glycosylation (Gemmer2020A; Phoomak2021The). SSR3, specifically, is involved in maintaining the stability and function of the TRAP complex, which is essential for the proper glycosylation of proteins (Ng2019Mutations).

The molecular structure of SSR3 includes transmembrane alpha helices, as part of the TRAP complex, which interacts with the Sec61 translocon and the ribosome during protein biogenesis in the ER (Jaskolowski2022Molecular). The TRAP complex, including SSR3, forms a cradle-like domain that contacts the Sec translocon, facilitating co-translational insertion and translocation of proteins (Jaskolowski2022Molecular).

Post-translational modifications of SSR3 are regulated by the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2J1, which is involved in enhancing glycoprotein ER-associated degradation and ensuring proper N-glycosylation during ER stress (Phoomak2021The). This regulation highlights the dynamic role of SSR3 in maintaining protein homeostasis under stress conditions.

## Function
The SSR3 gene encodes a subunit of the translocon-associated protein (TRAP) complex, which is integral to the translocation of nascent polypeptides across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This complex is essential for the proper glycosylation of proteins, a critical post-translational modification that affects protein folding, stability, and function (Ng2019Mutations). SSR3, as part of the TRAP complex, enhances the efficiency of N-linked glycosylation by facilitating the transfer of oligosaccharides to nascent proteins, thereby maintaining the stability of the TRAP complex and ensuring proper glycosylation processes in healthy human cells (Ng2019Mutations).

In the context of ER stress, SSR3 plays a crucial role in regulating N-glycosylation. It is involved in maintaining glycosylation homeostasis by increasing its association with the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, which is vital for N-glycosylation during stress conditions (Phoomak2021The). SSR3 is also posttranslationally regulated by the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2J1, which suggests a mechanism that coordinates N-glycosylation with ER-associated degradation, ensuring proper protein folding and ER homeostasis (Phoomak2021The). This regulation is crucial for maintaining cellular function and stability, particularly under conditions of ER stress (Phoomak2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SSR3 gene are linked to a novel congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG), characterized by severe developmental and neurological impairments. A specific homozygous INDEL variant, c.278_281delAGGA [p.Glu93Valfs*7], has been identified in a patient with this disorder. This mutation results in the complete loss of the SSR3 protein and a substantial reduction in SSR1 and SSR4 proteins, destabilizing the translocon-associated protein (TRAP) complex. The instability of the TRAP complex impairs N-linked glycosylation, as evidenced by abnormal glycosylation of marker proteins such as GP130 and ICAM1 (Ondruskova2021Congenital; Ng2019Mutations).

Clinically, individuals with SSR3 mutations present with a range of symptoms, including severe intellectual and developmental disabilities, sensorineural deafness, skeletal deformities, and recurrent infections. These symptoms align with the typical profile of CDG type I disorders (Ondruskova2021Congenital; Ng2019Mutations).

In addition to its role in congenital disorders, SSR3 expression is implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). SSR3 is often upregulated in HCC tissues, and its co-expression with SEC61G is associated with increased cell proliferation and poorer prognosis in patients, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis (Liu2023SSR3).

## Interactions
SSR3, also known as TRAPG, is a component of the translocon-associated protein (TRAP) complex, which plays a crucial role in protein translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. SSR3 interacts with other subunits of the TRAP complex, including SSR1, SSR2, and SSR4, to facilitate the translocation and proper folding of nascent polypeptides (Phoomak2021The). During ER stress, SSR3 and SSR4 are involved in preventing the association of SSR1 and SSR2 with BiP, an ER stress-induced chaperone, thereby maintaining N-glycosylation (Phoomak2021The). 

SSR3 is also regulated posttranslationally by the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2J1, which mediates its degradation. This regulation is crucial for maintaining proper N-glycosylation by enhancing glycoprotein ER-associated degradation (ERAD) and facilitating SSR3's interaction with the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, specifically the RPN1 subunit (Phoomak2021The). The interaction between SSR3 and the OST complex ensures proper N-glycosylation of newly synthesized proteins under ER stress conditions (Phoomak2021The). These interactions highlight SSR3's role in the quality control of glycoproteins and its involvement in cellular homeostasis during stress conditions.
