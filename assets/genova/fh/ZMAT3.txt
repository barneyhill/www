# ZMAT3

## Overview
ZMAT3 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger matrin-type 3 protein, an RNA-binding protein primarily involved in the regulation of RNA splicing. This protein plays a crucial role in the p53 tumor suppression pathway by influencing the splicing and stability of RNA transcripts, particularly those associated with tumor suppression and cellular adhesion. ZMAT3 is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it binds to specific RNA sequences, modulating RNA processing and stability. Its activity is largely independent of its expression levels, suggesting a robust regulatory function across various cellular conditions. The protein's interactions with RNA are critical for maintaining RNA homeostasis and proper splicing, which are essential for normal cellular processes and the regulation of oncogenic pathways (Muys2020The; BiegingRolett2020Zmat3).

## Function
ZMAT3 is a zinc finger matrin-type 3 gene that encodes an RNA-binding protein involved in the regulation of RNA splicing, particularly within the p53 tumor suppression program. In healthy human cells, ZMAT3 plays a crucial role in maintaining RNA homeostasis by binding to RNA transcripts and influencing their splicing and stability. It is known to bind near the 3' splice sites and branch points of transcripts, affecting the splicing of various genes, including those involved in p53 regulation, such as Mdm4 and Mdm2, as well as genes related to cellular adhesion and cytoskeletal function (BiegingRolett2020Zmat3).

ZMAT3 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it modulates RNA levels by binding to 3' UTRs and regulating splicing. It preferentially binds to introns flanking premature termination codon-containing exons, stabilizing mRNAs and influencing gene expression programs (BiegingRolett2020Zmat3). The protein's activity is largely independent of its expression levels, as demonstrated by its consistent binding profile in various experimental conditions (Muys2020The).

ZMAT3's function in healthy cells involves maintaining RNA stability and proper splicing, contributing to normal cellular processes and the regulation of the p53 pathway (BiegingRolett2020Zmat3).

## Clinical Significance
ZMAT3, a gene regulated by the tumor suppressor p53, plays a significant role in cancer development when its expression or function is altered. In colorectal carcinoma (CRC), ZMAT3 acts as a splicing regulator, inhibiting the formation of oncogenic CD44 variants. Alterations in ZMAT3 expression lead to increased levels of these variants, which are associated with enhanced tumorigenesis and poor prognosis in CRC (Muys2020The). The loss of ZMAT3 or its interaction with p53 results in a shift towards oncogenic CD44 isoforms, contributing to cancer progression (Muys2020The).

In the context of the p53 tumor suppression network, ZMAT3 is identified as a critical component, accounting for a significant portion of p53's tumor suppressor activity. Its loss leads to increased cell migration and proliferation, similar to p53 deficiency, indicating its cooperative role with other genes like CDKN1A (p21) in restricting cancer-associated phenotypes (Boutelle2024Integrative). Despite its significant role in tumor suppression, ZMAT3 loss does not appear to accelerate tumorigenesis in certain models, such as c-MYC-driven lymphoma and Kras G12D-driven lung adenocarcinoma, suggesting its effects may be context-dependent (Best2020Consequences).

## Interactions
ZMAT3, a p53-induced RNA-binding protein, is involved in several interactions with nucleic acids and proteins, playing a significant role in post-transcriptional regulation. It binds to thousands of precursor mRNA molecules, particularly at uridine-rich sequences, and is involved in the regulation of splicing. This binding is enriched in intronic regions near 3' splice sites, suggesting that ZMAT3 interacts with nascent transcripts and may influence splicing by modulating RNA processing or stability (Muys2020The).

ZMAT3 is known to inhibit the splicing of oncogenic CD44 variants by binding to polypyrimidine tracts in pre-mRNA introns, which are crucial for 3' splice site definition. This interaction suggests that ZMAT3 may act as a splicing suppressor by competing with the splicing machinery, thereby preventing the formation of defective mRNA isoforms (Muys2020The).

The protein predominantly localizes to the nucleus, particularly in nuclear speckles, which are compartments enriched with splicing factors. This localization supports its role in splicing regulation and its interaction with other splicing-related proteins (Muys2020The). ZMAT3's interactions are largely independent of its expression levels, as indicated by consistent binding profiles across different conditions (Muys2020The).
