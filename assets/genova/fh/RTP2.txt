# RTP2

## Overview
RTP2, or receptor transporter protein 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the trafficking and functional expression of odorant receptors (ORs) within olfactory sensory neurons. The RTP2 protein is categorized as a transporter protein, primarily functioning within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus. It plays a critical role in the proper folding, maturation, and transport of ORs, facilitating their movement from the ER to the Golgi. Although RTP2 has a limited effect on promoting OR cell surface expression compared to its homolog RTP1S, it is essential for maintaining the balance of OR expression and ensuring the stability of OR gene choice. The absence of RTP2 can lead to significant downregulation of ORs, defects in OR trafficking, and a reduction in mature olfactory sensory neurons, ultimately affecting olfactory capacity (Sharma2017Olfactory; Yu2017Receptortransporting).

## Function
RTP2 (receptor transporter protein 2) plays a crucial role in the trafficking and functional expression of odorant receptors (ORs) in olfactory sensory neurons. It is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus, where it assists in the proper folding and maturation of these receptors. RTP2 facilitates the transport of ORs from the ER to the Golgi, although it has a limited effect on promoting their cell surface expression compared to RTP1S. In some cases, RTP2 can even suppress the function of RTP1S, indicating a regulatory role in OR trafficking (Yu2017Receptortransporting).

RTP2 is essential for maintaining the balance of OR expression and ensuring the stability of OR gene choice. In the absence of RTP2, as observed in RTP1,2 double knockout mice, there is a significant downregulation of ORs, leading to defects in OR trafficking and a reduction in mature olfactory sensory neurons. This results in diminished olfactory capacity and altered OR gene choice, with some ORs being overrepresented and others underrepresented (Sharma2017Olfactory). RTP2's role in OR trafficking and gene choice is crucial for the proper functioning of the olfactory system and the stabilization of OR expression in olfactory sensory neurons.

## Interactions
RTP2 (receptor transporter protein 2) is involved in the trafficking and functional expression of odorant receptors (ORs) by interacting with other proteins. RTP2 can form homodimers, although with lower efficiency compared to RTP1S, and can also form heteromers with other RTP family proteins, indicating its role in multiprotein complexes (Fukutani2019The). RTP2 interacts with RTP1S, and this interaction can affect the trafficking of ORs. When co-expressed, RTP2 can suppress the effect of RTP1S, retaining more OR proteins in the Golgi apparatus and affecting their transport to the cell surface (Yu2017Receptortransporting).

RTP2's interactions with ORs and RTP1S suggest a competitive dynamic, where RTP2 may modulate OR responses through orthosteric or allosteric mechanisms (Yu2017Receptortransporting). These interactions are crucial for the regulation of OR trafficking and expression, as RTP2 can increase the detection threshold for certain ORs, indicating a suppressive role in OR function (Yu2017Receptortransporting). RTP2's involvement in these interactions highlights its regulatory function in the olfactory system, influencing receptor signaling pathways and potentially interacting with other proteins involved in receptor trafficking.
