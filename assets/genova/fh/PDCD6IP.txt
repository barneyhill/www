# PDCD6IP

## Overview
PDCD6IP, also known as programmed cell death 6 interacting protein or ALIX, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional adaptor protein involved in various cellular processes, including endosomal sorting, apoptosis, and membrane repair. The protein ALIX is characterized by its boomerang shape and contains distinct structural domains such as the Bro1 domain, V domain, and a proline-rich region, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and cellular components. ALIX plays a critical role in endocytosis, cytoskeleton and membrane remodeling, and extracellular vesicle biogenesis. It interacts with several key proteins, including ESCRT-III components and the ATG12-ATG3 conjugate, which are essential for its function in membrane remodeling and autophagy. The protein's activity and localization are modulated by post-translational modifications, such as S-palmitoylation, which influence its dimerization and interaction with tetraspanin proteins like CD9. PDCD6IP has been implicated in various diseases, including neurodevelopmental disorders and cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Romancino2018Palmitoylation; Larios2020ALIX; Murrow2015ATG12–ATG3).

## Structure
PDCD6IP, also known as Alix, is a protein involved in endosomal sorting and apoptosis. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the PDCD6IP gene. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets. The tertiary structure features a Bro1 domain, V domain, and proline-rich region, which facilitate protein-protein interactions. Alix can form homodimers, indicating a quaternary structure. It undergoes post-translational modifications like phosphorylation and ubiquitination, and has splice variant isoforms that may affect its function.

Alix is a multifunctional adaptor protein with a boomerang shape, characterized by a convex face known as the BRO1 domain, which includes a positively charged surface that may function as a membrane bending domain (Romancino2018Palmitoylation). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including endocytosis, cytoskeleton and membrane remodeling, and extracellular vesicle (EV) biogenesis (Romancino2018Palmitoylation). Alix interacts with tetraspanin proteins, such as CD9, and its function is modulated by S-palmitoylation, a reversible lipid post-translational modification (Romancino2018Palmitoylation). This modification affects Alix's dimerization and membrane localization, as well as its interaction with other proteins (Romancino2018Palmitoylation). The palmitoylation of Alix is crucial for its role in the structural organization of exosome-like vesicle membranes (Romancino2018Palmitoylation).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PDCD6IP gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of cerebral palsy (CP), a deletion in the PDCD6IP gene has been identified as pathogenic. This deletion was associated with downregulation of PDCD6IP expression and was supported by a zebrafish model, which exhibited significant motor control issues and morphological defects, suggesting a role in neurodevelopmental disorders (Corbett2018Pathogenic). The gene's involvement in CP is further supported by findings in mouse models, where the absence of Pdcd6ip led to neurological abnormalities such as hydrocephalus and cortical thinning (Corbett2018Pathogenic).

In cancer research, PDCD6IP has been associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A 15-bp insertion/deletion polymorphism in the promoter region of PDCD6IP was linked to increased HCC risk, with the insertion allele enhancing transcriptional activity and gene expression in HCC cell lines (Yu2013A). Additionally, PDCD6IP has been identified as a potential urinary biomarker for upper gastrointestinal cancers, with upregulation observed in cancer patients, indicating its role in cancer progression (Husi2015Programmed). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PDCD6IP in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
PDCD6IP, also known as ALIX, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. ALIX interacts with ESCRT-III components, such as CHMP4B, through its BRO1 domain, facilitating their recruitment to endosomal membranes. This interaction is essential for membrane remodeling processes (Larios2020ALIX). ALIX also interacts with the ATG12-ATG3 conjugate, which is important for basal autophagy and endolysosomal trafficking. The interaction involves the Bro1 and V domains of PDCD6IP, enhancing its binding to YPXnL-containing effectors (Murrow2015ATG12–ATG3).

In the context of muscle cell membrane repair, PDCD6IP interacts with PDCD6 (ALG-2), which is released from annexin-A2 upon calcium elevation. This release allows PDCD6 to bind with PDCD6IP, facilitating a repair mechanism involving annexin-A2 and dysferlin (Drescher2023Analysis). The interaction between ALG-2 and ALIX is calcium-dependent, requiring Ca2+ binding to specific EF-hand motifs in ALG-2. This interaction is crucial for the structural changes necessary for ALG-2 to bind with ALIX, influencing apoptosis and endosomal sorting pathways (Subramanian2004Ca2+).
