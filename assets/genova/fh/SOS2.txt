# SOS2

## Overview
The SOS2 gene encodes the SOS Ras/Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 2, a critical protein involved in cellular signaling pathways. As a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), the SOS2 protein facilitates the activation of RAS and RAC proteins, which are pivotal in regulating various cellular processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and survival. The protein is characterized by several domains, including a kinase catalytic domain, a regulatory domain with a protein phosphatase interaction motif, and domains involved in membrane attachment and guanine nucleotide exchange. These structural features enable SOS2 to participate in the RAS-PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, influencing cell motility and cytoskeleton reorganization. SOS2 is particularly significant in maintaining epidermal stem cell populations and is implicated in the pathogenesis of Noonan syndrome and certain cancers due to its role in the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway (Baltanás2021SOS2; Lissewski2020Variants; Baltanás2020SOS).

## Structure
The SOS2 protein, also known as SOS Ras/Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 2, is involved in cellular signaling pathways. It contains several key domains that contribute to its function. The N-terminal region includes a kinase catalytic domain similar to SNF1/AMPK, which is involved in its activation under stress conditions (Ohta2003A). The C-terminal region features a regulatory domain that includes a protein phosphatase interaction (PPI) motif, crucial for interaction with protein phosphatase 2C ABI2 (Ohta2003A). This motif is conserved across the SOS2 family and is essential for its regulatory interactions (Ohta2003A).

The SOS2 protein also contains a Dbl homology (DH) domain and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which are involved in the activation of RAS and RAC proteins (Baltanás2021SOS2). These domains are responsible for modulating SOS GEF auto-inhibition and membrane attachment (Baltanás2020SOS). The protein's structure is further characterized by a REM (Ras exchanger motif) domain, which facilitates guanine nucleotide exchange on RAS targets (Baltanás2021SOS2).

SOS2 can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may affect its interaction capabilities and regulatory functions (Baltanás2020SOS). The protein may also undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions.

## Function
The SOS2 gene encodes a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that plays a crucial role in activating RAS and RAC proteins, which are essential for various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, SOS2 is involved in the RAS-PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is vital for cell survival, cytoskeleton reorganization, and cell motility. This pathway is particularly important in cells with mutant RAS, where SOS2 promotes EGF-stimulated AKT phosphorylation, contributing to cell proliferation and survival (Baltanás2021SOS2).

SOS2 is also implicated in maintaining epidermal stem cell populations and overall epidermal homeostasis. It has a specific role in the regulation of keratinocyte behavior, influencing processes such as migration and development. While SOS1 and SOS2 have overlapping functions, SOS2 is more involved in the PI3K signaling axis, whereas SOS1 is more associated with the ERK signaling axis (Baltanás2021Functional).

In terms of cellular localization, SOS2 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane, where it facilitates the exchange of GDP for GTP on RAS proteins. This activity is essential for transmitting signals from cell surface receptors to intracellular pathways, influencing cell growth, differentiation, and survival (Baltanás2020SOS).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SOS2 gene are associated with Noonan syndrome (NS), a genetic disorder characterized by distinctive facial features, heart defects, and other physical abnormalities. SOS2 variants are a rare cause of NS, accounting for less than 2% of cases. These mutations often lead to gain of function in the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway, similar to other NS-related genes. Patients with SOS2-related NS frequently exhibit ectodermal abnormalities and cardiovascular issues, with a notable predisposition for lymphatic complications, which can significantly impact morbidity and mortality (Gentile2021First; Lissewski2020Variants).

Prenatal features of NS with SOS2 mutations include increased nuchal translucency, polyhydramnios, and nuchal edema. These features highlight the importance of early diagnosis for genetic counseling (Gentile2021First). The SOS2 gene is also implicated in certain cancers, although it is less frequently associated with sporadic tumors compared to SOS1. SOS2 mutations have been detected in gallbladder carcinoma and desmoplastic melanomas, which often lack typical BRAF or NRAS mutations but show frequent activating mutations in components of the RAS-ERK pathways, including SOS2 (Baltanás2020SOS).
