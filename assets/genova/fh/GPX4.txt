# GPX4

## Overview
The GPX4 gene encodes glutathione peroxidase 4, a selenoprotein that plays a pivotal role in cellular antioxidant defense mechanisms. As a member of the glutathione peroxidase family, GPX4 is unique due to its ability to reduce phospholipid hydroperoxides within cellular membranes, thereby preventing lipid peroxidation and maintaining membrane integrity (Seibt2019Role; Seiler2008Glutathione). The protein is categorized as an antioxidant enzyme and is essential for protecting cells from oxidative damage, contributing to cellular homeostasis and survival (Maiorino2018GPx4). GPX4 is expressed in multiple isoforms, including mitochondrial, nuclear, and cytosolic forms, each with distinct cellular localizations and functions (Pei2023Research; Cozza2017Glutathione). The gene's significance extends to its involvement in various biological processes and its association with several clinical conditions, including Sedaghatian-type spondylometaphyseal dysplasia and susceptibility to ferroptosis-related diseases (Weaver2022The; Forcina2019GPX4).

## Structure
Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) is a monomeric enzyme with a molecular weight of approximately 19-22 kDa, depending on the isoform (Imai2003Biological). The primary structure of GPX4 includes a sequence of 170 amino acids, featuring a crucial selenocysteine residue at its active site, which is essential for its catalytic activity (Imai2003Biological). This selenocysteine is incorporated via a selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) element in its mRNA (Imai2003Biological).

GPX4 exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, including mitochondrial (mGPX4), nuclear (nGPX4), and cytosolic (cGPX4) forms, each with distinct localization and functions (Pei2023Research; Cozza2017Glutathione). The mitochondrial form is targeted to mitochondria, while the nuclear and cytosolic forms are found in the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, and cytosol (Imai2003Biological).

The enzyme's tertiary structure involves a catalytically active tetrad, including selenocysteine, glutamine, tryptophan, and asparagine, which is crucial for its function (Janowski2016Crystal). GPX4's interaction with membrane phospholipids is facilitated by a cationic surface near its catalytic center, allowing it to bind to the polar head of phospholipids through electrostatic interactions (Cozza2017Glutathione).

## Function
Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) is a crucial enzyme in cellular antioxidant defense, primarily involved in reducing lipid hydroperoxides to their corresponding alcohols, thereby preventing lipid peroxidation and maintaining membrane integrity (Seibt2019Role; Seiler2008Glutathione). This activity is essential for protecting cells from oxidative damage and is vital for cellular homeostasis and survival (Maiorino2018GPx4). GPX4 is unique among glutathione peroxidases due to its ability to reduce phospholipid hydroperoxides in membranes, which is critical in preventing oxidative stress-induced cell death pathways, such as ferroptosis (Seibt2019Role; Seiler2008Glutathione).

In healthy cells, GPX4 acts as a redox sensor and regulator, modulating the activity of lipoxygenases and cyclooxygenases, particularly 12/15-lipoxygenase, to prevent detrimental lipid peroxidation (Seiler2008Glutathione). The enzyme's activity is linked to the availability of glutathione (GSH), a critical antioxidant that helps maintain cellular redox balance (Maiorino2018GPx4). GPX4 is active in various cellular compartments, including the cytosol and mitochondria, and is essential for normal development, as evidenced by the early embryonic lethality observed in GPX4-deficient mice (Seiler2008Glutathione; Maiorino2018GPx4).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GPX4 gene are linked to several severe conditions, most notably Sedaghatian-type spondylometaphyseal dysplasia (SSMD), a rare neonatal lethal disorder. SSMD is characterized by skeletal dysplasia, cardiac arrhythmia, and brain anomalies, often leading to death shortly after birth. Specific mutations, such as the R152H missense mutation and frameshift variants like c.153_160del, result in a significant loss of GPX4 enzymatic activity, which is central to the clinical phenotypes observed in SSMD patients (Liu2021Characterization; Weaver2022The; Fedida2020Sedaghatiantype).

GPX4 is also implicated in ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death associated with lipid peroxidation. Alterations in GPX4 expression or function can increase susceptibility to ferroptosis, contributing to various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders like Huntington's, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's diseases, as well as ischemia-reperfusion injury and acute kidney injury (Forcina2019GPX4; Ingold2018Selenium).

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in GPX4, such as rs713041, have been associated with increased risks of colorectal cancer, stroke, and hypertension, while potentially decreasing the risk of pre-eclampsia. These SNPs may influence GPX4 levels and function, affecting oxidative stress and disease susceptibility (Barbosa2022The).

## Interactions
GPX4, or glutathione peroxidase 4, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function and regulation. It interacts with the adaptor protein 14-3-3ε, which is essential for its inactivation by the ferroptosis-inducing molecule RSL3. This interaction facilitates the alkylation of the catalytic selenocysteine in GPX4, leading to its inactivation, and is independent of the presence of RSL3, indicating a stable binding between GPX4 and 14-3-3ε (Vučković2019Inactivation).

GPX4 also interacts with proteins such as MAPK13 and PRDX6, which are involved in cellular signaling pathways. The protein-protein interaction network of GPX4 includes novel interactors like APBA3, EGR4, FUT5, GAMT, GTF2F1, MATK, and ZNF197, which have been experimentally validated. These interactions are linked to various biological processes, including oxidant detoxification and epithelial morphogenesis, and are relevant to disorders such as Sedaghatian Type Spondylometaphyseal Dysplasia (Karunakaran2022GPX4associated).

Additionally, GPX4 is part of a complex network involving ciliary proteins, with TERF1 being closely interconnected through several intermediate interactors. These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of GPX4 in cellular processes and its potential implications in developmental disorders (Karunakaran2022GPX4associated).
