# POLDIP3

## Overview
POLDIP3, or polymerase δ-interacting protein 3, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in both DNA and RNA metabolism. The protein, also referred to as DNA polymerase delta interacting protein 3, is characterized by its AlkB homolog 2 PCNA-Interacting motif (APIM) and RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains, which facilitate its interactions with DNA polymerase δ and ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), respectively (Huang2022The). POLDIP3 plays a critical role in DNA replication and repair, contributing to genomic stability by preventing R-loop formation and assisting in chromatin loading during replication stress (Björkman2020Human; Huang2022The). Additionally, as a component of the human transcription-export (TREX) complex, POLDIP3 is essential for mRNA processing and export, influencing translation efficiency and cellular stress responses (Singh2022POLDIP3:; Folco2012The). Its involvement in these processes underscores its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and genomic integrity.

## Structure
POLDIP3, also known as polymerase δ-interacting protein 3, is a protein with a molecular weight of approximately 42 kD. It is primarily located in the nucleus and at the exon junction complex (EJC), but in mitotic cells, it is found in the cytoplasm (Huang2022The). The protein contains two main domains: an AlkB homolog 2 PCNA-Interacting motif (APIM) domain and an RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain. The APIM domain, located at residues 53-125, allows POLDIP3 to interact with DNA polymerase δ and PCNA, playing a crucial role in DNA replication (Huang2022The). The RRM domain, spanning residues 277-357, is involved in RNA processing and can bind with ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) (Huang2022The).

POLDIP3 is also part of the human transcription-export (TREX) complex, which is essential for mRNA nuclear export (Huang2022The). The protein undergoes phosphorylation, which enhances its interactions with eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (EIF4G), forming a complex that promotes mRNA translation of interferon-stimulated genes (Huang2022The). Splice variants of POLDIP3 can result in different isoforms, potentially affecting its interaction with other proteins and RNA (Huang2022The).

## Function
POLDIP3, also known as DNA polymerase delta interacting protein 3, plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability and facilitating DNA replication and repair processes in healthy human cells. It interacts with DNA polymerase delta (Pol δ) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) to promote both leading-strand and lagging-strand DNA synthesis, helping Pol δ overcome secondary structure obstacles and preventing R-loop formation (Huang2022The; Singh2022POLDIP3:). POLDIP3 is also involved in the chromatin loading of proteins in response to replication stress, particularly in association with RTEL1, a helicase involved in DNA repair (Björkman2020Human).

In addition to its role in DNA metabolism, POLDIP3 is a component of the TREX complex, which is involved in mRNA processing and export. It interacts with the exon junction complex (EJC) and influences mRNA translation efficiency by interacting with ribosomal protein S6K1 (Singh2022POLDIP3:; Folco2012The). POLDIP3's RNA recognition motif (RRM) suggests its involvement in RNA processing, further highlighting its role in cellular homeostasis and stress responses (Huang2022The). These functions underscore POLDIP3's importance in regulating both RNA and DNA metabolism, contributing to the maintenance of genomic integrity and proper cellular function.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the POLDIP3 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In cancer, POLDIP3 is involved in maintaining genomic stability by preventing R-loop accumulation, which can lead to replication stress and genomic instability. The loss of POLDIP3, along with RTEL1, results in increased R-loop levels, particularly at common fragile sites, contributing to chromosomal instability and potentially promoting cancer progression (Björkman2020Human).

In the context of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), POLDIP3 splicing is altered due to the dysfunction of TDP-43, a protein involved in RNA metabolism. This alteration leads to an increase in POLDIP3 variant-2 mRNA levels in ALS-affected tissues, suggesting a link between POLDIP3 splicing changes and ALS pathogenesis (Shiga2012Alteration).

POLDIP3 also plays a role in antiviral responses. During porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) infection, POLDIP3 is cleaved by the viral nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5), reducing its expression and facilitating viral replication. This mechanism is conserved across other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, indicating that POLDIP3 is a target for viral strategies to evade host immune responses (Wu2023Broad).

## Interactions
POLDIP3, also known as DNA polymerase delta interacting protein 3, engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in both RNA and DNA metabolism. It is a component of the human transcription-export (TREX) complex, where it associates with proteins such as THOC2, UAP56, and Aly in an ATP-dependent manner, facilitating mRNA export (Folco2012The). POLDIP3 also interacts with the p50 subunit of DNA polymerase δ, contributing to DNA replication and repair processes (Smyk2006Human; Singh2022POLDIP3:).

The protein is known to bind with ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), enhancing mRNA translation efficiency. This interaction is regulated by phosphorylation at specific serine residues (Huang2022The; Singh2022POLDIP3:). POLDIP3 also forms a complex with eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (EIF4G) in an IFN-α-dependent manner, promoting the translation of interferon-stimulated genes (Huang2022The).

POLDIP3 interacts with the enhancer of rudimentary homolog (ERH), a transcription regulator, and this interaction is crucial for regulating cell growth (Smyk2006Human; Huang2022The). Additionally, POLDIP3 is involved in resolving R-loops and maintaining genomic stability through its interaction with RTEL1, a DNA helicase (Björkman2020Human; Singh2022POLDIP3:).
