# ST3GAL6

## Overview
ST3GAL6 is a gene that encodes the enzyme ST3 beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase 6, a member of the sialyltransferase family. This enzyme is responsible for the transfer of sialic acid to galactose-containing substrates, forming sialylated glycoproteins and glycolipids, which are crucial for various cellular functions, including cell-cell interactions, signaling, and immune responses (Dalangood2020Identification). The enzyme is primarily active in the Golgi apparatus, where it influences cell adhesion and migration by modifying the sialylation patterns of glycoproteins and glycolipids (Dalangood2020Identification). ST3GAL6 plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity and functional properties of cell membranes and extracellular matrices, which are essential for normal cellular communication and tissue homeostasis (Dalangood2020Identification). Alterations in the expression of ST3GAL6 have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer, where it affects key signaling pathways and cellular processes (Li2022Comprehensive).

## Structure
The ST3GAL6 gene encodes the enzyme ST3 beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase 6, which is involved in the sialylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids. The enzyme is a member of the ST3GAL family, which catalyzes the formation of α2,3-linkages between sialic acid (Neu5Ac) and terminal galactose residues on glycoproteins and glycolipids (HarduinLepers2023The). 

The primary structure of ST3GAL6 includes specific sialylmotifs, which are conserved peptide motifs involved in donor and acceptor binding. In ST3Gal VI, sialylmotif L is located between residues 116 and 162, sialylmotif S between 257 and 281, motif III between 290 and 293, and motif VS between 307 and 312 (Uslupehlivan2019Computational). These motifs are part of the Rossmann-fold scaffold, which assembles a metal-independent CMP-Neu5Ac binding site (HarduinLepers2023The).

The tertiary structure of ST3GAL6 involves the 3D folding of these motifs, with the CMP ligand binding site located at Lys 303 on the coil region, interacting electrostatically with the ligand (Uslupehlivan2019Computational). Post-translational modifications include N-glycosylation at Asn 181, which interacts electrostatically with Asp 140, Val 141, and Thr 162 on the L motif, affecting the enzyme's function (Uslupehlivan2019Computational).

## Function
ST3GAL6 encodes an enzyme that is part of the sialyl-transferase family, which is responsible for the transfer of sialic acid to galactose-containing substrates, forming sialylated glycoproteins and glycolipids. This enzymatic activity is crucial for the biosynthesis of sialylated glycoconjugates, which play significant roles in cell-cell interactions, signaling, and immune responses (Dalangood2020Identification). The enzyme is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it influences cell adhesion and migration by modifying the sialylation patterns of glycoproteins and glycolipids (Dalangood2020Identification).

In healthy human cells, the sialylation process mediated by ST3GAL6 affects protein conformation and interactions, which are essential for various cellular functions, including cell survival, proliferation, migration, and invasion (Dalangood2020Identification). The enzyme's activity is particularly important in maintaining the structural integrity and functional properties of cell membranes and extracellular matrices, which are critical for normal cellular communication and tissue homeostasis (Dalangood2020Identification). Through these molecular processes, ST3GAL6 contributes to the regulation of physiological processes such as immune response and cellular signaling pathways, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ST3GAL6 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), ST3GAL6 expression is frequently downregulated, which is associated with advanced disease stages and poor clinical outcomes. This downregulation is linked to increased cell invasiveness through the EGFR/MAPK signaling pathway, promoting the expression of matrix metalloproteinases MMP2 and MMP9, which are crucial for cancer cell invasion (Li2022Comprehensive). Low ST3GAL6 expression is also associated with poor prognosis in LUAD patients, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Li2022Comprehensive).

In urinary bladder cancer (UBC), increased expression of ST3GAL6 correlates with higher tumor stages and grades, as well as poor survival outcomes. ST3GAL6 is involved in cell invasion and migration, and its expression is negatively regulated by the transcription factor GATA3. Knockdown of ST3GAL6 in UBC cell lines results in decreased cell invasion and migration, indicating its role in tumor progression (Dalangood2020Identification).

ST3GAL6 is also involved in neurological diseases, where its silencing affects autophagy regulation, potentially impacting conditions like hepatic encephalopathy and neurodegenerative diseases (Li2024Sialyltransferase).

## Interactions
ST3GAL6, a sialyltransferase, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with the HSPB8-BAG3 complex, playing a role in regulating autophagy. Silencing ST3GAL6 reduces the expression of this complex, which is crucial for autophagy regulation (Li2024Sialyltransferase). ST3GAL6 also affects the sialylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is involved in several signaling pathways, including PI3K/AKT, influencing autophagy and other cellular functions (Li2024Sialyltransferase).

In the context of cancer, ST3GAL6 interacts with proteins involved in the EGFR signaling pathway, such as in lung adenocarcinoma, where its deficiency can be partially reversed by the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib (Li2022Comprehensive). In urinary bladder cancer, ST3GAL6 affects the α2,3-sialylation levels of EGFR, impacting key signaling pathways like RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK, PI3K-AKT, and JAK-STAT, which are crucial for cell survival, proliferation, migration, and invasion (Dalangood2020Identification).

ST3GAL6 is also regulated by the long non-coding RNA ST3GAL6-AS1, which influences its expression and activity in various cancers, including colorectal cancer and multiple myeloma, by interacting with proteins like hnRNPA2B1 (Hu2019LncRNA; Shen2021lncRNA).
