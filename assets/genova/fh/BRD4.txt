# BRD4

## Overview
BRD4, or Bromodomain Containing 4, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family, which plays a pivotal role in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling. The BRD4 protein is characterized by the presence of two N-terminal bromodomains and an extraterminal (ET) domain, which facilitate its binding to acetylated histones and interaction with various transcriptional regulators. This binding capability allows BRD4 to remain associated with chromatin throughout the cell cycle, distinguishing it from other bromodomain proteins that dissociate during mitosis (Dey2003The; Jang2005The). Functionally, BRD4 is involved in the regulation of gene expression by interacting with the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) and other transcriptional complexes, thereby influencing processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and response to inflammatory stimuli (Wang2012Bromodomain; Dey2019BRD4). The gene's dysregulation is implicated in various diseases, including cancer and Cornelia de Lange syndrome, highlighting its significance as a potential therapeutic target (DrumondBock2021The; Olley2018BRD4).

## Structure
BRD4 is a member of the BET protein family, characterized by two N-terminal bromodomains and an extraterminal (ET) domain. The primary structure of the BRD4-ET domain consists of 83 residues, corresponding to residues 601-683 of the full-length mouse BRD4 protein (Lin2008Solution). The secondary structure of the ET domain includes three alpha-helices: α1 (Tyr613-Lys625), α2 (Lys630-Arg641), and α3 (Thr664-Leu676), with α2 being antiparallel to α1 and α3 (Lin2008Solution). The tertiary structure features a well-defined loop region between α2 and α3, contributing to a hydrophobic core and forming two adjacent pockets for potential protein-protein interactions (Lin2008Solution).

The ET domain does not self-associate, indicating it exists as a monomer in solution (Lin2008Solution). The BRD4 protein can undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which may influence its function. BRD4 has two isoforms, with the longer variant containing a C-terminal motif that interacts with pTEFb to activate RNA polymerase II (Crowe2016Structure). The structural features of BRD4, including its bromodomains and ET domain, facilitate its role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation.

## Function
BRD4 is a member of the BET family of proteins and plays a crucial role in regulating transcription and maintaining chromatin structure in healthy human cells. It binds to acetylated histones through its double bromodomains, which allows it to remain associated with chromatin during both interphase and mitosis, unlike many other bromodomain proteins that are displaced during cell division (Dey2003The; Jang2005The). This binding is essential for the maintenance of higher-order chromatin structure, as BRD4 promotes nucleosome-nucleosome interactions and chromatin fiber oligomerization, contributing to chromatin compaction (Wang2012Bromodomain).

BRD4 also interacts with the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), facilitating the transition from transcription initiation to elongation by phosphorylating the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II (Jang2005The). It acts as a coactivator in the transcriptional activation of NF-κB target genes by binding to acetylated RelA, a subunit of NF-κB, and enhancing transcriptional activity (Huang2009Brd4). BRD4's role in transcription regulation and chromatin structure maintenance is vital for processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and response to inflammatory stimuli (Wang2012Bromodomain; Dey2019BRD4).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the BRD4 gene are implicated in several diseases and conditions. In high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC), BRD4 is often amplified, leading to increased gene and protein expression. This amplification is associated with advanced-stage cancer, poor prognosis, and chemoresistance. BRD4 amplification frequently co-occurs with cyclin E1 (CCNE1) amplification, contributing to worse survival outcomes and genomic instability (DrumondBock2021The). 

BRD4 mutations are also linked to Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) and CdLS-like disorders. De novo mutations in BRD4, such as a heterozygous deletion and missense mutations, have been identified in individuals with CdLS-like symptoms. These mutations suggest that BRD4 haploinsufficiency is a likely genetic mechanism for the CdLS-like phenotype (Olley2018BRD4).

In cancer, BRD4 dysregulation contributes to aberrant chromatin remodeling and gene transcription, promoting tumorigenesis. BRD4 gene rearrangements and mutations, such as missense and nonsense substitutions, have been documented in various cancers, enhancing cell invasion and migration (White2019Emerging). BRD4 is also involved in the regulation of inflammatory processes and tumor initiation, linking chronic inflammation to cancer progression (White2019Emerging).

## Interactions
BRD4, a member of the BET family, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in transcriptional regulation. It interacts with the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), a complex composed of CDK9 and cyclin T1, through its C-terminal domain (CTD). This interaction is essential for the recruitment of P-TEFb to the HIV promoter by the viral transactivator Tat, facilitating transcriptional elongation (Bisgrove2007Conserved). BRD4 can inhibit the Tat-P-TEFb interaction, thereby suppressing HIV transcription (Bisgrove2007Conserved).

The ET domain of BRD4 serves as a recruitment platform for various proteins, including NSD3, JMJD6, CHD4, GLTSCR1, and ATAD5, forming distinct multiprotein complexes (Rahman2011The). These interactions are significant for transcriptional activation independent of P-TEFb, with NSD3 and JMJD6 being recruited to regulated genes in a BRD4-dependent manner (Rahman2011The). The ET domain also interacts with the C-terminal motif from murine leukemia virus integrase, forming a structured intermolecular β sheet crucial for viral integration into host chromatin (Crowe2016Structure).

BRD4's interactions extend to viral proteins, such as the HPV E2 protein, suggesting a role in tethering viral genomes to host chromatin (Bisgrove2007Conserved). These interactions highlight BRD4's multifaceted role in transcriptional regulation and its potential as a therapeutic target.
