# TPSG1

## Overview
TPSG1 is a gene that encodes the protein tryptase gamma 1, a member of the serine protease family predominantly expressed in mast cells. Tryptase gamma 1 is involved in various physiological processes, including the degradation of extracellular matrix components and the activation of other proteases, which are crucial for tissue remodeling and immune defense mechanisms (Hansbro2014Importance). Unlike other tryptases, tryptase gamma 1 does not form tetramers and exhibits unique substrate preferences, which may define its specific roles in cellular processes (Atiakshin2018Tryptase). The protein is expressed at lower levels compared to other tryptases and is localized to the plasma membrane or secretory granule membrane of mast cells, where it plays a significant role in immune responses, particularly in inflammation and allergic reactions (Atiakshin2018Tryptase). Its activity is linked to both beneficial and adverse effects on lung function and inflammatory diseases, highlighting its potential involvement in the regulation of inflammatory pathways and tissue homeostasis (Hansbro2014Importance).

## Function
The TPSG1 gene encodes tryptase gamma 1, a serine protease primarily expressed in mast cells. This enzyme is involved in various molecular processes, including the degradation of extracellular matrix components and the activation of other proteases, contributing to tissue remodeling and defense mechanisms (Hansbro2014Importance). Unlike other tryptases, γ-tryptase does not form tetramers to achieve physiological activity and has distinct substrate preferences, which may influence its specific roles in cellular processes (Atiakshin2018Tryptase).

In healthy human cells, TPSG1 is expressed at low levels compared to other tryptases, such as β-tryptases, and is localized to the plasma membrane or secretory granule membrane of mast cells (Atiakshin2018Tryptase). It plays a role in immune responses, particularly in inflammation and allergic reactions, by participating in the activation of protease-activated receptors and influencing connective tissue remodeling through the activation of matrix metalloproteinases (Hansbro2014Importance). The enzyme's activity is associated with both beneficial and adverse effects on lung function and inflammatory diseases, suggesting its involvement in the regulation of inflammatory pathways and tissue homeostasis (Hansbro2014Importance).
