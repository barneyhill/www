# DDX20

## Overview
DDX20 is a gene that encodes the protein DEAD-box helicase 20, a member of the DEAD-box family of RNA helicases. This family is characterized by the conserved Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD) motif, which is crucial for ATP-dependent RNA unwinding activities. The DDX20 protein plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including RNA metabolism, translation initiation, and the assembly of ribosomes and spliceosomes. It is a core component of the survival motor neuron (SMN) complex, essential for the biogenesis of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), and is involved in microRNA maturation and gene expression regulation. DDX20 also influences several signaling pathways, such as the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and p53 pathways, impacting tumorigenesis and viral replication. The gene's expression is observed in various tissues, contributing to early embryonic development and central nervous system functions (Hobani2022Genetic; He2023DDX20:).

## Structure
The DDX20 protein, also known as DEAD-box helicase 20, is characterized by a conserved Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD) motif, which is primarily found in the highly conserved motif II. The molecular structure of DDX20 includes a conserved core domain at the N-terminal end, comprising two recombinase A (RecA)-like structural domains. This core domain contains nine conserved motifs: Q, I, Ia, Ib, II, III, IV, V, and VI, which are involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis, RNA substrate binding, and regulating decapping enzyme activity (Curmi2018The; He2023DDX20:).

The C-terminal region of DDX20 is necessary for maintaining its uncoupling helicase activity and is highly divergent between species, serving as an interaction site for accessory factors (Curmi2018The; He2023DDX20:). DDX20 is part of the SMN complex, interacting with SMN proteins and other Gemin proteins, which is crucial for the assembly of spliceosomal small ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) (Curmi2018The; He2023DDX20:).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, sumoylation, and acetylation influence the localization and function of DDX20 (He2023DDX20:). The protein has multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with four protein-coding isoforms identified (Hobani2022Genetic).

## Function
DDX20, also known as DEAD-box helicase 20, is a multifunctional protein involved in various molecular processes in healthy human cells. It is a member of the DEAD-box family of RNA helicases, characterized by the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD), and functions primarily as an RNA-unwinding enzyme. DDX20 plays a crucial role in RNA metabolism, including translation initiation, nuclear and mitochondrial splicing, and the assembly of ribosomes and spliceosomes (Hobani2022Genetic; He2023DDX20:).

DDX20 is a component of the survival motor neuron (SMN) complex, which is essential for the biogenesis and assembly of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), critical for pre-mRNA splicing (Hobani2022Genetic; He2023DDX20:). It also participates in microRNA (miRNA) maturation by forming a complex with Argonaute proteins to facilitate the formation of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), thereby regulating gene expression through mRNA degradation or inhibition (Hobani2022Genetic).

In addition to its role in RNA processing, DDX20 influences several signaling pathways, including the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and p53 pathways, impacting processes such as tumorigenesis and viral replication (He2023DDX20:). It is expressed in various tissues, including the testis, and is involved in early embryonic development, ovarian morphology, and function, as well as the differentiation of oligodendrocytes and maintenance of myelin gene expression in the central nervous system (He2023DDX20:).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the DDX20 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In colorectal cancer, a common missense mutation, rs197412, is associated with increased risk and recurrence. This polymorphism results in an isoleucine to threonine substitution, which may affect substrate binding and regulatory motifs in tissues (Hobani2022Genetic). DDX20 is significantly overexpressed in colon adenocarcinoma, and its expression levels correlate with survival outcomes, although not with chemotherapy response (Hobani2022Genetic).

In liver cancer, specifically hepatocellular carcinoma, DDX20 acts as a tumor suppressor by regulating miRNAs that inhibit NF-κB activity, thus reducing inflammation and tumorigenesis (He2023DDX20:). Conversely, in breast and prostate cancers, DDX20 functions as an oncogene, enhancing tumor growth and metastasis through the NF-κB signaling pathway (He2023DDX20:). The gene's role in cancer is complex, as it can both suppress and promote tumorigenesis depending on the context (He2023DDX20:).

DDX20 is also linked to neurological disorders, such as spinal muscular atrophy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, where its depletion is a common feature (Curmi2018The). These associations highlight the gene's significant role in disease pathogenesis.

## Interactions
DDX20, also known as Gemin3, is a multifunctional protein that participates in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It is a core component of the survival motor neuron (SMN) complex, which is essential for the assembly of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) involved in RNA splicing. DDX20 interacts with SMN proteins and other Gemin proteins, such as Gemin2, 4, and 5, to stabilize the SMN complex, facilitating the assembly of snRNPs by binding to small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) (Curmi2018The; He2023DDX20:).

DDX20 also interacts with various transcription factors, including the nuclear receptor steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), where it enhances SF-1 sumoylation, suppressing its transcriptional activity. It engages with the Forkhead transcription factor FOXL2, promoting FOXL2-mediated ovarian cell death, and interacts with the mitotic Ets transcription inhibitor (PE-1/METS), recruiting histone deacetylases HDAC-2 and HDAC5 to target specific promoters (He2023DDX20:).

In the context of viral infections, DDX20 binds to Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigens EBNA2 and EBNA3C, affecting the spliceosome complex and p53-mediated transcriptional activity, respectively. It also interacts with the HIV-1 coprotein Vpr, leading to its degradation (He2023DDX20:). These interactions highlight DDX20's role in transcription regulation, viral replication, and innate immunity.
