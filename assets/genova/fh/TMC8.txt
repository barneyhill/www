# TMC8

## Overview
TMC8, also known as the transmembrane channel-like 8 gene, encodes a protein that is part of the transmembrane channel-like (TMC) family, which is characterized by its role in ion transport and cellular signaling. The TMC8 protein, also referred to as EVER2, is predominantly expressed in lymphoid tissues and plays a crucial role in immune system function, particularly in maintaining zinc homeostasis within lymphocytes. This protein is involved in several immune-associated pathways and is essential for the regulation of immune responses, including those against human papillomavirus (HPV) infections. TMC8 forms a heterodimeric complex with TMC6, which is vital for its stability and function. Mutations in the TMC8 gene are linked to epidermodysplasia verruciformis, a condition that increases susceptibility to HPV and related skin cancers. Additionally, TMC8 expression has been associated with various cancers, where it may play a protective role against tumor development (Wu2020Expression; Lin2021Comprehensive; Castro2011Contribution).

## Function
TMC8, also known as transmembrane channel-like 8, is a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the immune system. It is primarily expressed in lymphoid tissues such as the thymus, lung, and spleen, and is highly present in peripheral lymphocytes, including CD4 and CD8 T cells and B cells (Wu2020Expression). TMC8 plays a significant role in immune cell infiltration and is associated with several immune-associated pathways, including the 'T cell receptor signaling pathway' and 'cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction' (Lin2021Comprehensive). 

The protein is involved in maintaining lymphocyte zinc homeostasis, which is crucial for T cell activation and proliferation. Mutations in TMC8 can lead to zinc ion excess, affecting these processes (Lin2021Comprehensive). TMC8 is also linked to the regulation of immune responses against human papillomavirus (HPV), suggesting its role in antiviral defense mechanisms (Lin2021Comprehensive). 

In terms of cellular localization, TMC8 is active in the endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane, contributing to cellular signaling and ion balance. Its expression and function are regulated by interactions with other proteins, such as forming a heterodimeric complex with TMC6, which is important for its stability and function in lymphocytes (Wu2020Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TMC8 gene, also known as EVER2, are clinically significant in several diseases. TMC8 is notably associated with epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV), a rare genetic disorder characterized by an increased susceptibility to human papillomavirus (HPV) infections. This condition often leads to the development of skin lesions and a higher risk of skin squamous cell carcinoma. Mutations in TMC8 can disrupt zinc ion homeostasis, which is crucial for T cell activation and proliferation, thereby impairing the immune response to HPV infections (Lin2021Comprehensive; Wang2021Identification).

In head and neck squamous cancer (HNSC), TMC8 expression is upregulated, which is linked to lower methylation levels in its promoter region. This upregulation is associated with improved prognosis in several cancers, including bladder cancer and cervical squamous cell carcinoma, suggesting a potential protective role against tumor development (Lin2021Comprehensive).

Genetic variations in TMC8 have also been implicated in cervical cancer susceptibility. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TMC8 gene region have been associated with cervical cancer, potentially affecting HPV replication and immune responses (Castro2011Contribution).

## Interactions
TMC8, also known as EVER2, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function. TMC8 forms a heterodimeric complex with TMC6, another member of the TMC family. This interaction is significant in lymphocytes, where TMC6 and TMC8 are highly expressed and co-expressed, suggesting a functional partnership. The TMC6-TMC8 complex stabilizes each protein, preventing proteolysis and promoting their function on the cell surface (Wu2020Expression).

TMC8 also interacts with calcium and integrin-binding protein 1 (CIB1), forming a heterotrimeric complex with TMC6 and CIB1. This complex is important for the stability and function of each component, as it protects CIB1 from ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Conversely, CIB1 is necessary for stabilizing TMC6 and TMC8 levels, indicating a mutual regulatory relationship (Wu2020Expression).

In addition to these interactions, TMC8 is part of a complex with the Zn2+ transporter 1 (ZnT-1) in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. This complex is involved in interactions with the HPV16 E5 protein, which may influence HPV replication by affecting the activity of the Zn-sensoring transcription factor MTF-1 and c-jun (Castro2011Contribution).
