# H2AC1

## Overview
H2AC1 is a gene that encodes the protein H2A clustered histone 1, which is a member of the histone H2A family. Histones are essential nuclear proteins that play a critical role in the organization and regulation of chromatin structure, thereby influencing gene expression and DNA replication processes. The H2A clustered histone 1 protein is involved in the formation of nucleosomes, the fundamental units of chromatin, by wrapping DNA around histone octamers. This process is crucial for the compaction of DNA within the nucleus and for the regulation of access to genetic information. The H2AC1 gene, like other histone genes, is highly conserved and subject to tight regulatory mechanisms to ensure proper chromatin dynamics and cellular function (Qiu2020aarFDC).
