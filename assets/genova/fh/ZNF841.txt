# ZNF841

## Overview
ZNF841 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 841, a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are typically involved in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger proteins play crucial roles in various cellular processes, including development, differentiation, and apoptosis. The ZNF841 protein is implicated in several biological pathways and has been associated with various diseases and conditions, such as pulmonary arterial hypertension, obesity, asthma, and prostate cancer. Its expression and genetic variations can influence disease risk, progression, and treatment response, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (LaulajainenHongisto2020Genomics; Malik2019A; Romanoski2020Transcriptomic; Baya2024Combining).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
ZNF841 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its altered expression levels or genetic variations. In pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), ZNF841 RNA levels are significantly correlated with disease severity. Lower expression of ZNF841 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells is associated with higher pulmonary vascular resistance and brain natriuretic peptide levels, as well as lower tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion and six-minute walk distance results. This suggests that ZNF841 deficiency may contribute to PAH risk and development (Romanoski2020Transcriptomic).

In the context of obesity and fat distribution, ZNF841 has been identified as having male-specific associations with the ratio of android to gynoid tissue fat percentage. However, these associations do not reach significance in sex-combined analyses (Baya2024Combining).

ZNF841 has also been linked to asthma, where specific gene variants are associated with the response to inhaled corticosteroids in asthmatic children. This indicates a potential role for ZNF841 in influencing treatment response in asthma (LaulajainenHongisto2020Genomics).

In prostate cancer, a ZNF841-ZNF432 fusion transcript is noted for its high expression in tumor tissues compared to benign tissues, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis (Malik2019A).
