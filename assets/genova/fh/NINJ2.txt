# NINJ2

## Overview
NINJ2 is a gene that encodes the protein ninjurin 2, a transmembrane protein primarily involved in cell adhesion and nerve regeneration. Ninjurin 2 is characterized by its structural components, including two transmembrane helices and an amphipathic helix, which facilitate its role in cellular adhesion and interaction with lipids and cholesterol within the cell membrane (Sahoo2023How). The protein is expressed in various cell types, including neurons and endothelial cells, where it plays a crucial role in promoting neurite outgrowth and modulating inflammatory responses (Araki2000Ninjurin2; Wang2017NINJ2–). NINJ2 is also implicated in the regulation of immune cell adhesion and migration, particularly in the context of inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis (Sorosina2022Involvement). Genetic variations in the NINJ2 gene have been associated with several clinical conditions, including Alzheimer's disease and ischemic stroke, highlighting its significance in both neurological and vascular health (Wan2011NINJ2; Lin2011Genetic).

## Structure
The NINJ2 protein, encoded by the NINJ2 gene, is a transmembrane protein involved in cell adhesion and nerve regeneration. It shares a high degree of structural similarity with its paralog NINJ1, with both proteins having conserved atomic interactions and similar architectures. NINJ2 consists of a flexible extracellular N-terminal coil, an amphipathic helix, two transmembrane helices, and an extracellular C-terminus. The amphipathic helix is divided into two short helices, AH1 and AH2, with AH2 interacting with the transmembrane helices through hydrophobic interactions (Sahoo2023How).

NINJ2 forms slightly arched bridge-like filaments with two sidewalls of interlinked NINJ2 proteins running in anti-parallel directions, sandwiching two layers of lipids. This structure is influenced by its interaction with cholesterol at the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer, which contributes to the curvature of the NINJ2 filament (Sahoo2023How). The presence of cholesterol-like densities in the inner leaflet suggests a specific interaction that affects the filament's curvature, preventing it from mediating plasma membrane rupture (Sahoo2023How). Despite forming similar linear oligomers as NINJ1, NINJ2's intrinsically curved filament structure limits its functional capabilities in regular cells (Sahoo2023How).

## Function
The NINJ2 gene encodes the protein ninjurin2, which functions as a cell surface adhesion molecule involved in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, ninjurin2 is primarily located on the plasma membrane and is involved in mediating cellular adhesion, particularly through homophilic interactions. This adhesion capability is crucial for promoting neurite outgrowth, which is essential for nerve regeneration and repair (Araki2000Ninjurin2).

Ninjurin2 is expressed in mature sensory and enteric neurons within the peripheral nervous system and is upregulated in Schwann cells following nerve injury, indicating its role in nerve regeneration (Araki2000Ninjurin2). It is also involved in endothelial cell activation and the regulation of inflammatory responses. In endothelial cells, NINJ2 modulates the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and influences the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is a key regulator of inflammation (Noroozi2019A; Wang2017NINJ2–).

NINJ2 is also implicated in the adhesion and migration of immune cells, such as monocytes, to endothelial cells, which is significant in the context of inflammatory processes and diseases like multiple sclerosis (Sorosina2022Involvement; Peroni2019A). These functions highlight the gene's role in maintaining cellular interactions and responses in both the nervous and immune systems.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NINJ2 gene have been associated with several diseases, particularly those involving inflammation and vascular conditions. NINJ2 is implicated in endothelial inflammation and atherosclerosis, where its expression is upregulated in response to inflammatory stimuli like lipopolysaccharides (LPS). This upregulation can lead to increased adhesion of monocytes to endothelial cells, a critical step in the development of atherosclerosis (Wang2017NINJ2–).

Genetic polymorphisms in NINJ2 have been linked to a decreased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Specific haplotypes and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the gene, such as HAP2 (CAGGA), SNP2, and SNP5, are associated with reduced AD risk, potentially by influencing neurite growth and inflammation response (Lin2011Genetic).

NINJ2 polymorphisms are also associated with ischemic stroke risk. In the Chinese Han population, SNP rs10849373 in the NINJ2 gene is linked to an increased risk of ischemic stroke (Wan2011NINJ2). Similarly, the rs3809263 polymorphism is associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) risk, suggesting a role in immune response regulation and nerve regeneration (Noroozi2019A). These findings highlight NINJ2's involvement in various inflammatory and neurological disorders.

## Interactions
NINJ2, also known as ninjurin2, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with the TLR4 receptor, a key player in immune response signaling pathways. This interaction is significant in endothelial activation and inflammation, particularly through the TLR4/NF-κB pathway, which is crucial for the expression of pro-inflammatory genes (Wang2017NINJ2–). NINJ2 also interacts with the transcription factor c-jun, a component of the AP-1 transcription factor, suggesting a regulatory loop that influences endothelial cell activation (Wang2017NINJ2–).

In the context of multiple sclerosis, NINJ2 is implicated in the migration of immune cells across the blood-brain barrier. It acts as a pro-inflammatory mediator, facilitating monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells, which is essential for immune cell migration (Sorosina2022Involvement). The protein's role in inflammation is further supported by its regulation of the NF-κB pathway, where it modulates the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the NF-κB p65 subunit (Wang2017NINJ2–).

NINJ2's interactions are not limited to immune and endothelial cells. It is also expressed in neurons, where it promotes neurite outgrowth through homophilic adhesion, although it does not form heterophilic interactions with Ninjurin1 (Araki2000Ninjurin2).
