# SWT1

## Overview
SWT1 is a gene that encodes the SWT1 RNA endoribonuclease homolog, a protein that plays a pivotal role in RNA processing. This protein is categorized as an endoribonuclease, which is essential for the surveillance and quality control of mRNA within the nucleus. By interacting with the Transcription and Export (TREX) complex and RNA polymerase II, SWT1 ensures the integrity of mRNA transcripts, preventing the export of defective mRNAs to the cytoplasm where they could be translated into malfunctioning proteins (Khowal2021Molecular). The protein's endoribonuclease activity, facilitated by its conserved PIN domain, is crucial for degrading aberrant mRNA transcripts at the nuclear periphery, thus maintaining cellular homeostasis (Skružný2009An). Through its interactions with the TREX-2 complex at the nuclear pore complex, SWT1 is integral to the perinuclear mRNP quality control system, ensuring efficient gene expression and preventing the accumulation of defective mRNAs (Skružný2009An).

## Function
SWT1 (SWT1 RNA endoribonuclease homolog) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in RNA processing, specifically functioning as an endoribonuclease. This protein plays a critical role in mRNA surveillance within the nucleus, ensuring the removal of damaged mRNAs to prevent their transport to the cytoplasm and subsequent translation into defective proteins (Khowal2021Molecular). SWT1 interacts with the Transcription and Export (TREX) complex and RNA polymerase II, which are essential for transcribing messenger RNAs, thereby maintaining efficient gene expression (Khowal2021Molecular).

SWT1 is also linked to the perinuclear mRNP quality control system, where it interacts with the TREX-2 complex involved in transcription-export processes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) (Skružný2009An). The endoribonuclease activity of SWT1, facilitated by its conserved PIN domain, is crucial for degrading defective mRNA transcripts, preventing the export of aberrant mRNPs by degrading defective, pore-trapped pre-mRNPs at the nuclear periphery (Skružný2009An). This function is vital for maintaining proper mRNA processing and export, ensuring cellular homeostasis and preventing the accumulation and leakage of defective mRNAs (Skružný2009An).
