# ADAM28

## Overview
ADAM28 is a gene that encodes the ADAM metallopeptidase domain 28 protein, a member of the ADAM (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase) family. This protein is characterized by its multi-domain structure, which includes a metalloprotease domain, a disintegrin-like domain, and a transmembrane domain, classifying it as a transmembrane protein with enzymatic activity (HOWARD2000Cloning). The ADAM28 protein is involved in various biological processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation, by interacting with integrins and cleaving specific protein substrates (Miyamae2016ADAM28; Bridges2003Integrin). It plays a significant role in maintaining tissue integrity and cellular homeostasis, and its dysregulation is associated with cancer progression and metastasis, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Mochizuki2012Effect; Rudnicka2016Overexpression).

## Structure
ADAM28 is a member of the ADAM (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase) family, characterized by a multi-domain structure. The protein includes a signal sequence, a prodomain, a metalloprotease domain, a disintegrin-like domain, a cysteine-rich region, an EGF-like repeat, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail (HOWARD2000Cloning). The metalloprotease domain contains a catalytic zinc-binding consensus sequence (His-Glu-Xaa-Xaa-His; HEXXH) followed by a Met-turn, a feature of the metzincin family, indicating its catalytic activity (HOWARD2000Cloning; EDWARDS2008The).

The disintegrin domain of ADAM28 is involved in integrin interactions, particularly with integrin α4β1, and features an extended surface with critical charged residues such as Lys 437, Lys 442, and Glu 476, which are essential for cell adhesion (Bridges2003Integrin). The cytoplasmic tail contains proline-rich regions that may interact with proteins containing SH3 domains, suggesting a role in signaling or protein localization (HOWARD2000Cloning).

ADAM28 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different transcript forms that may encode membrane-anchored or secreted variants, affecting its quaternary structure (HOWARD2000Cloning). The protein is expressed in various tissues, with high levels in the epididymis and lower levels in the lung (HOWARD2000Cloning).

## Function
ADAM28, a member of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) family, is involved in several critical biological processes in healthy human cells. It is expressed by epithelial cells in various normal tissues, including the epididymis, bronchus, and stomach, where it plays a protective role against C1q-induced cell death. This protection is achieved by ADAM28 binding to C1q, thereby interfering with its interaction with cell receptors, which can otherwise lead to apoptosis and autophagy in cells with low ADAM28 expression (Miyamae2016ADAM28).

ADAM28 is also implicated in cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation. It is known to digest several protein substrates, including IGFBP-3, CTGF, and von Willebrand factor, and binds to PSGL-1, suggesting a role in modulating cell-cell interactions and maintaining tissue integrity (Miyamae2016ADAM28). In the context of dental tissues, ADAM28 regulates the proliferation and differentiation of human dental papilla mesenchymal cells, indicating its importance in tooth development and morphogenesis (Zhao2008Essential). These functions highlight ADAM28's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and contributing to tissue remodeling in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
ADAM28 is implicated in the pathogenesis of various cancers due to its overexpression and role in promoting tumor growth and metastasis. In breast and non-small cell lung carcinomas, ADAM28 is overexpressed, with its mRNA levels correlating with increased cellular proliferation and metastasis. Serum levels of ADAM28 rise with tumor staging, lymph node metastasis, and carcinoma recurrence in non-small cell lung carcinoma patients (Mochizuki2012Effect). In prostate cancer, ADAM28 overexpression enhances cancer cell proliferation and migration, and its inhibition reduces these processes, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Rudnicka2016Overexpression).

ADAM28 contributes to cancer progression by cleaving substrates such as insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) and von Willebrand factor (VWF). This cleavage enhances the bioavailability of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), promoting cell proliferation and survival, and prevents VWF-induced apoptosis, facilitating metastasis (Mochizuki2012Effect; Abe2013Src). In colorectal cancer, ADAM28 is targeted by microRNA-552, which enhances metastatic capacity, indicating a complex role in cancer biology (Wang2016MicroRNA552). These findings highlight ADAM28's significance in cancer pathogenesis and its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target.

## Interactions
ADAM28 interacts with several proteins, influencing various biological processes. It binds to integrins such as α4β1, α4β7, and α9β1, promoting lymphocyte adhesion and migration to endothelial cells and leukocytes (Hubeau2020ADAM28:; McGinn2011Modulation). The interaction with integrin α4β1 is activation-dependent and enhances cell adhesion to VCAM-1, facilitating transendothelial migration (Fourie2024ADAM28; McGinn2011Modulation). ADAM28 also interacts with PSGL-1 on leukocytes, enhancing PSGL-1/P-selectin-mediated leukocyte rolling adhesion, which is crucial for leukocyte infiltration during inflammation (Hubeau2020ADAM28:).

ADAM28 cleaves several substrates, including myelin basic protein (MBP), CD23, and IGFBP-3, influencing immune responses and cell proliferation (Fourie2024ADAM28; Mochizuki2009ADAM28). It can also cleave Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF) from the CTGF/VEGF complex, releasing active VEGF and promoting angiogenesis (Hubeau2020ADAM28:). ADAM28's interaction with von Willebrand Factor (vWF) protects tumor cells from apoptosis, suggesting a role in cancer metastasis (Mochizuki2012Effect). The protein's activity is regulated by Tissue Inhibitors of Metalloproteinases (TIMPs), with TIMP-3 and TIMP-4 completely inhibiting its proteolytic activity (Hubeau2020ADAM28:).
