# MYOCOS

## Overview
The MYOCOS gene encodes the protein myocilin opposite strand, which is involved in various cellular processes. Myocilin opposite strand is categorized as a structural protein, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular integrity and function. It is expressed in several tissues, including the eye, where it is implicated in the regulation of intraocular pressure and may contribute to the pathophysiology of glaucoma. The protein's interactions with other cellular components suggest its involvement in complex signaling pathways, although the precise mechanisms remain under investigation. Understanding the function and regulation of MYOCOS and its encoded protein is essential for elucidating its role in health and disease.
