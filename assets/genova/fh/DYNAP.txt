# DYNAP

## Overview
DYNAP, or dynactin-associated protein, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly those related to intracellular transport and signaling pathways. The protein encoded by DYNAP is categorized as a cytoskeletal-associated protein, playing a crucial role in the function of the dynactin complex, which is integral to microtubule-based motor activities. This protein is implicated in the regulation of the PI3K-Akt-mTORC signaling pathway, influencing cellular growth and survival mechanisms. Additionally, DYNAP is involved in oncogenic processes, interacting with proteins such as H-Ras, which modulates its angiogenic potential. Clinically, mutations or dysregulation of the DYNAP gene have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), highlighting its significance in neuronal health and disease (Kunoh2015Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the DYNAP gene have been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, notably amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). These conditions are linked to the gene's critical role in axonal transport and neuronal function. In ALS, mutations in DYNAP can disrupt the normal transport of cellular components along axons, leading to the degeneration of motor neurons. This disruption is a key factor in the progressive muscle weakness and atrophy characteristic of the disease. Similarly, in SMA, alterations in DYNAP expression or function can impair motor neuron survival and function, contributing to the muscle wasting and motor difficulties observed in affected individuals. The involvement of DYNAP in these diseases underscores its importance in maintaining neuronal health and highlights the potential consequences of its dysfunction. Understanding the specific mechanisms by which DYNAP mutations or expression changes lead to these conditions remains an active area of research, with implications for developing targeted therapies to mitigate or reverse the effects of these neurodegenerative diseases.

## Interactions
DYNAP, or dynactin-associated protein, is involved in several critical interactions within the cell. It interacts with dynactin subunits, which are part of a microtubule-based motor protein complex, suggesting a role in cellular transport processes (Kunoh2015Human). DYNAP is also implicated in the PI3K-Akt-mTORC signaling pathway, where it promotes the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473. This phosphorylation is facilitated by mTORC2, a complex that includes the rictor subunit, which is upregulated by DYNAP. The presence of rictor in mTORC2 is essential for this phosphorylation event, highlighting DYNAP's role in enhancing Akt's activity and altering its substrate specificity (Kunoh2015Human).

In the context of oncogenic transformation, DYNAP interacts with H-Ras, where H-Ras represses the angiogenic potency of DYNAP. This interaction suggests a potential interplay between these proteins in tumor formation (Kunoh2015Human). DYNAP's involvement in these interactions underscores its significance in cellular processes related to growth, survival, and transformation, making it a potential target for cancer therapy (Kunoh2015Human).
