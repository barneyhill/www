# SFSWAP

## Overview
The SFSWAP gene encodes the splicing factor SWAP, a protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing. As a splicing factor, SWAP is involved in the precise removal of introns and the joining of exons, a process essential for the generation of mature messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules. This protein is categorized as a nuclear protein due to its localization and function within the cell nucleus. The activity of SWAP is critical for maintaining the fidelity of gene expression and ensuring the proper translation of genetic information into functional proteins. Aberrations in the function of splicing factors like SWAP can lead to various diseases, highlighting their importance in cellular homeostasis and human health (Qiu2020aarFDC).
