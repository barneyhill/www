# CPHXL

## Overview
The CPHXL gene encodes the protein known as cytoplasmic polyadenylated homeobox like, which is a member of the homeobox protein family. These proteins are typically involved in regulating gene expression, development, and cellular differentiation processes. The cytoplasmic polyadenylated homeobox like protein is characterized by its role in the cytoplasm, where it may participate in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Although the specific functions and interactions of CPHXL are not fully elucidated, it is hypothesized to play a role in developmental pathways and cellular homeostasis. Further research is needed to clarify its precise biological functions and potential implications in human health and disease.
