# FAM186B

## Overview
FAM186B is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 186 member B. This protein is implicated in various biological processes and disease contexts, including cancer and renal ciliopathies. FAM186B has been identified as a candidate gene in nephronophthisis-related ciliopathies (NPHP-RC) and is suggested to have a potential association with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) (Braun2016Whole; Azam2018Brief; Kals2019Advantages). The protein encoded by FAM186B interacts with other proteins, such as PPIA, in luminal breast cancer, highlighting its role in cancer biology (Jiao2024DSBSOBased). Despite these associations, the precise biological functions and mechanisms of FAM186B remain to be fully elucidated, necessitating further research to understand its role in health and disease.

## Clinical Significance
FAM186B has been identified as a novel candidate gene for nephronophthisis-related ciliopathies (NPHP-RC), a group of genetic disorders that affect kidney function. This association was discovered through whole exome sequencing and homozygosity mapping in consanguineous families, where mutations in known monogenic disease genes were excluded (Braun2016Whole; Azam2018Brief). The identification of FAM186B as a candidate gene suggests its potential involvement in renal ciliopathies, although further genetic and experimental evidence is needed to confirm its pathogenicity (Braun2016Whole).

In addition to its potential role in kidney-related conditions, FAM186B has been suggested to have a possible association with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). A study using data from the UK Biobank found a suggestive association between FAM186B and T1D, with a P-value of 1.60 × 10^-6, indicating a potential link that warrants further investigation (Kals2019Advantages). Despite these findings, the clinical significance of FAM186B remains under investigation, and its role in disease mechanisms is not yet fully understood. Further research is necessary to elucidate the specific conditions and mechanisms associated with alterations in FAM186B.

## Interactions
FAM186B has been identified as interacting with PPIA in luminal breast cancer, as revealed through XL-MS analysis of breast cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tissues. This interaction was also observed in previous XL-MS data of HEK293 cells, confirming the consistency of this protein-protein interaction across different biological contexts (Jiao2024DSBSOBased). The study of these interactions is crucial for understanding the role of FAM186B in cancer biology, particularly in the context of breast cancer subtypes. The interactions within the XL-PPI networks are influenced by protein abundance and disease states, which contribute to the understanding of tumorigenesis (Jiao2024DSBSOBased).

In addition to its role in breast cancer, FAM186B has been identified as a novel candidate gene in the context of nephronophthisis-related ciliopathies (NPHP-RC) through whole exome sequencing (WES) studies. Although specific interactions of FAM186B in this context are not detailed, its identification as a candidate gene suggests potential involvement in protein interaction networks related to renal diseases (Braun2016Whole). These findings highlight the diverse roles that FAM186B may play in different disease contexts through its interactions with other proteins.
