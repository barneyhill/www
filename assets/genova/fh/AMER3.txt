# AMER3

## Overview
AMER3, or APC membrane recruitment protein 3, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is essential for cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Unlike its family members AMER1 and AMER2, which act as negative regulators, the AMER3 protein functions as a positive regulator by enhancing Wnt signaling through interactions with the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein and Conductin/Axin2. This protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences the expression of β-catenin/T-cell factor (TCF) dependent genes. AMER3's role in modulating Wnt signaling is particularly significant in the context of colorectal cancer, where its overexpression can lead to increased signaling activity, suggesting a potential role in tumorigenesis (Brauburger2013Adenomatous).

## Structure
AMER3, also known as APC membrane recruitment protein 3, is a protein encoded by the human AMER3 gene. The complete coding sequence of AMER3 consists of 2586 nucleotides contained within a single exon, and it does not undergo alternative splicing, as only one long transcript has been detected (Boutet2010The; Brauburger2013Adenomatous).

The molecular structure of AMER3 includes conserved sequence blocks and domains that facilitate interaction with the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein. Specifically, AMER3 contains two conserved amino acid stretches within domains A1 and A2, which are crucial for binding to APC (Brauburger2013Adenomatous). These domains are similar to those found in other members of the Amer protein family, such as AMER1 and AMER2, which also interact with APC (Boutet2010The).

AMER3 lacks the N-terminal membrane localization domain present in AMER1 and AMER2, resulting in its localization primarily to the cytoplasm and nucleus rather than the plasma membrane (Brauburger2013Adenomatous). The protein's localization is regulated by specific nuclear import and export sequences, suggesting a role in nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling (Brauburger2013Adenomatous). The precise details of its secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not provided in the available context.

## Function
AMER3, also known as APC membrane recruitment protein 3, is a positive regulator of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Unlike its family members AMER1 and AMER2, which are negative regulators, AMER3 enhances Wnt signaling by interacting with the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein and the Wnt pathway regulator Conductin/Axin2 (Brauburger2013Adenomatous). AMER3 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus of epithelial cells, where it influences the expression of β-catenin/T-cell factor (TCF) dependent genes (Brauburger2013Adenomatous).

In colorectal cancer cells, AMER3 overexpression increases Wnt signaling activity, suggesting its role in hyperactivating this pathway (Brauburger2013Adenomatous). The protein's interaction with Conductin, but not Axin, indicates a unique role in modulating Wnt signaling, potentially through competition or cooperation with other Amer proteins (Brauburger2013Adenomatous). AMER3's activity is inhibited by the expression of APC, Conductin, or Axin, which are components of the β-catenin degradation complex, highlighting its involvement in the regulation of β-catenin levels (Brauburger2013Adenomatous).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the AMER3 gene can significantly impact its role in cellular signaling pathways, potentially contributing to the development of diseases such as cancer. Disruptions in the interactions of AMER3 may affect cell growth and division, leading to tumorigenesis. The gene's involvement in these critical cellular processes suggests that any deviations from its normal function could result in uncontrolled cell proliferation, a hallmark of cancer. Changes in AMER3 expression levels or mutations may disrupt its ability to properly recruit proteins to the cell membrane, thereby impairing signaling pathways that regulate cell cycle progression and apoptosis. This disruption can create an environment conducive to cancer development by allowing cells to evade normal growth controls and continue dividing unchecked. Understanding the specific mutations and expression changes in AMER3 that contribute to these processes is crucial for developing targeted therapies and improving cancer treatment outcomes.

## Interactions
AMER3, also known as APC membrane recruitment protein 3, is involved in several protein interactions that play a role in the Wnt signaling pathway. AMER3 interacts with the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein through two conserved domains, A1 and A2. Unlike its family members AMER1 and AMER2, which recruit APC to the plasma membrane, AMER3 is recruited to the cytoskeleton by APC (Brauburger2013Adenomatous). AMER3 also interacts with Conductin (Axin2) but not with Axin, despite the high conservation of the RGS domain between these proteins. This interaction suggests that AMER3 may modulate negative feedback signaling by Conductin in the Wnt pathway (Brauburger2013Adenomatous).

AMER3 can be recruited to the plasma membrane by AMER1, although it does not interact with AMER2. The interaction with AMER1 is mediated by specific amino acid sequences in both proteins (Brauburger2013Adenomatous). AMER3 is distributed between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, differing from AMER1 and AMER2, and contains nuclear localization and export signals, indicating its potential to shuttle between these cellular compartments (Brauburger2013Adenomatous). AMER3 enhances Wnt signaling by interacting with components of the β-catenin destruction complex, including APC and Conductin, and acts as an activator of Wnt signaling in colorectal cancer cells (Brauburger2013Adenomatous).
