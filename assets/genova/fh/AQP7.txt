# AQP7

## Overview
Aquaporin 7 (AQP7) is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein aquaporin 7, which belongs to the aquaglyceroporin subfamily of aquaporins. This protein is primarily involved in the transport of glycerol and water across cell membranes, playing a significant role in metabolic processes such as lipolysis and gluconeogenesis. AQP7 is predominantly expressed in adipose tissue, kidney, and testis, where it facilitates glycerol release and reabsorption, contributing to energy homeostasis and metabolic regulation. Structurally, aquaporin 7 forms a tetrameric assembly, with each monomer creating a selective channel for glycerol. The protein's function and interactions are modulated by various factors, including pH and hormonal signals, which influence its permeability and localization. Mutations and altered expression of the AQP7 gene have been associated with metabolic disorders, including obesity and type 2 diabetes, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining lipid metabolism and energy balance (Prudente2007A; Hibuse2005Aquaporin; Zhang2021The).

## Structure
Aquaporin 7 (AQP7) is a transmembrane protein that facilitates the transport of glycerol and water across cell membranes. The primary structure of AQP7 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming six transmembrane alpha-helices, which are characteristic of the aquaporin family (Verkman2000Structure). The secondary structure includes these helices connected by loops, with two half-membrane spanning helix-loop domains (Zhang2021The). AQP7 contains two highly conserved motifs, the Asn-Pro-Ala (NPA) motifs, which are crucial for its function, although in AQP7, these motifs are replaced by NAA and NPS (Huang2023CryoEM).

The tertiary structure of AQP7 forms a pore that is selective for glycerol, with a narrow permeation pathway less than 2.0 Å in diameter at the aromatic-arginine (Ar/R) filter and a gate region at the intracellular vestibule (Zhang2021The). The quaternary structure of AQP7 is typically a tetramer, with each monomer forming an individual glycerol channel (Zhang2021The). Cryo-electron microscopy studies have shown that AQP7 can also form dimers of tetramers, resulting in an octameric structure (Huang2023CryoEM). This octameric arrangement is stabilized by interactions involving specific residues in the extracellular loops (Huang2023CryoEM).

## Function
Aquaporin 7 (AQP7) is a crucial protein involved in the transport of glycerol and water across cell membranes, primarily expressed in adipose tissue, kidney, and testis. In adipose tissue, AQP7 facilitates the release of glycerol during lipolysis, a process where triglycerides are broken down into glycerol and free fatty acids. This glycerol is then transported into the bloodstream and taken up by the liver for gluconeogenesis, playing a significant role in energy metabolism and homeostasis (Mósca2018Molecular; Kitchen2015Beyond).

AQP7 is also expressed in the proximal tubule of the kidney, where it is involved in glycerol reabsorption, preventing its excretion in urine. This function is essential for maintaining normal blood glucose levels, especially during fasting (Mósca2018Molecular; Sohara2024Function). In the male reproductive system, AQP7 is found in spermatids and spermatozoa, suggesting a role in spermatogenesis and sperm motility, although knockout studies indicate it is not critical for fertility (Sohara2024Function).

The activity of AQP7 is regulated by pH, with its permeability to glycerol and water decreasing significantly at acidic pH levels, which may influence its function in different physiological conditions (Mósca2018Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the AQP7 gene have been linked to several metabolic disorders. The G264V mutation in AQP7 has been associated with hyperglyceroluria and a mild platelet secretion defect in children, although it does not appear to be linked to obesity or diabetes in these cases. This mutation affects glycerol and water transport, potentially impacting platelet function and morphology (Goubau2013Homozygosity).

Altered expression of AQP7 is implicated in obesity and type 2 diabetes. The A-953G single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the AQP7 promoter is associated with increased body mass index (BMI) and type 2 diabetes, particularly in females. This variant reduces transcriptional activity, leading to decreased AQP7 expression in adipose tissue, which may contribute to obesity and metabolic abnormalities (Prudente2007A).

AQP7 deficiency in animal models has been shown to result in obesity and insulin resistance due to impaired glycerol release and increased triglyceride synthesis. This suggests that AQP7 plays a critical role in maintaining normal lipid metabolism and energy balance (Hibuse2005Aquaporin).

## Interactions
AQP7, an aquaglyceroporin, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in glycerol transport and metabolic regulation. In adipocytes, AQP7 interacts with perilipin-1 (PLIN1), a protein located at the lipid droplet surface. This interaction involves the C-terminal part of PLIN1 and the N-terminus of AQP7, forming a complex that plays a significant role in triacylglycerol mobilization. The AQP7-PLIN1 complex dissociates upon catecholamine stimulation, allowing AQP7 to translocate to the plasma membrane and facilitate glycerol efflux. Conversely, the complex remains intact at the lipid droplet surface when insulin is present, indicating a regulatory mechanism influenced by hormonal signals (TörnrothHorsefield2022Insight; Roche2017Aquaporin).

AQP7 also forms dimers of tetramers, stabilized by interactions through extracellular loops, which are crucial for its structural integrity and function as a glycerol channel. These interactions are similar to those observed in other aquaporins, such as AQP0 and AQP4, which are known to facilitate cell-cell adhesion (Huang2023CryoEM). These structural interactions suggest a potential role for AQP7 as a junction protein, contributing to cell adhesion and metabolite distribution within tissues (Huang2023CryoEM).
