# ZNF574

## Overview
ZNF574 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 574, a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by the presence of multiple C2H2 zinc finger domains. These domains enable the protein to interact with DNA, RNA, and other proteins, playing a pivotal role in the quality control of ribosome biogenesis. Zinc finger protein 574 is involved in the Ribosome Assembly Surveillance Pathway (RASP), where it identifies and targets defective large ribosomal subunit intermediates for degradation, thereby ensuring proper ribosome assembly and function. This process is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis and cellular health, as the accumulation of defective ribosomes can lead to cellular stress and disease (Akers2024ZNF574). The protein is ubiquitously expressed and localizes in the nucleoplasm and cellular speckles, indicating its fundamental role across various tissues and organs (Akers2024ZNF574).

## Structure
ZNF574 is a zinc finger protein characterized by the presence of 20 C2H2 zinc finger domains, which are known to interact with DNA, RNA, or proteins (Akers2024ZNF574). The protein has an approximate molecular weight of 99 kDa and is involved in the quality control of ribosome biogenesis, specifically targeting defective large ribosomal subunits for degradation (Akers2024ZNF574). The last four C2H2 domains of ZNF574 are crucial for its function in degrading ribosomal subunits with the uL16 mutation, and deletion of any of these domains disrupts this quality control activity (Akers2024ZNF574).

Despite attempts to predict its structure using computational tools like AlphaFold, a confident tertiary structure for the full-length ZNF574 has not been obtained (Akers2024ZNF574). The C-terminal region, containing the last four C2H2 domains, is suggested to form a structured tertiary fold, while other parts of the protein are not predicted to form long-range interactions (Akers2024ZNF574). ZNF574 functions as a monomer, as quaternary structure is less common in zinc finger proteins. The protein is ubiquitously expressed, indicating its role in fundamental cellular processes (Akers2024ZNF574).

## Function
ZNF574 is a zinc finger protein involved in the quality control of ribosome biogenesis in human cells. It plays a crucial role in the Ribosome Assembly Surveillance Pathway (RASP), which is responsible for identifying and degrading defective ribosome biogenesis intermediates. ZNF574 targets faulty large ribosomal subunit intermediates for degradation, ensuring proper ribosome assembly and function. This process is vital for maintaining protein homeostasis and cellular health, as the accumulation of defective ribosomes can lead to decreased protein synthesis and increased cellular stress (Akers2024ZNF574).

ZNF574 is not an E3 ligase itself but may recruit E3 ligases and other factors to facilitate the degradation of defective ribosomal components through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. It interacts with various ribosome biogenesis intermediates, and its C2H2 zinc finger domains are essential for recognizing and engaging these intermediates (Akers2024ZNF574). ZNF574 is ubiquitously expressed and localizes in the nucleoplasm and cellular speckles, similar to other late ribosome biogenesis factors, indicating its fundamental role in cellular processes across all tissues and organs (Akers2024ZNF574).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF574 is implicated in the quality control of ribosome biogenesis, specifically targeting defective large ribosomal subunits for degradation. Mutations or loss of function in ZNF574 can lead to the accumulation of defective ribosome intermediates, resulting in decreased ribosome production and protein synthesis, increased cellular stress, and potentially cell death (Akers2024ZNF574). These disruptions in ribosome biogenesis are associated with pathological phenotypes similar to ribosomopathies, which include severe anemias, cancer predisposition, skeletal abnormalities, and growth retardation (Akers2024ZNF574). Although specific diseases directly linked to ZNF574 mutations are not detailed, the gene's role in ribosome assembly surveillance suggests that its dysfunction could contribute to conditions characterized by defects in ribosome biogenesis (Akers2024ZNF574).

The study highlights the importance of ZNF574 in maintaining cellular health by preventing the sequestration of assembly factors on defective ribosomes, which can lead to global defects in ribosome production (Akers2024ZNF574). This underscores the potential clinical significance of ZNF574 in diseases related to ribosome biogenesis defects.

## Interactions
ZNF574 is involved in ribosome biogenesis and functions as a quality control factor in the Ribosome Assembly Surveillance Pathway (RASP). It interacts with defective ribosome intermediates, particularly binding to faulty pre-ribosomes and mediating their degradation. This interaction is stronger with mutant uL16 compared to the wild-type, indicating a preference for defective ribosomal components (Akers2024ZNF574). ZNF574 predominantly co-migrates with 60S ribosomal subunits and, to a lesser extent, with 40S subunits and 80S monosomes. The protein contains 20 C2H2 zinc finger domains, which are crucial for its function, allowing it to bind to RNA and other proteins (Akers2024ZNF574).

ZNF574's role in ribosome biogenesis is further highlighted by its interaction with eIF6, a biogenesis factor. Loss of ZNF574 leads to the cytoplasmic accumulation of eIF6 due to its binding to defective 60S subunits, preventing the release of eIF6 necessary for 60S maturation (Akers2024ZNF574). The study suggests that ZNF574 may recruit E3 ligases and other factors to degrade faulty ribosomal RNA, although ZNF574 itself is not an E3 ligase (Akers2024ZNF574). These interactions are crucial for maintaining normal ribosome production and preventing the accumulation of defective intermediates.
