# IL13RA2

## Overview
The IL13RA2 gene encodes the interleukin 13 receptor subunit alpha 2 (IL-13Rα2), a glycosylated transmembrane protein that primarily functions as a decoy receptor for interleukin 13 (IL-13) (Daines2006Level; ANDREWS2006IL13). This receptor is characterized by its high-affinity binding to IL-13, sequestering the cytokine and modulating immune responses, particularly in allergic inflammation and asthma (Tabata2006AllergyDriven). IL-13Rα2 is predominantly intracellular but can be mobilized to the cell surface, where it continues to act as a decoy receptor (Daines2006Level). Beyond its decoy function, IL-13Rα2 is involved in signaling pathways through interactions with other proteins, such as TMEM219, influencing processes like apoptosis inhibition and tissue protection (Lee2016IL13Rα2). The protein's role extends to various pathological conditions, including cancer, where its expression is linked to tumor progression and metastasis, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Papageorgis2015Targeting; Li2024Expression).

## Structure
The IL13RA2 gene encodes the interleukin-13 receptor subunit alpha 2, a glycosylated transmembrane protein with a calculated molecular mass of 56 kDa. The human IL-13Rα2 protein consists of 380 amino acids, including a 26-amino acid N-terminal signal sequence, a large extracellular domain of 317 amino acids, a 20-amino acid transmembrane domain, and a 17-amino acid intracellular domain (Tabata2007IL13; Jannoo2017Interleukin13). The extracellular domain features an N-terminal fibronectin-like domain, four conserved cysteine residues, and a WSXWS motif, which are essential for its high-affinity binding to interleukin-13 (Tabata2007IL13).

The protein's extracellular domain is characterized by an N-terminal S-type Ig region followed by two fibronectin III-like regions, forming the cytokine-binding homology region (CHR). This structure facilitates the interaction with IL-13 at two specific sites, termed 'site II' and 'site III', through disulfide and hydrogen bonds (Jannoo2017Interleukin13). N-linked glycosylation within the extracellular domain is crucial for IL-13 binding (Tabata2007IL13).

IL-13Rα2 exists in membrane-bound, intracellular, and soluble forms, with the soluble form generated by alternative splicing, which lacks the transmembrane domain (Tabata2007IL13). The soluble form has a molecular weight of 45 to 50 kDa and exhibits even higher affinity for IL-13 compared to its membrane-bound counterpart (Tabata2007IL13).

## Function
The IL13RA2 gene encodes the interleukin 13 receptor subunit alpha 2 (IL-13Ra2), which functions primarily as a decoy receptor for interleukin 13 (IL-13) in human cells. IL-13Ra2 binds IL-13 with high affinity, sequestering the cytokine and preventing it from interacting with the signaling receptor complex IL-13Ra1/IL-4Ra, thereby modulating IL-13 signaling pathways (Daines2006Level; ANDREWS2006IL13). This decoy function is crucial in regulating immune responses, particularly in the context of allergic inflammation and asthma, where IL-13 plays a significant role (Tabata2006AllergyDriven).

IL-13Ra2 is predominantly found intracellularly but can be mobilized to the cell surface, where it continues to act as a decoy receptor (Daines2006Level). In addition to its role as a decoy, IL-13Ra2 has been implicated in signaling pathways when interacting with other proteins, such as TMEM219. This interaction is essential for the activation of MAPK and Akt signaling pathways, which are involved in processes like apoptosis inhibition and tissue protection against oxidant injury (Lee2016IL13Rα2). These functions highlight IL-13Ra2's role in modulating immune responses and protecting against tissue damage in healthy cells.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the IL13RA2 gene have been implicated in various cancers and other diseases. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), IL13RA2 is associated with resistance to sunitinib, a common treatment for metastatic RCC. Studies have shown that IL13RA2 is significantly upregulated in sunitinib-resistant tumors, suggesting its role as a potential marker for drug resistance and poor prognosis in ccRCC (Shibasaki2015Role).

In brainstem gliomas, particularly those with the H3.3-K27M mutation, IL13RA2 is overexpressed and linked to increased malignancy and poor patient outcomes. Its expression correlates with high cell proliferation and cancer stem cell properties, making it a promising target for CAR-T cell therapy and other immunotherapies (Li2024Expression).

In breast cancer, IL13RA2 is overexpressed in metastatic cells and is associated with poor prognosis, particularly in basal-like breast cancers. It plays a role in promoting metastasis through the STAT6-TP63 signaling pathway, and its knockdown has been shown to reduce lung metastasis in experimental models (Papageorgis2015Targeting).

IL13RA2 is also implicated in the pathogenesis of proliferative vitreoretinopathy, an eye disease, where its expression affects collagen gel contraction and other cellular processes (Qi2022A).

## Interactions
IL13RA2, or interleukin 13 receptor subunit alpha 2, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its signaling capabilities. It interacts with the scaffold protein FAM120A, which is crucial for activating the FAK and PI3K pathways in colon cancer metastasis. This interaction is essential for IL13RA2's role in cell migration, invasion, and survival, as well as for its localization to the cell membrane (Bartolomé2015IL13).

IL13RA2 also forms a multimeric complex with Chi3l1/YKL-40 and IL-13, which is significant for activating signaling pathways such as MAPK, AKT, and Wnt/β-catenin. This complex does not interfere with the individual signaling pathways of Chi3l1/YKL-40 and IL-13, indicating distinct binding sites on IL13RA2 for these proteins (He2013Chitinase).

In the context of inflammatory bowel disease, IL13RA2 interacts with chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1/YKL-40) in complex with TMEM219 or Galectin-3 (Gal-3), affecting cellular responses such as cell death and inflammasome activation. These interactions are involved in modulating signaling pathways like Erk, Akt, and Wnt/β-catenin (Verstockt2018Effects).
