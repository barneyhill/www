# FZD5

## Overview
FZD5, or frizzled class receptor 5, is a gene that encodes a member of the frizzled family of G protein-coupled receptors, which are integral to the Wnt signaling pathway. The protein product of FZD5, frizzled class receptor 5, is characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain and a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) that facilitates the binding of Wnt ligands. This receptor is involved in both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways, playing a pivotal role in cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and migration. FZD5 is particularly significant in ocular development and the maintenance of mesenchymal stem cell functions. Mutations in the FZD5 gene have been linked to developmental eye disorders, including coloboma, and its dysregulation is implicated in certain cancers, such as triple-negative breast cancer, where it contributes to tumor progression and chemoresistance (Sun2020FZD5; Liu2016A).

## Structure
Frizzled Class Receptor 5 (FZD5) is a member of the Frizzled family of G protein-coupled receptors, characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure. The protein includes a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) that is crucial for binding Wnt ligands. This CRD is composed of approximately 120 amino acids and forms a compact globular structure with a hydrophobic groove, which is essential for recognizing the fatty acyl moiety of Wnt proteins (Nile2019Fatty). The CRD of FZD5, along with those of FZD7 and FZD8, forms a dimeric structure with an α-helical dimer interface and a U-shaped lipid-binding cavity. This cavity is important for binding fatty acids, such as the C16:1n-7 fatty acid, which acts as a surrogate for the Wnt fatty acyl group (Nile2019Fatty).

The hydrophobic cavity in FZD5 is formed by specific residues, including Phe-125, Leu-73, Met-120, Tyr-123, and Pro-72, which help in burying the fatty acid within the cavity (Nile2019Fatty). The structural plasticity of the fatty acyl-binding groove allows for flexibility in fatty acid binding and selectivity, which may regulate the receptor's interactions with different ligands (Nile2019Fatty). The FZD5 CRD can also form higher-order structures, suggesting a potential for oligomerization, although biochemical evidence is limited (DeBruine2017Wnt5a).

## Function
FZD5 (frizzled class receptor 5) is a transmembrane receptor that plays a crucial role in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is essential for various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and migration. In healthy human cells, FZD5 is involved in both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways. The canonical pathway involves the stabilization and nuclear translocation of β-catenin, which activates TCF-dependent transcription, while the non-canonical pathway involves the activation of RhoA, a small GTPase important for cytoskeletal dynamics and cell movement (Liu2016A).

FZD5 is particularly important in ocular development, where it mediates non-canonical Wnt signaling in the developing retina. This signaling is crucial for maintaining the integrity of apical junctions in retinal neuroblasts, which are vital for the proliferation, survival, and maturation of progenitor cells (Liu2016A). Disruption of FZD5 function can lead to ocular malformations such as coloboma and microphthalmia (Liu2016A).

In human mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (hMSCs), FZD5 is involved in regulating cellular senescence and maintaining the proliferative and differentiation capacities of these cells. It is expressed in rapidly expanding clones of hMSCs, which exhibit strong multilineage differentiation and self-renewal capabilities (Harada2020FZD5). FZD5's role in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining the regenerative potential of stem cells (Harada2020FZD5).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FZD5 gene are associated with ocular coloboma, a developmental eye disorder characterized by defects in the eye structure, such as the iris and retina. Studies have identified various mutations in FZD5, including heterozygous in-frame deletions and frameshift mutations, which are linked to both familial and sporadic cases of coloboma. These mutations disrupt the Wnt signaling pathway, crucial for eye development, leading to conditions like microphthalmia and coloboma (Liu2016A; AubertMucca2020Confirmation).

A specific frameshift mutation, A219Xfs*49, results in a truncated FZD5 protein that acts as a secreted antagonist, impairing both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling. This mutation has been shown to cause autosomal dominant coloboma by disrupting retinal development and neurogenesis (Liu2016A).

In cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), FZD5 is overexpressed and contributes to tumor proliferation, DNA damage repair, and chemoresistance. FZD5 signaling involves the transcription factor FOXM1, which enhances the expression of genes like BRCA1 and BIRC5, promoting cell survival and resistance to chemotherapy. Targeting FZD5 may offer a therapeutic strategy to overcome chemoresistance in TNBC (Sun2020FZD5).

## Interactions
FZD5, a member of the frizzled family of G protein-coupled receptors, interacts with various proteins to mediate Wnt signaling pathways. It specifically binds to WNT-5A, leading to the activation of Gαq proteins, which results in downstream signaling events such as the release of intracellular Ca2+ and activation of protein kinase C (PKC) (Wright2018FZD). FZD5 also interacts with WNT7A, binding to its cysteine-rich domain (CRD) with high affinity, which is crucial for activating the β-catenin/canonical Wnt signaling pathway (Carmon2008Wnt7a).

In addition to WNT proteins, FZD5 forms complexes with Dishevelled proteins, such as xDsh, which are recruited to the membrane upon WNT7A binding, leading to signaling activation (Carmon2008Wnt7a). FZD5 also interacts with low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) to regulate the proliferation and self-renewal of endometrial mesenchymal stem-like cells through the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway (Li2022WNT5A). These interactions highlight the role of FZD5 in various cellular processes, including proliferation and differentiation, by mediating specific signaling pathways through its interactions with WNT proteins and other signaling components.
