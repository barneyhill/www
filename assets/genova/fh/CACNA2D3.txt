# CACNA2D3

## Overview
The CACNA2D3 gene encodes the calcium voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit alpha2delta 3 (α2δ-3), a critical component of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) in vertebrates. This protein functions as an auxiliary subunit, enhancing the efficiency of calcium ion transport across cell membranes, which is essential for various physiological processes, including synaptic transmission and neuronal signaling. The α2δ-3 subunit is characterized by its involvement in protein-protein interactions, facilitated by its von Willebrand factor type A (VWA) domain, and its membrane anchoring through a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. It is expressed in the brain, skeletal muscle, and heart, where it plays a role in synaptic localization and function. Mutations in CACNA2D3 have been associated with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder and anxiety, highlighting its significance in neural adaptation and sensory processing (Santistevan2022cacna2d3; Ablinger2020Neuronal; Dolphin2013The).

## Structure
The CACNA2D3 gene encodes the α2δ-3 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, which plays a crucial role in calcium ion transport across cell membranes. The α2δ-3 protein is synthesized as a single precursor that undergoes post-translational cleavage into two peptides, α2 and δ, which are linked by disulfide bonds (Dolphin2013The; Dolphin2018Voltagegated). The α2 peptide is primarily extracellular and contains a von Willebrand factor type A (VWA) domain, which includes a metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) crucial for protein-protein interactions (Geisler2015Emerging; Dolphin2013The). The δ peptide is likely anchored to the plasma membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, although it may also form a transmembrane α-helix (Ablinger2020Neuronal; Dolphin2013The).

The α2δ-3 subunit is heavily glycosylated, a modification essential for its membrane expression and function (Geisler2015Emerging). While specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of CACNA2D3 are not provided, the protein's structure includes Cache domains, which are involved in protein interactions (Dolphin2018Voltagegated). The α2δ-3 subunit is expressed in the brain, skeletal muscle, and heart, with potential roles in synaptic localization and function (Dolphin2013The).

## Function
The CACNA2D3 gene encodes the calcium voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit α2δ3, which is integral to the function of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) in vertebrates. This subunit is involved in enhancing the coupling between calcium influx and neurotransmitter release at the presynaptic terminal, thereby playing a crucial role in synaptic transmission (Santistevan2022cacna2d3). The α2δ3 subunit is generated through the proteolytic cleavage of a precursor protein, and a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor is added in the endoplasmic reticulum, anchoring it to the cell membrane (Santistevan2022cacna2d3).

Beyond presynaptic functions, α2δ3 contributes to dendritic computations, shapes action potentials in axons, and mediates calcium-channel dependent gene regulation (Santistevan2022cacna2d3). In the context of the Mauthner neuron, dendritic calcium signaling, influenced by α2δ3, determines startle probability, highlighting its role in sensory processing and neural adaptation (Santistevan2022cacna2d3). The gene is highly conserved across vertebrates, indicating its essential role in these processes (Santistevan2022cacna2d3). Mutations in CACNA2D3 have been linked to impaired habituation and increased sensitivity to acoustic stimuli, which are associated with disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and anxiety in humans (Santistevan2022cacna2d3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CACNA2D3 gene have been linked to several neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. This gene encodes the α2δ-3 protein, a subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, which plays a crucial role in synaptic transmission and neuronal signaling. Variations in CACNA2D3 have been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), where inherited mutations can lead to splicing disruptions or copy number variations (Ablinger2020Neuronal). In ASD patients, specific mutations such as a splice site mutation at the beginning of exon 24 have been identified (Ablinger2020Neuronal). 

The gene is also implicated in auditory processing deficits, as seen in Cacna2d3-deficient mice, which exhibit impaired subcortical processing of amplitude-modulated tones, a condition relevant to ASD (Bracic2022Impaired). These mice show altered auditory brainstem responses and synaptic function, despite normal hearing thresholds (Wadle2022Altered).

CACNA2D3 has been linked to nicotine dependence (ND) through genome-wide meta-analyses, identifying specific SNPs associated with ND risk and mRNA expression levels in brain regions (Yin2017Genome‐wide). The gene is also associated with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder, with certain SNPs linked to these conditions (Ablinger2020Neuronal).

## Interactions
The CACNA2D3 gene encodes the α2δ-3 subunit, which is involved in various interactions crucial for its function in voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). The α2δ-3 subunit interacts with the α1 subunits of VGCCs, enhancing their plasma membrane expression and modulating their current properties. These interactions are relatively weak and dynamic, suggesting transient associations with calcium channels (Risher2020Emerging; Ablinger2020Neuronal).

The α2δ-3 subunit also interacts with synaptic proteins, playing a role in synapse formation and function. It is involved in the regulation of synaptic vesicle accumulation and active zone architecture, interacting with proteins such as thrombospondin-4 (TSP-4), which can increase calcium currents and contribute to excitatory synaptogenesis (Ablinger2020Neuronal). The interaction with TSP-4 can be inhibited by gabapentin, a drug used to treat neuropathic pain (Ablinger2020Neuronal).

Additionally, α2δ-3 may interact with cell adhesion molecules like neurexins and neuroligins, as well as extracellular matrix proteins, influencing synaptic transmission and intracellular signaling pathways (Ablinger2020Neuronal). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of CACNA2D3 in neuronal activity and plasticity.
