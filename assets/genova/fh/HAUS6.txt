# HAUS6

## Overview
The HAUS6 gene encodes the HAUS augmin-like complex subunit 6 protein, which is a critical component of the augmin complex involved in microtubule organization during cell division. This protein plays a pivotal role in the assembly and stabilization of the mitotic spindle, a structure essential for accurate chromosome segregation. HAUS6 is categorized as a microtubule-associated protein due to its involvement in microtubule nucleation and binding, facilitated by its structural similarity to other microtubule-binding proteins (Zupa2022The). The protein is integral to the recruitment of the γ-Tubulin Ring Complex (γ-TuRC) to the spindle, ensuring proper spindle formation and centrosome integrity (Habermann2012New; Lawo2009HAUS). Additionally, HAUS6 contributes to centriole stability and architecture, highlighting its multifaceted role in maintaining cellular structure and function during mitosis (Schweizer2021Subcentrosomal).

## Structure
The HAUS6 protein is a subunit of the augmin complex, which plays a crucial role in microtubule organization during cell division. The N-terminal domains of HAUS6 are predicted to fold into globular domains with high structural similarity to the calponin homology (CH) domain, which is known for microtubule binding (Zupa2022The). These CH domains share 10-20% sequence identity with other microtubule-binding proteins, suggesting a similar function in microtubule binding (Zupa2022The). The HAUS6 subunit is part of the TII tetramer within the augmin complex, which has a clamp-like structure with coiled-coil helices formed by the N-terminal (N-clamp) and C-terminal segments (Zupa2022The).

The augmin complex, including HAUS6, is involved in microtubule binding and nucleation, with its interaction modulated by phosphorylation and regulated by importins and Ran-GTP (Ustinova2023Microtubule). The HAUS6 protein, along with HAUS7, forms part of a composite microtubule binding site, and its structural similarity to the Ndc80 complex suggests a potential binding pattern along the microtubule lattice (Zupa2022The). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure of HAUS6 are not provided in the available excerpts.

## Function
HAUS6, a subunit of the HAUS augmin-like complex, plays a critical role in microtubule organization during cell division. It is essential for maintaining mitotic spindle assembly and centrosome integrity. HAUS6 is involved in the recruitment of the γ-Tubulin Ring Complex (γ-TuRC) to the mitotic spindle, which is crucial for microtubule nucleation and the formation of a robust bipolar spindle (Habermann2012New). This recruitment is necessary for the maturation of kinetochore fibers and proper chromosome segregation (Lawo2009HAUS).

HAUS6 also contributes to centriole stability and architecture. It localizes to the centriole lumen and is vital for maintaining proper centriole length and structure. The absence of HAUS6 results in short and broken centrioles, indicating its role in centriole stabilization (Schweizer2021Subcentrosomal). HAUS6 is recruited to the inner centriole scaffold by POC5, highlighting its importance in maintaining centriole integrity (Schweizer2021Subcentrosomal).

In addition, HAUS6 is involved in the relocalization of the HAUS complex to spindle microtubules, which is crucial for proper spindle assembly and centrosome integrity. Its depletion leads to disorganized spindles and fragmented centrosomes, underscoring its role in spindle integrity (Lawo2009HAUS).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the HAUS6 gene have been implicated in the progression of low-grade gliomas (LGG). HAUS6, as part of the Augmin complex, shows increased mRNA expression in LGG samples compared to normal brain tissue, which is associated with tumor progression. However, its expression does not correlate with overall survival or disease-free survival in LGG patients (Wang2023A). The gene is also linked to immune cell infiltration, particularly with CD8+ T cells, B cells, and macrophages, suggesting a role in the tumor microenvironment and immune regulation in LGG (Wang2023A).

In addition to its role in gliomas, HAUS6 is crucial for centriole stability and architecture. Knockout studies have shown that the absence of HAUS6 leads to reduced centriole length and abnormal architecture, which can affect cellular processes such as ciliogenesis (Schweizer2021Subcentrosomal). While specific diseases directly associated with HAUS6 mutations are not detailed, disruptions in its function could potentially contribute to conditions related to centriole and cilia dysfunction, such as primary microcephaly and retinopathy, as seen with related γTuRC subunit mutations (Schweizer2021Subcentrosomal).

## Interactions
HAUS6 is a subunit of the augmin complex, which is essential for microtubule organization during cell division. It interacts with other augmin subunits, such as HAUS1-8, to facilitate microtubule nucleation. HAUS6 also associates with the γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC) to enhance microtubule assembly, playing a role in mitotic spindle formation. HAUS6 interacts with importins and Ran-GTP, which regulate its binding to microtubules. Importins inhibit the HAUS complex's ability to bind microtubules, a process that is relieved by Ran-GTP, suggesting a regulatory mechanism for microtubule binding (Ustinova2023Microtubule).

HAUS6 forms part of the TII tetramer within the augmin complex, interacting with HAUS7 to form a hammerhead-like structure. This interaction is crucial for microtubule binding and stabilization (Zupa2022The). HAUS6 also interacts with NEDD1, a component of the γ-TuRC, which is necessary for microtubule amplification during mitosis (Shen2022DownRegulating). Additionally, HAUS6 is involved in centriole stabilization, interacting with proteins such as POC5, which recruits HAUS6 to the inner centriole scaffold (Schweizer2021Subcentrosomal). These interactions highlight HAUS6's role in maintaining spindle and centrosome integrity.
