# APEX2

## Overview
APEX2 is a gene that encodes the protein apurinic/apyrimidinic endodeoxyribonuclease 2, which is a crucial component of the DNA repair machinery. This protein belongs to the ExoIII superfamily and is primarily involved in the base excision repair (BER) pathway, where it plays a significant role in maintaining genomic stability by repairing oxidative DNA damage (Ide2003Characterization). APEX2 is characterized by its ability to cleave the phosphodiester backbone at apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites, facilitating the repair synthesis by DNA polymerase. Unlike its homolog APEX1, APEX2 has a unique interaction with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), suggesting a specialized function in postreplicative BER (Ide2003Characterization). The protein is active in both the nucleus and mitochondria, indicating its involvement in DNA repair across different cellular compartments (Ide2003Characterization). Additionally, APEX2 is utilized in advanced molecular techniques to map RNA-protein interactions, highlighting its versatility in cellular processes (Han2020RNA–protein).

## Structure
The APEX2 protein is encoded by the human APEX2 gene and is involved in DNA repair processes. The primary structure of APEX2 consists of a sequence of amino acids that are 80% conserved between humans and mice, indicating a significant degree of evolutionary conservation (Ide2003Characterization). The secondary structure of APEX2 includes 14 alpha helices and 4 beta sheets, which are typical features of proteins in the ExoIII superfamily (Xue2017Optimizing). 

The N-terminal region of APEX2 contains well-maintained ExoIII nuclease domain elements, which are crucial for its enzymatic activity (Ide2003Characterization). The C-terminal region is more diverse, with only 50% conservation, suggesting potential roles in protein-protein interactions, including binding with PCNA (Ide2003Characterization). 

APEX2 is a monomeric protein, similar in size to GFP, and it contains a noncovalently bound heme cofactor in its active site, which is essential for its peroxidase activity (Hung2016Spatially). The protein also possesses a mitochondrial targeting sequence, indicating its localization to mitochondria, in addition to its nuclear presence (Ide2003Characterization). 

The APEX2 protein does not have a quaternary structure as it functions as a monomer. There is no specific information on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms in the provided context.

## Function
APEX2 is a DNA repair enzyme involved in the base excision repair (BER) pathway, which is crucial for maintaining genomic stability by repairing oxidative DNA damage. It functions by cleaving the phosphodiester backbone at apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites, generating 3'-OH termini necessary for repair synthesis by DNA polymerase (Ide2003Characterization). APEX2 is distinct from APEX1 due to its ability to bind proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), suggesting a specific role in postreplicative BER, particularly in the repair of inappropriate bases incorporated during DNA replication (Ide2003Characterization).

APEX2 exhibits lower catalytic activity compared to APEX1, but its interaction with PCNA indicates a specialized function in DNA repair processes that are dependent on cell proliferation (Ide2003Characterization). The protein is active in both the nucleus and mitochondria, indicating its involvement in DNA repair within these cellular compartments (Ide2003Characterization). In the thymus, APEX2 is essential for normal DNA replication and repair, as its absence leads to increased DNA strand breaks and altered expression of genes involved in DNA damage response pathways (Dan2008Altered).

## Clinical Significance
APEX2 plays a significant role in various diseases and conditions due to its involvement in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation. In APEX2-null mice, the absence of this gene leads to growth retardation, thymic atrophy, and dyslymphopoiesis, characterized by a significant reduction in B lymphocytes and thymocytes. These mice also exhibit increased sensitivity to DNA damage, such as x-ray exposure, resulting in higher apoptosis rates in thymocytes (Ide2004Growth). The deficiency in APEX2 causes delayed cell cycle progression, particularly in the S and G2/M phases, leading to impaired lymphopoiesis and an attenuated immune response (Ide2004Growth).

In osteoarthritis, APEX2 is expressed in degenerated cartilage, suggesting its involvement in the disease's pathogenesis. The enzyme helps protect against the down-regulation of chondrocyte activity in response to oxidative stress and catabolic factors, indicating its potential role in maintaining cartilage integrity (Yui2014The).

APEX2 is also implicated in cancer, particularly in bone and soft tissue sarcomas. Lower expression of APEX2 correlates with a better response to treatments like trabectedin and olaparib, suggesting its role in homologous recombination and treatment resistance (Merlini2022DNA).

## Interactions
APEX2 is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in cellular processes. It is used in proximity labeling to map RNA-protein interactions in living cells. APEX2 can be targeted to specific RNAs using systems like MS2-MCP and CRISPR-Cas13, allowing the identification of proteins interacting with RNAs such as human telomerase RNA (hTR) and MALAT1. This interaction mapping has revealed that APEX2 can identify proteins involved in RNA biogenesis and function, such as the interaction between hTR and the N6-methyladenosine demethylase ALKBH5, which modulates telomerase complex assembly and activity (Han2020RNA–protein).

APEX2 is also used to detect protein-protein interactions in live cells through a protein-fragment complementation assay. This method involves splitting APEX2 into two fragments that reconstitute its enzymatic activity upon interaction, allowing the detection of specific protein interactions, such as those between STIM1 and Orai1, which are involved in calcium homeostasis (Xue2017Optimizing). These interactions highlight APEX2's utility in studying both stable and transient interactions within cellular environments.
