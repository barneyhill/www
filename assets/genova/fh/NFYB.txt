# NFYB

## Overview
NFYB, or nuclear transcription factor Y subunit beta, is a gene that encodes a protein component of the NF-Y transcription factor complex, which is crucial for the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic cells. The NFYB protein is characterized by its histone fold domain, which facilitates its role in DNA binding and dimerization with the NF-YC subunit, forming a stable heterodimer. This dimer subsequently associates with NF-YA to form a heterotrimeric complex that binds specifically to the CCAAT box, a common promoter element in many genes (Bellorini1997CCAAT; Zemzoumi1999NFY). As a transcription factor, NFYB is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, metabolism, and stem cell maintenance (Radomska1999A; Fleming2013NF-Y). Additionally, NFYB has been implicated in the progression and drug resistance of several cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Fang2018NFYBinduced; Liu2024Unraveling).

## Structure
NFYB, or nuclear transcription factor Y subunit beta, is a component of the NF-Y complex, which binds to CCAAT motifs in DNA. The primary structure of NFYB consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its function. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a stable three-dimensional shape, essential for its interaction with DNA and other proteins.

NFYB is characterized by the presence of a histone fold domain, which facilitates DNA binding and dimerization. This domain is crucial for the protein's role in forming the NF-Y complex, as it allows NFYB to interact with the NF-YA and NF-YC subunits, contributing to the quaternary structure of the complex. This interaction is vital for the transcriptional regulation activities of the NF-Y complex.

Common post-translational modifications of NFYB may include phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions. While the context does not provide specific details on splice variant isoforms for NFYB, such isoforms can result in functional diversity, potentially affecting the protein's regulatory roles (Li1992Intronexon).

## Function
NFYB, a subunit of the NF-Y transcription factor complex, plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression in healthy human cells. It is part of a trimeric complex that includes NF-YA and NF-YC, which binds to the CCAAT motif, a common promoter element in eukaryotic genes (Fleming2013NF-Y). NFYB is involved in the regulation of genes associated with cell signaling, DNA repair, cell-cycle regulation, metabolism, and gene expression (Fleming2013NF-Y). 

The NF-Y complex, including NFYB, is known to bind asymmetrically to DNA, with NF-YA binding directly over the CCAAT sequence and NFYB binding approximately 15 base pairs downstream (Fleming2013NF-Y). This binding pattern allows NFYB to influence a wide range of cellular processes by regulating genes beyond traditional promoter regions (Fleming2013NF-Y). 

NFYB is also involved in the transcriptional regulation of genes critical for stem cell maintenance and function, such as the CD34 gene, where it positively regulates expression by binding to specific sites in the gene's promoter (Radomska1999A). Additionally, NFYB plays a role in the regulation of metabolic pathways, particularly in the expression of glycolytic genes, which are essential for energy production in cells (Benatti2015NF-Y).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NFYB gene have been implicated in various cancers, contributing to disease progression and drug resistance. In glioblastoma (GBM), high NFYB expression is associated with increased cell division, reduced apoptosis, and enhanced tumor progression. It is also linked to resistance to chemotherapy, making it a potential therapeutic target for inhibiting tumor growth and recurrence (Liu2024Unraveling). NFYB is particularly significant in a GBM subgroup with high proliferative capacity, suggesting its role in GBM proliferation and resistance to recurrence (Liu2024Unraveling).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), NFYB contributes to oxaliplatin resistance through the NFYB-E2F1-CHK1 pathway. This pathway is involved in the DNA damage response, and its activation is linked to poor prognosis in CRC patients treated with oxaliplatin (Fang2018NFYBinduced). NFYB's role in drug resistance is further supported by its involvement in the expression of cell cycle-related genes (Fang2018NFYBinduced).

In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), NFYB enhances STK33 expression, leading to increased resistance to cisplatin and reduced apoptosis. This suggests that NFYB may play a role in modulating drug resistance in DLBCL (Feng2021NFYB).

## Interactions
NFYB, a subunit of the NF-Y transcription factor complex, participates in several protein-protein interactions crucial for its function in transcriptional regulation. NFYB forms a stable heterodimer with NF-YC through histone fold domains, which is essential for binding to the CCAAT box in DNA promoters (Bellorini1997CCAAT; Zemzoumi1999NFY). This dimerization is a prerequisite for the subsequent association with NF-YA, forming a heterotrimeric complex that binds DNA with high specificity (Calvenzani2012Interactions).

NFYB also interacts with the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and is involved in multiprotein complexes such as TFIID. It can associate with holo-TFIID, a complex involved in transcription initiation, even in the absence of NF-YA (Bellorini1997CCAAT). The interaction between NFYB and TBP is mediated by specific domains adjacent to their histone fold motifs, which are crucial for binding (Bellorini1997CCAAT).

In addition to its role in transcriptional activation, NFYB can interact with histone H3-H4 tetramers, suggesting a role in chromatin organization. This interaction is mediated by the histone fold motifs and is distinct from its association with H2A-H2B (Caretti1999NFY). These interactions highlight NFYB's role in both transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling.
