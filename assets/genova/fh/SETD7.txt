# SETD7

## Overview
SETD7 is a gene that encodes the protein SET domain containing 7, a histone lysine methyltransferase. This enzyme is characterized by its SET domain, which is crucial for its catalytic activity. SETD7 is involved in the methylation of both histone and non-histone proteins, playing a significant role in the regulation of gene expression, cell cycle progression, and cellular differentiation. The protein primarily methylates histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4), a modification associated with transcriptional activation, and also targets various non-histone proteins, influencing their stability and function. SETD7's activity is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and is implicated in several biological processes, including oxidative stress responses and hormone receptor signaling. Alterations in SETD7 expression or function have been linked to various diseases, particularly cancer, where it may act as a tumor suppressor or promoter depending on the context (Batista2018Biological; Daks2021p53Independent; He2015Lysine).

## Structure
SETD7 is a histone lysine methyltransferase characterized by its SET domain, which is essential for its enzymatic activity. The primary structure of SETD7 includes a series of MORN (Membrane Occupation and Recognition Nexus) repeats, each consisting of two conserved β-strands and a loop enriched with acidic amino acids. These MORN repeats form a negatively charged concave surface, facilitating interactions with positively charged domains of certain transcription factors (Liu2019Substrate).

The secondary structure of SETD7 features alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its compact tertiary structure typical of SET domain proteins. This structure is crucial for substrate binding and catalytic function. The MORN repeats are physically coupled to the catalytic SET domain, potentially serving as a substrate docking site, which may influence substrate specificity and methylation efficiency (Liu2019Substrate).

SETD7 may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its activity and interactions. The enzyme also exists in multiple splice variants, which may alter its function and localization. These structural features and modifications play a significant role in the regulation of SETD7's methyltransferase activity and its interaction with various substrates (Liu2019Substrate).

## Function
The SETD7 gene encodes a lysine methyltransferase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes by methylating both histone and non-histone proteins. In healthy human cells, SETD7 is involved in the regulation of gene expression, cell cycle progression, and cellular differentiation. It methylates histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4), a modification associated with transcriptional activation, which is found near enhancer binding sites and transcription start sites of actively transcribed genes (Batista2018Biological).

SETD7 also targets a variety of non-histone proteins, influencing their stability, localization, and function. For example, it methylates the androgen receptor (AR) and estrogen receptor α (ERα), enhancing their stability and transcriptional activity, which is important for cell differentiation and proliferation (Batista2018Biological; Herz2013SET). It also methylates proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, such as pRb and E2F1, affecting cell cycle checkpoints and apoptosis (Batista2018Biological).

In addition, SETD7 plays a role in oxidative stress responses by regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling and mitochondrial function. It negatively regulates the expression of mitochondrial ROS scavenger enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) and catalase (CAT), impacting cellular defense against oxidative stress (He2015Lysine). Overall, SETD7's methylation activity is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating various biological processes.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the SETD7 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), low expression of SETD7 is associated with increased cell proliferation and enhanced glycolysis, which are linked to tumor aggressiveness and poor patient survival. Conversely, high SETD7 expression correlates with better outcomes, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor by regulating energy metabolism and glycolytic pathways (Daks2021p53Independent).

SETD7 also plays a role in regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling, which is crucial in oxidative stress-related diseases. Inhibition of SETD7 can counteract oxidative stress and enhance antioxidant gene expression, indicating potential therapeutic benefits for ROS-associated conditions (He2015Lysine).

In breast and prostate cancers, SETD7 methylates hormone receptors, enhancing their transcriptional activity and promoting carcinogenesis. Its role in methylating proteins involved in the Sonic Hedgehog pathway and TGF-β signaling further implicates SETD7 in cancer progression and fibrosis (Chiang2022The).

Overall, SETD7's involvement in methylating key proteins and regulating signaling pathways highlights its significance in cancer development and progression, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Batista2018Biological).

## Interactions
SETD7, a lysine methyltransferase, participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, influencing numerous cellular processes. It methylates the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) at lysine 302, enhancing its stability and transcriptional efficiency (Subramanian2008Regulation). SETD7 also interacts with the androgen receptor (AR), increasing its transcriptional activity through methylation at lysine 630 (Batista2018Biological).

In the context of the Hippo signaling pathway, SETD7 monomethylates Yes-Associated Protein (YAP) at lysine 494, preventing its nuclear translocation and reducing transcription of YAP target genes (Batista2018Biological; Chiang2022The). It also interacts with β-catenin, promoting its degradation under oxidative stress conditions (Chiang2022The).

SETD7 methylates the nuclear NFκB-p65 subunit at lysine 37, facilitating its binding to inflammatory gene promoters, while methylation at lysines 314 and 315 promotes its degradation (Batista2018Biological). It also interacts with the transcription factor E2F1, leading to its degradation and affecting cell cycle progression (Batista2018Biological).

SETD7's interactions extend to histone proteins, where it methylates histone H3, influencing chromatin structure and gene expression (Liu2019Substrate). These interactions highlight SETD7's role in regulating transcriptional networks and cellular differentiation.
