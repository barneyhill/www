# U2AF1

## Overview
U2AF1 is a gene that encodes the U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 1, a protein integral to the spliceosome, a complex responsible for pre-mRNA splicing. This protein is categorized as a spliceosomal component and plays a pivotal role in recognizing the 3' splice site of pre-mRNA, facilitating the accurate removal of introns and joining of exons during mRNA processing (Loerch2016Unmasking; Yoshida2020Elucidation). U2AF1 forms a heterodimer with U2AF2, and its function is critical for the recruitment of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex to the splice site, ensuring proper mRNA maturation (Fei2016Wildtype). Mutations in U2AF1, such as S34F/Y, are associated with aberrant splicing patterns and have been implicated in various hematological malignancies, including myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia, highlighting its clinical significance (Ilagan2014U2AF1; Nian2023U2AF1).

## Structure
The U2AF1 protein, also known as U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 1, is a crucial component of the spliceosomal complex involved in RNA splicing. It is part of the U2AF heterodimer, which includes U2AF2 (U2AF65), and plays a significant role in recognizing the 3′ splice site (3′SS) of pre-mRNA (Loerch2016Unmasking; Yoshida2020Elucidation). 

U2AF1 contains two zinc finger motifs, ZF1 and ZF2, and a U2AF homology motif (UHM), which is structurally similar to RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) but is adapted for protein-protein interactions (Loerch2016Unmasking; Yoshida2020Elucidation). The zinc fingers are essential for RNA binding, with ZF1 playing a critical role in recognizing the AG dinucleotide at the 3′SS (Yoshida2020Elucidation). The UHM domain facilitates interactions with U2AF2, forming a heterodimer that is crucial for splice site recognition (Loerch2016Unmasking).

Mutations in U2AF1, such as S34F/Y, can alter its RNA binding specificity, leading to aberrant splicing patterns associated with diseases like myelodysplastic syndromes and lung adenocarcinomas (Ilagan2014U2AF1; Yoshida2020Elucidation). These mutations affect the protein's ability to discriminate between different splice site sequences, impacting its function in splicing (Yoshida2020Elucidation).

## Function
The U2AF1 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the spliceosome, specifically involved in the recognition of the 3' splice site during pre-mRNA splicing. This protein plays a vital role in RNA splicing by facilitating the recruitment of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex to the 3' splice site, which is essential for proper mRNA processing (Fei2016Wildtype). U2AF1 recognizes sequences at the 3' ends of introns, contacting the AG dinucleotide at the intron-exon boundary, which is crucial for accurate RNA splicing (Fei2016Wildtype).

In healthy human cells, U2AF1 is essential for maintaining normal splicing functions and cell survival. The wild-type U2AF1 protein is required for proper splicing and antagonizes the splicing program characteristic of U2AF1-mutant tumors, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions (Fei2016Wildtype). U2AF1 is active in the nucleus, where it influences alternative splicing, impacting various cellular processes and organismal development (Fei2016Wildtype). Its role in splicing is crucial for the proper function and survival of cells, as demonstrated by the fact that cells require the wild-type version of U2AF1 for growth and viability (Fei2016Wildtype).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the U2AF1 gene are implicated in various hematological malignancies, particularly myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These mutations, especially at hotspots S34 and Q157, lead to altered RNA splicing, which can result in aberrant exon inclusion and disrupted cellular differentiation processes. This contributes to the pathogenesis of MDS and AML by affecting genes involved in key biological pathways, such as DNMT3A, DNMT3B, and ASXL1, which are common mutational targets in these diseases (Ilagan2014U2AF1; Nian2023U2AF1).

U2AF1 mutations are associated with poor prognosis in MDS, particularly in younger patients, and are linked to shorter time-to-leukemia transformation (Wu2013Clinical). These mutations are also found in other malignancies, including primary myelofibrosis, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and various solid tumors, with varying mutation sites and associated genes (Nian2023U2AF1).

The U2AF1 S34F mutation, in particular, has been shown to impair erythroid differentiation and skew granulomonocytic differentiation towards granulocytes, indicating its role in altering hematopoiesis (Yip2017The). Targeted therapies, such as small-molecule inhibitors and IRAK4 inhibitors, are being investigated to address the splicing alterations caused by U2AF1 mutations (Nian2023U2AF1).

## Interactions
U2AF1, also known as U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 1, is a critical component of the spliceosome, engaging in several protein-protein interactions essential for pre-mRNA splicing. U2AF1 forms a heterodimer with U2AF2 (U2AF65), which is crucial for recognizing the 3' splice site in pre-mRNA. This interaction is mediated through the U2AF homology motif (UHM) of U2AF1 binding to a tryptophan-containing region of U2AF2, forming a complex that is vital for spliceosome assembly (Loerch2016Unmasking; Kielkopf2004U2AF).

The UHM domain of U2AF1 is structurally similar to RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) but is specialized for protein-protein interactions rather than RNA binding. This domain interacts with U2AF ligand motifs (ULMs) in other proteins, such as SF1, facilitating the formation of a ternary complex that includes U2AF1, U2AF2, and SF1, which is essential for spliceosome function (Loerch2016Unmasking; Kielkopf2004U2AF).

Mutations in U2AF1, particularly at residues S34 and Q157, can alter its interaction with RNA and other proteins, affecting splice site recognition and contributing to diseases like myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (Yuan2023Profiling; Ilagan2014U2AF1). These mutations can lead to changes in splicing activities, impacting various cellular pathways (Ilagan2014U2AF1).
