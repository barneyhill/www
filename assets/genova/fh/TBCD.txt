# TBCD

## Overview
The TBCD gene encodes the tubulin folding cofactor D, a crucial protein involved in the proper folding and assembly of tubulin monomers into microtubules, which are essential components of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton. As a tubulin-specific chaperone, TBCD plays a significant role in maintaining microtubule dynamics, which are vital for cellular processes such as cell division, intracellular transport, and structural integrity. The protein is characterized by several structural domains, including HEAT and armadillo repeats, which facilitate its interaction with tubulin and other cofactors, forming complexes that regulate microtubule dynamics (mariano2020functional; Nithianantham2015Tubulin). TBCD's function is critical for the regulation of microtubule polymerization and depolymerization, working in concert with other chaperones and the GTPase ARL2 to ensure proper mitotic spindle assembly and centriole biogenesis (Muto2023CRISPRCas9; mariano2020functional). Mutations in the TBCD gene have been linked to various neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining neuronal health (Chen2021Novel; mariano2020functional).

## Structure
The TBCD protein is a tubulin-specific chaperone involved in the folding and assembly of tubulin monomers into microtubules. It is a 133 kDa protein characterized by a conserved stretch of 288 amino acids between residues 254 and 541, which is critical for its function (mariano2020functional). The secondary structure of TBCD predominantly consists of α-helices, with five β-strands interspersed among 57 α-helix regions (mariano2020functional). 

TBCD contains several structural domains, including a TFCD_C domain located approximately between residues 901 to 1087, and HEAT repeats identified between residues 361 to 398, 557 to 594, and 596 to 632 (mariano2020functional). The protein also features an armadillo repeat within residues 350 to 819 (mariano2020functional). These domains are involved in the protein's interaction with tubulin and other cofactors, forming a complex that regulates microtubule dynamics (Nithianantham2015Tubulin).

The TBCD protein is part of a larger complex with TBCE and Arl2, forming a cage-like structure that regulates the soluble αβ-tubulin pool (Nithianantham2015Tubulin). This complex is crucial for the proper folding and assembly of tubulin into microtubules (mariano2020functional).

## Function
The TBCD gene encodes a protein that is integral to the assembly and regulation of microtubules, which are essential components of the cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells. TBCD functions as a chaperone, facilitating the proper folding and assembly of α/β-tubulin heterodimers, the building blocks of microtubules. This process is crucial for maintaining microtubule dynamics, which are vital for various cellular functions, including cell division, intracellular transport, and maintaining cell structure (Tian2010Effect; mariano2020functional).

In healthy human cells, TBCD is involved in the regulation of microtubule polymerization and depolymerization, working in concert with other chaperones such as TBCA, TBCB, TBCC, and TBCE, as well as the GTPase ARL2. This regulation ensures proper mitotic spindle assembly and centriole biogenesis, which are critical for cell cycle progression and neurodifferentiation (Muto2023CRISPRCas9; mariano2020functional).

TBCD is active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with β-tubulin and ARL2 to form a complex that stabilizes the tubulin structure, promoting its interaction with α-tubulin. This interaction is essential for the formation of a polymerization-competent α/β heterodimer, which is necessary for microtubule integrity and function (Tian2010Effect; mariano2020functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TBCD gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. One notable condition linked to TBCD mutations is Progressive Encephalopathy with Brain Atrophy and Thin Corpus Callosum (PEBAT), characterized by early-onset progressive encephalopathy, developmental delay, microcephaly, hypotonia, and epilepsy (mariano2020functional). TBCD mutations can lead to disorganized mitotic spindles and impaired microtubule dynamics, affecting neuronal development and function (Chen2021Novel; mariano2020functional).

The clinical manifestations of TBCD-related disorders vary widely, with some patients experiencing severe neurodegenerative phenotypes, including neurodevelopmental regression, epilepsy, and hypotonia (Chen2021Novel). In some populations, specific variants like N1033K are more prevalent and linked to severe clinical outcomes (mariano2020functional). Additionally, TBCD mutations have been implicated in conditions such as Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome, primary microcephaly, and possibly schizophrenia (mariano2020functional).

Functional studies have shown that TBCD mutations can alter protein conformation and interactions, making the protein more susceptible to degradation, which contributes to the observed clinical phenotypes (Chen2021Novel). These findings underscore the importance of TBCD in maintaining neuronal health and highlight the potential for targeted therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
TBCD, or tubulin folding cofactor D, is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins, primarily in the context of microtubule dynamics and tubulin folding. TBCD forms a trimeric complex with the regulatory GTPase ARL2 and β-tubulin, which is essential for maintaining the microtubule network. This complex plays a significant role in the regulation of microtubule dynamics, which is crucial for cell viability and division (Francis2017Nucleotide; Francis2017A).

TBCD interacts with ARL2, a small GTPase, which regulates the conformational changes in β-tubulin through nucleotide cycling. This interaction is crucial for the proper folding and assembly of tubulin heterodimers (Francis2017Nucleotide). The binding of GTP to ARL2 in the TBCD∙ARL2∙β-tubulin complex induces allosteric changes, stabilizing β-tubulin and promoting its folding into a native state (Francis2017Nucleotide).

TBCD can also bind to αβ-tubulin dimers, forming a TBCD-α-tubulin-β-tubulin trimer, although this trimer is not stable as a monodisperse species. The presence of ARL2 does not affect the stability of this trimer, suggesting that TBCD can bind tubulin dimers in both dimeric and polymerized states (Francis2017A). Additionally, TBCD interacts with other tubulin-specific chaperones, such as TBCE, forming a complex that regulates the soluble αβ-tubulin pool for microtubule dynamics (Nithianantham2015Tubulin).
