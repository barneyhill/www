# FFAR1

## Overview
The FFAR1 gene encodes the free fatty acid receptor 1, a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) also known as GPR40. This receptor is predominantly expressed in pancreatic β cells and plays a pivotal role in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) by binding medium-chain and long-chain free fatty acids. As a member of the GPCR family, FFAR1 is characterized by a seven-transmembrane helical structure, which facilitates its interaction with various ligands and signaling pathways. The receptor's activation enhances insulin secretion in response to glucose, thereby contributing to glucose homeostasis and energy metabolism. FFAR1 is also expressed in intestinal endocrine cells, where it influences the secretion of incretin hormones, further modulating insulin levels. Due to its significant role in metabolic processes, FFAR1 is considered a potential therapeutic target for metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes (Kimura2020Free; Ichimura2014Free).

## Structure
The human FFAR1, also known as GPR40, is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a seven-transmembrane helical structure typical of GPCRs. The receptor binds long-chain free fatty acids, which enhance glucose-dependent insulin secretion. The high-resolution crystal structure of FFAR1 reveals that the receptor's seven-transmembrane helical bundle is conserved, with TAK-875 binding to a non-canonical site between transmembrane helices 3-5 and the extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) regions (Srivastava2014High-resolution). ECL2 forms a b-sheet-like region stabilized by interactions with transmembrane helices, limiting its mobility (Srivastava2014High-resolution).

The receptor's binding pocket involves a charge network, with key residues such as Arg 183, Arg 258, Tyr 91, and Tyr 240 stabilizing the carboxylate moiety of TAK-875 (Srivastava2014High-resolution). The receptor's flexibility is noted due to the absence of a conserved proline in transmembrane helix 4, replaced by glycine, which may affect its conformation (Srivastava2014High-resolution). The receptor can couple with multiple G protein families, including Gq/11, influencing downstream signaling pathways (Zhang2023Structural). The receptor's structure and binding dynamics suggest potential for multiple ligand interactions, although specific details on primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures are not provided in the context.

## Function
FFAR1, also known as GPR40, is a G-protein-coupled receptor primarily expressed in pancreatic β cells, where it plays a crucial role in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). This receptor is activated by medium-chain and long-chain fatty acids (MCFAs and LCFAs), which enhance insulin secretion in response to glucose, thereby maintaining glucose homeostasis (Kimura2020Free; Ichimura2014Free). FFAR1 activation leads to increased intracellular calcium levels through the activation of phospholipase C (PLC) and subsequent phosphorylation of protein kinase C (PKC), which are key steps in the insulin secretion pathway (Kimura2020Free).

In addition to its role in pancreatic β cells, FFAR1 is expressed in intestinal endocrine cells, such as L and K cells, which secrete incretin hormones like glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). These hormones further modulate insulin secretion, indicating that FFAR1 has both direct and indirect roles in regulating insulin levels (Ichimura2014Free). FFAR1 is also involved in the regulation of cholecystokinin (CCK) secretion in I cells, contributing to energy homeostasis and glucose regulation (Kimura2020Free). The receptor's function is critical in energy metabolism, making it a potential target for treating metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes (Kimura2020Free).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the FFAR1 gene, also known as GPR40, have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes and obesity. FFAR1 is primarily expressed in pancreatic β cells, where it plays a crucial role in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Overexpression of FFAR1 in β cells can lead to improved insulin secretion and glucose tolerance in models of obesity-associated diabetes, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Ichimura2014Free). However, chronic activation of FFAR1 by elevated free fatty acids (FFAs) can impair insulin secretion, contributing to the development of diabetes (Steneberg2005The).

Genetic polymorphisms in FFAR1, such as Arg211His, Gly180Ser, and Asp175Asn, have been studied for their effects on insulin secretion and receptor function. The Gly180Ser variant is associated with reduced insulin secretion in obese individuals, while Asp175Asn has been reported to inhibit receptor function in vitro (Ichimura2016Polymorphic). These genetic variations can modulate the relationship between FFAs and insulin secretion, impacting metabolic health. The development of FFAR1 agonists, such as TAK-875, aimed to enhance GSIS and improve glucose regulation, although clinical trials were discontinued due to liver toxicity concerns (Ichimura2014Free).

## Interactions
FFAR1, also known as GPR40, is a G-protein-coupled receptor that interacts with various proteins and ligands, playing a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. FFAR1 is activated by long-chain fatty acids and synthetic agonists, such as TAK875 and GW9508, which modulate its activity in different tissues. In the pancreas, FFAR1 activation stimulates insulin secretion through interactions with the Gαq/11 subunit and β-Arrestin2 signaling pathways (Falomir-Lockhart2019Fatty). 

In human airway smooth muscle cells, FFAR1 agonists attenuate myosin light chain phosphorylation, suggesting an interaction with myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) that leads to bronchodilation, independent of the β2 adrenergic receptor-cAMP pathway (Xu2020FFAR1). FFAR1 also interacts with signaling pathways involving MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt, although these interactions do not appear to have mitogenic effects in human airway smooth muscle cells (Xu2020FFAR1).

In the central nervous system, FFAR1 is linked to neurogenesis and cognitive functions through pathways involving CREB phosphorylation and possibly Erk, indicating its role in brain development and neuronal differentiation (Falomir-Lockhart2019Fatty). FFAR1's interactions with proteins like CREB and G-proteins highlight its multifaceted role in cellular signaling.
