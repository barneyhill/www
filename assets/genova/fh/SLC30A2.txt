# SLC30A2

## Overview
The SLC30A2 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 30 member 2, commonly known as ZnT2, which is a crucial zinc transporter involved in maintaining zinc homeostasis within human cells. ZnT2 is categorized as a transmembrane protein, characterized by its six transmembrane domains and its ability to form dimers, which are essential for its function in transporting zinc ions across cellular membranes (Alam2015Exome; Lee2018A). This protein plays a significant role in the secretion of zinc into breast milk, thereby ensuring adequate zinc supply for infant development (Lee2015Essential). Mutations in the SLC30A2 gene can lead to conditions such as transient neonatal zinc deficiency, highlighting the gene's importance in zinc transport and homeostasis (Lasry2012A; Li2020A).

## Structure
The SLC30A2 gene encodes the ZnT2 protein, which is a zinc transporter involved in zinc homeostasis. ZnT2 is characterized by its structure, which includes six transmembrane domains with both N- and C-termini located on the cytoplasmic side (Alam2015Exome; Lee2018A). This arrangement facilitates the transport of zinc ions across cellular membranes. The protein functions as a dimer, either as a homo- or heterodimer, to import zinc into vesicles and mitochondria within mammary epithelial cells (Alam2015Exome; Kelleher2019Milkderived).

The ZnT2 protein is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its localization and function. For instance, the T288S variant leads to hyperphosphorylation, resulting in mislocalization to the endoplasmic reticulum and lysosomes, and is associated with increased zinc accumulation and oxidative stress (Lee2018A). The molecular structure of ZnT2, including its transmembrane domains and cytoplasmic termini, is crucial for its role in zinc transport and secretion (Alam2015Exome). The protein's structure and function are essential for maintaining adequate zinc levels in breast milk, and mutations in SLC30A2 can lead to zinc deficiency in infants (Itsumura2013Compound).

## Function
The SLC30A2 gene encodes the zinc transporter protein ZnT2, which plays a critical role in zinc homeostasis within human cells. ZnT2 functions as a proton-coupled vesicular antiporter, facilitating the transport of zinc ions from the cytoplasm into intracellular vesicles, such as lysosomes and secretory vesicles, with a stoichiometry of two protons per zinc ion (Golan2019ZnT2). This process is essential for maintaining zinc levels necessary for various physiological processes, including nucleic acid metabolism, gene expression regulation, and immune function (Golan2019ZnT2).

In mammary epithelial cells, ZnT2 is crucial for the secretion of zinc into breast milk, ensuring adequate zinc supply for infant development (Lasry2012A; Lee2015Essential). ZnT2 interacts with vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) to maintain vesicle acidification, which is vital for proper vesicle function and secretion (Lee2017Zinc). The protein's activity is particularly important during lactation, where it is upregulated to meet the increased demand for zinc transport into milk (Golan2019ZnT2). Mutations in SLC30A2 can lead to transient neonatal zinc deficiency, highlighting its importance in zinc transport and homeostasis (Lasry2012A; Li2020A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC30A2 gene, which encodes the zinc transporter ZnT2, are clinically significant as they can lead to transient neonatal zinc deficiency (TNZD). This condition occurs in breastfed infants due to low zinc levels in breast milk, resulting from mutations that impair the zinc transport function of ZnT2. Notable mutations include G87R, which causes mislocalization and impaired zinc transport, leading to zinc-deficient milk and subsequent zinc deficiency in infants (Lasry2012A). The G87R mutation acts as a dominant negative, affecting the function of the wild-type ZnT2 protein (Lasry2012A).

Other mutations, such as T288S, are associated with low milk zinc concentrations and breast dysfunction, characterized by increased sodium levels in milk and impaired tight junctions in mammary epithelial cells (Alam2015Exome; Lee2018A). These mutations can lead to severe zinc deficiency in infants, manifesting as immunoinsufficiency, cognitive delays, and growth faltering (Lee2018A). The clinical significance of these mutations underscores the importance of genetic screening and potential dietary interventions to manage TNZD in affected families (Lasry2012A).

## Interactions
The SLC30A2 gene encodes the zinc transporter protein ZnT2, which is involved in zinc homeostasis by facilitating zinc efflux into vesicles. ZnT2 forms homodimers, a process crucial for its function, and this dimerization is influenced by a conserved motif (FGWQRAE) containing residues such as Gly-135, Arg-138, and Glu-140, which are important for protein-protein interactions (Lasry2012A). Mutations in ZnT2, such as G87R, can lead to mislocalization and impaired zinc transport by interacting with the wild-type protein, destabilizing it, and reducing its levels (Lasry2012A). 

ZnT2 also interacts with other proteins in the context of zinc transport. For instance, the S296L mutation in ZnT2 results in protein destabilization and degradation, affecting its ability to transport zinc effectively (Itsumura2013Compound). The W152R mutation fails to form functional dimer complexes, highlighting the importance of protein interactions for zinc transport activity (Itsumura2013Compound). These interactions and mutations can significantly impact zinc levels in breast milk, contributing to conditions like transient neonatal zinc deficiency (Itsumura2016Novel).
