# C12orf60

## Overview
C12orf60 is a gene located on chromosome 12 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 12 open reading frame 60. This protein is currently not well-characterized in terms of its specific biological function or classification into a known protein family, such as kinases or receptors. However, emerging research suggests that C12orf60 may play a role in various physiological and pathological processes. Genetic studies have linked C12orf60 to conditions such as low grip strength in older adults and osteoarthritis, although its role appears to be indirect (Jones2020Genomewide). Additionally, C12orf60 has been implicated in the context of high-functioning autism spectrum disorder, where it may influence pre-mRNA splicing and protein phosphatase I activity (Sharma2024Statistical). Despite these associations, the precise biological functions and mechanisms of action of the C12orf60 protein remain to be elucidated, necessitating further research to fully understand its significance (den2017Genomewide).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the C12orf60 gene is not fully understood, but it has been implicated in several conditions through genetic studies. C12orf60 has been associated with low grip strength in older adults, a measure of muscle weakness, and is in linkage disequilibrium with variants associated with osteoarthritis. This suggests a potential indirect role in osteoarthritis, as five of the fifteen genomic risk loci for low grip strength, including C12orf60, have been previously linked to this condition (Jones2020Genomewide).

In the context of high-functioning autism spectrum disorder (HF-ASD), C12orf60 was mentioned alongside WBP11 for its role in activating pre-mRNA splicing and potentially inhibiting protein phosphatase I activity. This highlights its potential as an epigenetic biomarker for HF-ASD, although specific diseases directly associated with C12orf60 mutations or expression changes were not detailed (Sharma2024Statistical).

Despite its inclusion in studies related to osteoarthritis of the hand, C12orf60 was not found to have significant expression changes in affected cartilage, indicating that its role in osteoarthritis may not be direct (den2017Genomewide). Further research is needed to clarify the gene's clinical significance and its involvement in disease pathways.
