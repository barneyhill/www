# FAM240B

## Overview
FAM240B is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 240 member B. This protein is categorized as a non-enzymatic protein, and its precise biological functions are still under investigation. The gene has been implicated in various biological processes and disease states, including neurodegenerative diseases and metabolic conditions. Notably, FAM240B is associated with genetic variations linked to late-onset Alzheimer's disease and fasting plasma glucose levels, suggesting its potential role in neurodegeneration and glucose metabolism (Clarke2024Rummagene:; He2021Identification). Additionally, FAM240B may play a role in genomic stability, as evidenced by its association with copy number variations in response to ionizing radiation (Ogura2021Increased). Despite these associations, further research is needed to fully elucidate the functional roles of FAM240B and its encoded protein.

## Clinical Significance
FAM240B has been implicated in several conditions through its association with genetic variations and expression patterns. In the context of Alzheimer's Disease, FAM240B is part of an intergenic region, ANKRD18A-FAM240B, which has suggestive associations with late-onset Alzheimer's disease according to the GWAS catalog (He2021Identification). This suggests a potential role in neurodegenerative processes, although the exact mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated.

In another study, FAM240B was identified among genes associated with copy number variations (CNVs) in the offspring of male mice exposed to low dose-rate ionizing radiation. This study found a significant increase in de novo deletions in the irradiated group, indicating that FAM240B may be involved in genomic instability or susceptibility to radiation-induced genetic changes (Ogura2021Increased).

Additionally, FAM240B is listed among the top genes associated with the 'Fasting Plasma Glucose' phenotype in the GWAS Catalog, suggesting a potential link to metabolic conditions or glucose regulation (Clarke2023Rummagene:; Clarke2024Rummagene:). These associations highlight the gene's potential involvement in diverse biological processes and disease states.
