# SLC7A6

## Overview
The SLC7A6 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 7 member 6, which is a transmembrane protein involved in the transport of amino acids across cell membranes. This protein is a component of the heteromeric amino acid transporter system y+LAT-2, which facilitates the transport of both cationic and neutral amino acids. SLC7A6 is expressed in various tissues, including the small intestine and kidney, where it plays a significant role in amino acid homeostasis, particularly in the transport and release of arginine, an essential amino acid. The protein's function is crucial for maintaining cellular nutrient balance, impacting processes such as cell growth and metabolism. Despite its broad expression, SLC7A6 has a specific role in amino acid transport that is not fully compensated by other similar transport systems, underscoring its importance in cellular function (Sperandeo2007Slc7a7; Sperandeo2007Lysinuric; Closs2006Structure).

## Function
The SLC7A6 gene encodes a protein that is part of the solute carrier family 7, specifically involved in the transport of cationic amino acids across cell membranes. This protein functions as a light subunit of the heteromeric amino acid transporter system, known as y+LAT-2, which is involved in the transport of both cationic and neutral amino acids (Closs2006Structure). SLC7A6 is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, including the small intestine and kidney, where it likely plays a role in releasing arginine, an essential amino acid for numerous metabolic processes (Sperandeo2007Lysinuric).

In the context of cellular biology, SLC7A6 contributes to maintaining amino acid balance within cells, which is crucial for cellular nutrient uptake and homeostasis. This balance impacts processes such as cell growth and metabolism, highlighting the gene's importance in overall cellular function (Sperandeo2007Slc7a7). Despite its widespread expression, SLC7A6's role in compensating for disruptions in similar transport systems, such as those caused by mutations in the SLC7A7 gene, appears limited, suggesting a specific yet critical function in amino acid transport (Sperandeo2007Slc7a7).
