# RNF144A

## Overview
RNF144A is a gene that encodes the protein ring finger protein 144A, which functions as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase. This protein is characterized by its RING finger domain, a hallmark of the RBR (RING1-IBR-RING2) family of E3 ligases, which facilitates its role in the ubiquitination process. The RING finger protein 144A is involved in various cellular processes, including protein degradation, apoptosis, DNA repair, and cell cycle regulation, by tagging specific proteins for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. It is known to interact with key proteins such as DNA-PKcs and VRK3, influencing cellular responses to stress and maintaining genome integrity. Additionally, RNF144A plays a significant role in immune signaling, particularly in the JAK-STAT5 pathway, and has been implicated in cancer biology, where its expression levels can affect tumor progression and immune evasion (Afzali2019RNF144A; Ho2014RNF144A).

## Structure
RNF144A is a human gene encoding an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase characterized by its RING finger domain, which is crucial for its ubiquitination function. The protein contains a RING1-IBR-RING2 (RBR) domain architecture, which is typical of the RBR family of E3 ligases. This structure includes a typical N-terminal RING finger domain (RING1), an 'in-between RING' (IBR) domain, and a structurally unique C-terminal RING2 domain (Zhang2022RNF144A; Yang2019RNF144A). The RING domain of RNF144A binds two zinc atoms, facilitated by a cross-braced motif common in RING finger domains, coordinating zinc atoms with cysteine and histidine ligands (Miyamoto2020Solution).

RNF144A also contains a potential single transmembrane domain, which influences its subcellular localization and is crucial for its full E3 ligase activity (Ho2014RNF144A). The protein's E3 ligase activity involves a RING/HECT hybrid mechanism for ubiquitin transfer, allowing it to interact with E2-conjugating enzymes through its RING1 domain (Ho2014RNF144A; Zhang2022RNF144A). RNF144A's activity is regulated by post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination, which is essential for its function in targeting proteins like DNA-PKcs and HSPA2 for degradation (Ho2014RNF144A; Yang2019RNF144A).

## Function
RNF144A is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a significant role in protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. It is involved in the regulation of apoptosis, DNA repair, and cell cycle progression by tagging specific proteins for degradation. In healthy human cells, RNF144A is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing cellular homeostasis and stress responses (Ho2014RNF144A).

RNF144A interacts with DNA-PKcs, a key protein in the DNA damage response, promoting its ubiquitination and degradation. This activity is crucial for shifting cell fate from survival to apoptosis when DNA damage is severe, thereby maintaining genome integrity (Ho2014RNF144A). RNF144A is also involved in the regulation of ERK signaling by degrading VRK3, a negative regulator of this pathway, particularly under oxidative stress conditions. This regulation enhances ERK-mediated apoptosis, highlighting RNF144A's role in modulating cellular responses to stress (Han2020RNF144a).

In the immune system, RNF144A enhances JAK-STAT5 activation by promoting the interaction of STAT5 with IL-2Rb, which is essential for effective immune responses. This function underscores its importance in maintaining proper immune signaling and function (Afzali2019RNF144A).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RNF144A gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. In breast cancer, RNF144A functions as a tumor suppressor by promoting the degradation of oncogenic proteins such as HSPA2 and YY1. Low expression of RNF144A is associated with larger tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and higher clinical stage, leading to poorer overall survival and disease-free survival outcomes (Zhang2022RNF144A; Yang2019RNF144A). RNF144A is often downregulated in breast tumors, with its expression levels varying among different breast cancer subtypes (Yang2019RNF144A).

In bladder cancer, RNF144A deficiency is linked to increased tumorigenesis and immune evasion. It promotes the degradation of proteins like PD-L1, DNA-PKcs, and BMI1, which are involved in tumor progression and immune checkpoint regulation. RNF144A deficiency results in higher PD-L1 levels, reducing CD8+ T cell infiltration and promoting tumor growth (Ho2021RNF144A).

RNF144A also plays a role in immune regulation, particularly in cytokine signaling pathways. Its dysregulation can lead to enhanced ERK activation, contributing to disease severity in conditions like influenza (Afzali2019RNF144A). These findings highlight RNF144A's potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in various cancers and immune-related conditions.

## Interactions
RNF144A, a member of the RING-in-between-RING family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, participates in several protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. It interacts with DNA-dependent protein kinase, catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), a key player in the DNA damage response. RNF144A promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of DNA-PKcs, which is crucial for apoptosis during DNA damage (Ho2014RNF144A). This interaction primarily occurs in the cytoplasm, where RNF144A targets cytosolic DNA-PKcs for degradation (Ho2014RNF144A).

RNF144A also interacts with the transcription factor YY1 in breast cancer cells, promoting its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. This interaction leads to the downregulation of glial maturation factor γ (GMFG) expression, as YY1 is responsible for activating GMFG transcription (Zhang2022RNF144A).

In epithelial ovarian cancer, RNF144A interacts with LIN28B, facilitating its degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This interaction affects the expression of stem cell markers and is associated with the suppression of ovarian cancer stem cell properties and tumor progression (Li2021RNF144A). These interactions highlight RNF144A's role in regulating protein stability and cellular responses to stress.
