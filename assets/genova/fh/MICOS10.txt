# MICOS10

## Overview
MICOS10 is a gene that encodes the protein mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system subunit 10, commonly referred to as Mic10. Mic10 is a transmembrane protein that serves as a core component of the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS), which is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of mitochondrial cristae. The protein plays a pivotal role in the organization and stabilization of the mitochondrial inner membrane, particularly at crista junctions, by facilitating membrane curvature through its oligomerization. This process is supported by conserved glycine-rich motifs within Mic10, which form a scaffold essential for cristae architecture (Wollweber2017Mitochondrial; Rampelt2017Mic10). Additionally, Mic10 interacts with the F1Fo-ATP synthase, contributing to the formation and stabilization of ATP synthase oligomers, thereby influencing mitochondrial function and cellular energy production (Rampelt2017Mic10). The integrity of Mic10 is vital for proper mitochondrial function, and its disruption can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, highlighting its importance in cellular and organismal energy metabolism (Wollweber2017Mitochondrial; Eramo2019The).

## Function
The MICOS10 gene encodes the Mic10 protein, a core component of the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS), which is essential for maintaining the architecture of mitochondrial cristae. Mic10 is involved in the organization of the mitochondrial inner membrane, particularly at crista junctions, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing membrane curvature. This stabilization is achieved through the oligomerization of Mic10, facilitated by its conserved glycine-rich motifs, which form a scaffold that supports the structure of cristae junctions (Wollweber2017Mitochondrial; Rampelt2017Mic10).

Mic10's interaction with the dimeric F1Fo-ATP synthase is significant for the formation and stabilization of ATP synthase oligomers, which are essential for efficient ATP production. This interaction highlights a functional crosstalk between MICOS and the ATP synthase, influencing the structure of the mitochondrial inner membrane (Rampelt2017Mic10). The presence of Mic10 is crucial for maintaining the proper architecture of cristae, which is vital for mitochondrial function and cellular energy production (Eramo2019The). The disruption of Mic10 can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, underscoring its importance in cellular and organismal energy metabolism (Wollweber2017Mitochondrial).

## Interactions
Mic10, a core subunit of the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS), plays a crucial role in mitochondrial architecture through its interactions with various proteins. Mic10 is known to oligomerize independently, primarily through its intrinsic glycine-rich motifs, which facilitate the stable association of transmembrane helices (Bohnert2015Central). It forms a subcomplex with other MICOS components, including Mic12, Mic26, and Mic27, with Mic26 and Mic27 influencing its oligomeric state (Mukherjee2021MICOS). 

Mic10 interacts with the F1Fo-ATP synthase, particularly associating with its mature dimer, which is necessary for the formation and stabilization of larger ATP synthase oligomers (Rampelt2017Mic10). This interaction is significant for cristae formation and is maintained even in the absence of Mic27, indicating that Mic10 can independently associate with the ATP synthase (Eydt2017Cristae). 

Mic10 also interacts with other MICOS subunits, such as Mic60, which is essential for MICOS stability, and Mic19, whose association with MICOS depends on Mic60 (Bohnert2015Central). These interactions highlight Mic10's central role in maintaining mitochondrial inner membrane architecture and its involvement in the structural organization of mitochondrial membranes.
