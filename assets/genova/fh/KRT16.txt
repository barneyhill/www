# KRT16

## Overview
Keratin 16 (KRT16) is a gene that encodes the type I intermediate filament protein known as keratin 16. This protein is integral to the structural integrity and function of epithelial tissues, particularly in response to stress and injury. Keratin 16 is constitutively expressed in various epithelial appendages and is notably upregulated in the epidermis during wound healing and chronic inflammation, where it aids in re-epithelialization and maintenance of the epidermal barrier (Lessard2012Keratin; Paladini1996Onset). The protein is also involved in mitochondrial organization and function within skin keratinocytes, playing a role in maintaining redox balance and preventing oxidative stress (Steen2020A). Mutations in the KRT16 gene are associated with pachyonychia congenita, a disorder characterized by nail dystrophy and painful keratoderma, highlighting its clinical significance in dermatological conditions (Zieman2019Pathophysiology; Smith2005The).

## Structure
Keratin 16 (KRT16) is a type I intermediate filament protein characterized by a central α-helical rod domain flanked by non-helical head and tail domains. This structure is essential for the formation of intermediate filaments, which provide mechanical stability to cells (Ho2022Update; Zhang2019Keratin). The α-helical rod domain is organized in a heptad repeat pattern, facilitating the formation of coiled-coil dimers, which are the basic building blocks of keratin filaments (Ho2022Update). 

In terms of tertiary structure, KRT16 assembles into intermediate filaments through interactions between heterodimers, each comprising one type I and one type II keratin protein, such as keratin 6 (Ho2022Update). The quaternary structure involves the formation of antiparallel tetramers, which are crucial for the mature intermediate filament assembly (Ho2022Update).

Post-translational modifications of KRT16 include phosphorylation, which plays a significant role in regulating its function and interactions within the cell (Knöbel2015Keratins). These modifications can influence the protein's role in cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, and response to stress (Steen2020A).

## Function
Keratin 16 (KRT16) is a type I intermediate filament protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of epithelial tissues. It is constitutively expressed in various epithelial appendages, including the tongue, hair follicles, and glabrous skin. KRT16 is particularly important in response to stressors, as it is induced in the epidermis upon wounding or chronic inflammation, aiding in the repair and maintenance of the epidermal barrier (Lessard2012Keratin).

KRT16 is involved in supporting mitochondrial organization and function in skin keratinocytes. It helps maintain mitochondrial structure and function, as evidenced by altered mitochondrial dynamics and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in keratinocytes lacking KRT16. This suggests that KRT16 plays a role in regulating mitochondrial morphology, dynamics, and function, which is crucial for maintaining redox balance and preventing oxidative stress (Steen2020A).

In the context of wound healing, KRT16 is rapidly induced at the wound edge, leading to a reorganization of keratin filaments in keratinocytes. This reorganization is associated with changes in cell shape and adhesion, promoting re-epithelialization and facilitating the wound healing process (Paladini1996Onset).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KRT16 gene are associated with pachyonychia congenita (PC), a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by nail dystrophy, oral leukokeratosis, and painful palmoplantar keratoderma (PPK) (Zieman2019Pathophysiology; Samuelov2020Revisiting). PC is divided into two main subtypes, PC-1 and PC-2, with KRT16 mutations specifically linked to PC-1 (Smith2005The). These mutations can lead to varying clinical presentations, influenced by the specific amino acid changes, such as p.Asn125Asp and p.Arg127Pro, which are associated with more severe phenotypes (Fu2011Genotype–Phenotype).

A novel frameshift mutation, c.25delA, in KRT16 has been identified in a Chinese family, resulting in a truncated protein and suggesting a pathogenic mechanism of haploinsufficiency (Cao2011A). KRT16 mutations are also implicated in focal non-epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma (NEPPK), characterized by hyperkeratotic lesions without nail involvement (Shamsher1995Novel).

Altered expression of KRT16 is linked to stress responses and is upregulated in certain cancers, including squamous cell carcinoma and breast cancer, indicating its role in hyperproliferative conditions (Evstafieva2018Implication). These findings underscore the clinical significance of KRT16 in various dermatological and oncological conditions.

## Interactions
KRT16 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular structure and function. It forms heterodimers with KRT6 and KRT17, which are essential for the structural integrity of epithelial cells and are involved in cellular responses to stress and injury (Ho2022Update; Zhang2019Keratin). KRT16 is also associated with mitochondrial organization and function in skin keratinocytes, where it interacts with trichoplein (TCHP), a protein significant for mitochondrial function (Steen2020A).

In the context of skin disorders, KRT16 interacts with the inactive rhomboid protease RHBDF2 (irhom2) in keratinocytes, which is implicated in conditions like tylosis with oesophageal cancer (TOC). This interaction affects cellular processes such as inflammation and oxidative stress (Zieman2019Altered). KRT16 can also localize to the nucleus and potentially influence gene expression, forming distinct puncta in the nucleus, which may be regulated by the presence of K17 (Zieman2019Altered).

These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of KRT16 in cellular processes, including its involvement in maintaining mitochondrial dynamics, influencing gene expression, and contributing to the pathogenesis of skin disorders.
