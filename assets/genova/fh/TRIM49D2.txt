# TRIM49D2

## Overview
The TRIM49D2 gene encodes the protein tripartite motif containing 49D2, which is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family. Proteins in this family are characterized by the presence of a tripartite motif, which includes a RING finger domain, one or two B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region. These structural features suggest that TRIM49D2 may function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, a type of enzyme that plays a crucial role in targeting proteins for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The specific biological functions and pathways involving TRIM49D2 remain to be fully elucidated, but its structural characteristics imply a potential role in regulating protein stability and cellular processes (Qiu2020aarFDC).
