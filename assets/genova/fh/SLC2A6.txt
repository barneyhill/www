# SLC2A6

## Overview
SLC2A6 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 2 member 6 (GLUT6), which is a member of the Class III glucose transporters within the SLC2A family. GLUT6 is a transmembrane protein characterized by 12 transmembrane segments, facilitating the transport of glucose and other monosaccharides across cell membranes (Jafri2023Molecular; Cheeseman2015Structure). The protein is primarily expressed in the brain and lymphoid tissues and plays a significant role in glucose transport, particularly in the context of metabolic reprogramming during inflammation (Maedera2018GLUT6). Although GLUT6 is not sensitive to insulin, it is involved in maintaining glucose homeostasis and has been implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including cancer progression and metabolic disorders (Zhang2022SLC2As; Chen2022Investigating).

## Structure
The SLC2A6 gene encodes the GLUT6 protein, a member of the Class III glucose transporters within the SLC2A family. GLUT6 is a 507 amino acid protein with a high sequence identity to GLUT8 (44.8%) and GLUT1 (28.5%) (Cheeseman2015Structure). The protein structure includes 12 transmembrane segments, a characteristic feature of GLUT family members, facilitating glucose transport across cell membranes (Jafri2023Molecular).

Class III GLUTs, including GLUT6, have several conserved motifs such as PESPR in TM6 and PETKGR in TM12. A notable structural feature is the absence of an N-linked glycosylation site in Loop1, with predicted glycosylation sites instead located in the long Loop9 between TM9 and TM10 (Cheeseman2015Structure). This class also lacks the QLS motif found in Class I proteins (Cheeseman2015Structure).

GLUT6 is primarily expressed in the brain and lymphoid tissues and is involved in glucose transport when reconstituted into membrane vesicles (Cheeseman2015Structure). The protein's intracellular localization is potentially influenced by a dileucine motif, which may affect its trafficking and function (Mueckler2013The). The specific tertiary and quaternary structures of SLC2A6 are not detailed in the available literature.

## Function
The SLC2A6 gene encodes the glucose transporter protein GLUT6, which is part of the facilitative glucose transporter family responsible for transporting glucose and other monosaccharides across cell membranes (Chen2022Investigating). In healthy human cells, SLC2A6 is involved in glucose transmembrane transport, dehydroascorbic acid transport, and carbohydrate import across the plasma membrane (Zhang2022SLC2As). The protein is primarily active in the apical plasma membrane, presynapse, and perinuclear region of the cytoplasm, where it facilitates the transport of glucose, dehydroascorbic acid, and fructose (Zhang2022SLC2As).

GLUT6 is notably expressed in the brain, spleen, and peripheral leukocytes, with some expression in the pancreas and heart (Chen2022Investigating). It is a lysosomal transporter that modulates glycolysis in macrophages, playing a role in the metabolic reprogramming during inflammation (Maedera2018GLUT6). Although GLUT6 is not sensitive to insulin, it has significant glucose transport activity when expressed in certain cell types (Chen2022Investigating). The protein's activity is linked to maintaining glucose homeostasis and may have implications in conditions like obesity and insulin resistance (Chen2022Investigating).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SLC2A6 gene, which encodes the glucose transporter GLUT6, have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), SLC2A6 expression is downregulated, and its reduced levels are associated with advanced tumor stages. This downregulation is partly due to hypermethylation, and SLC2A6 is involved in immune response modulation, including M2 macrophage polarization and T cell exhaustion, which are relevant to cancer progression. These findings suggest that SLC2A6 could serve as a diagnostic marker and therapeutic target in LUAD (Zhang2022SLC2As).

In the context of obesity and insulin resistance, SLC2A6 is upregulated in pancreatic islets of obese mice and correlates with body mass index in humans. Despite this upregulation, GLUT6 knockout in obese mice results in increased insulin secretion without affecting body weight or glucose tolerance, indicating a complex role in glucose metabolism and insulin regulation (Chen2022Investigating).

SLC2A6 also plays a role in myoblast differentiation, where its knockdown leads to lactate accumulation and impaired muscle differentiation. This suggests potential implications for muscle-related diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, where altered SLC2A6 expression may affect muscle function (Jiang2022Slc2a6).
