# ELL3

## Overview
ELL3 is a gene that encodes the protein elongation factor for RNA polymerase II 3, which is a member of the ELL family of RNA polymerase II elongation factors. This protein plays a pivotal role in transcription elongation by enhancing the catalytic rate of RNA polymerase II, thereby facilitating the transition from transcription initiation to elongation. ELL3 is predominantly active in the nucleus and is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of gene expression, cell proliferation, and genomic integrity. It is particularly significant in embryonic stem cells, where it marks enhancers crucial for activating developmentally regulated genes, and in B cells, where it is associated with cell proliferation and survival. ELL3's interactions with other proteins, such as RNA polymerase II, the cohesin complex, and the Super Elongation Complex, underscore its importance in transcription regulation and cellular differentiation. Additionally, ELL3 has been implicated in various cancers, including breast cancer and B cell lymphomas, due to its role in transcription elongation and its interactions with key signaling pathways (Alexander2017Selective; Miller2000Identification; Lin2013The).

## Function
ELL3 is a member of the ELL family of RNA polymerase II elongation factors, which play a crucial role in transcription elongation by enhancing the catalytic rate of RNA polymerase II. ELL3 is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it facilitates the transition from transcription initiation to elongation, thereby regulating gene expression (Miller2000Identification; Lin2013The).

In embryonic stem (ES) cells, ELL3 is involved in marking enhancers, which are critical for the activation of developmentally regulated genes. It binds to enhancers and mediates the promoter-proximal occupancy of RNA polymerase II, establishing a 'paused Pol II' state that is essential for gene activation during early embryonic development (Lin2013The). ELL3's function at enhancers requires the cohesin complex, which aids in enhancer-promoter communication (Lin2013The).

In B cells, ELL3 is expressed prior to plasma cell differentiation and is associated with cell proliferation and survival. It is crucial for maintaining genomic integrity and proper cell division, as its depletion leads to increased DNA damage and mitotic aberrations (Alexander2017Selective). ELL3's role in transcription regulation and cell cycle progression highlights its importance in cellular differentiation and development.

## Clinical Significance
ELL3 has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in transcription elongation and its interactions with key signaling pathways. In breast cancer, overexpression of ELL3 is associated with increased cell proliferation, enhanced cancer stem cell properties, and drug resistance, particularly to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). This is mediated through the MEK/ERK signaling pathway, which is crucial for promoting oncogenesis in breast cancer cells (Kim2017Ell3; Ahn2013Ell3). ELL3 also stabilizes the p53 protein in breast cancer cells, influencing their sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents like cisplatin (CDDP) (Ahn2015Ell3).

In B cell lymphomas, ELL3 is upregulated in certain types, such as Burkitt's lymphoma and diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Its depletion leads to increased DNA damage and apoptosis, indicating its importance for cell proliferation and survival in these cancers (Alexander2017Selective).

ELL3 is also involved in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where it interacts with BRD4 to regulate transcription elongation. Alterations in ELL3 expression can affect AML cell sensitivity to BET inhibitors, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zha2020Disruption).

## Interactions
ELL3 interacts with RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) to facilitate transcription elongation. It directly binds to Pol II, aiding in the alignment of the 3' terminus of the nascent transcript with the Pol II active site, which is crucial for transcription regulation (Lin2013The). ELL3 also interacts with the cohesin complex, which is necessary for enhancer-promoter communication and the stabilization of ELL3 at enhancer regions (Lin2013The).

In embryonic stem cells, ELL3 co-occupies enhancer regions with known enhancer-binding factors such as p300 and Oct4. It is associated with enhancer markers like p300 and H3K4me1, indicating its role in enhancer function (Lin2013The). ELL3 also interacts with the Super Elongation Complex (SEC), which includes components like AFF4 and P-TEFb, to facilitate gene activation during differentiation (Lin2013The).

In breast cancer cells, ELL3 physically interacts with the p53 protein, stabilizing it by blocking its proteasomal degradation. This interaction is crucial for p53 stability and function in response to DNA-damaging agents like cisplatin (Ahn2015Ell3). ELL3's interaction with p53 involves both ubiquitin-dependent and -independent pathways, affecting the MDM2-p53 feedback loop and involving proteins like NQO1 (Ahn2015Ell3).
