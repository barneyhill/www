# LTBP4

## Overview
LTBP4 (latent transforming growth factor beta binding protein 4) is a gene that encodes a multi-domain glycoprotein involved in the regulation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling and the assembly of elastic fibers within the extracellular matrix (ECM). The protein product of LTBP4 is characterized by multiple epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains and unique 8-cysteine (8-Cys) domains, which are essential for its structural and functional roles in the ECM (Todorovic2012LTBPs; Su2021LTBP4a). LTBP4 exists in two major isoforms, LTBP4L and LTBP4S, which are expressed in a tissue-specific manner and undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation (Alanazi2021Autosomal; Su2021LTBP4a). The protein plays a critical role in elastogenesis by interacting with fibulin-5 and fibrillin-1, facilitating the proper assembly of elastic fibers, and regulating TGF-β signaling by binding to latent TGF-β complexes (Su2021LTBP4; Noda2013Latent). Mutations in the LTBP4 gene are associated with various connective tissue disorders and diseases, including Autosomal Recessive Cutis Laxa type 1C and Duchenne muscular dystrophy, highlighting its clinical significance (Su2021LTBP4; Alanazi2021Autosomal).

## Structure
The latent transforming growth factor beta binding protein 4 (LTBP4) is a multi-domain glycoprotein involved in the regulation of TGF-beta signaling and elastic fiber assembly. Structurally, LTBP4 is characterized by multiple epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains and unique 8-cysteine (8-Cys) domains, which are crucial for its function in the extracellular matrix (ECM) (Todorovic2012LTBPs; Su2021LTBP4a). The protein contains four 8-Cys domains interspersed with numerous EGF-like motifs, many of which include calcium-binding sequences that may confer resistance to proteolysis (Todorovic2012LTBPs; ÖKLÜ2000The).

LTBP4 exists in two major isoforms, the long form (LTBP4L) and the short form (LTBP4S), which are encoded by variants with different N-terminal splice sites. These isoforms are expressed in a tissue-specific manner, with LTBP4L being more prominent in the liver and LTBP4S in the lung and small intestine (Kantola2010Independent; Su2021LTBP4a). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which is more prevalent in the N-terminal region (Alanazi2021Autosomal).

Mutations in LTBP4, such as C1186R, can alter its secondary structure, affecting its stability and interactions with other ECM proteins like fibrillin-1, which are essential for proper elastic fiber formation (Alanazi2021Autosomal).

## Function
LTBP4 (latent transforming growth factor beta binding protein 4) plays a crucial role in the assembly of elastic fibers, which are essential components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) responsible for tissue elasticity. In healthy human cells, LTBP4 interacts with fibulin-5, facilitating the linear deposition of elastin on microfibrils, a process known as elastogenesis (Su2021LTBP4; Noda2013Latent). This interaction is critical for preventing the formation of misplaced aggregates and ensuring the proper assembly of elastic fibers, which is vital for maintaining the structural integrity of tissues (Noda2013Latent).

LTBP4 also regulates TGF-β signaling by binding to latent TGF-β complexes, facilitating their storage in the ECM, and controlling their activation. This regulation is essential for maintaining normal tissue function and homeostasis (Su2021LTBP4). LTBP4 stabilizes TGF-β receptors on cell membranes, preventing their rapid degradation and ensuring adequate signaling, which is crucial for various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and repair (Su2021LTBP4). The protein is highly expressed in smooth and skeletal muscles, indicating its importance in muscle function and integrity (Su2021LTBP4).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the LTBP4 gene are linked to several diseases and conditions, primarily due to its role in connective tissue disorders and TGFβ signaling. Autosomal Recessive Cutis Laxa type 1C (ARCL1C), also known as Urban-Rifkin-Davis syndrome, is caused by biallelic variants in LTBP4. This condition is characterized by early childhood-onset pulmonary emphysema, peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis, inguinal hernias, and hollow-organ diverticula, resulting from disruptions in microfibril and elastic-fiber homeostasis (Su2021LTBP4; Alanazi2021Autosomal). Specific point mutations in LTBP4 affecting conserved cysteine residues lead to structural and functional changes, disrupting interactions with proteins essential for elastogenesis, such as fibrillin-1 and tropoelastin (Alanazi2021Autosomal).

In Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), LTBP4 acts as a genetic modifier. Certain haplotypes, like IAAM, are associated with delayed loss of ambulation due to altered TGFβ/SMAD signaling (Su2021LTBP4; Lamar2016GenotypeSpecific). LTBP4 is also implicated in scleroderma, a connective tissue disease characterized by systemic fibrosis, where it may serve as a biomarker for disease progression (Su2021LTBP4). Additionally, LTBP4 mutations are associated with chronic lung disease, abdominal aneurysms, and colorectal cancer, with specific alleles influencing disease severity through TGFβ signaling modulation (Lamar2016GenotypeSpecific).

## Interactions
LTBP4 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in the assembly of elastic fibers and the regulation of TGF-β signaling. It binds to fibulin-5, facilitating the deposition of tropoelastin on microfibrils, which is essential for elastic fiber assembly. This interaction is specific, involving the four-cysteine domains of LTBP4 and the C-terminal domain of fibulin-5 (Noda2013Latent). LTBP4 also interacts with fibrillin-1, contributing to the structural integrity of the extracellular matrix (Noda2013Latent).

In addition to its role in elastogenesis, LTBP4 is involved in TGF-β signaling. It binds covalently to latent TGF-β1, forming a complex that is secreted and incorporated into the extracellular matrix, which is crucial for TGF-β1 activation (Su2021LTBP4). This interaction is important for the proper activation of TGF-β, influencing various signaling pathways, including Smad signaling (Kretschmer2011Latent).

LTBP4's interactions extend to its role in angiogenesis, where it upregulates vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs) in endothelial cells, promoting angiogenesis (Su2021LTBP4a). These interactions highlight LTBP4's multifaceted role in cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target.
