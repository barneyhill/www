# NALF1

## Overview
NALF1 is a gene that encodes the NALCN channel auxiliary factor 1, a protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of ion channels. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is involved in modulating the activity of the NALCN sodium leak channel, which is essential for maintaining the resting membrane potential and neuronal excitability. The NALCN channel auxiliary factor 1 is integral to various physiological processes, including the regulation of neuronal firing and rhythmic activities in the central nervous system. Mutations or dysregulation of the NALF1 gene can have significant implications for neurological function and are associated with various clinical conditions (Qiu2020aarFDC).
