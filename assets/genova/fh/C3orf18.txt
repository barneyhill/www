# C3orf18

## Overview
C3orf18, or chromosome 3 open reading frame 18, is a gene located on the short arm of chromosome 3. It encodes a protein that is currently not well-characterized in terms of its specific biological function or classification into known protein categories such as kinases or receptors. Despite this, emerging research has highlighted its potential involvement in various biological processes and disease states. The protein encoded by C3orf18 has been implicated in genetic conditions such as Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, where its deletion may contribute to phenotypic manifestations like hyper IgE syndrome (Zechi‐Ceide2012Saethre–Chotzen). Additionally, C3orf18 has been identified as part of a prognostic gene signature in lung adenocarcinoma, suggesting its role in cancer biology (Zhao2018Twentygenebased). Furthermore, genetic variations in C3orf18 have been associated with stroke phenotypes, indicating its potential influence on vascular health and disease susceptibility (Zhao2020Integrating).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
C3orf18 has been implicated in several clinical conditions through its association with genetic alterations. In a case study of a Brazilian girl with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, a deletion involving the C3orf18 gene was identified as part of a complex chromosomal rearrangement. This deletion was suggested to contribute to the patient's hyper IgE phenotype, characterized by elevated serum immunoglobulin E levels, recurrent infections, and learning difficulties (Zechi‐Ceide2012Saethre–Chotzen).

In the context of lung adenocarcinoma (LAC), C3orf18 was identified as part of a 20-gene prognostic signature associated with overall survival. This suggests that alterations in the expression of C3orf18 may have prognostic implications in LAC, potentially serving as a biomarker for personalized treatment strategies (Zhao2018Twentygenebased).

Additionally, C3orf18 has been linked to stroke phenotypes. In a study integrating multi-omics data, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with C3orf18 were identified in a trans-ethnic dataset for large artery stroke. The gene was associated with phenotypes such as decreased homologous recombination repair frequency and upregulation of the Wnt pathway, which may influence stroke susceptibility (Zhao2020Integrating).
