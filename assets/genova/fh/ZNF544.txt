# ZNF544

## Overview
ZNF544 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 544, a member of the C2H2 zinc finger protein family, which is characterized by its role as a transcription factor. This protein is involved in the regulation of gene expression through its ability to bind specific DNA sequences, thereby influencing transcriptional activity. ZNF544 is implicated in the modulation of DNA methylation, an essential process in epigenetic regulation, and interacts with various proteins involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional repression. The protein's expression and function are context-dependent, with notable involvement in cellular stress responses and potential roles in cancer, particularly in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (Hop2020Genomewide; Martins2024A; Li2005Discrimination).

## Structure
ZNF544 is a zinc finger protein characterized by the presence of zinc finger domains, which are typically involved in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. The primary structure of ZNF544 consists of amino acid sequences that form zinc finger motifs. These motifs are crucial for the protein's function in interacting with DNA.

The secondary structure of ZNF544 may include alpha helices and beta sheets, which are common in zinc finger proteins. These structures contribute to the overall stability and functionality of the protein. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these zinc finger motifs into a stable three-dimensional conformation. This folding is often stabilized by the presence of zinc ions, which are essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the zinc finger domains.

While specific details about the quaternary structure of ZNF544 are not provided, zinc finger proteins can sometimes form complexes with other protein subunits, potentially influencing their regulatory roles. Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation or ubiquitination may occur, affecting the protein's function and stability. These modifications can play a role in regulating the activity and interactions of ZNF544 within the cell.

## Function
ZNF544 is a zinc finger protein that functions primarily as a transcription factor, playing a significant role in regulating DNA methylation levels in human cells. It is involved in the modulation of gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences, influencing the transcriptional activity of target genes. ZNF544 has been identified as one of the transcription factors that can either increase or decrease DNA methylation at their target CpG sites, suggesting its role in epigenetic regulation (Hop2020Genomewide).

The protein is part of the C2H2 zinc finger family, which often contains a KRAB domain associated with epigenetic silencing. This domain allows ZNF544 to interact with other proteins involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional repression, such as DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and TET proteins, which are crucial for maintaining DNA methylation patterns (Hop2020Genomewide).

In the context of cellular responses to environmental stress, ZNF544 expression is down-regulated in human bronchial epithelial cells upon exposure to zinc sulfate, indicating its potential involvement in cellular stress responses and metal ion regulation (Li2005Discrimination). However, the specific physiological role of ZNF544 in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF544 has been implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly in cancer. In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), a subset characterized by high expression of a cluster of coexpressed KZFP genes, including ZNF544, is associated with distinct clinical features. This subset, known as KZFP High DLBCLs, exhibits a proliferative and highly metabolic state, with upregulation of genes involved in cell-cycle regulation and DNA repair. Patients with this profile have significantly shorter survival rates compared to those with lower expression levels of these genes. The KZFP High signature, which includes ZNF544, may contribute to disease relapse by promoting clonal diversity and immune evasion, rather than primary chemoresistance. This is supported by the observed depletion of immune cells in KZFP High DLBCLs, which may facilitate the emergence of treatment-resistant subclones (Martins2024A).

In addition to its role in cancer, ZNF544 has been identified in a genome-wide analysis as a transcription factor affecting DNA methylation levels in blood. This suggests a potential role in epigenetic regulation, although the specific clinical implications of these findings are not detailed (Hop2020Genomewide).

## Interactions
ZNF544, a zinc finger protein, participates in various interactions that influence its role as a transcription factor. The protein is known to exist in multiple isoforms, which can have distinct transcriptional activities. These isoforms can interact differently with DNA and other proteins, affecting gene regulatory networks. For instance, ZNF544 encodes both activator and repressor isoforms, which can lead to different regulatory outcomes depending on the presence or absence of activation and repression domains (Lambourne2024Widespread).

In the context of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), ZNF544 is part of a cluster of coexpressed KRAB zinc finger protein (KZFP) genes. This cluster is associated with a proliferative and highly metabolic state in a subset of DLBCL samples, termed KZFP High. These samples show upregulation of genes involved in cell-cycle regulation and DNA repair, suggesting that ZNF544 may interact with other proteins to promote these processes. The KZFP High group is also characterized by a depletion of immune cells, indicating potential interactions that contribute to immune evasion (Martins2024A).

ZNF544 is also implicated in the regulation of DNA methylation, co-localizing with binding sites and influencing methylation levels at target CpGs. This suggests interactions with DNA and possibly other proteins involved in epigenetic regulation (Hop2020Genomewide).
