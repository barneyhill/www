# IL1RAPL2

## Overview
The IL1RAPL2 gene encodes the interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein like 2, a member of the interleukin-1 receptor family, which is primarily expressed in the central nervous system. This protein is characterized by its structural components, including extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain, which are typical of the IL1/Toll receptor family (Jin2000Two; Ferrante2001IL1RAPL2). The IL1RAPL2 protein is implicated in cytokine signaling and is thought to play a role in neural development and synaptic plasticity, which are essential for cognitive functions such as learning and memory (Ferrante2001IL1RAPL2). Genetic variations in IL1RAPL2 have been associated with non-specific mental retardation, highlighting its potential clinical significance in neurodevelopmental disorders (Zhang2010An).

## Structure
The IL1RAPL2 protein is composed of 686 amino acids and exhibits structural homology to members of the interleukin-1 receptor family. It contains three conserved extracellular immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domains, a single transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain, which is characteristic of the IL1/Toll receptor family (Jin2000Two; Ferrante2001IL1RAPL2). The protein also features an additional 120-amino acid C-terminal region that does not show significant similarity to other proteins outside the IL1RAPL family (Jin2000Two).

The IL1RAPL2 gene shares a high degree of similarity with the IL1RAPL1 gene, with 70.4% similarity at the protein level, and both genes have a similar exon-intron organization, suggesting a conserved genomic structure (Ferrante2001IL1RAPL2). The C-terminal domain of IL1RAPL2 shows homology to the C-terminal domain of IL1RAPL1 but is not present in other family members (Ferrante2001IL1RAPL2). The IL1RAPL2 protein is specifically expressed in the central nervous system, indicating its potential role in neurological functions (Ferrante2001IL1RAPL2).

## Function
The IL1RAPL2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the interleukin-1 receptor family, which is involved in cytokine signaling and plays a significant role in the immune response and neural development. The IL1RAPL2 protein is specifically expressed in the central nervous system and is believed to influence synapse structure and plasticity, which are critical for learning and memory processes (Ferrante2001IL1RAPL2). The protein shares a high degree of similarity with IL1RAPL1, another member of the interleukin-1 receptor family, and is thought to be involved in modulating neurotransmitter release (Ferrante2001IL1RAPL2).

Structurally, IL1RAPL2 contains conserved cysteine residues that form extracellular Ig-like domains and a cytoplasmic Toll domain, characteristic of the IL1/Toll receptor family (Ferrante2001IL1RAPL2). This structural composition suggests its involvement in signaling pathways that affect neuronal connectivity. Although the specific function of IL1RAPL2 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its expression pattern and homology to IL1RAPL1 imply a role in the development and function of the central nervous system, potentially impacting cognitive processes such as memory and learning (Jin2000Two; Zhang2010An).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IL1RAPL2 gene have been associated with non-specific mental retardation (NSMR) in children, particularly in the QinBa region of China. This condition is characterized by cognitive impairments and an IQ score of 70 or lower. The study by Zhang et al. identified significant differences in allele and genotype distributions of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the IL1RAPL2 gene between NSMR and control groups, with a more pronounced effect observed in girls (Zhang2010An). The IL1RAPL2 gene is closely related to IL1RAPL1, which has been implicated in X-linked mental retardation, suggesting that IL1RAPL2 could also be a mutation locus for NSMR (Jin2000Two; Zhang2010An).

The IL1RAPL2 gene is part of the interleukin-1 receptor family and is involved in the response to IL-1 and IL-18. Polymorphisms in regions near the C-terminal domain of the protein encoded by IL1RAPL2 can affect its interaction with neuronal proteins, potentially leading to NSMR (Zhang2010An). These findings suggest that genetic variants in IL1RAPL2 may confer susceptibility to neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly in populations with a higher prevalence of mental retardation (Zhang2010An).
