# RPA1

## Overview
The RPA1 gene encodes the largest subunit of the heterotrimeric replication protein A (RPA) complex, a crucial player in DNA metabolism, including replication, repair, and recombination. The RPA1 protein, characterized by its oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) folds, is essential for binding single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and stabilizing it during these processes (Fan2012Structure). As a DNA-binding protein, RPA1 is involved in various cellular pathways, including DNA damage response and chromatin assembly, through its interactions with numerous proteins and post-translational modifications (Madru2022DNAbinding; Dueva2020Replication). Clinically, alterations in RPA1 expression and function are linked to genomic instability and cancer predisposition, underscoring its significance in maintaining genomic integrity and its potential as a biomarker in oncology (Outwin2011Increased; Sharma2023Germline).

## Structure
The RPA1 gene encodes a subunit of the heterotrimeric replication protein A (RPA) complex, which is essential for DNA replication and repair. The RPA1 protein features a modular structure with several oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) folds that facilitate its binding to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) (Fan2012Structure). The primary structure of RPA1 includes a DNA-binding domain located in the middle of the RPA70 subunit, which is the largest subunit of the RPA complex (Bochkarev1997Structure).

The secondary structure of RPA1 is characterized by a five-strand OB fold, which includes a β-sheet forming a closed β-barrel and an α-helix connecting the strands (Bochkarev1997Structure). The tertiary structure involves two structurally homologous subdomains oriented in tandem, creating a channel for ssDNA binding (Bochkarev1997Structure). The quaternary structure of the RPA complex is a heterotrimer, consisting of RPA70, RPA32, and RPA14 subunits, with a three-helix bundle mediating their interaction (Fan2012Structure).

RPA1 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which regulate its activity during DNA processing (Bochkarev1997Structure). The protein's structure allows it to perform various functions in DNA replication, recombination, and repair, and to recruit different proteins involved in genome maintenance (Madru2022DNAbinding).

## Function
Replication Protein A1 (RPA1) is a critical component of the heterotrimeric RPA complex, which plays a vital role in DNA metabolism, including replication, repair, and recombination. In healthy human cells, RPA1 stabilizes single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) intermediates, preventing their degradation and secondary structure formation, which is essential for the proper functioning of DNA polymerases during replication (Dueva2020Replication). RPA1 interacts with human primase-polymerase (hPrimPol1), facilitating DNA damage tolerance and replication fork restart, thereby maintaining genomic stability (Dueva2020Replication).

RPA1 is involved in DNA damage response pathways, where it regulates the mono-ubiquitylation of PCNA, a processivity factor for DNA polymerases, and interacts with Rad18, a ubiquitin ligase, to facilitate its recruitment to ssDNA (Dueva2020Replication). It also plays a role in histone deposition during DNA replication, interacting with the Pob3 subunit of the yeast histone chaperone complex FACT, aiding in replication-coupled nucleosome assembly (Dueva2020Replication).

RPA1's post-translational modifications, such as acetylation, ubiquitylation, and SUMOylation, are crucial for its function in the DNA damage response, enhancing interactions with other proteins involved in repair processes (Dueva2020Replication). These functions underscore RPA1's multifaceted role in safeguarding DNA integrity and facilitating chromatin formation during replication.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the RPA1 gene, including mutations and changes in expression levels, have significant clinical implications. Increased RPA1 gene dosage, as seen in 17p13.3 duplication syndrome, is associated with genomic instability and sensitivity to DNA damage. This condition can lead to abnormal cell cycle distribution, particularly in the S phase, and increased chromosomal instability, potentially contributing to clinical features such as developmental delay and autism spectrum disorder (Outwin2011Increased).

In colorectal cancer, RPA1 expression is regulated by PTEN, which recruits OTUB1 to deubiquitinate RPA1, maintaining its stability. Loss of PTEN results in reduced RPA1 levels, which is linked to colorectal carcinoma development. RPA1 haploinsufficiency in mouse models has been shown to promote colorectal cancer, indicating its role in tumor suppression (Wang2015PTEN).

In breast cancer, low RPA1 expression is associated with aggressive tumor features and poor prognosis. It is linked to shorter survival in ER-positive breast cancer patients receiving endocrine therapy, suggesting its potential as a predictive biomarker for treatment response (Algethami2023Unravelling).

Germline variants of RPA1 have been identified as potential cancer predisposition factors in pediatric malignancies, including solid tumors and hematological cancers, highlighting its role in oncogenesis (Sharma2023Germline).

## Interactions
RPA1, a subunit of the replication protein A (RPA) complex, is involved in numerous interactions with proteins and nucleic acids essential for DNA replication, repair, and recombination. RPA1 binds to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) primarily through its DNA-binding domains, stabilizing the ssDNA during these processes (Dueva2020Replication). It interacts with RAD51 recombinase, facilitating the displacement of RPA from ssDNA to allow RAD51 filament formation, which is crucial for homologous recombination (Dueva2020Replication). RPA1 also interacts with RAD52, which assists in the handoff of ssDNA to RAD51 in alternative homologous recombination pathways (FousekSchuller2024The).

RPA1's interaction with ATR-interacting protein (ATRIP) and Ewing's tumor-associated antigen 1 (ETAA1) is vital for ATR activation at stalled replication forks, playing a role in checkpoint signaling (Dueva2020Replication). It also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, although this interaction is inhibited when RPA is bound to ssDNA (Caldwell2020Dynamic). RPA1 is involved in nucleotide excision repair through its interaction with xeroderma pigmentosum group A (XPA), enhancing specificity and stability for damaged DNA (Caldwell2020Dynamic). These interactions highlight RPA1's multifaceted role in maintaining genomic stability.
