# LRRC14

## Overview
The LRRC14 gene encodes the protein leucine-rich repeat-containing 14, which is part of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of LRR motifs, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and are crucial for various cellular processes. The LRRC14 protein is implicated in modulating signaling pathways, although its precise biological functions and mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. It is not classified as a kinase, receptor, or transmembrane protein, but rather as a cytoplasmic protein that may play a role in cellular signaling and structural organization (Qiu2020aarFDC). Further research is needed to understand its potential involvement in disease pathways and its clinical significance.
