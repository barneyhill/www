# DLK1

## Overview
DLK1, or delta like non-canonical Notch ligand 1, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and development. The protein, characterized by its epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats, plays a significant role in modulating cell fate decisions, particularly in stem cell biology and adipogenesis. DLK1 acts as a negative regulator of adipocyte differentiation and is involved in maintaining mesenchymal stem cells in an undifferentiated state. It is also implicated in immune response modulation and interacts with key signaling pathways such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Clinically, alterations in DLK1 expression are associated with several diseases, including Temple syndrome and various cancers, where it can influence tumorigenesis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The protein's ability to interact with and modulate Notch signaling pathways, albeit in a non-canonical manner, underscores its complex role in both normal physiology and disease states (Abdallah2007dlk1FA1; Grassi2020Hypoxiainduced; Pittaway2021The).

## Structure
DLK1 (delta like non-canonical Notch ligand 1) is a transmembrane protein encoded by the DLK1 gene, characterized by its involvement in cell differentiation and development. The primary structure of DLK1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its complex architecture. The secondary structure of DLK1 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and functional conformation. A notable feature of DLK1 is the presence of EGF-like repeats, which are structural motifs commonly found in proteins that participate in cell signaling pathways. These repeats play a crucial role in mediating interactions with other cellular components.

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are known to occur in DLK1, influencing its function and stability. Glycosylation can affect the protein's folding, trafficking, and interactions, thereby modulating its biological activity. DLK1 also exhibits several splice variant isoforms, which may have distinct functional roles in various cellular contexts. These isoforms arise from alternative splicing events, leading to variations in the protein's structure and potentially its function. The diversity of DLK1 isoforms underscores its versatile role in cellular processes and its importance in developmental biology.

## Function
The DLK1 gene, also known as delta-like 1 or fetal antigen-1 (FA1), is a member of the epidermal growth factor-like homeotic protein family and plays a critical role in modulating cell fate decisions throughout development. It is expressed from an imprinted gene paternally expressed at 14q32 and is known to maintain human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) in an undifferentiated state (Abdallah2007dlk1FA1). DLK1 acts as a negative regulator of adipocyte differentiation and inhibits the differentiation of hMSC into osteoblasts and adipocytes (Abdallah2007dlk1FA1). The extracellular domain of DLK1, known as FA1, is biologically active and its serum levels change in certain pathological conditions (Abdallah2007dlk1FA1).

DLK1 influences the immune response by modulating the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and immune response-related factors. It affects signaling pathways such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and insulin-like growth factor-I receptor-mediated p42/p44 MAPK activation (Abdallah2007dlk1FA1). DLK1 expression leads to the up-regulation of chemokines, complement components, and prostaglandin synthases involved in inflammatory responses (Abdallah2007dlk1FA1). It also up-regulates genes associated with apoptosis, such as CASP1, CASP8, and TNFAIP3, which work with cytokines to induce cell death and activate NF-B signaling (Abdallah2007dlk1FA1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DLK1 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. Temple syndrome (TS14) is a rare imprinting disorder linked to genetic and epigenetic changes in the 14q32 imprinted domain, where DLK1 is located. This syndrome can result from maternal uniparental disomy, imprinting defects, or paternal microdeletions, leading to an imbalance in gene expression. Clinical features of Temple syndrome include short stature, muscular hypotonia, and precocious puberty, with DLK1 playing a significant role in its pathogenesis (Baena2024Novel).

In cancer, DLK1 is implicated in various malignancies, including neuroendocrine tumors, hepatoblastoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Its expression is often upregulated in these cancers, correlating with poor prognosis and increased tumorigenic potential. DLK1 is involved in promoting tumorigenesis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, particularly through the Notch signaling pathway (Pittaway2021The). In medullary thyroid carcinoma, DLK1 copy number gain is associated with increased expression and pathogenic phenotypes (Araujo2021Comprehensive).

DLK1's role in cancer is complex, as it can both promote and inhibit Notch signaling, depending on the context. This dual role complicates its potential as a therapeutic target (Pittaway2021The).

## Interactions
DLK1, a transmembrane protein, is involved in various cellular interactions, particularly in the context of glioma and muscle development. In glioma, DLK1 undergoes cleavage by the enzyme ADAM17, releasing an intracellular fragment that translocates to the nucleus, suggesting a potential role in nuclear signaling (Grassi2020Hypoxiainduced). This cleavage process is dependent on hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha, indicating an interaction with these factors under hypoxic conditions (Grassi2020Hypoxiainduced).

DLK1 is structurally similar to the Notch/Delta/Serrate family but acts as a Notch antagonist, inhibiting Notch's ability to transactivate target genes such as Hes1 (Rogers2012Localizing). Despite this structural similarity, DLK1's effects in glioma appear to be independent of Notch signaling (Grassi2020Hypoxiainduced).

In muscle development, DLK1 interacts with satellite cells, influencing their differentiation and proliferation. It is suggested that DLK1 may exert its effects in a non-cell autonomous manner, potentially interacting with neighboring cells to regulate muscle hypertrophy and regeneration (Waddell2010Dlk1). However, specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids in this context are not detailed.
