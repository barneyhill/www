# CYLC1

## Overview
The CYLC1 gene encodes cylicin-1, a cytoskeletal protein predominantly found in the sperm head, specifically within the calyx of mature sperm cells. Cylicin-1 is characterized by its high isoelectric point and unique structural motifs, including lysine-rich tripeptides and proline-rich C-terminal regions, which contribute to its role in maintaining sperm head integrity (Schneider2023Cylicins; Hess1993Molecular). As a major component of the perinuclear theca, cylicin-1 is essential for the proper attachment of the acrosome to the sperm nucleus, a critical process for normal sperm morphology and fertility (Jin2024Disruption). The protein interacts with various other proteins, forming complexes that are vital for the structural organization and function of sperm cells. Disruptions in CYLC1 can lead to significant fertility issues, highlighting its importance in male reproductive health (Jin2024Disruption; Schneider2023Cylicins).

## Structure
The CYLC1 (cylicin 1) protein is a major component of the sperm head cytoskeleton, specifically localized in the calyx of mature sperm. It is characterized by a high proportion of positively charged amino acids, contributing to an isoelectric point greater than pH 10 (Schneider2023Cylicins; Hess1993Molecular). The primary structure of CYLC1 includes numerous lysine-lysine-X (KKX) tripeptides, where X is often aspartic acid, forming the motif KKD, which is repeated multiple times throughout the molecule (Hess1993Molecular). The central part of the protein is organized into repeating units of up to 41 amino acids, predicted to form short alpha helices (Schneider2023Cylicins; Hess1993Molecular).

The C-terminal tail of CYLC1 is rich in proline residues, which likely disrupts helical structures and contributes to the protein's unique folding pattern (Hess1993Molecular). CYLC1 interacts with other proteins in the perinuclear theca, such as SPACA1 and FAM209, forming a complex that anchors the acrosome to the nucleus (Jin2024Disruption). These interactions suggest a role in maintaining the structural integrity of the sperm head, although detailed tertiary and quaternary structures are not explicitly described in the available literature.

## Function
The CYLC1 gene encodes cylicin-1, a protein that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity of sperm cells. Cylicin-1 is a major component of the perinuclear theca (PT), a dense cytoplasmic structure that encapsulates the sperm nucleus. It is specifically expressed in spermatids and is essential for the proper attachment of the acrosome to the sperm nucleus, a critical process for normal sperm morphology and fertility (Jin2024Disruption).

Cylicin-1 interacts with other PT proteins, such as ACTRT1, ACTRT2, ACTL7A, CAPZA3, and CCIN, forming a complex necessary for acrosome attachment. It also interacts with the nuclear envelope protein FAM209 and the inner acrosomal membrane protein SPACA1, which are crucial for anchoring the acrosome to the nucleus (Jin2024Disruption). The protein's dynamic localization during spermiogenesis, from the subacrosomal layer to the postacrosomal region, is vital for maintaining sperm head architecture (Jin2024Disruption).

In healthy human cells, cylicin-1 ensures the structural organization of the sperm cytoskeleton, contributing to the stability and motility of sperm cells. Its proper function is essential for male fertility, as disruptions in cylicin-1 can lead to acrosome detachment, sperm head deformities, and infertility (Jin2024Disruption; Schneider2023Cylicins).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CYLC1 gene have been associated with male infertility due to their impact on sperm morphology and function. A case study highlighted a 40-year-old man with rare missense variants in both CYLC1 and CYLC2 genes, leading to significant fertility issues. The CYLC1 variant c.1720G>C results in an amino acid change from glutamic acid to glutamine, which is predicted to be deleterious and is located in a region intolerant to such substitutions. This variant is extremely rare in the general population and is associated with morphological abnormalities in sperm, including head defects and abnormal flagella, similar to those observed in cylicin-deficient mice (Schneider2023Cylicins).

The absence of CYLC1 protein in the patient's sperm, confirmed through immunofluorescence staining, indicates a functional impact of the missense variant on the CYLC1 protein. This absence disrupts the proper assembly of the sperm calyx, leading to structural defects that contribute to infertility (Schneider2023Cylicins). The study suggests that mutations in CYLC1 can lead to structural anomalies in sperm cells, which are crucial for male fertility (Schneider2023Cylicins). Further research is needed to fully understand the impact of these gene variants on human fertility.

## Interactions
CYLC1, also known as cylicin-1, is a protein that plays a crucial role in sperm development by interacting with various proteins within the perinuclear theca (PT) and other cellular structures. CYLC1 is known to self-interact, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation assays using FLAG-tagged and Myc-tagged CYLC1 in HEK293T cells (Jin2024Disruption). It also interacts with several PT proteins, including ACTRT1, ACTRT2, ACTL7A, CAPZA3, and CCIN, forming a PT-SAL plate that is essential for connecting the acrosome to the nuclear envelope (Jin2024Disruption). The interaction between CYLC1 and ACTL7A has been confirmed through endogenous co-IP assays and microscale thermophoresis (MST) analysis, which showed a dose-dependent binding affinity (Jin2024Disruption).

CYLC1 also interacts with the nuclear envelope protein FAM209 and the inner acrosomal membrane protein SPACA1. These interactions were confirmed by co-IP assays and MST analysis, indicating CYLC1's role in maintaining the acrosome-nucleus connection (Jin2024Disruption). The disruption of CYLC1 affects the interaction between SPACA1 and ACTL7A, highlighting its importance in the structural integrity of sperm cells (Jin2024Disruption). These interactions are critical for proper sperm morphology and function, and their disruption can lead to male infertility (Jin2024Disruption).
