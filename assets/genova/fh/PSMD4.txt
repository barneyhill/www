# PSMD4

## Overview
PSMD4 is a gene that encodes the proteasome 26S subunit ubiquitin receptor, non-ATPase 4, a crucial component of the 26S proteasome complex. This protein functions as a ubiquitin receptor, playing a pivotal role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system by recognizing and binding polyubiquitinated proteins, thereby facilitating their degradation. As a non-ATPase subunit, PSMD4 is integral to the proteasome's regulatory particle, contributing to the maintenance of protein homeostasis within the cell. The protein's interactions with various signaling pathways and tumor suppressor proteins, such as p53, underscore its involvement in cellular processes related to cancer progression and tumorigenesis. PSMD4's expression and genetic alterations have been linked to several cancer types, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology (Zhang2023PSMD4; Larsson2022Pancancer; Ma2019PSMD4).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
PSMD4 has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels and genetic alterations. In esophageal cancer, PSMD4 is significantly upregulated, enhancing cell viability and reducing apoptosis, indicating its oncogenic role. Its overexpression suppresses endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), which is linked to cancer progression (Ma2019PSMD4). In breast cancer, PSMD4 is frequently overexpressed, particularly in subtypes like Luminal B, HER2/ER-, and Basal-like, and is associated with poor prognosis and adverse clinical outcomes (Xuan2021Prognostic; Larsson2022Pancancer). 

PSMD4 is also involved in ovarian cancer, where its upregulation correlates with poor overall survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Li2023PSMD8). In adrenocortical carcinoma and acute myeloid leukemia, high PSMD4 expression is linked to poor survival, highlighting its role as a risky factor in these cancers (Li2021Integrated). 

The gene's amplification and overexpression are common across various cancer types, contributing to tumor progression and poor clinical outcomes. These findings suggest that PSMD4 could serve as a therapeutic target and biomarker for cancer prognosis and treatment (Li2021Integrated; Larsson2022Pancancer).

## Interactions
PSMD4, a subunit of the 26S proteasome, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function as a ubiquitin receptor. It plays a significant role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system by recognizing and binding polyubiquitinated proteins, facilitating their degradation. In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PSMD4 interacts with the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β signaling pathway, leading to the phosphorylation of downstream molecules such as Akt, GSK-3β, mTOR, and 4E-BP1. This interaction is linked to the modulation of COX2 expression, which is associated with cancer progression (Zhang2023PSMD4).

PSMD4 also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53. It has been shown to inhibit p53 transcription by binding to specific sites, with the C-terminal domain of PSMD4 being crucial for this interaction. This interaction contributes to the degradation of p53, promoting tumorigenesis in HCC (Zhang2023PSMD4).

In colorectal cancer, PSMD4 is upregulated by cytoplasmic Nrf2 (cNrf2), which promotes its expression. This upregulation leads to the degradation of p53, facilitating the nuclear export of Nrf2 via CRM1 and promoting cell invasion through the β-catenin/ZEB1 axis (Lin2016Cytoplasmic).
