# FAM131C

## Overview
FAM131C is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 131, member C. This protein is implicated in various cellular signaling pathways, although its specific functions are not fully characterized. The FAM131C protein is expressed in multiple tissues, suggesting a broad functional role in cellular processes such as growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. It is thought to contribute to the regulation of cellular responses to external stimuli, potentially influencing cell cycle progression and programmed cell death. Despite its widespread expression and potential importance in maintaining cellular functions, the detailed molecular activities and specific cellular locations of FAM131C remain to be elucidated (Naderi2020Genomic; Greither2022GenomeWide).

## Function
FAM131C is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes. While the specific functions of FAM131C are not fully characterized, it is part of the FAM131 family, which is generally implicated in cellular signaling pathways. These proteins may play roles in cell growth, differentiation, or apoptosis. FAM131C is expressed in multiple tissues, suggesting it has a broad functional role in the body. The protein's involvement in signaling pathways indicates it may contribute to the regulation of cellular responses to external stimuli, potentially influencing processes such as cell cycle progression and programmed cell death. The widespread expression of FAM131C across different tissues highlights its potential importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and organismal homeostasis. However, detailed molecular activities and specific cellular locations of FAM131C remain to be elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
The FAM131C gene has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to mutations and alterations in its expression. In the context of male fertility, a genome-wide association study identified a missense mutation in the FAM131C gene, specifically the SNP rs77667563, which shows a significant difference in allele frequency between infertile and fertile men. This mutation is associated with conditions such as cryptorchidism and teratozoospermia, which are linked to male infertility (Greither2022GenomeWide). Additionally, the testicular transcript abundance of the murine orthologue to FAM131C was found to be decreased in male mice with impaired spermatogenesis, suggesting a role in spermiogenesis (Greither2022GenomeWide).

In cancer research, the expression and DNA methylation levels of FAM131C have been associated with overall survival in malignancies. Specifically, the DNA methylation level of FAM131C in primary tumors has shown a strong prognostic value, indicating its potential role as a biomarker for cancer prognosis (Naderi2020Genomic). Furthermore, FAM131C is involved in porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection, where it suppresses the host's immune response, facilitating viral replication. The microRNA ssc-miR-1343 targets FAM131C to inhibit PEDV replication, highlighting its role in viral infections (Qin2024Exosomal).
