# FBL

## Overview
The FBL gene encodes fibrillarin, a highly conserved nucleolar protein that functions primarily as a methyltransferase. Fibrillarin is integral to the processing and modification of pre-ribosomal RNA (rRNA), playing a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis. It is a core component of the small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) complex, which is essential for the 2'-O-methylation of rRNA, a modification critical for ribosomal stability and function. The protein's structure includes a glycine and arginine-rich (GAR) domain, a central methyltransferase domain, and a C-terminal α-helical domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. Fibrillarin's activity extends beyond rRNA processing, influencing nucleolar architecture and cellular integrity. Dysregulation of FBL expression is implicated in various clinical conditions, including cancer and developmental disorders, underscoring its importance in cellular homeostasis and disease (Rodriguez‐Corona2015Fibrillarin; Newton2003Fibrillarin; Bouffard2018Fibrillarin).

## Structure
Fibrillarin (FBL) is a highly conserved nucleolar protein with a complex molecular structure. The human fibrillarin molecule consists of three major structural domains: an N-terminal glycine and arginine-rich (GAR) domain, a central methyltransferase domain, and a C-terminal α-helical domain. The GAR domain is involved in nuclear localization and nucleolar retention, and it undergoes methylation on several arginine residues, which may facilitate specific protein interactions (Rodriguez‐Corona2015Fibrillarin). The central domain, which is a methyltransferase domain, is highly conserved and features a seven-stranded β-sheet flanked by three α-helices on each side, typical of AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases (Shubina2016Nucleolar). This domain also contains an RNA-binding motif, crucial for its function in rRNA processing (Rodriguez‐Corona2015Fibrillarin).

The tertiary structure of fibrillarin includes a Rossmann fold, which is common among methyltransferases, and the protein often forms homodimers, suggesting a functional molecular interface (Wang2000Crystal). In terms of quaternary structure, fibrillarin is a key component of small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins (snoRNPs), forming complexes with proteins such as Nop56, Nop58, and 15.5K in eukaryotes (Shubina2016Nucleolar). These complexes are essential for the methylation and processing of pre-rRNA.

## Function
Fibrillarin (FBL) is a crucial protein in the nucleolus of human cells, primarily involved in the processing and modification of pre-ribosomal RNA (rRNA). It functions as a methyltransferase, catalyzing the 2'-O-methylation of rRNA, which is essential for ribosome biogenesis and the structural stability of ribosomes (Rodriguez‐Corona2015Fibrillarin; Newton2003Fibrillarin). FBL is a key component of the small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) complex, which is vital for rRNA methylation and ribosome assembly (Rodriguez‐Corona2015Fibrillarin).

FBL is involved in the co-transcriptional sorting of nascent pre-rRNA, particularly the 5' ETS-1 region of 47S pre-rRNA, which is crucial for ribosome biogenesis (Yao2019Nascent). The protein's self-association, mediated by its glycine-arginine-rich (GAR) domain, is essential for the phase separation process that drives the assembly of dense fibrillar components (DFC) in the nucleolus (Yao2019Nascent). This process is critical for the proper sorting and processing of pre-rRNA (Yao2019Nascent).

Fibrillarin's activity is not limited to rRNA processing; it also plays a role in histone H2A glutamine methylation, which is specific to the nucleolus and suggests a role in nucleolar architecture (Rodriguez‐Corona2015Fibrillarin). The protein's function is essential for cellular and nucleolar integrity, as its depletion leads to significant developmental failures and apoptosis (Newton2003Fibrillarin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FBL gene, which encodes the nucleolar protein fibrillarin, have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. In breast cancer, both overexpression and underexpression of FBL are associated with poor prognosis. Overexpression of FBL is linked to increased cellular proliferation and resistance to chemotherapy, contributing to poor survival outcomes in breast cancer patients (Nguyen2022Low; Shubina2018Proliferation). Conversely, low levels of FBL expression are also associated with poor prognosis, characterized by reduced ribosomal protein levels and distinct molecular profiles in tumors, suggesting a complex role in cancer progression (Nguyen2022Low).

In addition to cancer, FBL mutations can lead to developmental defects. In zebrafish, mutations in the FBL gene result in impaired ribosome biogenesis and neuronal differentiation, particularly affecting the dorsal midbrain and retina. These mutations cause defects in S-phase progression and increased apoptosis, highlighting the essential role of FBL in early development and cell cycle regulation (Bouffard2018Fibrillarin). These findings suggest that FBL dysregulation may contribute to ribosomopathies, a group of disorders characterized by ribosome dysfunction (Bouffard2018Fibrillarin).

## Interactions
Fibrillarin (FBL) is a nucleolar protein that plays a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis through its interactions with various proteins and nucleic acids. It is a core component of the box C/D small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) complex, which includes proteins such as Nop56, Nop58, and a 15.5 kDa protein in eukaryotes, and Nop5 and L7Ae in archaea. This complex is involved in the site-specific 2′-O-methylation of RNA nucleotides, a critical step in rRNA processing (Shubina2016Nucleolar).

FBL interacts with small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) like U3, U8, and U13, participating in early pre-rRNA processing stages, including endonuclease cleavage (Shubina2016Nucleolar). It also interacts with the splicing factor 2-associated protein p32 and Nop52, which are involved in ribosome maturation. These interactions are essential for the separation of 90S preribosomal particles into 40S and 60S particles (Yoshikawa2011Splicing).

FBL's interactions extend to viral proteins, such as the HIV-1 Tat protein, which impairs pre-rRNA processing by preventing FBL from binding to the 5' end of nascent 47S pre-rRNA (DecleCarrasco2023Current). It also interacts with the non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of the Influenza A virus, affecting ribosomal biogenesis and host cell processes (DecleCarrasco2023Current).
