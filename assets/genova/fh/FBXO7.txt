# FBXO7

## Overview
FBXO7 is a gene that encodes the F-box protein 7, a member of the F-box protein family, which plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). This system is crucial for protein homeostasis, as it targets proteins for degradation, thereby preventing the accumulation of damaged or misfolded proteins. The F-box protein 7 is a component of the SCF (Skp, Cullin, F-box containing) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, where it functions as a substrate recognition subunit. The protein is characterized by several domains, including an N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain, a central FP domain, a proline-rich region, and an F-box domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its role in cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and mitochondrial quality control (Randle2017Structure; Zhou2016Linking). Mutations in the FBXO7 gene are linked to parkinsonian-pyramidal syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in neurodegenerative diseases (Fonzo2009FBXO7; DelgadoCamprubi2016Deficiency).

## Structure
The FBXO7 gene encodes the F-box protein 7, which is part of the Fbxo sub-family of F-box proteins. The protein structure includes several distinct domains: an N-terminal ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain, a central FP (Fbxo7/PI31) domain, a C-terminal proline-rich region (PRR), and an F-box domain (FBD) (Randle2017Structure). The Ubl domain, spanning amino acids 1-78, shares homology with ubiquitin and is involved in binding to the 26S proteasome, playing a role in protein degradation and mitochondrial quality control (Randle2017Structure). The FP domain, located between amino acids 180-324, features an α/β-fold with a central five-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet, facilitating dimerization and interaction with PI31 (Randle2017Structure).

The PRR, from amino acids 423-522, is characterized by a high proline content and includes a PxxP motif, which may aid in protein-protein interactions (Randle2017Structure). The F-box domain, located approximately two-thirds along the sequence, enables interaction with Skp1, forming part of the SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (Randle2017Structure). FBXO7 has multiple isoforms, with isoform 1 being the most abundant and containing all these domains, while isoform 2 lacks the Ubl domain (Nelson2013Beyond; Randle2017Structure).

## Function
FBXO7, or F-box protein 7, is a crucial component of the Skp-Cullin-F-box (SCF) ubiquitin E3 ligase complex, which plays a significant role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). This system is responsible for targeting and degrading unneeded or damaged proteins through proteolysis, thereby maintaining protein homeostasis and preventing the accumulation of misfolded proteins that can lead to proteotoxicity (Zhou2016Linking). FBXO7 specifically recognizes substrates and mediates their ubiquitination, which is essential for maintaining cellular function and preventing neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's disease (Zhou2016Linking).

FBXO7 is involved in several cellular processes, including the formation of protein complexes, maintenance of genome stability, synapse formation, and circadian rhythms. It is primarily expressed in the cerebral cortex, globus pallidum, and substantia nigra, with lesser expression in the hippocampus and cerebellum (Zhou2016Linking). The protein also plays a role in neuroprotective mitophagy, a process that clears damaged mitochondria, thus protecting neurons from degeneration (Zhou2016Linking). In healthy cells, FBXO7 contributes to mitochondrial integrity and protein quality control, which are vital for normal cellular function (Zhou2016Linking).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FBXO7 gene are associated with a rare autosomal recessive condition known as parkinsonian-pyramidal syndrome, also referred to as PARK15. This syndrome is characterized by early-onset parkinsonism combined with pyramidal tract signs, such as spasticity and the Babinski sign. Patients may also experience symptoms like bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and postural instability (Fonzo2009FBXO7; Joseph2017Mechanistic). The disease progression is typically slow, and the response to levodopa treatment varies among individuals (Fonzo2009FBXO7).

FBXO7 mutations have been identified in various populations, including Italian, Dutch, Iranian, and Chinese families, with different mutations leading to a range of phenotypic expressions. These include juvenile-onset parkinsonism with pyramidal signs and atypical symptoms such as mental retardation, eyelid apraxia, and chorea (Lohmann2015A; Wei2018Juvenileonset; Paisán‐Ruiz2010Early‐onset). The FBXO7 protein is part of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex, and its dysfunction due to mutations can lead to impaired mitochondrial metabolism and neurodegeneration, contributing to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease and related disorders (Conedera2016FBXO7; DelgadoCamprubi2016Deficiency).

## Interactions
FBXO7, a member of the F-box protein family, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It forms part of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex by interacting with SKP1, CUL1, and RBX1, where it serves as the substrate-recruiting subunit (Joseph2017Mechanistic). The F-box domain of FBXO7 mediates its interaction with SKP1, facilitating the ubiquitination of target proteins (Randle2017Structure).

FBXO7 also interacts with the cyclin D/CDK6 complex through a CDK6 binding domain, playing a role in cell cycle regulation by enhancing CDK6 activity and stabilizing the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 (Randle2017Structure; Joseph2017Mechanistic). It binds to the proteasomal regulator PI31 via the FP (FBXO7/PI31) domain, influencing proteasome activity (Joseph2017Mechanistic).

In the context of mitochondrial quality control, FBXO7 interacts with PINK1 and Parkin, which are essential for mitophagy. This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of Parkin to mitochondria, facilitating the autophagic clearance of damaged mitochondria (Randle2017Structure; Joseph2017Mechanistic). FBXO7 also binds to the proteasome subunit PSMA2, affecting proteasome assembly and function (Joseph2017Mechanistic). These interactions underscore FBXO7's multifaceted role in protein ubiquitination, cell cycle regulation, and mitochondrial maintenance.
