# OR1S1

## Overview
The OR1S1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 1 subfamily S member 1, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions primarily as an olfactory receptor, playing a pivotal role in the detection and transduction of odorant signals in the olfactory epithelium (Hayeck2021Improved; Goswami2010Quadruple). Beyond its role in olfaction, OR1S1 is implicated in various cellular processes, including skin homeostasis, where it may influence epidermal balance and sensitivity (Uehara2021Non‐invasive). Although its clinical significance is not fully understood, OR1S1 has been associated with certain cancers, such as breast cancer and lung adenocarcinoma, suggesting potential roles in tumor biology that warrant further investigation (FONSECASANCHÉZ2013microRNA18b; Wang2022The).

## Function
The OR1S1 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules. These receptors are primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where they bind specific odorants, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell (Hayeck2021Improved; Goswami2010Quadruple). The OR1S1 protein, like other olfactory receptors, is involved in various cellular processes beyond olfaction, including epidermal and keratinocyte proliferation, migration, regeneration, and cytokine production (Uehara2021Non‐invasive). 

In the context of skin biology, OR1S1 and other olfactory receptors are expressed in the skin and may influence skin homeostasis. The downregulation of OR1S1 has been associated with sensitive skin, suggesting a potential role in maintaining epidermal balance and contributing to skin sensitivity (Uehara2021Non‐invasive). However, the specific function of OR1S1 in healthy human cells remains unclear, as studies have not directly addressed its role outside of these contexts (Wong2013Tacrolimus).

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the OR1S1 gene, which encodes an olfactory receptor, is not well-documented in terms of specific diseases or conditions resulting from its mutations or altered expression. However, some studies have explored its potential involvement in cancer. In breast cancer, particularly in miR-18b-deficient MDA-MB-231 cells, the OR1S1 gene is upregulated with a fold change of 4.49, suggesting an indirect regulatory mechanism possibly involving transcription factors like PDX1 (FONSECASANCHÉZ2013microRNA18b). The role of OR1S1 in breast cancer remains unclear, and further research is needed to understand its clinical significance (FONSECASANCHÉZ2013microRNA18b).

In lung adenocarcinoma patients with a history of breast cancer, OR1S1 is listed among the top ten high-frequency mutation genes, with a mutation frequency of 35%. However, the clinical implications of these mutations are not specifically detailed in the study (Wang2022The). While OR1S1 is mentioned in the context of colorectal cancer as part of the TCF7-correlated transcriptome, its clinical significance in this setting is not elaborated (Mayer2020Diverse). Overall, the clinical relevance of OR1S1 mutations or expression changes requires further investigation.
