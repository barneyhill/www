# EEF1E1

## Overview
EEF1E1 is a gene that encodes the protein eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 epsilon 1, which plays a pivotal role in the elongation phase of protein synthesis. This protein is a component of the macromolecular tRNA synthase complex and is involved in the delivery of aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome, a critical step for accurate and efficient protein translation (Han2021A; Anisimova2023Human). EEF1E1 is categorized as a translation elongation factor and is localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it also participates in DNA damage response pathways, including ATM/ATR-mediated p53 activation (Han2021A). The gene's expression is regulated post-transcriptionally, reflecting its importance in the complex regulation of protein synthesis machinery (Anisimova2023Human). EEF1E1 is also implicated in various cancers, where its expression levels correlate with disease prognosis and immune response modulation (Han2021A).

## Function
EEF1E1, also known as eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 epsilon 1, is a protein-coding gene involved in the elongation phase of protein synthesis. In healthy human cells, EEF1E1 functions as an auxiliary component of the macromolecular tRNA synthase complex in the cytoplasm, where it plays a crucial role in facilitating the delivery of aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome. This process is essential for accurate and efficient protein translation, impacting cellular growth and function (Han2021A; Anisimova2023Human).

The EEF1E1 protein is localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells. In the cytoplasm, it is involved in protein synthesis, while in the nucleus, it has been shown to translocate during DNA damage, where it participates in ATM/ATR-mediated p53 activation. This indicates a role in the DNA damage response and cell cycle regulation (Han2021A).

The expression of EEF1E1 is regulated at the translational level rather than the transcriptional level, suggesting its abundance is controlled post-transcriptionally. This regulation highlights its role in the complex and tissue-specific nature of the translation machinery in humans (Anisimova2023Human).

## Clinical Significance
The EEF1E1 gene, also known as eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 epsilon 1, has been implicated in various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer. In HCC, EEF1E1 expression is significantly higher in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and high expression levels are associated with worse overall survival, disease-specific survival, and progression-free survival. This suggests that EEF1E1 could serve as an independent prognostic marker for HCC (Han2021A).

EEF1E1 expression is correlated with several clinicopathological features in HCC, such as body weight, BMI, tumor status, vascular invasion, AFP levels, and cancer stages. It is also linked to immune infiltration in tumors, showing significant correlations with various immune cells, including cytotoxic cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and different types of T cells. High EEF1E1 expression is associated with lower enrichment scores for cytotoxic cells, dendritic cells, and neutrophils, but higher scores for macrophages and NK CD56bright cells (Han2021A).

In the context of T cell differentiation, EEF1E1 is involved in promoting Th1 differentiation when TCR affinity is high, indicating its role in immune response regulation (Kotov2019TCR).

## Interactions
EEF1E1, also known as eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 epsilon 1, participates in several protein interactions crucial for its role in translation elongation. It forms a heterodimer with MARS1, as demonstrated by X-ray crystallography (PDB ID 2UZ8), and this interaction is characterized by a strong binding affinity (Oakley2023Hidden; Kong2020Cell‐based). EEF1E1 also engages in a non-canonical interaction with EPRS1, which was accurately predicted by AlphaFold with a high confidence score (MC score of 0.93) (Oakley2023Hidden).

In addition to these interactions, EEF1E1 is capable of forming a homodimer, as evidenced by structural data (Oakley2023Hidden). Within the broader context of the eEF1 complex, EEF1E1 is involved in the assembly of the multisynthetase complex (MSC), interacting with various aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. This interaction is facilitated by its cGST domains, which are essential for both canonical and non-canonical dimerization interactions (Oakley2023Hidden).

EEF1E1 also interacts with ATM and ATR proteins in the cytoplasm, with these interactions being modulated by DNA damage and UV irradiation, respectively (Han2021A). These interactions suggest a role for EEF1E1 in DNA damage response pathways, particularly in the context of ATM/ATR-mediated p53 activation (Han2021A).
