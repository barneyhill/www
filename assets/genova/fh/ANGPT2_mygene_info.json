The protein encoded by this gene is an antagonist of angiopoietin 1, and both angiopoietin 1 and angiopoietin 2 are ligands for the endothelial TEK receptor tyrosine kinase. Angiopoietin 2 is upregulated in multiple inflammatory diseases and is implicated in the direct control of inflammation-related signaling pathways. The encoded protein affects angiogenesis during embryogenesis and tumorigenesis, disrupts the vascular remodeling ability of angiopoietin 1, and may induce endothelial cell apoptosis. This gene serves a prognostic biomarker for acute respiratory distress syndrome.
