# GPR153

## Overview
GPR153 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 153, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is characterized by its role in transmembrane signaling. This receptor is involved in various physiological processes, including the regulation of keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, as well as potential roles in neurological functions. GPR153 is expressed in both the skin and brain, where it may influence cell growth and cognitive behaviors, respectively (Ehrlich2018Expression; Pilar2023A). The receptor is also implicated in several clinical conditions, such as schizophrenia and anxiety-related behaviors, and is a target of the Gli1 transcription factor within the Hedgehog signaling pathway, which is significant for cerebellum development (Fernandez2019ChildhoodOnset; Lee2010Hedgehog). Despite its involvement in these pathways, the precise mechanisms and broader implications of GPR153 in human health and disease continue to be areas of active research.

## Function
GPR153 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in regulating keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation. In human keratinocytes, GPR153 has been shown to play a role in cell growth regulation, potentially through Gαi coupled receptor pathways. Knockdown of GPR153 significantly decreases keratinocyte proliferation, indicating its involvement in maintaining normal cell proliferation rates (Pilar2023A). Despite its role in keratinocyte proliferation, GPR153 does not appear to be essential for skin homeostasis under normal conditions, as knockout mice for homologous genes do not show apparent defects in skin development. However, its overexpression in 3D organotypic cultures can lead to abnormal skin development and differentiation, suggesting potential pathological effects when dysregulated (Pilar2023A).

GPR153 is also expressed in the brain, where it may be involved in neurological processes. It is identified as a target of the Gli1 transcription factor in the Hedgehog signaling pathway, which is crucial for cerebellum development and potentially in tumorigenesis (Lee2010Hedgehog). The specific function of GPR153 in healthy human brain cells remains less clear, but its expression pattern suggests a role in cognitive functions and behavior (Ehrlich2018Expression).

## Clinical Significance
GPR153 has been implicated in various neurological and psychiatric disorders. Alterations in its expression or mutations may contribute to conditions such as schizophrenia and anxiety-related behaviors. A specific de novo mutation, arg73cys, in the GPR153 gene has been identified in a male patient with childhood-onset schizophrenia, suggesting a potential link between this gene and the disorder (Fernandez2019ChildhoodOnset). In animal studies, knockdown of GPR153 in mice resulted in reduced food intake and increased anxiety, indicating its role in anxiety-related behaviors (Fernandez2019ChildhoodOnset).

In the context of cancer, GPR153 is expressed in certain cancer cell lines, including triple-negative breast cancer, where it may contribute to the malignant phenotype (Insel2018GPCRomics:). However, its specific role in cancer progression or as a therapeutic target remains to be fully elucidated.

In medulloblastoma, particularly the Sonic Hedgehog subtype (SHH-MB), GPR153 is upregulated in mouse models but not in human tumors, highlighting species-specific differences in its expression (Łastowska2019Differential). This suggests that while GPR153 may serve as a biomarker or therapeutic target in mouse models, its clinical significance in human SHH-MB is limited.
