# SETDB1

## Overview
SETDB1, or SET domain bifurcated histone lysine methyltransferase 1, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which functions as a histone methyltransferase. This enzyme is primarily involved in the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9), a modification that is crucial for chromatin compaction and transcriptional repression. The SETDB1 protein is characterized by a complex domain structure, including Tudor domains, a methyl-CpG-binding domain, and a bifurcated SET domain, which are essential for its role in epigenetic regulation (Basavapathruni2016Characterization; Markouli2021Structure). SETDB1 plays a significant role in maintaining heterochromatin structure, regulating gene expression, and ensuring genomic stability by suppressing retroelements (Matsui2010Proviral; Markouli2021Structure). It is involved in various cellular processes, including nervous system development and X chromosome inactivation, and interacts with multiple proteins to exert its functions (Strepkos2021Histone; Markouli2021Structure). The gene's dysregulation is implicated in several cancers and neuropsychiatric disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Strepkos2021Histone; Zhu2020Epigenetic).

## Structure
The SETDB1 protein is composed of 1291 amino acids and is characterized by a complex domain structure that includes an N-terminal region with three Tudor domains, a methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD), and a C-terminal region with pre-SET, SET, and post-SET domains (Markouli2021Structure). The Tudor domains are crucial for forming complexes with proteins that regulate transcriptional activity through chromatin modifications (Guo2021Structure‐Guided). The MBD domain is involved in DNA binding and gene silencing by interacting with DNA Methyltransferase 3 (Markouli2021Structure).

The SET domain is essential for the protein's methyltransferase activity, specifically targeting lysine 9 on histone H3 (H3K9) (Basavapathruni2016Characterization). This domain is bifurcated, containing an intercepting sequence of approximately 150 amino acids, which is a characteristic feature of lysine methyltransferases (Markouli2021Structure). The protein's enzymatic activity is enhanced by ubiquitination at the K867 residue (Markouli2021Structure).

SETDB1 exists in three isoforms. Isoform 1 is the complete protein with full enzymatic activity, isoform 2 is shorter due to alternative splicing, and isoform 3 lacks enzymatic activity due to the absence of C-terminal domains (Markouli2021Structure). The protein also contains nuclear export and localization signals that regulate its cellular localization (Markouli2021Structure).

## Function
SETDB1, also known as SET domain bifurcated histone lysine methyltransferase 1, is a crucial enzyme in epigenetic regulation, primarily involved in the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9). This methylation leads to chromatin compaction and transcriptional repression, playing a significant role in maintaining heterochromatin structure and regulating gene expression (Matsui2010Proviral; Markouli2021Structure). SETDB1 is active in the nucleus and is essential for various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, cell proliferation, and the suppression of retroelements, which helps maintain genomic stability (Matsui2010Proviral; Markouli2021Structure).

In healthy human cells, SETDB1 is involved in nervous system development by maintaining the expression of pluripotency-associated transcription factors and inhibiting astrocyte-related genes during early embryogenesis (Strepkos2021Histone; Markouli2021Structure). It also plays a role in the inactivation of the X chromosome and the formation of promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies, which are involved in apoptosis and DNA damage response (Markouli2021Structure). SETDB1's activity is regulated through interactions with various proteins and complexes, such as KRAB-ZFP-KAP-1, which guide it to specific genomic regions for effective gene silencing (Markouli2021Structure).

## Clinical Significance
The SETDB1 gene is implicated in various cancers and neuropsychiatric disorders due to its role in chromatin modification and gene silencing. In cancer, SETDB1 is frequently overexpressed, leading to the downregulation of tumor suppressor genes and promoting tumorigenesis. It is notably overexpressed in liver, breast, bladder, ovarian, and uterine cancers, where it contributes to tumor growth and metastasis (Strepkos2021Histone). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), SETDB1 overexpression is linked to increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, although its significance may decrease in later stages (Strepkos2021Histone). In melanoma, high SETDB1 expression is associated with increased tumor thickness and invasiveness, serving as a prognostic factor (Strepkos2021Histone).

In neuropsychiatric disorders, SETDB1 is involved in conditions such as schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and autism spectrum disorder. Increased SETDB1 expression and associated histone modifications have been observed in schizophrenia, suggesting a role in its pathophysiology (Zhu2020Epigenetic). In autism spectrum disorder, SETDB1 haploinsufficiency is supported by evidence of its involvement in synaptic development and function, with mutations affecting cognitive function (Xu2016Chromosomal). These findings highlight SETDB1's clinical significance as a potential therapeutic target in both cancer and neuropsychiatric disorders.

## Interactions
SETDB1, a histone methyltransferase, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in gene silencing and chromatin modification. It forms a multimeric complex with other histone H3 lysine 9 methyltransferases (HKMTs) such as Suv39h1, G9a, and GLP. These interactions are part of a larger megacomplex that plays a role in gene silencing, particularly at the Oct3/4 promoter during retinoic acid-induced differentiation (Fritsch2010A). SETDB1 interacts directly with Suv39h1, G9a, and GLP, forming a heterotetramer that is essential for the stability and function of these proteins (Fritsch2010A).

SETDB1 also interacts with the corepressor TRIM28 (KAP1), which recruits it to specific genomic locations enriched for H3K9me3, a mark associated with gene silencing. This recruitment is facilitated by zinc finger transcription factors containing a Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, such as ZNF274 (Frietze2010ZNF274). Additionally, SETDB1 forms a complex with ATF7IP and MBD1, which is important for transcriptional repression and heterochromatin formation. The interaction with ATF7IP enhances SETDB1's stability and nuclear retention, while MBD1 is necessary for its recruitment to replicating DNA during the S-phase (Basavapathruni2016Characterization).
