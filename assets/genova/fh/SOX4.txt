# SOX4

## Overview
SOX4 is a gene that encodes the SRY-box transcription factor 4, a member of the SRY-related high-mobility group (HMG) box family of transcription factors. This protein is characterized by its HMG box domain, which facilitates DNA binding and bending, playing a pivotal role in regulating gene expression. As a transcription factor, SOX4 is involved in numerous developmental and cellular processes, including the regulation of pathways such as Wnt, TGFβ, and PI3K, which are crucial for the development of various organs and tissues (Hanieh2020SOX4:; Moreno2020SOX4:). The protein's interactions with other transcription factors and its involvement in chromatin remodeling underscore its importance in cellular differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. Dysregulation of SOX4 has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including intellectual developmental disorders and various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Hanieh2020SOX4:; Grippa2024Landscape).

## Structure
The SOX4 protein is characterized by its high-mobility group (HMG) box domain, which is crucial for DNA binding and bending. This domain is located near the N-terminus and is responsible for the protein's ability to interact with DNA, particularly within the minor groove, and induce structural changes such as bends and kinks (van1993Sox4; Singh2021Molecular). The HMG box domain shows nearly 100% identity within the SOXC subgroup, which includes SOX11 and SOX12, and about 50% identity with the rest of the SOX family (Grosse2023Novel).

The C-terminal region of SOX4 contains a transactivation domain (TAD), which is rich in serine residues and is essential for its function as a transcriptional activator. This domain is involved in interactions with various cofactors and is crucial for the protein's transactivation capabilities (van1993Sox4; Grosse2023Novel). The TAD is characterized by a typical composition of acidic, serine, and proline residues, and contains conserved phosphorylation sites that may modulate the protein's activity (Dy2008The).

SOX4 may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and apparent molecular weight (Dy2008The). The protein's structure allows it to interact with other transcription factors, such as POU3F2, and regulate various developmental processes (Grosse2023Novel).

## Function
SOX4 is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in various molecular processes and cell biology functions in healthy human cells. It is a member of the SRY-related High Mobility Group (HMG) box family and is characterized by its ability to bind to the minor groove of DNA, leading to changes in chromatin architecture and transcriptional activities of downstream genes (Hanieh2020SOX4:). SOX4 is involved in several developmental pathways, including Wnt, TGFβ, and PI3K signaling, which are essential for normal development across various organs and tissues such as the central nervous system, heart, and pancreas (Moreno2020SOX4:).

In healthy cells, SOX4 is expressed in a spatial and temporal pattern, playing critical roles in processes like B lymphocyte differentiation, where it induces gene rearrangements of the immunoglobulin heavy chain by activating the Rag1 and Rag2 genes (Hanieh2020SOX4:). It also suppresses Wnt signaling by inducing casein kinase 1ε expression, ensuring proper organ development and function (Hanieh2020SOX4:). SOX4's activity is primarily nuclear, where it influences the transcription of target genes, impacting cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration (Scharer2009GenomeWide). Its role in these processes is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SOX4 gene are associated with a range of clinical conditions. Pathogenic variants in SOX4 have been linked to intellectual developmental disorders, characterized by speech delay and dysmorphic facial features. These variants often result in a loss of transcriptional activity, contributing to the disorder's clinical phenotype (Grippa2024Landscape). Specific missense mutations, such as p.Arg61Gln and p.His119Tyr, disrupt SOX4's function by affecting critical residues in the HMG domain, leading to intellectual disabilities and developmental delays (Grosse2023Novel).

In cancer, SOX4 is frequently overexpressed and is implicated in tumorigenesis. High levels of SOX4 expression are associated with poor prognosis and increased risk of recurrence in various cancers, including colorectal, breast, and prostate cancers (Hanieh2020SOX4:). In colorectal cancer, elevated SOX4 levels correlate with shorter recurrence-free survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Andersen2009Dysregulation). SOX4's role in cancer progression is linked to its involvement in pathways such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which promotes cancer cell migration and invasion (Hanieh2020SOX4:). These findings highlight the gene's significance in both developmental disorders and cancer.

## Interactions
SOX4, a transcription factor, engages in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, influencing multiple cellular pathways. It interacts with the transcription factor Tbx3, a T-box protein, through its high mobility group (HMG) domain. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of the gap junction protein Cx43 during heart development. SOX4 also interacts with other T-box proteins, such as Tbx2 and Tbx5, indicating a level of binding promiscuity (Boogerd2011Sox4).

In the context of prostate cancer cells, SOX4 interacts with plakoglobin, a component of the Wnt signaling pathway. This interaction modulates Wnt signaling by inhibiting β-catenin-mediated transcriptional activity, suggesting a competitive binding mechanism between plakoglobin and β-catenin for SOX4 (Lai2011SOX4).

SOX4 also plays a role in the DNA damage response by interacting with the tumor suppressor protein p53. It stabilizes p53 by blocking Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination and enhancing p53 acetylation through interactions with acetyltransferases p300 and CBP. This interaction is critical for p53's transcriptional activity and its role in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Pan2009Induction).
