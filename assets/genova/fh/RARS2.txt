# RARS2

## Overview
The RARS2 gene encodes the mitochondrial arginyl-tRNA synthetase 2 (mtArgRS), a crucial enzyme involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis. This enzyme belongs to the class of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which are responsible for attaching specific amino acids to their corresponding tRNAs, a fundamental step in the translation of mitochondrial-encoded proteins (Lühl2016Novel; Li2015A). The proper function of mtArgRS is essential for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and energy production, particularly in cells with high energy demands, such as neurons (Nevanlinna2020A). Variants in the RARS2 gene can lead to significant clinical manifestations, including pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 6 (PCH6), a severe neurodegenerative disorder characterized by early-onset epilepsy and cerebellar atrophy (van2018What’s). The study of RARS2 and its encoded protein provides insights into mitochondrial biology and its implications in human health and disease.

## Structure


## Function
The RARS2 gene encodes the mitochondrial arginyl-tRNA synthetase (mtArgRS), an enzyme crucial for protein synthesis within mitochondria. This enzyme catalyzes the attachment of arginine to its corresponding tRNA, a key step in the translation of mitochondrial-encoded proteins (Lühl2016Novel; Li2015A). The proper functioning of mtArgRS is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production, particularly in high-energy demanding cells like neurons (Nevanlinna2020A). 

In healthy human cells, RARS2 is responsible for the synthesis of a 578 amino-acid/65 kDa protein, which plays a critical role in mitochondrial protein translation (Nicolle2023A). The gene's expression is regulated by a Kozak sequence, which is essential for the proper initiation of translation. Variants in this sequence can significantly reduce RARS2 protein levels, impacting mitochondrial function (Nicolle2023A). 

The activity of mtArgRS is vital for cellular metabolism and overall organismal health, as it ensures the correct translation of mRNA into proteins within mitochondria, supporting normal cellular function and development (Sevinç2022A). The enzyme's role in protein synthesis is crucial for the maintenance of mitochondrial integrity and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RARS2 gene are associated with pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 6 (PCH6), a severe neurodegenerative disorder. PCH6 is characterized by early-onset epilepsy, progressive global atrophy including the pons and cerebellum, lactic acidosis, and mitochondrial respiratory chain defects (van2018What’s). Patients with RARS2 mutations often exhibit severe developmental delay, refractory epilepsy, and elevated lactic acid levels in plasma or cerebrospinal fluid (van2018What’s). Brain MRI typically shows cerebellar hypoplasia or atrophy, which can progress rapidly (van2018What’s).

A specific non-coding variant in the Kozak sequence of the RARS2 gene, NM_020320.3:c.-2A > G, significantly decreases protein levels and is linked to PCH6. This variant leads to a reduction in RARS2 mRNA and protein levels, contributing to clinical manifestations such as developmental delay, seizures, and cerebellar atrophy (Nicolle2023A). The study of this variant highlights the challenges in predicting the pathogenicity of non-coding variants, particularly those affecting translation initiation (Nicolle2023A).

Additionally, a novel RARS2 variant has been associated with liver involvement, presenting as cholestasis and lactic acidosis, which is a new clinical feature not previously linked to RARS2 mutations (Sevinç2022A).

## Interactions
RARS2, the mitochondrial arginyl-tRNA synthetase, is involved in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of arginine to its corresponding tRNA. This enzyme is crucial for mitochondrial function and interacts with other mitochondrial proteins involved in translation. The RARS2 protein is part of the mitochondrial translation machinery, and its interactions are essential for maintaining mitochondrial protein synthesis and cellular energy metabolism (Wang2020Multi-Omics).

Mutations in RARS2 can affect its function and interactions within the mitochondria. For instance, the RARS2 R6C mutation impacts the mitochondrial targeting sequence, potentially disrupting mitochondrial transport and affecting protein interactions (Wang2020Multi-Omics). This mutation is associated with mitochondrial encephalopathy and has been observed in cancer, indicating its role in altering RNA-protein interactions (Porter2021easyCLIP).

RARS2 is also implicated in various disorders, such as pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 6 (PCH6), where mutations lead to reduced aminoacylation of tRNA-Arg, affecting high-energy demanding cells like neurons (Nevanlinna2020A). These interactions and mutations highlight the critical role of RARS2 in mitochondrial function and its potential impact on cellular processes.
