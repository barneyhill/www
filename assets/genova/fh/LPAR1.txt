# LPAR1

## Overview
Lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 (LPAR1) is a gene that encodes a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) known as lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1. This receptor is part of the class A GPCR family, characterized by a seven-transmembrane alpha-helical structure, and is involved in a wide range of physiological processes. LPAR1 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, heart, and lungs, and plays a crucial role in cellular activities such as proliferation, migration, and survival. The receptor mediates its effects through several signaling pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Rho pathways, influencing processes like neurogenesis, angiogenesis, and vascular maturation (Geraldo2021Role; Choi2010LPA). LPAR1's interactions with other proteins and its involvement in disease pathogenesis, particularly in cancer and neurological disorders, highlight its significance as a potential therapeutic target (Konopa2022LPA; Liu2022Reduction).

## Structure
The lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 (LPAR1) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a seven-transmembrane alpha-helical bundle, typical of class A GPCRs (Chrencik2015Crystal). The N-terminus of LPAR1 forms a six-turn alpha helix, stabilized by a disulfide bond linking it to extracellular loop 2 (ECL2), contributing to the stability of the ligand-binding pocket (Chrencik2015Crystal). 

The receptor's ligand-binding pocket is spherical, allowing it to recognize a diverse range of ligands (Chrencik2015Crystal). Key residues involved in ligand binding include Asp129 and Trp210, which are significant for ligand specificity (Chrencik2015Crystal). Upon agonist binding, structural changes occur, such as the outward displacement of transmembrane segment 6 (TM6) and inward shift of TM7, facilitating G-protein coupling and activation (H2022Structure). 

The receptor's activation involves a 'twin toggle switch' mechanism, with rearrangements in motifs like PIF, NPxxY, and DRY being crucial for its function (H2022Structure). LPAR1's structure also includes a polar recognition region on the extracellular side and a hydrophobic pocket within the transmembrane region, which accommodates the acyl chain of ligands (H2022Structure). 

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation can affect LPAR1's activity, and alternative splicing may result in different isoforms, influencing its role in signaling pathways.

## Function
LPAR1, or lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1, is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a significant role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is widely expressed in several organs, including the brain, uterus, testis, lung, small intestine, heart, stomach, kidney, spleen, thymus, placenta, and skeletal muscle (Geraldo2021Role). LPAR1 is involved in cell proliferation, survival, migration, and cytoskeletal changes, primarily through the activation of multiple signaling pathways such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phospholipase C (PLC), Akt, and Rho pathways (Choi2010LPA).

In the nervous system, LPAR1 is crucial for neurogenesis, neuronal migration, and neuron-glia interactions. It is expressed in neural progenitors, neurons, astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and Schwann cells, influencing processes like cortical development and cell survival (Geraldo2021Role; Choi2010LPA). LPAR1 also plays a role in maintaining blood-brain barrier integrity and CNS angiogenesis (Geraldo2021Role).

In the vascular system, LPAR1 is involved in angiogenesis, vascular maturation, and endothelial cell responses, contributing to processes like wound healing and vascular smooth muscle cell behavior (Choi2010LPA). Its signaling pathways are essential for maintaining normal cellular functions and homeostasis (Lin2021Lysophosphatidic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the LPAR1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In neuroblastoma, an activating mutation known as R163W in the LPAR1 gene has been identified, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of metastatic neuroblastoma by altering signaling pathways (Wei2013Massively). Reduced expression of LPAR1 in neuroblastoma cells is associated with increased tumor cell migration, suggesting that LPAR1 normally inhibits migration and its downregulation promotes metastasis (Liu2022Reduction).

In breast cancer, LPAR1 expression is highest in ER+HER2- tumors and lowest in triple-negative breast cancer, with high expression correlating with improved survival outcomes. This suggests a protective role against cancer aggressiveness (Benesch2023Lysophosphatidic). In other cancers, such as ovarian and pancreatic, LPAR1 is involved in enhancing metastasis and tumor motility through various signaling pathways (Lin2021Lysophosphatidic).

LPAR1 is also implicated in central nervous system disorders. In Parkinson's disease, decreased LPAR1 expression is linked to the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, suggesting its role in neuron survival (Geraldo2021Role). Additionally, LPAR1 is involved in neuroinflammation and cell motility in neuroblastoma cells, contributing to tumor invasion and metastasis (Xiao2021The).

## Interactions
LPAR1, or lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1, is involved in several significant protein interactions that influence various cellular processes. It interacts with Filamin A (FLNA) and myocardin-related transcription factor A (MRTF-A) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), promoting FLNA phosphorylation at serine 2152. This phosphorylation is crucial for the formation of the FLNA-MRTF-A complex, which enhances MRTF transcriptional activity and the expression of MRTF/SRF target genes (Konopa2022LPA).

In pancreatic cancer, LPAR1 interacts with N-WASP and SNX18, forming a complex that is essential for the receptor's recycling and preventing its degradation. This interaction is crucial for maintaining effective signaling pathways that promote cell motility and growth (Juin2019NWASP).

LPAR1 also interacts with the SARS-COV2 Envelope Protein (E), suggesting a role in the viral infection mechanism. This interaction was confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation and cell surface staining, indicating that LPAR1 may serve as a cell surface receptor for the E protein (NALLUR2020SARSCOV2).

These interactions highlight LPAR1's role in various signaling pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target in different diseases.
