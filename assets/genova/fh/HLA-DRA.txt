# HLA-DRA

## Overview
The HLA-DRA gene encodes the alpha chain of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, DR alpha protein, which is integral to the immune system's function. This protein is a transmembrane component that plays a pivotal role in antigen presentation, a process essential for the activation of CD4+ T helper cells. The HLA-DRA gene is nearly monomorphic, with limited polymorphism, and is primarily expressed in antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. The protein's structure includes a signal peptide and two external domains, which are crucial for its role in forming a heterodimer with the beta chain, typically encoded by HLA-DRB1, to present extracellular peptides to the immune system (Das1983Structure; Matern2019Insights). The expression and function of HLA-DRA are tightly regulated by various transcription factors and promoter elements, ensuring its critical role in maintaining immune surveillance and response (Matsushima1992Activation; Osborne1997Retinoblastoma).

## Structure
The HLA-DRA gene encodes the alpha chain of the HLA-DR protein, a component of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II. The primary structure of the HLA-DRA protein consists of a polypeptide chain with specific amino acid sequences. The mature protein is composed of 229 amino acids, with the first 25 amino acids forming a hydrophobic signal peptide (Das1983Structure). The secondary structure includes two external domains, with the first domain comprising amino acids 3-84 and the second domain comprising amino acids 85-178. The second domain contains two cysteine residues that form a disulfide loop, a feature common in immunoglobulin-like domains (Das1983Structure).

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains into a stable three-dimensional conformation, which is crucial for its function in antigen presentation. The quaternary structure of the HLA-DR protein involves the assembly of the alpha chain with a beta chain, typically encoded by HLA-DRB1, to form a functional heterodimer (Matern2019Insights).

Post-translational modifications include glycosylation at specific sites, such as Asn78-Tyr79-Thr80 and Asn118-Val119-Thr120, which are important for protein stability and function (Das1983Structure). The protein also contains a potential phosphorylation site at serine residue 220 (Das1983Structure). The HLA-DRA gene is nearly monomorphic, with limited polymorphism primarily in the cytoplasmic tail, resulting in two known isoforms, HLA-DRA*01:01 and HLA-DRA*01:02 (Matern2019Insights).

## Function
The HLA-DRA gene encodes the alpha chain of the HLA-DR protein, a component of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. These molecules are essential for the immune system's ability to present extracellular peptides to CD4+ T helper cells, a critical step in initiating immune responses (Osborne1997Retinoblastoma; Matern2019Insights). The HLA-DRA protein is primarily active in antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells, where it facilitates the recognition of foreign antigens by T cells (Abdulkadir1995Functional).

The HLA-DRA gene is involved in the presentation of processed antigens to CD4+ T cells, which is crucial for the adaptive immune response. This process allows the immune system to distinguish between 'self' and 'nonself' peptides, triggering an appropriate immunogenic response (Matern2019Insights). The expression of HLA-DRA is regulated by various transcription factors and promoter elements, including the X, Y, and TATA boxes, which are necessary for its transcriptional activity (Matsushima1992Activation; Osborne1997Retinoblastoma). The proper function and expression of HLA-DRA are vital for maintaining immune surveillance and preventing infections (Winkler2017Human).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the HLA-DRA gene have been associated with various diseases and conditions. In low-grade glioma (LGG), high expression levels of HLA-DRA are linked to poor prognosis, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic biomarker. The gene's expression correlates with immune infiltration, particularly affecting macrophage M1 phenotype and negatively impacting NK cell activation (Chen2022New).

In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), reduced expression of HLA-DR antigens, which include HLA-DRA, is associated with hypermethylation of the DRa gene regions. This hypermethylation leads to transcriptionally inactive genes, contributing to immunoregulatory dysfunctions in SLE (Sano1985Low).

HLA-DRA has also been implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD). A specific single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs3129882, in the HLA-DRA gene is associated with increased expression of MHC class II molecules, potentially contributing to PD risk through enhanced immune responsiveness and chronic inflammation (Kannarkat2015Common).

Additionally, HLA-DRA variants have been identified as predictors of penicillin allergy, influencing the presentation of beta-lactam-derived antigenic motifs and affecting allergy mechanisms (Guéant2015HLADRA). These findings highlight the gene's significant role in various immune-related conditions.

## Interactions
The HLA-DRA gene encodes a protein that is part of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, which plays a crucial role in the immune response by presenting peptides to CD4+ T cells. The expression of the HLA-DRA gene is regulated by various protein-DNA interactions at its promoter region. The promoter contains critical cis-acting elements, including the X and Y boxes, and the octamer site, which are essential for its transcriptional regulation.

The transcription factor TRAX1 specifically binds to the X1 sequence of the HLA-DRA promoter, acting as a transcriptional activator. This interaction is distinct from other known X1-binding proteins such as RFX1, NF-X, and NF-Xc, indicating a unique role for TRAX1 in regulating HLA-DRA expression (ItohLindstrom1995Affinity).

The high mobility group protein HMG I/Y enhances the binding of the transcription factor Oct-2A to the octamer element of the HLA-DRA promoter, facilitating its transactivation. This interaction is specific to Oct-2A and does not enhance the binding of other proteins like Oct-1 (Abdulkadir1995Functional). Additionally, interferon gamma (IFN-γ) up-regulates interactions at the X1 and X2 boxes, enhancing class II expression in certain cell lines (Wright1992In).
