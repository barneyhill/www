# SH3GLB1

## Overview
SH3GLB1 is a gene that encodes the protein SH3 domain containing GRB2 like, endophilin B1, which is a crucial player in cellular processes such as autophagy, endocytosis, and membrane dynamics. This protein is categorized as a membrane-associated protein and is involved in the regulation of intracellular trafficking and membrane remodeling. SH3GLB1 is particularly significant in the autophagic turnover of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in skeletal muscle, as well as in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and apoptosis. The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as TRIM63 and beclin1, underscore its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and influencing disease progression, including cancer and viral infections (Chien2022SH3GLB1related; Khan2013Role).

## Function
SH3GLB1, also known as endophilin B1, is a protein involved in several critical cellular processes, including autophagy, endocytosis, and membrane dynamics. In healthy human cells, SH3GLB1 plays a significant role in the autophagic turnover of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRN) in skeletal muscle. It is involved in the initial formation of endocytic CHRN vesicles and escorts these receptors through multiple steps of autophagic turnover, particularly under conditions of muscle atrophy (Khan2013Role). SH3GLB1 interacts with TRIM63 and is present in endocytic CHRN vesicles, where it colocalizes with MAP1LC3A, indicating its involvement in the lipidation process essential for autophagy (Khan2013Role).

SH3GLB1 is also suggested to regulate ATG9 trafficking and mediate the fission of autophagic donor membranes, triggering starvation-induced autophagy (Khan2013Role). It is associated with autophagic cargo rather than donor membranes, highlighting its role in selective autophagy processes. The protein is active in the cytoplasm and associated with cellular membranes, influencing cell survival and homeostasis by interacting with other proteins and lipids. This involvement in membrane remodeling and intracellular trafficking underscores its importance in maintaining cellular function and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SH3GLB1 gene, also known as endophilin B1, have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and viral infections. In glioblastoma (GBM), SH3GLB1 is associated with resistance to the chemotherapy drug temozolomide (TMZ). High expression levels of SH3GLB1 correlate with worse survival outcomes in GBM patients, as it plays a role in mitochondrial metabolism and autophagy, processes that contribute to TMZ resistance (Chien2022SH3GLB1related). SH3GLB1 is also linked to tumor-initiating features in GBM, with its expression enhancing oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and contributing to the survival of tumor-initiating cells (Chien2022SH3GLB1related; Chien2023Role).

In the context of viral infections, SH3GLB1 expression is upregulated in porcine alveolar macrophages infected with the classical swine fever virus, suggesting its involvement in the viral infection process (Hu2019Classical). Additionally, SH3GLB1 has been identified as an autophagy-related gene with potential diagnostic value in Kawasaki disease, indicating its role in immune cell interactions (Zhu2023Identification). These findings highlight the clinical significance of SH3GLB1 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
SH3GLB1, also known as endophilin B1, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes such as autophagy, apoptosis, and mitochondrial dynamics. It directly interacts with TRIM63, a protein involved in the autophagic turnover of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRN) in skeletal muscle. This interaction is crucial for the formation and processing of endocytic CHRN vesicles, highlighting SH3GLB1's role in receptor turnover (Khan2013Role).

In the context of glioblastoma, SH3GLB1 is associated with autophagy and mitochondrial metabolism, contributing to chemotherapy resistance. It interacts with beclin1 and PI3KC3, essential components for autophagosome formation, and regulates oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes, affecting mitochondrial respiration and polarization (Chien2022SH3GLB1related).

SH3GLB1 also interacts with proteins involved in membrane dynamics, such as dynamin-related proteins, impacting mitochondrial morphology and function. Despite its involvement in various interactions, SH3GLB1 does not bind to proline-rich peptides derived from SOS1, indicating specificity in its interaction patterns (Kazemein2024Functional). These interactions underscore SH3GLB1's multifaceted role in cellular homeostasis and disease progression.
