# FAM91A1

## Overview
FAM91A1 is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 91 member A1, which plays a crucial role in intracellular vesicle trafficking. This protein is a component of the WDR11 complex, which is essential for the endosome-to-trans-Golgi network (TGN) pathway, facilitating the tethering of vesicles derived from the AP-1 complex (Navarro2018The). The FAM91A1 protein interacts with TBC1D23, a vesicle-golgin adaptor, indicating its involvement in vesicle capture and trafficking processes (Shin2017TBC1D23). It is implicated in maintaining cellular organization and homeostasis, particularly within the Golgi apparatus, where it is recruited by TBC1D23 (Shin2017TBC1D23). FAM91A1 is also associated with various protein interactions, including those within the dysbindin-containing complex in the brain, suggesting a potential role in synaptic functions and the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Han2014DysbindinAssociated). Additionally, FAM91A1 has clinical significance in conditions such as osteosarcoma and breast cancer, where its expression and gene fusions are linked to disease progression and prognosis (Howarth2021NRG1; Lin2022The).

## Function
The FAM91A1 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in vesicle trafficking within cells. It is part of the WDR11 complex, which is involved in the endosome-to-trans-Golgi network (TGN) pathway. This complex facilitates the tethering of AP-1-derived vesicles, crucial for proper protein localization and trafficking (Navarro2018The). FAM91A1 interacts with TBC1D23, a vesicle-golgin adaptor necessary for endosome-to-Golgi traffic, indicating its involvement in vesicle capture and trafficking processes (Shin2017TBC1D23). Although the specific function of FAM91A1 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, it is suggested to maintain the proper localization and function of certain membrane proteins, potentially affecting the surface exposure of recycling membrane proteins (Shin2017TBC1D23).

FAM91A1 is also implicated in cellular organization and function, contributing to the regulation of molecular interactions and maintaining cellular homeostasis. It is active in specific cellular compartments, such as the Golgi apparatus, where it is recruited by TBC1D23 (Shin2017TBC1D23). The protein's role in vesicle trafficking and its interactions with other proteins highlight its importance in maintaining cellular processes and organization.

## Clinical Significance
FAM91A1 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through its altered expression and interactions. In osteosarcoma, a common malignant bone tumor in adolescents, high expression of FAM91A1 is associated with poor prognosis. This suggests that FAM91A1 may play a role in the progression of this cancer, potentially serving as a prognostic marker (Lin2022The).

In breast cancer, FAM91A1 is involved in gene fusions, such as the FAM91A1-NRG1 fusion. This fusion is in-frame and was identified in a study of breast cancer cases, highlighting the complexity of genomic rearrangements in cancer. The presence of such fusions may contribute to the oncogenic processes in breast cancer (Howarth2021NRG1).

FAM91A1 is also part of the WDR11 complex, which is crucial for protein trafficking. Disruptions in this complex can lead to mislocalization of proteins, potentially affecting cellular functions and contributing to disease states (Navarro2018The).

Additionally, FAM91A1 has been identified as a dysbindin-associated protein in the brain, suggesting a potential link to neurological conditions such as schizophrenia, although specific diseases directly associated with FAM91A1 mutations remain under investigation (Han2014DysbindinAssociated).

## Interactions
FAM91A1 is involved in several protein interactions, forming part of the WDR11 complex, which is crucial for vesicle tethering in the trans-Golgi network (TGN). This complex includes WDR11 and C17orf75, with FAM91A1 playing a significant role in maintaining the stability and proper localization of the complex. Disruption of FAM91A1 affects the stability of both WDR11 and C17orf75, indicating strong interactions within this complex (Navarro2018The).

FAM91A1 is also associated with dysbindin in the P2 synaptosome fraction of the mouse brain. It is part of a dysbindin-containing complex, potentially interacting with other proteins such as WDR11, snapin, muted, pallidin, and proteasome subunits PSMD9 and PSMA4. These interactions were verified by co-immunoprecipitation, suggesting FAM91A1's involvement in the ubiquitin-proteasome system and synaptic functions (Han2014DysbindinAssociated).

Additionally, FAM91A1 is a target of miRNAs such as hsa-miR-9-5p and hsa-miR-9-3p, which are involved in neuron development and differentiation pathways. This highlights its potential role in neurogenesis and related signaling pathways (Gendosz2024The).
