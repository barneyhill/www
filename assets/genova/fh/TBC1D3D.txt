# TBC1D3D

## Overview
TBC1D3D is a gene that encodes the protein TBC1 domain family member 3D, which belongs to the TBC1 domain family known for its role as GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) for Rab GTPases. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of intracellular vesicle trafficking, particularly influencing the activity of RAB5, a key player in endocytosis and membrane transport (Siddiqui2018Chromosome; Neueder2022Abnormal). TBC1D3D is expressed in various human tissues, including muscle, adipose, and fibroblast tissues, where it contributes to essential cellular processes such as endocytosis and exocytosis (Neueder2022Abnormal). The gene is located on chromosome 17 at 17q12, but its study is complicated by high sequence similarity with other family members, which poses challenges for detection and functional analysis (Siddiqui2018Chromosome). Despite these challenges, TBC1D3D's involvement in critical cellular functions highlights its potential significance in maintaining normal cellular operations and its implications in diseases such as kidney renal clear cell carcinoma and Huntington's disease (Neueder2022Abnormal; Wang2021TBC1D3).

## Function
The TBC1D3D gene encodes a protein that is part of the TBC1 domain family, which functions as GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) for Rab GTPases, playing a crucial role in regulating intracellular vesicle trafficking. This protein is involved in modulating the activity of RAB5, an early endosome marker that is essential for endocytosis and membrane transport, influencing receptor sorting and vesicle fusion (Siddiqui2018Chromosome; Neueder2022Abnormal). 

In healthy human cells, TBC1D3D is expressed in various tissues, including muscle, adipose, and fibroblast tissues, where it likely contributes to cellular processes such as endocytosis and exocytosis, impacting cell growth and proliferation (Neueder2022Abnormal). The protein's activity is regulated by the microtubule network, suggesting a role in cellular dynamics and trafficking (Wang2021TBC1D3). 

The TBC1D3D protein is located on chromosome 17, specifically at 17q12, but is challenging to study due to its high sequence similarity with other family members, which complicates its detection and functional analysis (Siddiqui2018Chromosome). Despite these challenges, its involvement in critical cellular processes underscores its potential importance in maintaining normal cellular function.

## Clinical Significance
The TBC1D3D gene has been implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression levels. In kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), TBC1D3D is part of the TBC1D3 family, which is associated with poor prognosis. High expression levels of TBC1D3D correlate with increased cell proliferation and decreased inflammation in KIRC cells, suggesting its role in tumor progression. The gene's expression is linked to immune infiltration, particularly involving CD4+ T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells, and is associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (Wang2021TBC1D3).

In Huntington's disease (HD), TBC1D3D shows significant downregulation in the pre-HD group and restoration towards control levels in the early-HD group across muscle, adipose, and fibroblast tissues. This pattern suggests that TBC1D3D may play a role in the molecular changes observed in HD, potentially acting as a GTPase activating protein to stimulate RAB5 function, which is crucial for endocytosis and membrane transport (Neueder2022Abnormal).

The TBC1D3D gene is also part of the TBC1D family, which faces challenges in detection due to sequence similarities among family members, complicating mass spectrometry analyses (Siddiqui2018Chromosome).
