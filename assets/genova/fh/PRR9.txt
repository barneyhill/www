# PRR9

## Overview
PRR9 is a gene that encodes the proline-rich protein 9, which is involved in various cellular processes. This protein is characterized by its abundance of proline residues, which contribute to its structural properties and potential interactions with other proteins. Although the specific functions of proline-rich protein 9 are not fully elucidated, it is implicated in regulatory pathways that influence cellular growth and differentiation. The gene and its encoded protein have been subjects of interest in studies exploring their roles in health and disease, particularly in the context of their interactions with other molecular pathways (Qiu2020aarFDC).
