# FAM83B

## Overview
FAM83B is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 83, specifically member B. This protein is characterized by its involvement in several critical cellular signaling pathways, including the MAPK/ERK, PI3K-AKT-mTOR, and Wnt/β-catenin pathways, which are essential for cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. The FAM83B protein contains a DUF1669 domain, which facilitates interactions with casein kinase 1 isoforms, influencing processes such as membrane trafficking and DNA replication (Cirello2022FAM83B). It is predominantly expressed in tissues such as the esophagus, bladder, cervix, vagina, and skin, with lower expression levels in the brain (Snijders2017FAM83). FAM83B's interactions with key proteins like the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and CRAF underscore its role in modulating cellular signaling and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer (Qi2021Comprehensive; Cipriano2013Hyperactivation).

## Function
FAM83B is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several key cellular signaling pathways, notably the MAPK/ERK pathway, which is essential for cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. The protein is characterized by the presence of a DUF1669 domain, which interacts with casein kinase 1 isoforms, playing a role in cellular processes such as membrane trafficking and DNA replication (Cirello2022FAM83B). In healthy human cells, FAM83B is expressed at high levels in tissues like the esophagus, bladder, cervix, vagina, and skin, but at low levels in the brain (Snijders2017FAM83).

FAM83B is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cell growth and development. It activates several signaling pathways, including MAPK, PI3K-AKT-mTOR, and Wnt/β-catenin, which are crucial for promoting cell proliferation and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Cirello2022FAM83B). The protein's role in these pathways suggests its involvement in regulating the cell cycle and other fundamental cellular functions. While its specific functions in healthy cells are not fully detailed, its interactions and pathway activations indicate a significant role in maintaining normal cellular processes and organismal outcomes (Cirello2022FAM83B).

## Clinical Significance
FAM83B is implicated in various cancers, notably lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). In LUAD, high FAM83B expression is associated with poor prognosis, shorter survival times, and increased metastatic potential. It contributes to chemotherapy resistance by enhancing mitochondrial metabolism and inhibiting apoptosis, making it an adverse prognostic marker (Wang2024FAM83B). FAM83B overexpression in LUAD cells leads to increased mitochondrial activity, drug resistance, and cancer cell proliferation and migration (Wang2024FAM83B). The gene's role in oncogenic signaling pathways, such as the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways, suggests its involvement in promoting oncogenic transformation and resistance to EGFR-TKI (Yamaura2017Family).

In SCC, FAM83B is highly expressed compared to adenocarcinoma and normal tissues, serving as a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker. Its expression is linked to longer disease-free survival in SCC patients (OKABE2015FAM83B). The gene's involvement in the PI3K/AKT/NF-κB signaling pathway contributes to tumor invasion and metastasis, although the exact mechanisms remain unclear (Zhang2023FAM83B). These findings highlight FAM83B as a significant factor in cancer progression and a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
FAM83B is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. It physically interacts with the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), enhancing its activity through increased phosphorylation at specific tyrosine sites, such as Y1068. This phosphorylation is crucial for recruiting downstream signaling proteins like Grb2, which can activate RAL proteins and stimulate phospholipase D1 (PLD1) activity (Cipriano2013Hyperactivation). FAM83B can co-precipitate with EGFR, indicating a direct physical interaction, although phosphorylated EGFR was not detected in complex with FAM83B, and EGF stimulation disrupted the FAM83B-EGFR complex (Cipriano2013Hyperactivation).

FAM83B also interacts with CRAF, a component of the RAS signaling pathway. It reverses the inhibitory effect of the 14-3-3 protein on CRAF, promoting its localization to the cell membrane and activating the MAPK signaling pathway (Qi2021Comprehensive). This interaction is significant for promoting tumor growth and transformation processes. FAM83B's role in these interactions highlights its potential as a therapeutic target in various cancers, including breast and lung adenocarcinoma (Zhang2023FAM83B).
