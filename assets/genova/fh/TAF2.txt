# TAF2

## Overview
TAF2 is a gene that encodes the TATA-box binding protein associated factor 2, a critical component of the transcription factor IID (TFIID) complex, which is essential for the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II in eukaryotic cells. The TAF2 protein is characterized by an aminopeptidase-like fold and plays a pivotal role in the assembly and stabilization of the TFIID complex, facilitating the transcription of genes, particularly those involved in ribosome assembly and protein synthesis (Trowitzsch2015Cytoplasmic; Cheng2024TAF2). TAF2 interacts with other TAFs, such as TAF8 and TAF10, forming a subcomplex that is crucial for the nuclear import and function of the holo-TFIID complex (Trowitzsch2015Cytoplasmic). Mutations in the TAF2 gene have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, including Mental Retardation, Autosomal Recessive 40 (MRT40) syndrome, highlighting its significance in normal cognitive and developmental processes (LesieurSebellin2021Phenotype; Hellman-Aharony2013Microcephaly).

## Structure
TAF2 is a component of the TFIID complex, essential for transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II. The protein is predicted to have an aminopeptidase-like fold, with a structured domain and an additional unstructured C-terminal region (Trowitzsch2015Cytoplasmic). The aminopeptidase domain of TAF2 includes four subdomains (D1-D4), with the D3 domain containing arginine and lysine-rich loops that interact with DNA, indicating its role in DNA binding within the TFIID complex (Kolesnikova2018Molecular).

TAF2 is part of the central lobe of the holo-TFIID complex and interacts with other TAFs, such as TAF8 and TAF10, forming a subcomplex crucial for the assembly of the nuclear holo-TFIID complex (Trowitzsch2015Cytoplasmic). The interaction between TAF2 and TAF8 is mediated by multiple peptide motifs in the TAF8 C-terminal region, which are essential for the formation of the TAF2-8-10 complex (Trowitzsch2015Cytoplasmic).

TAF2 lacks a nuclear localization sequence and relies on TAF8 for nuclear import, highlighting its dependency on other TAFs for proper localization and function (Patel2020Recent). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function (Trowitzsch2015Cytoplasmic).

## Function
TAF2 is a component of the TFIID complex, which is essential for the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II in eukaryotic cells. It plays a critical role in the assembly of the nuclear holo-TFIID complex by forming a heterotrimeric subcomplex with TAF8 and TAF10 in the cytoplasm. This subcomplex is transported into the nucleus, where it integrates into the core-TFIID complex, facilitating transcription initiation from promoters with initiator (Inr) elements (Trowitzsch2015Cytoplasmic).

TAF2 is involved in regulating a subset of genes, particularly those encoding ribosomal proteins, which are crucial for ribosome assembly and global protein synthesis. This regulation is vital for cell growth and proliferation, as TAF2 depletion can lead to impaired ribosome assembly, reduced protein translation efficiency, and growth defects (Cheng2024TAF2).

In the nucleus, TAF2 is part of the TFIID complex that binds to specific DNA sequences, stabilizing the complex and facilitating the assembly of the transcription machinery. It is predicted to adopt an aminopeptidase-like fold, with an additional C-terminal unstructured region, which may contribute to its function in transcription regulation (Trowitzsch2015Cytoplasmic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TAF2 gene are associated with a rare neurodevelopmental disorder known as Mental Retardation, Autosomal Recessive 40 (MRT40) syndrome. This condition is characterized by severe intellectual disability, postnatal microcephaly, pyramidal signs, and a thin corpus callosum. Individuals with biallelic mutations in TAF2 often present with severe intellectual disability, global developmental delay, postnatal microcephaly, feet deformities, and delayed myelination of the brain (LesieurSebellin2021Phenotype; Hellman-Aharony2013Microcephaly). Specific mutations, such as c.2380T > A (p.Tyr794Asn) and c.557 C > G (p.Thr186Arg), have been identified in affected individuals, indicating an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern (LesieurSebellin2021Phenotype; Hellman-Aharony2013Microcephaly).

TAF2 mutations have also been linked to microcephaly, thin corpus callosum, and intellectual disability syndrome. These mutations are not found in control populations, suggesting their pathogenicity (Hellman-Aharony2013Microcephaly). The TAF2 gene's role in transcriptional regulation is crucial, and its dysfunction can lead to significant developmental and neurological impairments. The gene's involvement in ribosome assembly and protein synthesis further underscores its importance in cellular growth and function (Cheng2024TAF2).

## Interactions
TAF2 is a component of the TFIID complex, where it interacts with other TAFs and the TATA-binding protein (TBP) to facilitate transcription initiation. Within the TFIID complex, TAF2 is involved in specific regulatory functions, particularly in the expression of genes related to ribosome assembly. It binds to a small subset of Pol II-regulated promoters, including those encoding ribosomal proteins such as RPL30 and RPL39, which are crucial for ribosome assembly and protein synthesis (Cheng2024TAF2).

TAF2 is part of a subcomplex with TAF8 and TAF10, which assembles in the cytoplasm and is essential for the formation of the nuclear holo-TFIID complex. TAF8 interacts with TAF10 through histone fold domains and with TAF2 via multiple motifs, facilitating the incorporation of TAF2 into the nuclear core-TFIID complex (Trowitzsch2015Cytoplasmic).

In yeast, TAF2 interacts with Taf14, a subunit of the TFIID complex, to mediate DNA binding. This interaction is crucial for TFIID's role in gene transcription, as it facilitates the deposition of the TATA-binding protein and impacts the transcriptional regulation of certain genes (Klein2022Taf2).
