# CSNK1G3

## Overview
The CSNK1G3 gene encodes the protein casein kinase 1 gamma 3, which is a member of the casein kinase 1 (CK1) family of serine/threonine-specific protein kinases. These kinases are involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, circadian rhythm, and signal transduction pathways. The CSNK1G3 gene has been studied for its role in cancer biology, particularly in lung adenocarcinoma, where its expression and derived circular RNA, circCSNK1G3, have been linked to tumor progression and metastasis (Lu2020Circular). The protein's kinase activity and its interactions with other molecular pathways underscore its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention in cancer treatment (Lu2020Circular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CSNK1G3 gene, which encodes the enzyme casein kinase 1 gamma 3, have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), the circular RNA circCSNK1G3, derived from the CSNK1G3 gene, is significantly upregulated in tumor tissues compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues. This upregulation is associated with enhanced proliferation, migration, and invasion of LUAD cells, suggesting an oncogenic role for circCSNK1G3 in LUAD progression (Lu2020Circular). The mechanism involves circCSNK1G3 acting as a molecular sponge for miR-143-3p, leading to increased expression of the HOXA10 gene, which is linked to tumor growth and metastasis (Lu2020Circular).

The study also demonstrated that silencing circCSNK1G3 or HOXA10 in LUAD cells resulted in reduced cell proliferation and migration, highlighting the potential of targeting the circCSNK1G3/miR-143-3p/HOXA10 pathway as a therapeutic strategy for LUAD (Lu2020Circular). These findings suggest that alterations in CSNK1G3 expression and its interactions can significantly contribute to the pathogenesis of lung adenocarcinoma, making it a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Lu2020Circular).
