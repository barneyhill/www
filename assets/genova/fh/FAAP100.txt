# FAAP100

## Overview
FAAP100 is a gene that encodes the FA core complex associated protein 100, a crucial component of the Fanconi anemia (FA) core complex involved in the DNA damage response pathway. The protein FAAP100 is integral to the stability and function of the FA core complex, particularly influencing the monoubiquitination of FANCD2, a critical step in DNA repair processes (Ling2007FAAP100). As a part of a subcomplex with FANCB and FANCL, FAAP100 plays a significant role in the nuclear localization and assembly of the FA core complex, thereby maintaining genomic stability (Ling2007FAAP100). Additionally, FAAP100 is involved in resolving transcription-replication conflicts and protecting replication forks, which is essential for preventing DNA damage and ensuring proper cell proliferation, especially in primordial germ cells (Xu2023FAAP100). The gene's function is vital for genomic integrity, and its disruption can lead to clinical conditions associated with genome instability and reproductive issues.

## Function
FAAP100 is a critical component of the Fanconi anemia (FA) core complex, which plays a vital role in the DNA damage response pathway. In healthy human cells, FAAP100 is essential for the stability and function of the FA core complex, particularly influencing the monoubiquitination of FANCD2, a key step in the FA pathway necessary for DNA repair (Ling2007FAAP100). FAAP100 interacts with other FA proteins, such as FANCB and FANCL, forming a subcomplex that is crucial for the stability of the entire FA core complex (Ling2007FAAP100). This subcomplex is involved in the nuclear localization and assembly of the FA core complex, which is essential for maintaining genomic stability by repairing DNA damage (Ling2007FAAP100).

FAAP100 also plays a role in resolving transcription-replication conflicts (TRCs) and protecting replication forks (RFs) during DNA replication. Its absence leads to the accumulation of R-loops and collapse of stalled RFs, resulting in double-strand breaks and genome instability (Xu2023FAAP100). This function is particularly important in primordial germ cells (PGCs), where FAAP100 helps prevent DNA damage and ensures proper cell proliferation (Xu2023FAAP100). Overall, FAAP100 is crucial for maintaining genomic integrity and preventing DNA damage in both germ and somatic cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the FAAP100 gene can lead to significant clinical consequences, particularly related to the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway. FAAP100 is a critical component of the FA core complex, which is essential for the DNA damage response. Deficiencies in FAAP100 result in defective monoubiquitination of FANCD2, a key process in the FA pathway, leading to increased sensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents and genomic instability, which are characteristic features of FA (Ling2007FAAP100).

In primordial germ cells (PGCs), FAAP100 is crucial for resolving transcription-replication conflicts and protecting replication forks. Its absence leads to increased DNA damage, genome instability, and activation of the p53 signaling pathway, resulting in PGC proliferation defects and insufficient reproductive reserve. This can manifest as hypogonadism and conditions like premature ovarian insufficiency in females and non-obstructive azoospermia in males (Xu2023FAAP100).

While no individuals with FAAP100 mutations have been identified among unclassified FA patients, the gene's role in the FA pathway suggests that such mutations could contribute to the pathophysiology of FA and related conditions involving genome instability and cancer predisposition (Ling2007FAAP100).

## Interactions
FAAP100 is a critical component of the Fanconi anemia (FA) core complex, where it interacts with several other FA proteins to facilitate DNA repair processes. It forms a stable subcomplex with FANCB and FANCL, which is essential for the stability and function of the FA core complex. This subcomplex is involved in the monoubiquitination of FANCD2, a key step in the FA pathway, and is crucial for the DNA damage response (Ling2007FAAP100).

FAAP100 interacts directly with FANCB and FANCL, and these interactions are necessary for the nuclear transport and assembly of the full FA core complex. The presence of FAAP100 in this subcomplex protects its components from proteolytic degradation and allows their coregulation by FANCA and FANCM during nuclear localization (Ling2007FAAP100).

In addition to its role in the FA core complex, FAAP100 is involved in resolving transcription-replication conflicts (TRCs) and protecting replication forks (RFs) in primordial germ cells. It interacts with FANCB and FANCL to form a scaffold for assembling other FA core complex subunits, highlighting its essential role in maintaining genome stability (Xu2023FAAP100).
