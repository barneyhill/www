# TSPY4

## Overview
TSPY4, or testis specific protein Y-linked 4, is a gene located on the Y chromosome that encodes a protein of the same name. This protein is part of the TSPY gene family, which is known for its involvement in male reproductive functions and potential roles in oncogenesis. The TSPY4 protein is categorized as a proto-oncogene, indicating its potential to contribute to cancer development under certain conditions. It is primarily expressed in the testes and has been linked to male fertility, with alterations in its expression associated with conditions such as male infertility and cryptorchidism. Additionally, TSPY4 has been implicated in various cancers, including prostate cancer and juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibromas, highlighting its dual significance in reproductive health and cancer biology (GegenschatzSchmid2019Genes; Kumari2024Comprehensive; Ponomarenko2020Disruptive).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TSPY4 gene have been linked to male infertility. Downregulation of TSPY4 is associated with an increased risk of male infertility, as indicated by clinical reports and studies predicting that overexpression of TSPY4, marked by the SNP rs1275736639, enhances male reproductive potential (Ponomarenko2020Disruptive). In cryptorchidism, a condition characterized by undescended testes, TSPY4 expression is reduced in patients with a high risk of infertility. However, treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) can increase TSPY4 mRNA levels, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach for fertility restoration in these patients (GegenschatzSchmid2019Genes).

TSPY4 is also implicated in certain cancers. It is part of the TSPY gene family, which acts as proto-oncogenes in various cancers, including prostate cancer and potentially juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibromas (JNA). Mutations in TSPY4 have been identified in JNA patients, although the specific clinical significance of these mutations requires further investigation (Kumari2024Comprehensive). The gene's role in cancer and infertility highlights its importance in both reproductive health and oncogenesis.
