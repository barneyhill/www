# AKR1B15

## Overview
AKR1B15 is a gene that encodes the protein aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B15, which is part of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily. This protein is characterized by its NADPH-dependent enzymatic activity, playing a crucial role in the reduction of aldehydes and ketones. AKR1B15 exhibits a high degree of structural similarity to AKR1B10, sharing 92% amino acid sequence identity, yet it possesses a smaller and more hydrophobic active site, which confers distinct substrate specificity and inhibitor selectivity (GiménezDejoz2015Substrate). The protein is primarily localized in the mitochondrial fraction and is expressed in various tissues, including the placenta, testes, and adipose tissues, where it contributes to aldehyde detoxification and cellular redox balance (GiménezDejoz2015Substrate). AKR1B15's involvement in retinoid metabolism and the visual cycle, particularly through its activity with retinaldehyde isomers, underscores its potential significance in metabolic processes and cellular signaling (GiménezDejoz2015Substrate).

## Structure
AKR1B15 is a member of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily, which typically features a conserved (α/β)8-barrel structure. The protein shares 92% amino acid sequence identity with AKR1B10, indicating a high degree of structural similarity (GiménezDejoz2015Substrate). The active site of AKR1B15 is smaller and more hydrophobic compared to AKR1B10, with a volume of 60 Å³, due to amino acid substitutions in loops A and C (GiménezDejoz2015Substrate). These structural differences contribute to its distinct substrate specificity and inhibitor selectivity.

AKR1B15 has two splice variant isoforms: AKR1B15.1 and AKR1B15.2. AKR1B15.1 is a 316-amino acid protein, while AKR1B15.2 has a longer N-terminus and does not exhibit enzymatic activity (Penning2015The; GiménezDejoz2015Substrate). The longer form includes a leader sequence that may affect subcellular localization, although there is no evidence of these transcripts being translated into protein isoforms (Penning2015The).

The protein is NADPH-dependent, with a cofactor-binding site that shares most residues with AKR1B10, except for Arg22, Met265, and His269, which may influence interactions with NADP+ (GiménezDejoz2015Substrate). AKR1B15 is primarily localized in the mitochondrial fraction (GiménezDejoz2015Substrate).

## Function
AKR1B15 is a member of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) family, which is involved in the reduction of aldehydes and ketones. This enzyme exhibits broad substrate specificity, displaying significant enzymatic activity towards both aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes and ketones, with a particular affinity for medium-chain carbonyl compounds (GiménezDejoz2015Substrate). AKR1B15 is notably active with retinaldehyde isomers, especially the 9-cis isomer, suggesting a role in retinoid metabolism and the visual cycle (GiménezDejoz2015Substrate).

The enzyme is NADPH-dependent and shows distinct kinetic features compared to other AKR1B enzymes, such as higher activity and lower K m values for ketones and α-dicarbonyl compounds (GiménezDejoz2015Substrate). AKR1B15 is expressed in various tissues, including the placenta, testes, and adipose tissues, and is involved in aldehyde detoxification, which may contribute to maintaining cellular redox balance (GiménezDejoz2015Substrate).

Structurally, AKR1B15 has a smaller, more hydrophobic active site compared to AKR1B10, which influences its substrate specificity and inhibitor selectivity (GiménezDejoz2015Substrate). The enzyme's activity and structural characteristics suggest it plays a role in metabolic processes and cellular signaling in healthy human cells.
