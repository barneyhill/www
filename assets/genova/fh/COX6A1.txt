# COX6A1

## Overview
The COX6A1 gene encodes the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 6A1, a component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV, also known as cytochrome c oxidase (CcO). This protein plays a pivotal role in the electron transport chain, facilitating the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to oxygen, which is essential for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation (WongRiley2000Human). The COX6A1 protein is categorized as a mitochondrial enzyme subunit and is predominantly expressed in non-muscle tissues, such as the brain, where it contributes to cellular energy metabolism and homeostasis (WongRiley2000Human). The gene's expression is regulated by transcription factors like NRF-1, NRF-2, and YY1, underscoring its role as a housekeeping gene (WongRiley2000Human). Mutations in COX6A1 have been linked to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, highlighting its clinical significance in neuromuscular function (Tamiya2014A).

## Function
The COX6A1 gene encodes a subunit of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), which is the terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This enzyme complex is crucial for oxidative phosphorylation, facilitating the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to oxygen, a process essential for ATP production in cells (WongRiley2000Human). COX6A1 specifically encodes the COX VIa-L subunit, which is active in non-muscle tissues such as the brain, and is involved in maintaining cellular energy metabolism and homeostasis (WongRiley2000Human).

The COX6A1 protein is part of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV, where it plays a role in electron transfer, a critical step in cellular respiration (Luo2020PLK1). The gene's expression is regulated by transcription factors such as NRF-1, NRF-2, and YY1, which are important for its consistent expression across different cell types, reflecting its role as a housekeeping gene (WongRiley2000Human). COX6A1 is also involved in the regulation of apoptotic pathways, potentially by interacting with components of the mitochondrial apoptosis machinery, thereby playing a protective role against reactive oxygen species-induced cell damage (Eun2008Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the COX6A1 gene are associated with a recessive axonal or mixed form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, a common inherited neuropathy characterized by muscle weakness and atrophy. A specific 5 base pair deletion in the COX6A1 gene disrupts an intronic splicing element, leading to significantly reduced expression of the normally spliced form of the gene. This reduction correlates with decreased cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity and total ATP content in peripheral white blood cells and cultured cell lines from affected individuals (Tamiya2014A).

The mutation primarily affects the peripheral nervous system, possibly due to the narrow function of the mutant allele or compensation by other isoforms like COX6A2 in other tissues. This leads to mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency, increasing the vulnerability of nerve cells (Tamiya2014A). Experiments with Cox6a1 knockout mice have shown similar reductions in COX activity and ATP content, as well as behavioral phenotypes such as difficulty in walking and thinned sciatic nerves, supporting the gene's role in neuromuscular function (Tamiya2014A).

The COX6A1 mutation may be a mutational hotspot, potentially found in families with consanguineous loops, similar to other forms of CMT (Tamiya2014A).

## Interactions
COX6A1 is a subunit of the cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) complex, which plays a critical role in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. It is involved in the assembly and stability of the CcO complex, particularly in the formation of assembly intermediates such as the S3 intermediate. COX6A1 is the last structural subunit to be incorporated into the CcO holoenzyme, indicating its essential role in completing the assembly process (Vidoni2017MR1S; Fornuskova2010Novel).

The absence of COX6A1 affects the binding of other subunits, such as Cox6b, which is thought to be involved in the dimerization of CcO (Fornuskova2010Novel). In COX6A1 knockdown cells, the incorporation of other subunits like MT-CO1 is reduced, highlighting its importance in the proper assembly of the CcO complex (Vidoni2017MR1S). COX6A1 is part of a late assembly group along with other subunits such as MT-CO3, COX6B1, and COX7A2, forming distinct modules before joining to form mature COX (Vidoni2017MR1S).

While COX6A1 is crucial for the structural stability of the CcO complex, specific physical interactions with nucleic acids are not detailed in the available literature.
