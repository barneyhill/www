# ZFP64

## Overview
ZFP64 is a gene that encodes the ZFP64 zinc finger protein, which is characterized by the presence of multiple Cys2-His2 (C2H2) zinc finger motifs. These motifs are integral to the protein's ability to bind DNA and regulate gene expression. As a transcription factor, ZFP64 plays a significant role in the innate immune response, particularly in macrophages, by modulating the production of proinflammatory cytokines and type I interferons through the activation of the NF-κB p65 subunit (Wang2013Zinc). Beyond its immunological functions, ZFP64 is implicated in cancer biology, where it interacts with key signaling pathways such as Notch and MAPK/PI3K, influencing cancer progression and chemoresistance (Zhu2022Targeting; He2023ZFP64). The protein's involvement in these pathways underscores its potential as a therapeutic target in inflammatory diseases and cancer (Zhu2022Targeting).

## Structure
ZFP64 is a zinc finger protein characterized by the presence of ten Cys2-His2 (C2H2) zinc finger motifs, which are involved in DNA binding (Mack1997A). These motifs form a compact 'finger-like' globular domain through the chelation of a zinc ion by two cysteine and two histidine residues, contributing to the protein's secondary structure (Mack1997A). The primary structure of ZFP64 consists of 614 amino acids, and the protein is predicted to have a relatively long structure with potential phosphorylation sites distributed along its length (Mack1997A).

The tertiary structure of ZFP64 is stabilized by zinc ions coordinating with cysteine and histidine residues, typical of C2H2-type zinc finger proteins (Mack1997A). ZFP64 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, with multiple potential phosphorylation sites identified, including those for casein kinase II, protein kinase C, tyrosine kinase, and c-AMP-and c-GMP-dependent protein kinase (Mack1997A). These modifications suggest regulation by protein kinases, influencing the protein's function and interactions (Mack1997A). The presence of splice variant isoforms can result in structural and functional diversity, although specific isoforms are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
ZFP64 is a zinc finger protein that plays a crucial role in the innate immune response, particularly in macrophages. It is involved in the regulation of proinflammatory cytokine and type I interferon production upon stimulation by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (Wang2013Zinc). ZFP64 functions as a positive regulator of TLR signaling by enhancing the activation of the NF-κB p65 subunit, a transcription factor essential for the expression of genes such as TNF-α, IL-6, and IFN-β (Wang2013Zinc). This protein does not significantly affect the proximal components of TLR signaling but acts downstream by associating with p65, increasing its recruitment to gene promoters, and enhancing its DNA-binding affinity (Wang2013Zinc).

ZFP64 is upregulated in macrophages upon TLR activation, and its overexpression leads to increased production of proinflammatory cytokines and type I interferons, while its silencing reduces their production (Wang2013Zinc). The protein is primarily active in the nucleus, where it binds to the promoters of target genes, facilitating their transcription in response to TLR ligation (Wang2013Zinc). This activity is crucial for a potent innate immune response and adaptive immunity against pathogens (Wang2013Zinc).

## Clinical Significance
ZFP64 has been implicated in the progression and chemoresistance of gastric cancer (GC). Overexpression of ZFP64 is associated with resistance to nab-paclitaxel, a chemotherapy drug, and is linked to adverse clinical features such as lymph node metastasis, larger tumor size, advanced pTNM stage, and shorter patient survival times. This suggests that ZFP64 may serve as an independent prognostic factor in GC (Zhu2022Targeting). Mechanistically, ZFP64 overexpression induces a stem cell-like phenotype in GC cells and contributes to an immunosuppressive microenvironment by promoting GAL-1 transcription. This is mediated through the activation of MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways, which are known to promote cancer progression (Zhu2022Targeting).

ZFP64 also plays a role in the innate immune response by enhancing the activation of the NF-κB p65 subunit, which is crucial for the production of proinflammatory cytokines and type I interferons in macrophages. This suggests that ZFP64 may influence inflammatory responses, potentially impacting diseases characterized by inflammation (Wang2013Zinc). The interaction of ZFP64 with p65 is necessary for the proper induction of TLR-mediated inflammatory responses, highlighting its role in sustaining the TLR-triggered innate immune response (Wang2013Zinc).

## Interactions
Zinc Finger Protein 64 (ZFP64) is involved in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. In gallbladder cancer, ZFP64 interacts with the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) and recruits histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) to the NUMB promoter region. This interaction leads to the deacetylation and delactylation of histones, thereby activating the Notch1 signaling pathway, which is crucial for cancer progression (He2023ZFP64).

In gastric cancer, ZFP64 acts as a transcription factor that binds to the promoter of Galectin-1 (GAL-1), promoting its transcription. This interaction is associated with the activation of the MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, contributing to a stem cell-like phenotype and an immunosuppressive microenvironment (Zhu2022Targeting).

In the context of the immune response, ZFP64 enhances the activation of the NF-κB p65 subunit in macrophages. It associates with p65, enhancing its recruitment to the promoters of proinflammatory cytokines and type I interferon genes, thus promoting their transcriptional activation (Wang2013Zinc). These interactions highlight ZFP64's role in modulating key signaling pathways and transcriptional activities.
