# TMEM199

## Overview
TMEM199 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 199, a crucial component involved in cellular processes such as vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) assembly and function. This protein is integral to maintaining the acidification of endosomal and lysosomal compartments, which is essential for cellular homeostasis and various metabolic processes. TMEM199 also plays a significant role in regulating cellular iron levels and ensuring proper glycosylation within the Golgi apparatus, thereby influencing protein modification and trafficking. Mutations in the TMEM199 gene are linked to TMEM199-congenital disorder of glycosylation (TMEM199-CDG), a rare genetic condition characterized by liver dysfunction and abnormal protein glycosylation, among other clinical manifestations (Fang2022TMEM199Congenital; Miles2017The; Vajro2018Three).

## Function
TMEM199 is a transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in the assembly and function of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) complex, which is essential for the acidification of endosomal and lysosomal compartments in human cells. This acidification is crucial for processes such as lysosomal degradation and endosomal acidification, which are necessary for cellular homeostasis and function (Miles2017The). TMEM199 is involved in the regulation of cellular iron levels by influencing the activity of prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) that hydroxylate Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1-alpha (HIF1α), marking it for degradation. Disruption of TMEM199 leads to the stabilization of HIF1α due to intracellular iron depletion, which impairs PHD activity (Miles2017The).

TMEM199 is also crucial for maintaining Golgi apparatus homeostasis, which is necessary for proper glycosylation of proteins. It ensures the correct glycosylation patterns by maintaining the pH balance within the Golgi apparatus, preventing abnormal glycosylation that can lead to liver dysfunction and other clinical manifestations (Fang2022TMEM199Congenital). TMEM199's role in the Golgi apparatus is linked to its function in the V-ATPase complex, highlighting its importance in cellular processes related to protein modification and trafficking (Vajro2018Three).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TMEM199 gene are associated with a rare genetic liver disease known as TMEM199-congenital disorder of glycosylation (TMEM199-CDG). This condition is characterized by liver disease with steatosis, elevated serum transaminases, cholesterol, and alkaline phosphatase, along with abnormal protein glycosylation (Fang2022TMEM199Congenital; Vajro2018Three). Patients with TMEM199-CDG may also present with symptoms such as intellectual disability, language retardation, hypotonia, and strabismus (Fang2022TMEM199Congenital). The disease is chronic and non-progressive, distinguishing it from other disorders that often involve both liver and brain (Vajro2018Three).

TMEM199 mutations can mimic conditions like Wilson disease, presenting with elevated aminotransferases, hypercholesterolemia, and hepatic steatosis (Espinós2020Are). These mutations lead to impaired glycosylation due to defects in Golgi homeostasis, contributing to liver dysfunction and potentially affecting the nervous and muscular systems (Fang2022TMEM199Congenital; Jansen2020Screening). The clinical phenotype of TMEM199-CDG includes liver abnormalities and glycosylation defects, with some patients exhibiting severe liver impairment, necessitating early intervention (Fang2022TMEM199Congenital; Vajro2018Three).

## Interactions
TMEM199 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a crucial role in the assembly and function of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) complex. It physically associates with V-ATPase subunits ATP6V0D1 and ATP6V0A2, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analyses (Miles2017The). TMEM199 also interacts with CCDC115, a protein with structural homology to the yeast V-ATPase assembly factor Vma22p. This interaction suggests that TMEM199 and CCDC115 form a complex at the endoplasmic reticulum, analogous to the yeast Vma12p-Vma22p V-ATPase assembly proteins (Miles2017The).

The interactions of TMEM199 with these proteins are essential for the proper functioning of the V-ATPase complex, which is involved in endolysosomal acidification and lysosomal degradation. TMEM199 and CCDC115 are necessary for the degradation of lysosomal substrates such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and MHC Class I molecules, indicating their role in V-ATPase-facilitated lysosomal degradation (Miles2017The). These interactions highlight TMEM199's involvement in maintaining cellular processes that depend on lysosomal degradation and endosomal acidification.
