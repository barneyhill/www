# CBFA2T3

## Overview
CBFA2T3 is a gene that encodes the CBFA2/RUNX1 partner transcriptional co-repressor 3 protein, also known as MTG16 or ETO2. This protein is a member of the myeloid translocation gene (MTG) family and functions primarily as a transcriptional corepressor. It plays a significant role in regulating gene expression by interacting with various corepressor complexes and histone deacetylases, thereby influencing cellular processes such as differentiation and proliferation. The CBFA2T3 protein is characterized by its four Nervy Homology Regions (NHR1-4), which facilitate interactions with other proteins and contribute to its role in transcriptional repression. Clinically, CBFA2T3 is implicated in hematological malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL), where it is associated with poor prognosis and aggressive disease phenotypes (Masetti2018CBFA2T3‐GLIS2‐positive; Bais2011CBFA2T3).

## Structure
The CBFA2T3 protein, also known as MTG16 or ETO2, is a member of the myeloid translocation gene (MTG) family and is involved in transcriptional repression. It contains four highly conserved Nervy Homology Regions (NHR1-4) at the N-terminus. NHR1 serves as a binding site for p300, a transcriptional co-activator and histone acetyltransferase, while NHR2 contains a hydrophobic heptad repeat region crucial for oligomerization, which is important for leukemic transformation (Jakobczyk2021Reduction; 1). NHR3 supports oligomerization and works with NHR4, which contains two non-DNA binding zinc fingers that interact with nuclear corepressors (Kumar2010CBFA2T3–ZNF651; 1).

CBFA2T3 is not a DNA-binding protein but can be part of a regulatory complex with RUNX1 on chromatin, potentially playing an activator role (Jakobczyk2021Reduction). The protein interacts with corepressors such as NCOR, SMRT, mSin3a, and HDACs, facilitating transcriptional repression (Jakobczyk2021Reduction; Kumar2010CBFA2T3–ZNF651). The NHR2 domain is particularly significant for its interaction with RUNX1, functioning as a tetramerization domain (Jakobczyk2021Reduction). CBFA2T3 has splice variants, including CBFA2T3A and CBFA2T3B, which differ in their exon composition and protein length (Bais2011CBFA2T3).

## Function
The CBFA2T3 gene encodes a protein that functions as a transcriptional corepressor, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. In human cells, CBFA2T3 is involved in transcriptional repression by interacting with corepressor complexes and nuclear histone deacetylases (HDACs) 1 and 3. It oligomerizes with proteins such as MTG8 and MTGR1, contributing to the methylation silencing of ribosomal DNA in the nucleolus (Bais2011CBFA2T3). CBFA2T3 also forms complexes with zinc finger proteins like ZNF651 and ZNF652, which bind to specific DNA sequences to mediate transcriptional repression (Kumar2010CBFA2T3–ZNF651).

In the colonic epithelium, CBFA2T3, also known as MTG16, regulates epithelial differentiation, colitis, and tumorigenesis by repressing E protein transcription factors. It is predominantly expressed in goblet cells and is essential for maintaining the balance between goblet and enteroendocrine cell differentiation (Brown2021MTG16). The gene's expression is upregulated in response to colitis and is necessary for colonic epithelial regeneration, highlighting its role in maintaining colonic homeostasis and protecting against tumorigenesis (Brown2021MTG16). CBFA2T3 is widely expressed in various tissues, including B-cells, brain, and muscle, and is involved in hematopoietic differentiation (Bais2011CBFA2T3).

## Clinical Significance
The CBFA2T3 gene is clinically significant due to its involvement in various hematological malignancies, particularly acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL). In AML, high expression of CBFA2T3 is associated with poor prognosis and relapse, as it is crucial for the proliferation of non-core binding factor AML cells by regulating the G1/S transition in the cell cycle (Steinauer2019Myeloid). The gene's expression is influenced by the RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion protein, which represses CBFA2T3 transcription, providing resistance to relapse in certain AML subtypes (Steinauer2019Myeloid).

In pediatric AMKL, particularly in non-Down syndrome cases, the CBFA2T3 gene forms a fusion with GLIS2 due to a cryptic inversion on chromosome 16. This CBFA2T3-GLIS2 fusion is the most prevalent and aggressive subtype of non-DS-AMKL, characterized by poor survival rates and high relapse incidence (Masetti2018CBFA2T3‐GLIS2‐positive; Gruber2012An). The fusion alters gene expression, enhancing self-renewal and blocking differentiation, which contributes to leukemogenesis (Masetti2018CBFA2T3‐GLIS2‐positive). Targeted therapies are being explored to improve outcomes for patients with this fusion (Masetti2018CBFA2T3‐GLIS2‐positive).

## Interactions
CBFA2T3, a transcriptional co-repressor, is involved in various protein interactions that facilitate its role in gene regulation. It is part of the ETO family of proteins, which are known for their transcriptional repression activities. CBFA2T3 interacts with zinc finger proteins such as ZNF652 and ZNF651 to form transcriptional repressor complexes. These interactions occur through the proline-rich region of ZNF652 and likely ZNF651, with the MYND domains (NHR4) of CBFA2T3 facilitating these interactions (Kumar2010CBFA2T3–ZNF651). The interaction with ZNF652 is particularly strong and specific, enhancing ZNF652's transcriptional repression activity (Kumar2006ZNF652).

CBFA2T3 also interacts with the transcription factor RUNX1 on chromatin, acting as a co-factor in regulatory complexes that may activate common target genes (Jakobczyk2021Reduction). This interaction is crucial for the formation of a regulatory complex on RUNX1-bound chromatin regions. Additionally, CBFA2T3 associates with histone deacetylases (HDACs) such as HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, HDAC6, and HDAC8, which are recruited to repress transcription (Kumar2006ZNF652). These interactions highlight CBFA2T3's role in transcriptional repression and its potential involvement in tumorigenesis, particularly in breast cancer (Kumar2006ZNF652).
