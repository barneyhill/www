# TBC1D30

## Overview
TBC1D30 is a gene that encodes the protein TBC1 domain family member 30, which is categorized as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP). This protein plays a critical role in cellular processes by regulating the activity of Rab GTPases, particularly Rab8A, which is involved in membrane trafficking and primary cilium formation. The TBC1D30 protein is part of a larger family of TBC domain-containing proteins that are essential for the precise control of intracellular transport and signaling pathways. Through its interaction with Rab8A, TBC1D30 influences the dynamics of ciliary structures, which are important for various cellular functions and signaling mechanisms (Fukuda2011TBC; Barr2014Rab).

## Structure


## Function


## Interactions
TBC1D30 is known to interact with Rab8A, a small GTPase involved in membrane trafficking processes. TBC1D30 functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rab8A, specifically inhibiting its activity. This interaction is significant in the context of primary cilium formation, where TBC1D30, along with TBC1D7 and EVI5L, has been shown to inhibit cilium formation in telomerase-immortalized retinal pigment epithelial cells (Fukuda2011TBC; Barr2014Rab). The interaction between TBC1D30 and Rab8A is part of a broader regulatory mechanism involving Rab GTPases and their GAPs, which are crucial for the precise control of membrane trafficking events. The specificity of TBC1D30 for Rab8A highlights its role in modulating cellular processes that depend on Rab8A activity, such as the formation and maintenance of primary cilia (Barr2014Rab). Despite challenges in determining the specificity of TBC proteins for Rab isoforms, TBC1D30's interaction with Rab8A is a key example of its functional role in cellular dynamics (Fukuda2011TBC).
