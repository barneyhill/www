# CFAP46

## Overview
CFAP46 is a gene that encodes the protein cilia and flagella associated protein 46, which is integral to the structure and function of motile cilia and flagella. This protein is primarily involved in the central apparatus of the axoneme, a key structural component of these organelles, and plays a significant role in ciliary movement and stability. CFAP46 is categorized as a structural protein due to its involvement in maintaining the integrity of the axoneme, particularly through interactions with other proteins such as SPAG6, LRRC43, and CFAP74. These interactions are crucial for the proper function of motile cilia, which are essential for various physiological processes, including respiratory function and sperm motility. Mutations in CFAP46 have been associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining normal ciliary function (Zhu2024Incell; Vandenbrouck2016Looking).

## Function
CFAP46 is a protein that plays a crucial role in the structure and function of cilia and flagella, particularly in the axoneme, which is the core structural component of these organelles. In healthy human cells, CFAP46 is involved in the central apparatus of the cilium axoneme, contributing to ciliary movement and stability. It is part of the central apparatus of the axoneme and is essential for the proper function of motile cilia, which are important for processes such as respiratory function and sperm motility (Zhu2024Incell; Vandenbrouck2016Looking).

CFAP46 interacts with other proteins such as SPAG6, LRRC43, and CFAP74, and is situated close to the heads of radial spokes RS8 and RS9, indicating its involvement in central apparatus-radial spoke interactions. This positioning suggests a role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the axoneme, which is critical for effective ciliary and flagellar movement (Zhu2024Incell).

Mutations in CFAP46 have been linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia, a condition characterized by impaired ciliary function, further underscoring its importance in maintaining normal ciliary motility and function (Zhu2024Incell; Vandenbrouck2016Looking).

## Clinical Significance
CFAP46, also known as TTC40, is implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in ciliary function. Although direct mutations in CFAP46 have not been conclusively linked to specific diseases, its involvement in ciliary and flagellar structure suggests potential associations with ciliopathies. These disorders can lead to respiratory issues, infertility, and other systemic problems due to dysfunctional cilia (Liu2018Rare).

In the context of heterotaxy syndrome, a condition characterized by abnormal organ arrangement, CFAP46 has been identified as a candidate gene. However, studies have not found functional mutations in CFAP46 directly causing the syndrome, suggesting its role may be more complex or indirect (Liu2018Rare).

CFAP46 is also mentioned in studies on neural tube defects (NTDs), where it is associated with methylation changes that could influence the Sonic Hedgehog pathway, a critical component in neural development. This suggests that epigenetic alterations in CFAP46 may contribute to the risk of NTDs, although direct mutations have not been identified (Renard2019Exome).

Additionally, CFAP46 has been noted in the context of respiratory infections, where its role in ciliary function may impact pathogen removal, potentially increasing susceptibility to infections (Baldassarri2022Gain).

## Interactions
CFAP46, also known as TTC40, is a protein involved in the structure and function of the central apparatus of cilia and flagella. It participates in several interactions within the axoneme, a core component of these organelles. CFAP46 is known to interact with proteins such as SPAG6, LRRC43, and CFAP74, although the specific nature of these linkages is not detailed (Zhu2024Incell). These interactions are situated near the heads of radial spokes RS8 and RS9, suggesting a role in central apparatus-radial spoke interactions, which are crucial for ciliary motility.

In the context of the central ciliary apparatus, CFAP46 is part of the C1d projection complex, which includes other proteins like WDR93 (also known as CFAP297), CFAP54, and CFAP221. This complex is essential for the proper assembly and function of the central pair apparatus, which is critical for ciliary and flagellar motility (Girish2023Concurrent; McKenzie2015CFAP54). The loss of CFAP46, along with WDR93, has been observed in certain bird species, indicating its importance in maintaining ciliary function and potentially affecting immune responses (Girish2023Concurrent). These interactions highlight the role of CFAP46 in maintaining the structural integrity and function of cilia and flagella.
