# GLO1

## Overview
The GLO1 gene encodes the enzyme glyoxalase I, a zinc-dependent metalloenzyme that plays a pivotal role in cellular detoxification processes. Glyoxalase I is part of the glyoxalase system, which is crucial for the conversion of methylglyoxal, a cytotoxic byproduct of glycolysis, into less harmful compounds. This enzyme is categorized as a dimeric protein and belongs to the βαβββ structural superfamily, characterized by its beta-alpha-beta fold (Honek2015Glyoxalase; Thornalley2003Glyoxalase). The GLO1 gene is ubiquitously expressed across human tissues and exhibits polymorphism, resulting in different phenotypes that may influence its enzymatic activity (Gale2004The; Thornalley2003Glyoxalase). Glyoxalase I's activity is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis by preventing the accumulation of advanced glycation end-products, which are associated with various pathological conditions, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and neurological disorders (Wortmann2014Glyoxalase; Rabbani2010Methylglyoxal).

## Structure
The human glyoxalase I (GLO1) protein is a dimeric Zn2+ metalloenzyme with a molecular mass of 42 kDa. It consists of 184 amino acids, with the N-terminal methionine removed during post-translational processing, and the N-terminal alanine is modified by an unknown process (Thornalley2003Glyoxalase). The enzyme's active site is located at the dimer interface, where it coordinates an essential zinc ion through residues Gln-33A, Glu-99A, His-126B, Glu-172B, and two water molecules in an octahedral geometry (Thornalley2003Glyoxalase). 

GLO1 belongs to the βαβββ structural superfamily, which is characterized by a beta-alpha-beta fold, a common motif in proteins with diverse biological activities (Honek2015Glyoxalase). The enzyme's tertiary structure is defined by two structurally equivalent domains in each monomer, contributing to its dimeric quaternary structure (Thornalley2003Glyoxalase). 

The GLO1 gene exhibits polymorphism, resulting in three phenotypes (GLO 1-1, GLO 1-2, and GLO 2-2) due to a diallelic gene, and it is expressed ubiquitously across human tissues (Gale2004The; Thornalley2003Glyoxalase). The protein has at least four potential phosphorylation sites, which may influence its activity and stability (Thornalley2003Glyoxalase).

## Function
Glyoxalase I (GLO1) is a crucial enzyme in the glyoxalase system, primarily active in the cytosol of most human cells. It plays a significant role in detoxifying methylglyoxal (MG), a reactive byproduct of glycolysis, by catalyzing its conversion to S-D-lactoylglutathione using glutathione (GSH) as a cofactor. This detoxification process is essential for preventing the accumulation of MG, which can lead to the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and subsequent cellular dysfunction (Wortmann2014Glyoxalase; Rabbani2010Methylglyoxal).

GLO1 activity is directly proportional to the cellular concentration of GSH, and its function is vital in maintaining cellular homeostasis by suppressing dicarbonyl-mediated glycation reactions. This enzymatic activity helps prevent apoptosis and cytotoxicity associated with MG accumulation, thereby protecting cells from oxidative stress and inflammation (Stratmann2016Glyoxalase; Rabbani2010Methylglyoxal).

In healthy human cells, GLO1 contributes to vascular health by regulating endothelial function and reducing the formation of AGEs, which are linked to various cardiovascular diseases. Its activity is crucial in preventing endothelial dysfunction and inflammation, which are associated with increased MG levels and vascular damage (Wortmann2014Glyoxalase; Stratmann2016Glyoxalase).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GLO1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In cancer, GLO1 is frequently amplified and overexpressed, contributing to tumor cell survival, proliferation, and multidrug resistance. This overexpression is particularly noted in breast, sarcomas, non-small cell lung, bladder, renal, and gastric cancers, where it supports tumor growth by enhancing methylglyoxal detoxification, a byproduct of glycolysis (Santarius2010GLO1—A; Thornalley2011Glyoxalase). Inhibiting GLO1 can increase sensitivity to chemotherapy, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Thornalley2011Glyoxalase).

In neurological disorders, GLO1 polymorphisms are associated with increased risk of schizophrenia, with specific mutations linked to reduced promoter activity and expression levels. This reduction contributes to carbonyl stress and the accumulation of advanced glycation end-products, which are implicated in the disease's etiology (Yin2021Glyoxalase). In autism, the C332 (Ala111) allele of GLO1 is associated with increased vulnerability, potentially due to reduced glyoxalase activity and increased AGE levels in the brain (Gabriele2014The).

In prostate cancer, the GLO1 2419C.A polymorphism is linked to oxidative stress and disease progression, highlighting its role in cancer pathogenesis (Antognelli2013Glyoxalase).

## Interactions
Glyoxalase I (GLO1) is a key enzyme in the glyoxalase system, primarily involved in the detoxification of methylglyoxal. It functions in conjunction with glyoxalase II (GLO2) and reduced glutathione (GSH) to convert methylglyoxal into non-toxic D-lactate. GLO1 is a metal-dependent enzyme that contains zinc ions and forms a dimeric protein structure in humans (He2020Glyoxalase).

GLO1 interacts with various proteins and regulatory elements. Its promoter region includes binding sites for transcription factors such as AP-2α, E2F4, NF-κB, AP-1, ARE, MRE, and IRE, which regulate its expression. The transcription factor Nrf2 is particularly significant, as it binds to an antioxidant response element in the GLO1 gene, enhancing its expression and providing a defense against oxidative stress and dicarbonyl glycation (Xue2012Transcriptional).

GLO1 can undergo post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA), which can influence its activity and lead to cellular responses such as caspase-dependent cell death and reactive oxygen species production (He2020Glyoxalase). These interactions highlight the enzyme's role in cellular stress responses and its potential as a therapeutic target in various diseases.
