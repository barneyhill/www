# TRAPPC10

## Overview
TRAPPC10 is a gene that encodes the protein trafficking protein particle complex subunit 10, which is a critical component of the TRAPP II complex involved in vesicular trafficking. This protein plays a significant role in the transport of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus and is essential for post-Golgi trafficking processes. TRAPPC10 contains an ASH domain, which is implicated in centrosome targeting and microtubule organization, and an N-terminal α-solenoid structure with tetratricopeptide repeats that facilitate protein-protein interactions. The protein's interactions with Rab GTPases and its role as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor underscore its importance in cellular trafficking and organization. Mutations in TRAPPC10 are linked to a severe neurodevelopmental disorder known as TRAPPopathy, characterized by microcephaly, developmental delays, and other neurological symptoms (Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:; Rawlins2022Biallelic; Schou2014Identification).

## Structure
TRAPPC10 is a subunit of the TRAPPII complex, which plays a role in vesicular trafficking and ciliary membrane biogenesis. The protein contains an ASH domain at its C-terminus, which is implicated in centrosome targeting and microtubule organization (Schou2014Identification). The ASH domain is suggested to interact with microtubules or centrosome-specific Rab GTPases, such as Rab8 (Schou2014Identification). The N-terminus of TRAPPC10 is predicted to have an α-solenoid structure with tetratricopeptide (TPR) repeats, which are involved in protein-protein interactions (Schou2014Identification).

The tertiary structure of TRAPPC10 has been modeled to be compatible with the solved 3D structure of the human OCRL1 ASH domain, reinforcing the presence of this domain in TRAPPC10 (Schou2014Identification). However, the detailed molecular structure of TRAPPC10, including its quaternary structure, remains largely unknown, and further studies are needed to elucidate how the ASH domain engages with different binding partners (Schou2014Identification). The protein's role in the TRAPPII complex suggests it may have a Rab-binding site distinct from the canonical TRAPPC4 and TRAPPC1 site (Jenkins2020The).

## Function
TRAPPC10 is a crucial component of the TRAPP II complex, which is involved in anterograde trafficking, a process essential for transporting proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus and subsequently to the plasma membrane (Rawlins2022Biallelic). This protein plays a significant role in maintaining the integrity and stability of the TRAPP II complex by interacting with other subunits such as TRAPPC2L and TRAPPC9. Variants in TRAPPC10 can lead to reduced interaction with TRAPPC2L, destabilizing the complex and causing defects in protein trafficking (Rawlins2022Biallelic).

TRAPPC10 is also implicated in post-Golgi trafficking processes, which are crucial for normal cellular function and neurodevelopment (Rawlins2022Biallelic). The protein is necessary for the incorporation of TRAPPC9 into the TRAPP II complex, highlighting its role in maintaining the complex's integrity (Rawlins2022Biallelic). In the context of cellular localization, TRAPPC10 is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it contributes to the regulation of guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity, although its exact role in ER-to-Golgi traffic may not be critical (Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:). Overall, TRAPPC10 is essential for proper cellular trafficking and organization, impacting processes like protein sorting and secretion.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TRAPPC10 gene are associated with a severe neurodevelopmental disorder known as TRAPPopathy. This condition is characterized by microcephaly, severe global developmental delay, intellectual disability, short stature, and pervasive behavioral abnormalities. Additional symptoms may include hypotonia, gait abnormalities, and seizures. The disorder is linked to disruptions in the TRAPP II/III complex functions, which are crucial for Golgi trafficking processes (Rawlins2022Biallelic).

In a study involving a large Pakistani family, a frameshift variant in TRAPPC10 was identified as the likely cause of a disorder characterized by severe microcephaly, short stature, intellectual impairment, speech impairment, and behavioral abnormalities, including autistic features and aggressive episodes. Some affected individuals also experienced seizures, and neuroimaging revealed microcephaly with corpus callosum thinning (Rawlins2022Biallelic).

TRAPPC10 mutations result in reduced interaction with TRAPPC2L and destabilization of the TRAPP II complex, leading to anterograde trafficking defects. These mutations disrupt cellular trafficking processes, contributing to the observed neurodevelopmental disorder (Rawlins2022Biallelic). The absence of TRAPPC10 is also associated with a loss of TRAPPC9, suggesting TRAPPC10's role in TRAPP II complex stability (Rawlins2022Biallelic).

## Interactions
TRAPPC10 is a component of the TRAPP II complex, which plays a crucial role in vesicle-mediated transport. It interacts with several other proteins within this complex, including TRAPPC2L and TRAPPC9. Variants in TRAPPC10, such as p.Gly1131Valfs and p.Pro929Leu, have been shown to reduce its interaction with TRAPPC2L, leading to destabilization of the TRAPP II complex and defects in anterograde trafficking (Rawlins2022Biallelic). The absence of TRAPPC10 results in a concomitant absence of TRAPPC9, indicating a close inter-relationship between these proteins (Rawlins2022Biallelic).

TRAPPC10 also interacts with Rab GTPases, which are crucial for its function as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) within the TRAPPII complex. It has been suggested that TRAPPC10 may mediate a Rab-binding site distinct from the canonical TRAPPC4 and TRAPPC1 binding site, facilitated by its Longin domain (Jenkins2020The). This interaction is important for the TRAPPII complex's activity against Rab1, Rab11, Rab19, and Rab43 (Jenkins2020The).

Additionally, TRAPPC10 is involved in the activation of the Rab11-Rabin8-Rab8 axis, which is essential for ciliary membrane biogenesis. It associates with Rabin8 to ensure its targeting to the centrosome, highlighting its role in late Golgi vesicle tethering (Schou2014Identification).
