# PSMG2

## Overview
PSMG2 is a gene that encodes the protein proteasome assembly chaperone 2, also known as PAC2, which is integral to the assembly and maturation of the 20S proteasome. The 20S proteasome is a core component of the proteasome complex, responsible for degrading ubiquitinated proteins, thus playing a critical role in maintaining protein homeostasis within the cell. PSMG2 functions as a chaperone, forming a heterodimer with PAC1 (encoded by PSMG1) to facilitate the correct assembly of the proteasome's alpha-subunits into the 20S proteasome. This process is essential for preventing improper dimerization and aggregation of alpha-ring intermediates, ensuring the proteasome's structural and functional integrity (Bedford2010Assembly; de2019Novel). PSMG2 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it contributes to various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and stress responses (Sbardella2020Defective).

## Function
PSMG2, also known as proteasome assembly chaperone 2, plays a crucial role in the assembly and maturation of the 20S proteasome, a core component of the proteasome complex responsible for degrading ubiquitinated proteins. In healthy human cells, PSMG2 encodes the chaperone PAC2, which dimerizes with PAC1 (encoded by PSMG1) to form the PAC1/PAC2 complex. This complex is essential for incorporating the proteasome alpha-subunits into the full 20S proteasome, ensuring proper proteasome assembly and function (de2019Novel).

The proteasome is a cylindrical structure composed of four stacked rings, with alpha-subunits forming the outer rings and beta-subunits forming the inner rings. PSMG2, as part of the PAC1-PAC2 heterodimer, assists in the early stages of proteasome assembly by preventing off-pathway dimerization and aggregation of alpha-ring intermediates, thus facilitating the recruitment of additional subunits to form a mature alpha-ring (Bedford2010Assembly).

PSMG2 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to processes such as cell cycle regulation and stress responses. Its proper function is vital for maintaining protein homeostasis and cellular regulation, impacting various cellular functions, including cell-cycle control, DNA repair, and signal transduction (Sbardella2020Defective).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PSMG2 gene, which encodes the proteasome assembly chaperone PAC2, have been implicated in the development of CANDLE/PRAAS4, a rare autoinflammatory interferonopathy. These mutations result in a loss-of-function effect, leading to impaired proteasome assembly and activity. Clinically, patients with these mutations exhibit symptoms such as panniculitis, generalized lipodystrophy, and autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). The impaired proteasome function is due to reduced binding of the mutant PAC1/PAC2 heterodimer to the proteasome core's α-subunit, causing decreased proteolytic activities and accumulation of ubiquitin conjugates in fibroblast lysates (de2019Novel).

In the context of cancer, PSMG2 is overexpressed in a majority of the 16 cancer types analyzed in a pan-cancer study, suggesting a potential role in cancer-related processes. However, specific clinical significance regarding mutations or interactions of PSMG2 in cancer is not detailed (Larsson2022Pancancer).

Additionally, a point mutation in PSMG2 has been associated with drug resistance in multiple myeloma, although the specific clinical implications of this mutation are not extensively detailed (Progress; p&gt; Hu2019&lt).

## Interactions
PSMG2, also known as proteasome assembly chaperone 2, plays a critical role in the assembly and maturation of the 20S proteasome complex. It interacts with other chaperones and proteasome subunits to facilitate the proper folding and assembly of the proteasome. PSMG2 forms a complex with PAC1 (PSMG1) to assist in the incorporation of proteasome α-subunits into the full 20S proteasome. This interaction is crucial for preventing off-pathway dimerization and aggregation, ensuring the correct assembly of the proteasome core particle (Sbardella2020Defective; de2019Novel).

In the context of Rett Syndrome, PSMG2, along with PAC1, is downregulated, leading to defective proteasome biogenesis. This downregulation affects the assembly of proteasome subunits, particularly the α-ring, which is essential for the formation of the 20S proteasome core particle (Sbardella2020Defective).

PSMG2 is also involved in proteasome maturation, as identified in studies exploring proteasome interacting proteins. It is noted for its role in the maturation process, although specific interactions with other proteins in this context are not detailed (Postic2020Probing).
