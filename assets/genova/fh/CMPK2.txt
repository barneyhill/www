# CMPK2

## Overview
CMPK2, or cytidine/uridine monophosphate kinase 2, is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial enzyme involved in nucleotide metabolism. The protein product of CMPK2 is a kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation of cytidine and uridine monophosphates, playing a vital role in the synthesis of nucleotides necessary for DNA and RNA production, particularly within mitochondria. This enzyme is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial DNA integrity and function, as well as supporting cellular energy metabolism. CMPK2 is expressed in various tissues, with notable expression in neurons and macrophages, where it contributes to energy metabolism and immune response regulation. The protein also participates in antiviral defense mechanisms, interacting with other proteins to inhibit viral replication. Mutations in the CMPK2 gene have been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and familial brain calcification, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining mitochondrial and immune system health (Zhao2022Loss; Kim2021UMPCMP; Carecchio2023The).

## Function
CMPK2, or cytidine/uridine monophosphate kinase 2, is a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a critical role in nucleotide metabolism by catalyzing the phosphorylation of cytidine and uridine monophosphates to their diphosphate forms. This activity is essential for the synthesis of nucleotides necessary for DNA and RNA production, particularly in the context of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication and maintenance (Zhao2022Loss; Xu2008Human). CMPK2 is involved in the salvage pathway of dUTP and dCTP production, which are crucial for maintaining mitochondrial genome integrity and function (Zhao2022Loss).

In healthy human cells, CMPK2 is ubiquitously expressed, with significant expression in neurons and macrophages, where it contributes to energy metabolism and immune response regulation (Zhao2022Loss; Kim2021UMPCMP). The enzyme is localized in the mitochondria, where it helps maintain mitochondrial DNA copy numbers, ATP production, and intracellular phosphate homeostasis, thereby supporting normal cellular energy metabolism and preventing mitochondrial dysfunction (Zhao2022Loss). CMPK2's role in immune response is highlighted by its induction in macrophages upon activation by TLR ligands, suggesting its involvement in modulating immune responses and maintaining macrophage homeostasis (Kim2021UMPCMP; Arumugam2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CMPK2 gene have been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and brain calcification, particularly in familial brain calcification (FBC). Biallelic variants such as c.2 T > C, c.1 A > C, and c.1241 A > G have been identified in patients, leading to disrupted mitochondrial functions and contributing to the pathogenesis of brain calcification (Zhao2022Loss). These mutations result in reduced mitochondrial DNA copy numbers, downregulated mitochondrial protein expression, decreased ATP production, and abnormal intracellular phosphate levels, which are associated with progressive intracranial calcification (Zhao2022Loss; Carecchio2023The).

In Cmpk2-knockout mice, these mutations mimic human conditions, showing brain calcification and mitochondrial dysfunction, including impaired cristae architecture and reduced cytochrome C levels (Zhao2022Loss). Clinically, patients with CMPK2 mutations may present with symptoms such as ataxia, dysarthria, motor dysfunction, and cognitive decline, often starting in the third to fourth decade of life (Carecchio2023The).

CMPK2 also plays a role in inflammation regulation. Alterations in its expression can disrupt macrophage homeostasis, leading to increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and affecting immune responses (Arumugam2022The). This suggests that CMPK2 is crucial for maintaining both mitochondrial and immune system functions.

## Interactions
CMPK2, or cytidine/uridine monophosphate kinase 2, is involved in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, contributing to its role in antiviral defense mechanisms. CMPK2 interacts with Viperin, an interferon-stimulated protein, to catalyze the production of 3'-deoxy-3',4'-didehydro-cytidine triphosphate (ddhCTP). This interaction is crucial for CMPK2's antiviral activity against coronaviruses, as ddhCTP acts as a chain terminator for viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), inhibiting viral replication (Zhu2023CMPK2).

CMPK2's interaction with Viperin is particularly significant in the context of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection, where CMPK2 provides CTP as a substrate for Viperin to produce ddhCTP, thereby reducing viral replication (Zhu2023CMPK2). However, this interaction does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication, possibly due to a lack of metabolism to ddhCTP or inactivity against SARS-CoV-2 (Zhu2023CMPK2).

In the context of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection, CMPK2's antiviral activity is independent of its kinase function and is mediated by its N-terminal domain, which may interact with RNA-binding proteins or release a product that binds to specific RNA sequences, inhibiting viral translation (Pawlak2023CMPK2).
