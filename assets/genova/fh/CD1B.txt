# CD1B

## Overview
The CD1B gene encodes the CD1b molecule, a nonpolymorphic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-like glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in the immune system by presenting lipid and glycolipid antigens to T cells. This transmembrane protein is primarily expressed on antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages, and is involved in the recognition of microbial lipids, including those with long alkyl chains like mycolic acid. The CD1b molecule is characterized by its unique antigen-binding groove, which contains hydrophobic channels that accommodate various lipid ligands, facilitating the immune response against intracellular pathogens (Van2015Lipid; Gadola2002Structure). The gene's expression and function are clinically significant, as alterations can impact immune responses and are implicated in diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lysosomal storage disorders (Kim2023CD1mediated; Pereira2019Lipid).

## Structure
The CD1B protein is a nonpolymorphic major histocompatibility complex class I-like glycoprotein involved in presenting lipid antigens to T lymphocytes. It consists of a heavy chain and a β2-microglobulin light chain, forming a heterodimeric structure. The heavy chain includes three extracellular domains: α1, α2, and α3, which are crucial for forming the antigen-binding groove. This groove is characterized by a network of hydrophobic channels labeled A', C', F', and T', which accommodate the alkyl chains of lipid ligands (Ernst1998Molecular; Gadola2002Structure).

The α1 and α2 domains form the antigen-binding superdomain, which is highly hydrophobic and designed to bind long hydrocarbon chains. The structure of CD1B is unique among CD1 molecules, with a superchannel capable of binding long fatty acid chains, such as mycolic acid (Gadola2002Structure). The protein's secondary structure includes α-helical regions, which undergo pH-induced conformational changes that may facilitate antigen interaction (Ernst1998Molecular).

Post-translational modifications of CD1B may include glycosylation, which is common in proteins of this family (Castillo2004Identifying). The structural features of CD1B allow it to present a wide range of lipid antigens, contributing to its role in immune responses.

## Function
The CD1B gene encodes the CD1b molecule, a nonpolymorphic MHC class I-like glycoprotein involved in the presentation of lipid and glycolipid antigens to T cells. CD1b is primarily expressed on antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells and macrophages, where it plays a crucial role in the immune response by facilitating the recognition of microbial lipids (Van2015Lipid; Reijneveld2020Human).

CD1b is involved in presenting lipid antigens, including microbial lipids with long alkyl chains, such as mycolic acid, and endogenous gangliosides like GM1, to T cells. This process is facilitated by the unique structure of CD1b, which includes a binding groove with hydrophobic channels that accommodate various lipid ligands (Batuwangala2004The; Gadola2002Structure). The antigen-binding groove of CD1b is partitioned into channels that can accommodate lengthy acyl chains, allowing it to bind natural bacterial lipid antigens (Batuwangala2004The).

CD1b's ability to present lipid antigens is crucial for immune recognition and response, particularly in the context of intracellular pathogens. It is involved in both innate and adaptive immunity, with its expression being upregulated during inflammation-induced monocyte differentiation, promoting the activation of γδ T cells involved in innate stress surveillance (Reijneveld2020Human).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the CD1B gene have been implicated in various diseases. In respiratory diseases, increased CD1b expression in alveolar macrophages and monocyte-derived macrophages is associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), potentially contributing to its pathogenesis by altering the lipid repertoire and stimulating CD1b-restricted T cell responses (Kim2023CD1mediated). In the context of lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) such as Niemann-Pick type C (NPC), monocyte-derived dendritic cells from patients exhibit a higher capacity to present the antigen GM1 through CD1b, suggesting a functional alteration in antigen presentation (Pereira2019Lipid).

In abetalipoproteinemia (ABL), a genetic disorder characterized by microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) deficiency, there is a significant reduction in CD1b expression due to increased proteasomal degradation, leading to impaired antigen presentation (Zeissig2010Primary). CD1b expression is also noted in autoimmune and inflammatory conditions such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, where it may play a role in disease pathology (Brigl2004CD1:). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CD1B in various diseases, where its altered expression or function can impact immune responses.

## Interactions
The CD1b molecule is involved in several key interactions that facilitate its role in antigen presentation. CD1b interacts with adaptor protein complexes, specifically AP-2 and AP-3, which are crucial for its intracellular trafficking. The interaction with AP-2 is mediated by a tyrosine-based motif in the CD1b cytoplasmic tail, which is essential for its internalization from the cell surface via clathrin-coated pits and vesicles (Briken2002Intracellular). This process is less efficient than that of the transferrin receptor but more efficient than MHC class I molecules. The AP-3 complex is suggested to play a role in sorting CD1b for lysosomal transport, although CD1b has a lower affinity for AP-3 compared to AP-2 (Briken2002Intracellular).

CD1b also forms complexes with T-cell receptors (TCRs) on T cells, particularly in the context of presenting lipid antigens. The GEM42 TCR, for example, binds to CD1b presenting a mycobacterial glycolipid with high affinity, involving extensive contact with the CD1b molecule (Gras2016T). The BC8B TCR interacts with CD1b when loaded with phospholipid antigens, forming a unique binding mechanism that allows for broad T-cell responses (Shahine2019A). These interactions highlight the versatility of CD1b in engaging with different TCRs and facilitating immune responses.
