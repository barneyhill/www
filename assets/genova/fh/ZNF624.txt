# ZNF624

## Overview
ZNF624 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 624, which is part of the zinc finger protein family known for their role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which facilitate their interaction with DNA, RNA, or other proteins, thereby influencing various cellular processes. The specific functions of zinc finger protein 624 remain to be fully elucidated, but it is implicated in transcriptional regulation due to its structural characteristics. ZNF624 has garnered interest in the field of oncology, as it has been identified as a potential driver gene in certain cancers, including bladder cancer and clear cell renal cell carcinoma, although its precise role in these diseases is not yet fully understood (Jiang2019WITER:; Yang2017A). Additionally, machine learning approaches have identified ZNF624 as an up-regulated gene in pituitary tumors, suggesting a possible involvement in tumorigenesis (Wang2023Machine).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZNF624 has been identified as a gene with potential clinical significance in various cancers, although its role is not yet fully understood. In bladder cancer (BLCA), ZNF624 is considered a potential driver gene due to the presence of 19 non-synonymous mutations and a high functional gene score, suggesting its involvement in the disease's progression (Jiang2019WITER:). Despite this, the gene has not been extensively studied, and there is limited literature documenting its clinical significance in bladder cancer or other diseases.

In kidney cancer, specifically clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), ZNF624 is associated with differentially expressed gene modules (DGMs). However, the specific clinical implications of ZNF624 mutations in ccRCC remain unclear, as the study primarily focuses on other genes with more established roles in the disease (Yang2017A).

In pituitary tumors, ZNF624 is one of the up-regulated genes identified through machine learning techniques. The study highlights the importance of understanding the regulatory mechanisms and immune cell infiltration in these tumors, but it does not provide detailed information on the clinical significance of ZNF624 mutations (Wang2023Machine).
