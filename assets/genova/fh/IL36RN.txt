# IL36RN

## Overview
The IL36RN gene encodes the interleukin-36 receptor antagonist (IL-36Ra), a protein that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of immune responses. IL-36Ra is categorized as a cytokine antagonist, specifically inhibiting the activity of interleukin-36 cytokines. This protein functions by binding to the interleukin-36 receptor (IL-36R), thereby preventing the recruitment of the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) and subsequent pro-inflammatory signaling pathways. The IL36RN gene is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive inflammatory responses, particularly in skin biology, where it helps to avert conditions such as psoriasis (Keller2024Molecular; Towne2011Interleukin-36). Mutations in this gene are linked to several inflammatory skin disorders, underscoring its clinical significance in dermatological health (Sugiura2013The; Liang2016Mutations).

## Function
The IL36RN gene encodes the interleukin-36 receptor antagonist (IL-36Ra), a crucial protein in regulating immune responses by inhibiting the activity of IL-36 cytokines. In healthy human cells, IL-36Ra functions as an anti-inflammatory agent by blocking the engagement of the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP), thereby inhibiting pro-inflammatory signaling (Keller2024Molecular; Towne2011Interleukin-36). This inhibition is essential for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive tissue damage (Keller2024Molecular).

IL-36Ra is inactive as a precursor and requires the removal of the N-terminal methionine to become active, a process mediated by methionyl aminopeptidases such as neutrophil elastase (Keller2024Molecular). The protein binds to the IL-1Rrp2 receptor, preventing the association with IL-1RAcP, which is necessary for signaling, thus acting as an antagonist to IL-36 cytokines (Towne2011Interleukin-36). This mechanism is similar to how IL-1Ra inhibits IL-1α and IL-1β (Towne2011Interleukin-36).

IL-36Ra's role is particularly significant in skin biology, where it helps maintain skin homeostasis and prevent inflammatory conditions such as psoriasis (Gabay2015Regulation; Towne2011Interleukin-36).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IL36RN gene are associated with several inflammatory skin conditions, most notably generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP). GPP is characterized by episodic sterile pustules on an erythematous background and can be life-threatening. IL36RN mutations, particularly homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations, are frequently found in GPP cases without psoriasis vulgaris (PV), suggesting a distinct subtype of the disease caused by a deficiency of the interleukin-36 receptor antagonist (DITRA) (Sugiura2013The). These mutations lead to abnormal IL-36 receptor signaling, resulting in skin inflammation (Sugiura2013The).

IL36RN mutations are also linked to acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP), and acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau (ACH) (Sugiura2014The). In some cases, these mutations are associated with geographic tongue (GT), a benign inflammatory disorder of the tongue, suggesting a potential genetic risk factor for GT and its association with GPP (Liang2016Mutations).

The presence of IL36RN mutations can lead to severe systemic symptoms, including fever, leukocytosis, and hypoalbuminemia, and is associated with specific clinical features such as geographic tongue (Trai2022Correlation).

## Interactions
The IL36RN gene encodes the interleukin-36 receptor antagonist (IL-36Ra), which primarily interacts with the interleukin-36 receptor (IL-36R) to inhibit pro-inflammatory signaling. IL-36Ra competitively binds to the extracellular Ig domains of IL-36R, preventing the recruitment of the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) and the subsequent formation of a functional signaling complex. This interaction effectively blocks the downstream signaling pathways that would otherwise be activated by IL-36 cytokines, such as MAP kinases and NF-kappaB, thereby modulating inflammatory responses (Neurath2020IL36; Walsh2016The).

IL-36Ra also interacts with other receptors, such as SIGIRR, which was previously considered an orphan receptor within the IL-1 receptor family. In brain cells, the binding of IL-36Ra to SIGIRR inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 and prevents the phosphorylation of transcription factors like pJNK. This interaction also triggers the production of the immunomodulatory cytokine IL-4, although this effect is specific to cells in the central nervous system (Chelvanambi2020IL36). These interactions highlight the role of IL-36Ra in regulating inflammation and maintaining immune homeostasis.
