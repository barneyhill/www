# ATP1A1

## Overview
The ATP1A1 gene encodes the alpha-1 subunit of the Na+/K+ ATPase, a transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in maintaining the electrochemical gradients of sodium and potassium ions across the plasma membrane. This protein is essential for various physiological processes, including nerve impulse transmission, muscle contraction, and osmoregulation. The Na+/K+ ATPase functions as an ion pump, actively transporting sodium and potassium ions in a process driven by ATP hydrolysis (Kaplan2002Biochemistry). Beyond its primary role in ion transport, the protein encoded by ATP1A1 is involved in signal transduction and cellular processes such as macropinocytosis, which is significant in the context of viral infections (Lingemann2019The). Mutations in ATP1A1 have been implicated in several clinical conditions, including renal hypomagnesemia, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and hereditary spastic paraplegia, underscoring its importance in both health and disease (Cinarli2023The; Schlingmann2018Germline; Stregapede2019Hereditary).

## Structure
The ATP1A1 gene encodes the alpha 1 subunit of the Na+/K+ ATPase, a transmembrane protein crucial for maintaining sodium and potassium ion gradients across the cell membrane. The primary structure of ATP1A1 consists of a sequence of 1,023 amino acids (Lin2021ATP1A1). The secondary structure includes ten transmembrane helices, which are integral to its function as an ion pump (Lin2021ATP1A1; Clausen2017The). 

The tertiary structure of ATP1A1 is characterized by three cytoplasmic domains: the nucleotide-binding (N), phosphorylation (P), and actuator (A) domains. These domains are essential for the catalytic cycle of the Na+/K+ ATPase, facilitating ATP hydrolysis and ion transport (Clausen2017The). The P-domain contains a conserved aspartate residue that undergoes phosphorylation and dephosphorylation during the cycle (Clausen2017The).

In terms of quaternary structure, ATP1A1 forms a heterodimer with beta and FXYD subunits, creating a functional pump (Clausen2017The). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a role in regulating its activity (Sweadner2019Genotypestructurephenotype). Variants in ATP1A1 can lead to altered function, contributing to various disorders (Lin2021ATP1A1).

## Function
The ATP1A1 gene encodes the alpha-1 subunit of the Na+/K+-ATPase, a crucial membrane protein responsible for maintaining the electrochemical gradients of sodium and potassium ions across the plasma membrane. This ion pump actively transports three sodium ions out of the cell and two potassium ions into the cell, a process powered by the hydrolysis of ATP (Kaplan2002Biochemistry). The Na+/K+-ATPase is essential for various cellular functions, including nerve impulse transmission, muscle contraction, and osmoregulation (Kaplan2002Biochemistry).

In addition to its role in ion transport, ATP1A1 is involved in signal transduction and cellular processes such as macropinocytosis, which is a mechanism for viral entry, as seen in the context of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection (Lingemann2019The). The protein also interacts with cellular kinases like c-Src, activating signaling pathways that can influence endocytosis and blood pressure regulation (Lingemann2019The).

ATP1A1 is expressed in most tissues, with significant activity in the kidneys and nervous system, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and overall organismal health (Stregapede2019Hereditary).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATP1A1 gene, which encodes the alpha-1 subunit of the Na+/K+ ATPase, are associated with a range of clinical conditions. Germline de novo mutations in ATP1A1 can lead to a condition characterized by renal hypomagnesemia, refractory seizures, and intellectual disability. These mutations disrupt the function of the Na+/K+ ATPase, leading to abnormal ion permeability and disturbances in intracellular sodium and potassium levels, which are critical for neuronal and muscular functions (Schlingmann2018Germline).

ATP1A1 mutations have also been linked to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 (CMT2), a hereditary neuropathy. Specific mutations, such as p.P600R, are associated with demyelinating forms of CMT, characterized by muscle weakness, sensory loss, and peripheral neuropathy. These mutations result in reduced Na+/K+ ATPase activity, contributing to the pathogenesis of the disease (Cinarli2023The).

Additionally, ATP1A1 mutations can cause hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), expanding the phenotypic spectrum of ATP1A1-related disorders. This condition is marked by motor developmental delay and spastic gait, further illustrating the gene's role in both central and peripheral nervous system disorders (Stregapede2019Hereditary).

## Interactions
ATP1A1, the alpha-1 subunit of the Na+/K+-ATPase, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It forms a heterodimeric complex with the beta subunit, which is essential for the enzyme's maturation and stability, facilitating its correct insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and delivery to the plasma membrane (Zacherl2015A). ATP1A1 also interacts with fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) at the plasma membrane, where it plays a role in the unconventional secretion of FGF2. This interaction occurs at the cytoplasmic domains CD2 and CD3 of ATP1A1, as demonstrated by pull-down assays (Zacherl2015A).

In the context of viral infections, ATP1A1 is critical for the macropinocytic entry of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) into human respiratory epithelial cells. It clusters in the plasma membrane early after RSV infection, a process dependent on the RSV attachment glycoprotein G, and activates signaling through c-Src kinase, which transactivates the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (Lingemann2019The). ATP1A1 also interacts with Src kinase in glioma stem cells, promoting cell survival and proliferation by activating the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways (Yu2019ATP1A1). These interactions highlight ATP1A1's role in both physiological and pathological processes.
