# ARMC9

## Overview
ARMC9 is a gene that encodes the protein armadillo repeat containing 9, which is integral to various cellular processes, particularly those involving ciliary function and cell cycle regulation. The ARMC9 protein is characterized by its armadillo repeats, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, and is categorized as a ciliary protein due to its significant role in maintaining the structure and function of primary cilia. It is involved in the regulation of ciliary length and stability, interacting with other proteins such as TOGARAM1 and CSPP1, which are crucial for ciliary function. Additionally, ARMC9 plays a role in cell cycle progression and glucose metabolism, highlighting its multifaceted importance in cellular health. Mutations in the ARMC9 gene are linked to Joubert syndrome, a ciliopathy that underscores the gene's clinical significance in neurodevelopmental disorders (Van2017Mutations; Latour2020Dysfunction).

## Structure
The ARMC9 protein is characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function. It contains an N-terminal LisH domain, a coiled-coil domain, and a series of armadillo repeats. The LisH domain is associated with microtubule dynamics and cell division, while the coiled-coil domain and armadillo repeats are often involved in protein-protein interactions (Van2017Mutations; Latour2020Dysfunction). The armadillo repeats form a substantial binding platform, typically consisting of tandem repeats approximately 42 amino acids in length, which contribute to the protein's secondary structure by forming a series of alpha-helices (Huang2021ARMC; Gul2016Metazoan).

The tertiary structure of ARMC9 is influenced by these repeats, facilitating interactions with other cellular proteins. The protein has a propensity to multimerize, as indicated by its self-binding capability (Latour2020Dysfunction). ARMC9 is part of a ciliary module and interacts with proteins such as TOGARAM1, CCDC66, and CSPP1, which are crucial for ciliary function (Latour2019ARMC9; Latour2020Dysfunction). The protein's structure is crucial for its role in ciliary stability, as dysfunction can lead to ciliopathy phenotypes (Latour2020Dysfunction).

## Function
ARMC9 is a protein involved in several critical cellular processes in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in ciliary function, particularly in the maintenance and stability of primary cilia, which are essential for cellular signaling and sensory functions. ARMC9 localizes to the ciliary basal body and is upregulated during ciliogenesis, indicating its involvement in cilia formation and function (Latour2019ARMC9; Van2017Mutations). It interacts with proteins such as TOGARAM1 to regulate axonemal post-translational modifications and cilium stability, which are crucial for maintaining proper ciliary structure and function (Huang2021ARMC; Latour2019ARMC9).

ARMC9 also plays a role in cell cycle regulation. The N-terminus of ARMC9, similar to GID8, interacts with DCR2 and phosphatase CLN3 or SWI4 to promote cell cycle progression. It is involved in regulating microtubules, spindle pole bodies, and nuclear integrity, which are essential for mitosis (Huang2021ARMC). Additionally, ARMC9 is implicated in glucose metabolism by mediating the degradation of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, thus contributing to glucose homeostasis (Huang2021ARMC). These functions highlight ARMC9's multifaceted role in cellular processes and its importance in maintaining cellular health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ARMC9 gene are associated with Joubert syndrome (JBTS), a rare neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a distinctive brain malformation known as the 'molar tooth sign' on axial MRIs. This condition is part of a group of disorders known as ciliopathies, which are caused by defects in the structure or function of primary cilia. ARMC9 mutations lead to shorter cilia and decreased ciliary stability, contributing to the clinical manifestations of JBTS, which include hypotonia, ataxia, abnormal eye movements, and cognitive impairment (Latour2019ARMC9; Latour2020Dysfunction).

The ARMC9 gene forms a complex with other JBTS-associated proteins, such as TOGARAM1, CSPP1, and CEP290, which is crucial for regulating axonemal post-translational modifications and cilium stability. Disruption of this complex due to ARMC9 mutations affects ciliary function and stability, leading to the pathogenesis of JBTS (Latour2019ARMC9; Latour2020Dysfunction). In zebrafish models, ARMC9 mutations result in phenotypes typical of ciliopathies, such as pronephric cysts and scoliosis, further supporting its role in ciliary function (Van2017Mutations). These findings underscore the importance of ARMC9 in maintaining ciliary integrity and its impact on JBTS.

## Interactions
ARMC9 is involved in several protein interactions, particularly in the context of Joubert syndrome (JBTS), a neurodevelopmental ciliopathy. It forms a complex with proteins such as TOGARAM1, CCDC66, CEP104, and CSPP1, which are associated with ciliary function. These interactions have been confirmed through various methods, including tandem affinity purification and yeast two-hybrid screens (Latour2019ARMC9; Latour2020Dysfunction). The ARMC9-TOGARAM1 complex is crucial for regulating ciliary length and stability, with TOGARAM1 directly interacting with ARMC9 through its TOG2 domain (Latour2019ARMC9; Latour2020Dysfunction).

ARMC9 also interacts with other JBTS-associated proteins like CEP290 and RPGRIP1L, forming a network that is essential for cilium stability and axonemal post-translational modifications (Latour2020Dysfunction). The interaction between ARMC9 and TOGARAM1 is particularly significant, as mutations in either protein can lead to shorter cilia and decreased ciliary stability, contributing to the pathomechanisms of JBTS (Latour2020Dysfunction). These interactions highlight the role of ARMC9 in ciliogenesis and its importance in maintaining ciliary structure and function (Latour2020Dysfunction).
