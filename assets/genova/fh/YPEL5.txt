# YPEL5

## Overview
YPEL5 is a gene that encodes the protein yippee-like 5, which is part of the Yippee-like family of proteins. This protein is primarily involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, playing a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability and normal cell division processes. Yippee-like 5 is localized in the nucleus and centrosome during interphase and relocates to the spindle pole and mitotic spindle during the M phase, indicating its involvement in cell division (Lee2017ProApoptotic). The protein has been shown to have pro-apoptotic functions, particularly in mitochondria-dependent apoptosis, and its overexpression can reduce cell proliferation, suggesting a tumor suppressor role (Wu2018Upregulation; Lee2017ProApoptotic). YPEL5 is also implicated in various cellular interactions and pathways, including the PPAR α signaling pathway in liver development and the METTL3/YTHDF2 m6A axis in cancer progression (Zhou2021METTL3YTHDF2; Deng2023Ypel5). Alterations in YPEL5 expression have been associated with several cancers, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Wang2022Comprehensive; Velusamy2013Recurrent).

## Function
YPEL5 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. In healthy human cells, YPEL5 is ubiquitously expressed and its protein product is localized in the nucleus and centrosome during interphase, relocating to the spindle pole and mitotic spindle during the M phase (Lee2017ProApoptotic). This localization suggests a role in cell division, particularly in maintaining genomic stability and normal cell division processes.

The pro-apoptotic role of YPEL5 has been demonstrated through studies using yeast models, where the human YPEL5 gene restored sensitivity to apoptogenic stimulants, indicating its involvement in mitochondria-dependent apoptosis (Lee2017ProApoptotic). In human cells, overexpression of YPEL5 has been shown to significantly reduce cell proliferation, suggesting a suppressive effect on cell growth (Lee2017ProApoptotic).

YPEL5 is also implicated in the regulation of cell cycle progression and DNA damage-induced apoptosis, as observed in cancer studies, although these findings may provide insights into its general functions in healthy cells as well (Wu2018Upregulation). Despite these findings, the specific molecular mechanisms and physiological functions of YPEL5 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the YPEL5 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), YPEL5 is significantly downregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. Higher expression levels of YPEL5 are associated with better overall survival and disease-specific survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker. Knockdown of YPEL5 promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, indicating its role as a tumor suppressor in ccRCC (Wang2022Comprehensive).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), YPEL5 expression is epigenetically suppressed by the METTL3/YTHDF2/m6A axis, leading to decreased mRNA and protein levels. This suppression is associated with increased tumor progression, as METTL3 overexpression enhances CRC cell proliferation and migration. The downregulation of YPEL5 by METTL3-mediated m6A modification contributes to CRC tumorigenesis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhou2021METTL3YTHDF2).

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), YPEL5 is involved in the formation of chimeric RNA transcripts with PPP1CB, which are selectively expressed in neoplastic CLL cells. These chimeras may contribute to CLL pathogenesis by affecting protein expression and function, underscoring the significance of RNA splicing events in cancer (Velusamy2013Recurrent).

## Interactions
YPEL5, a member of the Yippee-like gene family, is involved in various cellular interactions. In zebrafish, YPEL5 interacts with the Hnf4a gene, playing a crucial role in liver development and function. This interaction is mediated through the PPAR α signaling pathway, where PPAR α binds to a region upstream of the Hnf4a transcription start site, indicating that Hnf4a is a direct transcriptional target of PPAR α (Deng2023Ypel5). 

In the context of colorectal cancer, YPEL5 is epigenetically suppressed by the METTL3/YTHDF2 m6A axis. METTL3, an m6A methyltransferase, modifies the YPEL5 mRNA, leading to its suppression through an m6A-dependent mechanism involving YTHDF2. This interaction results in decreased YPEL5 expression, which is associated with increased cancer cell proliferation and migration (Zhou2021METTL3YTHDF2).

In yeast, YPEL5 has been shown to functionally complement the pro-apoptotic role of the Moh1 protein. This interaction suggests that YPEL5 may participate in apoptosis pathways, potentially through interactions with proteins involved in the apoptotic response to DNA damage (Lee2017ProApoptotic).
