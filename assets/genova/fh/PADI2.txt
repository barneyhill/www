# PADI2

## Overview
PADI2, or peptidyl arginine deiminase type 2, is a gene that encodes the enzyme peptidyl arginine deiminase 2, a member of the peptidylarginine deiminase family. This enzyme is primarily involved in the post-translational modification process known as citrullination, where it converts arginine residues into citrulline in proteins, thereby influencing protein structure and function. PADI2 plays a significant role in various biological processes, including osteogenesis, myelination in the central nervous system, and transcriptional regulation through histone modification. It is implicated in several pathological conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases, due to its regulatory effects on protein interactions and gene expression (Alghamdi2019An; Zhu2023Role; Falcão2019PAD2Mediated).

## Structure
PADI2 is a member of the peptidylarginine deiminase family, characterized by a structure that includes two N-terminal immunoglobulin-like domains (IgG1 and IgG2) and a C-terminal catalytic domain with an α/β propeller fold (Alghamdi2019An; Mondal2019Protein). The primary structure of PADI2 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the polypeptide chain, with specific residues such as L162 playing a crucial role in protein-protein interactions and transcriptional regulation (VillanuevaCañas2022Evolutionary). 

The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, particularly in the N-terminal domains, which are involved in structural stabilization and substrate specificity (Alghamdi2019An). The tertiary structure is defined by the catalytic domain, essential for the enzyme's activity, which is highly conserved across PAD isozymes (Alghamdi2019An). 

PADI2 can form a head-to-tail homodimer, indicating a quaternary structure, with active sites on the same face of the dimer (Slade2015Protein; Mondal2019Protein). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, occur within intrinsically disordered regions, influencing the enzyme's functionality (Alghamdi2019An). PADI2 also has known splice variant isoforms that may affect its function and localization (Alghamdi2019An).

## Function
PADI2 (peptidyl arginine deiminase 2) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the citrullination process, where it converts arginine residues into citrulline in proteins. This post-translational modification significantly impacts protein structure and function, influencing various cellular processes. In bone biology, PADI2 is essential for osteogenesis by enhancing the stability of the RUNX2 transcription factor through citrullination. This stabilization prevents RUNX2 from undergoing ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation, which is vital for osteoblast differentiation and bone homeostasis (Kim2023Peptidylarginine).

PADI2 is also involved in the differentiation and function of oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system. It facilitates the transition from oligodendrocyte precursor cells to mature oligodendrocytes, contributing to efficient myelination. This process is crucial for proper neuronal communication and CNS function (Falcão2019PAD2Mediated). PADI2's activity is observed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it affects chromatin structure and gene expression through histone citrullination, thereby regulating transcription and promoting cellular differentiation (Falcão2019PAD2Mediated).

## Clinical Significance
The PADI2 gene is implicated in several diseases due to its role in protein citrullination. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), PADI2 is associated with increased susceptibility and disease severity. Specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PADI2, such as rs2235926 and rs2057094, are linked to early onset of RA and higher levels of anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs), which are crucial in RA pathogenesis (Chang2013PADI2; GuzmánGuzmán2021PADI2). PADI2 expression is elevated in RA synovial tissues, suggesting its involvement in inflammation and joint damage (Chang2013PADI2).

In cancer, PADI2 is overexpressed in various types, including breast, skin, and prostate cancers, where it influences tumor progression through transcription regulation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (Beato2020Peptidyl; Wang2016PADI2). In breast cancer, PADI2 affects lipid metabolism and cell invasion, contributing to tumorigenesis (Wang2016PADI2). Conversely, PADI2 is downregulated in colorectal cancer, where it inhibits cellular proliferation (Beato2020Peptidyl).

PADI2 also plays a role in neurodegenerative diseases by promoting the accumulation of citrullinated proteins, which can exacerbate disease progression (Zhu2023Role). Its involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and multiple sclerosis highlights its broader impact on autoimmune conditions (Zhu2023Role).

## Interactions
PADI2 interacts with the androgen receptor (AR) in prostate cancer, stabilizing the AR protein and facilitating its nuclear translocation, which is crucial for AR signaling. This interaction prevents AR from binding to ubiquitin proteins, protecting it from proteasome-mediated degradation. PADI2 overexpression enhances AR's recruitment to the promoters of AR target genes, such as PSA and TMPRSS2, while its inhibition reduces this recruitment (Wang2017PADI2Mediated).

PADI2 also interacts with the P-TEFb complex, which includes cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) and Cyclin T1 (CCNT1). This interaction is crucial for transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II (RNAP2), as PADI2-mediated citrullination of arginine 1810 in the RNAP2 carboxyl-terminal domain facilitates the transcription of genes necessary for cell cycle progression and proliferation (Beato2020Peptidyl; VillanuevaCañas2022Evolutionary).

The interaction of PADI2 with histone H3, specifically citrullination at residue R26, is associated with transcriptional activation of AR target genes, highlighting its role in chromatin modification and transcription regulation (Wang2017PADI2Mediated). These interactions underscore PADI2's involvement in transcriptional regulation and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer.
