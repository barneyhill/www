# C5orf15

## Overview
C5orf15 is a gene located on chromosome 5 in humans, encoding the protein known as chromosome 5 open reading frame 15. This protein is categorized as an uncharacterized protein, as its specific biological functions and interactions remain largely undefined. Despite the limited understanding of its role, C5orf15 has been implicated in various cellular processes through its potential involvement in regulatory pathways. Research into the gene and its encoded protein is ongoing, with studies aiming to elucidate its function and significance in human health and disease. The gene's expression patterns and potential interactions with other proteins suggest a role in cellular homeostasis, although further investigation is required to confirm these hypotheses (Qiu2020aarFDC).
