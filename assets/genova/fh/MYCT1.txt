# MYCT1

## Overview
MYCT1 is a gene that encodes the MYC target 1 protein, which is a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes, including vesicle trafficking, endosomal processes, and cell signaling. The MYCT1 protein is characterized by its two transmembrane domains, which are crucial for its subcellular localization and function, particularly in membrane-associated trafficking vesicles (Wu2015Transmembrane). MYCT1 plays a significant role in maintaining the stemness of human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) by regulating endocytosis and cell surface receptor signaling (AguadéGorgorió2024MYCT1). It interacts with several proteins, including CKAP4 and MAX, influencing cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, and transcription regulation (Fu2023MYCT1; Wu2015Transmembrane). Clinically, MYCT1 has been implicated as a tumor suppressor in various cancers, with its expression levels affecting tumor progression and patient prognosis (Xie2023Low; Liang2024MYCT1).

## Structure
The MYCT1 protein is evolutionarily conserved across species from zebrafish to humans, with the exception of fruit flies, which lack MYCT1 homologues. In humans and chimpanzees, MYCT1 features an additional 48 amino acids at the N-terminus (Wu2015Transmembrane). The protein contains two transmembrane (TM) domains located at amino acids 26-48 and 68-90, which are crucial for its subcellular localization and function. These domains facilitate the granular distribution of MYCT1 in the cytoplasm, particularly in membrane-associated trafficking vesicles (Wu2015Transmembrane). The presence of a putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) at amino acids 91-114 has been identified, although it is not essential for the protein's vesicle-associated localization (Wu2015Transmembrane).

MYCT1 interacts with CKAP4, a protein involved in cellular processes such as proliferation and migration. This interaction is significant for MYCT1's function and is affected by mutations within the TM domain, such as the A88D mutation, which alters MYCT1's localization and weakens its interaction with CKAP4 (Wu2015Transmembrane). The TM domain is essential for MYCT1's role in reducing cell viability under growth factor deprivation and promoting cell migration (Wu2015Transmembrane).

## Function
The MYCT1 gene plays a crucial role in regulating environmental sensing and maintaining the stemness of human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). It is primarily localized in endosomes within HSCs, acting as an endosomal adaptor protein. MYCT1 is involved in vesicle trafficking, endosomal processes, cell surface receptor signaling, and cell adhesion, with its regulation of endocytosis being particularly significant. Knockdown of MYCT1 increases endocytosis, while overexpression decreases it, which is essential for preserving the stemness properties of HSCs (AguadéGorgorió2024MYCT1).

MYCT1 expression is associated with low endocytosis levels, which correlates with the maintenance of stemness programs, including the expression of ETS factors and reduced mitochondrial activity (AguadéGorgorió2024MYCT1). The gene also influences the expression of genes related to mitochondrial function and oxidative phosphorylation, impacting the mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species in HSCs (AguadéGorgorió2024MYCT1).

MYCT1 is essential for maintaining balanced signaling responses, crucial for cell proliferation and survival. It regulates the strength and duration of cell signaling in response to environmental cues, thereby maintaining proper cellular function (AguadéGorgorió2024MYCT1). The gene's expression is enriched in undifferentiated HSCs, indicating its importance in controlling endocytosis to maintain stemness (AguadéGorgorió2024MYCT1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MYCT1 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), MYCT1 is identified as a tumor suppressor gene, with reduced expression linked to the disease's progression. Overexpression of MYCT1 in DLBCL cell lines has been shown to reduce cell proliferation and induce cell cycle arrest, suggesting its role in maintaining chromosomal stability and inhibiting tumor growth (Liang2024MYCT1).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), MYCT1 expression is significantly lower in patients compared to healthy individuals, potentially due to promoter hypermethylation. Overexpression of MYCT1 in AML cell lines inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis, indicating its tumor suppressor function in this context (Fu2018Overexpression).

MYCT1 is also downregulated in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), where promoter hypermethylation is associated with reduced gene expression. This downregulation may contribute to increased tumor cell proliferation and invasiveness (Yang2012Promoter).

In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), low MYCT1 expression correlates with advanced tumor stage and poor prognosis. Overexpression of MYCT1 in OSCC cells decreases proliferation and invasion, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Xie2023Low).

## Interactions
MYCT1 interacts with several proteins and is involved in various cellular processes. It forms a complex with the MAX protein, which is crucial for its role in regulating transcription. In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), MYCT1 binds to MAX to repress the transcription of RUNX1, a transcription factor involved in cell proliferation and hematopoiesis (Fu2023MYCT1). This interaction is significant as it influences the expression of RUNX1, contributing to the regulation of cell cycle and proliferation in lymphoma cells.

In laryngeal cancer cells, MYCT1 also interacts with MAX, affecting the miR-181a/NPM1 pathway. This interaction is suggested to repress apoptosis, with MYCT1 acting as a co-transcription factor with MAX to regulate miR-181a expression, which in turn influences NPM1 levels (Wang2019MYCT1).

MYCT1 is also involved in vesicle trafficking and receptor signaling in human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). It localizes in endosomes and interacts with proteins such as clathrin, RAB5, RAB7, and RAB11, indicating its role in endosomal processes and environmental sensing (AguadéGorgorió2024MYCT1). These interactions highlight MYCT1's multifaceted role in cellular regulation and its potential impact on cancer and stem cell biology.
