# COPS9

## Overview
COPS9 is a gene that encodes the protein COP9 signalosome subunit 9, which is a component of the COP9 signalosome (CSN) complex. This complex is integral to the regulation of protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, functioning primarily as a deneddylase. The protein COP9 signalosome subunit 9 plays a critical role in removing NEDD8 from neddylated cullins within cullin-RING-E3 ligases (CRLs), thereby modulating their activity and influencing protein turnover (Liu2024COP9). The CSN complex, including COPS9, shares structural and functional similarities with the 19S lid complex of the 26S proteasome, and is involved in deneddylation and phosphorylation processes that regulate intracellular signaling pathways (Liu2024COP9). COPS9 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it impacts various cellular processes such as cell cycle progression, DNA repair, and signal transduction, and interacts with key proteins like TP53 and CUL1/2/3/4 (Liu2024COP9). Through these interactions, COPS9 contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis and may have implications in tumor development (Liu2024COP9).

## Function
COPS9, a subunit of the COP9 signalosome complex, is involved in the regulation of protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. It functions as a deneddylase, removing NEDD8 from neddylated cullin in cullin-RING-E3 ligases (CRLs), which is crucial for modulating the activity of these ligases and affecting protein turnover (Liu2024COP9). The COP9 signalosome, including COPS9, shares structural and functional similarities with the 19S lid complex of the 26S proteasome, playing a role in deneddylation and phosphorylation, which regulates intracellular signal transduction pathways (Liu2024COP9).

COPS9 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing various cellular processes such as cell cycle progression, DNA repair, and signal transduction (Liu2024COP9). It interacts with proteins like TP53 and CUL1/2/3/4, indicating its involvement in significant cellular pathways, including the cell cycle and Wnt signaling (Liu2024COP9). The COP9 signalosome, with COPS9 as a component, serves as a molecular platform for proteolysis and signal transduction, impacting cellular homeostasis and potentially influencing tumor development (Liu2024COP9).

## Interactions
COPS9, a subunit of the COP9 signalosome (CSN) complex, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. The CSN complex, which includes COPS9, interacts with cullin-RING ligases (CRLs), playing a significant role in the regulation of protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This interaction involves the modulation of neddylated cullins, as Nedd8 was identified as a putative interactor, suggesting that the CSN complex, including COPS9, may regulate the neddylation cycle of cullins (Fang2012Mapping).

The CSN complex also interacts with subunits of the 26 S proteasome and the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complexes, indicating a role in modulating eIF3 function through proteasome degradation. This suggests that COPS9, as part of the CSN complex, may act as an alternative lid or platform for ubiquitin ligases at the 26 S proteasome (Fang2012Mapping).

Additionally, COPS9 is implicated in interactions with various proteins involved in cell cycle regulation and signal transduction pathways. These interactions include known CSN interactors such as cullins and CRL adaptor proteins, as well as other proteins like CDK2 and ASNA1, which have been confirmed to specifically interact with CSN subunits (Fang2012Mapping).
