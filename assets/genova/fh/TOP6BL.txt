# TOP6BL

## Overview
The TOP6BL gene encodes a protein that is integral to the initiation of meiotic double-strand breaks (DSBs), a critical process for meiotic recombination and chromosome segregation. The protein, often referred to as a topoisomerase VI B-like subunit, is characterized by its GHKL domain, which is essential for ATP binding and hydrolysis, and its interaction with other meiotic proteins such as SPO11b. This interaction facilitates the formation of a topoisomerase VI-like complex necessary for DSB formation during meiosis (Brinkmeier2022Evolution; Jiao2020A). Mutations in the TOP6BL gene can lead to infertility due to the disruption of this complex, underscoring the gene's crucial role in reproductive biology (Jiao2020A). The protein's function and interactions highlight its importance in ensuring genetic diversity and proper gamete formation, making it a significant focus of research in the context of fertility and meiotic processes (Nore2021TOPOVIBLREC114; Jiao2020A).

## Structure
The TOP6BL protein is involved in initiating meiotic double-strand breaks and consists of 577 amino acids. Its structure includes several key domains: the GHKL (Gyrase, Hsp90, Histidine Kinase, MutL) domain, a linker region, the transducer domain, and the C-terminal domain (Jiao2020A). The GHKL domain is crucial for ATP binding and hydrolysis, a feature it shares with other proteins like DNA gyrase and heat-shock proteins (Brinkmeier2022Evolution). The transducer domain is essential for interaction with SPO11b, a protein necessary for meiotic DNA double-strand break formation (Jiao2020A).

Mutations in the TOP6BL gene can lead to truncated proteins lacking these critical domains, which disrupts its function in meiosis and causes infertility (Jiao2020A). The protein's interaction with SPO11b is vital for forming the topoisomerase VI-like complex, which is necessary for double-strand break formation during meiosis (Jiao2020A). The structural integrity of these domains is crucial for the protein's role in meiotic progression and fertility, as demonstrated by studies using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to create specific mutations in mice (Jiao2020A).

## Function
The TOP6BL gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the formation of programmed meiotic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which are essential for meiotic recombination and proper chromosome segregation during meiosis I. This process is crucial for the formation of haploid gametes in sexual reproduction (Jiao2020A). The TOP6BL protein functions as part of a topoisomerase VI-like complex, interacting with other proteins such as SPO11, MEI1, MEI4, REC114, and IHO1 to catalyze the formation of DSBs (Jiao2020A). 

In healthy human cells, the TOP6BL protein is active in the nucleus during meiosis, where it interacts with SPO11b via its C-terminus to induce DSBs, a critical step for successful homologous recombination and chromosome segregation (Jiao2020A). The absence of functional TOP6BL disrupts this process, leading to meiotic arrest and infertility due to the failure of programmed meiotic DSB formation (Jiao2020A). The gene's role in DSB formation highlights its importance in ensuring genetic diversity and proper meiotic progression, which are necessary for normal gamete formation and fertility (Jiao2020A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TOP6BL gene are associated with significant reproductive issues, primarily infertility. In both male and female mice, mutations such as a 7-bp deletion in TOP6BL lead to the production of a truncated protein that lacks essential domains, resulting in the absence of meiotic DNA double-strand break (DSB) formation. This disruption causes meiotic arrest before the pachytene stage in spermatocytes, leading to azoospermia and male infertility. In females, similar mutations result in premature ovarian insufficiency, characterized by a reduction in oocyte numbers and failure to complete meiosis I, ultimately causing infertility (Jiao2020A).

In humans, a recessive loss-of-function mutation in TOP6BL (p. E162*) was identified in a consanguineous family, causing azoospermia in males and unexplained primary infertility in females. This mutation leads to the absence of meiotic DSBs, causing meiotic arrest and infertility. The mutation's pathogenicity was confirmed in mouse models with similar mutations (Jiao2020A). Additionally, mutations in TOP6BL have been linked to conditions such as primary ovarian insufficiency and non-obstructive azoospermia, highlighting its critical role in meiotic recombination and fertility (Llano2023Synaptonemal). These findings underscore the importance of TOP6BL in programmed meiotic DSB formation and its potential as a target for diagnosing and treating infertility.

## Interactions
The TOP6BL gene encodes a meiosis-specific topoisomerase VI B-like subunit that plays a crucial role in the formation of meiotic double-strand breaks (DSBs). This protein interacts with SPO11b via its C-terminus to induce programmed meiotic DSBs. A mutation in TOP6BL, specifically a 1-bp duplication in exon 7 (c.483dupT), introduces a premature termination codon at amino acid 162, disrupting this interaction. The wild-type TOP6BL can interact with SPO11b, but the p.E162* variant cannot, as confirmed by a yeast two-hybrid assay. This disruption prevents the formation of the topoisomerase VI-like complex, which is necessary for catalyzing DSB formation during meiosis (Jiao2020A).

In addition to its interaction with SPO11b, TOPOVIBL, a protein related to TOP6BL, forms a stable complex with REC114. This interaction is mediated by specific domains in both proteins, with the N-terminal PH domain of REC114 required for binding to TOPOVIBL, while the C-terminus of TOPOVIBL is necessary for this interaction. The interaction was confirmed using yeast two-hybrid assays and Strep-tag pull-down assays (Nore2021TOPOVIBLREC114). These interactions are crucial for the regulation of meiotic DNA DSBs, highlighting the importance of TOP6BL in meiotic processes.
