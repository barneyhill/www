# MMP1

## Overview
Matrix metallopeptidase 1 (MMP1) is a gene that encodes for the enzyme matrix metallopeptidase 1, a member of the matrix metalloproteinase family. This enzyme is categorized as a protease, specifically involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix components, such as interstitial collagens types I, II, and III. MMP1 plays a critical role in physiological processes like tissue remodeling, wound healing, and angiogenesis by facilitating the degradation of collagen, which is a major structural protein in connective tissues (Iyer2006Crystal). The enzyme's activity is tightly regulated by various mechanisms, including interaction with tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) and binding to receptors such as low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) (Carreca2020TIMP3; Arai2020HighAffinity). Dysregulation of MMP1 expression and activity is implicated in pathological conditions, including cancer, arthritis, and fibrosis, where it contributes to disease progression through excessive extracellular matrix degradation (Iyer2006Crystal; Zhou2022MMP1).

## Structure
Matrix metallopeptidase 1 (MMP1) is a member of the matrix metalloproteinase family, characterized by a multi-domain structure. The primary structure of MMP1 includes a signal peptide, a propeptide, a catalytic domain with a zinc-binding motif, and a hemopexin-like C-terminal domain (Jozic2005Xray; Iyer2006Crystal). The secondary structure features alpha-helices and beta-sheets, with the catalytic domain containing a five-stranded, highly twisted β-sheet (Jozic2005Xray).

The tertiary structure of MMP1 is globular, with the catalytic domain and hemopexin (HPX) domain connected by a linker region. The HPX domain has a four-bladed propeller structure, each blade consisting of four antiparallel β-strands (Jozic2005Xray). This domain is crucial for binding and unwinding collagen, facilitating its cleavage by the catalytic domain (Jozic2005Xray).

MMP1 exhibits interdomain flexibility, allowing the catalytic and HPX domains to adopt various conformations, which is essential for its collagenolytic activity (Bertini2009Interdomain; Cerofolini2013Examination). This flexibility is supported by NMR and SAXS studies, which show that MMP1 can exist in both compact and extended states in solution (Bertini2009Interdomain; Cerofolini2013Examination).

Post-translational modifications of MMP1 include glycosylation and phosphorylation, which may influence its activity and interactions. MMP1 also has several splice variant isoforms, potentially differing in their functional properties.

## Function
Matrix metallopeptidase 1 (MMP1) is a crucial enzyme involved in the degradation of interstitial collagen types I, II, and III, which are essential structural components of connective tissues such as cartilage, bone, skin, tendons, and ligaments (Iyer2006Crystal). MMP1 plays a pivotal role in the remodeling and degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) during vital physiological processes, including angiogenesis, wound healing, and development (Iyer2006Crystal). 

In healthy human cells, MMP1 is particularly important for keratinocyte migration on type I collagen matrices, a process essential for wound healing and tissue repair. The enzyme cleaves fibrillar type I collagen, converting it into gelatin, which facilitates keratinocyte movement (Pilcher1997The). This activity is regulated by integrin interactions, particularly involving the a2b1 integrin subunit, which induces MMP1 expression upon contact with native type I collagen (Pilcher1997The). 

MMP1's proteolytic activity resides in its catalytic domain, but it requires the hemopexin domain to cleave the triple-helical collagen (Iyer2006Crystal). The enzyme's activity is tightly regulated by transcriptional control, proteolytic processing, and inhibition by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) (Iyer2006Crystal). Unbalanced ECM breakdown by MMP1 is associated with diseases such as arthritis, cancer, and fibrosis (Iyer2006Crystal).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and genetic mutations of the MMP1 gene have significant clinical implications across various diseases, particularly in cancer. MMP1 is frequently overexpressed in numerous tumor types, contributing to tumor invasion and metastasis by degrading the extracellular matrix. High MMP1 expression is associated with poor overall survival in several cancers, including lung, pancreatic, and uveal melanoma, although it correlates with better outcomes in ovarian cancer (Mao2023A; Wang2021MMP1). In hepatocellular carcinoma, elevated MMP1 levels are linked to advanced tumor stages and poor prognosis, although no significant difference in survival was observed between patients with and without MMP1 alterations (Dai2022Comprehensive).

Genetic polymorphisms in MMP1, such as the rs1799750 polymorphism, have been associated with increased cancer risk, particularly in early-onset lung cancer and breast cancer (Balkhi2020Matrix; Sauter2008Matrix). These polymorphisms can lead to higher transcriptional activity and protein expression, facilitating cancer progression. In papillary thyroid cancer, MMP1 expression is linked to tumor dedifferentiation and poor prognosis, suggesting its role as a potential therapeutic target (Zhou2022MMP1). Overall, MMP1 serves as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target in various cancers due to its role in tumor progression and metastasis.

## Interactions
Matrix metallopeptidase 1 (MMP1) interacts with several proteins, notably forming complexes with tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). MMP1 binds to the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) with high affinity, particularly when in complex with TIMP-1. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of extracellular matrix homeostasis, as LRP1 controls the levels of MMP1 and MMP9 (Arai2020HighAffinity). The binding affinity of the MMP1/TIMP-1 complex to LRP1 is significantly higher than that of MMP1 or TIMP-1 alone, indicating a preference for the protease:inhibitor complex (Arai2020HighAffinity).

TIMP-3 also enhances the binding of MMP1 to LRP1, facilitating its endocytosis. This interaction is mediated by the hemopexin domain of MMP1, which is necessary for binding to LRP1, as the catalytic domain alone does not bind effectively (Carreca2020TIMP3). TIMP-3 binds to LRP1 with high affinity and increases the affinity of MMP1 for LRP1, promoting its removal from the extracellular environment (Carreca2020TIMP3).

MMP1 also interacts with triple-helical peptides (THP) through its catalytic and hemopexin domains. These interactions are crucial for its enzymatic activity, particularly in the context of collagenolysis (Singh2016Importance).
