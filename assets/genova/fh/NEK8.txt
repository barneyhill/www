# NEK8

## Overview
The NEK8 gene encodes the NIMA-related kinase 8, a serine/threonine protein kinase that plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, DNA damage response, and ciliogenesis. As a member of the NIMA-related kinase family, NEK8 is characterized by its N-terminal catalytic domain, which is crucial for its kinase activity, and a central RCC1-like domain that facilitates protein-protein interactions. The protein localizes to centrosomes and primary cilia, where it is involved in regulating ciliary dynamics and cell cycle progression. NEK8's involvement in the Hippo signaling pathway and its interactions with key proteins in the DNA damage response underscore its importance in maintaining genomic stability and normal cellular function. Mutations in NEK8 are linked to several diseases, including nephronophthisis and syndromic renal cystic dysplasia, highlighting its clinical significance (Holland2002Purification; Abeyta2017NEK8; Zalli2011The).

## Structure
The NEK8 protein is a serine/threonine kinase with a complex molecular structure. It features an N-terminal catalytic domain typical of the NIMA-related kinase family, which is involved in cell cycle regulation and ciliogenesis (Holland2002Purification; Zalli2011The). The protein also contains a central domain homologous to RCC1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, although it lacks some residues necessary for exchange factor activity (Holland2002Purification). This RCC1-like domain forms a seven-bladed beta-propeller structure, crucial for protein-protein interactions and proper localization to centrosomes and cilia (Zalli2011The; McCooke2012A).

NEK8's tertiary structure includes a C-terminal coiled-coil domain, which is important for dimerization and protein-protein interactions (Holland2002Purification). The protein undergoes autophosphorylation, particularly at Thr-210, which is essential for its activation and may lead to dimerization (Holland2002Purification). NEK8 is also subject to proteasomal degradation during ciliogenesis, a process that regulates its activity and localization (Zalli2011The). The protein's structure and modifications are critical for its function in cellular processes and its role in diseases such as nephronophthisis (Zalli2011The).

## Function
The NEK8 gene encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase that plays a critical role in several cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, DNA damage response, and ciliogenesis. In healthy human cells, NEK8 is involved in maintaining the integrity and function of cilia, which are essential for detecting and orchestrating cellular responses to extracellular stimuli. This function is crucial for early embryonic development and tissue maintenance (Frank2013Mutations).

NEK8 localizes to centrosomes and the proximal segment of primary cilia, where it is involved in regulating ciliary dynamics and cell cycle progression. Its kinase activity and the C-terminal RCC1 domain are essential for its proper localization and function (Zalli2011The). NEK8 is also implicated in the Hippo signaling pathway, where it regulates processes such as epithelial and planar cell polarity, which are vital for normal cellular function and development (Frank2013Mutations).

In the context of DNA damage response, NEK8 is crucial for the formation of RAD51 foci and replication fork stability, playing a significant role in homologous recombination repair. NEK8-deficient cells exhibit increased chromosomal aberrations and sensitivity to replication stress, highlighting its importance in maintaining genomic stability (Abeyta2017NEK8).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NEK8 gene are associated with several diseases, primarily affecting the kidneys and other organs. In humans, NEK8 mutations are linked to nephronophthisis, a childhood autosomal recessive kidney disease characterized by cystic kidney degeneration (Abeyta2017NEK8; Zalli2011The). These mutations can also lead to severe syndromic renal cystic dysplasia through dysregulation of the YAP signaling pathway, affecting multiple systems including the kidneys, liver, heart, and skeletal system (Grampa2016Novel). 

In animal models, NEK8 mutations are associated with juvenile cystic kidney disease in mice and Lewis polycystic kidney disease in rats, both of which exhibit defects in ciliary localization and function (Abeyta2017NEK8; McCooke2012A). NEK8 is also implicated in cancer development, with mutations identified as potential driver mutations in pancreatic cancer and overexpression observed in breast cancer (Abeyta2017NEK8; Zalli2011The). 

The gene's role in the ATR-mediated replication stress response and its interaction with checkpoint kinases suggest that NEK8 mutations can lead to defects in DNA repair, contributing to increased apoptosis and potentially cancer progression (Abeyta2017NEK8).

## Interactions
NEK8 interacts with several key proteins involved in the DNA damage response and replication stress management. It forms interactions with ATR, ATRIP, and CHK1, which are crucial components of the ATR-CHK1 signaling pathway. These interactions are enhanced under replication stress conditions, such as treatment with aphidicolin, indicating that NEK8 is involved in managing replication stress and maintaining replication fork stability (Choi2013NEK8). NEK8 also interacts with cyclin A and CDK2, suggesting a role in regulating cyclin-dependent kinase activity to suppress double-strand breaks and promote genome stability (Choi2013NEK8).

NEK8's interaction with the nuclease MRE11 suggests a role in replication fork protection, as NEK8-deficient cells show increased chromosomal aberrations and decreased RAD51 foci formation, which are critical for homologous recombination (Abeyta2017NEK8). NEK8 also interacts with the polycystin proteins PC-1 and PC-2, which are involved in signaling pathways related to cystic kidney disease (Zalli2011The). These interactions highlight NEK8's multifaceted role in cellular processes, including DNA damage response, replication stress management, and ciliogenesis.
