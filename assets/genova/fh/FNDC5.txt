# FNDC5

## Overview
The FNDC5 gene encodes a type I transmembrane protein known as fibronectin type III domain containing 5, which is involved in various physiological processes. This protein undergoes cleavage to release irisin, a myokine that plays a significant role in energy metabolism, particularly in the browning of white adipose tissue and enhancing thermogenesis (Rabiee2020New; Boström2012A). FNDC5 is primarily expressed in skeletal muscle and is upregulated during physical exercise, linking it to improved glucose metabolism and neuroprotection through increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels (Wrann2013Exercise; Maak2021Progress). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as amyloid precursor protein (APP) and AKR1B10, suggest its involvement in neurodegenerative diseases and cancer (Noda2018Fibronectin; Chen2023FNDC5). Alterations in FNDC5 expression and function have been associated with metabolic disorders, including diabetes and hepatic steatosis, highlighting its clinical significance (Zhang2020Fibronectin; Metwally2019A).

## Structure
The FNDC5 gene encodes a protein that is synthesized as a type I transmembrane protein with a molecular weight of approximately 25 kDa. The protein structure includes an N-terminal sequence, an irisin domain, a short transmembrane region, and a cytosolic C-terminal domain (Daudon2022Irisin). FNDC5 is N-glycosylated at asparagine residues 36 and 81, which is crucial for its structural stability and biological function (Zhang2020A). This glycosylation affects the protein's molecular weight, half-life, and bioactivity, with the removal of these sites significantly decreasing its half-life and affecting its distribution and secretion (Zhang2020A).

The FNDC5 protein can be cleaved to release irisin, a circulating bioactive molecule consisting of 112 amino acids with a mass of 12.6 kDa. Irisin contains an N-terminal FNIII-like domain (Daudon2022Irisin). The cleavage of FNDC5 into irisin is hypothesized to be mediated by the ADAM family of proteases, specifically ADAM10 (Zhang2020A). The protein is involved in various physiological processes, including autophagy, oxidative stress response, and bone metabolism (Zhang2020A). The exact molecular structure, including primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, is not detailed in the available context.

## Function
The FNDC5 gene encodes a protein that is cleaved to produce irisin, a myokine involved in various physiological processes. Irisin is primarily produced by skeletal muscle and is released into circulation during exercise. It plays a significant role in the browning of white adipose tissue, promoting the expression of thermogenic genes such as UCP1, which enhances energy expenditure and thermogenesis (Rabiee2020New; Boström2012A). This process is mediated through the transcription factor PPARα and involves the MAPK signaling pathways, particularly the p38 and ERK pathways (Rabiee2020New; Boström2012A).

Irisin also influences glucose metabolism and homeostasis by enhancing glucose uptake in muscle cells via the p38 MAPK pathway, potentially ameliorating insulin resistance (Rabiee2020New). In the brain, FNDC5 expression is associated with increased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is crucial for neurogenesis, learning, and memory. This suggests a role in cognitive function and neuroprotection, particularly in response to exercise (Wrann2013Exercise; Maak2021Progress).

Overall, FNDC5/irisin is a multifunctional protein that coordinates metabolic processes across various tissues, highlighting its importance in maintaining physiological homeostasis (Rabiee2020New).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FNDC5 gene, which encodes the protein irisin, have been linked to various metabolic and disease conditions. In diabetes mellitus, FNDC5 is implicated in glucose regulation, influencing insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus. Studies indicate that irisin levels are generally lower in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients, suggesting a protective role against T2DM, although some studies report increased levels due to irisin resistance or compensatory mechanisms. In type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), irisin levels are higher, possibly compensating for reduced insulin levels (Zhang2020Fibronectin).

The rs3480 polymorphism in FNDC5 is associated with hepatic steatosis, affecting mRNA stability and expression. The G allele of this variant results in lower mRNA stability, increasing the risk of hepatic steatosis independently of other known risk variants (Metwally2019A). FNDC5 expression is also linked to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where high irisin levels in tumor stroma correlate with shorter survival times. FNDC5 expression is regulated by PGC-1α and ERRα, and its interaction with these proteins may influence cancer progression (Nowińska2022Association).

## Interactions
FNDC5, a transmembrane protein, interacts with several proteins, notably the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and AKR1B10. In the context of Alzheimer's disease, FNDC5 binds to the C99 fragment of APP, but not to C83, suggesting a specific interaction that affects the β-cleavage of APP. This interaction decreases the production of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, which are implicated in Alzheimer's pathology (Noda2018Fibronectin). FNDC5's interaction with APP is thought to suppress β-secretase activity, promoting cleavage by α-secretase and reducing Aβ production (Noda2018Fibronectin).

In adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) cells, FNDC5 interacts with AKR1B10, a member of the aldo-keto reductase family. This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Overexpression of FNDC5 in ACC cells suppresses proliferation, migration, and invasion, while promoting apoptosis, effects that are mediated through the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway. The knockdown of AKR1B10 counteracts these effects, indicating a regulatory interaction between FNDC5 and AKR1B10 (Chen2023FNDC5).

FNDC5 is also cleaved to form irisin, which interacts with integrin receptors, particularly integrin αVβ5, influencing cell signaling and adhesion (Maak2021Progress).
