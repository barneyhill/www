# ZNF780A

## Overview
ZNF780A is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 780A, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are small protein structural motifs that can coordinate one or more zinc ions to help stabilize their folds. Zinc finger proteins are typically involved in DNA binding and play crucial roles in transcriptional regulation, cellular development, and differentiation. The specific functions of zinc finger protein 780A, as encoded by ZNF780A, remain to be fully elucidated, but it is believed to participate in gene expression regulation through its interaction with DNA and possibly other proteins. Understanding the precise role of ZNF780A and its encoded protein could provide insights into various biological processes and potential implications in human health and disease.
