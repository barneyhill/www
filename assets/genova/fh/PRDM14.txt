# PRDM14

## Overview
PRDM14 is a gene that encodes the PR/SET domain 14 protein, which is a member of the PR domain-containing family of proteins. This protein is characterized by the presence of a PR domain and multiple zinc finger motifs, which are essential for its role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation (Fan2015Identification; Draime2018PRDM14). Although the PR domain is similar to SET domains involved in histone methylation, PRDM14 itself does not exhibit methyltransferase activity (Fan2015Identification). The protein is primarily involved in maintaining pluripotency and regulating gene expression in human embryonic stem cells and primordial germ cell-like cells (Sybirna2020A). PRDM14 also plays a significant role in epigenetic reprogramming and is implicated in various cancers, where its aberrant expression is associated with poor prognosis and cancer stemness (Tracey2019Off; IMAI2022Therapeutic). Through its interactions with other proteins, such as the PRC2 complex and heat shock proteins, PRDM14 influences both normal cellular processes and oncogenic pathways (Yamamoto2020The; Moriya2017PRDM14).

## Structure
PRDM14 is a protein characterized by a PR domain and multiple zinc finger motifs. The primary structure of PRDM14 includes a PR domain, which shares similarities with SET domains known for their role in histone methylation, although PRDM14 itself lacks demonstrated methyltransferase activity (Fan2015Identification; Draime2018PRDM14). The protein also contains several zinc finger domains, which are crucial for DNA binding and sequence-specific recruitment to genomic targets (Okashita2014PRDM14; Fan2015Identification).

The secondary structure of PRDM14 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, particularly within the SET domain, which is composed of nine beta-strands arranged in three antiparallel beta-sheets and a short helix (Nady2015ETO). The tertiary structure is stabilized by the zinc finger domains, facilitating DNA binding and interaction with other proteins (Okashita2014PRDM14).

In terms of quaternary structure, PRDM14 forms complexes with other proteins, such as Mtgr1, which is essential for its function in stem cell maintenance and germ cell formation (Nady2015ETO). The interaction with Mtgr1 involves the pre-SET and SET regions of PRDM14, highlighting the importance of these domains in protein-protein interactions (Nady2015ETO).

## Function
PRDM14 is a critical regulator in human primordial germ cell-like cells (hPGCLCs) and human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). It functions as a core pluripotency factor, essential for the induction and specification of hPGCLCs. PRDM14 regulates gene expression by binding to promoters, with chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) identifying thousands of PRDM14 binding sites, predominantly within 1 kb of transcription start sites. Approximately 30% of these sites span annotated promoters, indicating its role in transcriptional regulation (Sybirna2020A).

PRDM14 collaborates with other transcription factors such as BLIMP1 and TFAP2C, forming a network that regulates germ cell and pluripotency genes while repressing somatic differentiation markers. This network is crucial for maintaining the transcriptome integrity in hPGCLCs and hESCs (Sybirna2020A). PRDM14 also plays a role in epigenetic reprogramming, although the precise mechanisms in human primordial germ cells are not fully understood (Sybirna2020A).

In the context of hPGCLC specification, PRDM14 is involved in the repression of SOX2, which is necessary for initiating hPGCLC fate. Its expression is influenced by SOX2 and SOX17, highlighting its integration into the broader regulatory network governing germ cell fate (Sybirna2020A).

## Clinical Significance
PRDM14 is implicated in various cancers due to its role in maintaining pluripotency and its aberrant expression in tumorigenic processes. Overexpression of PRDM14 is linked to poor prognosis in several cancers, including breast, pancreatic, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Tracey2019Off; IMAI2022Therapeutic). In breast cancer, PRDM14 is often amplified, correlating with high mitotic index and metastasis, and its knockdown can induce apoptosis and increase drug sensitivity (Casamassimi2020Multifaceted). In colorectal cancer, PRDM14 expression is associated with lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis, particularly in patients with KRAS mutations (Igarashi2019PRDM14).

PRDM14 also plays a role in cancer stemness, contributing to tumor initiation, progression, and therapeutic resistance. It interacts with proteins like HSP90 and GRP78, which are involved in cancer stemness regulation, and targeting these interactions could be beneficial for cancer treatment (Moriya2017PRDM14). In HPV-positive cancers, PRDM14's methylation-mediated silencing contributes to apoptosis evasion, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Snellenberg2014Methylationmediated). The gene's involvement in epigenetic reprogramming and genomic instability further underscores its significance in cancer biology (Tracey2019Off).

## Interactions
PRDM14 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation and cellular processes. It interacts with the HOXA1 transcription factor, decreasing its stability and activity. This interaction involves the PR and ZF domains of PRDM14 and the homeodomain and 11-His motif of HOXA1, primarily occurring in the nucleus (Draime2018PRDM14). PRDM14 also recruits the PRC2 complex to target genes through interactions with SUZ12 and CtBP2. This recruitment is crucial for PRDM14-mediated transcriptional repression, as evidenced by impaired repression in Suz12 knockout embryonic stem cells (Yamamoto2020The).

In the context of cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), PRDM14 interacts with heat shock proteins HSP90α and GRP78. These interactions require the C-terminal region of PRDM14, which includes zinc finger motifs. Targeting these interactions with specific inhibitors has shown potential in reducing cancer cell proliferation and stem-like properties (Moriya2017PRDM14). These findings highlight the diverse roles of PRDM14 in both maintaining pluripotency and influencing cancer phenotypes through its interactions with various proteins.
