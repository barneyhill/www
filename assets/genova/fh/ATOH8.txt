# ATOH8

## Overview
ATOH8 is a gene that encodes the atonal bHLH transcription factor 8, a member of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors. This protein is characterized by its conserved bHLH domain, which is essential for DNA binding and dimerization, allowing it to regulate gene expression during various developmental processes (Chen2011Diversification). ATOH8 is involved in the differentiation of neural precursors, pancreatic precursor cells, and muscle development, among other roles (Chen2015A). The protein's interactions with other molecules, such as hypoxia-inducible factors and calcineurin subunits, further modulate its function and localization within the cell (Morikawa2019The; Chen2015A). Clinically, ATOH8 has been implicated in several cancers, where its expression levels can influence tumor progression and patient prognosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Divvela2022Atoh8; Ye2017High).

## Structure
The ATOH8 protein is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor characterized by a highly conserved bHLH domain, which is crucial for its function in DNA binding and dimerization (Chen2011Diversification). The primary structure of human ATOH8 includes a proline-rich region (PRR) from residues 69 to 187 and a serine-rich region (SRR) from residues 190 to 209. These regions are followed by a predicted nuclear localization signal (NLS) at residues 210 to 213. The bHLH domain spans from Arg231 to Leu285, with the basic region from residues 231 to 242 and the helix-loop-helix domain from 243 to 285. Another predicted NLS is located at the C-terminus at residues 317 to 320 (Chen2015A).

The protein's structure varies among species, with mammals possessing a serine-rich region absent in non-mammalian vertebrates like frogs and zebrafish (Chen2011Diversification). ATOH8 also interacts with PPP3CB, a subunit of calcineurin, which influences its nuclear localization and transcriptional activity (Chen2015A). The presence of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) such as the proline-rich and serine-rich regions suggests evolutionary lability, potentially fine-tuning the transcription factor's functions (Chen2011Diversification).

## Function
The ATOH8 gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor that plays a significant role in various developmental processes in healthy human cells. ATOH8 is involved in the differentiation of neural precursors, pancreatic precursor cells, and podocytes, as well as in the development of the retina and muscles (Chen2015A). It acts as a Neurogenin repressor in pancreatic cells, potentially through binding to the E47 protein, inhibiting E47/E47 or E47/Neurogenin3 dimer activity (Chen2015A).

In muscle development, ATOH8 is expressed in the myotomal compartment during embryogenesis and is involved in skeletal myogenesis, particularly in the hypaxial myotome of the trunk. It regulates the transition from committed to differentiated states in myogenesis, influencing the expression of myogenic differentiation genes like Myf5 and Myogenin (BalakrishnanRenuka2013ATOH8).

ATOH8 also plays a role in chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation in endochondral bones, acting as a positive regulator of chondrocyte proliferation and influencing the onset of hypertrophic differentiation (Schroeder2019Atoh8). Its function in these processes is crucial for proper skeletal development and growth (Schroeder2019Atoh8).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ATOH8 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In colorectal cancer (CRC), high ATOH8 expression is associated with poor prognosis and increased tumor progression. Knockdown of ATOH8 in CRC cell lines results in decreased proliferation, increased apoptosis, and enhanced sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (Ye2017High). ATOH8 also plays a role in the survival of circulating colorectal cancer cells by promoting glycolysis, which is crucial for metastasis (Huang2020Shear).

In pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), ATOH8 interacts with hypoxia-inducible factor 2α (HIF-2α), decreasing its abundance and thereby modulating hypoxia-induced responses. This interaction is significant in protecting against PAH development, as ATOH8 deficiency leads to elevated pulmonary arterial pressure and a PAH-like phenotype in mice (Morikawa2019The).

In breast cancer, a novel isoform of ATOH8, known as Atoh8-V1, is identified as a negative prognostic marker, promoting metastasis (Divvela2022Atoh8). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ATOH8 in cancer prognosis and potential therapeutic strategies.

## Interactions
ATOH8, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function and cellular localization. ATOH8 physically interacts with hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1α and HIF-2α, but not with HIF-1β, in HEK293T cells. This interaction leads to a decrease in the abundance of HIF-1α and HIF-2α proteins, suggesting that ATOH8 may promote their degradation through the proteasome pathway, as indicated by the rescue of HIF-2α destabilization by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Morikawa2019The). The bHLH domain of ATOH8 is necessary and sufficient for this degradation process (Morikawa2019The).

ATOH8 also interacts specifically with the PPP3CB isoform of calcineurin, a catalytic subunit involved in calcium signaling. This interaction, confirmed through various assays, suggests that PPP3CB may dephosphorylate ATOH8, facilitating its nuclear localization. This mechanism is similar to the nuclear translocation of NFAT proteins (Chen2015A). In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells, PPP3CB promotes the nuclear translocation of ATOH8, where ATOH8 acts as a transcription factor inhibiting the expression of Sp1 by binding to its promoter region (Hang2024PPP3CB).
