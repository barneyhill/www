# IL12RB2

## Overview
The IL12RB2 gene encodes the interleukin 12 receptor subunit beta 2, a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the immune system by forming part of the interleukin-12 (IL-12) receptor complex. This receptor is integral to the IL-12 signaling pathway, which is crucial for the differentiation and function of T helper 1 (Th1) cells and natural killer (NK) cells. The IL12RB2 protein, characterized by fibronectin type III domains, interacts with the IL12RB1 subunit to form a high-affinity receptor for IL-12, facilitating the activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, particularly STAT4, which is essential for the production of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and the immune response against intracellular pathogens (Floss2020IL12; MartínezBarricarte2018Human). Variations in the IL12RB2 gene have been associated with several autoimmune and infectious diseases, underscoring its clinical significance in modulating immune responses (Hirschfield2009Primary; Ohyama2005Polymorphism).

## Structure
The IL12RB2 gene encodes the interleukin 12 receptor subunit beta 2, which is a critical component of the IL-12 receptor complex. This protein is characterized by the presence of fibronectin type III (FNIII) domains, which are integral to its function as a cytokine receptor (Floss2020IL12). These domains form the cytokine-binding homology region (CHR), essential for cytokine binding and signal transduction (Floss2020IL12).

The IL-12Rβ2 subunit is involved in forming a heterodimeric receptor complex with IL-12Rβ1, facilitating IL-12 signaling. The cytoplasmic region of IL-12Rβ2 contains multiple tyrosine residues, which are crucial for signaling, particularly through the Jak/STAT pathway (Floss2020IL12). In humans, specific tyrosine residues such as Y678, Y767, and Y800 are conserved, with Y800 being pivotal for STAT4 activation and serving as a docking site for SOCS3, which inhibits IL-12-induced STAT4 activation (Floss2020IL12).

The IL-12Rβ2 protein is also involved in forming homodimers, which have been proposed as receptors for IL-35, demonstrating its versatility in cytokine signaling (Floss2020IL12). The receptor lacks intrinsic kinase activity, relying on associated tyrosine kinases for signal transduction (Floss2020IL12).

## Function
IL12RB2 encodes the interleukin 12 receptor subunit beta 2, which is a critical component of the IL-12 receptor complex. This receptor is essential for IL-12-dependent signaling, which plays a pivotal role in the immune response. In healthy human cells, IL12RB2 is involved in the activation of STAT4, a signal transducer and activator of transcription, upon IL-12 stimulation. This activation leads to the production of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), a key cytokine in the immune response against intracellular pathogens, such as mycobacteria (MartínezBarricarte2018Human).

IL12RB2 is primarily expressed on activated T and natural killer (NK) cells. It is crucial for the differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells into T helper 1 (Th1) cells, which are characterized by their production of IFN-γ. This differentiation process is essential for mounting an effective immune response against certain pathogens (MartínezBarricarte2018Human). The receptor's expression is upregulated by IL-12 and downregulated by IL-4, indicating its role in Th1 cell development and function (van2013IL12Rβ1). The IL-12 receptor, through IL12RB2, is involved in the activation of STAT4, which translocates to the nucleus to activate transcription of IFN-γ and other target genes, further supporting its role in immune responses (van2013IL12Rβ1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IL12RB2 gene have been implicated in several autoimmune and infectious diseases. Variants in the IL12RB2 gene are associated with leprosy, where polymorphisms in the 5' flanking region affect the expression of the gene, influencing the balance of Th1/Th2 immune responses. This variation in expression is linked to different clinical types of leprosy, with certain haplotypes being less frequent in patients with lepromatous leprosy compared to those with tuberculoid leprosy and healthy controls (Ohyama2005Polymorphism).

In primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), a chronic autoimmune liver disease, SNPs in the IL12RB2 locus, such as rs6679356, have shown significant associations. These genetic variants contribute to the risk of developing PBC, highlighting the role of IL12RB2 in the interleukin-12 signaling pathway, which is crucial for modulating autoimmune responses (Hirschfield2009Primary).

The IL12RB2 gene is also linked to ankylosing spondylitis (AS), where a SNP in the IL23R-IL12RB2 intergenic region, rs11209032, is associated with increased Th1-cell differentiation, potentially contributing to AS susceptibility (Roberts2016An). Additionally, the gene has been associated with myasthenia gravis (MG), particularly in the late-onset subgroup, where the rs6679356 variant shows a protective effect against the disease (Zagoriti2018Evidence).

## Interactions
The IL12RB2 protein is a critical component of the interleukin-12 receptor complex, interacting with IL12RB1 to form a high-affinity receptor for IL-12. This interaction is essential for the activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, particularly involving the phosphorylation and activation of STAT4, which is crucial for T-cell differentiation and the production of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) (Watford2004Signaling; Presky1996A).

IL12RB2 contains cytoplasmic tyrosine residues that serve as docking sites for STAT4. In humans, tyrosine 800 is critical for STAT4 binding, while in mice, tyrosines 757, 804, and 811 can independently bind STAT4 (Watford2004Signaling). The IL12RB2 subunit also forms disulfide-bonded dimers or oligomers at the cell surface, independent of IL-12 binding (Presky1996A).

IL12RB2 is involved in forming the receptor complex for IL-35, described as a 'non-conventional' homodimer of gp130 or IL12RB2, or a heterodimer of IL12RB2 and IL-27Ra (Tait2019The). The IL12RB2 subunit's interactions are crucial for mediating the biological activities of IL-12, including stimulating T and natural killer cell proliferation and enhancing cytotoxic activity (Presky1996A).
