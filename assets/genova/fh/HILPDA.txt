# HILPDA

## Overview
HILPDA, or Hypoxia Inducible Lipid Droplet Associated, is a gene that encodes a small protein involved in lipid metabolism, particularly under hypoxic conditions. The protein, also referred to as HILPDA, is characterized by its role in regulating lipid droplet homeostasis through interactions with key enzymes such as adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT1 and DGAT2). It functions primarily as an inhibitor of lipolysis and a promoter of triglyceride synthesis, thereby influencing lipid storage and mobilization within cells. HILPDA is predominantly located in the endoplasmic reticulum and around lipid droplets, where it modulates cellular energy homeostasis in response to environmental stressors. Its expression is notably upregulated in various cancers, where it contributes to tumor progression by promoting lipid accumulation and reducing oxidative stress, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Liu2021HILPDA; VandeKopple2019HILPDA; de2020Regulation).

## Structure
The HILPDA protein, encoded by the HILPDA gene, is a small protein consisting of 63 amino acids in humans. It features a conserved region near the N-terminus, predicted to be a transmembrane domain, which consists of 24 amino acids. This region is homologous to a segment in the protein G0S2 and is crucial for its interaction with lipid droplets and the inhibition of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) (de2020Regulation). The N-terminal domain, specifically residues 7-11, is involved in the direct interaction with ATGL, mediating its inhibitory effect on triglyceride hydrolysis (de2020Regulation).

HILPDA is located in the endoplasmic reticulum and around lipid droplets within cells, suggesting its role in lipid metabolism and storage (de2020Regulation). The protein's structure allows it to function both as an inhibitor of lipolysis and a promoter of triglyceride synthesis, interacting with enzymes like DGAT1 and DGAT2 to enhance triglyceride synthesis (de2020Regulation). While specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not provided, the protein's interaction with lipid droplets and its regulatory role in lipid metabolism are well-documented. There is no mention of post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms in the available context.

## Function
HILPDA is a protein that plays a significant role in lipid metabolism, particularly in the regulation of lipid droplet homeostasis. It is involved in lipid storage by inhibiting triglyceride hydrolysis through its interaction with adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), a key enzyme in lipolysis. This interaction is crucial for maintaining lipid droplet abundance and size, especially under conditions of hypoxia and fatty acid exposure (VandeKopple2019HILPDA; de2020Regulation). HILPDA also promotes triglyceride synthesis by interacting with diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT1 and DGAT2), with a preference for DGAT1, thereby enhancing intracellular lipid accumulation (de2020Regulation).

The protein is active in the cytoplasm, particularly around lipid droplets and the endoplasmic reticulum, where it modulates lipid storage and mobilization in response to environmental stressors (de2020Regulation). HILPDA's regulation of lipid metabolism is crucial for cellular energy homeostasis, influencing processes like lipid accumulation and energy balance in response to oxygen availability (VandeKopple2019HILPDA). Its activity is particularly important in tissues with high metabolic demands, such as adipose tissue, heart, and lung (de2020Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
HILPDA is significantly overexpressed in various tumor types and is associated with poor clinical outcomes, including worse overall survival and disease-specific survival. High HILPDA expression correlates with advanced clinical stages in cancers such as adrenocortical carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, kidney chromophobe, and liver hepatocellular carcinoma (Liu2021HILPDA). The gene's expression is linked to increased tumor-associated macrophage infiltration, contributing to tumor progression and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. This is evidenced by its positive correlation with immunosuppressive genes like PD-L1 and TGFB1 (Liu2021HILPDA).

In solid tumors, HILPDA plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism under hypoxic conditions, promoting lipid droplet formation and triglyceride storage. Its loss leads to increased lipolysis and impaired tumor growth, associated with elevated apoptosis (VandeKopple2019HILPDA). HILPDA's inhibition of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) is vital for reducing fatty acid oxidation and reactive oxygen species production, providing a survival advantage under hypoxia (Povero2020Hypoxia). These functions highlight HILPDA's role in cancer biology, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Povero2020Hypoxia).

## Interactions
HILPDA, also known as hypoxia-inducible lipid droplet-associated protein, is involved in several protein interactions that regulate lipid metabolism. It directly binds to adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and inhibits its triglyceride hydrolase activity. This interaction is particularly significant in hypoxic conditions, where HILPDA is upregulated and plays a role in inhibiting lipolysis in cancer cells (Kulminskaya2020Proteinprotein; de2020Regulation). The inhibition of ATGL by HILPDA is dose-dependent, with an IC50 value of approximately 2 mM, making it less potent than the inhibitory protein G0S2 (Kulminskaya2020Proteinprotein).

HILPDA also interacts with diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) and DGAT2, enhancing triglyceride synthesis and promoting intracellular lipid accumulation. This interaction is crucial for lipid droplet homeostasis and is observed in various cell types, including hepatocytes and cancer cells (Povero2020Hypoxia; de2020Regulation). HILPDA's role in lipid metabolism is further supported by its co-localization with lipolytic and lipogenic enzymes on lipid droplets, suggesting its involvement in lipid droplet remodeling (de2020Regulation). These interactions highlight HILPDA's multifaceted role in regulating lipid storage and hydrolysis.
