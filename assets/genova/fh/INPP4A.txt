# INPP4A

## Overview
INPP4A is a gene that encodes the enzyme inositol polyphosphate-4-phosphatase type I A, which is a critical component of phosphoinositide signaling pathways. This enzyme functions primarily as a phosphatase, specifically hydrolyzing the 4-position phosphate from inositol 3,4-bisphosphate, thereby playing a significant role in cellular processes such as growth, survival, and migration (Hamila2021The). The protein is characterized by a C2 domain, essential for calcium-dependent phospholipid binding, and a phosphatase domain that facilitates its enzymatic activity. INPP4A is predominantly expressed in the brain, where it is crucial for maintaining normal neurological function, as evidenced by severe neurodegenerative phenotypes in Inpp4a-null mice (Hamila2021The). The gene's involvement in various cellular pathways and its potential link to neurological disorders and cancer underscore its importance in cellular physiology and disease (Hamila2021The; Banihashemi2020Whole).

## Structure
INPP4A encodes an enzyme involved in phosphoinositide signaling pathways, specifically hydrolyzing the 4-position phosphate from inositol 3,4-bisphosphate. The protein structure of INPP4A includes a C2 domain, which is crucial for calcium-dependent phospholipid binding, and a phosphatase domain responsible for its enzymatic activity. These domains contribute to the protein's ability to interact with phospholipids and perform its function in signaling pathways.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence the activity and interactions of INPP4A, potentially altering its function or localization within the cell. These modifications can play a significant role in regulating the enzyme's activity in response to cellular signals.

INPP4A also exhibits splice variant isoforms, which may result in proteins with distinct functions or cellular localizations. These isoforms can provide functional diversity, allowing the protein to participate in various cellular processes or adapt to different cellular environments. The presence of these isoforms highlights the complexity of INPP4A's role in cellular signaling and its potential impact on cellular physiology.

## Function
INPP4A encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in phosphoinositide signaling pathways by dephosphorylating phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2) to produce phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P). This activity is essential for various cellular processes, including cell growth, survival, and migration (Hamila2021The). In healthy cells, INPP4A translocates to the plasma membrane following growth factor stimulation and is involved in the regulation of endosomal maturation by contributing to the pool of PtdIns(3)P on early endosomes. This promotes the recruitment of effectors necessary for endosomal maturation (Hamila2021The).

INPP4A is also involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, where it is required for membrane curvature by inducing actin polymerization through the production of PtdIns(3)P at the endocytic pit. However, recent findings suggest that INPP4A may be dispensable for this process, as it is absent from clathrin-coated pits and instead partially localizes to late endosomes, where it regulates PtdIns(3,4)P2 turnover and controls AKT activation and mTORC1 signaling (Hamila2021The). INPP4A is most highly expressed in the brain, playing a critical role in the nervous system, as evidenced by severe neurodegenerative phenotypes in Inpp4a-null mice (Hamila2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the INPP4A gene have been linked to several neurological and psychological disorders. Inpp4a-null mice exhibit severe neurological deficits, including loss of motor function and early death, due to neurodegeneration and excitotoxic neuronal cell death. This is associated with disrupted endocytic internalization of the glutamate receptor, leading to receptor hyperactivation (Hamila2021The). In humans, microdeletions in the chromosomal region encoding INPP4A are associated with psychological and cognitive disorders such as schizophrenia, and reduced INPP4A expression is observed in individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy (Hamila2021The). A novel nonsense mutation in the INPP4A gene, identified as c.115 C > T, p.Gln39X, has been found in a family with intellectual disability, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of this condition (Banihashemi2020Whole).

In cancer, low INPP4A expression correlates with poor survival in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinomas. Its depletion in mouse embryonic fibroblasts leads to increased cell proliferation and tumor development, although evidence for its role in human cancers is limited (Hamila2021The). INPP4A is also implicated in asthma pathogenesis through its role in AKT signaling in bronchial epithelial cells and may regulate platelet activation (Hamila2021The).

## Interactions
INPP4A interacts with various proteins involved in cellular signaling and membrane trafficking. It translocates to the plasma membrane following growth factor stimulation, where it dephosphorylates PtdIns(3,4)P2. In quiescent cells, INPP4A localizes to early and recycling endosomes and is recruited to forming endocytic vesicles through interaction with the small GTPase Ras-associated binding protein 5 (Rab5). This interaction facilitates the hydrolysis of PtdIns(3,4)P2 to PtdIns(3)P, contributing to endosomal maturation (Hamila2021The). 

INPP4A is also involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis by inducing actin polymerization via PtdIns(3)P production, although it may be dispensable for this process as it is absent from clathrin-coated pits (Hamila2021The). 

In the context of phagocytosis, INPP4A negatively regulates FcÎ³R-mediated phagocytosis by dephosphorylating PtdIns(3,4)P2 on the phagosomal membrane. While Rab5 is known to bind and activate INPP4A on early endosomes, it does not mediate the recruitment of INPP4A to the phagosome membrane, suggesting independent recruitment of both proteins (Nigorikawa2015Inositol). 

These interactions highlight INPP4A's role in regulating phosphoinositide signaling and maintaining cellular homeostasis.
