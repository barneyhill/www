# GJC3

## Overview
The GJC3 gene encodes the gap junction protein gamma 3, also known as connexin 30.2 or Cx31.3, which is a member of the connexin family of proteins. These proteins are integral membrane proteins characterized by their four transmembrane domains, which facilitate the formation of hemichannels and gap junctions that enable direct intercellular communication. Unlike some other connexins, GJC3 primarily forms hemichannels rather than traditional gap junction channels in certain cell types, such as HeLa cells, and is involved in ATP release and purinergic signaling (Liang2011Human; Marsh2016Simvastatin). The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, liver, and skeletal muscle, and plays a role in maintaining tissue homeostasis and cellular communication (Marsh2016Simvastatin). Mutations in the GJC3 gene have been linked to nonsyndromic hearing loss, highlighting its clinical significance (Wong2017Functional).

## Structure
The GJC3 gene encodes the gap junction protein gamma 3, also known as connexin 30.2/31.3, which is part of the connexin family. This protein is characterized by four transmembrane domains, typical of connexins, which facilitate intercellular communication through gap junction channels (Liang2011Human). The primary structure of GJC3 consists of 279 amino acids, and the protein is encoded by two exons located on chromosome 7q22.1 (Liang2011Human).

The secondary structure includes a unique N-terminal helix (NTH) conformation, which is distinct from other connexins and is positioned at the cytoplasmic entrance of the hemichannel. This NTH conformation forms a small pore, suggesting a partially closed state that selectively allows small anions to pass (Lee2020CryoEM). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains to form a hemichannel, with potential lipid-binding sites and a Ca2+-binding tunnel that are crucial for its function (Lee2020CryoEM).

In terms of quaternary structure, GJC3 assembles into a hexameric connexon, although it does not form functional gap junction channels in HeLa cells, instead exhibiting hemichannel activity (Liang2011Human). Post-translational modifications include the removal of Met 1 and partial acetylation of Cys 2 (Lee2020CryoEM).

## Function
The GJC3 gene encodes the gap junction protein gamma-3, also known as connexin 30.2 or Cx31.3, which is involved in forming hemichannels and gap junctions that facilitate intercellular communication. These channels allow for the direct exchange of ions and small molecules between adjacent cells, playing a crucial role in maintaining tissue homeostasis and enabling cell-to-cell communication (Marsh2016Simvastatin; Lee2020CryoEM).

In healthy human cells, GJC3 is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, liver, and skeletal muscle, with strong expression in heart muscle. It is implicated in ATP release and may be involved in purinergic signaling, which is linked to sympathetic vasoconstriction (Marsh2016Simvastatin). The protein forms hemichannels that are selectively permeable to chloride ions, contributing to ion transport and cellular communication (Lee2020CryoEM).

GJC3 does not form traditional gap junction channels in some cell types, such as HeLa cells, but instead facilitates ATP release through calcium-dependent hemichannels (Liang2011Human). This ATP release is significant for cellular signaling and may influence various physiological processes, including nerve and hearing development (Liang2011Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GJC3 gene, which encodes the connexin 30.2/31.3 proteins, have been associated with nonsyndromic hearing loss. A notable mutation, p.W77S, has been identified in patients with hearing loss and is known to cause significant functional alterations. This mutation affects the intracellular distribution of the protein, leading to its accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequent degradation by lysosomes and proteosomes. The p.W77S mutation exhibits a dominant negative effect, impairing the formation and function of gap junctions, which are essential for maintaining the ionic environment in the cochlea necessary for hearing (Wong2017Functional).

Other mutations in the GJC3 gene, such as p.E269D, p.R15G, and p.L23H, have also been linked to hearing loss. These mutations disrupt intercellular communication by affecting the synthesis, assembly, channel function, and degradation of connexin proteins (Wong2017Functional). However, the p.Pro164Ser variant found in the GJC3 gene in the African population has been predicted as benign and is not associated with hearing impairment, indicating that not all variants in this gene lead to clinical conditions (Adadey2020GJB4andGJC3variants).

## Interactions
The human gene GJC3 encodes the gap junction protein gamma-3, also known as connexin 30.2/31.3. This protein is involved in forming hemichannels that facilitate ATP release, rather than forming traditional gap junction channels (Liang2011Human). GJC3 interacts with simvastatin and fluvastatin, two statins that bind to its N-terminal domain. This interaction suggests a potential regulatory role in connexin hemichannel and gap junction pores, which may influence the therapeutic or adverse effects of statins (Marsh2016Simvastatin).

The interaction of GJC3 with statins is significant, as it highlights the potential role of GJC3 in cardiovascular health. Simvastatin in its hydroxyacid form shows a weak binding profile with GJC3, while fluvastatin exhibits a significant binding profile, indicating that the hydroxyacid form is crucial for interaction (Marsh2016Simvastatin). Additionally, GJC3 interacts with other small molecules like niflumic acid, flufenamic acid, and carbenoxolone, which may explain their inhibitory effects on other connexins (Marsh2016Simvastatin). These interactions suggest that GJC3 may play a role in modulating the function of connexin channels, particularly in the context of cardiovascular disease (Marsh2016Simvastatin).
