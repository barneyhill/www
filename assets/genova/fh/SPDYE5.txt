# SPDYE5

## Overview
SPDYE5 is a gene that encodes the protein speedy/RINGO cell cycle regulator family member E5, which is part of the Speedy/RINGO family of proteins. These proteins are categorized as atypical cyclins, which play a crucial role in cell cycle regulation by activating cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) (Wang2018Extensive). The SPDYE5 gene belongs to the Speedy subfamily E, which has undergone significant evolutionary expansion and functional differentiation in humans, indicating its unique roles compared to other Speedy subfamilies (Wang2018Extensive). The protein encoded by SPDYE5 is involved in cell proliferation and growth, with a broad expression profile across various human tissues, particularly in the testis, suggesting its potential involvement in reproductive functions (Wang2018Extensive). The gene's expression and evolutionary history imply its participation in post-transcriptional regulation networks and possible roles in cognitive functions, although its specific molecular activities in healthy human cells are not yet fully understood (Wang2018Extensive).

## Function
SPDYE5 is a member of the Speedy/RINGO family, which functions as atypical cyclins involved in regulating the cell cycle by activating cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) (Wang2018Extensive). This gene is part of the Speedy subfamily E, which has undergone significant expansion and functional differentiation in humans, suggesting distinct roles compared to other subfamilies (Wang2018Extensive). SPDYE5, like other Speedy genes, shows diverse binding preferences for CDKs and influences cell cycle progression, indicating its involvement in cell proliferation and growth (Wang2018Extensive).

In terms of expression, SPDYE5 is broadly expressed across various normal human tissues, with notable expression in the testis, suggesting a role in reproductive functions (Wang2018Extensive). The gene's expression profile supports the out-of-testis hypothesis, where new genes initially gain function in the testis before extending to other tissues (Wang2018Extensive). SPDYE5 may also be involved in post-transcriptional regulation networks, potentially interacting with transcribed pseudogenes and miRNA targets, which could influence its regulatory functions in the cell (Wang2018Extensive). The specific molecular activities of SPDYE5 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated, but its involvement in cell cycle regulation and potential roles in reproduction and cognitive functions are suggested by its expression patterns and evolutionary history (Wang2018Extensive).
