# ACE

## Overview
The angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) gene encodes a zinc metalloprotease enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the renin-angiotensin system, which is crucial for blood pressure regulation and fluid balance. The ACE protein, a transmembrane glycoprotein, is primarily responsible for converting angiotensin I into angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor, and for inactivating bradykinin, a vasodilator. Structurally, ACE consists of two homologous domains, the N and C domains, which contribute to its catalytic activity and membrane association. The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the vascular endothelium, lungs, and kidneys, and exists in different isoforms due to alternative splicing. Clinically, mutations and polymorphisms in the ACE gene are associated with several conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, Alzheimer's disease, and respiratory disorders, underscoring its significance in human health (Riordan2003AngiotensinIconvertingenzymeanditsrelatives; Soubrier1988Two; Danilov2024Carriers).

## Structure
The angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) is a zinc metalloprotease with a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of ACE consists of 1306 amino acids, including a 29-residue signal peptide that precedes the mature protein (Soubrier1988Two). The enzyme is composed of two homologous domains, the N and C domains, which exhibit a high degree of internal homology, with 70.1% nucleotide identity and 67.7% amino acid similarity (Soubrier1988Two). These domains contain essential residues for the active sites and are involved in the enzyme's catalytic functions (Soubrier1988Two).

The tertiary structure of ACE is characterized by its bilobal shape, with each domain contributing to the enzyme's overall conformation. The protein's hydrophobic regions suggest membrane association, with the carboxyl-terminal segment likely anchoring the enzyme to the cell membrane (Soubrier1988Two). ACE is a glycoprotein with 17 potential N-linked glycosylation sites, which are crucial for its folding, membrane targeting, and function (Danilov2018Conformational; Kryukova2015Tissue).

ACE exists in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, including somatic and testicular forms, which differ in their domain composition and tissue distribution (Cacabelos2008Pharmacogenomics; Danilov2017Conformational). These structural features are essential for ACE's role in blood pressure regulation and its interaction with various substrates.

## Function
The angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) is a crucial component of the renin-angiotensin system, primarily responsible for converting angiotensin I into angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor that plays a significant role in regulating blood pressure and fluid balance in the body (Bernstein2012A; Riordan2003AngiotensinIconvertingenzymeanditsrelatives). ACE also inactivates bradykinin, a vasodilator, contributing to blood pressure regulation (Hooper1991Angiotensin). 

ACE is a zinc-dependent peptidase with broad substrate specificity, allowing it to participate in various physiological processes beyond blood pressure control, including immunity, reproduction, and neuropeptide metabolism (Hooper1991Angiotensin; Bernstein2012A). The enzyme is expressed in high amounts in the vascular endothelium, lung, renal proximal tubular epithelium, and developing male germ cells (Bernstein2012A). 

In endothelial cells, ACE is predominantly membrane-bound, facilitating its role in converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II during blood passage through the pulmonary vasculature (Riordan2003AngiotensinIconvertingenzymeanditsrelatives). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis and fluid balance, with its expression and function being highly conserved across species (Coates2003The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ACE gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the ACE gene have been linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). These mutations can lead to reduced ACE activity, resulting in the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ42), a peptide associated with AD pathology. Specific mutations such as E738K, T887M, and N1007K are examples of those affecting ACE activity and expression, contributing to AD risk (Danilov2024Carriers).

The ACE gene is also implicated in cardiovascular diseases. The insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism in the ACE gene is associated with hypertension and myocardial infarction (MI). The D allele and DD genotype are linked to higher ACE activity, which increases susceptibility to hypertension and MI, particularly in younger individuals (Hmimech2017Impact; Patel2020Analysis). This polymorphism is also associated with increased risk and severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and COVID-19, as higher ACE activity can exacerbate these conditions (Gómez2020Angiotensinconverting; Imai2010AngiotensinConverting).

Alterations in ACE expression levels can also affect fetal development, blood pressure regulation, and male fertility, highlighting the gene's broad clinical significance (Danilov2024Carriers).

## Interactions
The angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) is involved in various interactions with bioactive peptides, which influence its activity and function. ACE interacts with peptides such as Val-Pro-Pro (VPP) and Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), which are known to inhibit its activity by binding to its catalytic site. These interactions are stabilized by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions with specific ACE residues, including Tyr 520, Gln 281, and His 513. The zinc ion at the ACE active site plays a crucial role in these interactions, coordinating with the carbonyl group of the peptides (Pina2008Studies).

ACE also interacts with other peptides like Ala-Leu-Pro-Met-His-Ile-Arg (ALPMHIR), although this peptide shows lower inhibitory potential due to steric hindrance and size limitations (Pina2008Studies). Additionally, ACE interacts with milk-derived peptides such as Ile-Pro-Ala (IPA), Phe-Pro (FP), and Gly-Lys-Pro (GKP), which inhibit its activity through hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and electrostatic interactions. These peptides also coordinate with the zinc ion, forming a distorted tetrahedral geometry at the ACE active site (Pan2011The).
