# AXIN1

## Overview
AXIN1 is a gene that encodes the axin 1 protein, a pivotal scaffold protein involved in multiple cellular signaling pathways, most notably the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Axin 1 plays a crucial role in the regulation of β-catenin levels within the cell, acting as a component of the β-catenin destruction complex, which includes other proteins such as APC, GSK3β, and CK1α. This complex is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis by preventing the accumulation of β-catenin in the nucleus, thereby inhibiting the activation of genes that drive cell proliferation (Qiu2024The; Salahshor2005The). Beyond its role in the Wnt pathway, axin 1 is involved in other signaling pathways, including the Hippo, TGFβ, AMPK, and mTOR pathways, where it facilitates interactions between kinases and their substrates, influencing processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and energy homeostasis (Qiu2024The). The protein's ability to interact with a diverse array of proteins underscores its versatile role in cellular signaling, with implications for embryonic development, tissue differentiation, and cancer development (PEĆINAŠLAUS2016AXIN1; Qiu2024The).

## Structure
AXIN1 is a scaffold protein involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its structural and functional roles. The protein contains an N-terminal RGS domain, a central intrinsically disordered region (IDR), and a C-terminal DIX domain (Anvarian2016Axin; Harnoš2018Analysis).

The RGS domain is crucial for interactions with the tumor suppressor APC and is affected by cancer mutations that can lead to structural destabilization and altered function (Anvarian2016Axin). The DIX domain, which forms a β-grasp fold similar to the ubiquitin superfamily, is involved in homodimerization and protein-protein interactions, playing a key role in the regulation of the Axin-based complex (Ehebauer2009The).

AXIN1 also interacts with tankyrase (TNKS) through two discrete segments, which are crucial for its degradation and turnover. These interactions involve specific residues forming salt bridges and hydrogen bonds with TNKS, highlighting the importance of the glycine-selection gate in the TNKS-Axin interaction (Morrone2012Crystal).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, regulate AXIN1's activity and stability, influencing its role in various signaling pathways (Harnoš2018Analysis).

## Function
The AXIN1 gene encodes a scaffold protein that plays a critical role in regulating several cellular signaling pathways, most notably the WNT/β-catenin pathway. In this pathway, AXIN1 is a key component of the β-catenin destruction complex, which includes proteins such as APC, GSK3β, and CK1α. This complex facilitates the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of β-catenin, preventing its accumulation in the nucleus and the activation of genes that promote cell proliferation (Qiu2024The; Salahshor2005The). AXIN1's regulation of β-catenin is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing uncontrolled cell growth, which is crucial for processes like embryonic development and tissue differentiation (PEĆINAŠLAUS2016AXIN1; Qiu2024The).

Beyond the WNT pathway, AXIN1 is involved in other signaling pathways, including the Hippo, TGFβ, AMPK, and mTOR pathways. It acts as a scaffold protein, facilitating interactions between kinases and their substrates, thereby regulating processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and energy homeostasis (Qiu2024The). AXIN1's ability to interact with a diverse array of proteins allows it to function in various cellular compartments, including the cytoplasm, nucleus, and cell membrane, highlighting its versatile role in cellular signaling (Qiu2024The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the AXIN1 gene are implicated in various cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), AXIN1 mutations occur in a small percentage of cases, often affecting functional domains crucial for its tumor suppressor role. These mutations can lead to the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, contributing to carcinogenesis (Salahshor2005The; Taniguchi2002Mutational). AXIN1 mutations are also found in medulloblastomas, where they disrupt the Wnt signaling pathway, potentially leading to tumor development (Baeza2003AXIN1; Salahshor2005The).

In meningiomas, AXIN1 expression and its subcellular localization are associated with other Wnt pathway components, suggesting its role in tumor progression (PEĆINAŠLAUS2016AXIN1). Reduced expression of AXIN1 is linked to tumor progression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, although mutations are rare in this cancer type (Nakajima2003Reduced). AXIN1 mutations are also observed in colorectal cancer, where they disrupt interactions with key proteins in the Wnt signaling pathway, promoting oncogenesis (Salahshor2005The).

Overall, AXIN1 mutations and alterations in its expression or interactions are associated with various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance in tumorigenesis.

## Interactions
AXIN1 interacts with a variety of proteins, playing a crucial role in the Wnt signaling pathway. It serves as a scaffold protein in the beta-catenin destruction complex, interacting with adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), and beta-catenin to facilitate the phosphorylation and degradation of beta-catenin (Salahshor2005The). AXIN1 also binds to Dishevelled (DVL) proteins, which modulate its ability to dimerize and affect its interactions with other proteins like CKI and PP2A, influencing Wnt signaling (Salahshor2005The).

AXIN1 interacts with I-mfa domain proteins, such as HIC, through its GSK-3 binding domain. This interaction can modulate AXIN1's function, affecting both Wnt and JNK signaling pathways (Kusano2002Imfa). The protein also forms complexes with MEKK1 and MEKK4, which are involved in the SAPK/JNK signaling pathway, highlighting its role in apoptosis regulation (Salahshor2005The).

Mutations in AXIN1 can lead to the formation of nanoaggregates, altering its interactions and potentially leading to increased beta-catenin activity, which is associated with tumorigenesis (Anvarian2016Axin). These interactions underscore AXIN1's central role in cellular signaling and its impact on cell growth and cancer development.
