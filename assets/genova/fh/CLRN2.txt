# CLRN2

## Overview
The CLRN2 gene encodes the clarin 2 protein, a member of the PMP-22/EMP/EP20/Claudin superfamily, characterized by its tetraspan structure with four transmembrane domains. This protein is predominantly expressed in the sensory hair cells of the inner ear, where it plays a vital role in the organization and maintenance of auditory hair bundles, essential for converting sound wave-induced mechanical energy into neuronal signals (Vona2021A; Vona2020Biallelic). Mutations in the CLRN2 gene, such as the c.494C>A variant, are linked to non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss, highlighting the gene's critical function in auditory processes (Vona2020Biallelic). The clarin 2 protein's structural integrity, particularly its transmembrane domains, is crucial for its role in maintaining the functional integrity of hair cells, with mutations leading to significant auditory impairments (Vona2021A).

## Structure
The CLRN2 gene encodes the clarin 2 protein, which is part of the PMP-22/EMP/EP20/Claudin superfamily. This protein is characterized by a tetraspan structure, consisting of four transmembrane domains, which are crucial for its function in the auditory system (Vona2021A). The primary structure of clarin 2 includes a highly conserved threonine residue at position 165, which is critical for maintaining the protein's structural integrity and function. A pathogenic variant, c.494C > A, results in a missense mutation (p.Thr165Lys) and a splicing defect, leading to a truncated protein that lacks necessary transmembrane domains, rendering it non-functional (Vona2021A).

The secondary structure of clarin 2 likely involves the arrangement of its amino acid sequences into alpha-helices, typical of transmembrane proteins (Vona2021A). The tertiary structure would describe the overall 3D folding of the protein, although specific details are not provided in the context. The quaternary structure, involving interactions with other molecules, is not detailed in the available information. Clarin 2 may undergo post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which could affect its function and localization (Vona2021A).

## Function
The CLRN2 gene encodes a tetraspan protein that is essential for normal auditory function. It is expressed in the sensory hair cells of the inner ear, where it plays a critical role in the organization and maintenance of auditory hair bundles. These hair bundles are necessary for the transduction of sound wave-induced mechanical energy into neuronal signals, a process crucial for hearing (Vona2021A; Vona2020Biallelic). The protein is involved in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the hair bundle, which is essential for sound and motion reception in inner ear hair cells (Vona2021A).

In healthy cells, CLRN2 is believed to contribute to the proper folding and transport of proteins to the plasma membrane, ensuring the functionality of the hair cells. The integrity of all four transmembrane domains of the clarin tetraspan protein is necessary for its function, as evidenced by the severe hearing loss observed in models with similar mutations (Vona2021A). The expression of CLRN2 is enriched in the inner ear, particularly in the utricle, saccule, and lagena, indicating its specific role in auditory processes (Vona2020Biallelic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CLRN2 gene are associated with non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss, a condition characterized by hearing impairment without other associated symptoms. Biallelic mutations, such as the c.494C>A variant, lead to a threonine to lysine substitution at position 165 in the clarin 2 protein. This mutation is predicted to be deleterious, causing aberrant splicing and resulting in a premature stop codon, which likely produces a truncated protein (Vona2020Biallelic). The pathogenicity of this variant is supported by its absence in population frequency databases and its impact on a highly conserved amino acid in the PMP-22/EMP/MP20/Claudin superfamily domain (Vona2020Biallelic).

Studies in zebrafish and mice have demonstrated that CLRN2 is crucial for the proper function of hair cells in the inner ear, which are essential for hearing. Mutations in CLRN2 disrupt the structure of hair cell bundles, leading to impaired mechanotransduction and hearing loss (Unknownauthors2019Abstracts; Vona2020Biallelic). In humans, these mutations follow an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, as evidenced by studies in consanguineous families (Unknownauthors2019Abstracts).
