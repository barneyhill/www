# EEF1AKMT4

## Overview
EEF1AKMT4 is a gene that encodes the protein EEF1A lysine methyltransferase 4, a member of the lysine methyltransferase family. This enzyme specifically targets lysine 36 on the eukaryotic elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1A) protein, playing a pivotal role in the regulation of mRNA translation dynamics. The methylation activity of EEF1AKMT4 is crucial for modulating the translation speed of specific codons, thereby influencing protein synthesis in human cells (Jakobsson2017Methylation; Hamey2018Methylation). The enzyme operates in the cytoplasm and is characterized by a unique sequence motif that is essential for its catalytic function, distinguishing it as part of a novel family of protein lysine methyltransferases (Jakobsson2017Methylation).

## Structure


## Function
The EEF1AKMT4 gene encodes a lysine methyltransferase that specifically targets lysine 36 on the eukaryotic elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1A) protein. This methylation plays a crucial role in modulating mRNA translation dynamics, affecting the translation speed of specific codons, such as those for asparagine, histidine, and tryptophan (Jakobsson2017Methylation). The methylation of eEF1A by EEF1AKMT4 is significant for maintaining normal translation processes in healthy human cells, as it influences the translation rates of a subset of codons and contributes to the complex regulation of protein synthesis (Jakobsson2017Methylation; Hamey2018Methylation).

In the absence of EEF1AKMT4 activity, there are changes in mRNA translation levels for numerous genes, with increased translation of ribosomal proteins and decreased translation of proteins associated with tRNA aminoacylation and the endoplasmic reticulum (Jakobsson2017Methylation). This suggests that EEF1AKMT4-mediated methylation fine-tunes the binding of certain aminoacyl-tRNAs to eEF1A, although the exact mechanism remains unclear (Hamey2018Methylation). The enzyme is active in the cytoplasm and is part of a novel family of protein lysine methyltransferases, characterized by a shared sequence motif essential for their catalytic activity (Jakobsson2017Methylation).
