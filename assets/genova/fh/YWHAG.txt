# YWHAG

## Overview
The YWHAG gene encodes the gamma isoform of the 14-3-3 protein family, a group of regulatory proteins involved in a wide array of cellular processes through protein-protein interactions. The protein encoded by YWHAG, known as tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein gamma, is characterized by its dimeric structure, which facilitates its role as a molecular scaffold in various signaling pathways. This protein is crucial for the regulation of cellular processes such as glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, and subcellular localization of key proteins, including transcription factors. YWHAG's interactions with phosphorylated proteins enable it to participate in diverse cellular functions, including neurodevelopment and heart development, as well as in pathological conditions such as cancer and viral infections (Obsil2011Structural; Xu2019YWHA1433; Fu20001433).

## Structure
The YWHAG gene encodes the gamma isoform of the 14-3-3 protein family, which plays a crucial role in regulating various cellular processes through protein-protein interactions. The primary structure of the YWHAG protein consists of a sequence of amino acids that form a dimeric structure, with each monomer comprising nine antiparallel α-helices (Obsil2011Structural; Yang2006Structural). These helices create a conserved peptide-binding groove, essential for its interaction with phosphorylated and unphosphorylated ligands (Fu20001433).

The tertiary structure of YWHAG involves the folding of these helices into a compact form, characterized by a cup-like shape with a central channel, which facilitates ligand binding (Obsil2011Structural). The quaternary structure is defined by its strong dimeric nature, with the gamma isoform predominantly forming homodimers (Yang2006Structural). The dimerization interface includes specific salt bridges and hydrophobic interactions, contributing to its stability and function (Obsil2011Structural).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are common and play a significant role in the protein's function and interaction with other proteins (Fu20001433). The structural flexibility of YWHAG allows it to adapt to various binding partners, acting as a 'molecular anvil' to facilitate protein interactions (Obsil2011Structural).

## Function
The YWHAG gene encodes the gamma isoform of the 14-3-3 protein family, which plays a crucial role in various cellular processes by interacting with phosphoserine-containing proteins. In healthy human cells, YWHAG is involved in regulating the subcellular localization of key proteins, such as Transcription Factor EB (TFEB). Under nutrient-rich conditions, YWHAG binds to phosphorylated TFEB at the S211 site, retaining it in the cytoplasm and preventing its nuclear localization. This interaction is essential for controlling the expression of TFEB target genes and cellular autophagy activity (Xu2019YWHA1433).

YWHAG also plays a significant role in glucose metabolism. It is involved in insulin-mediated glucose transport by binding to AS160, a protein that regulates GLUT4 trafficking to the plasma membrane, thereby influencing glucose uptake (Capobianco2012miRNA). Additionally, YWHAG is implicated in lipid metabolism, where it affects the cytoplasmic localization of Lipin1, a protein involved in lipid metabolic pathways (Capobianco2012miRNA).

In the context of neurodevelopment and heart development, YWHAG is crucial for normal brain and heart formation, as evidenced by studies in zebrafish models (Komoike2010Zebrafish). These functions highlight the importance of YWHAG in maintaining cellular homeostasis and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and dysregulation of the YWHAG gene have been implicated in several neurological and developmental disorders. YWHAG mutations are associated with childhood myoclonic epilepsy and febrile seizures. Specific mutations, such as a heterozygous truncating mutation (c.124C>T/p.Arg42Ter) and a de novo missense mutation (c.373A>G/p.Lys125Glu), have been identified in patients with these conditions, leading to a spectrum of epilepsy phenotypes (Ye2021YWHAG). The gene is also linked to developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE), characterized by early-onset seizures and developmental delays. Variants such as p.Arg132Cys have been observed in patients with DEE, suggesting that YWHAG haploinsufficiency may disrupt neuronal migration and contribute to the disorder (Kanani2020Expanding; Yi2022A).

Alterations in YWHAG expression levels have been associated with psychiatric disorders. Overexpression of YWHAG has been observed in individuals at ultra-high risk for psychosis, potentially impairing neurodevelopmental processes like neuronal migration and neurite formation, which may contribute to the onset of schizophrenia (Demars2020Dysregulation). In cancer, YWHAG is implicated in gastric cancer progression, where increased expression promotes proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells, correlating with poor prognosis (Ni2020Functional).

## Interactions
YWHAG, a member of the 14-3-3 protein family, is involved in numerous protein-protein interactions that are crucial for various cellular processes. It interacts with over 70 proteins, indicating a complex binding specificity or differences in abundance among family members (Collins2008Mapping). YWHAG binds to phosphorylated peptide sequences, a characteristic feature of the 14-3-3 protein family, which allows it to participate in diverse signaling pathways (Morrison2009The).

In glioblastoma cells, YWHAG interacts with MDM4, a negative regulator of the tumor suppressor p53, enhancing MDM4 phosphorylation and increasing p53 expression. This interaction is crucial for inhibiting tumor cell proliferation and metastasis (Wang2017MiR217). In lung adenocarcinoma, YWHAG binds to TXNDC9, modulating its effects on cell viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion (Wang2022TXNDC9).

YWHAG also plays a role in viral infections, specifically interacting with the influenza A virus matrix protein 2 (M2). This interaction suppresses the budding of the virus, acting as a negative regulator during infection (Mao2022YWHAG). These interactions highlight YWHAG's role in regulating cellular processes and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.
