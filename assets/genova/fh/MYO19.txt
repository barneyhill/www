# MYO19

## Overview
MYO19 is a gene located on human chromosome 17q12 that encodes the motor protein myosin XIX. Myosin XIX is an actin-based motor protein that plays a pivotal role in mitochondrial dynamics, including the movement and positioning of mitochondria within cells. This protein is characterized by its actin-activated ATPase activity and is essential for maintaining mitochondrial distribution, which is crucial for cellular energy metabolism and homeostasis (Quintero2009Human; Adikes2013Biochemical). Myosin XIX is unique in its structure, featuring a motor domain, a neck region with IQ motifs, and a distinctive tail domain that facilitates its localization to the outer mitochondrial membrane (Quintero2009Human; Shneyer2016Myo19). The protein's interactions with mitochondrial receptors, such as Miro1 and Miro2, underscore its importance in mitochondrial stability and function (Bocanegra2019The; Oeding2018Identification). Disruptions in MYO19 function can impact mitochondrial membrane potential and oxidative phosphorylation, highlighting its significance in energy production and cellular division (Rohn2014Myo19; Shi2022Mechanical).

## Structure
MYO19, or myosin XIX, is a motor protein encoded by a gene located on human chromosome 17q12. The protein consists of 970 amino acids and includes a motor domain, a neck region with three IQ motifs, and a unique tail domain. The motor domain shares approximately 35% sequence identity with other human myosins and contains conserved sequences such as GESGAGKT from the P loop and DVYGFE from switch-2, with a slightly divergent sequence in switch-1 (Quintero2009Human). The neck region's IQ motifs are expected to bind calmodulin or calmodulin-like light chains (Quintero2009Human).

The tail domain of MYO19 is basic, with a pI of approximately 9.2, and does not form a coiled coil. It lacks obvious sequence homology with other proteins except for MYO19 orthologs (Quintero2009Human). The tail domain is essential for mitochondrial localization, as it contains a specific motif that anchors MYO19 to the outer mitochondrial membrane (Shneyer2016Myo19).

MYO19's tertiary structure has been modeled using computational techniques due to the lack of well-resolved X-ray crystallography structures for its actin-binding regions (Adikes2013Biochemical). The protein is characterized by its actin-activated ATPase activity, which is crucial for its function in mitochondrial dynamics (Adikes2013Biochemical).

## Function
MYO19 (myosin XIX) is a motor protein that plays a crucial role in mitochondrial dynamics and cellular energy metabolism. It is an actin-based motor protein that localizes to mitochondria, where it facilitates their movement and positioning within the cell. This movement is essential for maintaining mitochondrial distribution, which is critical for cellular energy production and homeostasis (Quintero2009Human).

MYO19 is involved in maintaining the structural organization of mitochondrial cristae, which are essential for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and ATP generation. It acts as a mechanical tether, contributing to the effective folding of cristae, thereby sustaining energy homeostasis in cells (Shi2022Mechanical). Disruption of MYO19's function can lead to altered mitochondrial membrane potential and decreased OXPHOS, highlighting its importance in mitochondrial function (Shi2022Mechanical).

In addition to its role in energy metabolism, MYO19 is implicated in the symmetric partitioning of mitochondria during cell division. It ensures the even distribution of mitochondria, which is crucial for proper cell division and mitochondrial inheritance (Rohn2014Myo19). MYO19's interaction with actin filaments and its localization to mitochondria are mediated by its unique tail domain, which is necessary for its mitochondrial targeting (Quintero2009Human).

## Interactions
MYO19 interacts with mitochondrial receptors Miro1 and Miro2, which are crucial for its mitochondrial localization and stability. These interactions are mediated by the MyMOMA domain of MYO19, which encodes for distinct Miro-dependent and Miro-independent mechanisms of interaction with mitochondrial membranes (Bocanegra2019The; Oeding2018Identification). The interaction between MYO19 and Miro2 is influenced by the nucleotide state of the N-terminal Miro2 GTPase, with the GTP-bound state promoting stronger interactions (Bocanegra2019The). Specific mutations in MYO19 or Miro2 can disrupt their binding, highlighting the importance of electrostatic interactions in this process (Bocanegra2019The).

Miro proteins also play a role in stabilizing MYO19 by preventing its degradation, as demonstrated by the downregulation of Miro1 and Miro2 leading to a decrease in MYO19 levels (Oeding2018Identification). MYO19 shares its mitochondrial receptor with kinesin (KIF5) and dynein, suggesting a coordinated role in actin- and microtubule-based mitochondrial movements (Oeding2018Identification). These interactions are essential for the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and positioning within cells.
