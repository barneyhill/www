# ARMC6

## Overview
ARMC6 is a gene that encodes the protein armadillo repeat containing 6, which is characterized by the presence of armadillo (ARM) repeats. These repeats are crucial for protein-protein interactions, contributing to the protein's role in various cellular processes, including cell division and signaling pathways (Song2019Molecular). The ARMC6 protein is highly conserved among primates, underscoring its significance in maintaining cellular functions (Huang2021ARMC). It is involved in the regulation of asymmetric cell division and the activation of the NOTCH signaling pathway, which is essential for controlling target gene expression and is implicated in neuroblastoma tumorigenesis (Huang2021ARMC; Wang2020Prognostic). The protein's interactions with other proteins, such as Axin and β-catenin, suggest its participation in the Wnt signaling pathway and potential roles in immune responses (Song2019Molecular). Despite its involvement in critical cellular pathways, the full extent of ARMC6's clinical significance, particularly in human diseases, remains an area of active research.

## Structure
The ARMC6 protein is characterized by the presence of armadillo (ARM) repeats, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and contribute to its secondary structure by forming alpha-helical motifs (Song2019Molecular). The protein contains a central domain of tandem repeats, with a notable 51 amino acid repeat at the third position, which is longer than in any other ARMC protein (Huang2021ARMC). The N-terminus of ARMC6 is similar to the Inscuteable protein, playing a crucial role in cytoskeleton organization, cell division, and nervous system development (Huang2021ARMC). This region is essential for protein localization, spindle orientation, and RNA localization (Huang2021ARMC).

In the Pacific white shrimp, the LvARMC6 variant contains three ARM domains, as revealed by topology analysis (Song2019Molecular). The human ARMC6 gene consists of nine exons, with the Inscuteable-like region being important for controlling asymmetric cell division and activating the NOTCH signaling pathway (Huang2021ARMC). The protein's tertiary structure is likely stabilized by the interactions of these ARM domains, although specific details on the quaternary structure are not provided in the available literature. The presence of splice variant isoforms may contribute to structural diversity, affecting the protein's function and interactions.

## Function
ARMC6 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several cellular processes, particularly in cell division and signaling pathways. The ARMC6 protein is highly conserved among primates, indicating its importance in cellular functions. In humans, the ARMC6 gene consists of nine exons, and its protein product is involved in the regulation of asymmetric cell division and the activation of the NOTCH signaling pathway, which is crucial for controlling target gene expression (Huang2021ARMC).

The N-terminus of the ARMC6 protein is similar to the Inscuteable protein, which is important for cytoskeleton organization, spindle orientation, and RNA localization. This suggests that ARMC6 plays a role in maintaining cellular structure and function, particularly in processes related to cell division and nervous system development (Huang2021ARMC). The protein's involvement in the NOTCH signaling pathway further underscores its role in neuroblastoma tumorigenesis, as it is a target gene of the transcription factor MYCN, which is associated with poor prognosis in neuroblastoma patients (Huang2021ARMC; Wang2020Prognostic).

Overall, ARMC6 is active in the cytoplasm and contributes to essential cellular processes, including signal transduction and cell adhesion, through its armadillo repeat domains that facilitate protein-protein interactions.

## Clinical Significance
ARMC6 is implicated in neuroblastoma (NB), where it is identified as a target gene of the transcription factor MYCN. MYCN, associated with poor prognosis in NB patients, forms a heterodimer with MAX to regulate ARMC6 transcription. This regulation suggests that ARMC6 may promote NB tumorigenesis through the MYCN&MAX/ARMC6/NOTCH/NICD/CSL pathway (Huang2021ARMC). The N-terminus of ARMC6 is similar to Inscuteable, which is involved in asymmetric cell division and NOTCH signaling activation. Alterations in the ARMC6 gene, particularly affecting the Inscuteable-like region, could impact cell division and signaling pathways, potentially leading to dysfunction (Huang2021ARMC).

In the context of immune response, ARMC6 expression is modulated in the Pacific white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei, in response to bacterial infections. This suggests a role in disease resistance, although its clinical significance in humans remains to be fully elucidated (Song2019Molecular). While ARMC6's role in human diseases is still under investigation, its involvement in critical pathways indicates potential clinical implications. Further research is needed to clarify its role in human health and disease.

## Interactions
ARMC6 is involved in several interactions with other proteins, primarily through its armadillo repeat domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions. It is identified as a target gene of the transcription factor MYCN, which forms a heterodimer with MAX. This complex binds to the E-box DNA consensus sequence to regulate the transcription of specific target genes, including ARMC6 (Huang2021ARMC). ARMC6 also interacts with the protein histidine methyltransferase METTL9. METTL9 methylates ARMC6 at His-263, a modification confirmed through mass spectrometry analysis (Davydova2021The).

In the context of the Wnt signaling pathway, ARMC6 interacts with proteins such as Axin, glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β), and β-catenin, suggesting a role in immune responses (Song2019Molecular). These interactions indicate that ARMC6 may participate in multiprotein complexes involved in signal transduction and cellular regulation. Despite these findings, specific details about the physical interactions of ARMC6 with nucleic acids or other proteins beyond those mentioned are not extensively documented in the available literature.
