# CARD6

## Overview
CARD6 is a gene that encodes the protein caspase recruitment domain family member 6, which is involved in various cellular processes, including inflammation and apoptosis. The protein is characterized by the presence of a caspase recruitment domain (CARD) at its N-terminus, which facilitates homotypic protein-protein interactions crucial for signaling pathways related to immune responses and cell death (Dufner2006Caspase; Dufner2006CARD). CARD6 interacts with microtubules and receptor-interacting protein kinases, such as RIP2, playing a role in the activation of NF-κB, a key transcription factor in immune regulation (Dufner2008CARD6). Despite its involvement in these pathways, the precise physiological function of CARD6 remains somewhat elusive, as CARD6-deficient mice do not exhibit significant immune deficiencies (Dufner2008CARD6). The protein's ability to modulate inflammatory responses and apoptosis underscores its potential clinical significance in conditions such as cardiac hypertrophy, hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury, and rheumatoid arthritis (Zhao2020CARD6; Qin2018Caspase; Li2014Caspase).

## Structure
CARD6 is a protein characterized by a caspase recruitment domain (CARD) at its N-terminus, which is involved in homotypic protein-protein interactions. This domain is part of the death domain-fold superfamily, which is crucial for processes like programmed cell death and inflammation (Dufner2006Caspase; Dufner2006CARD). The CARD of CARD6 is homologous to the CARD of the apoptosis repressor with CARD (ARC) (Dufner2006Caspase).

The primary structure of CARD6 includes a glutamic acid-rich region and a proline-rich region at the C-terminus, which are important for its interaction with microtubules (Dufner2006Caspase; Dufner2006CARD). CARD6 also contains a region similar to upregulated gene 4 (URG4), associated with cell proliferation (Dufner2008CARD6).

CARD6 can form complexes with proteins like RICK and RIP1, although these interactions are not mediated by the CARD itself (Dufner2006Caspase; Dufner2006CARD). The CARD domain negatively regulates its interaction with RICK, suggesting a regulatory role in protein-protein interactions (Dufner2006Caspase).

CARD6 is phosphorylated by RICK or an associated kinase, indicating the presence of phosphorylation sites that may influence its function (Dufner2006Caspase). The protein can also translocate to aggresomes, suggesting a role in cellular stress responses (Dufner2006Caspase). Despite these structural insights, the physiological function of CARD6 remains unclear, as CARD6-deficient mice do not show abnormalities in immune responses (Dufner2008CARD6).

## Function
CARD6 (caspase recruitment domain family member 6) is a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in inflammation and apoptosis. It contains a caspase recruitment domain (CARD), which facilitates interactions with other proteins in signaling pathways. CARD6 is known to interact with microtubules and receptor-interacting protein kinases, such as RIP2, which are involved in NF-κB activation, a critical pathway in immune responses (Dufner2006CARD; Dufner2008CARD6).

In healthy human cells, CARD6 is implicated in the regulation of inflammatory responses and apoptosis. It has been shown to modulate NF-κB signaling, although its exact role in this pathway is complex and context-dependent, with reports of both activation and suppression of NF-κB (Qin2018Caspase). CARD6 also interacts with the kinase ASK1, inhibiting its activity and thereby reducing inflammation and cell death, which is particularly relevant in the context of hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury (Qin2018Caspase).

CARD6 is inducible by interferons, suggesting a role in immune defense, although its precise physiological function in immune signaling remains unclear. CARD6-deficient mice do not exhibit significant immune deficiencies, indicating that CARD6 may not be essential for basic immune functions (Dufner2008CARD6).

## Clinical Significance
CARD6 (caspase recruitment domain family member 6) has been implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression or function. In cardiac conditions, CARD6 expression is significantly increased in failing dilated cardiomyopathic hearts, and its upregulation is associated with alleviating pathological cardiac hypertrophy. Conversely, CARD6 downregulation can promote cardiac hypertrophy and failure, as evidenced by increased heart size and fibrosis in CARD6 knockout mice (Li2014Caspase).

In hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, CARD6 plays a protective role by reducing liver damage and inflammation. CARD6 deficiency leads to increased liver damage and inflammation, while its overexpression reduces these effects. This protective function is mediated through the suppression of ASK1, a kinase involved in apoptotic and inflammatory pathways (Qin2018Caspase).

In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), CARD6 is downregulated in activated macrophages, leading to increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Overexpression of CARD6 in a mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis reduces inflammation and joint destruction by inhibiting the TNFR1/TRAF2 signaling pathway, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for RA (Zhao2020CARD6).

Overall, CARD6's role in modulating inflammatory and apoptotic pathways highlights its clinical significance in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
CARD6 interacts with several proteins, primarily through its caspase recruitment domain (CARD). It forms complexes with RICK (also known as CARDIAK and RIP2), a member of the RIP family of protein kinases. This interaction is not mediated by their CARD domains; instead, the CARD of CARD6 inhibits the binding of these molecules. The core region of CARD6 (amino acids 282-949) is sufficient for binding to RICK, and this interaction is negatively affected by the CARD of CARD6 (Dufner2006Caspase; Dufner2006CARD).

CARD6 also interacts with RIP1, another RIP kinase homologue that lacks a CARD but has a C-terminal death domain. The interaction between RIP1 and CARD6 does not require RIP1 kinase activity or the death domain of RIP1, and the core region of CARD6 is sufficient for this interaction (Dufner2006Caspase).

Coexpression of RICK with CARD6 induces relocalization of CARD6 to aggresomes, which are inclusion bodies formed at the centrosome. This relocalization requires the CARD of RICK (Dufner2006CARD). CARD6 can also serve as a substrate for RICK or RIP1 in vitro, as shown by kinase assays (Dufner2006Caspase).
