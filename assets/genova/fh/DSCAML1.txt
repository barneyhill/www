# DSCAML1

## Overview
DSCAML1 (Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule like 1) is a gene that encodes the DS cell adhesion molecule like 1 protein, a transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. This protein is characterized by its complex structure, which includes multiple immunoglobulin and fibronectin-type III domains, and plays a crucial role in neural development. DSCAML1 is primarily expressed in the nervous system, where it facilitates cell-cell interactions and signaling pathways essential for the formation and maintenance of neural networks. It is involved in synaptic localization, neuronal migration, and axonal projection, contributing to the proper development of the cerebral cortex and retina. Mutations in the DSCAML1 gene have been linked to various neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, and epilepsy, highlighting its significance in maintaining neural function and structure (Zhang2015DSCAM; Hayase2020Down; Ogata2021Potential).

## Structure
The DSCAML1 protein is a transmembrane protein that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily. It features a complex molecular structure with ten immunoglobulin (Ig) domains and six fibronectin-type III domains in its extracellular region (Hayase2020Down; Ogata2021Potential). The intracellular region of DSCAML1 includes a PSD-95/Discs Large/ZO-1 (PDZ) binding motif, which is important for interactions with scaffolding proteins (Garrett2016Replacing; Ogata2021Potential).

Post-translational modifications of DSCAML1 include glycosylation, which affects its molecular weight and function. Immunoblot analysis has shown that DSCAML1 undergoes N-glycosylation, with mature N-glycan complexes forming in the trans-Golgi network (Ogata2021Potential). This glycosylation is crucial for the protein's proper localization and function, as mutations affecting glycosylation can lead to functional defects (Ogata2021Potential).

Mutations in DSCAML1 can result in altered protein structure and function. For example, the DSCAML1 C729R mutation disrupts a disulfide bond in the Ig domain, affecting the protein's adhesive ability and cell surface localization (Ogata2021Potential). The protein's structure and function are also influenced by alternative splicing, which can produce different isoforms with potentially distinct roles in cellular processes (Hayase2020Down).

## Function
DSCAML1 (DS cell adhesion molecule like 1) is a protein that plays a significant role in neural development by facilitating cell-cell interactions and signaling pathways. It is primarily active in the nervous system, where it contributes to the formation and maintenance of neural networks essential for proper brain function. DSCAML1 is involved in synaptic localization, particularly in the synaptic clefts of primary hippocampal neurons, where it is found along dendrites and spines (Ogata2021Potential). This protein is crucial for regulating synapse number, as its wild-type form restricts the number of mature synapses, which is important for maintaining synaptic balance in healthy cells (Ogata2021Potential).

DSCAML1 also plays a role in neuronal migration and axonal projection during brain development. It is essential for the proper radial migration of cortical neurons and the projection of callosal axons, ensuring that neurons reach their correct positions in the cerebral cortex (Zhang2015DSCAM). In the retina, DSCAML1 is involved in promoting self-avoidance among neurons, preventing clustering and ensuring proper neural network formation (Garrett2016Replacing). The protein's adhesive properties are mediated by glycosylation, which is crucial for its function in cell adhesion (Ogata2021Potential).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DSCAML1 gene have been implicated in several neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability, and schizophrenia. Specific mutations such as C729R, R1685*, and K2108Nfs*37 have been identified in patients with ASD, affecting the protein's structure and function, which may impair synapse regulation and contribute to the pathology of these disorders (Ogata2021Potential). The C729R mutation disrupts protein conformation, while R1685* results in a truncated protein, and K2108Nfs*37 leads to proteasome-dependent degradation (Ogata2021Potential).

DSCAML1 mutations are also associated with epilepsy. The A2105T mutation, identified in a patient with epilepsy, causes a loss of function by altering the cellular localization of DSCAML1, leading to seizure susceptibility (Hayase2020Down). This mutation has been studied in knock-in mice, which exhibit seizure-like phenotypes and reduced inhibitory neurons, suggesting a link between DSCAML1 mutations and epilepsy (Hayase2020Down).

Alterations in DSCAML1 expression or function can lead to congenital stationary night blindness, as seen in Dscaml1 mutant mice, which show synaptic and mitochondrial dysfunction in the retina (Clemons2023The).

## Interactions
DSCAML1 (DS cell adhesion molecule like 1) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in neural development. It interacts with several cytoplasmic binding partners, including IPO5, DYRK1A, DYRK1B, SH2D2A, STAT3, and USP21. These interactions were identified using the mammalian protein-protein interaction trap (MAPPIT) method and confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Specific binding motifs for STAT3, SH2D2A, and USP21 were identified within the intracellular domains of DSCAML1, highlighting their role as binding sites (Sachse2019Nuclear).

DSCAML1 also interacts with multi-PDZ domain-containing proteins, which are important for its role in synapse maturation and self-avoidance. These interactions are dynamic and transient, with increased co-localization during development (Garrett2016Replacing). The C-terminal PDZ-binding motif of DSCAML1 is crucial for its stability and function, as mutations affecting this region lead to proteasome-dependent degradation and impaired synaptic functions (Ogata2021Potential).

The DSCAML1 C729R mutation disrupts its adhesive properties by affecting a cysteine residue in the seventh Ig domain, which is essential for glycosylation and adhesion (Ogata2021Potential). This mutation impairs the protein's ability to bind to itself and to wild-type DSCAML1, indicating the importance of this domain for its adhesive function.
