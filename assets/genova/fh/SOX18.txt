# SOX18

## Overview
SOX18 is a gene that encodes the SRY-box transcription factor 18, a member of the SOXF family of transcription factors. This protein is characterized by its high-mobility group (HMG) DNA-binding domain, which plays a pivotal role in vascular development, particularly in the differentiation of endothelial cells and the formation of blood and lymphatic vessels (Klaus2016Structure; Moustaqil2018Homodimerization). The SOX18 protein is unique among its family members due to its ability to switch between monomeric and dimeric forms, a feature that is crucial for its function in regulating endothelial-specific genes (Moustaqil2018Homodimerization). Mutations in the SOX18 gene are linked to various disorders, including Hypotrichosis-Lymphedema-Telangiectasia and Renal Syndrome (HLTRS), which affect hair follicle development, fluid accumulation, and vascular integrity (Moalem2014Hypotrichosis‐lymphedema‐telangiectasia‐renal; Moustaqil2018Homodimerization). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its involvement in cardiovascular development and its potential impact on conditions such as congenital heart disease (Shi2022Identification).

## Structure
The SOX18 protein is a member of the SOXF family of transcription factors and is characterized by a high-mobility group (HMG) DNA-binding domain. The primary structure of SOX18 includes a 79 amino acid HMG box, which is crucial for its DNA-binding capability (Klaus2016Structure). This HMG box forms a three-helix bundle with an L-shaped structure, where helix 3 constitutes the long arm and helices 1 and 2 form the short arm (Klaus2016Structure). The tertiary structure of SOX18 involves the binding of the HMG box to the minor groove of DNA, following the contours of the concave binding surface (Klaus2016Structure).

SOX18 also contains a unique 50 amino acid region adjacent to the third α-helix of the HMG box, known as the DIM domain, which is essential for its homodimerization. This dimerization is DNA-independent and is crucial for the protein's role in endothelial cell fate determination (Moustaqil2018Homodimerization). The DIM domain includes a hydrophobic sequence, FRELPPL, which is specific to SOX18 and plays a significant role in its homodimerization (Moustaqil2018Homodimerization). The protein can switch between monomeric and dimeric forms, a feature not shared by other SOXF family members (Moustaqil2018Homodimerization).

## Function
SOX18 is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in vascular development, particularly in endothelial cell differentiation and the formation of blood and lymphatic vessels. It is part of the SOXF family, which includes SOX7 and SOX17, but is unique for its ability to switch between monomeric and dimeric forms. This dimerization is essential for its function, as it selectively regulates a subset of endothelial-specific genes by recruiting key transcription factors such as RBPJ and MEF2C (Moustaqil2018Homodimerization).

SOX18's dimerization is driven by a novel motif near the C-terminus of the DNA binding region, which is not present in SOX7 or SOX17. This process is DNA-independent and involves specific protein interactions that influence gene expression (Moustaqil2018Homodimerization). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA motifs characterized by a palindrome of the SOX motif spaced by five nucleotides (IR5), regulating genes involved in vascular endothelial functions (Moustaqil2018Homodimerization).

Mutations in SOX18 are linked to disorders such as Hypotrichosis-Lymphedema-Telangiectasia and Renal Syndrome (HLTRS), affecting hair follicle development, fluid accumulation, and vascular integrity (Moustaqil2018Homodimerization).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SOX18 gene are associated with hypotrichosis-lymphedema-telangiectasia syndrome (HLTS), a rare disorder characterized by sparse hair, lymphedema, and vascular abnormalities. These mutations can be either autosomal dominant or recessive, with dominant mutations often resulting in truncated proteins that disrupt the gene's normal function (Bastaki2016A; Wangberg2018A). The phenotypic spectrum of SOX18 mutations is broad, ranging from mild hair and lymphatic defects to severe conditions such as renal failure and aortic dilation (Moalem2014Hypotrichosis‐lymphedema‐telangiectasia‐renal; Wünnemann2016Aortic).

In some cases, SOX18 mutations have been linked to congenital heart disease, including patent ductus arteriosus and pulmonary stenosis, highlighting the gene's role in cardiovascular development (Shi2022Identification). The mutations can lead to impaired lymphangiogenesis and vascular integrity, contributing to symptoms like edema and telangiectasia (Downes2009Vascular; Moleri2023Lymphatic). The variability in clinical presentation suggests that SOX18 mutations can have diverse effects depending on the specific mutation and genetic background (Wünnemann2016Aortic). These findings underscore the importance of SOX18 in maintaining vascular and lymphatic system function.

## Interactions
SOX18 is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in vascular development and interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids. It is unique among the SOXF family members for its ability to form homodimers, a process driven by a specific dimerization domain near the C-terminus of the DNA binding region. This dimerization is crucial for SOX18's function, allowing it to recruit key endothelial transcription factors such as MEF2C and RBPJ in a 2:1 interaction ratio, while monomeric SOX18 recruits RXRA in a 1:1 ratio (Moustaqil2018Homodimerization).

SOX18's dimerization is DNA-independent and involves a unique 50 amino acid region adjacent to the HMG-box. This region is essential for its interaction with specific DNA motifs, particularly a palindromic doublet of SOX-binding consensus sequences spaced by 5 nucleotides (IR5) (Moustaqil2018Homodimerization). The dimerization enables SOX18 to selectively regulate a subset of endothelial-specific genes, impacting endothelial differentiation and vascular development (Moustaqil2018Homodimerization).

SOX18 also interacts with the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) genome, enhancing viral genome copies by binding near the origins of replication. This interaction increases the number of viral episomes and moderately boosts lytic transcripts and proteins (Gramolelli2020Oncogenic).
