# MED12L

## Overview
The MED12L gene encodes the protein mediator complex subunit 12L, which is a component of the Mediator complex, a critical coactivator in the transcription of nearly all RNA polymerase II-dependent genes. This protein functions as part of the kinase module within the Mediator complex, which is involved in both transcriptional repression and activation. MED12L is predominantly expressed in the brain and is localized to the nucleus, where it plays a significant role in chromatin regulation and mRNA processing. Variants in the MED12L gene have been linked to intellectual disabilities and transcriptional defects, underscoring its importance in neurological development and function (Nizon2019Variants).

## Function
The MED12L gene encodes a protein that is a component of the Mediator complex, which is crucial for the transcriptional coactivation of nearly all RNA polymerase II-dependent genes. This complex acts as a bridge linking gene-specific transcription activators with the basal transcription machinery, facilitating the transfer of genetic information from DNA-binding proteins to RNA polymerase II, thereby playing a key role in gene expression regulation (Nizon2019Variants).

MED12L is primarily localized to the nucleus and is mainly expressed in the brain. It is predicted to be a subunit of the kinase module within the Mediator complex, which includes other subunits such as MED12, MED13, MED13L, CDK8, CDK19, and Cyclin C. This kinase module is involved in transcriptional repression and activation, potentially through its kinase activity when recruited to upstream activation regions or enhancers (Nizon2019Variants).

The Mediator complex, including MED12L, plays a role in chromatin regulation and mRNA processing. Variants in MED12L have been associated with intellectual disability and transcriptional defects, indicating its importance in neurological development and function (Nizon2019Variants).
