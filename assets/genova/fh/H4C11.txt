# H4C11

## Overview
H4C11 is a gene that encodes the H4 clustered histone 11 protein, a variant of histone H4, which is a core component of the nucleosome in eukaryotic cells. Histone H4 proteins, including those encoded by H4C11, are integral to the structural organization of chromatin, facilitating the packaging of DNA into nucleosomes and thereby influencing DNA accessibility for replication, repair, and transcription (Dong2022Identification; Han2022Identification). The H4 clustered histone 11 protein plays a critical role in chromatin dynamics and gene regulation, impacting cellular processes such as differentiation and ossification (Han2022Identification). Alterations in the expression of H4C11 have been associated with various pathological conditions, including cancer, where it may influence tumor progression and response to treatment (Li2024Transcriptome; Hekmatshoar2024The).

## Function
H4C11 encodes a histone protein, specifically histone H4, which is a core component of the nucleosome structure in eukaryotic cells. Histone H4, including H4C11, plays a crucial role in the packaging of DNA into chromatin, facilitating the organization and compaction of DNA within the nucleus (Dong2022Identification; Han2022Identification). This structural role is essential for the regulation of DNA accessibility, impacting processes such as DNA replication, repair, and transcription regulation. The binding of linker histone H1 to the nucleosome further promotes higher-order chromatin organization, which is vital for maintaining genome stability and regulating gene expression (Dong2022Identification).

H4C11 is involved in the initiation of DNA template transcription and has been noted to negatively regulate megakaryocyte differentiation (Han2022Identification). The gene is also associated with osteoblast differentiation and the positive regulation of ossification, suggesting a role in bone formation processes (Han2022Identification). Although specific functions of H4C11 in healthy human cells are not detailed, its involvement in chromatin structure and transcription initiation highlights its importance in fundamental cellular processes (Han2022Identification).

## Clinical Significance
The H4C11 gene, encoding a histone protein, has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in chromatin structure and gene expression. In the context of cancer, alterations in H4C11 expression have been observed in several studies. For instance, in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), H4C11 was identified as a downregulated gene in olaparib-treated cells, suggesting its involvement in the metabolic pathways affected by the treatment (Hekmatshoar2024The). Similarly, in bladder cancer, H4C11 was among the most downregulated genes following isorhapontigenin treatment, indicating its potential role in modifying the tumor microenvironment and actin cytoskeleton, which are crucial for cancer cell proliferation (Li2024Transcriptome).

In colon adenocarcinoma, H4C11 was highlighted as a significant node in a protein-protein interaction network, although specific details on its role in the disease were not provided (Zhang2022Downregulation). Additionally, in human dermal fibroblasts subjected to mechanical stretch, H4C11 was downregulated, suggesting its involvement in chromatin alterations during cellular stress responses (Dong2022Identification). These findings underscore the gene's potential clinical significance in various pathological conditions, particularly in cancer.

## Interactions
H4C11, a histone H4 protein, is a fundamental component of chromatin, playing a crucial role in the nucleosome structure of chromosomal fibers in eukaryotes. It interacts with DNA and other histones, such as H2A, H2B, and H3, to form nucleosomes, which are essential for DNA packaging and regulation. These interactions facilitate the structural organization of chromatin and are vital for processes such as DNA replication, repair, and transcription regulation (Han2022Identification).

In the context of mechanical stretch in human dermal fibroblasts, H4C11 is downregulated, indicating its involvement in chromatin organization and potential regulation of cell proliferation (Dong2023Corrigendum:). This downregulation suggests that H4C11 may participate in dynamic chromatin remodeling in response to mechanical stimuli, although specific protein interactions in this context are not detailed.

In triple-negative breast cancer cells treated with olaparib, H4C11 is also downregulated, highlighting its potential role in the cellular response to DNA damage and repair mechanisms, although specific interactions remain unexplored (Hekmatshoar2024The). Despite its recognized importance in chromatin structure, detailed interactions of H4C11 with other proteins or nucleic acids in various biological contexts remain to be fully elucidated.
