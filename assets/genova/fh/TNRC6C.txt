# TNRC6C

## Overview
TNRC6C is a gene that encodes the protein trinucleotide repeat containing adaptor 6C, a member of the GW182 protein family. This protein plays a pivotal role in microRNA (miRNA)-mediated gene silencing, a process crucial for regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. TNRC6C is characterized by its interaction with Argonaute proteins, facilitating the formation of microRNA ribonucleoprotein complexes (miRNPs) that mediate translational repression and mRNA degradation. The protein contains several functional domains, including a ubiquitin-associated (UBA)-like domain, a C-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), and glycine-tryptophan (GW) repeat regions, which are essential for its interactions and silencing functions. TNRC6C is expressed in various human cell lines and is involved in compensatory mechanisms with its paralogs, TNRC6A and TNRC6B, to maintain miRNA-mediated gene silencing. Its dysregulation has been implicated in several cancers, highlighting its significance in cellular processes and potential as a therapeutic target (Lazzaretti2009The; Liu2019Expression; Zipprich2009Importance).

## Structure
The TNRC6C protein is a member of the GW182 family and plays a crucial role in miRNA-mediated repression. Its molecular structure includes several key domains: a central ubiquitin-associated (UBA)-like domain, a C-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), and regions rich in glycine-tryptophan (GW) repeats. These GW repeats are divided into N-terminal, middle, and C-terminal regions, with the N-terminal region essential for interaction with Argonaute proteins (AGO1-AGO4) (Lazzaretti2009The). The C-terminal domain, particularly the DN1370 fragment, is critical for translational repression and includes the DUF and RRM domains. The RRM domain is involved in RNA binding and potentially in protein-protein interactions (Zipprich2009Importance).

The TNRC6C protein also contains a Q-rich region between the UBA-like domain and the RRM, which is necessary for its accumulation in P-bodies, although this localization is not required for its silencing activity (Lazzaretti2009The). The C-terminal region, referred to as the silencing domain, can function independently of Argonaute proteins, indicating that TNRC6C can silence bound mRNAs without Argonaute interaction (Lazzaretti2009The). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, and it has several isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can affect its functional properties.

## Function
TNRC6C is a protein that plays a crucial role in miRNA-mediated gene silencing in human cells. It is part of the GW182 protein family, which interacts with Argonaute proteins to form microRNPs involved in translational repression and mRNA degradation (Zipprich2009Importance). TNRC6C is expressed in HEK293 and HeLa cells and is essential for the efficient repression of target mRNA reporters by endogenous let-7 miRNP (Zipprich2009Importance). The protein primarily affects translation rather than mRNA stability, with its C-terminal domain, particularly the DN1370 fragment, playing a key role in this process (Zipprich2009Importance).

The DN1370 fragment of TNRC6C, which includes the RNA-binding RRM domain, is critical for translational repression, functioning independently of Argonaute proteins (Lazzaretti2009The; Zipprich2009Importance). This fragment can repress protein synthesis significantly, indicating its potent role in gene silencing (Zipprich2009Importance). TNRC6C also compensates for the loss of its paralogs, TNRC6A and TNRC6B, suggesting a redundant function in maintaining miRNA-mediated gene silencing (Liu2019Expression). The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it facilitates mRNA degradation or translational repression, contributing to the regulation of gene expression in healthy human cells (Lazzaretti2009The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TNRC6C gene have been implicated in various cancers, including papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and thyroid carcinoma (TC). In PTC, TNRC6C is downregulated by the long non-coding antisense RNA TNRC6C-AS1, which is upregulated in cancerous tissues. This suppression of TNRC6C promotes cancer progression by enhancing cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while reducing apoptosis and iodine uptake in PTC cells (Muhanhali2018Long). The TNRC6C protein is part of the GW182 family, which is involved in miRNA-mediated mRNA repression, and its expression is downregulated in various cancers, including gastric, colorectal, and non-small cell lung cancers (Muhanhali2018Long).

In thyroid carcinoma, TNRC6C-AS1 also plays a role by promoting methylation of the STK4 gene, leading to reduced STK4 expression and activation of the Hippo signaling pathway. This results in increased proliferation and tumorigenicity of TC cells, while inhibiting apoptosis and autophagy (Peng2019Long). These findings suggest that TNRC6C and its regulatory interactions are significant in the progression of thyroid-related cancers, highlighting the potential of targeting these pathways for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
TNRC6C, a member of the GW182 protein family, is involved in miRNA-mediated gene silencing and interacts with various proteins and complexes. It interacts with Argonaute proteins (AGO1-AGO4) through its N-terminal GW-repeat-containing region, which is crucial for recruiting these proteins to miRNA targets (Lazzaretti2009The). The C-terminal domain of TNRC6C, known as the silencing domain, can silence bound transcripts independently of Argonaute proteins, indicating its role in translational repression and mRNA degradation (Lazzaretti2009The).

TNRC6C's W-motifs are essential for its interactions with several proteins, including components of the CCR4-NOT complex, which is involved in RNA degradation (mauri2017interactome). These motifs also facilitate interactions with clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) and the AP2 adaptor protein complex, suggesting a role in vesicular trafficking (mauri2017interactome). Additionally, TNRC6C interacts with DEAD-box RNA helicases DDX20 and DDX46 in a W-motif-specific manner (mauri2017interactome).

TNRC6C is also subject to regulation by TRIM65, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates TNRC6 proteins, leading to their degradation and modulating miRNA activity (Li2014TRIM65). These interactions highlight TNRC6C's multifaceted role in miRNA-mediated silencing and cellular processes.
