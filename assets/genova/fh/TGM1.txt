# TGM1

## Overview
The TGM1 gene encodes the enzyme transglutaminase 1 (TGase-1), a member of the transglutaminase family, which plays a pivotal role in the formation of the cornified cell envelope (CCE) in the epidermis. This enzyme is essential for maintaining the skin's barrier function by catalyzing the cross-linking of structural proteins, thereby contributing to the mechanical strength and impermeability of the skin. TGase-1 is characterized by a catalytic core domain and functions as a dimer, with its activity regulated by calcium ions. Mutations in the TGM1 gene are linked to autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis, particularly lamellar ichthyosis, highlighting its clinical significance in dermatological conditions (Kalinin2002Epithelial; Herman2009Transglutaminase1; Hennies1998Genetic).

## Structure
The TGM1 gene encodes the transglutaminase 1 (TGase-1) enzyme, which plays a crucial role in the formation of the cornified cell envelope in the epidermis. The primary structure of TGase-1 consists of 817 amino acid residues, resulting in a protein with a molecular weight of approximately 89 kDa (Herman2009Transglutaminase1). The secondary structure includes conserved alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which are common among TGase-like proteins, showing 60-75% conservation (Kim1992Structure).

The tertiary structure of TGase-1 is characterized by a catalytic core domain, which is highly conserved and essential for its enzymatic activity. This domain includes a catalytic triad composed of cysteine, histidine, and aspartate residues (Herman2009Transglutaminase1). The enzyme also contains an amino-terminal beta-sandwich domain and two carboxy-terminal beta-barrel domains, contributing to its overall three-dimensional conformation (Terrinoni2012Novel).

TGase-1 functions as a dimer, indicating a quaternary structure, and is regulated by calcium ions, which enhance its activity through isomerization of peptide bonds (Terrinoni2012Novel; Herman2009Transglutaminase1). Post-translational modifications, such as proteolytic cleavage, significantly increase the enzyme's activity (Terrinoni2012Novel).

## Function
Transglutaminase 1 (TGM1) is an enzyme crucial for the formation of the cornified cell envelope (CCE) in the epidermis, which is essential for maintaining the skin's barrier function. TGM1 catalyzes the cross-linking of proteins through the formation of isopeptide bonds between glutamine and lysine residues, contributing to the structural integrity and insolubility of the CCE (Kalinin2002Epithelial; Surbek2023Cornification). This process is vital for the assembly of the cornified envelope, a membranous structure that provides mechanical strength and resistance against chemical and microbial invasions (Kuramoto2002Development).

TGM1 is active in the cytoplasm and cell membrane of keratinocytes, where it facilitates the cross-linking of proteins such as loricrin, involucrin, and small proline-rich proteins, forming a robust barrier that protects against environmental damage (Chermnykh2020Transglutaminase; Surbek2023Cornification). The enzyme is also involved in the esterification of ceramides, forming lipid ester linkages essential for the lipid envelope assembly, which is critical for maintaining the water barrier function of the skin (Kalinin2002Epithelial). TGM1's activity is regulated by calcium ions, which activate the enzyme, and its function is distinct from other transglutaminases, highlighting its unique role in epidermal cornification (Herman2009Transglutaminase1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TGM1 gene are primarily associated with autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI), particularly lamellar ichthyosis (LI). This condition is characterized by dry, scaly skin due to impaired skin barrier function. TGM1 mutations lead to a deficiency in the transglutaminase 1 enzyme, which is crucial for forming the cornified cell envelope in the epidermis, resulting in increased transepidermal water loss and skin abnormalities (Herman2009Transglutaminase1; Hennies1998Genetic).

The clinical manifestations of TGM1-related ichthyosis can vary widely, reflecting the genetic heterogeneity of the condition. Some patients exhibit severe phenotypes, such as collodion membrane at birth, while others may have milder forms like bathing suit ichthyosis, which spares the limbs (Herman2009Transglutaminase1). Ocular manifestations, including eyelid abnormalities and corneal scarring, are also reported in patients with TGM1 mutations (MacrizRomero2023Ophthalmic).

Studies have identified numerous mutations in TGM1, including missense, nonsense, and splice-site mutations, which can lead to varying degrees of enzyme impairment (Shevchenko2000Splicesite; CserhalmiFriedman2001Diagnosis). The genetic and clinical heterogeneity of TGM1 mutations complicates the establishment of a clear genotype-phenotype correlation (Hennies1998Genetic).

## Interactions
Transglutaminase 1 (TGM1) is involved in several interactions crucial for its function in the epidermis. TGM1 interacts with proteins such as loricrin and filaggrin, which are essential for the formation of the cornified envelope, a critical component of the skin barrier. The enzyme facilitates the cross-linking of these proteins, contributing to the structural integrity of the epidermis (Matsuki1998Defective).

TGM1 also interacts with calpain small subunit 1 (CAPNS1), a subunit of calpain, which is a calcium-activated cysteine protease. This interaction suggests that calpain may regulate TGM1 activity. Inhibition of calpain has been shown to reduce TGM1-mediated transglutamination, indicating that calpain activity is necessary for TGM1 function (Surbek2023Cornification).

Additionally, TGM1 is involved in a complex with cathepsin D (CTSD), which is implicated in the proteolytic processing and activation of TGM1. CTSD is necessary for the conversion of TGM1 from its precursor form to its active form, which is essential for epidermal differentiation and barrier repair (Egberts2004Cathepsin). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of TGM1 in skin physiology.
