# CYP7B1

## Overview
CYP7B1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily B member 1, a crucial component of the cytochrome P450 superfamily. This enzyme is primarily involved in the hydroxylation of steroids and oxysterols, playing a significant role in cholesterol homeostasis and bile acid synthesis. As a monooxygenase, CYP7B1 catalyzes the 7α-hydroxylation of oxysterols and neurosteroids, impacting various physiological processes, including neuroprotection and cognitive functions. The enzyme is predominantly expressed in the liver and brain, where it influences neurosteroid pathways and contributes to an alternative bile acid biosynthesis pathway. Mutations in the CYP7B1 gene are linked to several clinical conditions, including hereditary spastic paraplegia type 5 and infantile progressive intrahepatic cholestasis, highlighting its importance in human health (Pettersson2009CYP7B1mediated; Yantsevich2014Human; Wu1999Structure).

## Structure
The human gene CYP7B1 encodes a cytochrome P450 enzyme involved in the hydroxylation of steroids and oxysterols. The primary structure of CYP7B1 consists of 506 amino acids, with a notable N-terminal membrane-binding domain comprising the first 38 residues, which is highly hydrophobic (Wu1999Structure). The tertiary structure of CYP7B1 includes a heme-binding domain, where the heme iron is covalently bound to the thiolate group of a conserved cysteine residue, Cys449 (Cui2012Structural). This structural feature is crucial for its enzymatic activity.

The secondary structure of CYP7B1 is characterized by 18 helices and 9 sheets, as revealed by homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulations (Cui2012Structural). The enzyme's active site is medium-sized, accommodating substrates with medium chain lengths, and is influenced by key residues such as Trp291 and Phe489, which are important for substrate selectivity and binding (Cui2012Structural).

CYP7B1 does not have a quaternary structure as it functions as a monomer. The enzyme's structure is further stabilized by hydrophobic interactions, particularly involving a cluster of phenylalanine residues that form a hydrophobic core (Cui2012Structural). There is no detailed information on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms in the provided context.

## Function
The CYP7B1 gene encodes the enzyme oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase, which plays a crucial role in the metabolism of oxysterols and steroids in human cells. This enzyme is involved in the 7α-hydroxylation of oxysterols such as 25- and 27-hydroxycholesterol, converting them into 7α,25-dihydroxycholesterol, a process important for maintaining cholesterol homeostasis and bile acid synthesis (Yantsevich2014Human; Wu1999Structure). CYP7B1 is also active in the metabolism of neurosteroids, including dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and pregnenolone (PREG), which are significant for neuroprotection and cognitive functions (Yantsevich2014Human; Wu1999Structure).

The enzyme is expressed in various tissues, with high activity in the liver and brain, particularly in the hippocampus, where it influences neurosteroid pathways and potentially modulates GABA A receptor function (Yantsevich2014Human; Pettersson2009CYP7B1mediated). In the liver, CYP7B1 contributes to an alternative bile acid biosynthesis pathway, crucial for converting cholesterol into primary bile acids, thus preventing the accumulation of toxic oxysterols (Kakiyama2019Mitochondrial; Setchell1998Identification). The enzyme's activity is essential for regulating cellular levels of androgens and neurosteroids, impacting both androgenic and neurosteroid pathways in human cells (Pettersson2009CYP7B1mediated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CYP7B1 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. Notably, these mutations can lead to hereditary spastic paraplegia type 5 (SPG5), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive lower limb spasticity and weakness due to the degeneration of motor neuron axons in the spinal cord (Yantsevich2014Human; Chen2020AKR1D1). In infancy, CYP7B1 mutations can cause fatal infantile progressive intrahepatic cholestasis, often resulting in liver failure (Tang2021Successful). Treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid has shown promise in improving liver function in affected infants (Tang2021Successful; Dai2014Liver).

Alterations in CYP7B1 expression are implicated in the progression of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), where downregulation of the gene is linked to increased hepatic triglycerides and liver damage (Watanabe2023Downregulation; Kakiyama2020Insulin). In prostate cancer, CYP7B1 is overexpressed, and its regulation by promoter methylation may play a role in cancer progression (Olsson2007Regulation). Low expression of CYP7B1 in dentate neurons has also been correlated with Alzheimer's disease progression (Yantsevich2014Human).

## Interactions
CYP7B1, a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, is involved in various metabolic processes, including cholesterol and steroid hormone metabolism. The enzyme interacts with NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, which serves as an electron donor essential for its enzymatic activity (Yantsevich2014Human). This interaction is crucial for the hydroxylation reactions catalyzed by CYP7B1.

The regulation of CYP7B1 expression is influenced by the retinoid-related orphan receptor α (RORα). RORα directly binds to the Cyp7b1 promoter at a specific response element (RORE), activating its transcription. This interaction is specific, as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays (Wada2007Identification). RORα's role in regulating CYP7B1 is further supported by the observation that RORα-deficient mice exhibit decreased expression of Cyp7b1 (Wada2007Identification).

CYP7B1 also interacts with various azole drugs, which inhibit its activity. These interactions are characterized by a type II spectral response, indicating binding within the enzyme's active site (Yantsevich2014Human). These interactions highlight the enzyme's susceptibility to inhibition by pharmaceutical agents, which can impact its metabolic functions.
