# TMEM71

## Overview
TMEM71 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 71, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell signaling and membrane transport. TMEM71 has been studied for its role in several types of cancer, where its expression levels are often altered, suggesting its involvement in tumor progression and metastasis. The protein's function and interactions are of particular interest in the context of glioma, papillary renal cell carcinoma, and Ewing sarcoma, where it may serve as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Wang2019Molecular; Liu2020Identification; CidreAranaz2022Integrative).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
TMEM71 has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In glioma, particularly glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), TMEM71 is overexpressed and associated with higher tumor grades and poorer prognosis. Its expression is linked to chemoresistance to temozolomide, a common chemotherapy drug for glioma, and is enriched in glioma stem cells, suggesting a role in tumor progression and resistance to treatment (Wang2019Molecular).

In papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC), TMEM71 is identified as a methylation-driven gene, where hypermethylation and low expression correlate with poor prognosis. This suggests that TMEM71 may serve as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target in pRCC (Liu2020Identification).

TMEM71 is also involved in the context of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and its central nervous system metastasis. Elevated expression of TMEM71 is associated with reduced survival time in glioma and glioblastoma, and it plays a role in the proliferation and invasion of cancer cells (Li2024Simulating).

In Ewing sarcoma, TMEM71 is downregulated in response to TCF7L1 re-expression, which reduces cellular migration and invasion, indicating its potential involvement in cancer progression and metastasis (CidreAranaz2022Integrative).
