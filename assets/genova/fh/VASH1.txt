# VASH1

## Overview
VASH1 is a gene that encodes the protein vasohibin 1, which is a member of the transglutaminase-like cysteine protease superfamily. Vasohibin 1 is primarily recognized for its role as an angiogenesis inhibitor, functioning predominantly in endothelial cells to regulate vascular homeostasis and inhibit the formation of new blood vessels. The protein is characterized by a unique structure that includes a papain-like fold and a non-canonical catalytic triad, which are essential for its enzymatic activity. Vasohibin 1 forms a complex with the small vasohibin-binding protein (SVBP), which is crucial for its function as a tubulin carboxypeptidase, influencing microtubule dynamics and cell division processes. Clinically, VASH1 expression is associated with various pathological conditions, including tumor progression and vascular diseases, highlighting its significance in both physiological and pathological angiogenesis (Ikeda2020The; Sato2018DoubleFace; Liao2019Molecular).

## Structure
The VASH1 protein is characterized by a primary structure consisting of 364 amino acids, with a core region spanning amino acids 56-310 (Ikeda2020The). Its secondary structure includes an α/β fold with seven α-helices and six β-strands forming a six-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet (Liao2019Molecular). The tertiary structure of VASH1 is described as having a papain-like fold, similar to cysteine proteases, with a non-canonical catalytic triad composed of Cys169, His204, and Leu226, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Liao2019Molecular).

In terms of quaternary structure, VASH1 forms a complex with the small vasohibin-binding protein (SVBP), resulting in a heterodimer or heterotetramer configuration. The heterotetramer is stabilized by the exchange of conserved N-terminal residues, which is important for enzyme activity and regulation (Ikeda2020The). The VASH1-SVBP complex exhibits tubulin tyrosine carboxypeptidase activity, with the complex formation necessary for secretion through a noncanonical pathway (Ikeda2020The).

VASH1 is part of the transglutaminase-like cysteine protease superfamily and contains a conserved vasohibin domain. It may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and has splice variant isoforms that result in different functional forms of the protein (Aillaud2017VasohibinsSVBP).

## Function
Vasohibin-1 (VASH1) is a protein that functions as an angiogenesis inhibitor, primarily active in endothelial cells (ECs). It plays a crucial role in maintaining vascular homeostasis by inhibiting angiogenesis and enhancing stress tolerance in ECs. VASH1 is expressed in ECs of newly formed blood vessels, particularly at sites where angiogenesis should terminate, thereby regulating the cessation of new blood vessel formation (Kimura2009Distinctive; Sato2018DoubleFace).

VASH1 is induced by pro-angiogenic factors such as VEGF and FGF-2, and it inhibits the migration and proliferation of ECs stimulated by these growth factors. This inhibition occurs without affecting VEGF receptor 2 or ERK1/2 phosphorylation, indicating that VASH1's inhibitory effect is not due to the inactivation of growth factor signals (Kimura2009Distinctive).

In addition to its role in angiogenesis, VASH1 enhances the stress resistance of ECs by inducing the expression of superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), which are associated with reducing oxidative stress and improving stress tolerance. This function is significant in preventing premature senescence and maintaining cellular homeostasis, which is crucial for vascular health (Miyashita2012Angiogenesis).

## Clinical Significance
The VASH1 gene has significant clinical implications due to its role in angiogenesis and its expression levels in various diseases. In low-grade glioma (LGG), high VASH1 expression is associated with poor prognosis and tumor progression. It is linked to immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint biomarkers, suggesting a role in modulating tumor immune responses. VASH1 expression is also correlated with tumor mutation burden, further impacting prognosis in LGG (aili2021Comprehensive).

In solid tumors, high VASH1 expression is associated with worse clinical outcomes, including decreased overall survival and disease-free survival. It correlates with aggressive tumor characteristics such as higher TNM stage, lymph node metastasis, and increased microvessel density (Tian2020Clinical).

VASH1 also plays a role in endothelial cell apoptosis and stress resistance. Knockdown of VASH1 leads to increased susceptibility to stress-induced cell death and premature senescence, while overexpression enhances stress resistance. This suggests that alterations in VASH1 expression can impact vascular health and contribute to age-related vascular diseases (Affara2013Vasohibin1; Miyashita2012Angiogenesis).

## Interactions
Vasohibin 1 (VASH1) is known to interact with the small vasohibin-binding protein (SVBP), forming a complex that is crucial for its function as a tubulin carboxypeptidase. This interaction is essential for the detyrosination of α-tubulin, a process that influences microtubule dynamics and is important for mitotic spindle function and chromosome segregation during cell division (Liu2019Structural; Liao2019Molecular). The VASH1-SVBP complex adopts a heterodimeric structure, with SVBP stabilizing VASH1 through extensive intermolecular interactions, including hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions (Liao2019Molecular).

The VASH1-SVBP complex has been crystallized, revealing a non-canonical catalytic triad in VASH1, consisting of Cys169, His204, and Leu226, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (Liao2019Molecular). Mutations in these residues significantly reduce the enzyme's activity, highlighting their importance in substrate binding and catalysis (Liu2019Structural). The interaction between VASH1 and SVBP is also characterized by specific residues in SVBP, such as Ala41, Leu42, and Arg36, which play crucial roles in binding to VASH1 (Liao2019Molecular).

VASH1 also interacts with tubulin, displaying higher activity towards tubulin molecules incorporated into microtubules, suggesting that regions outside the core SVBP-VASH1 heterodimer may be involved in recognizing full-length tubulin in organized microtubules (Liao2019Molecular).
