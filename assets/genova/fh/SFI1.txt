# SFI1

## Overview
The SFI1 gene encodes the SFI1 centrin binding protein, a crucial component in the regulation of centrosome and centriole dynamics. This protein is characterized by its ability to bind centrin, a calcium-binding protein, through a series of conserved internal repeats, facilitating its role in centrosome duplication and organization (Li2006Structural; Kilmartin2003Sfi1p). SFI1 is predominantly α-helical and forms a complex with centrin proteins, which is essential for maintaining centriole architecture and function, particularly during ciliogenesis (Bouhlel2021SFI1; Li2006Structural). The gene is located on chromosome 22 in humans and has been implicated in various neurodevelopmental disorders due to its critical role in cell division and brain development (Kodani2019SFI1; Kilmartin2003Sfi1p). Alterations in SFI1 expression or function can lead to significant clinical outcomes, including microcephaly and autism spectrum disorders, highlighting its importance in human health (Kodani2019SFI1; Trent2014Altered).

## Structure
The SFI1 protein is characterized by a series of internal repeats that are conserved across species, including humans, where it is referred to as hSfi1. These repeats are centrally positioned within the protein and are known for their low proline content (Kilmartin2003Sfi1p). The human SFI1 protein contains a series of 33mer repeats, with some variations in length, such as 35mer and 37mer repeats (Kilmartin2003Sfi1p). These repeats form a filamentous structure that allows the protein to bind multiple centrin molecules, which are crucial for its function in centrosome duplication (Li2006Structural).

The secondary structure of SFI1 is predominantly α-helical, with centrins wrapping around the long α-helix of SFI1, forming a helical arrangement (Bombardi2022Conformational; Li2006Structural). The tertiary structure involves the interaction of centrin molecules with the SFI1 repeats, where the N-terminal domains of centrins bind to the N-terminal half of the SFI1 repeat, and the C-terminal domains bind to the more conserved C-terminal half (Li2006Structural).

SFI1 has two known isoforms in humans, one with 968 amino acids and another with 1242 amino acids, with the latter being more commonly used in experimental studies (Kilmartin2003Sfi1p). The protein is located on chromosome 22 in humans (Kilmartin2003Sfi1p).

## Function
SFI1 is a crucial protein involved in centriole duplication and centrosome organization in healthy human cells. It localizes to the centrosome during the S phase of the cell cycle, where it plays a key role in recruiting the deubiquitylating enzyme USP9X. This recruitment is essential for the stabilization of the microcephaly protein STIL, which is critical for centriole duplication. By stabilizing STIL, SFI1 ensures proper centriole duplication, a process vital for cell division and brain development (Kodani2019SFI1).

SFI1 also forms a complex with centrin proteins at the distal end of centrioles, which is important for maintaining centriole architecture and function. This complex is involved in ciliogenesis, a process necessary for cell signaling and movement. Depletion of SFI1 leads to defects in ciliogenesis and structural abnormalities in centrioles, indicating its role in maintaining centriole integrity (Bouhlel2021SFI1).

In summary, SFI1 is integral to centriole duplication and architecture, contributing to the structural organization of centrosomes and the proper functioning of cilia, thereby playing a significant role in cell division and development (Kodani2019SFI1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the SFI1 gene have been implicated in several neurodevelopmental disorders. Disruptions in SFI1 function can lead to defects in centriole duplication, which is crucial for proper cell division and brain development. This has been associated with conditions such as microcephaly, characterized by a smaller head and brain size, due to the destabilization of the microcephaly protein STIL (Kodani2019SFI1). 

Altered expression of SFI1 has also been linked to autism and related developmental disorders. Copy number variants encompassing SFI1 have been identified in these conditions, suggesting a potential role in their pathogenesis (Trent2014Altered). 

In the context of traumatic brain injury (TBI), the expression of SFI1 decreases with increasing severity of the injury. This decrease is associated with changes in DNA methylation patterns and is correlated with the Glasgow Coma Scale score, indicating its potential involvement in the response to brain injury (Zheng2022DNA). 

These findings highlight the clinical significance of SFI1 in various neurological and developmental conditions, emphasizing the importance of its normal function and regulation.

## Interactions
The human SFI1 protein is known for its critical interactions with centrin proteins, particularly centrin 2 and centrin 3, forming a complex at the distal end of centrioles. This interaction is essential for maintaining proper centriole architecture and is crucial for ciliogenesis. The SFI1/centrin complex is recruited at the onset of centriole biogenesis, indicating its importance in the early stages of centriole formation (Bouhlel2021SFI1).

SFI1 is responsible for the localization of centrin at the distal end of centrioles. Depletion of SFI1 results in a significant reduction of centrin at this location, while the central core region remains unaffected. This suggests that SFI1 forms a specific complex with centrin at the distal end, distinct from other centrin complexes in the centriole (Bouhlel2021SFI1).

In yeast, SFI1p, the yeast homolog of human SFI1, binds directly to multiple molecules of the centrin protein Cdc31p through conserved centrin-binding sites. This interaction is crucial for spindle pole body duplication, highlighting the conserved nature of the SFI1-centrin interaction across species (Kilmartin2003Sfi1p).
