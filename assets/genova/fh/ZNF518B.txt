# ZNF518B

## Overview
ZNF518B is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 518B, which is involved in transcriptional regulation through its interactions with histone methyltransferases. As a zinc finger protein, ZNF518B is characterized by its ability to bind DNA and influence gene expression by modifying chromatin structure. It plays a significant role in epigenetic regulation by recruiting enzymes such as G9A and EZH2 to specific genomic loci, thereby contributing to the addition of repressive histone marks like H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 (GimenoValiente2021Epigenetic). This gene is particularly implicated in colorectal cancer, where its up-regulation is associated with increased tumor cell migration and invasiveness, suggesting a role in cancer progression and metastasis (GimenoValiente2019ZNF518B). The differential expression of ZNF518B isoforms has potential clinical significance, serving as a biomarker for disease-free survival in colorectal cancer patients (GimenoValiente2021Epigenetic).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF518B is implicated in colorectal cancer (CRC) through its up-regulation, which promotes tumor cell dissemination. The gene's expression is regulated by epigenetic mechanisms, including histone modifications and chromatin structure, which influence its transcriptional activity (GimenoValiente2019ZNF518B). Overexpression of ZNF518B in CRC tissues is associated with increased cell migration and invasiveness, suggesting its role in cancer progression and metastasis (GimenoValiente2019ZNF518B). The gene interacts with histone methyltransferases EZH2 and G9A, contributing to oncogenic processes by repressing tumor suppressor genes through epigenetic modifications (GimenoValiente2021Epigenetic).

The ratio of ZNF518B isoform 2 to isoform 1 is significantly associated with disease-free survival in CRC patients, indicating its potential as a biomarker for CRC recurrence (GimenoValiente2021Epigenetic). This ratio does not correlate with tumor invasiveness, suggesting that ZNF518B isoform expression may not directly affect CRC cell dissemination (GimenoValiente2021Epigenetic). The gene's involvement in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) further implicates it in cancer cell dissemination (GimenoValiente2019ZNF518B). ZNF518B's role in CRC highlights its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention, particularly through epigenetic drug strategies (GimenoValiente2019ZNF518B).

## Interactions
ZNF518B is known to interact with several proteins, particularly histone methyltransferases, which play a role in epigenetic regulation. It physically interacts with G9A and EZH2, two enzymes involved in the addition of repressive histone marks, H3K9me2 and H3K27me3, respectively. These interactions suggest that ZNF518B may recruit these methyltransferases to specific genomic loci, influencing gene expression by modifying chromatin structure (GimenoValiente2021Epigenetic).

The recruitment of EZH2 by ZNF518B has been observed in genes such as KAT2B, RGS4, and EFNA5, leading to changes in H3K27me3 levels, which are associated with gene repression. This interaction is significant in colorectal cancer, as it may contribute to the metastatic phenotype by silencing tumor suppressor genes (GimenoValiente2021Epigenetic). Silencing ZNF518B results in reduced binding of EZH2 and the disappearance of the H3K27me3 mark in several genomic regions, indicating its role in recruiting these methyltransferases (GimenoValiente2021Epigenetic).

ZNF518B also interacts with type I collagen fibers, which may influence cell migration and invasiveness, further implicating it in cancer progression (GimenoValiente2019ZNF518B). These interactions highlight ZNF518B's potential role in transcriptional regulation and its contribution to oncogenic processes in colorectal cancer.
