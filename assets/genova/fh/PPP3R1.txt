# PPP3R1

## Overview
The PPP3R1 gene encodes the protein phosphatase 3 regulatory subunit B, alpha, which is a critical component of the calcineurin complex, a calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase. This protein functions as a regulatory subunit, playing a pivotal role in calcium signaling pathways by forming a heterodimer with the catalytic subunit of calcineurin, thereby facilitating its activation. The calcineurin complex is involved in various cellular processes, including immune response regulation, cardiac muscle function, and cellular senescence. The protein encoded by PPP3R1 is essential for the dephosphorylation and activation of transcription factors such as NFAT, which are crucial for gene expression in immune cells (Rusnak2000Calcineurin:; Li2023PPP3R1). Additionally, PPP3R1 is implicated in the regulation of left ventricular mass and has been associated with myocardial hypertrophy, highlighting its significance in cardiac physiology (Gorący2023Association). The gene's expression and function are subject to regulation by various factors, including miRNAs, which can modulate its role in both normal physiology and disease states (Ágg2018MicroRNA).

## Structure
The PPP3R1 gene encodes the regulatory subunit B, alpha of calcineurin, a protein phosphatase involved in calcium signaling. The protein's structure includes a primary sequence of amino acids that form a complex with the catalytic subunit of calcineurin, known as CnA. This interaction is crucial for the phosphatase's function, as CnB (the protein product of PPP3R1) binds to CnA, facilitating its activation in response to calcium signals (Yang2017The).

The tertiary structure of PPP3R1 involves its role as a regulatory subunit, which is essential for the full activation of calcineurin. This activation is dependent on calcium binding, which induces a conformational change that displaces the autoinhibitory domain of CnA, allowing the phosphatase to become active (Yang2017The). The quaternary structure of calcineurin includes the formation of a heterodimer between the catalytic subunit (CnA) and the regulatory subunit (CnB), highlighting the importance of PPP3R1 in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the enzyme complex (Yang2017The).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may also play a role in the regulation of PPP3R1, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context. The protein's structure and interactions are critical for its role in calcium-dependent signaling pathways.

## Function
The PPP3R1 gene encodes the regulatory subunit B, alpha of calcineurin, a calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase. Calcineurin plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including T-cell activation, where it dephosphorylates the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), facilitating its translocation into the nucleus. This process is essential for the regulation of immune responses (Rusnak2000Calcineurin:).

In mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), PPP3R1 is involved in cellular senescence. It promotes plasma membrane depolarization and increases calcium (Ca2+) influx, which activates the NFAT/ATF3/p53 signaling pathway. This cascade accelerates MSC aging, affecting their differentiation potential into bone and adipocyte lineages (Li2023PPP3R1). The gene's expression increases with age in bone marrow stromal cells, leading to proliferation arrest and altered differentiation (Li2023PPP3R1).

PPP3R1 also plays a role in cardiac muscle function by regulating left ventricular mass. The gene's polymorphisms have been associated with variations in left ventricular mass, suggesting its involvement in myocardial hypertrophy and cardiac hypertrophic remodeling (Gorący2023Association). These functions highlight the gene's importance in both cellular and organismal physiology.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the PPP3R1 gene, which encodes the regulatory subunit of calcineurin, have been implicated in several diseases. In psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory skin condition, miR-548a-3p is upregulated and targets PPP3R1, leading to decreased expression of the gene. This interaction promotes keratinocyte proliferation, contributing to the pathogenesis of psoriasis (Zhao2017MiR548a3p).

In the context of cardiac health, a 5-base pair deletion polymorphism in the promoter region of PPP3R1 is associated with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). This polymorphism may increase calcineurin activity, contributing to excessive cardiac muscle growth, particularly in individuals with severe hypertension (Tang2005Identification).

PPP3R1 is also involved in the aging process of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Increased expression of PPP3R1 in older age groups is linked to enhanced cellular senescence, affecting the differentiation potential of MSCs and contributing to age-related diseases (Li2023PPP3R1).

In hypercholesterolemia, PPP3R1 protein levels are downregulated, potentially due to miRNA interactions, which may contribute to cardiac dysfunction (Ágg2018MicroRNA). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PPP3R1 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
PPP3R1, also known as calcineurin B, is a regulatory subunit of the protein phosphatase calcineurin, which plays a crucial role in calcium-dependent signal transduction. It forms a complex with the catalytic subunit PPP3CB, facilitating the dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of transcription factors such as NFAT, which is essential for gene expression regulation in immune responses (Li2023PPP3R1). 

PPP3R1 interacts with TFEB, a transcription factor involved in lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy. This interaction is dependent on PPP3CB, as suppression of PPP3CB abolishes the association between PPP3R1 and TFEB. Overexpression of PPP3CB enhances this interaction, indicating a regulatory role of PPP3R1 in TFEB activation (Dong2022Smurf1).

In the context of hypercholesterolemia, PPP3R1 is targeted by multiple miRNAs, particularly from the miR-30 family, which are upregulated and potentially contribute to the downregulation of its protein product, CNB1, without affecting mRNA levels (Ágg2018MicroRNA). This highlights the complex regulatory interactions involving PPP3R1 and miRNAs, which can significantly impact gene expression and protein function in various physiological and pathological conditions.
