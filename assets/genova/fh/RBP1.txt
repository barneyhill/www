# RBP1

## Overview
Retinol binding protein 1 (RBP1) is a gene that encodes the cellular retinol-binding protein type 1 (CRBP1), a cytoplasmic protein crucial for the intracellular transport and metabolism of retinol, a form of vitamin A. CRBP1 is categorized as a binding protein and plays a pivotal role in maintaining retinoid homeostasis by facilitating the conversion of retinol to its biologically active form, all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA), which is essential for regulating gene expression and supporting cellular differentiation and growth (Napoli2017Cellular). The protein's interactions with various enzymes and its involvement in transcriptional repression through associations with retinoblastoma (RB) family proteins highlight its significance in cell cycle regulation and potential implications in cancer development (Lai1999RBP1). Additionally, alterations in RBP1 expression have been linked to clinical conditions such as coronary artery disease and various cancers, underscoring its importance as a potential therapeutic target (Wang2023Coronary).

## Function
The RBP1 gene encodes the cellular retinol-binding protein type 1 (CRBP1), which plays a critical role in the intracellular transport and metabolism of retinol (vitamin A) in human cells. CRBP1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it binds retinol with high affinity, facilitating its delivery to specific enzymes and receptors involved in retinoid metabolism (Napoli2017Cellular). This protein is essential for the conversion of retinol to all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA), a biologically active form of vitamin A that regulates gene expression and is crucial for various physiological processes, including cellular differentiation and growth (Napoli2017Cellular).

CRBP1 interacts with enzymes such as lecithin:retinol acyltransferase (LRAT) to convert retinol into retinyl esters for storage, and with retinol dehydrogenases for the conversion of retinol into retinal, which is further oxidized to atRA (Napoli2020Retinoid; Zalesak‐Kravec2022Role). The protein's ability to sequester retinol ensures its protection from non-specific oxidation and regulates its availability for metabolic processes (Zalesak‐Kravec2022Role). CRBP1's function is vital for maintaining retinoid homeostasis, which is necessary for normal cellular function and organismal health (Napoli2017Cellular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the RBP1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in coronary artery disease (CAD) and various cancers. RBP1 is highly expressed in CAD and is associated with immune cell infiltration, suggesting its role in the disease's immunological aspects (Wang2023Coronary). In cancer, RBP1 is linked to poor prognosis and is often silenced in malignant tumors. Its expression is associated with processes like self-renewal, invasion, and migration, especially in non-glioblastoma diffuse glioma (Wang2023Coronary). RBP1 mutations, predominantly amplifications, are linked to worse outcomes in tumors (Wang2023Coronary).

RBP1 is also involved in transcriptional repression through interactions with retinoblastoma (RB) family proteins, affecting cell cycle regulation and potentially contributing to cancer development (Lai1999RBP1). Its role in osteoblastic differentiation highlights its importance in bone development, with suppression leading to delayed mineralization and reduced expression of bone marker genes (Monroe2010Retinoblastoma). These findings underscore the gene's potential as a therapeutic target in both cardiovascular and cancer-related conditions.

## Interactions
RBP1 (retinol binding protein 1) is involved in several protein interactions, particularly in the context of transcriptional repression and cell cycle regulation. RBP1 interacts with retinoblastoma (RB) family proteins, such as pRB, p107, and p130, through an LXCXE motif, which is crucial for recruiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) to these proteins. This interaction facilitates the binding of HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3, with a stronger association observed with HDAC1, contributing to the repression of E2F-dependent transcription (Lai1999RBP1).

RBP1 also acts as a bridging factor to recruit the mSIN3-HDAC complex to the RB family proteins, a process that is pocket-dependent and involves the SAP30 subunit. This recruitment is essential for transcriptional repression during cell cycle arrest (Lai2001RBP1). The R2 domain of RBP1 is necessary for its interaction with SIRT1, a class III histone deacetylase, which negatively regulates the HDAC1-dependent transcriptional repression mediated by RBP1 (Binda2008SIRT1).

RBP1 also interacts with the breast cancer metastasis suppressor 1 (BRMS1) in mSIN3/HDAC-containing complexes, although BRMS1 does not co-immunoprecipitate with RB or p107, suggesting a distinct complex formation (Meehan2004Breast).
