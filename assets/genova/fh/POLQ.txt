# POLQ

## Overview
POLQ is a gene that encodes DNA polymerase theta, a specialized enzyme belonging to the A-family of DNA polymerases. This enzyme is characterized by its low fidelity and lack of proofreading activity, which allows it to perform unique functions in DNA repair processes, particularly in microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) and translesion synthesis (TLS) (Hogg2011Promiscuous; Arana2008Lowfidelity). DNA polymerase theta is distinguished by its multifunctional domain structure, including an N-terminal helicase-like domain, a central spacer domain, and a C-terminal polymerase domain, which collectively facilitate its role in maintaining genomic stability under conditions of replicative stress (Hogg2011Promiscuous; Arana2008Lowfidelity). The enzyme's activity is crucial in contexts where other DNA repair pathways, such as homologous recombination, are compromised, making it a significant factor in cellular responses to DNA damage (Kruchinin2023Multifaceted). Overexpression of POLQ has been linked to poor prognosis in various cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Schrempf2021Targeting; Lemée2010DNA).

## Structure
DNA polymerase theta (POLQ) is a multifunctional enzyme characterized by a unique domain structure. It comprises an N-terminal helicase-like domain, a central spacer domain, and a C-terminal polymerase domain. The helicase-like domain contains motifs typical of DNA and RNA helicases, although no helicase activity has been reported (Arana2008Lowfidelity). The polymerase domain is part of the A-family of DNA polymerases but exhibits low fidelity similar to Y-family polymerases, allowing it to perform translesion synthesis and bypass DNA lesions (Hogg2011Promiscuous).

POLQ's structure includes specific protein loops, particularly Inserts 1 and 2, which are crucial for its enzymatic activities. These loops are thought to stabilize misaligned intermediates, contributing to the enzyme's high error rates, especially for single base insertions and deletions (Arana2008Lowfidelity). The enzyme's ability to extend single-stranded DNA and perform template-independent synthesis is attributed to these structural features (Hogg2011Promiscuous).

POLQ may operate as a dimer or multimer during microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ), although this has not been confirmed in vivo (Beagan2015Linking). The enzyme's activity is influenced by its structural components, which facilitate its roles in DNA repair and genome stability.

## Function
DNA polymerase theta (POLQ) is a specialized enzyme involved in several critical DNA repair processes in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) through the microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) pathway, also known as theta-mediated end joining (TMEJ). This pathway is particularly important when other repair mechanisms, such as homologous recombination (HR) and classical non-homologous end joining (c-NHEJ), are compromised (Malaby2017Expression; Kruchinin2023Multifaceted).

POLQ is characterized by its low fidelity and lack of proofreading activity, which results in a relatively high error rate during DNA synthesis. Despite this, it is crucial for maintaining genomic stability by preventing large chromosomal rearrangements and facilitating the repair of DSBs, especially under conditions of replicative stress (Kruchinin2023Multifaceted; Arana2008Lowfidelity). POLQ is also involved in translesion synthesis (TLS), allowing it to bypass certain DNA lesions, such as abasic sites and thymine glycol, which are typically challenging for other DNA polymerases (Wood2016DNA; Yousefzadeh2013DNA).

In the cellular context, POLQ is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the repair of DNA damage and influences cell survival and genomic integrity (Brambati2020DNA). Its activity is essential for cellular responses to DNA damage, particularly in situations where other repair pathways are deficient (Kruchinin2023Multifaceted).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the POLQ gene, which encodes DNA polymerase theta, have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. Overexpression of POLQ is associated with poor prognosis in several cancers, including breast and ovarian cancer. In breast cancer, POLQ overexpression correlates with increased chromosomal instability, reduced DNA replication fork speed, and activation of the DNA damage response, leading to poor survival outcomes (Lemée2010DNA). This overexpression is particularly notable in triple-negative breast cancer, a subtype with typically worse outcomes (Lemée2010DNA).

In cancer cells, POLQ upregulation provides a proliferative advantage by allowing tolerance to increased replication stress, which enhances tumor fitness. This is particularly relevant in cancers with homologous recombination (HR) deficiencies, such as those with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, where POLQ-mediated repair becomes crucial for maintaining genome stability (Schrempf2021Targeting). POLQ's role in theta-mediated end joining (TMEJ) is essential for the survival of HR-deficient cancer cells, making it a potential target for synthetic lethality-based therapies (Feng2019Genetic).

The gene's involvement in alternative end-joining pathways and its upregulation in response to DNA damage highlight its potential as a therapeutic target, particularly in cancers reliant on POLQ for DNA repair (Wood2016DNA).

## Interactions
DNA polymerase theta (POLQ) interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in DNA repair processes. POLQ is involved in theta-mediated end joining (TMEJ) and interacts with proteins such as RAD51, BRCA1, and BRCA2. It counteracts RAD51, a protein involved in homologous recombination, by promoting the dissociation of RAD51-mediated D-loops and suppressing homologous recombination, which is crucial in maintaining genomic stability in BRCA-deficient cells (Ronson2023Mechanisms; Ozdemir2018Polymerase).

POLQ also interacts with replication protein A (RPA), where its helicase domain counteracts RPA to promote alternative non-homologous end joining (alt-NHEJ) (Ronson2023Mechanisms; Brambati2020DNA). The enzyme's helicase domain facilitates DNA unwinding and annealing, which is essential for microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) (Brambati2020DNA; Ozdemir2018Polymerase).

In addition, POLQ interacts with the origin replication complex protein ORC1, suggesting a role in rescuing stalled replication forks (Wood2016DNA). It also has a potential interaction with poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), particularly PARP1, in the altEJ pathway, although the exact relationship remains unresolved (Wood2016DNA). These interactions highlight POLQ's multifaceted role in DNA repair and replication.
