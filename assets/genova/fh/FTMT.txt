# FTMT

## Overview
The FTMT gene encodes mitochondrial ferritin, a specialized protein involved in iron storage within the mitochondria. Mitochondrial ferritin is categorized as an iron-storage protein and is distinct from other ferritins due to its localization and function within the mitochondria. The protein is crucial for maintaining iron homeostasis and protecting cells from oxidative stress by sequestering excess iron and preventing its participation in harmful chemical reactions. This function is particularly important in cells with high metabolic rates, such as those in the brain and testis. The FTMT gene is intronless, and its expression leads to a redistribution of iron from the cytosol to the mitochondria, impacting cellular iron balance and supporting the synthesis of mitochondrial enzymes and iron-sulfur clusters. The protective role of mitochondrial ferritin is underscored by its involvement in various physiological processes and its potential implications in diseases related to oxidative stress and iron dysregulation (Levi2021Mitochondrial; Wu2019Mitochondrial; Campanella2008Mitochondrial).

## Structure
The FTMT gene encodes mitochondrial ferritin, a protein involved in iron storage within mitochondria. The primary structure of mitochondrial ferritin consists of 242 amino acids, including an N-terminal extension of 50-60 residues that facilitates mitochondrial targeting (Levi2021Mitochondrial; Arosio2010Cytosolic). This N-terminal sequence is characterized by regularly spaced positive charges, aiding its import into mitochondria (Drysdale2002Mitochondrial).

The secondary structure of mitochondrial ferritin includes a 4-helical bundle, which is a common feature in ferritins and is crucial for its function (Arosio2010Cytosolic). The tertiary structure of the protein is highly conserved and similar to that of H-ferritin, with a di-iron binding site embedded within the helical bundle, which is responsible for its ferroxidase activity (Levi2021Mitochondrial; Arosio2010Cytosolic).

In terms of quaternary structure, mitochondrial ferritin assembles into a 24-subunit homopolymer within the mitochondrial matrix, forming ferritin shells that are similar to those of cytosolic ferritins (Drysdale2002Mitochondrial; Levi2021Mitochondrial). This assembly is crucial for its role in iron storage and detoxification. The protein does not undergo alternative splicing, as it is encoded by an intronless gene (Levi2001A).

## Function
Mitochondrial ferritin (FtMt), encoded by the FTMT gene, is a protein that plays a crucial role in iron storage and detoxification within mitochondria. It is primarily active in cells with high metabolic activity and oxygen consumption, such as those in the brain and testis (Levi2021Mitochondrial; Gao2014Mitochondrial). FtMt sequesters excess iron in its spherical shells, preventing it from participating in Fenton chemistry, which can produce highly toxic hydroxyl radicals and increase oxidative stress (Wu2019Mitochondrial). This function is vital for protecting mitochondria from iron-induced oxidative damage, maintaining cellular health, and supporting energy production (Levi2021Mitochondrial; Gao2014Mitochondrial).

FtMt expression leads to the redistribution of iron from the cytosol to mitochondria, reducing cytosolic iron availability and affecting overall cellular iron homeostasis (Levi2021Mitochondrial; Corsi2002Human). This redistribution is crucial for the synthesis of mitochondrial enzymes and the regulation of iron-sulfur clusters, which are essential for various cellular processes (Campanella2008Mitochondrial). FtMt's ability to mitigate oxidative damage and maintain iron homeostasis highlights its protective role in cells, particularly under conditions of oxidative stress (Campanella2008Mitochondrial; Wu2019Mitochondrial).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the FTMT gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly those involving oxidative stress and iron homeostasis. In age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a mutation in the FTMT gene has been linked to the disease, suggesting a role in modulating angiogenic factors and oxidative stress management in retinal cells (Stenirri2012Study; Buyandelger2020Effects). In Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), FTMT expression is beneficial as it reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and protects iron-sulfur enzyme activities, potentially compensating for frataxin deficiency (Levi2021Mitochondrial; Campanella2008Mitochondrial).

In neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, increased FTMT expression is observed in affected neurons, where it appears to have a neuroprotective role by reducing oxidative damage and modulating iron metabolism (Guan2017Mitochondrial; Wu2019Mitochondrial). In Parkinson's disease, FTMT helps regulate α-synuclein expression, a key factor in the disease's pathology (Guan2017Mitochondrial). In Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS), increased FTMT expression is associated with altered iron homeostasis, which may contribute to the condition's pathology (Levi2021Mitochondrial). These findings suggest that FTMT plays a significant role in various diseases by modulating iron metabolism and oxidative stress.
