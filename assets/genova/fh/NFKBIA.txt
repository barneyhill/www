# NFKBIA

## Overview
The NFKBIA gene encodes the IκBα protein, a pivotal inhibitor within the NF-κB signaling pathway, which plays a crucial role in regulating immune and inflammatory responses. IκBα is categorized as an inhibitory protein that functions by binding to the NF-κB transcription factor complex, specifically the p50-p65 heterodimer, and sequestering it in the cytoplasm. This sequestration prevents NF-κB from translocating to the nucleus and activating genes involved in inflammation and immune responses (Karin2000Phosphorylation; Ali2010Functional). The regulation of NF-κB activity by IκBα is modulated through phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which signal IκBα for degradation, thereby allowing NF-κB to enter the nucleus (DiDonato1997A). The NFKBIA gene itself is subject to feedback regulation by NF-κB, ensuring a tightly controlled balance of immune signaling (Arenzana-Seisdedos1995Inducible). Mutations in NFKBIA are linked to various clinical conditions, including immunodeficiencies and certain cancers, highlighting its significance in maintaining immune homeostasis (Boisson2017Human; Lake2009Mutations).

## Structure
The NFKBIA gene encodes the IκBα protein, which functions as an inhibitor of the NF-κB transcription factor. The primary structure of IκBα is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat domains. These domains are essential for the protein's ability to bind NF-κB, thereby inhibiting its activity. The secondary structure of IκBα includes alpha helices within these ankyrin repeats, contributing to the protein's stability and function.

In terms of tertiary structure, the ankyrin repeats fold to form a stable inhibitory complex that effectively sequesters NF-κB in the cytoplasm, preventing its translocation to the nucleus where it would activate target genes. This folding is crucial for the protein's inhibitory function.

Post-translational modifications play a significant role in regulating the function and degradation of IκBα. Phosphorylation and ubiquitination are key modifications that signal the protein for degradation, thus modulating the NF-κB signaling pathway. These modifications ensure that the inhibition of NF-κB is tightly controlled and can be rapidly reversed in response to cellular signals. 

The structural features of IκBα, including its ankyrin repeat domains and post-translational modifications, are critical for its role in regulating NF-κB activity.

## Function
The NFKBIA gene encodes the IκBα protein, a crucial regulator of the NF-κB signaling pathway in human cells. IκBα functions by binding to the NF-κB transcription factor, specifically the p50-p65 heterodimer, and sequestering it in the cytoplasm. This interaction prevents NF-κB from translocating to the nucleus, thereby inhibiting the transcription of proinflammatory genes (Karin2000Phosphorylation; Ali2010Functional). 

Upon cellular stimulation by factors such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or interleukin 1 (IL-1), IκBα is phosphorylated by the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, leading to its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. This degradation releases NF-κB, allowing it to enter the nucleus and activate the transcription of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses (Ali2010Functional; DiDonato1997A). 

The NFKBIA gene itself is a target of NF-κB, creating a feedback loop where newly synthesized IκBα can re-enter the nucleus, bind NF-κB, and facilitate its export back to the cytoplasm, thus terminating the signal (Karin2000Phosphorylation; Arenzana-Seisdedos1995Inducible). This regulatory mechanism is essential for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive inflammation (Ali2010Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NFKBIA gene, which encodes the IκBα protein, are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily involving immune system dysfunction. One significant condition is anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immunodeficiency (EDA-ID), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by impaired NF-κB-mediated responses due to gain-of-function mutations in NFKBIA. These mutations enhance the inhibitory activity of IκBα, preventing its phosphorylation and degradation, leading to severe immunodeficiency with symptoms such as B-cell deficiency and recurrent infections (Boisson2017Human; Yoshioka2013Autosomal).

Specific mutations, such as p.Ser32Cys and p.Ser36Tyr, have been identified in patients with EDA-ID, affecting phosphorylation sites crucial for IκBα degradation and NF-κB activation. These mutations result in varied clinical phenotypes, including ectodermal dysplasia, systemic inflammation, and immunodeficiency (Chear2022A; Yoshioka2013Autosomal). The p.Ser36Tyr mutation, for instance, is associated with milder ectodermal dysplasia and fewer infections (Yoshioka2013Autosomal).

NFKBIA mutations are also implicated in classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), where they contribute to the pathogenesis by affecting NF-κB signaling pathways, although they are not a unifying feature in non-EBV-associated cases (Lake2009Mutations).

## Interactions
NFKBIA, also known as IκBα, is a critical inhibitor of the NF-κB transcription factor complex. It physically interacts with NF-κB subunits, such as p65/RelA, c-Rel, and p50, sequestering them in the cytoplasm and preventing their nuclear translocation and subsequent activation of gene transcription (Curran2002Polymorphic). This interaction is crucial for regulating immune and inflammatory responses, as well as cell proliferation and apoptosis (Song2020Silencing).

NFKBIA is involved in a regulatory loop where its transcription is activated by NF-κB, creating a feedback mechanism that controls NF-κB activity (Paciolla2011Nuclear). The protein's interaction with NF-κB is modulated by phosphorylation, which marks NFKBIA for degradation, thereby releasing NF-κB to enter the nucleus (Curran2002Polymorphic).

In addition to its role in the NF-κB pathway, NFKBIA interacts with β-catenin, a key player in cell signaling and cancer progression. This interaction inhibits β-catenin-mediated signaling, affecting processes such as cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in cervical cancer cells (Chen2021Study). These interactions highlight NFKBIA's multifaceted role in cellular signaling pathways.
