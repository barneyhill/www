# CCDC28B

## Overview
CCDC28B is a gene that encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 28B protein, which is integral to various cellular processes, particularly ciliogenesis and immune synapse assembly. The protein is characterized by a coiled-coil domain that facilitates protein-protein interactions, playing a pivotal role in regulating cilia length and function. It interacts with motor proteins such as kinesin 1 and is involved in the regulation of the mTORC2 complex, although its role in cilia length regulation is independent of mTORC2. CCDC28B also contains functional motifs like a nuclear localization signal, suggesting additional roles in cellular signaling and transport. Clinically, mutations in CCDC28B have been linked to Bardet-Biedl Syndrome and Common Variable Immunodeficiency, where it acts as a genetic modifier and affects immune cell function, respectively (Novas2018Kinesin; Capitani2020A; CardenasRodriguez2012Characterization).

## Structure
The CCDC28B protein is a 200-amino acid protein characterized by a coiled coil domain located in the C-terminal region between residues Glu158 and Glu193. This domain is typically involved in protein oligomerization and heterologous protein-protein interactions (CardenasRodriguez2012Characterization). The N-terminal region, comprising the first 75-80 amino acids, is predicted to be disordered (CardenasRodriguez2012Characterization). The protein contains several functional domains, including a calmodulin binding IQ motif between residues D101 and E120, a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) docking motif between K128 and V138, a nuclear localization signal (NLS) at the N-terminal, and two nuclear export signals (NES) centered on F134 and D178 (CardenasRodriguez2012Characterization).

CCDC28B is highly conserved across species, particularly in vertebrates, and shares a high level of conservation with its paralog CCDC28A (CardenasRodriguez2012Characterization). The protein is enriched in motifs common in centrosomes and cilia, which are often found in proteins with both coiled coil motifs and intrinsically disordered regions (CardenasRodriguez2012Characterization). The protein's interaction with SIN1 suggests a role in regulating cilia length, independent of the mTORC2 complex (CardenasRodriguez2013The).

## Function
The CCDC28B gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in ciliogenesis, the process of cilia formation, which is essential for various cellular functions, including signal processing and sensory activities. The protein is characterized by a coiled coil domain that facilitates protein-protein interactions, and it is involved in regulating cilia length through its interaction with kinesin 1, a motor protein complex. This interaction is significant for maintaining normal cilia length, as CCDC28B acts in opposition to kinesin 1 in this regulatory pathway (Novas2018Kinesin).

CCDC28B is also implicated in the regulation of the mTORC2 complex, where it acts as a positive regulator, influencing the assembly and stability of the complex. This regulation is crucial for cilia formation and maintenance, although CCDC28B's role in cilia length regulation appears to be independent of mTORC2 (CardenasRodriguez2013The).

In addition to its role in ciliogenesis, CCDC28B contains several functional motifs, including a nuclear localization signal (NLS), which is essential for its nuclear translocation and function. This suggests that CCDC28B may also have roles in cellular signaling and transport (Novas2018Kinesin; CardenasRodriguez2012Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CCDC28B gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions, most notably Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS) and Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID). CCDC28B acts as a second site modifier in BBS, a ciliopathy characterized by symptoms such as retinal degeneration, obesity, and renal malformations. Mutations in CCDC28B, when combined with mutations in other BBS-related genes, can exacerbate the severity of BBS symptoms (CardenasRodriguez2013The; Novas2018Kinesin). The gene's interaction with proteins like SIN1 and kinesin 1 is crucial for cilia length regulation, and its depletion can lead to abnormal cilia morphology, contributing to the pathogenesis of BBS (Novas2018Kinesin).

In the context of CVID, a specific variant of CCDC28B, R25W, disrupts immune synapse assembly by impairing the recruitment of the WASH/FAM21 complex to the retromer, which is essential for T-cell receptor recycling and actin polymerization. This disruption leads to defects in immune cell function, highlighting the gene's role in immune responses (Capitani2020A). The presence of CCDC28B mutations in CVID patients suggests a potential role for this gene in primary immunodeficiencies (Capitani2020A).

## Interactions
CCDC28B is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in ciliogenesis and immune synapse assembly. It interacts with the kinesin 1 motor complex, specifically with kinesin light chain 1 (KLC1) and the heavy chain KIF5B. This interaction is significant for regulating cilia length, as depletion of these kinesin components results in elongated cilia (Novas2018Kinesin). CCDC28B also interacts with Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS) proteins, such as BBS4, which is localized at the pericentriolar region and is essential for the formation of the BBSome complex involved in cilia function (Novas2018Kinesin).

In the context of immune synapse assembly, CCDC28B interacts with the WASH complex component FAM21, facilitating the recruitment of WASH to retromer-associated T-cell receptors (TCRs) at early endosomes. This interaction is crucial for actin polymerization and TCR recycling (Capitani2020A). The R25W variant of CCDC28B disrupts this interaction, impairing immune synapse assembly by affecting the synaptic accumulation of TCRs and phosphoproteins (Capitani2020A). CCDC28B also forms a complex with the retromer component VPS35 and actin regulators, indicating its role in TCR trafficking and immune synapse assembly (Capitani2020A).
