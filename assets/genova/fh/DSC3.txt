# DSC3

## Overview
DSC3 is a gene that encodes the protein desmocollin 3, a member of the cadherin superfamily, which is integral to the structure and function of desmosomes. Desmocollin 3 is a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in mediating cell-cell adhesion within epithelial tissues, contributing to the mechanical strength and integrity of these tissues (Shukla2020DESMOCOLLIN; Franke2009Discovering). The protein is primarily expressed in the basal and first suprabasal layers of the skin, where it is involved in processes such as tissue morphogenesis and homeostasis (Lotti2019Development). DSC3 is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that may have distinct functional roles (Legan1994The). The gene's expression is regulated by factors such as the tumor suppressor protein p53, highlighting its potential involvement in cellular stress responses and tumor suppression (Shukla2020DESMOCOLLIN). Alterations in DSC3 have been implicated in various clinical conditions, including certain skin disorders and cancers, where its expression is often downregulated, affecting cell adhesion and signaling pathways (Cui2011DSC3; Oshiro2005Epigenetic).

## Structure
Desmocollin 3 (DSC3) is a protein that is part of the cadherin superfamily, which plays a crucial role in cell-cell adhesion within desmosomes. The primary structure of DSC3 includes a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, but specific details on this sequence are not provided in the available context. The secondary structure likely involves typical cadherin features such as alpha helices and beta sheets, although specific details are not mentioned.

DSC3 contains extracellular cadherin domains, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail, which are characteristic of cadherin proteins (Franke2009Discovering). The cytoplasmic domain of DSC3 shows size heterogeneity due to alternative mRNA splicing, resulting in different splice variant isoforms, such as the 'a' and 'b' forms, which differ in the length of their cytoplasmic domains (Legan1994The). The 'a' form is longer than the 'b' form (Legan1994The).

Post-translational modifications of DSC3 may include phosphorylation and glycosylation, although specific modifications are not detailed in the context. The quaternary structure involves the assembly of DSC3 into desmosomes, where it pairs with desmogleins to form isostoichiometric oligomers stabilized by plakoglobin (Franke2009Discovering).

## Function
Desmocollin 3 (DSC3) is a calcium-dependent desmosomal cadherin protein that plays a crucial role in cell adhesion within epithelial tissues. It is an integral component of desmosomes, which are specialized cell-cell junctions that provide mechanical strength and maintain tissue integrity by linking to the intermediate filament apparatus of vertebrate cells (Shukla2020DESMOCOLLIN; Cui2011DSC3). DSC3 is primarily expressed in the basal and first suprabasal cell layers of the skin, where it contributes to the formation, morphogenesis, maturation, and homeostasis of epithelial tissues (Shukla2020DESMOCOLLIN; Lotti2019Development).

In healthy human cells, DSC3 is involved in maintaining the structural integrity of tissues by facilitating strong intercellular connections, which are essential for processes such as cell proliferation, polarity, migration, and differentiation (Shukla2020DESMOCOLLIN). The protein's function is associated with inhibiting cell motility, a critical aspect of maintaining normal cellular behavior and tissue integrity (Cui2011DSC3). DSC3's expression is regulated by the tumor suppressor protein p53, indicating its potential role in cellular stress responses and tumor suppression (Shukla2020DESMOCOLLIN).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DSC3 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. A bi-allelic missense variant in DSC3 has been linked to hypotrichosis with recurrent skin vesicles (HYPTSV), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by sparse hair and recurrent skin blisters. This condition was identified in a 4-year-old boy with a novel variant (c.154G>C; p.Val52Leu) in the DSC3 gene, suggesting that such mutations can disrupt the protein's structure and function, leading to the observed symptoms (Al2022Case).

In the context of cancer, DSC3 expression is frequently downregulated in breast cancer, particularly in invasive ductal and lobular carcinomas. This downregulation is often due to epigenetic silencing through promoter methylation, which is a common event in breast cancer and contributes to tumor progression by reducing cell adhesion and increasing cellular mobility (Oshiro2005Epigenetic). Similarly, in colorectal cancer, DSC3 methylation is associated with poor prognosis and reduced expression, indicating its potential role as a prognostic marker. The regulation of DSC3 by the tumor suppressor protein p53 further underscores its significance in cancer biology (Cui2011DSC3).

## Interactions
Desmocollin 3 (DSC3) is a desmosomal cadherin that plays a crucial role in cell-cell adhesion within epithelial tissues. It forms part of the desmosome complex by interacting with other desmosomal proteins such as desmogleins, plakoglobin, and plakophilins. These interactions are essential for linking the intermediate filament cytoskeleton to the desmosomal plaque, thereby providing mechanical strength and stability to tissues like the epidermis (Ferone2012p63; Johnson2014Desmosomes:).

DSC3 is primarily expressed in the basal layers of the epidermis, where it interacts with armadillo proteins and plakins, forming the structural backbone of the desmosome (SMITH2004Regulation). The transcriptional regulation of DSC3 involves CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs), which bind to specific sites on the DSC3 promoter, influencing its expression during keratinocyte differentiation (SMITH2004Regulation).

In addition to its structural role, DSC3 is involved in signaling pathways such as the EGFR/RAS/RAF/MAPK pathway, where it acts to suppress proliferation in human lung cancer cells (Müller2021Desmosomes). This highlights its dual function in both maintaining cell adhesion and regulating cell signaling.
