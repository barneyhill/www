# ROR2

## Overview
The ROR2 gene encodes the receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 2, a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in noncanonical Wnt signaling pathways. This protein is characterized by its complex structure, which includes an extracellular region with an immunoglobulin-like domain, a Frizzled-like cysteine-rich domain, and a Kringle domain, as well as an intracellular region containing a tyrosine kinase domain and a serine/threonine/proline-rich domain (Griffiths2021Structure; Li2019Purification). ROR2 is involved in crucial developmental processes such as polarized cell migration and morphogenesis by acting as a receptor or coreceptor for Wnt5a, thereby mediating signaling pathways essential for tissue and organ development (Minami2009Ror‐family). Mutations in the ROR2 gene are linked to skeletal disorders like Robinow syndrome and brachydactyly type B, and its altered expression has been associated with certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Afzal2003One; Minami2009Ror‐family).

## Structure
The ROR2 protein is a receptor tyrosine kinase with a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. The extracellular region of ROR2 comprises an immunoglobulin-like domain, a Frizzled-like cysteine-rich domain (CRD), and a Kringle domain. The CRD is crucial for WNT5A signaling and is stabilized by five disulfide bonds, while the Kringle domain is stabilized by two disulfide bonds (Griffiths2021Structure; Li2019Purification). The CRD of ROR2 is unique in that it lacks the typical hydrophobic pocket for lipid binding, suggesting a distinct mechanism for ligand interaction (Griffiths2021Structure). 

The intracellular region of ROR2 contains a tyrosine kinase domain and a serine/threonine/proline-rich domain, which are involved in signal transduction (Griffiths2021Structure). ROR2 is a single-pass transmembrane protein, and its extracellular region is involved in protein-protein interactions, potentially modulating the function of the CRD (Li2019Purification). 

Post-translational modifications of ROR2 include phosphorylation, which is common among receptor tyrosine kinases. The protein also has splice variant isoforms, which may have different functional roles (Li2019Purification).

## Function
The ROR2 gene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a crucial role in noncanonical Wnt signaling, particularly through its interaction with Wnt5a. In healthy human cells, ROR2 is involved in regulating polarized cell migration and developmental morphogenesis. It acts as a receptor or coreceptor for Wnt5a, mediating signaling pathways essential for processes such as convergent extension movements and planar cell polarity, which are vital for proper tissue and organ development (Minami2009Ror‐family).

ROR2 inhibits the β-catenin-TCF pathway and activates the Wnt/JNK pathway, leading to polarized cell migration. The extracellular cysteine-rich domains (CRDs) of ROR2 are essential for binding to Wnt5a and other proteins, facilitating diverse cellular responses. The cytoplasmic regions contain conserved tyrosine kinase domains involved in signal transduction through autophosphorylation and interaction with downstream substrates (Minami2009Ror‐family).

ROR2 also interacts with the actin-binding protein filamin A (FLNa) via its proline-rich domain, which is crucial for filopodia formation and Wnt5a-induced cell migration. This interaction is important for JNK activation, suggesting a role for FLNa as a scaffold in the Wnt5a/ROR2/JNK signaling pathway (Minami2009Ror‐family).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ROR2 gene are associated with two distinct skeletal disorders: autosomal recessive Robinow syndrome (RRS) and autosomal dominant brachydactyly type B (BDB1). RRS is characterized by severe skeletal dysplasia, including short stature, limb shortening, spine defects, and craniofacial abnormalities. It is caused by homozygous loss-of-function mutations in the ROR2 gene, which affect various domains such as the cysteine-rich domain, kringle domain, and tyrosine kinase domain, leading to disrupted protein-protein interactions and improper protein folding (Afzal2003One; Minami2009Ror‐family). 

In contrast, BDB1 is characterized by terminal deficiency of fingers and toes, often resulting from heterozygous truncating mutations in the ROR2 gene. These mutations typically lead to a gain-of-function effect, causing a severe phenotype due to the production of truncated proteins that may have dominant-negative functions (Afzal2003One; Minami2009Ror‐family). 

Altered expression of ROR2 has also been implicated in cancer, with increased expression observed in squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity and osteosarcoma cell lines, where it is associated with malignancy and invasiveness (Minami2009Ror‐family).

## Interactions
ROR2, a receptor tyrosine kinase, participates in various protein interactions that influence its role in Wnt signaling pathways. ROR2 interacts with PTK7, forming a co-receptor complex that affects neural crest cell migration in Xenopus. This interaction is mediated by their extracellular domains, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Podleschny2015A).

ROR2 also interacts with TAK1 (TGF-β activated kinase 1), where TAK1 phosphorylates the carboxyterminal serine/threonine/proline-rich (STP) domain of ROR2. This interaction is dependent on TAK1's kinase activity and is modulated by Wnt ligands, with Wnt1 displacing TAK1 from ROR2 (Winkel2008Wntliganddependent).

In the context of Wnt signaling, ROR2 interacts with Wnt5a, which induces ROR2 homodimerization and activation, leading to tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of downstream signaling pathways in osteoblastic cells (Liu2008Wnt5a). ROR2 also forms heterooligomers with ROR1 in response to Wnt5a, enhancing leukemia cell chemotaxis and proliferation (Yu2015Wnt5a). These interactions highlight ROR2's role in both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways.
