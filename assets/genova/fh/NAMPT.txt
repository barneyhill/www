# NAMPT

## Overview
Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is a gene that encodes the enzyme nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, which plays a pivotal role in the NAD+ salvage pathway. This enzyme is crucial for cellular metabolism, as it catalyzes the conversion of nicotinamide to nicotinamide mononucleotide, a precursor in the biosynthesis of NAD+. NAMPT is categorized as a transferase enzyme and is expressed ubiquitously across human tissues, underscoring its broad physiological significance. It is involved in various cellular processes, including energy metabolism, mitochondrial biogenesis, and stress responses. The enzyme's activity is intricately regulated by circadian rhythms and post-translational modifications, which influence its function in maintaining cellular homeostasis. NAMPT's interactions with other proteins and signaling pathways further highlight its role in cellular regulation and its potential as a therapeutic target, particularly in cancer and cardiovascular diseases (S.2011NAMPT; Garten2015Physiological; Dou2015Association).

## Structure
Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is an enzyme involved in the NAD+ salvage pathway, crucial for cellular metabolism. The primary structure of NAMPT consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain. Its secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which contribute to the enzyme's stability and function. The tertiary structure of NAMPT is characterized by a three-dimensional folding that is essential for its enzymatic activity, including the formation of a Rossmann fold, a common nucleotide-binding domain (Tanuma2020Structural).

NAMPT functions as a homodimer, representing its quaternary structure. This dimerization is critical for its catalytic activity, as it forms two unique tunnel-shaped cavities adjacent to each active site at the dimer interface. These cavities are vital for the enzyme's role in catalyzing the conversion of nicotinamide and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate to nicotinamide mononucleotide (Tanuma2020Structural).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can regulate NAMPT's activity, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. The presence of splice variant isoforms is suggested, which may lead to different functional forms of the enzyme, but specific details are not provided in the context.

## Function
Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is a critical enzyme in the NAD+ salvage pathway, catalyzing the conversion of nicotinamide (NAM) to nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), which is subsequently converted to NAD+. This process is essential for maintaining NAD+ levels, which are crucial for various cellular functions, including redox reactions and as a substrate for NAD+-dependent enzymes like sirtuins and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) (S.2011NAMPT; Garten2015Physiological).

NAMPT is expressed in nearly all human tissues, indicating its broad physiological roles. It influences cellular metabolism, mitochondrial biogenesis, and adaptive responses to stress (Garten2015Physiological). In skeletal muscle, NAMPT is upregulated in response to exercise, correlating with increased mitochondrial content and improved insulin sensitivity, suggesting its role in energy metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis (Costford2010Skeletal).

Intracellularly, NAMPT is involved in maintaining NAD+ levels and recycling NAM, which is crucial for the function of NAD+-dependent enzymes. Its activity is regulated by circadian rhythms, which affect NAD+ levels and, consequently, the activity of these enzymes (Garten2015Physiological). NAMPT's role in NAD+ biosynthesis is vital for cellular homeostasis, influencing processes like DNA repair, gene expression, and cell survival (S.2011NAMPT).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the NAMPT gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. NAMPT is overexpressed in various cancers, including breast, colorectal, hepatocellular, pancreatic, and renal cancers, and is associated with poor survival rates and advanced disease stages (Lin2022Updated). In breast cancer, high NAMPT expression correlates with poor overall and disease-free survival, larger tumor size, advanced clinical stages, and lymph node metastasis (Zhou2018Expression). NAMPT overexpression is also linked to resistance to chemotherapeutic agents and targeted therapies, such as BRAF inhibitors in melanoma, where it contributes to drug resistance and tumor aggressiveness (Indini2022NADNAMPT; Audrito2022Tumors).

NAMPT's role extends beyond cancer, impacting cardiac health. Polymorphisms in the NAMPT gene, such as rs9034, are associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), influencing susceptibility and prognosis (Dou2015Association). NAMPT also plays a role in inflammatory responses, with its serum levels correlating with inflammatory markers in heart failure and DCM patients (Dou2015Association). These findings highlight NAMPT's potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in various diseases.

## Interactions
NAMPT, or nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, is involved in several critical protein interactions that influence cellular processes. NAMPT forms a stable complex with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), which is essential for the nuclear translocation of NAMPT. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the nuclear NAD+ pool, particularly under stress conditions, by supporting the NMN/NAD+ salvage pathway in the nucleus (Grolla2020A). The NAMPT-GAPDH complex is a heterotrimeric structure, consisting of a NAMPT dimer and a GAPDH monomer, which is vital for the stress-induced NMN/NAD+ salvage pathway (Grolla2020A).

NAMPT also interacts with oncogenic signaling pathways, such as AKT and ERK1/2. Inhibition of NAMPT can decrease phospho-ERK1/2 levels, enhancing cell death when combined with ERK1/2 blockade (Heske2020Beyond). Additionally, NAMPT is involved in regulating sirtuin function, particularly SIRT1, forming a positive feedback loop with c-Myc and SIRT1 in colorectal cancer models, which promotes tumor cell proliferation (Heske2020Beyond). These interactions highlight NAMPT's role in cellular homeostasis and its potential as a target in cancer therapy.
