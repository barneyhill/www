# EXOSC4

## Overview
EXOSC4 is a gene that encodes the protein exosome component 4, a non-catalytic subunit of the RNA exosome complex. This complex is essential for RNA processing and degradation, playing a critical role in the maturation and turnover of various RNA species, including ribosomal RNA (rRNA), small nuclear RNA (snRNA), and messenger RNA (mRNA) (Taniue2022RNA; Fraga2020Posttranscriptional). The EXOSC4 protein is part of the core structural framework of the exosome, contributing to the formation of a barrel-like hexameric structure that facilitates RNA substrate interaction with the complex's catalytic subunits (Gerlach2018Distinct). This structural role is crucial for maintaining the integrity and function of the exosome in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it is involved in RNA quality control and gene expression regulation (Taniue2022RNA). EXOSC4's interactions with other exosome components and histone modifications further underscore its importance in cellular homeostasis and genomic stability (Stransky2024EXOSC4; Sterrett2020A).

## Structure
EXOSC4 is a structural subunit of the RNA exosome complex, which is involved in RNA processing and degradation. It forms part of a barrel-like hexameric structure that serves as a scaffold for RNA substrates. This hexameric structure is highly conserved in eukaryotes and is composed of the EXOSC4-EXOSC9 subunits (Fraga2020Posttranscriptional). The EXOSC4 protein, equivalent to hRRP41 in humans, is part of the core of the exosome complex, which includes a base ring of six RNase PH-like subunits and a cap ring of three S1/KH-like proteins (Gerlach2018Distinct).

The human exosome complex, including EXOSC4, has a longer RNA channel compared to its yeast counterpart, allowing for a more extended RNA path (Gerlach2018Distinct). The structural organization of the human exosome is similar to bacterial RNase II, with specific domains such as the PIN domain shaping the RNA-binding cleft and the CSD1 and S1 domains forming a funnel-like cleft leading to the RNB domain, where the exoribonuclease active site is located (Gerlach2018Distinct).

EXOSC4 interacts with other subunits, such as EXOSC2, where specific amino acid residues at the interface are crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the exosome complex (Sterrett2020A).

## Function
EXOSC4 is a component of the RNA exosome complex, which is crucial for RNA processing and degradation in healthy human cells. This complex is involved in the maturation and turnover of various RNA species, including ribosomal RNA (rRNA), small nuclear RNA (snRNA), and messenger RNA (mRNA) (Fraga2020Posttranscriptional). EXOSC4 is part of the catalytically inactive barrel structure known as EXO9, which forms a scaffold for RNA substrates, facilitating their interaction with the exosome's catalytic subunits (Taniue2022RNA; Fraga2020Posttranscriptional).

The RNA exosome, including EXOSC4, operates in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, playing a vital role in RNA quality control and the regulation of gene expression. It ensures proper RNA processing and turnover, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing the accumulation of aberrant RNAs (Taniue2022RNA). The exosome's activity is mediated by catalytic subunits such as DIS3, DIS3L, and EXOSC10, which have distinct subcellular localizations and functions (Fraga2020Posttranscriptional). EXOSC4 contributes to the structural integrity of the exosome, supporting its role in various cellular processes, including the regulation of nuclear transcripts and the processing of rRNA and small nucleolar RNA (Fraga2020Posttranscriptional).

## Clinical Significance
The EXOSC4 gene, a component of the RNA exosome complex, has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in RNA processing and degradation. In the context of cancer, EXOSC4 is frequently amplified in multiple cancer types, including pancreatic cancer, where its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and increased tumorigenicity (Taniue2022RNA). Knockdown studies in pancreatic cancer cell lines have shown that reducing EXOSC4 expression leads to decreased cell growth and increased apoptosis, suggesting its critical role in cancer cell survival (Taniue2022RNA). This makes EXOSC4 a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer (Taniue2022RNA).

In neurological diseases, while EXOSC4 has not yet been directly linked to specific pathologies, it is part of the RNA exosome complex, which is associated with exosomopathies. These are rare diseases caused by mutations in RNA exosome subunits, often leading to neurological defects such as cerebellar atrophy (de2023Analysis). The potential involvement of EXOSC4 in such conditions remains an area for future research.

## Interactions
EXOSC4 is a non-catalytic component of the RNA exosome complex, which is involved in RNA processing and degradation. It interacts with histone H3 that is co-modified with K9me3 and acetylations, playing a crucial role in the surveillance of non-coding transcription. This interaction is essential for maintaining RNA homeostasis and regulating gene expression (Stransky2024EXOSC4). 

EXOSC4 is specifically enriched in interactions with histone H3 peptides that are co-modified with K9me3 and multiple acetylations, such as K14ac, K18ac, and K23ac. This suggests that EXOSC4 acts as a reader of these combinatorial histone marks, which are associated with both constitutive heterochromatin and accessible chromatin regions (Stransky2024EXOSC4). 

In the context of the RNA exosome complex, EXOSC4 interacts with other exosome components, such as EXOSC2. Structural modeling studies have shown that amino acid substitutions in EXOSC2 can disrupt its interaction with EXOSC4, indicating a critical interface between these subunits (Sterrett2021A; Sterrett2020A). 

EXOSC4's interactions extend to its role in RNA surveillance, where it is involved in regulating non-coding RNAs and maintaining genomic stability, particularly under stress conditions (Stransky2024EXOSC4).
