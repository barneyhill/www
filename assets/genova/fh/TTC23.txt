# TTC23

## Overview
TTC23 is a gene that encodes the protein tetratricopeptide repeat domain 23, which is characterized by the presence of tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains. These domains are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions and are crucial in the assembly of multiprotein complexes. The TTC23 protein is notably involved in the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, particularly within the ciliary structure known as the Ellis-van Creveld (EvC) zone, which is essential for Hh signaling but not for cilium assembly (Breslow2017A). TTC23 interacts with other proteins such as IQCE and EFCAB7, playing a significant role in the regulation of this signaling pathway. Beyond its developmental functions, TTC23 has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly in the context of hypoxia-induced alternative splicing in prostate cancer cells (Bowler2018Hypoxia). Additionally, mutations and alterations in the TTC23 gene have been associated with various developmental and neurodevelopmental disorders, suggesting its broader clinical significance (Domenici2022Candidate; SchluthBolard2019Whole).

## Function
TTC23 is a gene that encodes a protein containing tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which are known to facilitate protein-protein interactions and are involved in the assembly of multiprotein complexes. The TTC23 protein is implicated in ciliary Hedgehog (Hh) signaling, a critical pathway for various developmental processes. It localizes to the Ellis-van Creveld (EvC) zone of the cilium, a region important for Hh signaling but not necessary for cilium assembly. In this context, TTC23 interacts with proteins IQCE and EFCAB7, which are also components of the EvC zone. Knockout studies of Ttc23 in cells have shown a moderate reduction in inducible blasticidin resistance and decreased localization of IQCE and EVC to the EvC zone, indicating its role in Hh signaling (Breslow2017A).

In addition to its role in ciliary signaling, TTC23 has been linked to cancer biology. Under hypoxic conditions, alternative splicing of TTC23 is altered in prostate cancer cells, suggesting a potential role in cancer adaptation to low oxygen environments (Bowler2018Hypoxia). However, the specific function of TTC23 in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TTC23 gene have been implicated in several developmental and neurodevelopmental disorders. In a study involving patients with developmental disorders, chromosomal rearrangements disrupting the TTC23 gene were identified, suggesting a potential link to these conditions (SchluthBolard2019Whole). Additionally, TTC23 has been associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) through DNA methylation alterations, indicating that changes in its expression may contribute to the etiology of ASD (Domenici2022Candidate).

The TTC23 gene has also been identified in a CRISPR-based screen for Hedgehog signaling, highlighting its involvement in ciliary signaling pathways. While the precise role of TTC23 in these pathways requires further study, its association with ciliary function suggests that mutations could potentially lead to ciliopathies (Breslow2017A).

In the context of intellectual disability, a study identified a splice acceptor mutation in TTC23 in a family with affected children, although the primary focus was on another gene, LINS, as the causative factor (Akawi2013LINS). These findings collectively suggest that TTC23 may play a role in various genetic syndromes and disorders, although its specific clinical significance remains to be fully elucidated.

## Interactions
TTC23, a protein encoded by the human TTC23 gene, is involved in protein-protein interactions within the context of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling. Through a CRISPR-based screen, TTC23 was identified as a component of the Ellis-van Creveld (EvC) zone, a region of the cilium crucial for Hh signaling. This zone includes proteins such as EVC, EVC2, IQCE, and EFCAB7. TTC23 interacts with IQCE and EFCAB7, as identified by affinity purification and mass spectrometry. These interactions suggest that TTC23 plays a role in the assembly or function of the EvC zone, contributing to Hh signaling pathways (Breslow2017A).

In Ttc23 knockout cells, there is a reduction in the localization of IQCE and EVC to the EvC zone, indicating that TTC23 is necessary for the proper positioning of these proteins. Conversely, RNA interference targeting Iqce results in decreased localization of TTC23 to the EvC zone, highlighting a reciprocal relationship between these proteins (Breslow2017A). These findings establish TTC23 as a novel component of the EvC zone, participating in the regulation of Hh signaling through its interactions with other proteins in this multiprotein complex.
