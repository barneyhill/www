# HNRNPA1

## Overview
HNRNPA1 is a gene that encodes the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1), a multifunctional RNA-binding protein that plays a pivotal role in RNA metabolism. The hnRNP A1 protein is characterized by its RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a glycine-rich domain, which facilitate its binding to RNA and involvement in processes such as pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA trafficking, and translation. As a member of the hnRNP family, hnRNP A1 is predominantly nuclear but can shuttle to the cytoplasm, where it influences mRNA export and translation. The protein's ability to bind to splicing silencers and telomeric sequences underscores its importance in regulating gene expression and maintaining telomere integrity (Thibault2021hnRNP; Jean-Philippe2013hnRNP). Mutations in HNRNPA1 have been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Clarke2021A; Beijer2021Characterization).

## Structure
The HNRNPA1 protein is composed of 320 amino acids and features two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) in its N-terminal region, known as unwinding protein 1 (UP1), which spans residues 1 to 196 (Barraud2012Solution; Xu1997Crystal). These RRMs, RRM1 and RRM2, are crucial for RNA binding and are connected by a flexible linker, allowing them to act as a single RNA-binding unit (MAYEDA1998Distinct; Barraud2012Solution). The RRMs are characterized by conserved RNP-1 and RNP-2 submotifs, which form an antiparallel β-sheet structure essential for RNA interaction (Xu1997Crystal).

The C-terminal region of HNRNPA1 is glycine-rich and includes a prion-like domain (PrLD) with an RGG motif and a proline-tyrosine nuclear localization signal (PY-NLS), facilitating nuclear import (Beijer2021Characterization). The protein's tertiary structure is stabilized by Arg-Asp salt bridges between the RRMs, which are important for maintaining the geometry necessary for RNA binding (MAYEDA1998Distinct; Xu1997Crystal).

HNRNPA1 undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and methylation, which may influence its function and localization. The protein also has splice variant isoforms that could differ in their functional roles (Beijer2021Characterization).

## Function
The HNRNPA1 gene encodes the hnRNP A1 protein, a multifunctional RNA-binding protein involved in various aspects of RNA metabolism in healthy human cells. It plays a critical role in pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA trafficking, translation, and microRNA processing. Structurally, hnRNP A1 contains RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a glycine-rich domain, which are essential for its RNA binding capabilities (Jean-Philippe2013hnRNP). The protein is predominantly located in the nucleus but can shuttle to the cytoplasm, a process facilitated by the M9 domain, which acts as both a nuclear localization and export signal (Jean-Philippe2013hnRNP).

In the nucleus, hnRNP A1 regulates alternative splicing by binding to splicing silencers, influencing exon inclusion or exclusion (Jean-Philippe2013hnRNP). It also plays a role in telomere maintenance by binding to telomeric sequences, promoting telomerase activity, and protecting telomeres from degradation (Thibault2021hnRNP). In the cytoplasm, hnRNP A1 is involved in mRNA export and translation, affecting mRNA stability and translation initiation through interactions with internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) (Clarke2021A; Jean-Philippe2013hnRNP). These functions highlight hnRNP A1's importance in gene expression regulation and cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HNRNPA1 gene are associated with a range of neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and multisystem proteinopathy (MSP). Specific mutations such as p.D262V, p.D262N, and p.N267S have been linked to ALS and FTD, where they contribute to insoluble protein aggregation and altered protein dynamics, potentially affecting stress granule biology (Clarke2021A; Beijer2021Characterization). These mutations can lead to cytoplasmic mislocalization and inclusion formation, which colocalize with stress granules (Clarke2021A).

HNRNPA1 mutations also play a role in hereditary motor neuropathy and distal myopathy, with specific mutations like P288A and G304Nfs*3 affecting stress granule dynamics and fibrillization (Beijer2021Characterization). The prion-like domain (PrLD) of hnRNPA1 is crucial for its function, and mutations in this region can lead to both gain-of-function and loss-of-function consequences, exacerbating the formation of cytoplasmic aggregates and persistent stress granules (Beijer2021Characterization).

Altered expression levels of hnRNPA1 are implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Huntington's disease (HD), where they influence amyloid-β and Tau aggregate formation, as well as mitochondrial dynamics, respectively (Clarke2021A). Dysregulation of hnRNPA1 is also linked to cancer progression, affecting mRNA stability and miRNA biogenesis, which can promote tumor proliferation and migration (Feng2022hnRNP).

## Interactions
HNRNPA1 interacts with both proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. It binds to single-stranded nucleic acids, with a preference for RNA over DNA, and exhibits cooperative binding through its glycine-rich C-terminal domain (Nadler1991Interactions; Cobianchi1988Mammalian). The protein's N-terminal domain contains RNA recognition motifs that facilitate its binding to RNA, influencing splicing and RNA processing (Levengood2019Idiosyncrasies).

HNRNPA1 also interacts with IκBα, a component involved in NF-κB signaling, which is necessary for maximal activation of NF-κB-dependent transcription. This interaction is direct and independent of NF-κB subunits, highlighting a specific protein-protein interaction crucial for transcriptional activation (Hay2001Interaction). HNRNPA1 enhances NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activation by promoting the degradation of IκBα, which is dependent on the phosphorylation of specific serine residues (Hay2001Interaction).

In the context of alternative splicing, HNRNPA1 binds to exonic splicing silencers and can displace other proteins, such as SR proteins, from RNA secondary structures, thereby inhibiting splicing (Okunola2009CooperativeBinding). These interactions underscore HNRNPA1's role in regulating gene expression and RNA metabolism.
