# CCDC18

## Overview
CCDC18 is a gene that encodes the protein coiled-coil domain containing 18, which is categorized as a centriolar satellite protein. This protein is involved in the centrosome-cilium interface, playing a crucial role in the regulation of satellite morphology and intensity. CCDC18 interacts with a network of proteins, including PCM1 and CEP290, which are integral to centriolar satellite function (Gupta2015A). The gene has been implicated in various cancers, such as colorectal cancer, where mutations in CCDC18 may increase susceptibility (EstebanJurado2015Wholeexome; Gylfe2013Eleven). Additionally, CCDC18 is involved in adipogenesis, with its expression regulated by NSRP1, affecting pre-adipocyte proliferation and differentiation (Liu2024Comprehensive). The emerging significance of CCDC18 in genetic studies highlights its potential as a target for further research in cancer predisposition and cellular regulation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CCDC18 gene have been implicated in familial colorectal cancer (CRC). Studies have identified rare truncating variants in CCDC18 among familial CRC cases, suggesting a potential role in increasing susceptibility to this type of cancer (Gylfe2013Eleven). The presence of these variants in multiple familial cases supports the hypothesis that CCDC18 may contribute to CRC predisposition, although further research is needed to confirm its pathogenicity (Gylfe2013Eleven).

In addition to truncating variants, a specific variant, c.3268G>A, in CCDC18 was identified with a frequency of 3.69% in a study cohort, indicating its potential involvement in familial CRC (EstebanJurado2015Wholeexome). The gene has been categorized as a 'new' gene associated with CRC, highlighting its emerging significance in genetic studies of the disease (EstebanJurado2015Wholeexome).

The role of CCDC18 in CRC is further supported by its inclusion in multigene panels used to identify pathogenic variants in CRC-predisposing genes. Frameshift variants in CCDC18 have been noted as interesting candidates for further investigation, although specific conditions directly associated with these mutations remain to be fully elucidated (Hansen2017Use).

## Interactions
CCDC18 is identified as a centriolar satellite protein that co-localizes with PCM1, a marker of centriolar satellites, suggesting its involvement in a satellite subnetwork. This subnetwork includes proteins such as PCM1, SSX2IP, KIAA0753, OFD1, and CEP290, indicating a high degree of connectivity with the core module of the centrosome-cilium interface (Gupta2015A). CCDC18 is implicated in affecting satellite intensity, as its knockdown influences the intensity of satellite markers PCM1 and CEP290, suggesting a role in the regulation of satellite morphology (Gupta2015A).

While specific physical interactions of CCDC18 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, its proximity profile is similar to that of CCDC14, hinting at a potential partnership (Gupta2015A). CCDC18 is also involved in the regulation of endometrial, renal, breast, colorectal, and lung squamous cell carcinomas, although specific interaction partners in these contexts are not provided (Priyanka2021CoiledCoil). The protein's role in adipogenesis is regulated by NSRP1, which influences the alternative splicing and expression of CCDC18, affecting pre-adipocyte proliferation and differentiation (Liu2024Comprehensive).
