# SLC28A1

## Overview
The SLC28A1 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 28 member 1, commonly known as human concentrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hCNT1). This protein is a transmembrane transporter that plays a critical role in the cellular uptake of pyrimidine nucleosides through a sodium-dependent mechanism. hCNT1 is predominantly expressed in the apical membranes of renal and intestinal epithelial cells, where it facilitates the absorption and reabsorption of nucleosides, thereby influencing nucleotide synthesis and cellular homeostasis (PastorAnglada2018Emerging; CanoSoldado2012Functional). The protein's structure includes 13 transmembrane domains, with a sodium-binding pocket essential for its function (Damaraju2005Identification). Genetic variations in SLC28A1 can impact the function of hCNT1, affecting drug sensitivity and efficacy, particularly for nucleoside-derived chemotherapeutic agents (Persaud2023Increased).

## Structure
The SLC28A1 gene encodes the human concentrative nucleoside transporter-1 (hCNT1), a membrane protein involved in the transport of pyrimidine nucleosides and their derivatives. The primary structure of hCNT1 consists of 650 amino acids, with a high degree of identity to its rat homolog (Damaraju2005Identification). The protein is predicted to have 13 transmembrane domains, based on glycosylation studies and site-specific antibody experiments (Damaraju2005Identification).

The secondary structure of hCNT1 includes transmembrane helices, which are crucial for its function. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices into a three-dimensional conformation that facilitates nucleoside transport. The protein's quaternary structure may involve interactions with other proteins or subunits, although specific details are not provided in the context.

A key feature of hCNT1 is the sodium-binding pocket, which is essential for its transport function. The Ser546 residue, located in transmembrane domain 12, is highly conserved and plays a significant role in substrate binding and translocation. Mutation of this residue to proline (S546P) results in a nonfunctional transporter, highlighting its importance in maintaining the structural integrity of the sodium-binding pocket (CanoSoldado2012Functional).

## Function
The SLC28A1 gene encodes the human concentrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hCNT1), which is integral to the transport of pyrimidine nucleosides across cell membranes. This transporter operates through a sodium-dependent mechanism, facilitating the uptake of nucleosides in a 1:1 sodium/nucleoside coupling ratio (PastorAnglada2018Emerging; Ritzel1997Molecular). hCNT1 is predominantly expressed in the apical membranes of renal and intestinal epithelial cells, where it plays a crucial role in the absorption and reabsorption of nucleosides, impacting nucleotide synthesis and cellular homeostasis (CanoSoldado2012Functional).

In healthy human cells, hCNT1 is involved in maintaining nucleotide balance by reabsorbing pyrimidine nucleosides in the kidneys, preventing their loss through urine (Persaud2023Increased). This function is essential for the pharmacokinetics of nucleoside-derived drugs, as hCNT1 can influence drug sensitivity and efficacy, particularly for chemotherapeutic agents like gemcitabine (Persaud2023Increased). The transporter also has potential roles in nucleoside sensing and signal transduction, acting as a transceptor, which implies a dual role in transport and signaling (PastorAnglada2018Emerging). Genetic variations in SLC28A1, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms, can affect the function of hCNT1, leading to altered drug responses and potential metabolic disorders (Persaud2023Increased).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SLC28A1 gene, which encodes the concentrative nucleoside transporter 1 (CNT1), have significant clinical implications. Variants in SLC28A1 can lead to impaired transport function, affecting the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of nucleoside-based drugs, such as chemotherapeutic agents like gemcitabine and 5'-fluorouracil. This can result in increased renal elimination and reduced systemic exposure, compromising drug efficacy in cancer treatments (Persaud2023Increased).

SLC28A1 mutations are also associated with metabolic disorders. For instance, functional mutations in SLC28A1 can cause uridine-cytidinuria (URCTU), characterized by elevated urinary excretion of uridine and cytidine (Persaud2023Increased). Additionally, specific mutations, such as p.R510C and p.R561Q, have been linked to a rapidly developing lethal phenotype due to multi-organ failure, highlighting the gene's role in pyrimidine metabolism (PérezTorras2019Deficiency).

Altered expression of CNT1 has been observed in various cancers, including solid tumors and leukemia, where nucleoside analogs are used as first-line treatments. Reduced CNT1 expression can lead to decreased drug efficacy and predictability, underscoring the importance of evaluating CNT1 levels in optimizing treatment strategies (Persaud2023Increased).
