# SLC45A4

## Overview
SLC45A4 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 45 member 4, a neuronal polyamine transporter. This protein is part of the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) and is characterized by its 12 transmembrane spanning alpha helices, which facilitate the transport of polyamines across cellular membranes (Middleton2024Identification). The SLC45A4 protein plays a critical role in mitochondrial putrescine transport, contributing to the de novo synthesis of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in human cells, particularly in GAD-negative tissues such as dopaminergic neurons (Colson2024SLC45A4encodes). The gene's involvement in GABA metabolism underscores its importance in various cellular processes, and its altered expression has been linked to several diseases, including cancer and pain perception disorders (Chen2021SLC45A4; Middleton2024Identification).

## Structure
The SLC45A4 protein is a neuronal polyamine transporter with a complex molecular structure. It consists of 12 trans-membrane spanning alpha helices, adopting the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) fold, which is characterized by two six-helical bundles in an inward open state (Middleton2024Identification). A distinctive feature of SLC45A4 is a large 25.5 kDa cytoplasmic domain inserted between transmembrane helices 6 and 7. This domain is mostly disordered but includes a plug domain (residues 414-462) that auto-inhibits the transporter by interacting with intracellular gating helices (Middleton2024Identification).

The plug domain contains conserved basic side chains, such as Lys450 and Arg453, which interact with an acidic ladder on transmembrane helix 4 and other conserved aromatic side chains within the binding site. These interactions suggest a mechanism for polyamine transport similar to that of the lysosomal polyamine transporter ATP13A2 (Middleton2024Identification). The structure of SLC45A4 was determined using cryo-electron microscopy, achieving a resolution of 2.8 Å, which facilitated detailed model building and analysis (Middleton2024Identification). The protein's structure suggests a mechanism of membrane destabilization to facilitate polyamine release (Middleton2024Identification).

## Function
The SLC45A4 gene encodes a mitochondrial putrescine transporter that plays a crucial role in promoting the de novo synthesis of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in human cells. This gene is part of the solute carrier family, which consists of membrane proteins responsible for transporting ions and metabolites across cellular membranes. SLC45A4 is localized to the mitochondrial membrane and facilitates GABA production through the Arginine/Ornithine/Putrescine (AOP) pathway, an alternative to the canonical GABA synthesis pathway involving glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) enzymes. This pathway is particularly important in GAD-negative cells and tissues, such as dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain (Colson2024SLC45A4encodes).

SLC45A4's function in healthy human cells is largely related to its role in GABA metabolism, which is crucial for various cellular processes. The gene facilitates the uptake of putrescine into mitochondria, supporting GABA synthesis. Experiments have shown that SLC45A4 knockout cells exhibit reduced GABA levels, indicating its essential role in this metabolic pathway (Colson2024SLC45A4encodes). The transporter is also involved in the conversion of ornithine and intracellular putrescine to GABA, highlighting its importance in cellular metabolism (Colson2024SLC45A4encodes).

## Clinical Significance
The SLC45A4 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its altered expression or mutations. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), SLC45A4 is overexpressed, particularly in cases with TP53 mutations, and is associated with poor prognosis. Its knockdown in TP53 mutant PDA cell lines reduces cell proliferation and tumor growth, suggesting its role in promoting glycolysis and cancer progression (Chen2021SLC45A4). Similarly, in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), SLC45A4 overexpression is linked to malignant progression through glycolytic metabolic reprogramming, and its silencing leads to reduced tumor growth and metastasis (Xu2024SLC45A4).

SLC45A4 is also associated with pain perception. Variants in this gene have been linked to altered pain intensity, and its role as a neuronal polyamine transporter suggests its involvement in modulating pain sensitivity (Middleton2024Identification). In early-onset preeclampsia, SLC45A4 is significantly downregulated in syncytiotrophoblast membrane extracellular vesicles, indicating a potential role in the disease's pathophysiology, although this requires further exploration (Awoyemi2023A). Additionally, SLC45A4 is part of a prognostic gene signature for early-stage triple-negative breast cancer, indicating its potential as a biomarker for disease prognosis (Kim2024A).
