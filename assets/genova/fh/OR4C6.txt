# OR4C6

## Overview
The OR4C6 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily C member 6, which is part of the large family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). These receptors are integral membrane proteins involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the olfactory system. The OR4C6 protein, like other olfactory receptors, is characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is typical of many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors. This gene is part of the largest gene family in the human genome, highlighting its significance in sensory perception and potential implications in various physiological processes (Raka2021Human).

## Clinical Significance
The OR4C6 gene, part of the olfactory receptor family, has been associated with obesity-related conditions. A genome-wide study identified a deletion covering OR4C6 and two other loci, which has been linked to early-onset obesity (Shadravan2013Sex). Variations in OR4C6, along with other olfactory receptor genes such as OR4P4 and OR4S2, have been directly associated with obesity, suggesting a role in eating behaviors and adiposity (Lee2018Therapeutic; Raka2021Human). Despite these associations, the specific clinical significance of OR4C6 mutations in diseases other than obesity is not well-documented. 

In the context of breast cancer, deletions overlapping OR4C6 were investigated but were not found to be associated with an increased risk of the disease after multiple testing corrections (Walker2017Increased). This suggests that while OR4C6 may play a role in metabolic conditions, its involvement in cancer risk remains unclear. Overall, the clinical implications of OR4C6 are primarily linked to obesity, with further research needed to elucidate its role in other conditions.
