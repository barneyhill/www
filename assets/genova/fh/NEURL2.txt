# NEURL2

## Overview
NEURL2 is a gene that encodes the protein neuralized E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2, which is involved in the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins. As an E3 ubiquitin ligase, NEURL2 plays a critical role in various cellular processes by tagging proteins for degradation, thereby regulating protein turnover and maintaining cellular homeostasis. The protein is implicated in several pathological conditions, including endometrial cancer and spinal muscular atrophy, due to its influence on protein degradation pathways (Ding2022Relationship; McCormack2021A). NEURL2's function in these diseases highlights its potential as a therapeutic target, particularly in conditions where modulation of protein levels is beneficial (Myllykangas2008Integrated; McCormack2021A).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
NEURL2 has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in protein ubiquitination and degradation. In endometrial cancer (EC), NEURL2 is one of the five hub genes significantly correlated with the disease. It is associated with the infiltration of CD8+ T cells and is related to the prognosis of EC patients. High expression of NEURL2 is significantly associated with worse survival outcomes in EC patients, and genetic alterations, mainly amplifications, occur in about 3% of EC samples (Ding2022Relationship).

In spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), NEURL2 is involved in the regulation of the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. It acts as an E3 ligase that promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of SMN. Knocking down NEURL2 increases SMN protein levels, suggesting that inhibiting NEURL2 could be a potential therapeutic strategy to increase SMN levels in SMA patients (McCormack2021A).

NEURL2 has also been identified in the context of gastric cancer, where it is one of the genes with increased copy numbers that help classify gastric cancers based on their location (Myllykangas2008Integrated).
