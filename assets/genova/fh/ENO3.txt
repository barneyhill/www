# ENO3

## Overview
The ENO3 gene encodes the β-enolase protein, a glycolytic enzyme predominantly expressed in muscle tissue. As a member of the enolase family, β-enolase plays a crucial role in the glycolytic pathway by catalyzing the conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate, a key step in energy production, particularly under anaerobic conditions (Peshavaria1991Molecular; Comi2001β‐enolase). The protein is characterized by an α/β barrel structure and requires divalent cations, such as Mg2+, for its catalytic activity (Peshavaria1991Molecular; Holmes2011Bioinformatic). ENO3 is specifically expressed in striated muscles, including skeletal and cardiac muscles, and is essential for meeting the high metabolic demands of these tissues (Keller1992Activation). Mutations in the ENO3 gene are linked to metabolic myopathies, such as glycogen storage disease type XIII, and alterations in its expression have been associated with cancer progression, highlighting its clinical significance (Chen2022ENO3; Comi2001β‐enolase).

## Structure
The ENO3 gene encodes the β-enolase protein, which is primarily expressed in muscle tissue. The protein consists of 433 amino acids and is structured with an α/β barrel, a common fold in enolase proteins, where α-helices surround β-strands to form the active site (Peshavaria1991Molecular). The ENO3 protein requires two divalent cations, typically Mg2+, for its catalytic activity, which bind at distinct sites to facilitate the glycolytic reaction (Holmes2011Bioinformatic).

The ENO3 gene contains 12 exons, and its structure is highly conserved across species, indicating a common evolutionary origin (Holmes2011Bioinformatic). The protein's sequence aligns closely with other enolase proteins, such as yeast enolase-1, suggesting a conserved protein structure (Peshavaria1991Molecular). The ENO3 protein may undergo post-translational modifications, including acetylation and phosphorylation, which are significant for the regulation of cellular metabolism (Holmes2011Bioinformatic).

The ENO3 gene also features a CpG-rich region and a TATA box in its promoter, indicating complex transcriptional regulation. Muscle-specific enhancers are located within the first intron, binding myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2 proteins, which contribute to its tissue-specific expression (Holmes2011Bioinformatic).

## Function
The ENO3 gene encodes the β-enolase enzyme, a critical component of the glycolytic pathway. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate, a key step in glycolysis, which is essential for energy production in muscle cells, particularly under anaerobic conditions (Peshavaria1991Molecular; Comi2001β‐enolase). In healthy human muscle, over 90% of enolase activity is attributed to the β-enolase subunit, highlighting its significant role in muscle metabolism (Comi2001β‐enolase).

β-enolase is primarily expressed in skeletal muscle and is involved in glycogen and cholesterol metabolism (Cui2021ENO3). The enzyme's activity is crucial for meeting the high metabolic demands of muscle tissue, reflecting its importance in muscle function and energy metabolism (Peshavaria1991Molecular). The ENO3 gene is specifically expressed in striated muscles, including skeletal and cardiac muscles, and its expression is an early marker of myogenic differentiation during muscle development (Keller1992Activation).

The β-enolase enzyme is localized in the cytoplasm, where it participates in the glycolytic pathway, contributing to the efficient production of ATP, which is vital for muscle contraction and overall muscle performance (Peshavaria1991Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ENO3 gene, which encodes the β-enolase enzyme, are associated with β-enolase deficiency, a rare metabolic myopathy classified as glycogen storage disease type XIII (GSDXIII). This condition is characterized by exercise intolerance, myalgias, and episodic rhabdomyolysis. Patients with GSDXIII exhibit a significant reduction in muscle β-enolase activity, leading to a partial block in glycolysis and limiting high-intensity exercise capacity. Despite this glycolytic defect, patients can produce lactate in normal amounts during nonischemic exercise (Buch2021Energy; Comi2001β‐enolase).

The ENO3 gene mutations identified in affected individuals include two heterozygous missense mutations: G467A and G1121A, which result in amino acid changes near the enzyme's catalytic site, likely decreasing its stability. These mutations were not found in control subjects, suggesting their pathogenicity (Comi2001β‐enolase).

Alterations in ENO3 expression have also been implicated in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. ENO3 is upregulated in CRC tissues, and its increased expression is associated with advanced pathological stages and poorer survival outcomes. Functional assays indicate that ENO3 enhances cell proliferation and migration, suggesting its role in promoting tumor growth (Chen2022ENO3).

## Interactions
ENO3, or enolase 3, primarily interacts with sarcomeric troponin in muscle cells, which is significant for muscle contraction dynamics and efficient energy metabolism (Horvat2024Multifunctional; Holmes2011Bioinformatic). This interaction is crucial for localized ATP production within muscle fibers, and a deficiency in the enolase β-subunit is associated with muscle weakness (Holmes2011Bioinformatic). ENO3 is also involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, where its high expression is linked to increased levels of E-cadherin and the down-regulation of p-GSK-3β, suggesting a role in inhibiting EMT and potentially acting as a suppressor in cancer progression (Horvat2024Multifunctional).

While ENO3 shares structural similarities with other enolase isoforms, specific interactions with nucleic acids or participation in multiprotein complexes beyond its interaction with troponin are not detailed in the available context (Peshavaria1991Molecular; Holmes2011Bioinformatic). The gene's promoter region contains motifs for transcriptional regulation, indicating potential interactions with transcription factors, but these interactions are not explicitly described (Peshavaria1991Molecular).
