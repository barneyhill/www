# SF3A1

## Overview
The SF3A1 gene encodes the splicing factor 3a subunit 1, a critical component of the spliceosome machinery involved in pre-mRNA splicing. This protein is part of the SF3A complex, which is essential for the assembly of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex. The SF3A1 protein, characterized by its ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain, plays a pivotal role in RNA binding, specifically interacting with the stem-loop 4 (SL4) of U1 snRNA, which is crucial for the formation of the prespliceosomal A complex. This interaction facilitates the proper alignment of splice sites, ensuring accurate splicing of pre-mRNAs. SF3A1 is active in the nucleus and is involved in regulating gene expression, influencing cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and differentiation (Sharma2014Stem–loop; Martelly2019Identification). Mutations in SF3A1 have been associated with various cancers and hematological disorders, although their impact is less frequently discussed compared to other spliceosomal components (Visconte2012Emerging).

## Structure
The SF3A1 protein is a component of the U2 snRNP complex involved in pre-mRNA splicing. It is a 120 kDa protein consisting of 793 amino acids and lacks a conventional RNA-binding domain (Martelly2019Identification). The protein contains several important regions, including two suppressor-of-white-apricot (SURP) domains at the amino terminus, a nuclear localization signal (NLS), and a ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain at the carboxy terminus (Martelly2019Identification). The UBL domain, spanning residues 703-793, is identified as a noncanonical RNA-binding domain, specifically binding to the stem-loop 4 (SL4) of U1 snRNA with high affinity (K D = ∼97 nM) (Martelly2019Identification).

The UBL domain shares structural similarities with ubiquitin, including a ββαββαβ topology, but features a longer linker between β strands and additional positively charged residues at the carboxy-terminal end (Martelly2019Identification). This domain is crucial for RNA binding and is unique to higher eukaryotes, absent in the yeast ortholog Prp21 (Martelly2019Identification). Mutations in conserved tyrosine residues Y772 and Y773 within the UBL domain significantly affect its RNA-binding capability, highlighting their importance in the molecular structure and function of SF3A1 (Martelly2019Identification).

## Function
The SF3A1 gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the spliceosome, specifically as part of the SF3A complex. This complex is essential for the assembly of the U2 snRNP, which plays a significant role in pre-mRNA splicing by facilitating the removal of introns and the ligation of exons (Sharma2014Stem–loop; Martelly2019Identification). SF3A1 interacts with other proteins, such as SF3A2 and SF3A3, to form the SF3A complex, which is necessary for the formation of the mature 17S U2 snRNP (Martelly2019Identification).

The SF3A1 protein contains a ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain at its carboxy-terminal, which acts as a noncanonical RNA-binding domain. This domain binds with high affinity to stem-loop 4 (SL4) of the U1 snRNA, a critical interaction for the formation of the prespliceosomal A complex during the early steps of spliceosome assembly (Sharma2014Stem–loop; Martelly2019Identification). The interaction between SF3A1 and U1 snRNA is crucial for pairing the 5' and 3' splice sites, which is essential for the proper assembly of the spliceosome and subsequent splicing of pre-mRNAs (Sharma2014Stem–loop). SF3A1 is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to gene expression regulation and influences cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and differentiation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the SF3A1 gene have been studied in relation to various cancers and hematological disorders. Although SF3A1 polymorphisms have been linked to several cancers, including esophageal adenocarcinoma, myxoid liposarcomas, synovial sarcomas, osteosarcomas, endometrial tumors, lung cancer, breast cancer, ovarian carcinoma, gastric cancer, and glioblastoma, specific studies have shown no significant association between SF3A1 polymorphisms and colorectal cancer risk in a Chinese population (Chen2015The). Similarly, research on myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) found that SF3A1 polymorphisms do not significantly affect susceptibility to these conditions, although they may influence certain clinical features in MDS patients, such as higher hemoglobin levels and a lower frequency of chromosomal abnormalities (SF3A1&lt; i&gt; Kanayama2020&lt).

The role of SF3A1 in the spliceosome machinery is crucial for pre-mRNA splicing, and its mutations can lead to aberrant splicing, which is implicated in various diseases. While SF3A1 mutations are less frequently discussed compared to other spliceosomal components like SF3b1, they are still considered relevant in the context of hematological disorders (Visconte2012Emerging).

## Interactions
SF3A1 is a component of the U2 snRNP complex, playing a crucial role in spliceosome assembly. It interacts with the stem-loop 4 (SL4) of U1 snRNA through its ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain, which is essential for the proximity of the 5' and 3' splice sites during pre-mRNA splicing (Martelly2019Identification). The UBL domain specifically binds to G-C-rich stem-loop structures, with a high affinity for U1-SL4, and this interaction is critical for the formation of the prespliceosomal A complex (Martelly2019Identification).

SF3A1 also interacts with other U2 snRNP-associated proteins, such as SF3A2 and SF3A3, forming part of the mature 17S U2 snRNP complex necessary for pre-mRNA splicing (Martelly2019Identification). The interaction between SF3A1 and U1-SL4 is transient and occurs during the transition from the E to A complex in spliceosome assembly (Martelly2019Identification).

In addition to its role in RNA binding, SF3A1 is involved in protein-protein interactions. It co-immunoprecipitates with U2 snRNP-specific proteins, including SF1, suggesting a role in early spliceosome assembly (Crisci2015Mammalian). The SF3A1-U1 snRNA interaction is disrupted during the release of U1 snRNP from the mature spliceosome, highlighting its dynamic role in splicing (Sharma2014Stem–loop).
