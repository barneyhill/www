# LARGE1

## Overview
LARGE1 is a gene that encodes the protein LARGE xylosyl- and glucuronyltransferase 1, a bifunctional glycosyltransferase enzyme. This enzyme is integral to the synthesis of matriglycan, a polysaccharide essential for the proper glycosylation of α-dystroglycan, a receptor that connects the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix, particularly in muscle tissues. The LARGE1 protein is categorized as a type II membrane protein and is localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it facilitates the addition of xylose and glucuronic acid monomers to α-dystroglycan, thereby maintaining the structural integrity and function of tissues (Righino2020Identification; Katz2022Structural). Mutations in the LARGE1 gene can lead to dystroglycanopathies, a group of congenital muscular dystrophies characterized by defective glycosylation of α-dystroglycan, resulting in muscle weakness and other clinical manifestations (Shelton2021Muscular; Grewal2005Characterization).

## Structure
The LARGE1 protein is a bifunctional glycosyltransferase involved in the synthesis of matriglycan, a crucial polysaccharide for muscle function. It is a type II membrane protein localized in the Golgi apparatus, featuring a transmembrane/cytosolic region, a coiled-coil (CC) domain, and two catalytic domains with xylosyltransferase (Xyl-T) and glucuronyltransferase (GlcA-T) activities (Katz2022The; Joseph2022Structure). The Xyl-T domain is classified as a GT family 8 retaining transferase, while the GlcA-T domain is a GT family 49 inverting transferase. Both domains adopt a GT-A fold, characterized by a Rossmann-like structure, and coordinate a manganese co-factor using a conserved DXD motif and a C-terminal histidine sidechain (Joseph2022Structure; Katz2022Structural).

LARGE1 forms a homodimeric structure, facilitated by the CC domain, which is essential for its enzymatic activity and proper cellular localization. This dimerization brings the catalytic domains into close proximity, enhancing the processivity of matriglycan synthesis (Katz2022The; Katz2022Structural). The protein is glycosylated, with up to 20% of its molecular weight attributed to glycans, although dimerization remains unaffected by the removal of N-glycans (Joseph2022Structure). Mutations in LARGE1 can disrupt its structure and function, leading to conditions such as dystroglycanopathies (Katz2022The).

## Function
The LARGE1 gene encodes a bifunctional glycosyltransferase enzyme that plays a critical role in the synthesis of matriglycan, a polysaccharide essential for linking the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix in healthy human cells. This enzyme facilitates the addition of alternating xylose and glucuronic acid monomers to α-dystroglycan (α-DG), a receptor that connects the cytoskeleton with the extracellular matrix, particularly in muscle tissues (Righino2020Identification; Katz2022Structural). The proper glycosylation of α-DG by LARGE1 is crucial for its binding to laminin and other extracellular matrix proteins, maintaining the structural integrity and function of tissues (Righino2020Identification).

LARGE1 predominantly functions as a parallel dimer, which is essential for its enzymatic activity and proper cellular localization. This dimerization brings the active sites of its xylosyltransferase (Xyl-T) and glucuronyltransferase (GlcA-T) domains into close proximity, facilitating the efficient synthesis of matriglycan (Katz2022Structural). The enzyme's activity is necessary for the post-translational modification of α-DG, which is vital for its interaction with extracellular matrix proteins and maintaining the structural integrity of muscle tissues (Inamori2012Dystroglycan). Mutations in LARGE1 can disrupt these processes, leading to muscular dystrophies and other disorders (Katz2022Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LARGE1 gene are associated with a group of congenital muscular dystrophies known as dystroglycanopathies. These conditions are characterized by hypoglycosylation of α-dystroglycan, a crucial membrane protein for muscle integrity and extracellular matrix interactions. The hypoglycosylation leads to a loss of binding with extracellular ligands, contributing to the clinical manifestations of these disorders (Grewal2005Characterization). 

One specific form of dystroglycanopathy linked to LARGE1 mutations is congenital muscular dystrophy 1D (CMD1D), which can present with a spectrum of symptoms ranging from severe congenital onset with brain malformations to milder variants without brain involvement (Shelton2021Muscular). In humans, mutations such as a missense mutation (Glu509Lys) and a 1-base pair insertion (1999insT) in the LARGE1 gene have been identified in patients with MDC1D, a novel form of congenital muscular dystrophy. These mutations result in abnormal glycosylation of α-dystroglycan, leading to severe mental retardation and structural brain abnormalities (Longman2003Mutations).

The LARGE1 gene's role in glycosylation is crucial, and its dysfunction due to mutations can lead to significant clinical consequences, including muscle weakness, developmental delays, and brain malformations (Grewal2005Characterization).

## Interactions
LARGE1 interacts with α-dystroglycan (α-DG) to facilitate the synthesis and elongation of matriglycan, a crucial modification for proper muscle function. This interaction is essential for the glycosylation of α-DG, enabling it to bind effectively to extracellular matrix proteins such as laminin. The presence of the N-terminal domain of α-DG is necessary for LARGE1 to produce full-length matriglycan, which is critical for preventing muscular dystrophy (Okuma2022Dystroglycan).

LARGE1's activity is significantly enhanced by the phosphorylation of the core M3 trisaccharide on α-DG by Protein O-Mannose Kinase (POMK). This phosphorylation increases LARGE1's binding affinity for the core M3, facilitating the elongation of matriglycan. In the absence of POMK, LARGE1 can only synthesize a shorter form of matriglycan, which is insufficient for proper laminin binding and muscle function (Walimbe2020POMK).

In rhabdomyosarcoma, a type of cancer, the expression of LARGE1 is often reduced, leading to compromised glycosylation of α-DG. Ectopic expression of LARGE1 in these cells can restore matriglycan modification and laminin binding, highlighting its critical role in maintaining the functional glycosylation of α-DG (Beltrán2019Exogenous).
