# CHPT1

## Overview
CHPT1 (choline phosphotransferase 1) is a gene that encodes an integral membrane enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC), a critical component of eukaryotic cell membranes. The protein product, choline phosphotransferase 1, is categorized as a transmembrane enzyme and is primarily localized to the Golgi apparatus. It functions as a homodimer, with each monomer comprising 10 transmembrane helices, and catalyzes the final step of the CDP-choline pathway, also known as the Kennedy pathway. This pathway is essential for the production of PC, which is vital for maintaining membrane integrity and facilitating cell signaling processes (Wang2023Structure; Tavasoli2020Genetic). The enzyme's activity is dependent on the presence of Mg2+ ions, which are crucial for its catalytic function (Wang2023Structure). CHPT1 has been implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including cancer and metabolic disorders, highlighting its significance in cellular homeostasis and disease (Mazi2019Dysregulated; Moestue2010Distinct).

## Structure
The CHPT1 protein, specifically from Xenopus laevis (xlCHPT1), has been structurally characterized using cryo-electron microscopy. It forms a homodimer, with each protomer containing 10 transmembrane helices (TMs) (Wang2023Structure). The first six TMs create a cone-shaped enclosure in the membrane, which is crucial for its catalytic function, opening to the cytosolic side where CDP-choline and two Mg2+ ions are coordinated (Wang2023Structure). The structure reveals a pseudo two-fold symmetry between TM3-6 and TM7-10, suggesting an evolutionary development from prokaryotic ancestors through gene duplication (Wang2023Structure).

The CDP-AP signature motif is located in TM2 and TM3, optimized for coordination of Mg2+ and the CDP group. His133 and Glu129 are proposed to be part of the catalytic mechanism, facilitating proton extraction and nucleophilic attack (Wang2023Structure). The dimerization interface is mediated by residues from TM7 and TM9, with aromatic stacking interactions and hydrogen bonds (Wang2023Structure). The lipid bilayer at the dimer interface is thinner, with a hydrophobic core of approximately 25 Å (Wang2023Structure). The structure provides insights into substrate recognition and catalysis, although specific post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms are not detailed in the available data (Wang2023Structure).

## Function
The CHPT1 gene encodes the enzyme cholinephosphotransferase 1, which plays a critical role in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC), the most abundant phospholipid in eukaryotic cell membranes. This enzyme catalyzes the final step of the CDP-choline pathway, also known as the Kennedy pathway, by transferring phosphocholine from CDP-choline to a diacylglycerol (DAG) backbone, forming PC (Wang2023Structure; Tavasoli2020Genetic). This process is essential for maintaining membrane structure and function, as PC is a major lipid building block of cellular membranes and serves as a source of numerous second messenger molecules (Tavasoli2020Genetic).

CHPT1 is an integral membrane-bound protein localized primarily to the Golgi apparatus, where it is active in the synthesis of PC (Tavasoli2020Genetic). The enzyme functions as a homodimer with 10 transmembrane helices and requires Mg2+ for its catalytic activity (Wang2023Structure). The enzyme's activity is crucial for cell functions, including lipid metabolism and cell signaling, and is vital for life at both the cellular and organismal levels (Tavasoli2020Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
CHPT1 (choline phosphotransferase 1) plays a significant role in choline metabolism, particularly in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho), a major component of cell membranes. Alterations in CHPT1 expression have been implicated in various diseases, notably cancer. In breast cancer, CHPT1 expression levels differ between basal-like and luminal-like subtypes, with significantly lower expression observed in basal-like models compared to luminal-like models. This differential expression suggests that CHPT1 may contribute to the distinct metabolic profiles observed in these cancer subtypes, potentially affecting tumor progression and response to treatment (Moestue2010Distinct).

In Wilson Disease (WD), a genetic disorder characterized by copper accumulation, CHPT1 is involved in the dysregulated choline metabolism observed in patients. The study of hepatic transcripts in tx-j mice, a model for WD, showed significant down-regulation of the CDP-choline pathway, including CHPT1, independent of copper overload. This suggests that mechanisms other than copper toxicity may influence CHPT1 expression and its associated pathways in WD, potentially contributing to the disease's metabolic abnormalities (Mazi2019Dysregulated).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of CHPT1 in both cancer and metabolic disorders, where its altered expression can impact disease progression and therapeutic outcomes.

## Interactions
CHPT1 interacts with the protein BRD4 in the context of prostate cancer, particularly in cells resistant to antiandrogen therapy. This interaction is mediated by CHPT1-eRNA, an enhancer RNA transcribed at the CHPT1 enhancer. CHPT1-eRNA binds to BRD4, which is crucial for the formation of super enhancers (SEs) and the regulation of CHPT1 expression. The interaction between CHPT1-eRNA and BRD4 is significant for BRD4 binding and activation of the CHPT1 SE, which is linked to enzalutamide resistance in prostate cancer. The study identifies specific regions in CHPT1-eRNA and BRD4 that are critical for their interaction, with BRD4 containing lysine-rich motifs that facilitate binding to nucleic acids (Wen2020Aberrant).

In addition to its role in prostate cancer, CHPT1 is involved in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, a key component of cell membranes. The enzyme functions as a homodimer and interacts with substrates such as CDP-choline and Mg2+ ions, which are essential for its enzymatic activity. The structure of CHPT1 includes specific residues that are important for substrate recognition and catalysis, although these interactions are more related to its enzymatic function rather than direct interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids (Wang2023Structure).
