# H2AC6

## Overview
The H2AC6 gene encodes the H2A clustered histone 6 protein, which is a variant of the histone H2A family. Histones are fundamental components of chromatin, playing a critical role in the structural organization of DNA within the nucleus and regulating gene expression. The H2A clustered histone 6 protein is involved in the packaging of DNA into nucleosomes, thereby influencing chromatin dynamics and accessibility. This protein is categorized as a histone, which is essential for the compaction of DNA and the regulation of transcriptional activity. Alterations in the expression of H2AC6 have been implicated in various cancers, where it can act as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor, depending on the context and cancer type (Alotaibi2023Global; Espiritu2021Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
The H2AC6 gene, also known as HIST1H2AC, plays a significant role in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia, H2AC6 is overexpressed in B-cells, correlating with cancer cell aggressiveness (Espiritu2021Molecular). In liver tumors, the expression ratio between H2AC6 and H2AC12 differs from normal tissues, and its overexpression is linked to poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma due to hypermethylation (Espiritu2021Molecular). In breast cancer, particularly estrogen-receptor-positive types, H2AC6 is overexpressed and acts as a mediator for estradiol-dependent transcription of oncogenes BCL2 and C-MYC, contributing to poor prognosis and treatment resistance (Dhahri2024Beyond; Espiritu2021Molecular).

In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), H2AC6 is downregulated, which is associated with lower survival times, particularly in African American and European populations (Alotaibi2023Global). This downregulation may play a role in ESCC progression, similar to its observed downregulation in HPV-positive neoplastic keratinocytes (Alotaibi2023Global). In colon adenocarcinoma, higher expression levels of H2AC6 are associated with poor prognosis, suggesting its role as a prognostic factor (Wang2022Identification).
