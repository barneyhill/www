# C7orf57

## Overview
C7orf57 is a gene located on chromosome 7 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 7 open reading frame 57. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions and interactions are not fully elucidated. The protein encoded by C7orf57 is categorized as a non-enzymatic protein, and it is implicated in the regulation of certain signaling pathways, such as the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway, which plays a role in cellular proliferation and differentiation (Qiu2020aarFDC). Understanding the precise biological roles and mechanisms of C7orf57 is an ongoing area of research, with potential implications for understanding certain diseases and developing therapeutic strategies.
