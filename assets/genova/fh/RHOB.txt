# RHOB

## Overview
RHOB is a gene that encodes the protein ras homolog family member B, a member of the Rho GTPase family, which is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, cell shape, and motility. The RHOB protein is characterized by its role as a molecular switch, cycling between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound states, and is categorized as a small GTPase. It is distinct from other Rho family members due to its unique post-translational modifications, such as geranylgeranylation and farnesylation, which are critical for its localization to cellular membranes (Ridley1997The; Adamson1992Posttranslational). RHOB is implicated in intracellular membrane trafficking, DNA damage response, and apoptosis, and it plays a significant role in cancer biology, often acting as a tumor suppressor (Gutierrez2019Regulation; Vega2016The). Its expression and activity are tightly regulated, and alterations in RHOB expression are associated with various pathological conditions, including cancer and age-related diseases (Gutierrez2019Regulation).

## Structure
The RHOB protein is a member of the Rho GTPase family, consisting of 196 amino acids (Ridley1997The). Its primary structure is highly similar to RhoA and RhoC, with notable differences at the carboxy terminus, where RHOB has three additional amino acids (Ridley1997The). The secondary structure of RHOB is dominated by α-helices, comprising 78% of the protein, with 34.18% as random coils, 19.9% as extended strands, and 6.12% as β-turns (Paul2023A).

RHOB contains a core G domain typical of RhoGTPases, featuring a 6-stranded mixed beta-sheet surrounded by 5 alpha-helices, and includes a helical insert region unique to this family (Schaefer2014Toward). The G domain has five conserved sequence motifs (G1-G5), with the G1 motif coordinating the beta-phosphate of the bound nucleotide and the Mg2+ ion (Schaefer2014Toward).

Post-translational modifications of RHOB include prenylation, specifically geranylgeranylation and farnesylation, which are crucial for its membrane localization (Ridley1997The; Adamson1992Posttranslational). RHOB also undergoes palmitoylation at cysteine residues, which is not observed in RhoA and RhoC (Adamson1992Posttranslational). These modifications influence its localization to endosomes, lysosomes, and the plasma membrane (Ridley1997The).

## Function
RHOB is a member of the Rho GTPase family, which plays a crucial role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton, cell shape, and motility. In healthy human cells, RHOB is involved in intracellular membrane vesicle dynamics, influencing the transport and signaling of receptors such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and kinases like Src and Akt (Vega2016The). RHOB is also implicated in the DNA damage response, where it is upregulated in response to stimuli such as UV irradiation and cytokines, contributing to DNA repair processes, particularly through homologous recombination (Vega2016The).

RHOB affects the trafficking of signaling molecules and is involved in the sorting and recycling of EGFR to lysosomes, impacting cellular homeostasis and stress responses (Vega2016The). It also plays a role in cell migration and adhesion by modulating β-integrin expression and localization, which is crucial for cell movement (Vega2016The). RHOB's activity is regulated by GTP/GDP loading, and it cycles between active and inactive states, with its localization influenced by post-translational modifications such as geranyl-geranylation and farnesylation (Vega2016The). These functions highlight RHOB's importance in maintaining cellular integrity and responding to environmental changes.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RHOB gene are linked to various cancers, where it often acts as a tumor suppressor. In lung cancer, particularly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), decreased RHOB expression is associated with increased tumor invasiveness and aggressiveness, mediated through pathways such as PI3K/AKT and Rac1 (Gutierrez2019Regulation). Loss of RHOB expression is also linked to a worse prognosis in NSCLC, with studies suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker for disease progression (Gutierrez2019Regulation).

In addition to lung cancer, RHOB expression is downregulated in other cancers, including pancreatic and cervical cancers, where its suppression is associated with tumorigenesis (Gutierrez2019Regulation). The gene's expression is also influenced by factors like EGFR and K-Ras mutations, which can suppress RHOB and contribute to chemotherapy resistance (Gutierrez2019Regulation).

RHOB's role extends beyond cancer, as its expression declines with age, particularly in muscle and lung tissues, correlating with an increased risk of cancer in older patients (Gutierrez2019Regulation). This age-related decline highlights RHOB's potential involvement in age-related cancer pathways.

## Interactions
RHOB, a member of the Rho GTPase family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with caspase 3, a key protein in the apoptosis pathway, with a high binding affinity, suggesting a role in regulating apoptosis in colorectal cancer (Kopsida2024RhoB). RHOB also interacts with TNFAIP1, a BTB/POZ domain-containing protein, in HeLa cells. This interaction is significant for inducing apoptosis, as coexpression of RHOB and TNFAIP1 leads to increased apoptosis through the JNK signaling pathway (Kim2009RhoB).

RHOB's interactions extend to its role in regulating cadherin expression and epithelial cell-cell interactions. In prostate cancer cells, RHOB influences cell migration by modulating the levels of E-cadherin and N-cadherin, affecting cell-cell adhesion and migration speed (Vega2015The). Additionally, RHOB is involved in the trafficking of growth factor receptors, such as EGF and VEGF receptors, which are crucial for cell signaling and migration (Vega2015The).

RHOB's interactions are not limited to proteins; it also interacts with nucleic acids, impacting gene expression and cellular stress responses. The presence of a polybasic region (PBR) in RHOB facilitates interactions with SmgGDS, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, and may regulate nucleocytoplasmic shuttling (Williams2003The).
