# TAFA4

## Overview
TAFA4, also known as FAM19A4, is a gene that encodes the TAFA chemokine-like family member 4 protein, which is part of the TAFA chemokine-like ligand family. This protein is categorized as a neurokine and is primarily involved in modulating immune responses and sensory perception, particularly pain. TAFA4 is predominantly expressed in nociceptors, such as dorsal root ganglia, and acts as a marker for C-low-threshold mechanoreceptors. It interacts with the formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1), a G protein-coupled receptor, to mediate various cellular processes, including macrophage chemoattraction and phagocytosis. Additionally, TAFA4 plays a role in nervous system repair and regeneration, as well as in enhancing the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10, which underscores its potential as a therapeutic target for pain relief and tissue repair (Qiu2022TAFA4IL10; Zhu2022Molecular).

## Structure
The TAFA4 protein, also known as FAM19A4, is a member of the TAFA chemokine-like ligand family. Its molecular structure includes a signal sequence comprising amino acid residues 1-30, followed by a chemokine-like protein structure from residues 31-140 (Zhu2022Molecular). The secondary structure of TAFA4 is characterized by an alpha helix at its N-terminal region and nine beta strands at its C-terminal region, as predicted by the Phyre2 web portal (Zhu2022Molecular). The predicted 3D structure of TAFA4 is consistent with these secondary structural features (Zhu2022Molecular).

TAFA4 is a secreted protein with a molecular weight of approximately 12 kDa (Zhu2022Molecular). It shares sequence homology with other TAFA family members, except for TAFA5, which has a slightly different motif (Zhu2022Molecular). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the chemoattraction of macrophages and phagocytosis, through its interaction with the formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1) (Zhu2022Molecular). The molecular events following TAFA4's ligand-receptor binding are not fully understood, indicating a need for further research to define its cellular signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms (Zhu2022Molecular).

## Function
TAFA4, also known as FAM19A4, is a member of the TAFA chemokine-like ligand family and functions as a neurokine involved in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, TAFA4 is predominantly expressed in nociceptors, such as dorsal root ganglia (DRG), and acts as a marker for C-low-threshold mechanoreceptors (C-LTMRs) (Zhu2022Molecular). It plays a significant role in the sensory perception of pain by modulating neuron excitation and regulating the somatic sensation threshold, which suggests its potential as an analgesic agent (Zhu2022Molecular).

TAFA4 binds to the cell surface receptor formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1), a G protein-coupled receptor, to mediate the chemoattraction of macrophages, phagocytosis, and the inflammatory profile of macrophages (Zhu2022Molecular). It is involved in immune responses within the central nervous system (CNS) and acts to regulate nervous cell and tissue repair and regeneration after brain injury (Zhu2022Molecular). TAFA4 also enhances the production of IL-10 by macrophages, which helps in reducing inflammation and promoting tissue regeneration, particularly following UV-induced skin damage (Zhu2022Molecular). These functions highlight TAFA4's potential as a therapeutic target for pain relief and tissue repair.

## Interactions
TAFA4, also known as FAM19A4, is a neuropeptide that interacts with several proteins and receptors, influencing various cellular processes. One of its primary interactions is with the Formyl Peptide Receptor 1 (FPR1), a G protein-coupled receptor. This interaction is crucial for mediating macrophage chemoattraction, phagocytosis, and the release of reactive oxygen species (Zhu2022Molecular). The TAFA4-FPR1 interaction activates signaling pathways such as Akt phosphorylation and calcium mobilization, which are important for immune response modulation (Zhu2022Molecular).

In dendritic cells, TAFA4 induces the expression of IL-10 through the FPR1-MyD88-AKT signaling pathway, promoting the transformation of these cells into tolerogenic dendritic cells that support regulatory T cell development (Qiu2022TAFA4IL10). This interaction highlights TAFA4's role in enhancing allergen immunotherapy by modulating immune responses (Qiu2022TAFA4IL10).

TAFA4 also interacts with neurexins, which are presynaptic adhesion molecules, potentially mediating synaptic signaling and homeostasis (Zhu2022Molecular). These interactions suggest that TAFA4 plays a significant role in both immune regulation and neural activities, impacting processes such as inflammation and pain perception.
