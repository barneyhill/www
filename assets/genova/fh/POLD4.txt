# POLD4

## Overview
POLD4 is a gene that encodes the DNA polymerase delta 4, accessory subunit, a critical component of the DNA polymerase delta complex in eukaryotic cells. This protein plays a vital role in DNA replication and repair, particularly in lagging-strand synthesis, and is essential for maintaining genomic stability. As an accessory subunit, DNA polymerase delta 4 enhances the processivity and stability of the polymerase complex by interacting with other subunits and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (Huang2010Roles; Nicolas2016POLD1:). The gene's expression and function are crucial for cell cycle regulation and genomic integrity, with alterations in its expression linked to various cancers, including lung cancer and gliomas, where it influences tumor progression and immune response (Jiang2023POLD4).

## Function
POLD4 encodes the smallest subunit of DNA polymerase delta (Pol δ), which is crucial for DNA replication and repair in eukaryotic cells. It interacts with other subunits of Pol δ and the accessory protein PCNA to enable full enzymatic activity, enhancing the enzyme's processivity and stability (Huang2010Roles). POLD4 is involved in lagging-strand synthesis during DNA replication and plays a significant role in maintaining genomic stability. In healthy human cells, POLD4 acts as a mediator of faithful DNA synthesis and is involved in the maintenance of genomic stability (Jiang2023POLD4).

POLD4 is active in the nucleus, where DNA replication occurs, and is essential for the enzyme's full catalytic activity. In vitro studies show that DNA polymerase δ is less active without POLD4, indicating its necessity for optimal function (Huang2010Roles). POLD4 also plays a role in the G1-S cell cycle transition, and its inhibition can lead to genomic instability (Jiang2023POLD4). The gene's role in DNA damage repair and cell cycle regulation underscores its importance in maintaining genomic integrity in healthy cells, although the exact molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood (Jiang2023POLD4).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the POLD4 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer. In lung cancer, especially small cell lung cancer (SCLC), reduced POLD4 expression is linked to genomic instability and poor prognosis. This reduction is associated with increased chromosomal gaps and breaks, and elevated levels of γ-H2AX, a marker of DNA double-strand breaks. The downregulation of POLD4 in SCLC correlates with specific chromosomal deletions and amplifications, contributing to impaired DNA synthesis and repair activities, which are crucial for maintaining genomic stability (Huang2010Regulation).

In gliomas, POLD4 is overexpressed and associated with aggressive tumor phenotypes and poor survival outcomes. High POLD4 expression correlates with increased proliferation markers and immune checkpoint proteins, suggesting a role in tumor growth and immune evasion. This overexpression is linked to a suppressive immune microenvironment, potentially hindering the effectiveness of immunotherapy. POLD4's involvement in DNA damage repair pathways also influences drug resistance, impacting therapeutic strategies (Jiang2023POLD4).

Overall, POLD4 expression levels serve as a prognostic marker in various cancers, influencing disease progression, treatment response, and patient survival.

## Interactions
POLD4, a subunit of DNA polymerase delta, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its function in DNA replication and repair. It forms part of the DNA polymerase delta complex, which includes other subunits such as POLD1, POLD2, and POLD3. Within this complex, POLD4 interacts with the p50 subunit (POLD2), which acts as a scaffold, facilitating interactions with all other subunits (Nicolas2016POLD1:).

POLD4 also interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a critical component that enhances the processivity of DNA polymerase delta during DNA synthesis. This interaction is essential for the polymerase's function in both leading and lagging strand synthesis during DNA replication (Nicolas2016POLD1:).

In the context of cancer, POLD4's interactions extend to influencing the immune microenvironment. It is associated with immune checkpoint markers such as PD-L1, suggesting a role in modulating immune responses in tumors (Jiang2023POLD4). These interactions highlight POLD4's multifaceted role in cellular processes and its potential impact on cancer progression and treatment responses. However, specific details on transient or inhibitory interactions involving POLD4 are not extensively detailed in the available context.
