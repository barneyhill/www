# ZNF799

## Overview
ZNF799 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 799, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are small protein structural motifs that can coordinate one or more zinc ions to help stabilize their folds. Zinc finger protein 799 is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, by binding to DNA and influencing the expression of other genes. The specific biological roles and mechanisms of action of ZNF799 and its encoded protein are still under investigation, but they are believed to play a role in gene expression modulation and may be implicated in certain disease pathways (Qiu2020aarFDC).
