# AQP9

## Overview
Aquaporin 9 (AQP9) is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein aquaporin 9, which belongs to the aquaglyceroporin subfamily of aquaporins. This protein functions as a channel facilitating the transport of water, glycerol, and other small solutes across cell membranes, playing a crucial role in various physiological processes, including metabolism and immune responses. AQP9 is predominantly expressed in the liver and immune cells, where it contributes to gluconeogenesis, lipid homeostasis, and immune cell function. The protein's structure is characterized by six transmembrane domains and a homotetrameric assembly, which allows selective permeability through its pore. AQP9's expression and function are influenced by metabolic states and are implicated in several clinical conditions, including liver diseases, cancer, and immune disorders, highlighting its significance in health and disease (Liu2020Integrated; Carbrey2003Aquaglyceroporin; da2022The).

## Structure
Aquaporin-9 (AQP9) is a member of the aquaglyceroporin subfamily, characterized by its ability to facilitate the transmembrane flux of water, glycerol, and other small solutes. The primary structure of AQP9 consists of 280-320 amino acids, forming a protein with a molecular weight of approximately 28 kDa (da2022The). The secondary structure includes six hydrophobic transmembrane domains connected by five loops, with two half-helices containing conserved asparagine-proline-alanine (NPA) motifs, which are signature features of the aquaporin family (Verkman2000Structure; da2022The).

The tertiary structure of AQP9 forms a pore that allows selective permeability, with two filters determining its selectivity: a size-selective filter formed by aromatic/arginine residues and a charge-selective filter formed by the NPA motifs (da2022The). The quaternary structure is a homotetrameric assembly, where each monomer functions as an independent pore (Verkman2000Structure; da2022The).

AQP9 also features a potential N-linked glycosylation site at Asn 142 and a protein kinase C phosphorylation site at Ser 11, which may influence its function and localization (Tsukaguchi1999Functional). The protein is sensitive to inhibitors like phloretin and mercury chloride, which can affect its permeability to certain solutes (Tsukaguchi1999Functional).

## Function
Aquaporin-9 (AQP9) is a transmembrane protein channel that plays a significant role in facilitating the transport of water, glycerol, and other small solutes across cell membranes. It is primarily expressed in the liver, where it is involved in glycerol import from portal blood, crucial for gluconeogenesis and lipid homeostasis (da2022The; Carbrey2003Aquaglyceroporin). AQP9 is also expressed in immune cells, such as neutrophils and macrophages, where it regulates cell function, including F-actin polymerization and cell migration, and is implicated in immune responses (da2022The).

In epithelial cells, AQP9 enhances cell motility and wound healing by localizing to the plasma membrane and correlating with actin at the leading edge of cells, facilitating increased single-cell motility and epithelial sheet migration (Karlsson2013Water). AQP9's broad permselectivity allows it to transport various solutes, including urea, glycerol, and hydrogen peroxide, contributing to its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and facilitating metabolic processes (Tsukaguchi1999Functional; da2022The). The protein's expression is influenced by metabolic states, such as fasting, which increases its levels in the liver, highlighting its role in energy homeostasis (Carbrey2003Aquaglyceroporin).

## Clinical Significance
Aquaporin 9 (AQP9) is implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In liver diseases, AQP9 is overexpressed in chronic liver injury, where its silencing alleviates hepatic lipotoxicity and inflammation. Conversely, in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), AQP9 is downregulated, and its overexpression reduces cell invasion and migration, suggesting a role in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (da2022The). In non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), AQP9 deficiency is noted, and its overexpression exacerbates steatosis (da2022The).

AQP9 is also significant in immune responses, with increased expression in leukocytes during systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and infective endocarditis. Its role in immune cell migration impacts sepsis survival, as Aqp9 knockout mice show reduced inflammatory responses and improved survival in sepsis models (da2022The).

In cancer, AQP9 expression varies, being upregulated in breast, colorectal, and gastric cancers, but downregulated in lung cancer. High AQP9 expression correlates with poor prognosis in breast and lung cancers, yet predicts favorable outcomes in gastric cancer (Liu2020Integrated). AQP9 is also associated with immune infiltration in tumors, influencing tumor progression and immune cell interactions (Liu2020Integrated).

## Interactions
Aquaporin 9 (AQP9) is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in various physiological processes. In the male reproductive system, AQP9 interacts with the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and the Na+/H+ Exchanger Regulatory Factor (NHERF1). This interaction is mediated through CFTR's first nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1) and the PDZ1 and PDZ2 domains of NHERF1, which bind to AQP9's C-terminus containing a PDZ binding motif (SVIM). This complex is essential for water and solute transport, and its disruption may contribute to male infertility in cystic fibrosis (TörnrothHorsefield2022Insight).

In the context of the mouse retina, AQP9 interacts with monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) 1, 2, and 4, potentially playing a role in the astrocyte-to-neuron lactate shuttle by transporting lactate, an energy substrate (TörnrothHorsefield2022Insight).

AQP9 is also implicated in the immune response, where its expression correlates with various immune markers and may influence macrophage polarization and T cell exhaustion in the tumor microenvironment (Liu2020Integrated). These interactions highlight AQP9's role in both metabolic and immune processes.
