# CALCOCO1

## Overview
CALCOCO1 is a gene that encodes the protein calcium binding and coiled-coil domain 1, which is a member of the calcium-binding coiled-coil (CALCOCO) domain family. This protein is primarily involved in selective autophagy, particularly in the degradation of the endoplasmic reticulum, a process known as reticulophagy. As a selective autophagy receptor, it interacts with LC3 family members, notably MAP1LC3C, to facilitate this process. CALCOCO1 also plays a role in cellular metabolism by activating phosphoglucomutase, a key enzyme in the glycogen pathway, and functions as a transcriptional coactivator of nuclear steroid hormone receptors. The protein is predominantly cytosolic and undergoes lysosomal degradation in an autophagy-dependent manner. Mutations in the CALCOCO1 gene have been linked to various cancers, including breast and colorectal cancer, highlighting its potential role in tumor suppression and its clinical significance as a therapeutic target (Zhou2022ERphagy; Stefely2020Mass).

## Structure
CALCOCO1 is a protein that belongs to the calcium-binding coiled-coil (CALCOCO) domain family, which includes proteins like CALCOCO2 and TAX1BP1. It shares a similar domain structure with these proteins, featuring a SKICH domain, a non-canonical MAP1LC3C interacting region (CLIR), and a traditional LC3 interacting region (LIR) (Stefely2020Mass). These domains are crucial for its role in selective autophagy, with the SKICH domain being essential for this process, and the CLIR and LIR domains important for interactions with MAP1LC3C and GABARAP, respectively (Stefely2020Mass).

The N-terminal domain (NTD) of CALCOCO1 is defined as the sequence N-terminal to the conserved SKICH domain. The LIR motif, identified as DW(I/V)GI, is conserved across human and mouse CALCOCO proteins (Stefely2020Mass). The coiled-coil domain and the zinc finger domain are defined based on their alignment with those previously defined for CALCOCO2 (Stefely2020Mass). The protein also contains a protein-protein interaction (PPI) domain, which is located between the coiled-coil domain and the zinc finger domain (Stefely2020Mass).

CALCOCO1's structure suggests it may have unique protein interaction partners, potentially mediating distinct forms of selective autophagy (Stefely2020Mass). However, specific details on its primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, as well as post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
CALCOCO1 is a protein involved in selective autophagy, particularly in the degradation of the endoplasmic reticulum, a process known as reticulophagy. It functions as a selective autophagy receptor, interacting with LC3 family members, especially MAP1LC3C, to mediate this process. The interaction with MAP1LC3C is crucial for its role in reticulophagy, and deletion of CALCOCO1 impairs this process (Stefely2020Mass). CALCOCO1 also plays a role in balancing selective and bulk autophagy, as its absence leads to an increase in bulk autophagy (Stefely2020Mass).

In addition to its role in autophagy, CALCOCO1 is involved in cellular metabolism. It activates the enzyme phosphoglucomutase (PGM), which is part of the glycogen pathway, particularly under glucose conditions. This role may shift under galactose conditions, suggesting a regulatory mechanism that could involve glycosylation or phosphorylation (Stefely2020Mass). CALCOCO1 is also identified as a transcriptional coactivator of nuclear steroid hormone receptors, indicating its multifunctional nature (Stefely2020Mass). The protein is primarily cytosolic and is degraded by lysosomes in an autophagy-dependent manner (Stefely2020Mass).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CALCOCO1 gene have been associated with various diseases, particularly certain types of cancer. A notable mutation, R12H, has been identified in human breast tumors and is linked to an increased risk of breast cancer. This mutation impairs the interaction between CALCOCO1 and MAP1LC3C, suggesting a defect in reticulophagy, which may contribute to tumorigenesis (Stefely2020Mass; Haiman2009Screening). CALCOCO1 is also implicated in colorectal cancer, where its expression is reduced. This downregulation is thought to function as a tumor suppressor, potentially inhibiting cancer cell metastasis (Zhou2022ERphagy).

In addition to its role in cancer, CALCOCO1 is involved in the regulation of autophagy, a process crucial for cellular homeostasis. Alterations in its expression or function can lead to dysregulated autophagy, which is a feature of various diseases. The gene's expression is sensitive to MTOR inhibition, and its deletion has been shown to reduce reticulophagy significantly, indicating its importance in maintaining cellular function under stress conditions (Stefely2020Mass). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CALCOCO1 in cancer biology and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
CALCOCO1 is involved in various protein interactions, particularly in the context of selective autophagy. It interacts with members of the MAP1LC3/GABARAP family, showing a strong preference for MAP1LC3C. This interaction is mediated by CALCOCO1's non-canonical CLIR domain and its essential LIR motif (Stefely2020Mass). CALCOCO1 also interacts with TECPR2, which binds to MAP1LC3C through a canonical LIR motif, suggesting a collaborative role in autophagy processes (Stefely2020Mass).

CALCOCO1 is targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by interacting with VAPA/B, ER-membrane-localized proteins, via a FFAT-like motif. This interaction is crucial for ER-phagy under starvation-induced stress (Zhou2022ERphagy). The protein also contains a UDS-interacting region (UIR) that can bind to Atg8 family members, indicating its involvement in broader autophagy pathways (Zhou2022ERphagy).

In the context of cancer, CALCOCO1 expression is modulated by the long noncoding RNA LINC00052, which inhibits colorectal cancer metastasis by sponging miR-574-5p, thereby affecting CALCOCO1 levels (Yu2019Retracted:). This regulatory interaction highlights CALCOCO1's potential role in tumor suppression.
