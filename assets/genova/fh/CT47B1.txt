# CT47B1

## Overview
CT47B1 is a gene that encodes the protein cancer/testis antigen family 47 member B1, which is part of the cancer/testis antigen (CTA) family. These antigens are typically expressed in the testis and various cancer types, making them of particular interest in cancer research due to their restricted expression pattern. The CT47B1 protein is involved in protein-protein interactions, notably with GPR89A, and is implicated in forming molecular complexes within cellular networks (Kumar2016Cancertestis). Its expression is associated with different prognostic outcomes in cancers such as multiple myeloma and hepatocellular carcinoma, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Ding2020Discovery; Wang2022Immune). Despite its significance, the precise biological functions and mechanisms of CT47B1 remain to be fully elucidated, warranting further investigation into its role in cancer biology.

## Clinical Significance
CT47B1, a member of the cancer/testis antigen family, is implicated in various cancers due to its aberrant expression. In multiple myeloma (MM), CT47B1 is overexpressed in relapsed/refractory cases, correlating with worse clinical outcomes. This overexpression is associated with an immune suppressive microenvironment, characterized by increased M2 macrophages and reduced CD8+ T-cell presence, which may contribute to disease progression (Wang2022Immune). 

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CT47B1 is paradoxically associated with a better prognosis, although the specific mechanisms and clinical implications remain unclear (Ding2020Discovery). 

The gene was excluded from a study on multiple myeloma due to being a splicing variant, indicating potential complexities in its expression and function (van2011Cancer). 

CT47B1 is also mentioned in the context of pediatric renal tumors, where it is associated with dynamic copy number profiles, though its clinical significance in this setting is not detailed (Jiménez2018Circulating). 

Overall, CT47B1's expression in various cancers suggests its potential as a biomarker and a target for immunotherapy, although its role can vary significantly depending on the cancer type.

## Interactions
CT47B1, a member of the cancer/testis antigen family, is noted for its involvement in protein-protein interactions within cellular networks. In a study analyzing the functional relationships of cancer/testis antigens, CT47B1 was identified as being connected to GPR89A, indicating a physical interaction between these two proteins. This interaction was identified through clustering algorithms that revealed CT47B1's participation in a network of protein interactions, suggesting its potential role in forming or being part of molecular complexes (Kumar2016Cancertestis).

The study utilized clustering algorithms such as Mcl and Mcode to explore the interactions and complexes involving CT antigens, including CT47B1. These analyses highlighted the complexity and diversity of interactions that CT47B1 might engage in, although no sequence similarity was found among the interacting proteins, suggesting unique structural features that facilitate these interactions (Kumar2016Cancertestis).

Despite these findings, specific details about CT47B1's interactions with nucleic acids or its role in multiprotein complexes remain limited. The available data primarily emphasize its interaction with GPR89A and its potential involvement in broader protein networks (Kumar2016Cancertestis).
