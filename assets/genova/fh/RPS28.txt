# RPS28

## Overview
RPS28 is a gene that encodes the ribosomal protein S28, a component of the 40S subunit of the ribosome, which is essential for protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. The ribosomal protein S28 plays a pivotal role in the assembly and function of ribosomes, facilitating the translation of mRNA into proteins, a process fundamental to cellular growth and proliferation (Wei2019Ribosomal). This protein is categorized as a structural constituent of the ribosome and is active in the cytoplasm, where it is involved in the regulation of translational initiation and translation (Wei2019Ribosomal). Beyond its primary role in protein synthesis, RPS28 is implicated in specialized translation processes that contribute to immune function, particularly in the modulation of MHC class I peptide generation (Wei2019Ribosomal). Mutations in the RPS28 gene have been associated with Diamond-Blackfan Anemia, highlighting its clinical significance in ribosomopathies (Volejnikova2020Czech; Pelagiadis2023The).

## Function
RPS28 encodes a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, which is essential for protein synthesis in human cells. This protein plays a critical role in the assembly and function of ribosomes, facilitating the translation of mRNA into proteins, a fundamental process for cellular growth and proliferation (Wei2019Ribosomal). RPS28 is active in the cytoplasm, where ribosomes are located, and is involved in the regulation of translational initiation and translation (Wei2019Ribosomal).

In healthy human cells, RPS28 is implicated in modulating MHC class I peptide generation through non-canonical translation, which is crucial for T cell immunosurveillance (Wei2019Ribosomal). The knockdown of RPS28 has been shown to increase non-canonical translation by enhancing translation from untranslated regions (UTRs) and increasing non-AUG codon initiation, leading to increased class I expression and enhanced presentation of peptide-generating defective ribosomal products (DRiPs) (Wei2019Ribosomal). This suggests that RPS28 is involved in specialized translation processes that contribute to the generation of DRiPs, important for the rapid presentation of antigenic peptides (Wei2019Ribosomal). These functions highlight the role of RPS28 in maintaining cellular homeostasis and immune function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RPS28 gene are associated with Diamond-Blackfan Anemia (DBA), a congenital red cell aplasia characterized by bone marrow failure and anemia. Although RPS28 is not among the most frequently mutated ribosomal protein genes in DBA, it is included in the list of RP genes associated with the condition. The ClinVar database records fewer than 10 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variations in RPS28, indicating it is less frequently mutated compared to other RP genes like RPS19, RPL5, RPS26, and RPL11 (Volejnikova2020Czech; Pelagiadis2023The).

The mutations in ribosomal protein genes, including RPS28, can affect translational activity, protein folding, and ribosome biogenesis, typically in an autosomal dominant manner. These disruptions can lead to the hematological symptoms observed in DBA, such as severe anemia and an increased risk of malignancies (Volejnikova2020Czech). While specific conditions associated with RPS28 mutations are not extensively detailed, the gene's involvement in DBA suggests its clinical significance in ribosomopathies, which are disorders caused by defects in ribosomal proteins (Pelagiadis2023The).
