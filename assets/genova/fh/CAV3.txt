# CAV3

## Overview
CAV3 is a gene that encodes caveolin-3, a muscle-specific integral membrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the formation of caveolae, small invaginations in the plasma membrane of muscle cells. Caveolin-3 is categorized as a scaffolding protein, facilitating the organization and recruitment of signaling molecules and lipids within caveolae. It is predominantly expressed in skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle tissues, where it is crucial for maintaining muscle cell integrity and function. The protein interacts with components of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex, which is essential for proper muscle function and structural stability. Mutations in the CAV3 gene are linked to several muscle disorders, including limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1C and rippling muscle disease, highlighting its clinical significance in muscle physiology and pathology (Aboumousa2008Caveolinopathy; Galbiati2001Caveolin3; Fulizio2004Molecular).

## Structure
Caveolin 3 (CAV3) is an integral membrane protein primarily expressed in muscle tissues, playing a crucial role in the formation of caveolae. The molecular structure of CAV3 includes four distinct domains: a flexible N-terminal domain (NTD, residues 1-54), a scaffolding domain (CSD, residues 55-74), a membrane-embedded domain (residues 75-106), and a C-terminal cytosolic domain (CTD, residues 107-151) (Park2021Structural). The NTD contains a pH-sensitive helix region and a highly conserved signature motif (FEDVIAEP, residues 41-48) among the caveolin family (Tang1996Molecular). The CSD is essential for membrane association, cholesterol binding, and oligomerization (Park2021Structural).

The membrane-embedded domain features a U-shaped helix-break-helix motif that penetrates deeply into membrane bilayers (Park2021Structural). The CTD comprises four α-helices associated with the membrane surface and includes three palmitoylations on cysteine residues, which have a modest effect on the local structure (Kim2014Modest; Park2021Structural). CAV3 forms nonameric complexes, with a central cone-shaped density formed by the clustering of C-terminal domains from each monomer (Whiteley2012Characterization). This structural arrangement allows CAV3 to interact with various proteins, including the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RyR1) (Whiteley2012Characterization). The protein's oligomeric state and structure are sensitive to the membrane environment (Kim2014Modest).

## Function
Caveolin-3, encoded by the CAV3 gene, is a muscle-specific protein that plays a crucial role in the formation of caveolae, which are small invaginations in the plasma membrane of muscle cells. These structures are involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and lipid regulation (Ullrich2011Alterations; Galbiati2001Caveolin3). Caveolin-3 is predominantly expressed in skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle tissues, where it localizes to the sarcolemma and is associated with the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (Sotgia2000Caveolin3; Song1996Expression).

Caveolin-3 acts as a scaffolding protein within caveolae membranes, facilitating the recruitment and organization of signaling molecules and specific lipids (Song1996Expression). It interacts directly with β-dystroglycan, a component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex, which is important for maintaining muscle cell integrity and function (Sotgia2000Caveolin3). This interaction is crucial for the proper targeting and localization of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex to cholesterol-sphingolipid raft domains, which are essential for normal muscle function (Galbiati2001Caveolin3).

In healthy human cells, caveolin-3 is involved in the organization of sarcolemmal clusters and is essential for the proper functioning of excitation-contraction coupling in muscle cells, interacting with proteins important for calcium signaling and muscle contraction (Ullrich2011Alterations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CAV3 gene, which encodes the muscle-specific protein caveolin-3, are associated with a variety of muscle disorders. These include limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1C (LGMD1C), rippling muscle disease (RMD), distal myopathy, and hyperCKemia (Aboumousa2008Caveolinopathy; Fulizio2004Molecular). The mutations often result in a dominant-negative effect, where the mutant caveolin-3 protein impairs the function of the wild-type protein, leading to its rapid degradation and retention within the Golgi complex (Fulizio2004Molecular; Galbiati1999Phenotypic). This mislocalization prevents proper caveolae formation at the muscle cell membrane, contributing to muscle pathology (Galbiati1999Phenotypic).

CAV3 mutations can lead to a wide range of clinical phenotypes, even among individuals with the same mutation, indicating a lack of clear genotype-phenotype correlation (Fulizio2004Molecular). These mutations are typically inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, although some may follow an autosomal recessive pattern (McNally1998Caveolin3; Aboumousa2008Caveolinopathy). The clinical presentation can include muscle weakness, myalgia, and elevated serum creatine kinase levels, with varying ages of onset and degrees of muscle involvement (Aboumousa2008Caveolinopathy; Fulizio2004Molecular).

## Interactions
Caveolin 3 (CAV3) is known to interact with various proteins, forming complexes that play significant roles in muscle physiology. CAV3 interacts with T-type Ca2+ channel isoforms, specifically Ca v 3.1 and Ca v 3.2, in neonatal mouse ventricular myocytes and HEK293 cells. This interaction is particularly significant with Ca v 3.2, where co-expression with CAV3 reduces the channel's current, suggesting a functional modulation (Markandeya2011Caveolin3).

CAV3 also forms a scaffolding protein complex with SAP97, which regulates the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.5. This interaction involves a specific binding site on SAP97 and has been demonstrated in both in vivo and in vitro settings (Folco2004Caveolin3).

In skeletal muscle, CAV3 associates with the ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1), forming complexes that may influence muscle contraction and channel localization. This interaction is independent of triadin, another component of the calcium release complex (Whiteley2012Characterization).

CAV3 also interacts with other caveolin isoforms, such as Cav-1 and Cav-2, in muscle cells, forming a stable complex that is specific to this cell type (Capozza2005Musclespecific).
