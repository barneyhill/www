# SCUBE2

## Overview
SCUBE2 is a gene that encodes the protein signal peptide, CUB domain, and EGF-like domain-containing 2, which is a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes. This protein is a member of the SCUBE family and is characterized by its complex structure, including an N-terminal signal peptide, EGF-like repeats, cysteine-rich motifs, and a CUB domain. SCUBE2 plays a significant role in key signaling pathways, such as the Hedgehog and VEGF/VEGFR2 pathways, where it acts as a coreceptor and modulator, influencing processes like angiogenesis, bone formation, and cellular differentiation. Additionally, SCUBE2 has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer, where its expression levels correlate with disease prognosis and survival outcomes (Cheng2009SCUBE2; Lin2023The; Creanga2012ScubeYou).

## Structure
The SCUBE2 protein is a member of the SCUBE family, characterized by a complex molecular structure comprising several distinct domains. It consists of approximately 999 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 109.96 kDa (Kumar2022The). The protein includes an N-terminal signal peptide, nine tandem EGF-like repeats, a large spacer region, three cysteine-rich motifs, and a CUB domain at the C-terminus (Lin2023The; Kumar2022The). The EGF-like repeats are of the calcium-binding class and are organized in triplet modules, facilitating protein-protein interactions (Lin2023The). 

The CUB domain, a common feature in extracellular proteins, exhibits a β-sandwich fold and mediates protein-protein interactions, playing a crucial role in SCUBE2's function (Lin2023The). The spacer region, which is the least conserved among SCUBE family members, contains a conserved N-linked glycosylation motif, suggesting its involvement in unique functions (Lin2023The). 

SCUBE2 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which is essential for its secretion and cell-surface expression (Lin2023The). The protein can be cleaved by matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), which separates the C-terminal CR and CUB domains from the N-terminal EGF-like repeats (Lin2023The).

## Function
SCUBE2 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several critical cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of signaling pathways. In the Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway, SCUBE2 plays a vital role by facilitating the release and mobilization of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) proteins in a soluble form. This process is crucial for proper signaling and development, as SCUBE2 enhances the release of ShhNp, a dually lipid-modified protein, from cell membranes, thereby increasing its signaling activity (Creanga2012ScubeYou). SCUBE2 interacts with ShhN through its CUB domain, and its secretion is facilitated by the spacer region and Cys-rich domain (Creanga2012ScubeYou).

SCUBE2 also functions as a coreceptor in the VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling pathway, which is essential for angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. It enhances VEGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation and capillary-like network formation by facilitating VEGF binding to VEGFR2, thereby augmenting signal activity, including the phosphorylation of VEGFR2 and activation of MAPK/AKT pathways (Lin2023The).

In the context of endochondral bone formation, SCUBE2 modulates Indian Hedgehog (IHH) signaling, promoting the differentiation of osteoblasts from mesenchymal progenitor cells. This activity is crucial for chondrocyte differentiation and proliferation, highlighting SCUBE2's essential role in Ihh-dependent bone formation (Lin2023The).

## Clinical Significance
The SCUBE2 gene is implicated in various cancers, particularly breast cancer, where it often acts as a tumor suppressor. Alterations in SCUBE2 expression are associated with breast cancer progression and prognosis. High SCUBE2 expression is linked to favorable disease-free survival in breast cancer patients, while low expression is associated with increased mortality and tumorigenesis, especially in triple-negative breast cancer (Cheng2009SCUBE2; Lin2023The). SCUBE2 overexpression suppresses breast cancer cell proliferation and reduces tumor growth, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker for favorable clinical outcomes (Cheng2009SCUBE2).

In other cancers, SCUBE2 acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. It is downregulated in non-small-cell lung cancer, glioma, colorectal cancer, and gastric carcinoma, with low expression linked to advanced disease stages and poor prognosis (Kumar2022The; Lin2023The). SCUBE2 is also involved in tumor angiogenesis, acting as a coreceptor for VEGFR2, and its inhibition can reduce tumor growth and vascular density (Lin2023The).

SCUBE2 expression is regulated by the BMP and β-catenin pathways, and its alterations can influence cancer progression, making it a potential target for cancer therapeutics (Kumar2022The).

## Interactions
SCUBE2 is involved in various protein-protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and serves as a coreceptor for VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2), enhancing VEGF signaling and promoting angiogenesis (Lin2023The; Kumar2022The). SCUBE2 also interacts with bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP2/4), Sonic hedgehog (SHH), and Indian hedgehog (IHH), modulating their signaling activities (Lin2023The). 

In the context of breast cancer, SCUBE2 interacts with E-cadherin, a tumor suppressor, and inhibits the β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell adhesion and tumor suppression (Lin2023The). The protein is cleaved by MMP-2 protease into N-terminal and C-terminal fragments, with the N-terminal EGF-like repeats mediating cell-cell adhesion and the C-terminal CUB domain antagonizing BMP activity (Lin2023The).

SCUBE2 also plays a role in the Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway by facilitating the release of SHH from cell surfaces, a process dependent on its interaction with heparan sulfate (HS) (Jakobs2016Bridging). These interactions highlight SCUBE2's involvement in critical signaling pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer.
