# ERMARD

## Overview
ERMARD is a gene that encodes the ER membrane associated RNA degradation protein, which plays a crucial role in the cellular process of RNA quality control. This protein is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and is involved in the degradation of defective or surplus RNA molecules, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis. The ERMARD protein is categorized as a component of the RNA degradation machinery, contributing to the regulation of gene expression by ensuring that only properly processed RNA transcripts are translated into proteins. Its function is essential for preventing the accumulation of faulty RNA, which could otherwise lead to cellular dysfunction and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
