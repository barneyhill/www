# LRCH3

## Overview
The LRCH3 gene encodes the protein leucine-rich repeats and calponin homology domain containing 3, which is involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and immune responses. This protein is characterized by the presence of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and calponin homology (CH) domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and actin binding, respectively. The LRR domain is crucial for interactions with proteins such as DOCK7, while the CH domain is involved in binding to actin-stabilizing septin proteins, influencing cytoskeletal dynamics (Rivière2020Structure). Some isoforms of LRCH3 also contain a transmembrane domain, suggesting a role in sensing external stimuli (Rivière2020Structure). The protein is implicated in the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NFκB), a transcription factor essential for cell proliferation and survival, highlighting its significance in immune regulation and cellular integrity (McGovern2019Candidate; Rivière2020Structure).

## Structure
The LRCH3 protein is characterized by the presence of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and calponin homology (CH) domains. The LRR domain typically consists of nine LRRs, but in LRCH3, it contains 10 LRRs, forming a horseshoe-shaped, superhelical arrangement that facilitates a wide range of protein-protein interactions (Rivière2020Structure). The CH domain is involved in actin binding and is located at the C-terminus of the protein (Rivière2020Structure). 

LRCH3 also contains a transmembrane (TM) domain in some isoforms, suggesting a role in sensing external stimuli (Rivière2020Structure). The protein interacts with DOCK7 via its LRR domain, with myosin-6 through a region between the LRR and CH domains, and with actin-stabilizing septin proteins via the CH domain, which can induce septin delocalization from actin filaments (Rivière2020Structure). 

Post-transcriptionally, LRCH3 is promoted by the S1A-domain of SARS-CoV-2, forming a regulatory complex with DOCK7 and MYO6, which is involved in the regulation of septins (Nahalka2021Theoretical). The exact molecular structure of LRCH3, including its tertiary and quaternary structures, is not fully detailed in the available literature.

## Function
LRCH3 is a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in leukocyte biology. It contains leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and calponin homology (CH) domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and are implicated in actin binding (Rivière2020Structure). The LRR domain of LRCH3 is involved in interactions with DOCK7, a protein that plays a role in actin cytoskeleton dynamics, suggesting that LRCH3 contributes to cytoskeletal regulation by binding to actin-stabilizing septin proteins and inducing their delocalization from actin filaments (Rivière2020Structure).

LRCH3 is also linked to the activation of NFκB, a transcription factor crucial for cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. Knockdown studies have shown that reducing LRCH3 expression affects NFκB activation, indicating its role in regulating cell proliferation at the molecular level (Rivière2020Structure). The protein is active in various cellular compartments, contributing to cell structure and function, and is involved in processes such as cell division and development (Rivière2020Structure). These functions highlight LRCH3's importance in maintaining cellular integrity and responding to external stimuli, particularly in immune responses.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the LRCH3 gene have been implicated in various diseases. Genetic analyses have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in LRCH3 that are associated with increased susceptibility to infections in pigs and cows, suggesting a potential role in immune response regulation (Rivière2020Structure). In humans, gene amplifications of LRCH3 have been linked to tumorigenesis in melanomas, and its expression is notably increased in colorectal cancer tissues compared to healthy tissues (Rivière2020Structure). 

In the context of neurological disorders, a study on Caribbean-Hispanic families with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) identified an intronic variant in the LRCH3 gene, which showed the strongest association with LOAD, although the association was not statistically significant at conventional levels (Vardarajan2018Whole). 

Additionally, LRCH3 is involved in cell division and proliferation, with knockdown studies indicating its role in NFκB activation, a transcription factor important for cell proliferation and survival (Rivière2020Structure). Dysregulation of LRCH3 through circR-loops, a type of RNA-DNA interaction, has been shown to enhance its transcriptional activity, leading to apoptosis in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, indicating a potential regulatory role in disease mechanisms (Su2024CircRloop:).

## Interactions
LRCH3 is involved in various protein interactions that play a role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton and immune responses. It interacts with DOCK7 through its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions. This interaction suggests a potential LRCH-DOCK axis that may regulate actin cytoskeleton dynamics (Rivière2020Structure). LRCH3 also binds to myosin-6 via a region between the LRR and calponin homology (CH) domain, and to actin-stabilizing septin proteins through the CH domain. The interaction with septin proteins leads to their delocalization from actin filaments, indicating a role in cytoskeletal regulation (Rivière2020Structure).

Although LRCH3 is not known to directly bind F-actin, it likely influences the cytoskeleton through interactions with regulatory proteins (Rivière2020Structure). In immune responses, LRCH3 is implicated in the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NFκB), a transcription factor important for cell proliferation and survival, suggesting its involvement in cytokine production and immune regulation (McGovern2019Candidate; Rivière2020Structure). Despite these insights, specific physical interactions of LRCH3 with other proteins or nucleic acids remain to be fully elucidated (Rivière2020Structure).
