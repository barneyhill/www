# RGCC

## Overview
The RGCC gene, also known as Regulator of Cell Cycle or RGC-32, encodes a protein that is integral to the regulation of the cell cycle. This protein is involved in the activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), a key player in cell cycle progression, particularly at the G2/M checkpoint. RGCC is expressed in a variety of tissues and is implicated in numerous cellular processes, including angiogenesis, glucose homeostasis, and immune cell function. The RGCC protein acts as a substrate and regulator of CDC2 activity, and its phosphorylation is essential for stimulating CDC2 kinase activity, which is crucial for cell proliferation. It is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing processes such as cell division and DNA repair. Additionally, RGCC interacts with several proteins, including Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) and Akt, highlighting its role in cellular signaling pathways and its potential impact on cancer biology (Brocard2018Pumilio; Vlaicu2019RGC32).

## Structure


## Function
The RGCC gene, also known as RGC-32, encodes a protein that plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation. It is involved in the activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), which is crucial for cell cycle progression, particularly at the G2/M checkpoint (Brocard2018Pumilio). RGC-32 is expressed in various tissues and is implicated in several cellular processes, including angiogenesis, glucose homeostasis, macrophage phagocytosis, and T cell growth (Brocard2018Pumilio). 

In endothelial cells, RGC-32 is involved in cell cycle activation, migration, and the release of growth factors, which are essential for processes like atherogenesis (Vlaicu2019RGC32). It also plays a role in the differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells and macrophages, favoring the M2 macrophage phenotype, which is associated with anti-inflammatory responses (Vlaicu2019RGC32). 

RGC-32 is a substrate and regulator of CDC2 activity, and its phosphorylation is necessary for stimulating CDC2 kinase activity, which is important for cell proliferation (Vlaicu2019RGC32). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing processes such as cell division and DNA repair (Brocard2018Pumilio).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RGCC gene have been implicated in the progression and metastasis of various cancers. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), RGCC is highly expressed in lung metastases and is associated with poor prognosis. Its overexpression enhances the activity of PLK1 kinase, promoting lung metastasis by activating oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation, which are crucial for metastatic cell survival (Cheng2023RGCCmediated). Knockdown of RGCC in TNBC models has been shown to reduce lung metastasis and improve survival outcomes, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Cheng2023RGCCmediated).

RGCC is also involved in colorectal cancer, where it influences epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cytokine production, contributing to tumor progression (Liu2021A). In colon cancer, RGCC expression is higher in adenomas and advanced stages, and its knockdown affects chromatin assembly and cell cycle regulation, indicating its role in cancer development (Vlaicu2010Epigenetic). These findings highlight RGCC's significant role in cancer metastasis and progression, making it a potential biomarker and target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
RGCC (Regulator of Cell Cycle) is known to interact with several proteins, influencing various cellular processes. It binds directly to Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), enhancing its kinase activity. This interaction primarily occurs in the cytoplasm and involves the phosphorylation of PLK1 at T210, a critical site for its activity. The binding of RGCC to PLK1 stabilizes its active conformation, promoting its kinase function (Cheng2023RGCCmediated).

RGCC also interacts with cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) and Akt, playing a role in cell cycle progression and cellular signaling pathways. It is associated with centrosomes during mitosis, indicating its involvement in cell division (Liu2021A). The interaction with Akt is particularly significant in the context of P. gingivalis infection, where RGCC modulates the transcriptional activity of Zeb2 and the production of IL-6, a proinflammatory cytokine (Liu2021A).

These interactions highlight RGCC's role in regulating cell cycle progression, tumor cell proliferation, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), making it a critical player in cancer biology and a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Liu2021A; Cheng2023RGCCmediated).
