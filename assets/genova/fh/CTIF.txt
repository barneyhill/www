# CTIF

## Overview
The CTIF gene encodes the cap-binding complex dependent translation initiation factor, a pivotal protein involved in the initiation of mRNA translation in human cells. This protein functions as an adaptor, linking the nuclear cap-binding protein complex CBP80/20 with the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3), thereby facilitating the recruitment of ribosomes to mRNA. This process is essential for the pioneer round of translation, which is distinct from the standard translation pathway mediated by eIF4E, and plays a critical role in mRNA quality control mechanisms such as nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) (Choe2012Translation; Kim2009A). CTIF is primarily localized to the perinuclear region, indicating its involvement in translation processes near the nucleus (Kim2009A). The protein's interactions with CBP80 and eIF3 are stable even in the absence of RNA, underscoring its importance in maintaining efficient translation initiation (Choe2012Translation; Kim2009A). Additionally, CTIF has been implicated in clinical contexts, such as hearing function, where certain genetic variations in the CTIF gene are associated with altered hearing thresholds in children (Harrison2015Association).

## Function
CTIF (cap-binding complex dependent translation initiation factor) is a crucial protein involved in the initiation of mRNA translation in human cells. It functions by interacting with the nuclear cap-binding protein complex CBP80/20 and the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3), facilitating the recruitment of ribosomes to mRNA. This interaction is essential for the pioneer round of translation, a process distinct from the standard translation mediated by eIF4E, and is critical for the quality control of mRNA, including nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) (Choe2012Translation; Kim2009A).

CTIF acts as an adaptor protein, linking CBP80/20 with eIF3, and is involved in the translation of CBP80-bound mRNAs. It is localized primarily to the perinuclear region, suggesting its involvement in translation processes occurring near the nucleus (Kim2009A). The protein's interaction with CBP80 and eIF3 is stable even in the absence of RNA, indicating a strong association that is crucial for maintaining the association of CBP80 with polysomes and efficient translation initiation (Choe2012Translation; Kim2009A).

CTIF also plays a significant role in NMD, a surveillance mechanism that removes mRNAs containing premature termination codons. Down-regulation of CTIF disrupts this process, highlighting its importance in maintaining mRNA quality control (Choe2012Translation; Kim2009A).

## Clinical Significance
The CTIF gene, which encodes the cap binding complex dependent translation initiation factor, has been implicated in hearing function, particularly in children. Research has identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CTIF that are associated with altered hearing thresholds. For instance, the SNP rs12959910 in CTIF was found to have a near-significant association with high-frequency hearing in children, suggesting a potential detrimental effect on hearing function (Harrison2015Association). Another SNP, rs7233521, was correlated with poorer hearing function in females, as indicated by smaller amplitude otoacoustic emissions in the ALSPAC cohort (Harrison2015Association).

While these findings suggest a role for CTIF in hearing, the evidence is not conclusive, and the associations were not replicated in adult cohorts, indicating that the impact of CTIF on hearing may be age-dependent or influenced by other factors (Harrison2015Association). Additionally, CTIF is located within a quantitative trait locus associated with early-onset, low-frequency hearing loss in mice, although this frequency is not considered low for humans (Harrison2015Association). Further research is needed to confirm these associations and to explore the potential clinical significance of CTIF in hearing and other conditions.

## Interactions
CTIF (cap binding complex dependent translation initiation factor) is involved in several protein and nucleic acid interactions that are crucial for its role in translation initiation and mRNA surveillance. CTIF interacts directly with the nuclear cap-binding protein CBP80, forming part of the CBP80/20-dependent translation initiation complex. This interaction is stable even in the absence of RNA, as demonstrated by RNase A treatment, which removes RNA but does not disrupt the protein interactions (Kim2009A). CTIF also associates with eIF3 and eIF4AIII, and it preferentially binds to the exon junction complex (EJC)-bound CT initiation complex (Kim2009A).

CTIF does not interact with eIF4E or eIF4GI, indicating a specific role in translation initiation distinct from the steady-state translation complex (Kim2009A). It is also involved in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) by interacting with the NMD factor Upf3X (Kim2009A). CTIF's N-terminal domain is essential for its interaction with CBP80, as shown by GST pull-down assays (Kim2009A).

In the context of HIV-1, CTIF interacts with the viral protein Rev through its N-terminal CBP80-binding domain, inhibiting Gag synthesis by interfering with Rev's function and its interaction with CBP80 (GarcíadeGracia2020CBP8020dependent).
