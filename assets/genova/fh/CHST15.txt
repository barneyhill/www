# CHST15

## Overview
CHST15 is a gene that encodes the enzyme carbohydrate sulfotransferase 15, which is involved in the sulfation of chondroitin sulfate, a critical process in the modification of glycosaminoglycans. This enzyme is categorized as a sulfotransferase, a type of enzyme that transfers sulfate groups to various substrates. The activity of carbohydrate sulfotransferase 15 is significant in various biological processes, including cellular signaling and the modulation of the extracellular matrix. CHST15 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several cancers, such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, and clear cell renal cell carcinoma, where it influences tumor progression and metastasis through its interactions with other proteins and signaling pathways (Gui2021circCHST15; Liu2019Long; Chen2022CHST15). Additionally, mutations in the CHST15 gene are associated with familial myeloproliferative neoplasms, highlighting its clinical significance in hematological disorders (Chen2022CHST15).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CHST15 gene are associated with familial myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), a group of disorders characterized by the overproduction of blood cells. These mutations are linked to an increased risk of disease transformation to acute myeloid leukemia or accelerated primary myelofibrosis (PMF). The CHST15 mutation cooperates with the JAK2 V617F mutation, enhancing the MPN phenotype by increasing the JAK2V617F allele burden and activating p-STAT3 signaling. This results in increased proliferative activity and differentiation of myeloid, monocytic, and megakaryocytic lineages, mimicking PMF or essential thrombocythemia (Chen2022CHST15).

In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), circCHST15, a circular RNA derived from the CHST15 gene, is upregulated and promotes tumor growth and metastasis. It acts as a miRNA sponge, influencing the miR-125a-5p/EIF4EBP1 axis, which is involved in cell proliferation and migration. High circCHST15 expression is associated with poor prognosis, advanced tumor stage, and grade in ccRCC patients (Gui2021circCHST15).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), strong CHST15 expression is linked to earlier recurrence and decreased overall survival, suggesting its role as a prognostic marker for disease-free and overall survival in PDA patients (Ito2017Prognostic).

## Interactions
CHST15, a carbohydrate sulfotransferase, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In familial myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), CHST15 interacts with the JAK2 protein. This interaction is significant in the context of MPN pathogenesis, as it forms part of a CHST15/JAK2/p-Stat3 signaling axis. The interaction between CHST15 and JAK2 was confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation experiments and immunofluorescence imaging, showing that the JAK2/CHST15 complex is primarily localized on the inner side of the cell membrane in cells expressing the CHST15 mutant (Chen2022CHST15).

In breast cancer, CHST15 is regulated by the long noncoding RNA HOTAIR, which enhances CHST15 expression. This regulation is crucial for HOTAIR-mediated invasiveness in breast cancer cells. CHST15 catalyzes the sulfation of chondroitin sulfate, forming the CS-E isoform, which is linked to increased invasiveness of cancer cells. The HOTAIR-CHST15 axis is implicated in tumor progression, with CHST15 playing a significant role in modulating the extracellular environment and promoting cancer cell invasiveness (Liu2019Long).

In prostate cancer, CHST15 expression is influenced by non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways, involving Rac-1 GTPase and phospho-p38 MAPK, which affect GATA-3. This pathway leads to increased CHST15 expression, highlighting its role in cancer progression (Bhattacharyya2020Increased).
