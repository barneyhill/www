# SVIL

## Overview
The SVIL gene encodes the protein supervillin, a cytoskeletal protein that plays a significant role in cellular processes such as motility, cytokinesis, and membrane dynamics. Supervillin is characterized by its ability to bind actin filaments and interact with various proteins involved in cell division and motility, including myosin II and EPLIN. It is involved in organizing the actin cytoskeleton and linking it to the plasma membrane, which influences cell shape and movement. The protein undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms, including a muscle-specific variant known as archvillin, which is primarily expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Supervillin's interactions and functions are modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation. Clinically, mutations in the SVIL gene have been associated with conditions such as myopathy and cardiovascular diseases, and its expression levels have prognostic implications in certain cancers (Wulfkuhle1999Domain; Oh2003Archvillin; Nie2023Duality; HedbergOldfors2020Loss; Smith2010Novel).

## Structure
Supervillin (SVIL) is a large cytoskeletal protein with a complex molecular structure. It is characterized by a bipartite structure comprising distinct amino and carboxy-terminal domains. The amino terminus is involved in F-actin binding and nuclear localization, while the carboxy-terminal domain shares extensive similarity with the gelsolin family of actin-binding proteins, suggesting potential actin filament bundling and capping activities (Wulfkuhle1999Domain). The carboxy-terminal domain contains sequences similar to those in gelsolin and villin, which are known for actin filament interactions (Wulfkuhle1999Domain).

The protein's C-terminus is modeled with supervillin-specific loops extending from gelsolin-like repeats and a villin-like headpiece, although it lacks certain residues that bind, cap, and sever actin filaments (Smith2010Novel). Supervillin's N-terminus contains functional nuclear localization signals and is crucial for F-actin bundling and targeting to focal adhesions and stress fibers (Wulfkuhle1999Domain).

Supervillin undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms, including a muscle-specific isoform known as archvillin. Archvillin contains muscle-specific sequences and nuclear targeting signals, and is primarily expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle (Oh2003Archvillin). The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its interactions and cellular functions (Smith2010Novel).

## Function
Supervillin (SVIL) is a cytoskeletal protein that plays a crucial role in cell motility and cytokinesis. It is involved in organizing actin filaments and linking the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane, which influences cell shape and movement (Wulfkuhle1999Domain; Smith2010Novel). Supervillin is active in the cytoplasm and at the cell periphery, contributing to processes such as muscle contraction and cell adhesion (Wulfkuhle1999Domain).

In cell division, supervillin is essential for cytokinesis, particularly during the early stages. It interacts with proteins like myosin II, EPLIN, and KIF14, coordinating the activation of myosin II and the attachment of the contractile apparatus to the membrane (Smith2013Supervillin; Smith2010Novel). Supervillin acts as a scaffold, potentially bridging myosin II with septins through EPLIN, and works in parallel with other scaffolds like anillin (Smith2010Novel). Its interaction with ERK3 and phosphorylation on Ser245 is necessary for the normal completion of cytokinesis, highlighting its role in maintaining cell ploidy (Javary2022Phosphoproteomic).

Supervillin also plays a role in membrane dynamics, promoting integrin recycling and being associated with lipid rafts, which are crucial for cell motility and division (Smith2010Novel). Its depletion leads to cytokinesis failure, resulting in increased numbers of binucleated and multinucleated cells (Smith2013Supervillin; Smith2010Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SVIL gene, which encodes the protein supervillin, have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In the context of cancer, SVIL expression is notably downregulated in bladder cancer tissues compared to normal tissues. However, paradoxically, higher SVIL expression within these cancerous tissues is associated with poorer clinicopathological features and outcomes, such as overall survival, disease-free survival, and disease-specific survival. This suggests that SVIL could serve as an independent prognostic factor for bladder cancer (Nie2023Duality).

SVIL is also implicated in myopathy, a muscle disorder characterized by myofibrillar disorganization and autophagic vacuoles. Studies have identified homozygous loss-of-function mutations in the SVIL gene in affected individuals, leading to muscle weakness, fatigue, and structural myopathy. These mutations result in the absence of the supervillin protein, disrupting muscle integrity and function (HedbergOldfors2020Loss).

In cardiovascular diseases, SVIL has been associated with heart failure and nonischemic cardiomyopathy. SVIL deficiency in heart muscle cells leads to increased cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, apoptosis, and impaired cell viability, suggesting its crucial role in maintaining cardiac function (Li2024Genomewide).

## Interactions
Supervillin (SVIL) is a cytoskeletal protein that interacts with various proteins, playing a crucial role in cell division and motility. It binds to myosin II, a motor protein essential for muscle contraction and cytokinesis, and acts synergistically with anillin to ensure proper cytokinesis. Supervillin and anillin do not interact directly but both bind to the myosin heavy chain (MHC) and F-actin, coordinating myosin II recruitment and activation during cell division (Smith2013Supervillin).

Supervillin also interacts with proteins involved in the central spindle assembly, such as KIF14 and potentially PRC1, suggesting a role in linking the cortex with central spindle components (Smith2013Supervillin). It binds to L-MLCK, a kinase involved in myosin II regulation, and EPLIN/LIMA1, another cytokinetic regulator (Smith2013Supervillin).

In addition to its role in cytokinesis, supervillin is involved in actin cytoskeleton organization. It associates with F-actin and vinculin at focal adhesion sites, influencing cell adhesion and motility. Overexpression of supervillin can disrupt focal adhesion plaques and increase F-actin and vinculin levels, indicating its role in actin filament bundling and cytoskeletal reorganization (Wulfkuhle1999Domain).
