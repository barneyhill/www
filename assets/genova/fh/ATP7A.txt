# ATP7A

## Overview
ATP7A is a gene that encodes the ATPase copper transporting alpha protein, a crucial component in the regulation of copper homeostasis within human cells. This protein is categorized as a P-type ATPase, which is a class of transmembrane proteins involved in the active transport of ions across cellular membranes. ATP7A plays a vital role in the incorporation of copper into essential enzymes and the maintenance of copper balance by facilitating its efflux from cells when intracellular levels are elevated. The protein's function is critical for various physiological processes, including neurodevelopment, angiogenesis, and the regulation of blood pressure. Mutations in the ATP7A gene are linked to several disorders, such as Menkes disease and occipital horn syndrome, which are characterized by defects in copper metabolism and associated clinical manifestations (La2010Mammalian; Tümer2013An).

## Structure
The ATP7A protein is a copper-transporting P-type ATPase that plays a crucial role in copper homeostasis. Structurally, ATP7A belongs to the P-type ATPase family and features several functional domains, including six heavy metal-associated domains (HMA), an E1-E2 ATPase domain, a HAD-like hydrolase domain, and an ATPase IB-1 domain (Mhaske2020ATP7A). The protein's primary structure includes transmembrane domains and ATP-binding sites, which are essential for its function in copper transport.

The secondary structure of ATP7A is characterized by alpha helices and beta sheets, forming a complex tertiary structure that includes functional domains such as the actuator, phosphorylation, and nucleotide-binding domains. A unique feature of ATP7A is the presence of a seventh metastable domain, HMA1A, located between the first two metal-binding domains (MBD1 and MBD2). This domain exhibits a babba-fold similar to the ferredoxin archetype but lacks a copper-binding site (Uhlemann2021At).

Post-translational modifications of ATP7A include phosphorylation and glycosylation, which may affect its function and localization. ATP7A also has multiple splice variant isoforms, which can influence its activity and cellular distribution (Mhaske2020ATP7A). The protein's quaternary structure involves interactions between its domains, contributing to its dynamic regulation and function in copper transport.

## Function
The ATP7A gene encodes a copper-transporting ATPase that plays a crucial role in maintaining copper homeostasis in human cells. This protein is primarily located at the trans-Golgi network (TGN), where it facilitates the incorporation of copper into copper-dependent enzymes, such as lysyl oxidase, tyrosinase, and peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase (La2010Mammalian; Lenartowicz2016MetalDependent). ATP7A is involved in the ATP-dependent translocation of copper ions across cellular membranes, ensuring that copper is available for essential biosynthetic and protective functions while preventing toxic accumulation (La2010Mammalian).

In response to elevated intracellular copper levels, ATP7A relocates from the TGN to vesicular compartments near the cell periphery, facilitating copper efflux to maintain cellular copper balance (La2007Trafficking). This trafficking is regulated by copper-binding and other signals, which influence its intracellular location and activity (La2010Mammalian). In polarized epithelial cells, such as those in the intestine and kidney, ATP7A mediates vectorial copper transport across the basolateral membrane, playing a key role in dietary copper absorption and renal copper reabsorption (La2007Trafficking; La2010Mammalian).

In the central nervous system, ATP7A is involved in processes such as axon extension, synaptogenesis, and myelination, and it modulates NMDA receptor activity through copper release, which is important for learning and memory (Telianidis2013Role). The protein's function is critical for normal cellular and physiological processes, including angiogenesis and the regulation of blood pressure through the activation of extracellular superoxide dismutase 3 (SOD3) (La2010Mammalian).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATP7A gene are associated with several distinct disorders, primarily affecting copper metabolism. Menkes disease is a severe X-linked recessive disorder caused by mutations in ATP7A, leading to copper deficiency. This results in progressive neurodegeneration, connective tissue abnormalities, and distinctive 'kinky' hair, often resulting in early childhood mortality (Donsante2007Differences; Tümer2013An). Occipital horn syndrome (OHS) is a milder form of Menkes disease, characterized by connective tissue disorders such as occipital exostosis and joint laxity, with patients often having slightly below-normal serum copper levels (Kaler2011ATP7Arelated; Gu2001ATP7A).

A novel phenotype associated with ATP7A mutations is distal motor neuropathy, which presents as late-onset distal muscular atrophy with minimal sensory symptoms. This condition is linked to specific missense mutations that affect intracellular trafficking and copper transport, leading to motor neuron disease phenotypes (Kennerson2010Missense; Kaler2011ATP7Arelated). The variability in clinical outcomes among patients with ATP7A mutations is influenced by the type of mutation and other genetic or environmental factors, with females generally experiencing milder symptoms due to X-inactivation patterns (Tümer2013An).

## Interactions
ATP7A, a copper-transporting ATPase, engages in several critical protein interactions that influence its function and localization within cells. It interacts with adaptor protein complexes AP-1 and AP-2, which are essential for its intracellular trafficking. These interactions are mediated by the carboxyl-terminal tail of ATP7A, which contains a di-leucine motif crucial for binding these adaptor proteins. The interaction with AP-1 is involved in anterograde trafficking, tethering ATP7A at the trans-Golgi network (TGN), while AP-2 is implicated in retrograde trafficking, facilitating endocytic retrieval from the plasma membrane (Yi2015Direct).

Mutations in ATP7A, such as P1386S, can disrupt these interactions, leading to mislocalization and altered cellular functions, which are associated with neurological disorders (Yi2015Direct). ATP7A also interacts with the COG complex, a Golgi-localized tethering complex, which is important for its trafficking and copper homeostasis. The absence of the COG complex results in decreased ATP7A levels and impaired copper transport (Comstra2017The).

Additionally, ATP7A is part of a broader interactome involving 541 proteins, including known trafficking proteins and novel factors like VAC14 and the WASH complex, highlighting its role in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative pathways (Comstra2017The).
