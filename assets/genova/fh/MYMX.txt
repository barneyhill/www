# MYMX

## Overview
The MYMX gene encodes the protein myomixer, a small fusogenic micropeptide integral to muscle development. Myomixer is characterized by its N-terminal transmembrane segment and a conserved AxLyCxL motif, which are essential for its role in facilitating myoblast fusion. This protein operates at the cell membrane, where it collaborates with Myomaker, another fusogenic protein, to promote the fusion of myoblasts into multinucleated myotubes, a critical step in muscle fiber formation (Zhang2020Human; RamirezMartinez2022Impaired). Myomixer's expression is tightly regulated during myogenesis, and its activity is crucial for effective muscle development and regeneration. Mutations in the MYMX gene, such as the R46* variant, have been associated with myopathies resembling Carey-Fineman-Ziter syndrome, underscoring its clinical significance in muscle-related disorders (RamirezMartinez2022Impaired).

## Structure
The MYMX protein, also known as myomixer, is a small fusogenic micropeptide composed of 84 amino acids. Its primary structure includes an N-terminal transmembrane hydrophobic segment, which serves as a membrane anchor, followed by a positively charged extracellular segment and a shorter hydrophobic segment containing a conserved AxLyCxL motif essential for myoblast fusion (Bi2017Control; RamirezMartinez2022Impaired). In mammals, MYMX also features a hydrophilic C-terminal segment, which is absent in fish and turtle orthologs (RamirezMartinez2022Impaired).

The secondary structure of MYMX includes alpha-helical regions, with the N-terminal alpha-helix long enough to span the bilayer, indicating its role as an integral membrane protein (Leikina2018Myomaker). The tertiary structure is not detailed in the available literature, and there is no information on quaternary structure or post-translational modifications.

The MYMX protein is crucial for muscle development, as it promotes myoblast fusion by interacting with the plasma membrane to facilitate fusion pore formation. The R46* variant of MYMX, which results in a truncated protein lacking the AxLyCxL motif, leads to impaired fusogenic activity and is associated with a CFZS-like phenotype (RamirezMartinez2022Impaired).

## Function
MYMX, also known as myomixer, is a crucial protein involved in the fusion of myoblasts, which is essential for muscle development and regeneration in humans. MYMX operates at the cell membrane, where it facilitates the merging of myoblasts into multinucleated myotubes, a critical step in forming functional muscle fibers (Zhang2020Human; Yang2022LncRNA). This protein works in conjunction with Myomaker, another fusogenic protein, to enhance the efficiency of myoblast fusion. While Myomaker is required on both sides of the fusing cells, MYMX significantly boosts the fusion process, even when present on only one side (Zhang2020Human).

MYMX expression is tightly regulated during myogenesis, with its mRNA levels peaking early in differentiation and declining as the process progresses (Yang2022LncRNA). The regulation of MYMX is influenced by the long noncoding RNA OIP5-AS1, which promotes the degradation of miR-7, a microRNA that represses MYMX production. This interaction ensures adequate MYMX levels for effective myoblast fusion (Yang2022LncRNA). The absence of MYMX leads to reduced myotube formation, highlighting its essential role in muscle fiber development (Yang2022LncRNA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MYMX gene, particularly the R46* variant, have been linked to a myopathy resembling Carey-Fineman-Ziter syndrome (CFZS). This variant results in a premature stop codon, leading to the loss of a conserved extracellular hydrophobic domain crucial for the protein's fusogenic activity. The MYMX R46* mutation impairs myoblast fusion, causing muscle abnormalities and neonatal lethality in mice models, which supports its role in CFZS-like myopathy (RamirezMartinez2022Impaired). The study of patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with this mutation revealed defective myoblast fusion, highlighting the clinical significance of MYMX in muscle development disorders (RamirezMartinez2022Impaired).

Alterations in MYMX expression levels also impact muscle development. The long non-coding RNA OIP5-AS1 regulates MYMX by degrading miR-7, which otherwise suppresses MYMX expression. This regulation is crucial for myogenesis, as MYMX is essential for myotube formation. Disruption in this regulatory pathway, such as through the use of target site blockers that prevent miR-7 degradation, leads to reduced MYMX levels and impaired muscle cell fusion, suggesting potential implications for muscle regeneration and related disorders (Yang2022LncRNA). These findings underscore the importance of MYMX in maintaining normal muscle function and its potential involvement in neuromuscular diseases.

## Interactions
Myomixer (MYMX) is a crucial protein involved in myoblast fusion, a key process in muscle development. It interacts with Myomaker (MYMK), a 7-pass transmembrane protein, to facilitate the fusion of myoblasts into multinucleated muscle fibers. Myomixer is required on one of the two fusing cells, while Myomaker is necessary on both, highlighting their complementary roles in the fusion process (Zhang2020Human; Lehka2020Mechanisms).

The interaction between Myomixer and Myomaker is essential for the formation of myotubes, with Myomixer enhancing the efficiency of fusion when present on both sides of the fusion process (Zhang2020Human). Myomixer's role is further emphasized by its regulation through the transcription factor MyoD, which binds to E-box motifs on the promoters of MYMX and MYMK, directly activating their transcription. This regulatory mechanism ensures the specific and timely expression of Myomixer and Myomaker, which is vital for proper myogenesis (Zhang2020Human).

The MYMX gene encodes a micropeptide that contains an N-terminal transmembrane segment and a hydrophilic C-terminal segment. Its extracellular hydrophobic domain, including a conserved AxLyCxL motif, is crucial for its fusogenic activity (RamirezMartinez2022Impaired).
