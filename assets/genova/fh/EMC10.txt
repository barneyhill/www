# EMC10

## Overview
EMC10 is a gene that encodes the ER membrane protein complex subunit 10, a component of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein complex (EMC). The EMC is integral to the biogenesis and homeostasis of membrane proteins, facilitating the insertion and folding of transmembrane domains (TMDs) essential for cellular function. EMC10, as part of this complex, is involved in protein-protein interactions within the large lumenal domain, although its specific role remains to be fully elucidated. The protein is suggested to be peripherally located within the EMC structure, indicating a supportive function in maintaining the complex's integrity. Mutations in EMC10 have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and metabolic conditions, highlighting its clinical significance (Kaiyrzhanov2022Biallelic; Hegde2022The; Page2023Role; Wang2022Secreted).

## Function
EMC10 is a component of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein complex (EMC), which plays a crucial role in the biogenesis and homeostasis of membrane proteins. The EMC is involved in the insertion and folding of transmembrane domains (TMDs) of various proteins, including those with multiple TMDs, which are essential for proper protein function and cellular homeostasis (Hegde2022The; Page2023Role). EMC10 is part of the large lumenal domain of the EMC, which includes other subunits like EMC1 and EMC7. This domain is thought to facilitate protein-protein interactions, although the specific function of EMC10 within this domain is not fully detailed (Page2023Role).

EMC10 is suggested to be peripherally located within the EMC structure, and its deletion does not significantly impact the overall structure of the complex, indicating a potentially supportive role (Hegde2022The). While the precise molecular activities of EMC10 in healthy human cells are not explicitly described, its association with the EMC suggests it contributes to the complex's role in protein insertion and stabilization within the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (Hegde2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EMC10 gene have been linked to a range of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including intellectual disability (ID) and global developmental delay (GDD). Biallelic loss-of-function variants in EMC10 are associated with clinical features such as facial dysmorphism, seizures, microcephaly, and corpus callosum thinning. These mutations can lead to a spectrum of symptoms, from mild to severe intellectual disability, and may include movement disorders and brain atrophy, suggesting potential neurodegeneration (Kaiyrzhanov2022Biallelic).

A specific frameshift variant, EMC10 c.287delG, has been identified in individuals from consanguineous families, leading to a syndrome characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, and dysmorphic features. This variant results in significantly reduced EMC10 RNA expression and an unstable truncated protein, indicating a loss-of-function mutation (Shao2021A).

Alterations in EMC10 expression are also implicated in metabolic conditions. The secreted isoform of EMC10 is upregulated in human obesity and is associated with insulin resistance. In mice, EMC10 knockout leads to resistance to diet-induced obesity, while overexpression promotes obesity, suggesting its role as a regulator of energy balance (Wang2022Secreted).

## Interactions
EMC10 is a component of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein complex (EMC), which plays a role in the biogenesis of transmembrane proteins. Within the EMC, EMC10 forms beta-sandwich domains alongside EMC7, positioned on either side of the membrane-proximal beta-propeller of EMC1. These interactions are crucial for the structural integrity of the complex, as the absence of EMC7 leads to the loss of EMC10 from the complex, while other EMC components remain unaffected (MillerVedam2020Structural). 

EMC10 is suggested to be part of a dynamic subdomain within the EMC, potentially interacting with other subunits such as EMC3, EMC4, and EMC7. Although its exact position has not been visualized, it is thought to be peripherally located, as its deletion does not impact the remainder of the EMC (Hegde2022The). 

The hydrophilic vestibule of EMC3, a core component of the EMC, is partially occluded by subunits including EMC10, indicating a possible regulatory role in the access to the insertase module of EMC3 (Hegde2021The). However, the precise mechanisms of these interactions and their functional implications require further investigation.
