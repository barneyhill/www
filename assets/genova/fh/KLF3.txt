# KLF3

## Overview
KLF3, or Krüppel-like factor 3, is a gene that encodes a zinc finger transcription factor involved in the regulation of gene expression. The protein product, KLF transcription factor 3, is characterized by its three C2H2 zinc finger domains, which facilitate specific binding to DNA sequences such as CACCC boxes and GC-rich motifs. As a transcriptional repressor, KLF3 plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including cell differentiation, development, and erythropoiesis, by modulating the expression of target genes. It interacts with co-repressors like the C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) to form complexes that mediate transcriptional repression. KLF3's activity is significant in maintaining cellular homeostasis and has implications in pathological conditions, including cancer, where its expression levels can influence tumor progression and metastasis (Pearson2011The; Jones2020KLF3; Dewi2015Phosphorylation).

## Structure
KLF3, also known as basic Krüppel-like factor (BKLF), is a transcription factor characterized by its three C-terminal C2H2 zinc finger domains, which are crucial for DNA binding. These zinc fingers are highly conserved and enable KLF3 to bind specifically to CACCC boxes and GC-rich motifs in the promoters and enhancers of target genes (Pearson2011The; Swamynathan2010Krüppellike). The zinc finger domains consist of two antiparallel beta-sheets and an alpha-helix, stabilized by a zinc ion, with the alpha-helix contacting the major groove of DNA (Pearson2011The).

The N-terminal region of KLF3 is proline-rich and contains a repression domain within the first 75 amino acids, which is essential for interaction with the transcriptional corepressor CtBP (Pearson2011The). This region includes a conserved PVDL(S/T) motif, which functions as a repression motif (Chen2010Porcine). KLF3 undergoes post-translational modifications such as sumoylation, which is important for its repressor activity, although it does not affect DNA binding or cellular localization (Pearson2011The).

KLF3 can form complexes with other proteins, such as CtBP and FHL3, to mediate gene repression, suggesting a role in various cellular processes, including adipogenesis and erythropoiesis (Pearson2011The; Swamynathan2010Krüppellike).

## Function
KLF3 (Kruppel-like factor 3) is a transcription factor that primarily functions as a transcriptional repressor in healthy human cells. It is involved in various molecular processes, including the regulation of gene expression during cell differentiation and development. KLF3 exerts its repressive function by binding to specific DNA sequences, such as CACCC boxes and GC-rich motifs, and recruiting co-repressors like the C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) to form a silencing complex that mediates transcriptional repression (Pearson2011The; Dewi2015Phosphorylation).

In the context of epidermal differentiation, KLF3 is upregulated and plays a crucial role in promoting the expression of differentiation genes while suppressing genes associated with cell proliferation. This activity is essential for maintaining the integrity of the epidermis and ensuring proper skin health (Jones2020KLF3). KLF3 also participates in erythropoiesis, where it fine-tunes gene expression by repressing genes activated by KLF1, thereby ensuring proper maturation and function of red blood cells (Funnell2012The; Ilsley2017Krüppel-like).

KLF3 is active in the nucleus, where it influences various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, by modulating the transcription of target genes (Dewi2015Phosphorylation).

## Clinical Significance
KLF3 (KLF transcription factor 3) plays a significant role in various cancers due to its function as a transcriptional repressor. In sarcomas, KLF3 acts as a suppressor of miR-182, a microRNA associated with metastasis. Reduced expression of KLF3 correlates with increased miR-182 levels, contributing to enhanced metastatic potential in sarcomas (Sachdeva2015Epigenetic). In colorectal cancer, KLF3 expression is inversely correlated with aggressive cancer phenotypes, such as lymph node metastasis and lymphovascular invasion, suggesting it serves as a protective biomarker. Lower KLF3 levels are associated with poorer survival outcomes, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Wang2017RNA).

In lung cancer, KLF3 is downregulated, and its reduced expression is linked to advanced tumor stages and metastasis. KLF3 regulates STAT3 expression, and its knockdown promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition, enhancing cancer cell migration and invasion (Sun2019KLF3). In pancreatic cancer, miR-324-5p targets KLF3, leading to increased cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis, highlighting the role of KLF3 in tumor suppression (Wan2020miR3245p). These findings underscore the importance of KLF3 in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
KLF3, also known as Krüppel-like factor 3, is a transcription factor that participates in various protein-protein interactions, influencing its role as a transcriptional repressor. KLF3 interacts with the co-repressor C-terminal-binding protein 2 (CtBP2) to repress transcription. This interaction is facilitated by a specific amino acid motif (PVDLT) in KLF3, although some repression persists even when this motif is mutated, indicating the involvement of additional cofactors (Turner2003The).

KLF3 also interacts with the LIM protein FHL3, forming a complex with CtBP2 in the nucleus. This complex is approximately 240 kDa and is not present in the cytoplasm, suggesting a specific nuclear role. FHL3, traditionally known as a co-activator, acts as a transcriptional repressor in this context, enhancing BKLF-mediated repression of GATA-1 activated promoters (Turner2003The).

Additionally, KLF3 is phosphorylated by homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2), which enhances its DNA binding and transcriptional repression capabilities. HIPK2 phosphorylation of KLF3 at serine 249 strengthens its interaction with CtBP2, further increasing its repressive activity (Dewi2015Phosphorylation). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms involving KLF3 in transcriptional repression.
