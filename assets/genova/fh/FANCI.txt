# FANCI

## Overview
FANCI is a gene that encodes the FA complementation group I protein, a crucial component of the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway. This pathway is essential for maintaining genomic stability by repairing DNA interstrand crosslinks and other forms of DNA damage. The FA complementation group I protein, often referred to as FANCI, forms a heterodimer with FANCD2, known as the ID complex, which is central to the FA signaling network. This complex undergoes monoubiquitination, a modification critical for its activation and function in DNA repair processes, including homologous recombination and nucleotide excision repair. The FANCI protein is characterized by its complex molecular structure, including a DNA binding domain and a leucine zipper domain, and is predominantly composed of α-helices forming α solenoids. Mutations in the FANCI gene are linked to Fanconi anemia, a genetic disorder marked by bone marrow failure and increased cancer risk, as well as other cancer predispositions (Fierheller2023Molecular; Colnaghi2011Patientderived; Zhan2021Focal).

## Structure
The FANCI protein is a key component of the Fanconi anemia DNA repair pathway, characterized by a complex molecular structure. Its primary structure includes 1328 amino acids, with significant regions such as a DNA binding domain spanning residues 200-1000 and a leucine zipper domain at the N-terminus (residues 130-151) (Yuan2009FANCI; Fierheller2023Molecular). The protein is rich in leucine, comprising 14.8% of its composition, which contributes to its structural motifs like ARM repeats and a conserved C-terminal EDGE motif (Yuan2009FANCI).

The secondary structure of FANCI predominantly consists of α-helices, forming α-α superhelical segments known as α solenoids (Joo2011Structure). These solenoids facilitate protein-protein interactions and DNA binding. The tertiary structure is described as a saxophone-like shape, with a long N-terminal neck, a U-shaped middle bow, and a bulbous C-terminal bell (Joo2011Structure).

In terms of quaternary structure, FANCI forms a heterodimer with FANCD2, known as the ID complex, which is crucial for DNA repair. This complex preferentially binds to branched DNA structures (Yuan2009FANCI). Post-translational modifications include monoubiquitination at lysine 523 and phosphorylation at specific sites, which are essential for its function in DNA repair pathways (Yuan2009FANCI; Joo2011Structure).

## Function
The FANCI gene encodes a protein that is integral to the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway, which is crucial for maintaining genomic stability in healthy human cells. FANCI forms a heterodimer with FANCD2, known as the ID complex, which is central to the FA signaling network. This complex undergoes monoubiquitination, a critical modification that activates FA signaling, particularly during DNA replication or in response to DNA damage (Zhan2021Focal; Ishiai2021Regulation). The monoubiquitinated ID complex localizes to sites of DNA damage, facilitating the recruitment of other DNA repair proteins and participating in various repair mechanisms, including homologous recombination and nucleotide excision repair (Zhan2021Focal; Ishiai2021Regulation).

FANCI also plays a role in maintaining common fragile sites and resolving R-loops, structures that can threaten genome stability (Ishiai2021Regulation). The protein is active in the nucleus, particularly during the S phase of the cell cycle, where it helps stabilize replication forks and protect nascent DNA from degradation (Tan2020Monoubiquitination). Dysfunction in FANCI can lead to genomic instability, increasing the risk of cancer and bone marrow failure (Zhan2021Focal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FANCI gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily due to its role in the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway. Fanconi anemia is a rare genetic disorder characterized by bone marrow failure, developmental abnormalities, and an increased risk of cancer. Mutations in FANCI can lead to defects in DNA repair processes, contributing to the molecular pathogenesis of FA. For instance, a patient-derived mutation resulting in the deletion of the last 30 residues of the FANCI protein affects its nuclear localization and the monoubiquitination of FANCD2, a critical process in the FA pathway (Colnaghi2011Patientderived).

In addition to FA, alterations in FANCI have been implicated in cancer predisposition. The FANCI c.1813C>T variant has been identified in various cancers, including high-grade serous carcinoma and ovarian cancer, suggesting a potential role in tumorigenesis. This variant is associated with a higher mutational load and microsatellite instability in tumors, indicating its involvement in cancer risk (Fierheller2023Molecular). The FANCI gene's interaction with DNA-damaging agents like cisplatin and mitomycin C also presents opportunities for cancer treatment research (Fierheller2023Molecular).

## Interactions
FANCI is a key component of the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway, primarily interacting with FANCD2 to form the FANCI-FANCD2 (ID) complex. This complex is essential for the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) and is activated through monoubiquitination, a process regulated by the FA core complex and the USP1:UAF1 deubiquitinase enzyme (Colnaghi2011Patientderived; van2017Mechanism). FANCI's interaction with FANCD2 is crucial for its function, and this interaction is modulated by phosphorylation at specific serine residues, which enhances the complex's affinity for DNA and promotes monoubiquitination (Tan2020ATRMediated).

FANCI also interacts with other proteins involved in DNA repair and cellular processes. It binds with the proapoptotic factor PIDD1, forming the PIDDosome complex, which is involved in apoptotic signaling (Zhan2021Focal). FANCI interacts with RAD51, stimulating D-loop formation important for meiotic recombination, and with ribosomal protein S27-like (RPS27L), which prevents its degradation via the autophagy-lysosome system (Zhan2021Focal). Additionally, FANCI interacts with the USP1-UAF1 complex, which is crucial for the deubiquitination of the FANCI-FANCD2 complex, and this interaction is influenced by FANCI's phosphorylation state (Rennie2021Structural).
