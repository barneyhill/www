# OR4E2

## Overview
The OR4E2 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily E member 2, a protein that belongs to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This receptor is primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a significant role in the olfactory system by binding specific odorants and initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell (Matiashova2023The). The OR4E2 protein is particularly noted for its interaction with the MAYDRY domain and its natural agonist, amyl acetate, which suggests its involvement in specific odorant recognition and potential influence on dietary choices and metabolic health (Matiashova2023The). Beyond its olfactory functions, OR4E2 has been implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including gestational hypothyroidism, preeclampsia, and cancer, highlighting its broader significance in human health and disease (Park2023Comprehensive; Hirata2023Exploring).

## Function
The OR4E2 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules. These receptors are primarily located in the olfactory epithelium, where they bind specific odorants, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell (Matiashova2023The). The OR4E2 receptor is involved in detecting the MAYDRY domain, with amyl acetate identified as its natural agonist, suggesting its role in specific odorant recognition and influencing dietary choices and metabolic health (Matiashova2023The).

In addition to its role in olfactory perception, OR4E2 has been studied in the context of gestational hypothyroidism and preeclampsia, where its expression levels were found to correlate with these conditions. The receptor's expression is negatively correlated with Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) levels, indicating a potential link to metabolic processes and health outcomes (Hirata2023Exploring). The expression pattern of OR4E2 in the olfactory epithelium of higher primates, such as macaques, is similar to that in humans, suggesting a conserved mechanism of olfactory receptor gene expression across species (Horowitz2014Olfactory).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the OR4E2 gene have been associated with several medical conditions. In the context of gestational hypothyroidism and preeclampsia, OR4E2 expression is notably downregulated. This downregulation is linked to hypertension and endothelial dysfunction, potentially due to impaired calcium signaling, which may contribute to the development of preeclampsia (Hirata2023Exploring). The study suggests that OR4E2, along with other olfactory receptors, could serve as biomarkers for predicting preeclampsia, with low expression levels indicating an increased risk (Hirata2023Exploring).

In cancer research, OR4E2 is highlighted as part of the olfactory receptor family that plays a crucial role in cancer cell growth and progression, particularly in colorectal cancer. The OR family, including OR4E2, is implicated in promoting invasiveness and metastasis, as well as in apoptosis and reducing cell migration and proliferation in colorectal cancer cells (Park2023Comprehensive).

Additionally, differences in DNA methylation of OR4E2 have been observed in monozygotic twins with van der Woude syndrome, suggesting that epigenetic modifications of this gene may contribute to phenotypic variability in this condition (Petrin2023DNA).
