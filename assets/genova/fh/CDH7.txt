# CDH7

## Overview
CDH7 is a gene that encodes the protein cadherin 7, which is a member of the cadherin superfamily, specifically categorized as a type II classical cadherin. Cadherin 7 is a transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion, a fundamental process in maintaining the structural integrity of tissues. The protein is characterized by its extracellular cadherin (EC) domains, which facilitate homophilic binding interactions essential for its adhesive properties (Liu2007Cloning; Takahashi2008Expression). These interactions are mediated by the protein's ability to bind calcium ions, which stabilize the cadherin structure and enhance its adhesive function (Angst2001The). The gene's expression and the resulting protein's function are significant in various developmental and physiological processes, with potential implications in pathological conditions (Sotomayor2014Sorting).

## Structure
Cadherin 7 (CDH7) is a type II classical cadherin involved in calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion. The primary structure of CDH7 includes a sequence of cadherin repeats, which are extracellular domains crucial for homophilic binding interactions (Liu2007Cloning; Takahashi2008Expression). These extracellular cadherin (EC) domains are highly conserved and typically consist of about 100 amino acids each, contributing to the protein's adhesive properties (Sotomayor2014Sorting).

The secondary structure of CDH7 is characterized by beta-sheets that form the cadherin domains, which are essential for maintaining the structural integrity necessary for adhesion (Sotomayor2014Sorting). The tertiary structure involves the linear arrangement of these domains, facilitating their interaction with calcium ions, which are critical for the protein's adhesive function (Angst2001The).

In terms of quaternary structure, CDH7 forms dimers, a configuration that is vital for its role in cell adhesion (Angst2001The). Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, may occur, influencing the protein's stability and function (Sotomayor2014Sorting). Splice variants of CDH7 can result in isoforms with distinct functional properties, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context (Sotomayor2014Sorting).
