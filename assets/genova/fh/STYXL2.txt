# STYXL2

## Overview
The STYXL2 gene encodes a protein known as serine/threonine/tyrosine interacting-like 2, which is classified as a pseudophosphatase due to its predicted lack of catalytic activity. This protein is a member of the dual-specificity phosphatase family and plays a pivotal role in the regulation of sarcomere assembly, a process essential for muscle cell differentiation and function. Despite its classification, STYXL2 is catalytically inactive because of a substitution in its catalytic domain, which distinguishes it from other active phosphatases (Chen2023Styxl2). The protein is specifically expressed in striated muscles, including the heart and skeletal muscles, and is primarily localized in the cytoplasm. It is involved in the degradation of non-muscle myosin IIs through the autophagy-lysosome pathway, facilitating the transition to muscle-specific myosin and ensuring proper sarcomere maturation (Chen2023Styxl2). The expression of STYXL2 is regulated by the Jak1-Stat1 pathway, and its role is particularly crucial during muscle regeneration and development, although it is not required for the maintenance of existing sarcomeres in adult muscles (Chen2023Styxl2).

## Function
The STYXL2 gene encodes a pseudophosphatase involved in the regulation of sarcomere assembly, a critical process in muscle cell differentiation and function. Although it is part of the dual-specificity phosphatase family, STYXL2 is predicted to be catalytically inactive due to a substitution in its catalytic domain (Chen2023Styxl2). STYXL2 plays a crucial role in de novo sarcomere assembly by binding to non-muscle myosin IIs (NM IIs) and promoting their degradation through the autophagy-lysosome pathway. This degradation is essential for the replacement of NM IIs with muscle-specific myosin, facilitating proper sarcomere maturation and muscle function (Chen2023Styxl2).

STYXL2 is specifically expressed in striated muscles, including the heart and skeletal muscles, and is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm (Chen2023Styxl2). Its expression is regulated by the Jak1-Stat1 pathway, with levels decreasing upon activation by cytokines (Chen2023Styxl2). While STYXL2 is not required for the maintenance of existing sarcomeres in adult muscles, it is essential for sarcomere assembly during muscle regeneration and development (Chen2023Styxl2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the STYXL2 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions, particularly those affecting muscle development and function. STYXL2 is crucial for sarcomere assembly in striated muscles, and its disruption can lead to severe defects in muscle structure. In zebrafish, knockdown of STYXL2 results in significant disorganization of sarcomeres, leading to motility defects and near paralysis, highlighting its role in muscle development (Cooper2020A; Chen2023Styxl2). In mice, conditional deletion of STYXL2 causes neonatal lethality due to severe disruption of sarcomeric structures in cardiac and skeletal muscles, suggesting potential cardiac issues (Chen2023Styxl2).

STYXL2 has also been linked to congenital heart defects (CHD) in humans. Mutations in the coding region of STYXL2 and abnormal CpG methylation at its locus have been detected in some patients with CHD, indicating a potential association between STYXL2 and these heart conditions (Chen2023Styxl2). The gene's involvement in sarcomere assembly and its expression in cardiac muscles underscore its clinical significance in muscle-related disorders. Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of STYXL2 mutations and expression alterations in human diseases.

## Interactions
The STYXL2 protein is involved in the regulation of sarcomere assembly through its interaction with non-muscle myosin IIs (NM IIs), specifically Myh9 and Myh10. This interaction was identified using a BioID proximity-dependent protein labeling method and confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays in differentiated C2C12 myotubes (Chen2023Styxl2). STYXL2 binds directly to the head domains of Myh9 and Myh10, promoting their degradation via the autophagy-lysosome pathway, rather than the ubiquitination/proteasome pathway (Chen2023Styxl2). This degradation is crucial for the transition from NM IIs to muscle-specific myosin during skeletal muscle maturation (Chen2023Styxl2).

STYXL2 enhances the ubiquitination of Myh9, suggesting a role in selective autophagy, which is essential for sarcomere maturation (Chen2023Styxl2). The interaction between STYXL2 and NM IIs is critical during embryonic myogenesis, as the deletion of STYXL2 results in severe disruption of sarcomere structures (Chen2023Styxl2). The C-terminal fragment of STYXL2, without the DSPc domain, is responsible for promoting the degradation of Myh9, highlighting the importance of this interaction in sarcomere assembly (Chen2023Styxl2).
