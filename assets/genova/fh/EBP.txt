# EBP

## Overview
The EBP gene encodes the enzyme EBP cholestenol delta-isomerase, a crucial component in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. This enzyme is classified as a transmembrane protein and is involved in the conversion of 8-dehydrocholesterol to lathosterol, a key step in the production of cholesterol. Mutations in the EBP gene can lead to significant clinical disorders, most notably Conradi-Hünermann-Happle syndrome (CDPX2), an X-linked dominant condition characterized by skeletal, skin, and ocular anomalies (Barboza‐Cerda2014A; Has2000The). The gene's location on the X chromosome results in distinct phenotypic expressions in males and females, with males often experiencing more severe manifestations due to the lack of a second X chromosome to potentially counteract the mutation (Arnold2012ConradiHünermannHapple). Additionally, EBP mutations have been implicated in other syndromes, such as MEND syndrome in males, highlighting the gene's critical role in human development and health (Arnold2012ConradiHünermannHapple).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EBP gene, which encodes the enzyme 3-b-hydroxysteroid-D8,D7-isomerase, are primarily associated with Conradi-Hünermann-Happle syndrome (CDPX2), an X-linked dominant disorder. This condition is characterized by skeletal abnormalities, skin anomalies, and congenital cataracts, predominantly affecting females due to male lethality (Barboza‐Cerda2014A; Has2000The). The syndrome exhibits a wide range of clinical manifestations due to random X-inactivation, leading to increased levels of 8-dehydrocholesterol and 8(9)-cholestenol (Arnold2012ConradiHünermannHapple).

In males, EBP mutations can result in a distinct phenotype known as MEND syndrome, characterized by neurological defects and other clinical features. This condition is proposed as a new designation for nonlethal, nonmosaic EBP disease in males (Arnold2012ConradiHünermannHapple). Some males with hypomorphic EBP mutations exhibit neurological symptoms such as developmental delay and seizures, suggesting a male-specific disorder independent of CDPX2 (Barboza‐Cerda2014A).

The EBP gene mutations can also lead to a novel X-linked multiple congenital anomaly syndrome, characterized by central nervous system, ocular, genitourinary, dermatologic, craniofacial, skeletal, and cardiovascular anomalies. This condition is associated with elevated levels of certain sterols, such as 8(9)-cholestenol and 8-dehydrocholesterol (Furtado2010A).
