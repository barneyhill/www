# GULP1

## Overview
GULP1, or GULP PTB domain containing engulfment adaptor 1, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional adaptor protein involved in various cellular processes, including phagocytosis and apoptotic cell clearance. The protein is characterized by its phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, which facilitates interactions with other proteins, playing a crucial role in signal transduction pathways. GULP1 is integral to stabilin-1 and Jedi-1-mediated phagocytosis, where it aids in the engulfment of apoptotic cells through clathrin-dependent mechanisms (Sullivan2014The; Park2010Adaptor). Additionally, GULP1 is involved in regulating Arf6 signaling pathways, which are important for cellular migration and membrane trafficking (Ma2007Regulation). Clinically, GULP1 has been implicated in diseases such as ovarian cancer and Alzheimer's disease, where its expression and interactions are altered, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Chau2019Attenuation; Maldonado2018Integrated).

## Structure
The GULP1 protein features a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, which is integral to its function as an adaptor in cellular signaling pathways. The PTB domain of GULP1 adopts a canonical Pleckstrin homology fold, characterized by a 7-stranded beta-sandwich capped by a C-terminal helix. This structure also includes a short alpha-helix at the N-terminus and a large alpha-helix inserted between the beta1 and beta2 strands, similar to other PTB domains such as those in Dab2, X11, and FE65 (Chau2019Attenuation).

GULP1 also contains a leucine zipper domain, which suggests a potential role in DNA-binding and transcription regulation (Wahler2014P1‐059:). The protein's structure is further defined by a proline-rich region, contributing to its interaction capabilities (Park2010Adaptor).

Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, play a significant role in GULP1's function. Phosphorylation of threonine 35 by atypical protein kinase C isoforms is noted to influence the protein's interaction with the amyloid precursor protein (APP), affecting amyloid-beta production (Chau2019Attenuation). The protein's structure and function may also be influenced by alternative splicing, although specific isoforms are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
GULP1, also known as GULP PTB domain containing engulfment adaptor 1, plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in phagocytosis and apoptotic cell clearance. It functions as an adaptor protein, interacting with other proteins to facilitate signal transduction pathways. GULP1 is involved in stabilin-1-mediated phagocytosis, where it binds to the NPxF motif in the cytoplasmic region of stabilin-1, a multifunctional glycoprotein involved in the clearance of apoptotic cells. This interaction is crucial for the phagocytosis process, as demonstrated by decreased phagocytic activity upon GULP1 knockdown (Park2010Adaptor).

GULP1 also plays a role in Jedi-1-mediated phagocytosis through a clathrin-dependent mechanism. It interacts with the NPXY motif of Jedi-1, facilitating the recruitment of clathrin, which is necessary for the engulfment of apoptotic cells. This interaction is essential for the internalization process, as shown by experiments where GULP1 knockdown significantly reduced phagocytosis (Sullivan2014The).

In addition to its role in phagocytosis, GULP1 is involved in regulating Arf6 signaling pathways, which are important for cellular processes such as migration and membrane trafficking (Ma2007Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
GULP1 has been implicated in several diseases, particularly ovarian cancer and Alzheimer's disease, due to alterations in its expression and interactions. In ovarian cancer, GULP1 is frequently hypermethylated, leading to its reduced expression. This methylation is associated with advanced disease stages, high-grade tumors, and worse survival outcomes, suggesting that GULP1 acts as a tumor suppressor gene. Its silencing through methylation contributes to ovarian carcinogenesis by promoting pro-survival and anti-apoptotic pathways (Maldonado2018Integrated). GULP1 expression positively regulates TGF-β signaling, which is crucial for inhibiting cell growth in ovarian cancer cells. Low GULP1 expression results in impaired TGF-β signaling, contributing to cancer progression (Ma2012Engulfment).

In Alzheimer's disease, GULP1 interacts with the amyloid precursor protein (APP), influencing amyloid-beta (Ab) production. Phosphorylation of GULP1 by atypical protein kinase C isoforms reduces its interaction with APP, decreasing Ab generation. This regulatory mechanism offers a potential therapeutic target for reducing Ab levels in Alzheimer's disease (Chau2019Attenuation).

Additionally, a gene fusion involving EPC2 and GULP1 has been identified in medulloblastoma, a pediatric brain tumor. This fusion may create neoantigens, making it a target for immunotherapy (Paret2021Identification).

## Interactions
GULP1, also known as GULP PTB domain containing engulfment adaptor 1, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. GULP1 interacts with the amyloid precursor protein (APP), and this interaction is modulated by phosphorylation at threonine 35 (T35). Phosphorylation by atypical protein kinase C (PKCz) at T35 reduces the interaction between GULP1 and APP, affecting APP processing and amyloid-beta generation (Chau2019Attenuation).

GULP1 also interacts with the Arf6-specific GAP ACAP1. The PTB domain of GULP1 is necessary and sufficient for binding to ACAP1, specifically to its GAP domain and Ankyrin repeats. This interaction influences Arf6-GTP levels and is involved in regulating cell migration (Ma2007Regulation).

In the context of phagocytosis, GULP1 interacts with stabilin-1 through its PTB domain, binding to the NPxF motif in stabilin-1's cytoplasmic tail. This interaction is essential for stabilin-1-mediated phagocytosis and the clearance of apoptotic cells (Park2010Adaptor).

GULP1 also plays a role in Jedi-1-mediated phagocytosis by interacting with clathrin heavy chain (CHC). This interaction is necessary for the internalization process during phagocytosis, highlighting GULP1's involvement in clathrin-dependent mechanisms (Sullivan2014The).
