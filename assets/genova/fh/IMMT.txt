# IMMT

## Overview
The IMMT gene encodes the inner membrane mitochondrial protein Mic60, also known as Mitofilin, which is a crucial component of the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) complex. This protein plays a vital role in maintaining mitochondrial structure and function by organizing the inner mitochondrial membrane and facilitating the formation of cristae junctions. As a transmembrane protein, Mic60 is integral to mitochondrial dynamics, including processes such as fusion and fission, and is essential for the structural organization of mitochondrial cristae. It interacts with other MICOS components to ensure the stability and integrity of the complex, thereby influencing mitochondrial morphology and the organization of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) nucleoids. Disruptions in Mic60 function can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, which is implicated in various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancers (Eramo2019The; Li2015Mic60Mitofilin).

## Function
The IMMT gene encodes the protein Mic60, also known as Mitofilin, which is a critical component of the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) complex. This complex is essential for the organization of the mitochondrial inner membrane and the formation of cristae junctions, which are crucial for mitochondrial morphology and function (Li2015Mic60Mitofilin). Mic60/Mitofilin plays a pivotal role in the assembly of the MICOS complex, maintaining mitochondrial morphology, and organizing mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) nucleoids (Li2015Mic60Mitofilin). 

Mic60/Mitofilin is involved in mitochondrial dynamics, including fusion and fission processes, and is essential for the structural organization of mitochondrial cristae (Li2015Mic60Mitofilin). It interacts with other MICOS components, such as Mic19/CHCHD3, to ensure the stability and integrity of the complex (Li2015Mic60Mitofilin). The protein is also crucial for maintaining the morphology of mtDNA nucleoids and is more critical than Drp1 in this role (Li2015Mic60Mitofilin). 

Disruption in Mic60/Mitofilin homeostasis can lead to disorganized mitochondrial cristae and impaired mtDNA transcription, affecting mitochondrial function and energy production (Li2015Mic60Mitofilin).

## Clinical Significance
The IMMT gene, encoding the inner membrane mitochondrial protein, plays a significant role in various diseases due to its involvement in mitochondrial structure and function. In Parkinson's disease, rare coding variants in the IMMT gene have been identified in both familial and sporadic cases, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction through impaired PINK1-dependent phosphorylation sites on Mic60, a protein encoded by IMMT (Eramo2019The). In cancer, altered expression levels of IMMT are linked to several types, including breast, liver, prostate, colon, pancreatic, and gastric cancers. High IMMT expression is associated with poor survival rates and advanced disease status in breast cancer, where it serves as a potential diagnostic marker (Lin2023Multiomics). In hepatocellular carcinoma, IMMT is significantly upregulated, correlating with shorter overall survival and promoting cancer progression through the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway (Wang2023IMMT). IMMT is also implicated in neurological disorders, with reduced expression observed in Down syndrome and Parkinson's disease, where it can protect against cell death when overexpressed (Feng2018Mitochondrial). These findings highlight the clinical significance of IMMT in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
The human gene IMMT encodes the protein Mic60, also known as Mitofilin, which is a core component of the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) complex. Mic60 interacts with several proteins to maintain mitochondrial structure and function. It directly interacts with Mic19 (CHCHD3) and Mic25 (CHCHD6), forming a subcomplex essential for mitochondrial cristae architecture. The interaction between Mic60 and Mic19 is crucial for the stability of the MICOS complex, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays (Eramo2019The; Li2015Mic60Mitofilin).

Mic60 also interacts with the mitochondrial i-AAA protease Yme1L, which regulates its homeostasis and degradation. The binding region for Yme1L overlaps with that of Mic19, suggesting that Mic19 may stabilize Mic60 by preventing its degradation (Li2015Mic60Mitofilin). Additionally, Mic60 interacts with Sam50, a component of the mitochondrial intermembrane space bridging complex (MIB), which is crucial for maintaining cristae architecture (Ott2015Detailed).

In the context of disease, Mic60 is involved in the PINK1-Parkin pathway, where PINK1 phosphorylates Mic60, stabilizing its oligomerization and facilitating cristae remodeling. This interaction is important for mitophagy, a process that selectively degrades damaged mitochondria (Eramo2019The; Mukherjee2021MICOS).
