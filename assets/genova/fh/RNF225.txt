# RNF225

## Overview
RNF225 is a gene that encodes the ring finger protein 225, which is a member of the RING (Really Interesting New Gene) finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of a RING-type zinc finger domain, which is involved in mediating protein-protein interactions and often functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. E3 ubiquitin ligases play a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which regulates protein degradation and turnover within the cell. The specific biological functions and pathways involving RNF225 and its encoded protein are still under investigation, but it is believed to be involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and cell cycle regulation (Qiu2020aarFDC). Further research is needed to fully elucidate the role of RNF225 in health and disease.
