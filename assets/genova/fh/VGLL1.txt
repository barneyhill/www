# VGLL1

## Overview
VGLL1 (vestigial like family member 1) is a gene that encodes a transcriptional co-activator protein involved in the regulation of gene expression through its interaction with TEAD transcription factors. The VGLL1 protein is characterized by its TONDU domain, a conserved β-strand:α-helix motif that facilitates binding to TEAD proteins, playing a crucial role in the Hippo signaling pathway, which is important for controlling cell proliferation and apoptosis (Mesrouze2020A). Unlike other VGLL family members, VGLL1 lacks an Ω-loop in its TEAD-binding domain, yet it maintains sufficient binding affinity to compete with YAP and TAZ for TEAD interaction (Mesrouze2020A). VGLL1 is primarily expressed in epithelial tissues, such as the placenta, kidney, and lung, and is notably involved in processes related to cell proliferation and cancer progression (Bradley2020Vestigiallike; Mori2020The). Its dysregulation has been implicated in various cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Bradley2020Vestigiallike).

## Structure
The VGLL1 protein is a transcriptional co-activator that interacts with TEAD transcription factors through a conserved amino acid motif known as the TONDU domain. This domain is characterized by a β-strand:α-helix motif, which is crucial for its interaction with TEAD proteins (Mesrouze2020A). Unlike some other members of the VGLL family, VGLL1 does not possess an Ω-loop in its TEAD-binding domain, which is a structural element found in YAP and TAZ proteins that enhances binding to TEAD (Mesrouze2020A). Despite the absence of the Ω-loop, VGLL1 maintains sufficient binding affinity through the TONDU domain, allowing it to compete with YAP/TAZ for TEAD binding (Mesrouze2020A).

The VGLL1 protein in chickens, which shares structural similarities with the human version, is composed of three exons and has a molecular weight ranging from 26.64 to 32.66 kDa. Its secondary structure includes a significant content of extended chain structures (10.12%) and is primarily located in the nucleus (Hou2021Genomewide). The VGLL1 protein is hydrophilic, with an instability index suggesting it is an unstable protein (Hou2021Genomewide).

## Function
VGLL1 (vestigial like family member 1) is a transcriptional cofactor that plays a significant role in regulating gene expression through its interaction with TEAD transcription factors. In healthy human cells, VGLL1 is primarily expressed in epithelial lineage tissues, such as the placenta, kidney, and lung, and is notably present in placental trophoblasts (Mori2020The). It functions as a transcriptional co-activator, binding to the TEA domain (TEAD) family of transcription factors, which are implicated in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation and differentiation (Bradley2020Vestigiallike).

VGLL1 is involved in the Hippo signaling pathway, which is crucial for controlling organ size and tissue regeneration by regulating cell division and apoptosis (Mesrouze2020A). The interaction between VGLL1 and TEAD transcription factors is mediated through a conserved β-strand:α-helix motif known as the TONDU domain, which is essential for their binding (Mesrouze2020A). VGLL1's activity in the nucleus influences the transcription of genes that promote cell proliferation, such as IGFBP5, facilitating anchorage-independent cell proliferation, a characteristic important for both normal development and cancer progression (Bradley2020Vestigiallike).

## Clinical Significance
VGLL1 (vestigial like family member 1) is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression and interactions. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and basal-like breast cancers, VGLL1 is identified as a tumor-associated antigen, with its expression linked to shorter patient survival, suggesting a role in tumor aggressiveness (Bradley2020Vestigiallike). VGLL1 overexpression in gastric cancer is associated with increased metastasis and poor prognosis, regulated by the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This overexpression enhances cancer cell migration and invasiveness, contributing to larger metastatic nodules in vivo (Kim2019PI3KAKTβCatenin).

In ovarian cancer, VGLL1 is upregulated through N6-methyladenosine modification, promoting metastasis via the HMGA1/Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Its expression correlates with poor survival outcomes, and knockdown of VGLL1 suppresses cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (Xia2022N6methyladenosinemodified). VGLL1 is also overexpressed in triple-negative and basal-like breast cancers, where it is associated with reduced overall survival and aggressive tumor phenotypes (Castilla2014VGLL1).

These findings suggest VGLL1 as a potential therapeutic target across multiple cancer types, although safety concerns exist due to possible reactivity against non-essential tissues (Bradley2020Vestigiallike).

## Interactions
VGLL1 interacts primarily with TEAD transcription factors, forming complexes that are crucial for its role as a transcriptional cofactor. The interaction between VGLL1 and TEAD is mediated by a conserved β-strand:α-helix motif known as the TONDU domain. This motif allows VGLL1 to bind to TEAD, similar to the YAP protein, although VGLL1 lacks the Ω-loop required by YAP for binding (Mesrouze2020A). VGLL1 competes with YAP and TAZ for binding to TEAD, highlighting its role in modulating transcriptional activity within the Hippo pathway (Gemma2020VGLL1; Yamaguchi2020Multiple).

In ovarian cancer, VGLL1 interacts with TEAD4 to activate the HMGA1/Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, promoting metastasis. This interaction is stabilized by m6A modification of VGLL1 mRNA, which is recognized by the m6A 'reader' protein IGF2BP2 (Xia2022N6methyladenosinemodified). VGLL1 also plays a role in the expression of human papillomavirus (HPV) early genes by forming a complex with TEAD1, which is essential for binding to the HPV long control region and activating early promoters (Mori2020The). These interactions underscore VGLL1's involvement in various cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer.
