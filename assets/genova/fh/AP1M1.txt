# AP1M1

## Overview
The AP1M1 gene encodes the adaptor-related protein complex 1 subunit mu 1, a critical component of the adaptor protein complex 1 (AP-1). This protein is integral to the clathrin-mediated vesicle formation process, playing a pivotal role in the intracellular trafficking and sorting of proteins between the trans-Golgi network and endosomes. As a part of the AP-1 complex, the μ1A subunit is essential for the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles, which are crucial for maintaining cellular polarity and ensuring the correct localization of proteins, such as mannose 6-phosphate receptors and lysosomal enzymes (Meyer2000μ1Aadaptindeficient; Caceres2019Quantitative). Additionally, AP1M1 is involved in significant protein interactions and signaling pathways, including those exploited by the hepatitis B virus to promote liver cancer cell proliferation (Kou2019HBV). The gene's dysregulation is associated with various diseases, highlighting its importance in both normal cellular function and pathological conditions.

## Function
The AP1M1 gene encodes the μ1A subunit of the adaptor protein complex 1 (AP-1), which is integral to clathrin-mediated vesicle formation. This complex is crucial for sorting and trafficking proteins between the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and endosomes. The AP-1 complex, including the μ1A subunit, facilitates the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles, which are essential for the proper sorting and transport of proteins to various intracellular and extracellular destinations (Meyer2000μ1Aadaptindeficient). 

In healthy cells, AP1M1 is involved in the trafficking of mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) and lysosomal enzymes. It ensures the correct localization and function of MPRs, which are responsible for transporting lysosomal enzymes from the TGN to endosomes and lysosomes. The absence of μ1A-adaptin leads to the misrouting of MPRs, affecting the sorting of lysosomal enzymes and resulting in their increased secretion (Meyer2000μ1Aadaptindeficient). 

AP1M1 also plays a role in maintaining cellular polarity, particularly in epithelial cells. It is involved in the polarized distribution of surface proteins, influencing both apical and basolateral pathways. This function is critical for the proper organization and distribution of proteins on the cell surface, contributing to cellular polarity (Caceres2019Quantitative).

## Clinical Significance
The AP1M1 gene, a component of the AP-1 complex, plays a significant role in cellular processes, and its dysregulation is linked to various diseases. In the context of liver cancer, particularly with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, AP1M1 expression is upregulated, leading to increased proliferation of liver cancer cells. This upregulation is facilitated by the HBV protein HBX, which activates the PI3K-AKT and JNK pathways, enhancing AP1M1 expression and promoting cell proliferation (Kou2019HBV). Silencing AP1M1 expression in HBV-transfected liver cancer cells significantly reduces their proliferation, indicating its crucial role in cancer progression (Kou2019HBV).

AP1M1 is also implicated in bone signaling, as it is involved in cellular processes related to bone growth and division. However, specific clinical conditions directly linked to AP1M1 mutations in bone diseases are not detailed (Khusboo2022Identification). While the context does not provide direct evidence of AP1M1 mutations causing specific diseases, its role in cellular trafficking and proliferation suggests that alterations in its expression or function could contribute to various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
AP1M1, a subunit of the adaptor protein complex 1 (AP-1), is involved in several critical protein interactions. It interacts with γ-adaptin, a large subunit of the AP-1 complex, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments in Arabidopsis, where AP1M1 was shown to bind with γ-adaptin but not with α-adaptin, which is part of the AP-2 complex (Park2013Arabidopsis). This interaction is crucial for the formation and function of the AP-1 complex, which is involved in vesicle trafficking and protein sorting.

In the context of viral interactions, AP1M1 is exploited by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) through the HBX protein, which upregulates AP1M1 expression in liver cancer cells. This upregulation is linked to the activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway, a key signaling pathway for cell proliferation (Kou2019HBV). AP1M1 binds to YXXΦ motifs of proteins such as the insulin receptor substrate (IRS-1), facilitating the activation of this pathway.

These interactions highlight the role of AP1M1 in both cellular trafficking processes and in the modulation of signaling pathways, which can be co-opted by viral proteins to enhance viral replication and cell proliferation.
