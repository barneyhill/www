# FIBCD1

## Overview
FIBCD1 is a gene that encodes the protein fibrinogen C domain containing 1, which is a member of the fibrinogen-related domain (FReD) superfamily. This protein functions primarily as a pattern recognition receptor (PRR) and is expressed as a tetramer on the apical surface of epithelial cells. It plays a significant role in both the immune system and neuronal development. In the immune system, FIBCD1 is involved in recognizing and binding acetylated structures such as chitin, thereby modulating immune responses and maintaining homeostasis in epithelial tissues like the intestines and lungs (Jepsen2018FIBCD1). In the brain, FIBCD1 interacts with chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, influencing neuronal maturation and function, particularly in regions such as the hippocampus (Fell2021FIBCD1). The protein's structure includes a fibrinogen-related domain crucial for its binding capabilities, and it can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing (Graca2022The). FIBCD1 has also been implicated in various clinical conditions, including neurodevelopmental disorders and certain cancers, where its expression levels may serve as a prognostic marker (Wang2019FIBCD1; Fell2021FIBCD1).

## Structure
FIBCD1 is a protein that belongs to the fibrinogen-related domain (FReD) superfamily and is expressed as a tetramer on the apical surface of epithelial cells (Jepsen2018FIBCD1). The primary structure of FIBCD1 includes a cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane region, and an extracellular domain. The extracellular domain consists of a coiled-coil region, a polycationic region, and a fibrinogen-related domain (FReD) (Wang2019FIBCD1). The FReD domain is crucial for the protein's function, as it facilitates calcium-dependent binding of acetylated structures, such as chitin, through a conserved S1 binding site (Jepsen2018FIBCD1).

The quaternary structure of FIBCD1 involves its assembly into tetramers, which are linked by disulfide bonds and are approximately 250 kDa in size (Wang2019FIBCD1). This tetrameric assembly is essential for its function as a pattern recognition receptor (PRR) involved in immune system regulation (Wang2019FIBCD1). FIBCD1 can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, including a full-length transmembrane version and a shorter secreted version, both containing a fibrinogen-like domain (Graca2022The). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can influence its function and interactions.

## Function
The FIBCD1 gene encodes a protein that functions as a receptor for chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) in the brain extracellular matrix, playing a critical role in neuronal maturation and function. It preferentially binds to CS-4S glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and mediates a transcriptional program necessary for cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, influencing genes related to ECM binding and structure (Fell2021FIBCD1). FIBCD1 is highly expressed in the hippocampus and is involved in the recognition of ECM sulphation, essential for neuronal development and function. In healthy cells, it regulates extracellular matrix composition through endocytosis or receptor-mediated signaling (Fell2021FIBCD1).

In the immune system, FIBCD1 acts as a pattern recognition receptor (PRR) that binds acetylated structures such as chitin, modulating the immune response by influencing the activity of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and suppressing inflammatory mediators like IL-8 and mucins (Jepsen2018FIBCD1). It is expressed in various epithelial tissues, including the intestinal and lung epithelium, where it plays a role in maintaining immune homeostasis by regulating responses to fungal components and other environmental antigens (Jepsen2018FIBCD1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FIBCD1 gene have been implicated in various neurodevelopmental disorders. In humans, FIBCD1 is highly expressed in the brain, particularly in regions such as the hippocampus, hypothalamus, and cortex. Although no genetic disorders have been definitively linked to FIBCD1 variants, studies have identified patients with undiagnosed neurodevelopmental disorders who possess high CADD scoring variants in FIBCD1. These patients exhibit symptoms such as severe autism spectrum disorder, delayed verbal cognition, and structural brain abnormalities, suggesting a potential role of FIBCD1 variants in these conditions (Fell2021FIBCD1).

FIBCD1 is also associated with various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), lung adenocarcinoma, mesothelioma, and uveal melanoma. High expression of FIBCD1 correlates with poor prognosis and reduced overall survival in these cancers. In HCC, elevated FIBCD1 expression is linked to larger tumor size, advanced stage, and vascular invasion, making it a potential biomarker for prognosis evaluation (Wang2019FIBCD1).

Additionally, FIBCD1 plays a role in immune responses, particularly in lung epithelial cells, where it modulates inflammatory responses and maintains mucosal barrier integrity (Jepsen2018FIBCD1).

## Interactions
FIBCD1 interacts with integrin receptors, particularly integrin ItgÎ±2b, which is necessary for FIBCD1-induced ERK phosphorylation in muscle cells. This interaction is crucial for mitigating cancer-induced myofiber atrophy, as demonstrated by the ability of recombinant FIBCD1 (rFibcd1) to rescue myofiber atrophy in a mouse model of cancer cachexia (Graca2022The).

In the immune system, FIBCD1 acts as a pattern recognition receptor (PRR) and binds to acetylated compounds such as chitin. It is involved in the immune response against Aspergillus fumigatus by binding to its cell wall components, including chitin-rich regions. This binding is not exclusively through the S1 binding site, indicating additional binding sites outside the S1 binding pocket (Jepsen2018FIBCD1).

FIBCD1 also interacts with chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) in the brain extracellular matrix, specifically binding to CS-4S glycosaminoglycans. This interaction is important for neuronal maturation and function, and certain variants of FIBCD1 can disrupt this binding, potentially contributing to neurodevelopmental disorders (Fell2021FIBCD1).
