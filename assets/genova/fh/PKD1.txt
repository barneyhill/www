# PKD1

## Overview
The PKD1 gene encodes polycystin-1, a large transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a critical role in cellular signaling and mechanosensation, particularly within the kidney. Polycystin-1 is a multifunctional protein involved in the regulation of calcium ion channels and is essential for maintaining normal kidney function and structure. It interacts with polycystin-2 to form a complex that functions as a calcium-permeable ion channel, crucial for mechanotransduction in kidney epithelial cells (Nauli2003Polycystins). Mutations in PKD1 are a major cause of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), a genetic disorder characterized by the development of numerous cysts in the kidneys, leading to progressive renal failure (Tan2011Autosomal). The protein's structure, featuring multiple domains for protein-protein and protein-carbohydrate interactions, underscores its role in cell signaling and maintaining epithelial architecture (Bycroft1999The; Unknownauthors1995Polycystic).

## Structure
The PKD1 gene encodes polycystin-1, a large transmembrane glycoprotein involved in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Polycystin-1 is composed of 4304 amino acids and has a predicted molecular weight of 462 kDa (Unknownauthors1995Polycystic). The protein features a long N-terminal extracellular region, which includes leucine-rich repeats, cysteine-rich domains, a C-type lectin carbohydrate recognition domain, and an LDL-A domain (Unknownauthors1995Polycystic). It also contains 16 copies of an 80-90 amino acid repeat known as the PKD domain, which has a β-sandwich fold similar to the immunoglobulin-like fold (Bycroft1999The).

The transmembrane region of polycystin-1 consists of 11 segments, with the N-terminal region located extracellularly and the C-terminal region being short and cytoplasmic (Nims2003Transmembrane; Sandford1997Comparative). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which is crucial for its function and integration into the membrane (Nims2003Transmembrane). The PKD domains are involved in protein-protein and protein-carbohydrate interactions, contributing to the protein's role in cell signaling and mechanosensation (Bycroft1999The). The structure of polycystin-1 suggests it plays a role in epithelial differentiation and maintaining tubular architecture (Unknownauthors1995Polycystic).

## Function
The PKD1 gene encodes polycystin-1, a large multifunctional protein involved in several critical cellular processes. In healthy human cells, polycystin-1 is primarily associated with the primary cilium of kidney epithelial cells, where it plays a crucial role in mechanosensation. It functions as a mechano-fluid stress sensor, detecting the bending of the primary cilium caused by fluid flow. This mechanical signal is transduced into a chemical response by activating polycystin-2, a calcium-permeable cation channel, leading to a local calcium influx in the cilium (Nauli2003Polycystins).

Polycystin-1 is also involved in protein-protein and protein-carbohydrate interactions in the extracellular space, potentially binding to components of the extracellular matrix or cell membrane-associated proteins. This suggests a role in mediating cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions, which are essential for maintaining normal epithelial differentiation and tubular architecture (Unknownauthors1995Polycystic).

In addition to its role in mechanosensation, polycystin-1 is implicated in cell cycle regulation and signaling pathways, such as the JAK-STAT and JNK/AP1 pathways, indicating its involvement in broader cellular functions beyond the cilium (Boucher2004Autosomal). These functions are vital for normal kidney development and function, and disruptions can lead to conditions such as autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) (Ward1996Polycystin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PKD1 gene are primarily associated with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), a common genetic disorder characterized by the formation of numerous cysts in the kidneys, leading to progressive renal failure. PKD1 mutations account for approximately 85-90% of ADPKD cases, with these mutations often resulting in a more severe disease phenotype compared to PKD2 mutations (Tan2011Autosomal; Unknownauthors1995Polycystic). The median age of onset for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in individuals with PKD1 mutations is significantly earlier than those with PKD2 mutations, typically around 54-55 years (Tan2011Autosomal; Kimura2023PKD1).

PKD1 mutations can also lead to various extrarenal manifestations, including hepatic, pancreatic, and splenic cysts, as well as cardiovascular abnormalities such as cardiac valve defects and an increased risk of intracranial aneurysms (Unknownauthors1995Polycystic). The position of the mutation within the PKD1 gene can influence disease severity, with mutations in the 5' region associated with earlier onset of ESRD and a higher prevalence of intracranial aneurysms (Rossetti2002The). Large DNA rearrangements in PKD1, including deletions, can lead to contiguous gene deletion syndromes, further complicating the clinical presentation (Tan2011Autosomal).

## Interactions
PKD1 encodes polycystin-1 (PC1), a protein that interacts with polycystin-2 (PC2) to form a complex functioning as a calcium-permeable ion channel. This interaction is crucial for normal cellular signaling and stability, as mutations disrupting PKD1-PC2 interactions can lead to enhanced PKD1 degradation and affect tubulogenesis (Tsiokas1997Homo). PKD1 and PC2 interact through their C-terminal cytoplasmic tails, forming heterodimers, while PC2 can also form homodimers through a distinct coiled-coil domain (Tsiokas1997Homo).

PKD1 is involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, interacting with extracellular matrix proteins such as collagens and fibronectin through its C-type lectin and leucine-rich repeat domains. These interactions are significant in the context of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) (Hardy2020Polycystins). PKD1 also forms complexes with focal adhesion proteins, including focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and actin-binding proteins, which are crucial for cell-matrix signaling (Hardy2020Polycystins).

PKD1 interacts with G proteins, influencing calcium and potassium channel activities, and is involved in signaling pathways that regulate cell migration and kidney tubule formation. These interactions are critical for understanding PKD1's role in disease mechanisms (Hardy2020Polycystins).
