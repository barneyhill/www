# KLC2

## Overview
KLC2 is a gene that encodes the protein kinesin light chain 2, a critical component of the kinesin-1 motor protein complex. This protein is categorized as a motor protein and plays a pivotal role in intracellular transport by facilitating the movement of various cellular components along microtubules. Kinesin light chain 2 is characterized by its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, which is essential for binding specific cargo proteins and regulating the activity of the kinesin-1 complex. The gene's expression and function are regulated through mechanisms such as phosphorylation and alternative splicing, which influence its interactions and transport capabilities. KLC2 is implicated in several physiological and pathological processes, including neurological disorders, cancer progression, and viral infections, highlighting its significance in cellular function and disease (Ichimura2002PhosphorylationDependent; Wang2015High; Yip2016The).

## Structure
Kinesin light chain 2 (KLC2) is a component of the kinesin-1 motor protein complex, which plays a crucial role in intracellular transport. The primary structure of KLC2 includes a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, which is essential for protein-protein interactions. This domain consists of a series of helix-turn-helix motifs, forming a right-handed super-helical conformation (Pernigo2013Structural). KLC2's TPR domain is involved in recognizing and binding to specific cargo proteins, often through interactions with W-acidic motifs (Yip2016The).

The secondary structure of KLC2 is characterized by alpha-helices, with the TPR domain comprising six TPR repeats (Zhu2012Crystal). The tertiary structure involves the overall 3D folding of these helices, creating a concave groove that facilitates cargo binding (Yip2016The). The quaternary structure of KLC2 includes its interaction with kinesin heavy chains, forming part of the kinesin-1 complex (Ichimura2002PhosphorylationDependent).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating KLC2's function. Phosphorylation at specific sites, like Ser575, is necessary for interactions with proteins such as 14-3-3 (Ichimura2002PhosphorylationDependent). KLC2 also exhibits splice variant isoforms, which may have different functional properties (Carpentier2015Vaccinia).

## Function
Kinesin light chain 2 (KLC2) is a crucial component of the kinesin-1 motor protein complex, which plays a significant role in intracellular transport processes. KLC2 is responsible for binding cargoes and regulating the activity of kinesin-1 through its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain. This domain recognizes specific peptide motifs, such as W-acidic motifs, which are essential for cargo binding and transport along microtubules (Yip2016The).

KLC2 is involved in maintaining the autoinhibited state of kinesin-1 in the absence of cargo. Upon cargo binding, KLC2 undergoes a conformational change that activates the motor protein, facilitating the transport of various cellular components, including proteins, ribonuclear proteins, vesicles, and organelles (Yip2016The). This regulation is vital for normal cellular functions and has implications in neurological disorders and pathogen infections (Yip2016The).

Phosphorylation of KLC2 also plays a regulatory role. The interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, which is dependent on the phosphorylation of KLC2 at Ser575, suggests a mechanism for modulating kinesin motor activity, crucial for intracellular transport and stress-induced signaling pathways (Ichimura2002PhosphorylationDependent).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the KLC2 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), high expression of KLC2 is associated with poor clinical outcomes, particularly in elderly patients. KLC2 enhances the invasive and migratory abilities of NSCLC cells, acting as a proto-oncogene. It is regulated by miR-125b, which targets the 3' UTR of KLC2, leading to decreased protein expression. An inverse correlation between miR-125b and KLC2 protein expression is observed in clinical NSCLC samples (Wang2015High).

KLC2 is also implicated in SPOAN syndrome, a severe neurodegenerative disorder characterized by spastic paraplegia, optic atrophy, and neuropathy. This condition is caused by a homozygous 216-bp deletion in the non-coding region of KLC2, leading to its overexpression. This deletion has been identified in affected individuals from Brazil and Egypt, suggesting a broader geographical distribution (Melo2015Overexpression; de2018Origin).

Additionally, KLC2 deficiency is linked to sensorineural hearing loss. In mice, the absence of KLC2 results in low-frequency hearing loss due to abnormal mitochondrial distribution in cochlear hair cells, leading to their degeneration. A similar phenotype is observed in humans with a KLC2 gene variant (Fu2021Deficiency).

## Interactions
Kinesin light chain 2 (KLC2) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in intracellular transport. One significant interaction is with the 14-3-3 protein, specifically the 14-3-3η isoform. This interaction is phosphorylation-dependent, requiring the phosphorylation of KLC2 at the Ser575 residue. The binding site for 14-3-3η is localized to the C-terminal tail of KLC2, and this interaction is essential for the regulation of kinesin motor activity (Ichimura2002PhosphorylationDependent).

KLC2 also interacts with the vaccinia virus protein complex F12/E2. This interaction is specific to the C-terminal tail of KLC2 and is necessary for the intracellular transport of enveloped virus particles. The F12/E2 complex engages the kinesin-1 motor complex through KLC2, facilitating the movement of viral particles to the cell surface. The interaction is specific to KLC2 and does not occur with KLC1, highlighting the unique role of KLC2 in viral transport (Carpentier2015Vaccinia).

These interactions underscore the role of KLC2 in cellular transport processes, both in normal cellular function and in the context of viral infection.
