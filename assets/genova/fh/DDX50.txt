# DDX50

## Overview
DDX50 is a gene that encodes the DExD-box helicase 50, a member of the DExD/H-box family of RNA helicases. This protein is primarily involved in the processing of ribosomal RNA and the assembly of ribosomes, which are essential for protein synthesis and cellular growth (Pallett2022DDX50). DExD-box helicase 50 exhibits ATPase and helicase activities, enabling it to unwind RNA duplexes, a critical function in RNA metabolism and regulation (Pallett2022DDX50). Beyond its role in ribosome biogenesis, DExD-box helicase 50 is implicated in the innate immune response, particularly in the activation of the IRF3 signaling pathway, which is crucial for antiviral defense (Pallett2022DDX50). The protein interacts with various partners, including TRIF and DDX1, to facilitate RNA sensing and enhance immune signaling pathways (Pallett2020DDX50). Through these interactions, DExD-box helicase 50 contributes to the host's ability to respond to viral infections, highlighting its significance in both cellular and immune functions.

## Function
DDX50, a member of the DExD-Box RNA helicase family, is primarily localized in the nucleoli of cells, where it plays a significant role in ribosomal RNA processing and ribosome assembly, contributing to protein synthesis and cellular growth (Pallett2022DDX50). It possesses ATPase and helicase activity, which are crucial for its function in unwinding RNA duplexes, specifically targeting 21-nt duplex RNA for unwinding (Pallett2022DDX50). Although DDX50 lacks RNA folding activity, it is essential for the optimal unwinding activity of DDX21, suggesting a co-dependent relationship between these two proteins (Pallett2022DDX50).

In addition to its role in ribosome biogenesis, DDX50 is involved in the activation of the IRF3 signaling pathway, which is critical for the innate immune response to viral infections (Pallett2022DDX50). It acts as a viral restriction factor by enhancing IRF3 activation, leading to the transcriptional upregulation of cytokines, chemokines, and type I interferons (Pallett2022DDX50). DDX50's function in immune signaling is independent of the DDX1 complex, indicating its unique role in RNA-dependent signaling pathways (Pallett2022DDX50).

## Interactions
DDX50, a DExD/H-box helicase, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its role in RNA sensing and antiviral defense. It interacts with TRIF, a key adaptor protein in the IRF3/NF-ÎºB signaling pathway, enhancing TRIF-dependent IRF3 activation. This interaction is essential for the phosphorylation of IRF3, a critical step in the signaling cascade (Pallett2020DDX50). DDX50 also co-immunoprecipitates with DDX1, forming a complex that facilitates TRIF recruitment and activation, which is vital for the optimal functioning of the RNA sensing complex (Pallett2020DDX50).

DDX50 shares significant amino acid identity with DDX21 and may act similarly in the DDX1-DHX36-DDX21 complex, where DDX21 serves as a scaffold to recruit TRIF. DDX50 is essential for DDX21 helicase activity, indicating a supportive role in the complex (Pallett2020DDX50). Additionally, DDX50 has been implicated in MAP-kinase signaling through its interaction with c-Jun, enhancing IRF3-dependent gene transcription and cytokine synthesis in response to viral infections (Pallett2020DDX50). These interactions underscore DDX50's role in the host's innate immune response and its function in antiviral signaling.
