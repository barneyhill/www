# ZC3H11A

## Overview
ZC3H11A is a gene that encodes the zinc finger CCCH-type containing 11A protein, which is a crucial component in RNA metabolism, particularly in mRNA processing and export. This protein is categorized as a zinc finger protein due to its characteristic CCCH-type zinc finger motifs, which facilitate its binding to RNA. ZC3H11A is integral to the Transcription-Export (TREX) complex, playing a pivotal role in the nuclear export of mRNA, thereby ensuring proper mRNA processing, including capping, splicing, and polyadenylation. The protein's interactions with other nuclear components, such as the poly(A)-binding protein PABPN1, are essential for its localization and function within nuclear speckles. ZC3H11A also plays a significant role in regulating NF-kB signaling pathways, impacting immune response and inflammation. Additionally, it is involved in the replication of certain viruses, such as adenovirus and HIV-1, by supporting mRNA accumulation in viral replication centers (Kases2023ZC3H11A; Younis2018Multiple; Darweesh2022ZC3H11A).

## Structure


## Function
The ZC3H11A gene encodes a zinc finger protein that is integral to mRNA processing and export in healthy human cells. It is a component of the Transcription-Export (TREX) complex, which is responsible for the nuclear export of mRNA, ensuring that mRNAs are properly processed, including capping, splicing, polyadenylation, and m6A modification (Kases2023ZC3H11A). ZC3H11A interacts with the nuclear poly(A)-binding protein PABPN1, which influences its localization to nuclear speckles, structures involved in mRNA processing (Kases2023ZC3H11A).

ZC3H11A plays a crucial role in regulating NF-kB signaling by facilitating the export and stability of IkBa mRNA, an inhibitor of NF-kB. In the absence of ZC3H11A, IkBa mRNA is retained in the nucleus, leading to reduced cytoplasmic levels of IkBa protein and enhanced NF-kB signaling, which affects immune response regulation (Darweesh2022ZC3H11A). The protein is also involved in the negative regulation of NF-kB signaling pathways, as its loss leads to increased expression of immune-related genes such as IL-6 (Darweesh2022ZC3H11A).

ZC3H11A is not essential for normal cell growth but is crucial under stress conditions, such as heat shock, where it supports cell viability and mRNA export (Younis2018Multiple).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the ZC3H11A gene have been implicated in several diseases, notably cancer and high myopia. In the context of cancer, ZC3H11A is involved in various cancer types, with its phosphorylation, genetic alterations, and expression levels playing significant roles. Phosphorylation of ZC3H11A varies across cancer types, with reduced levels observed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), and increased levels in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Genetic alterations, such as mutations and amplifications, are prevalent in breast and endometrial cancers, although they do not significantly affect overall survival or disease-free survival in a pan-cancer context, except in GBM where they are significant. High expression levels of ZC3H11A are generally associated with poor prognosis in cancers like cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CESC), kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), and low-grade glioma (LGG), but correlate with better survival in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) (Li2023Analysis).

In high myopia, ZC3H11A mutations lead to enhanced NF-κB signaling due to defective IκBα protein expression, resulting in upregulation of inflammation-related mRNAs. This suggests that ZC3H11A mutations may trigger inflammatory reactions via the PI3K-AKT and NF-κB pathways, contributing to the development of high myopia (Chen2023ZC3H11A).

## Interactions
ZC3H11A is a CCCH-type zinc finger protein that plays a significant role in RNA metabolism, including mRNA export. It is a component of the Transcription and EXport (TREX) complex, which is essential for nuclear mRNA export (Darweesh2022ZC3H11A; Li2023Analysis). ZC3H11A interacts with the nuclear poly(A)-binding protein PABPN1, which controls its localization into nuclear speckles. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of polyadenylation of nuclear mRNA, particularly during viral infections (Kases2023ZC3H11A).

The protein is also involved in the regulation of NF-kB signaling. ZC3H11A negatively regulates this pathway by affecting the stability and export of IkBa mRNA, which is crucial for maintaining normal NF-kB activity. The absence of ZC3H11A leads to enhanced NF-kB signaling due to defective IkBa protein expression (Darweesh2022ZC3H11A).

ZC3H11A is required for the efficient replication of multiple nuclear-replicating viruses, such as adenovirus and HIV-1. It binds preferentially to purine-rich sequences and redistributes to viral replication centers in infected cells. Mutations in its zinc fingers impair its ability to support mRNA accumulation for these viruses (Younis2018Multiple).
