# MYO1F

## Overview
The MYO1F gene encodes the protein myosin IF, an unconventional long-tailed class I myosin that plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, particularly within the immune system. Myosin IF is characterized by its motor domain, which facilitates actin binding and ATPase activity, and its tail domains, which mediate interactions with cellular membranes and other proteins. This protein is integral to the regulation of cell adhesion and motility, especially in immune cells such as neutrophils, macrophages, and mast cells. Through its interactions with integrins and the actin cytoskeleton, myosin IF influences processes like cell migration, phagocytosis, and cytokine production, thereby contributing to immune responses and inflammation (NavinésFerrer2019Myo1f; NavinésFerrer2020LongTailed; Kim2006Modulation).

## Structure
Myo1f is an unconventional long-tailed class I myosin, characterized by several distinct structural domains. The protein includes an N-terminal motor domain, which is responsible for its actin-binding and ATPase activity, essential for its function as a molecular motor (NavinésFerrer2019Myo1f; Kim2006Modulation). It also contains light-chain-binding IQ motifs, which are involved in binding calmodulin or other light chains, contributing to the regulation of its motor activity (Kim2006Modulation).

The tail region of Myo1f features a basic tail homology 1 (TH1) domain, which is thought to mediate interactions with membranes (Kim2006Modulation). Additionally, Myo1f possesses a proline-rich TH2 domain and a TH3 domain containing a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and may play roles in linking the actin cytoskeleton to other cellular components (NavinésFerrer2019Myo1f).

Myo1f is expressed in various immune cells and is involved in processes such as cell adhesion and migration, often through interactions with integrins and other proteins (NavinésFerrer2019Myo1f; Kim2006Modulation). The protein's structure allows it to participate in complex cellular functions, including the regulation of integrin-mediated adhesion and motility.

## Function
The MYO1F gene encodes a long-tailed class I myosin protein that plays a crucial role in immune cell function, particularly in neutrophils, macrophages, and mast cells. MYO1F is involved in modulating cell adhesion and motility, essential for effective immune responses. It interacts with β2-integrins, regulating neutrophil adhesion and motility in extracellular matrices. The absence of MYO1F leads to excessive adherence of neutrophils to integrin ligands and increased exocytosis of β2-integrin-containing granules, impairing neutrophil migration and host defense (MaravillasMontero2011The; Kim2006Modulation).

MYO1F is also crucial for the deformation and migration of the nucleus through narrow spaces during neutrophil migration in 3D environments, a process essential for acute inflammation responses (Salvermoser2018Myosin). In macrophages, MYO1F is involved in integrin-mediated spreading and phagocytosis, tethering the plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeleton, which facilitates engulfment and internalization of targets (NavinésFerrer2020LongTailed). In mast cells, MYO1F is necessary for the secretion and localization of activated integrin molecules, aiding in cell adhesion and migration (NavinésFerrer2020LongTailed). These functions highlight MYO1F's role in maintaining the balance between cell adhesion and motility, crucial for immune cell function and host defense.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the MYO1F gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. A notable mutation, c.400G>A, resulting in a p.Gly134Ser substitution, has been associated with increased tumor proliferation in thyroid cancer. This mutation enhances cell proliferation and invasiveness, potentially through increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 kinases, and is linked to mitochondrial network alterations and increased reactive oxygen species production, contributing to oncogenic potential (Diquigiovanni2018Mutant).

In the context of inflammatory diseases, MYO1F plays a significant role in macrophage function and cytokine production. Overexpression of MYO1F in macrophages can lead to a proinflammatory phenotype, exacerbating conditions like colitis by increasing the production of cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-6. This suggests that MYO1F may contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (PiedraQuintero2019Myosin).

MYO1F is also crucial for neutrophil migration, and its deficiency can impair immune responses. MYO1F-deficient neutrophils exhibit increased adhesion but reduced motility, leading to higher susceptibility to infections, as demonstrated in models of Listeria monocytogenes infection (NavinésFerrer2020LongTailed).

## Interactions
MYO1F, an unconventional long-tailed myosin, participates in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. It interacts with the adaptor protein 3BP2, which is involved in mast cell migration. This interaction is significant for the signaling cascade triggered by the stem cell factor (SCF) and KIT receptor, and it is independent of phosphorylation, likely involving the SH3 domain of MYO1F and the proline-rich domain of 3BP2 (NavinésFerrer2019Myo1f). MYO1F also interacts with integrins, particularly integrin-αVβ3, which is crucial for intercellular adhesion in macrophages. This interaction enhances the adhesive properties of macrophages, facilitating their polarization to a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype (PiedraQuintero2019Myosin).

In addition, MYO1F is involved in the regulation of integrin-mediated adhesion and motility in immune cells, such as neutrophils and mast cells. It affects the expression of integrins β1 and β7, which are essential for cell adhesion and migration (NavinésFerrer2019Myo1f; Kim2006Modulation). MYO1F's interaction with the actin cytoskeleton is also significant, as it co-localizes with cortical actin filaments, suggesting a role in modulating actin dynamics and granule exocytosis (Kim2006Modulation).
