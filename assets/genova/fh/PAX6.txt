# PAX6

## Overview
PAX6 is a highly conserved gene that encodes the paired box 6 protein, a transcription factor pivotal in the development of the eyes, brain, and pancreas. The PAX6 protein is characterized by its paired domain and homeodomain, which facilitate its role in DNA binding and gene regulation. As a transcription factor, PAX6 is integral to ocular morphogenesis, influencing the development of the lens, cornea, and retina, and is also involved in maintaining neural stem cells and promoting neuronal differentiation. In the pancreas, PAX6 regulates genes critical for insulin secretion and glucose metabolism. Mutations in the PAX6 gene are linked to various ocular disorders, such as aniridia and microphthalmia, as well as systemic conditions including neurodevelopmental disorders and diabetes. The gene's interactions with other proteins and DNA sequences underscore its importance in developmental pathways and genetic regulatory networks (Ahlqvist2011A; Lima2019The; Nishina1999PAX6).

## Structure
The PAX6 gene encodes a transcription factor crucial for eye and brain development, characterized by its paired domain (PD) and homeodomain (HD), both of which are DNA-binding regions. The paired domain is divided into two subdomains: the amino-terminal subdomain (NTS) and the carboxyl-terminal subdomain (CTS), connected by a linker region. The NTS contains two extended β-sheets and three alpha helices, while the CTS primarily consists of three alpha helices. The NTS uses a helix-turn-helix motif to interact with the major groove of DNA, and a β-hairpin to contact the minor groove (Shukla2012Predictions; Xu1999Crystal).

The PAX6 protein undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in an isoform known as PAX6(5a), which includes a 14-amino-acid insertion in the paired domain. This insertion alters the DNA-binding properties, allowing the carboxyl-terminal subdomain to interact with DNA (Epstein1994Two). The crystal structure of the PAX6 paired domain-DNA complex reveals that the linker region and the carboxyl-terminal subdomain play specific roles in DNA binding, with the linker making extensive contacts in the minor groove (Xu1999Crystal).

## Function
The PAX6 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of various tissues, including the eyes, brain, and pancreas. In the eye, PAX6 is essential for ocular morphogenesis, influencing the development of structures such as the lens, cornea, and retina. It regulates the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, maintaining the non-keratinized state of the corneal epithelium and supporting normal ocular surface homeostasis (Li2007Down‐regulation; Nishina1999PAX6).

In the brain, PAX6 is involved in maintaining neural stem cells and promoting neuronal differentiation, which is vital for tissue repair and cognitive performance. It influences neurodegeneration processes and is linked to the maintenance of cortical thickness, particularly in the frontal and parietal lobes, which are important for memory functions (Yogarajah2016PAX6).

PAX6 also plays a significant role in pancreatic development and function, regulating genes involved in insulin secretion and glucose metabolism. It affects the differentiation of cells producing incretins and influences the expression of genes critical for pancreatic islet function (Ahlqvist2011A). The gene's activity is primarily nuclear, where it binds to DNA to control the expression of target genes involved in these developmental and maintenance processes (Salem2000PAX6).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PAX6 gene are associated with a range of ocular disorders, most notably aniridia, which is characterized by the congenital absence of the iris. Aniridia can also affect the cornea, lens, and retina, leading to conditions such as cataracts, glaucoma, and aniridia-related keratopathy (ARK) (Tzoulaki2005PAX6; Lima2019The). PAX6 mutations are also linked to microphthalmia, anophthalmia, and coloboma (MAC), which involve reduced size or absence of the ocular globe (Lima2019The). These mutations often disrupt PAX6-DNA interactions, particularly in the paired domain, affecting its regulatory functions (Williamson2020Recurrent).

Beyond ocular conditions, PAX6 mutations have been associated with systemic features, including neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, ADHD, and language impairments. They are also linked to malformations of the pineal and pituitary glands, obesity, and diabetes mellitus due to PAX6's role in pancreas development (Lima2019The). The gene's expression can be affected by chromosomal rearrangements, leading to broader phenotypic effects, including structural brain changes and olfactory deficits (van2002PAX6). Despite the wide range of conditions associated with PAX6 mutations, genotype-phenotype correlations remain complex and not fully understood (Yokoi2016Genotype–phenotype).

## Interactions
PAX6 is a transcription factor that engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in ocular and neurological development. It interacts with specific DNA sequences, such as the LE9 and LE11 elements, through its paired domain, which is essential for its autoregulatory functions in the Pax6 gene (Aota2003Pax6). PAX6 also forms complexes with other transcription factors like SOX2, co-binding to promoter elements in lens cells, which is critical for transcriptional regulation and ocular development (Williamson2020Recurrent).

The PAX6 protein interacts with several other proteins, including HOMER3, DNCL1, and TRIM11, through its C-terminal region and PST domain. These interactions are significant for synaptic signaling and intracellular transport, potentially linking synaptic activity to transcriptional changes in neurons (Cooper2005A). Mutations in the C-terminal region of PAX6 can disrupt these interactions, which may contribute to ocular anomalies (Cooper2005A).

PAX6's interactions with DNA and other proteins are vital for its role in regulating gene expression during development, influencing processes such as lens morphogenesis and neuronal differentiation (Sun2015Identification). These interactions underscore the importance of PAX6 in developmental pathways and its involvement in various genetic regulatory networks.
