# FCSK

## Overview
The FCSK gene encodes the enzyme fucose kinase, a critical component of the fucose salvage pathway. This enzyme is categorized as a kinase due to its role in phosphorylating free L-fucose to produce fucose-1-phosphate, a precursor in the synthesis of GDP-fucose. GDP-fucose is essential for fucosylation, a post-translational modification that affects glycoproteins and glycolipids, influencing various cellular processes such as cell-cell recognition and immune responses (Sosicka2019Therapeutic). FCSK is predominantly expressed in the liver, underscoring its importance in maintaining fucosylation levels, particularly when the de novo synthesis pathway is compromised (Sosicka2019Therapeutic). Mutations in the FCSK gene have been linked to severe developmental disorders, highlighting its significance in human health (Ondruskova2021Congenital).

## Function
FCSK (fucose kinase) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the salvage pathway of GDP-fucose synthesis. In this pathway, FCSK phosphorylates free L-fucose to produce fucose-1-phosphate, which is subsequently converted to GDP-fucose by guanylyltransferase (FPGT) (Sosicka2019Therapeutic). GDP-fucose is a critical donor substrate for fucosylation, a post-translational modification that is essential for the proper functioning of glycoproteins and glycolipids. This modification is vital for various cellular processes, including cell-cell recognition, signaling, and immune responses (Sosicka2019Therapeutic).

FCSK is highly expressed in the liver, indicating its significant role in the fucose salvage pathway in this organ (Sosicka2019Therapeutic). The enzyme's activity is primarily located in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to maintaining proper fucosylation levels, which are essential for various cellular functions. The salvage pathway, in which FCSK is involved, serves as an alternative to the de novo synthesis of GDP-fucose, which is primarily derived from glucose or mannose (Sosicka2019Therapeutic). This pathway is particularly important in conditions where the de novo pathway is insufficient or impaired, ensuring the availability of GDP-fucose for essential cellular functions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FCSK gene, which encodes fucokinase, have been associated with severe developmental disorders. Individuals with pathogenic variants in FCSK present with a range of clinical symptoms, including severe developmental delay, seizures, hypotonia, and brain anomalies such as cerebellar atrophy and agenesis of the corpus callosum. These patients also experience gastrointestinal and feeding difficulties, failure to thrive, recurrent respiratory infections, and ocular symptoms like strabismus, nystagmus, cortical blindness, optic nerve atrophy, and maculopathy. One patient exhibited a persistent increase in methylmalonic acid and homocysteine levels that did not normalize with B12 supplementation, suggesting a potential issue with B12 transport or activation (Ondruskova2021Congenital).

Despite reduced FCSK protein levels and activity in fibroblasts, no effect on total cellular fucosylation was observed, indicating that the salvage pathway might be more critical in some cell types than others (Ondruskova2021Congenital). This suggests that while FCSK mutations can lead to significant clinical manifestations, the impact on glycosylation may vary depending on the cell type, highlighting the complexity of its role in human health.
