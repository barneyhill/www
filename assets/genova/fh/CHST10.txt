# CHST10

## Overview
CHST10 is a gene that encodes the enzyme carbohydrate sulfotransferase 10, which is a member of the sulfotransferase family. This enzyme is involved in the sulfation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), specifically targeting the human natural killer-1 (HNK-1) carbohydrate. The sulfation process mediated by carbohydrate sulfotransferase 10 is crucial for various cellular functions, including cell survival, growth, migration, and differentiation. The enzyme is predominantly active in the Golgi apparatus, where it adds sulfate groups to carbohydrates, influencing the structure and function of proteoglycans. These modifications are essential for cell signaling, adhesion, and the organization of the extracellular matrix, with significant implications for neuronal recognition and synaptic plasticity (Wu2010Detection).

## Structure


## Function
CHST10, or carbohydrate sulfotransferase 10, is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the sulfation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), specifically targeting the human natural killer-1 (HNK-1) carbohydrate, a sulfated glucuronyl-lactosaminyl residue. This sulfation process is essential for various cellular functions, including cell survival, growth, migration, and differentiation (Wu2010Detection). CHST10 is responsible for the sulfation of nonreducing glucuronic acid, with a specific activity greater than 40 pmol/min/µg, indicating its efficiency in catalyzing this biochemical modification (Wu2010Detection).

The enzyme is primarily active in the Golgi apparatus, where it facilitates the addition of sulfate groups to carbohydrates, impacting the structure and function of proteoglycans. These modifications are crucial for cell signaling, adhesion, and the organization of the extracellular matrix. CHST10's activity is particularly significant in neuronal recognition and synaptic plasticity, suggesting its involvement in cell interactions during development and the maintenance of synaptic plasticity in adults (Wu2010Detection). In tissue studies, CHST10 has been shown to label specific glycans in the kidney, pancreas, and mucosal layers of the intestine, colon, and stomach, highlighting its role in glycan labeling in tissues where the HNK-1 epitope is present (Wu2010Detection).
