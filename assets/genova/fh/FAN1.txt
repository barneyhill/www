# FAN1

## Overview
FAN1 (FANCD2 and FANCI associated nuclease 1) is a gene that encodes a structure-specific nuclease protein involved in the repair of DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs), which are critical lesions that can impede DNA replication and transcription. The FAN1 protein plays a pivotal role in maintaining genomic stability by participating in the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway, where it is recruited to sites of DNA damage by the monoubiquitinated FANCI-FANCD2 complex. This recruitment is facilitated by its ubiquitin-binding zinc finger (UBZ) domain, although FAN1 can also function independently of the FA pathway. The protein's nuclease activity is essential for processing ICL-stalled replication fork-like structures, cleaving 5' flaps, and processing nicks made by other nucleases, effectively unhooking the ICL. FAN1 is expressed ubiquitously in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues, underscoring its importance in maintaining genomic integrity across various cell types (Thongthip2016Fan1; Deshmukh2021FAN1; Gwon2014Crystal).

## Structure
The FAN1 protein is a structure-selective nuclease involved in DNA repair, particularly in the Fanconi anemia pathway. It consists of several domains, each contributing to its function. The N-terminal domain (NTD) and the SAP domain form an elongated alpha/beta structure, with the NTD comprising four helices and three strands, while the SAP domain includes a short two-stranded sheet and four helices (Gwon2014Crystal). The TPR domain features a two-layered wall of helices, forming a concave structure that accommodates the post-nick duplex (Gwon2014Crystal). The VRR nuc domain is divided into a catalytic and a flap-binding subdomain, with a central five-stranded sheet flanked by helices, similar to type II restriction enzymes (Gwon2014Crystal).

FAN1 forms an asymmetrical dimer, crucial for engaging DNA lesions, unwinding the flap, and incising the unwound DNA intermediate (Zhao2014Structural). The dimerization is DNA-induced, with FAN1 being monomeric in solution until it binds to DNA (Zhao2014Structural). The active site of FAN1 is located 5 nucleotides downstream from the junction between the prenick and post-nick duplexes, with two Mn2+ ions playing a critical role in its nuclease activity (Gwon2014Crystal). The protein's structure is designed for specific interactions with DNA, with each domain playing a role in recognizing different parts of the DNA (Gwon2014Crystal).

## Function
FAN1 (FANCD2 and FANCI associated nuclease 1) is a crucial protein involved in the repair of DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs), which are significant lesions that can obstruct DNA replication and transcription. In healthy human cells, FAN1 plays a vital role in maintaining genomic stability by participating in the repair of these ICLs. It functions as a structure-specific nuclease, recognizing aberrant DNA conformations rather than specific sequences, and is involved in resolving damaged DNA and unusual DNA structures that arise during replication, recombination, and transcription (Thongthip2016Fan1; Deshmukh2021FAN1).

FAN1 is recruited to sites of DNA damage by the monoubiquitinated FANCI-FANCD2 complex, a key component of the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway. This recruitment is facilitated by its ubiquitin-binding zinc finger (UBZ) domain, although FAN1 can also function independently of the FA pathway (Thongthip2016Fan1; Gwon2014Crystal). The protein's nuclease activity is essential for processing ICL-stalled replication fork-like structures, cleaving 5' flaps, and processing nicks made by other nucleases, effectively unhooking the ICL (Thongthip2016Fan1).

FAN1 is expressed ubiquitously in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues, highlighting its importance in maintaining genomic integrity across various cell types (Deshmukh2021FAN1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FAN1 gene are associated with several diseases, most notably karyomegalic interstitial nephritis (KIN), a rare hereditary kidney disorder. KIN is characterized by chronic interstitial nephritis, renal fibrosis, and the presence of enlarged polyploid nuclei in renal tubular epithelial cells. This condition typically leads to end-stage renal dysfunction in early adulthood (Thongthip2016Fan1; Császár2024Phenotypic; Deshmukh2021FAN1). FAN1 mutations are the only known genetic cause of KIN, and the disease follows an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern (Thongthip2016Fan1; Law2020Karyomegalic).

In addition to KIN, FAN1 mutations have been implicated in other conditions, including cancer, autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, epilepsy, and Rett syndrome (Deshmukh2021FAN1). The gene's role in DNA interstrand cross-link (ICL) repair is crucial, and deficiencies in this function can lead to genomic instability, contributing to these diseases (Thongthip2016Fan1; Lachaud2016Karyomegalic).

Interestingly, individuals with homozygous 15q13.3 microdeletions encompassing FAN1 do not exhibit KIN but may present with developmental delays or intellectual disabilities, suggesting that the gene's interactions and expression levels can influence a range of clinical outcomes (Deshmukh2021FAN1).

## Interactions
FAN1, a DNA repair nuclease, engages in several critical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids to facilitate DNA repair processes. It forms a complex with FANCD2 and the BLM helicase at stalled replication forks, promoting fork recovery and suppressing new origin firing. This interaction does not require the UBZ domain of FAN1, but its chromatin localization depends on non-ubiquitylated FANCD2 (Deshmukh2021FAN1). FAN1 also interacts with ubiquitylated PCNA through a non-canonical PIP box and a UBZ domain, which is crucial for its recruitment to stalled replication forks and for alleviating replication stress (Porro2017FAN1).

FAN1's interaction with ubiquitylated PCNA is essential for processing replication-blocking lesions and maintaining genomic integrity. This interaction is facilitated by the UBZ domain and a PIP motif, which are necessary for FAN1's localization to replication stress sites (Porro2017FAN1). FAN1 also interacts with MutLα, potentially functioning as a compensatory nuclease in mismatch repair in the absence of EXO1 (Deshmukh2021FAN1). Additionally, FAN1's interaction with RPA-coated 5′-flapped DNA is crucial for DNA incision at stalled replication forks, indicating a coordinated role in the ICL repair pathway (Takahashi2015Human).
