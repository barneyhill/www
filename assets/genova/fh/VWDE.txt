# VWDE

## Overview
The VWDE gene encodes a protein that is characterized by the presence of von Willebrand factor D and EGF-like domains, which are integral to its function in the extracellular matrix. This protein is primarily involved in cell adhesion and signaling, contributing to the structural integrity of tissues and playing a significant role in processes such as angiogenesis and wound healing. As a component of the extracellular matrix, the VWDE protein is crucial for maintaining vascular health and facilitating tissue repair. The gene's expression can be influenced by environmental factors, such as exposure to pollutants, and it may also be involved in epigenetic regulation, as suggested by its association with DNA methylation changes due to trauma exposure (Musanabaganwa2021Leukocyte; Ghosh2011Global). Despite these insights, the full spectrum of VWDE's functions in normal cellular contexts remains to be comprehensively understood.

## Structure


## Function
The VWDE gene encodes a protein characterized by von Willebrand factor D and EGF-like domains, which are involved in cell adhesion, signaling, and maintaining the structural integrity of tissues. This protein is active in the extracellular matrix and plays a role in processes such as angiogenesis and wound healing, contributing to vascular health and tissue repair. In healthy human cells, the VWDE protein is implicated in the regulation of these processes, although specific details about its function in normal cellular contexts are not extensively documented in the available literature.

The gene has been studied in various contexts, including its response to environmental factors and its potential role in genetic diversity. For instance, the VWDE gene was found to be up-regulated in response to PCB 138 exposure, indicating its involvement in cellular responses to environmental stressors (Ghosh2011Global). Additionally, the gene has been associated with intergenerational transmission of DNA methylation changes due to trauma exposure, suggesting a role in epigenetic regulation (Musanabaganwa2021Leukocyte). These findings highlight the gene's potential involvement in complex biological processes, although its precise functions in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated.
