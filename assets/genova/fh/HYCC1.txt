# HYCC1

## Overview
HYCC1, also known as FAM126A, is a gene that encodes the protein hyccin PI4KA lipid kinase complex subunit 1, which is integral to lipid signaling pathways. This protein functions as a subunit within the phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase alpha (PI4KA) complex, playing a pivotal role in the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI(4)P) at the plasma membrane. As a component of this complex, hyccin is involved in critical cellular processes such as membrane trafficking and signal transduction, particularly in the context of oligodendrocyte myelination. The protein's interactions with other components, such as phosphatidylinositol-4 kinase 3 alpha (PI4K3alpha) and TTC7B, facilitate its recruitment to the plasma membrane and its function in lipid exchange between cellular compartments (Torii2023Molecular). Mutations in the HYCC1 gene are linked to hypomyelinating leukodystrophy type 5 (HLD5), underscoring its significance in neurological health and disease (Torii2023Molecular).

## Function
HYCC1, also known as FAM126A, plays a crucial role in lipid signaling pathways as a subunit of the PI4KA complex. This complex is essential for the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI(4)P) at the plasma membrane, a lipid that is vital for membrane trafficking and signaling processes. In healthy human cells, HYCC1 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and is involved in the recruitment of a complex that includes phosphatidylinositol-4 kinase 3 alpha (PI4K3alpha) and TTC7B to the plasma membrane. This complex also involves oxysterol-binding protein-related proteins (ORP5 and ORP8), which regulate the contact between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the plasma membrane, facilitating the exchange of PI(4)P and phosphatidylserine (PS) (Torii2023Molecular).

These lipids are important components of oligodendrocyte myelin, indicating that HYCC1 plays a role in oligodendrocyte myelination through lipid synthesis and associated signal transduction. The proper functioning of HYCC1 is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function, as it contributes to processes like vesicle formation and transport within the Golgi apparatus and other cellular membranes (Torii2023Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HYCC1 gene, also known as Hyccin/FAM126A/DRCTNNB1A, are associated with hypomyelinating leukodystrophy type 5 (HLD5), a rare genetic disorder characterized by a deficit in myelin formation in the brain. This condition leads to congenital cerebral hypomyelination, motor deficits, and other neurological symptoms (Torii2023Molecular). The HYCC1 gene interacts with phosphatidylinositol-4 kinase 3 alpha (PI4K3alpha) and is crucial for the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI(4)P) at the plasma membrane. Dysfunction in this gene affects oligodendrocyte myelination through disrupted lipid synthesis and signal transduction, contributing to the pathogenesis of HLD5 (Torii2023Molecular).

In particular, the FAM126 L53P mutant of the HYCC1 gene accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), leading to decreased expression of myelin basic protein (MBP) in the corpus callosum, which indicates abnormal myelination (Torii2023Molecular). This highlights the critical role of HYCC1 in maintaining normal myelin formation and its impact on neurological health when mutated. The gene's involvement in lipid kinase activity and cellular signaling underscores its importance in maintaining proper membrane dynamics and neurological function.

## Interactions
HYCC1, also known as FAM126A, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It forms a complex with phosphatidylinositol-4 kinase 3 alpha (PI4K3alpha) and TTC7B, which is essential for its recruitment to the plasma membrane. This complex plays a significant role in the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI(4)P) at the plasma membrane and is involved in the regulation of contact between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the plasma membrane, facilitating the exchange of PI(4)P and phosphatidylserine (PS) (Torii2023Molecular).

In the context of pancreatic cancer, FAM126A interacts with the ENO1 protein, a key activator of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This interaction has been confirmed through co-localization and co-immunoprecipitation assays. The overexpression of FAM126A promotes cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, and induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The interaction between FAM126A and ENO1 is crucial for these oncogenic activities, as ENO1 knockdown reverses the effects of FAM126A overexpression (Li2022FAM126A).
