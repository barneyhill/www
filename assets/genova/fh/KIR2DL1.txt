# KIR2DL1

## Overview
KIR2DL1 is a gene that encodes the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor, two Ig domains and long cytoplasmic tail 1, a transmembrane receptor primarily expressed on the surface of natural killer (NK) cells. This receptor is a member of the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) family, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the immune system. The protein encoded by KIR2DL1 is characterized by its two immunoglobulin-like domains and a long cytoplasmic tail containing immunoreceptor-tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs), which are essential for transmitting inhibitory signals to NK cells. These signals are crucial for maintaining immune tolerance by preventing NK cells from attacking healthy cells, thus playing a significant role in immune regulation and preventing autoimmunity (Chrul2006Influence; Boyington2002A). The interaction of KIR2DL1 with specific HLA-C alleles, such as HLA-Cw4, is vital for NK cell education and functional competence, influencing immune responses in various clinical contexts, including autoimmune diseases, cancer, and viral infections (Fan2001Crystal; Lisovsky2019Differential).

## Structure
KIR2DL1 is a member of the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) family, characterized by its two immunoglobulin-like domains, D1 and D2, which are arranged in a tilted side-by-side manner with a hinge region (Joyce2011The). The primary structure of KIR2DL1 includes a long cytoplasmic tail containing immunoreceptor-tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIM), which are crucial for its inhibitory signaling function (Boyington2002A). 

The secondary structure of KIR2DL1 is dominated by beta sheets, typical of immunoglobulin domains, as confirmed by CD spectrum analysis (Sasaki2009Silkworm). The tertiary structure features a specificity pocket formed by Met 44 and other conserved residues, which allows for specific interactions with the Lys 80 residue of HLA-Cw4 (Fan2001Crystal). 

KIR2DL1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including N-glycosylation, which is not sensitive to EndoH treatment, indicating specific sugar modifications (Sasaki2009Silkworm). The protein's quaternary structure involves forming a complex with HLA-Cw4, characterized by charge and shape complementarity, with a shape correlation statistic (Sc) of 0.71, indicating high shape complementarity (Fan2001Crystal). 

These structural features are essential for the receptor's role in immune regulation, particularly in recognizing and binding to specific HLA-C alleles.

## Function
KIR2DL1 is an inhibitory receptor expressed on the surface of natural killer (NK) cells, playing a crucial role in the immune system by interacting with HLA-C2 ligands. This interaction is essential for the education and functional competence of NK cells, a process known as licensing, which enhances their ability to respond to immune challenges (Sim2015KIR2DL3; Lisovsky2019Differential). KIR2DL1 transmits inhibitory signals that prevent NK cells from attacking healthy cells, thus maintaining immune tolerance and preventing autoimmunity (Chrul2006Influence).

The expression of KIR2DL1 is influenced by genetic variability, including allele subtype and copy number, which affects the frequency of KIR2DL1+ NK cells in individuals (Le2019Novel). KIR2DL1 is expressed in a primarily monoallelic fashion, with co-expression of different isoforms being rare (Le2019Novel). The receptor's inhibitory function can be modulated by activating signals from other receptors, such as KIR2DS1, highlighting the complex regulation of NK cell activity (Le2019Novel). KIR2DL1's role in NK cell education and activation is significant in contexts such as antibody-dependent NK cell activation (ADNKA) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), although its impact on ADCC activity is modest (Lisovsky2019Differential).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the KIR2DL1 gene have been associated with various diseases and conditions. Variations in KIR2DL1 expression can influence susceptibility to autoimmune diseases, such as psoriasis. In particular, the KIR2DL1 gene has been observed as a protective factor in Asian populations with psoriasis vulgaris, although no significant differences were found in Brazilian Caucasian populations with guttate psoriasis (MacíasBarragán2020Assessment).

In the context of cancer and viral infections, the interactions between KIR2DL1 and its ligands are crucial. The presence of specific alleles, such as KIR2DL1*004, which is poorly expressed, can affect the receptor's ability to recognize HLA-C2 ligands, potentially impacting immune responses in diseases like cancer (Dubreuil2021Relevance).

Alterations in KIR2DL1 expression have also been linked to myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Patients with TET2 and IDH mutations exhibit significantly reduced KIR2DL1 expression on NK cells, which may affect immune surveillance and response in these conditions (Boy2023Myelodysplastic).

The presence of arginine at position 245 in the KIR2DL1 transmembrane domain is crucial for maintaining its inhibitory function. Alleles lacking this arginine, such as KIR2DL1*00401, show weaker inhibitory effects, which may influence disease risk and immune regulation (Bari2009Significant).

## Interactions
KIR2DL1 interacts with HLA-C molecules, specifically HLA-Cw4, forming a complex that is characterized by charge and shape complementarity. This interaction involves KIR2DL1 binding orthogonally to the HLA-Cw4 peptide-binding groove, engaging with both the α1 and α2-domain helices and the COOH-terminal portion of the bound peptide. The interface is marked by specific interactions, such as salt bridges between basic residues of HLA-Cw4 and acidic residues of KIR2DL1, including a notable salt bridge between Lys 80 of HLA-Cw4 and Glu 187 of KIR2DL1 (Fan2001Crystal).

KIR2DL1 also forms a crystallographic dimer with HLA-Cw4, involving significant interactions between the D1 domain of KIR2DL1 and the α1 helix of HLA-Cw4. This dimerization may have implications for KIR clustering at the cell surface, although its physiological relevance remains uncertain (Fan2001Crystal).

Additionally, KIR2DL1 interacts with supervillin, an F-actin binding protein, which is essential for the inhibitory signaling of natural killer cells. This interaction is dependent on the phosphorylation of tyrosines in the ITIM motifs of KIR2DL1, facilitating the recruitment of SHP-2 phosphatase to the receptor (Liu2011Association).
