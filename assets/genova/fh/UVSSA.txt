# UVSSA

## Overview
The UVSSA gene encodes the UV-stimulated scaffold protein A, a critical component of the transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) pathway. This protein plays a pivotal role in the cellular response to UV-induced DNA damage by facilitating the repair of transcription-blocking lesions on the transcribed strand of active genes. UVSSA functions as a scaffold protein, interacting with key repair factors such as RNA polymerase II, CSA, CSB, and the TFIIH complex, to stabilize and coordinate the repair machinery at sites of DNA damage (van2019The; Schwertman2013UVSSA). Additionally, UVSSA's interaction with the deubiquitinating enzyme USP7 is crucial for preventing the degradation of Cockayne Syndrome protein B (CSB), thereby ensuring efficient DNA repair (Higa2018Inhibition; Schwertman2013UVSSA). Mutations in the UVSSA gene are linked to UV-sensitive syndrome, underscoring its essential role in maintaining genomic stability and preventing UV-induced cellular dysfunction (Ijaz2019UVsensitive; Sarasin2012UVSSA).

## Structure


## Function
The UVSSA gene encodes the UV-stimulated scaffold protein A, which plays a crucial role in the transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) pathway. This pathway is essential for repairing transcription-blocking DNA lesions that occur on the transcribed strand of active genes, particularly following UV-induced damage (Sarasin2012UVSSA; Schwertman2013UVSSA). UVSSA interacts with several key proteins, including the deubiquitinating enzyme USP7, to stabilize the Cockayne Syndrome protein B (CSB) and prevent its degradation, thereby facilitating the repair process (Higa2018Inhibition; Schwertman2013UVSSA).

The protein contains two important domains: the VHS domain, which is involved in interactions with CSA and RNA polymerase II, and the DUF2043 domain, which is crucial for recruitment to DNA damage sites (Wienholz2019FACT; Sarasin2012UVSSA). UVSSA's interaction with RNA polymerase II is important for processing stalled transcription complexes and recycling RNA polymerase II for new rounds of transcription (Schwertman2013UVSSA). In healthy human cells, UVSSA helps maintain genomic stability by ensuring efficient repair of transcription-blocking lesions, thus preventing cellular dysfunction and diseases such as UV-sensitive syndrome (Wienholz2019FACT; Ijaz2019UVsensitive).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the UVSSA gene are associated with UV-sensitive syndrome (UVSS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by hypersensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) light and mild skin abnormalities such as freckling and pigmentation changes. Unlike other photosensitivity disorders, UVSS does not predispose individuals to skin cancer or neurological abnormalities (Higa2018Inhibition; Ijaz2019UVsensitive). The condition results from defects in the transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) pathway, which is crucial for repairing UV-induced DNA damage (Schwertman2013UVSSA).

Mutations in UVSSA can lead to its rapid degradation due to disrupted interactions with ubiquitin-specific peptidase 7 (USP7), impairing TC-NER and resulting in UVSS (Higa2018Inhibition; Schwertman2013UVSSA). Specific mutations, such as a missense mutation in the VHS domain (p.Cys32Arg), have been identified in UVSS patients, affecting the protein's ability to interact with other TC-NER factors (Guo2018Disorders; Ijaz2019UVsensitive).

In some cases, UVSSA mutations have been linked to a Cockayne syndrome-like phenotype, suggesting a broader spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with UVSSA gene alterations (Bahap2024A). This highlights the importance of UVSSA in maintaining DNA repair processes and its role in preventing UV-induced damage.

## Interactions
The UVSSA protein is integral to the transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) pathway, interacting with several key proteins to facilitate DNA repair. UVSSA interacts with RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), CSA, CSB, and the TFIIH complex, forming part of the chromatin-bound TC-NER complexes that respond to UV-induced DNA damage (van2019The; Schwertman2013UVSSA). It is recruited to lesion-stalled RNAPII independently of CSA and CSB, although its interaction with CSA may stabilize the TC-NER complex (Wienholz2019FACT).

UVSSA also interacts with USP7, a deubiquitylating enzyme, which stabilizes CSB by removing ubiquitin, thus promoting efficient DNA repair (Zhu2019USP7mediated; Sarasin2012UVSSA). The DUF2043 domain of UVSSA is essential for its recruitment to sites of DNA damage and for interactions with various proteins, including the FACT subunits Spt16 and SSRP1, and U2 and U5 snRNP splicing factors (Wienholz2019FACT).

The interaction with TFIIH is facilitated by a specific region within UVSSA, and this interaction is crucial for the recruitment of TFIIH to DNA damage-stalled RNAPIIo (van2019The). UVSSA's interactions with CSA and TFIIH are essential for stabilizing the TFIIH complex at the site of DNA damage, ensuring effective repair (van2020The).
