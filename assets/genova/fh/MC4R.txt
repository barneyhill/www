# MC4R

## Overview
The MC4R gene encodes the melanocortin 4 receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of energy homeostasis and body weight. This receptor is primarily expressed in the central nervous system, particularly within the hypothalamus, where it integrates signals related to energy balance and appetite control. The MC4R protein is characterized by a seven-transmembrane helical structure typical of GPCRs, and it is activated by melanocortin peptides such as α-MSH and β-MSH, while being antagonized by agouti-related protein (AgRP) (Fatima2022Molecular; Tao2010The). Mutations in the MC4R gene are the most common monogenic cause of obesity, highlighting its clinical significance in metabolic disorders (Farooqi2000Dominant). The receptor's function is modulated by various interactions, including those with the melanocortin receptor accessory protein 2 (MRAP2) and the inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir7.1, which contribute to its complex regulatory mechanisms (GhamariLangroudi2015Gproteinindependent; Zhang2017The).

## Structure
The melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a classical seven-transmembrane helical structure, typical of GPCRs (Fatima2022Molecular). The primary structure of MC4R consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the receptor protein, which is involved in energy homeostasis and appetite regulation (Fatima2022Molecular). The secondary structure includes alpha helices that span the cell membrane, forming the transmembrane domains (Israeli2021Structure).

The tertiary structure of MC4R involves the folding of these helices into a functional receptor, with a unique open extracellular region containing an exposed cavity. This is due to a short extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) and the absence of a disulfide bond commonly found in other class-A GPCRs (Israeli2021Structure). Instead, MC4R has disulfide bonds linking the N-terminus to TM7 and ECL3 to TM6 (Israeli2021Structure).

Calcium ions play a crucial role in the receptor's function, enhancing the binding affinity and potency of ligands (Yu2020Determination). Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation may affect MC4R's function, although specific details are not provided in the context. Splice variants of MC4R may exist, potentially altering receptor activity (Fatima2022Molecular).

## Function
The melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a critical role in regulating energy homeostasis and body weight in humans. It is primarily expressed in the central nervous system, particularly in the hypothalamus, where it integrates signals related to energy balance. MC4R is activated by agonists such as α-MSH and β-MSH, which are derived from the pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gene, and is antagonized by agouti-related protein (AgRP) (Hinney2013Melanocortin4; Tao2010The).

Upon activation, MC4R primarily couples with the stimulatory G protein (Gs), leading to increased production of cyclic AMP (cAMP) and activation of protein kinase A (PKA), which are crucial for its role in energy homeostasis (Tao2010The). MC4R can also couple with Gi/o proteins to decrease cAMP levels, providing a mechanism for fine-tuning its signaling (Tao2010The). Additionally, MC4R activation can lead to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, specifically ERK1/2, which is necessary for the suppression of food intake (Tao2010The).

MC4R's role extends to influencing metabolic processes, such as enhancing insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and improving insulin tolerance by interacting with insulin signaling pathways (Tao2010The). Its activity is crucial for maintaining energy balance, and disruptions in its function are associated with obesity (Rodrigues2014Intracellular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MC4R gene are the most common monogenic cause of human obesity, particularly associated with early-onset obesity. These mutations can lead to a condition characterized by hyperphagia, increased linear growth, hyperinsulinemia, and increased bone mineral density (Kühnen2019Melanocortin4; Farooqi2000Dominant). The prevalence of MC4R mutations varies across populations, with up to 6% of early-onset morbidly obese British Caucasians affected, while lower rates are observed in other groups (Tao2010The). 

MC4R mutations can be inherited in either a dominant or recessive pattern, with heterozygous mutations often leading to severe obesity, although not all carriers are obese, indicating incomplete penetrance (Vaisse2000Melanocortin4; Farooqi2000Dominant). The expressivity of obesity associated with these mutations is variable and not always correlated with the functional severity of the mutations (Vaisse2000Melanocortin4). 

Certain polymorphisms in MC4R, such as V103I and I251L, are associated with resistance to obesity, suggesting a complex relationship between MC4R variants and obesity risk (Tao2010The). The impact of MC4R mutations on obesity is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, affecting the success of lifestyle interventions (Tao2010The).

## Interactions
The melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) is involved in several interactions with other proteins that influence its function in energy homeostasis and appetite regulation. MC4R interacts with the melanocortin receptor accessory protein 2 (MRAP2), which modulates its activity. MRAP2 can enhance the sensitivity of MC4R to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and fine-tune its activity and ligand sensitivity. It also reduces the potency of the agouti-related protein (AgRP) in inhibiting MC4R's constitutive activity, although it does not affect AgRP's ability to antagonize α-MSH/ACTH actions (Zhang2017The).

MC4R also interacts with the inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir7.1 in a G-protein-independent manner. This interaction is modulated by α-MSH and AgRP, where α-MSH decreases Kir7.1 channel activity, leading to neuron depolarization, while AgRP increases channel activity, resulting in hyperpolarization. This mechanism highlights a novel pathway for MC4R-mediated signaling that does not rely on traditional G-protein pathways (GhamariLangroudi2015Gproteinindependent).

These interactions underscore the complex regulatory mechanisms involving MC4R, which are crucial for maintaining energy balance and regulating food intake.
