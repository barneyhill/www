# LTB

## Overview
Lymphotoxin beta (LTB) is a gene that encodes the lymphotoxin beta (LTβ) protein, a type II transmembrane protein that is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily. LTβ plays a pivotal role in the immune system, particularly in the development and organization of lymphoid tissues. It forms a heteromeric complex with lymphotoxin alpha (LTα), which is crucial for the proper functioning of the immune response, including the formation of secondary lymphoid organs and the regulation of immune cell interactions. The LTα-LTβ complex interacts with the lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTβR), initiating signaling pathways that are essential for immune homeostasis and the development of dendritic cells. Alterations in LTB expression have been associated with various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, as well as certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Tumanov2003Dissecting; Bolstad2012Association; BROWNING1993Lymphotoxin).

## Structure
Lymphotoxin beta (LTβ) is a type II membrane protein with a sequence of 240-244 amino acids and a molecular mass of 25-26 kDa. It features a short N-terminal cytoplasmic domain followed by a hydrophobic membrane-anchoring domain (BROWNING1993Lymphotoxin). The protein is glycosylated, which contributes to its size difference compared to the encoded protein (BROWNING1993Lymphotoxin). LTβ shares structural similarities with other TNF family members, particularly in the extracellular domain, and is 21-24% identical to TNF, LTα, and the CD40 ligand in certain regions (BROWNING1993Lymphotoxin).

LTβ forms a heteromeric complex with lymphotoxin alpha (LTα) on the cell surface, retaining a trimeric structure similar to TNF and LTα (BROWNING1993Lymphotoxin). The LTα-LTβ complex primarily exists as a dimer with a possible stoichiometry of α1:β2 (BROWNING1993Lymphotoxin). The conserved regions in TNF family proteins, including LTβ, are primarily located on internal β strands, which are crucial for stabilizing the oligomeric structure and may contribute to receptor specificity (BROWNING1993Lymphotoxin). The glycosylation site in LTβ is similar to that in the CD40 ligand but differs from LTα (BROWNING1993Lymphotoxin).

## Function
Lymphotoxin beta (LTB) is a crucial component of the lymphotoxin complex, which plays a significant role in the development and organization of lymphoid tissues. LTB is involved in signaling pathways that regulate immune responses and inflammation, contributing to the maintenance of secondary lymphoid organs. In particular, LTB is essential for the proper formation of follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) and germinal centers (GCs) in the spleen, which are vital for generating a humoral immune response (Tumanov2003Dissecting). 

In B-cell-specific LTB-deficient mice, the spleen's microarchitecture is significantly affected, with a reduction in germinal centers and disruption of the marginal zone, leading to impaired immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses (Tumanov2003Dissecting). LTB also plays a role in the expression of chemokines necessary for the compartmentalization of lymphocytes, which is crucial for the organization of lymphoid tissue compartments (Ngo1999Lymphotoxin). 

The lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTβR) signaling is important for the homeostasis and development of dendritic cells (DCs) in lymphoid tissues, particularly CD8− DCs in the spleen, highlighting the role of LTB in immune cell regulation (Kabashima2005Intrinsic).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LTB gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. In primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS), a chronic autoimmune disease, there is a strong up-regulation of the LTB gene in the salivary glands of patients. This suggests a role for LTB in the disease's pathogenesis, especially in antibody-positive patients (Bolstad2012Association). The study of genetic variants in the LTA/LTB/TNF locus has shown significant associations with pSS, indicating that these genetic alterations may contribute to the susceptibility to this autoimmune condition (Bolstad2012Association).

In the context of cancer, particularly head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), alterations in LTB and its receptor have been linked to the activation of the alternative NF-κB signaling pathway. This pathway promotes metastatic gene expression and cell migration, contributing to cancer progression. Genomic and expression alterations of LTB and related signaling molecules have been observed in HNSCC tissues, suggesting a role in the disease's pathogenesis (Das2018Lymphotoxin‐β). These findings highlight the clinical significance of LTB in both autoimmune diseases and cancer, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
Lymphotoxin beta (LTβ) forms a heteromeric complex with lymphotoxin alpha (LTα) on the cell surface, which is crucial for targeting LTα to the cell surface and retaining a trimeric structure similar to TNF and LTα (BROWNING1993Lymphotoxin). This LTα-LTβ complex interacts with the lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTβR), which is essential for various immune functions, including the activation of NF-κB transcription factors (Ware2005NETWORK). The LTβR pathway involves TRAF proteins, particularly TRAF2 and TRAF3, which play significant roles in signal transduction, although their genetic deletion does not mimic LT deficiency, indicating complex interactions (Ware2005NETWORK).

LTβ is also involved in the formation of lymphoid structures and the organization of lymphoid tissues, such as Peyer’s patches, through its interaction with LTβR (Ware2005NETWORK). The LTα-LTβ complex does not bind to the two known TNF receptors, suggesting it has unique immunoregulatory functions that cannot be mimicked by the LTα homotrimer (BROWNING1993Lymphotoxin). Additionally, LTβ interacts with transcription factors CREB and YY1 within its gene region, which may influence the broader TNF locus (Wicks2011Transcriptional).
