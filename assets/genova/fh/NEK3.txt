# NEK3

## Overview
NEK3, or NIMA-related kinase 3, is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase involved in various cellular processes, including cilia and microtubule dynamics, cytoskeletal reorganization, and cell cycle progression. The protein product of NEK3, NIMA-related kinase 3, is a member of the NIMA-related kinase family, characterized by a conserved serine/threonine protein kinase domain. This kinase plays a crucial role in regulating cilia structure and function, which is essential for proper embryonic development and cellular signaling pathways. NEK3 is particularly significant in the context of breast cancer, where it influences cell motility and invasion through interactions with Vav proteins and the human prolactin receptor (Miller2005Novel). Mutations in the NEK3 gene have been associated with cilia-related disorders, such as situs inversus and heterotaxy, due to its impact on microtubule dynamics and nuclear pore complex components (Zhang2020Biallelic). Additionally, NEK3 overexpression is linked to poor prognosis in certain cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Peres2020Checking).

## Structure
NEK3 is a serine/threonine kinase that is part of the NIMA-related kinase family. The primary structure of NEK3 includes a serine/threonine protein kinase domain located in the N-terminal half of the protein, which is a common feature among NIMA-related kinases (Tanaka1999Cloning). NEK3 also contains two predicted PEST motifs, which are involved in protein stability and interactions (Harrington2016Identification). 

The secondary structure of NEK3 is not explicitly detailed in the available sources, but the presence of a kinase domain suggests typical structural elements such as alpha helices and beta sheets. The tertiary structure includes a conserved kinase domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Chang2009The).

NEK3 undergoes post-translational modifications, notably phosphorylation at specific threonine residues, which regulate its activity. Phosphorylation at Thr475 within the C-terminal PEST domain is critical for NEK3's function in neurons, affecting microtubule acetylation and neuronal morphology (Chang2009The). Another important phosphorylation site is Thr-165, which is involved in focal adhesion remodeling necessary for breast cancer cell migration (Harrington2016Identification).

There is no specific information on the quaternary structure or splice variant isoforms of NEK3 in the provided context.

## Function
NEK3 (NIMA related kinase 3) is a serine/threonine kinase involved in several critical cellular processes, particularly those related to cilia and microtubule dynamics. In healthy human cells, NEK3 plays a significant role in regulating cilia structure and function, which is essential for proper left-right asymmetry during embryonic development (Zhang2020Biallelic). NEK3 influences microtubule dynamics through the acetylation of α-tubulin, a process crucial for maintaining cilia stability and function (Zhang2020Biallelic). 

NEK3 is also involved in the regulation of actin polymerization, which is vital for cytoskeletal reorganization (Zhang2020Biallelic). It modulates signaling pathways through its interaction with Vav proteins, influencing cellular responses to prolactin, which is important for cell motility and cytoskeletal organization (Miller2005Novel). NEK3's kinase activity is crucial for the phosphorylation of Vav2, affecting GDP-GTP exchange activity toward Rho/Rac proteins, which are involved in cytoskeletal dynamics and cell migration (Miller2005Novel).

In addition to its role in cilia and cytoskeletal dynamics, NEK3 is implicated in maintaining proper chromatid segregation during cell division, ensuring accurate cell cycle progression (Zhang2020Biallelic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NEK3 gene have been linked to cilia-related disorders, particularly affecting cardiac left-right (LR) patterning. Biallelic loss-of-function mutations in NEK3 can lead to conditions such as situs inversus and heterotaxy, which are associated with laterality disorders and congenital heart diseases. These mutations result in a premature stop codon, leading to the abrogation of NEK3 protein levels, which disrupts cilia biogenesis and microtubule dynamics (Zhang2020Biallelic).

NEK3 deficiency is associated with the downregulation of key components of the nuclear pore complex, such as NUP205, NUP188, and NUP155, which are essential for nuclear assembly and nuclear envelope formation. This downregulation is significant in the context of cilia-related cardiac abnormalities (Zhang2020Biallelic). NEK3 mutations also lead to the upregulation of NNMT and SIRT2, which are involved in the deacetylation of α-tubulin, further affecting cilia structure and function (Zhang2020Biallelic).

In cancer, NEK3 is overexpressed in breast and gastric cancers, where it is associated with poor prognosis and increased tumor aggressiveness. Its overexpression is linked to breast cancer cell migration and invasion, as well as poor overall survival in gastric cancer (Peres2020Checking).

## Interactions
NEK3, a serine/threonine kinase, is involved in several protein interactions that play significant roles in breast cancer cell signaling and motility. NEK3 interacts with the Vav family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors, specifically Vav1 and Vav2, in a prolactin (PRL)-dependent manner. This interaction is crucial for the activation of Rac1, a member of the Rho family of GTPases, which is important for cytoskeletal reorganization and cell motility (Miller2005Novel). NEK3 also interacts with the human prolactin receptor (hPRLr), enhancing its kinase activity and leading to increased phosphorylation of Vav2, which is necessary for Rac1 activation (Miller2005Novel).

NEK3 is phosphorylated at threonine 165 (Thr-165) by ERK1/2, a process that is essential for focal adhesion remodeling and cell migration. This phosphorylation occurs independently of NEK3's catalytic activity and is linked to changes in focal adhesion morphology (Harrington2016Identification). NEK3 also interacts with β1 integrin and paxillin, influencing cell adhesion and migration dynamics, which are critical for breast cancer cell motility (Miller2007Nek3; Harrington2016Identification). These interactions highlight NEK3's role in modulating signaling pathways that affect cell survival, proliferation, and motility in breast cancer cells.
