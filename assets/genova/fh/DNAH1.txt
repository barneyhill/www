# DNAH1

## Overview
DNAH1 (dynein axonemal heavy chain 1) is a gene that encodes a protein component of the axonemal dynein motor complex, which is integral to the function of motile cilia and flagella. The protein, categorized as a motor protein, is involved in generating the force necessary for the movement of these cellular structures, playing a pivotal role in processes such as respiratory function and sperm motility (Ben2014Mutations). DNAH1 is particularly crucial in the structural organization and function of sperm flagella, where it contributes to the integrity of the axonemal structure (Ben2014Mutations). Mutations in the DNAH1 gene are linked to multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF), leading to male infertility due to impaired sperm motility (Ben2014Mutations). While DNAH1 is expressed in various ciliated cells, its dysfunction primarily manifests as infertility, distinguishing it from conditions like primary ciliary dyskinesia, which also affects respiratory function (Wang2016Homozygous).

## Structure
DNAH1 (dynein axonemal heavy chain 1) is a component of the dynein motor protein complex, which plays a crucial role in ciliary and flagellar movement. The primary structure of DNAH1 consists of a long polypeptide chain with ATPase activity, essential for its motor function (Imtiaz2015Variation). The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the formation of its motor domain and tail domain in the tertiary structure. This folding is critical for the protein's function in generating movement within cilia and flagella (Imtiaz2015Variation).

In terms of quaternary structure, DNAH1 assembles with intermediate and light chains to form the functional dynein complex, which is necessary for its role in motility (Imtiaz2015Variation). DNAH1 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation, which can influence its activity and interactions within the axonemal structure (Imtiaz2015Variation). The gene also has several splice variant isoforms, which may contribute to its functional diversity in different cellular contexts (Imtiaz2015Variation). These structural features enable DNAH1 to fulfill its role in the dynein motor complex, facilitating the movement of cilia and flagella.

## Function
The DNAH1 gene encodes an inner arm heavy chain dynein, a crucial component of the axonemal dynein motor protein complex. This complex is essential for the proper functioning of cilia and flagella, which are hair-like structures that protrude from the surface of many eukaryotic cells (Ben2014Mutations). In healthy human cells, DNAH1 is involved in the generation of force and movement in cilia and flagella, contributing to processes like respiratory function and sperm motility (Ben2014Mutations).

In sperm cells, DNAH1 plays a critical role in the structure and function of the sperm flagella. It is involved in the tethering of the inner dynein arms along the axoneme, maintaining the integrity of these structures. The presence of DNAH1 throughout the flagellum is crucial for the organization of the inner dynein arms and the central microtubule pair, which are essential for sperm motility (Ben2014Mutations). DNAH1 is expressed at significantly higher levels in the testis compared to other tissues, highlighting its specialized role in sperm motility (Ben2014Mutations).

The protein is active in the axoneme, the core structure of cilia and flagella, facilitating microtubule sliding and bending necessary for motility (Ben2014Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DNAH1 gene are associated with multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF), a condition that leads to male infertility. These mutations result in structural defects of the sperm flagella, such as absent, short, coiled, or bent tails, which impair sperm motility and cause asthenozoospermia (Ben2014Mutations). Specific mutations, including c.11788-1G>A, lead to the degradation of transcripts by nonsense-mediated decay, resulting in the absence of DNAH1 protein in sperm (Ben2014Mutations). The absence or disorganization of inner dynein arms due to these mutations causes severe structural defects in the axoneme, such as the absence of the central pair of microtubules and disorganized fibrous sheath (Ben2014Mutations).

DNAH1 mutations have also been linked to dysplasia of the sperm fibrous sheath (DFS) in the Han Chinese population, with specific mutations like the 52430998CCT>C deletion in exon 73 being significant contributors to MMAF (Sha2017DNAH1). While DNAH1 is expressed in other ciliated cells, infertility is the primary symptom observed, suggesting a critical role for DNAH1 in sperm function (Ben2014Mutations). Unlike primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), which affects both respiratory function and fertility, MMAF due to DNAH1 mutations is not associated with respiratory symptoms (Wang2016Homozygous).

## Interactions
DNAH1, a component of the axonemal dynein complex, is involved in several critical protein interactions essential for the function of motile cilia and flagella. It interacts with TTC29 and DNALI1, forming part of the axonemal inner dynein arms (IDAs) in mouse models (Dacheux2023Novel). DNAH1 also interacts with the novel axonemal protein ZMYND12, which is necessary for proper sperm flagellum structure and function. The absence of ZMYND12 leads to severe axonemal disorganization, affecting DNAH1 and other components like WDR66 and DNALI1 (Dacheux2023Novel). 

In the context of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), DNAH1 is confirmed as an axonemal component of respiratory cilia. Its presence is verified by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining, which shows DNAH1's localization along the full-length ciliary axoneme in healthy controls. However, DNAH1 is absent in individuals with CCDC39 and CCDC40 variants, which are essential for the correct assembly of the 96 nm repeats along the ciliary axoneme (Wilken2024Primary). These interactions highlight DNAH1's role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of ciliary and flagellar axonemes.
