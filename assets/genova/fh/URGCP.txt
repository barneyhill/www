# URGCP

## Overview
URGCP, or upregulator of cell proliferation, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of cell growth and proliferation. The protein encoded by URGCP is implicated in various cellular processes, particularly those related to cancer progression, by modulating key signaling pathways such as the NF-κB pathway. It functions as a regulatory protein that influences the expression of critical cell cycle regulators, including Cyclin D1 and Cyclin E1, thereby promoting cell cycle progression and proliferation. URGCP has been identified as a significant player in several cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer, osteosarcoma, and leukemia, where its expression levels correlate with tumor growth, metastasis, and patient prognosis. Due to its role in these processes, URGCP is considered a potential therapeutic target and prognostic marker in oncology (Liu2020URG4; Xing2015URG4URGCP; Dodurga2012Leukemogenesis).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
The URGCP gene, also known as the upregulator of cell proliferation, is implicated in various cancers due to its role in promoting cell growth and proliferation. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), URGCP is significantly upregulated, enhancing the angiogenic capacity of cancer cells through the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. This leads to increased expression of pro-angiogenic factors such as VEGFC, contributing to tumor progression and suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Xing2015URG4URGCP).

In gastric cancer, URGCP is associated with increased cell proliferation and poor prognosis. Alterations in its expression, such as intron retention, have been linked to overall survival, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Wei2021Profiles). URGCP is also overexpressed in osteosarcoma, where it promotes tumor growth and metastasis through the GSK3β/β-catenin/cyclin D1 signaling pathway, highlighting its role as a potential therapeutic target (Liu2020URG4).

In leukemia, particularly acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), URGCP expression is significantly increased, correlating with high-risk cases and poor remission rates. This suggests its involvement in leukemogenesis and potential as a target for treatment (Dodurga2012Leukemogenesis).

## Interactions
URGCP, also known as the upregulator of cell proliferation, is involved in various interactions that influence cell cycle regulation and proliferation. In glioma, URGCP interacts with the NF-κB/p65 transcription factor, which is crucial for regulating the expression of Cyclin D1 and Cyclin E1 through the NF-κB pathway. This interaction involves the phosphorylation of IκBα and the nuclear translocation of NF-κB/p65, leading to increased cell proliferation (Hong2017Downregulation). URGCP also downregulates miR-16 via the transcription factor c-myc, which binds to the E-box of the miR-16 promoter region, affecting the expression of Cyclin D1 and Cyclin E1 (Hong2017Downregulation).

In osteosarcoma, miR-708-5p targets URGCP, leading to decreased mRNA and protein levels of URGCP and NF-κB, thereby suppressing cell proliferation and invasion (Sui2019MicroRNA‑708‑5p). In gastric cancer, miR-671-5p directly targets URGCP, inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis by downregulating URGCP expression (Qiu2018miR‑671‑5p). These interactions highlight URGCP's role in modulating key signaling pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target in various cancers.
