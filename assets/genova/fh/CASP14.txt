# CASP14

## Overview
CASP14 is a gene that encodes the protein caspase 14, a member of the caspase family of cysteine proteases. Unlike other caspases, which are primarily involved in apoptosis, caspase 14 is unique in its role in skin physiology, particularly in the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes and the cornification process of the epidermis (Lippens2000Epidermal). This protein is crucial for the formation of the skin's protective barrier, contributing to skin hydration and defense against environmental stressors (Pistritto2002Expression). CASP14 is expressed in the suprabasal layers of the epidermis and is involved in the processing of filaggrin, a key protein for maintaining skin homeostasis (Pistritto2002Expression; Lippens2000Epidermal). The gene's expression and the protein's activity are regulated by various transcriptional mechanisms and post-translational modifications, which may influence its function in both normal and pathological conditions, including cancer and skin disorders (Chow2011Caspase14; Markiewicz2021Caspase14—From).

## Structure
Caspase-14 (CASP14) is a member of the caspase family, characterized by its unique structure and function. The primary structure of CASP14 includes a pro-domain, a large subunit, and a small subunit, typical of caspases (Chow2011Caspase14). Its secondary structure is composed of five α-helices and six β-sheets, with two hydrophobic segments forming parallel β-sheets that potentially create an interaction pocket (Chow2011Caspase14). 

The tertiary structure of CASP14 forms a homodimer in its active state, which is a common feature among caspases. This dimerization is crucial for its enzymatic activity. CASP14 is distinct from other caspases as it lacks a typical caspase activation domain and is not involved in apoptotic pathways (Lippens2000Epidermal). 

Post-translational modifications of CASP14 include phosphorylation, with a predicted phosphorylation site at threonine 201, likely mediated by protein kinase C (Chow2011Caspase14). This modification may influence its function and localization, particularly in pathological conditions such as lung adenocarcinomas, where a phosphorylated form of CASP14 is observed (Chow2011Caspase14). 

Overall, CASP14's structure and modifications contribute to its specialized role in skin differentiation and potential involvement in cancer biology.

## Function
Caspase-14 (CASP14) is a unique member of the caspase family, primarily involved in the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, which are the predominant cell type in the epidermis. Unlike other caspases, CASP14 is not involved in apoptosis but plays a crucial role in the cornification process of the epidermis, contributing to the formation of the skin's protective barrier (Lippens2000Epidermal). CASP14 is expressed in the differentiating suprabasal layers of the epidermis, including the spinous layers, stratum granulosum, and stratum corneum, but is absent in the basal layer (Lippens2000Epidermal).

In healthy human cells, CASP14 is involved in the processing of filaggrin, a protein essential for skin hydration and barrier function. This processing is vital for maintaining skin homeostasis and protecting against environmental stressors (Pistritto2002Expression). CASP14 is located in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of differentiating keratinocytes, indicating its active role in these cellular compartments (Pistritto2002Expression). Its expression is regulated by transcriptional mechanisms and is influenced by cell density and histone acetylation, rather than by cell cycle status or calcium-induced differentiation (Pistritto2002Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of CASP14 (caspase 14) have been linked to various diseases and conditions. In lung adenocarcinoma, increased expression of CASP14 is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to cisplatin treatment, suggesting its role in tumor growth and metastasis (Chow2011Caspase14; Markiewicz2021Caspase14—From). In gastric cancer, higher mRNA levels of CASP14 correlate with poor overall survival, particularly in the intestinal subtype (Wang2019Prognostic). 

In skin conditions, CASP14 is downregulated in psoriatic lesions, which are characterized by keratinocyte hyperproliferation and loss of the granular layer, indicating a potential link to abnormal keratinization processes (Lippens2000Epidermal). Its decreased expression is also noted in atopic dermatitis and eczema, correlating with impaired skin barrier integrity and disease severity (Markiewicz2021Caspase14—From). 

CASP14's role extends to diabetic retinopathy, where its upregulation in retinal cells is observed (Markiewicz2021Caspase14—From). In malignant melanoma, lower levels of CASP14 are associated with better treatment response, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Markiewicz2021Caspase14—From). These findings underscore the clinical significance of CASP14 in various pathological conditions.
