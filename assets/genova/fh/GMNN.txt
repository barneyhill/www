# GMNN

## Overview
Geminin (GMNN) is a gene that encodes the geminin DNA replication inhibitor, a nuclear protein that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of DNA replication and cell cycle progression in eukaryotic cells. As a regulatory protein, geminin functions primarily by inhibiting the DNA replication factor Cdt1, thereby preventing the re-replication of DNA and maintaining genomic stability (TSANIRAS2019DNA). This inhibition is crucial for ensuring that DNA replication occurs only once per cell cycle, thus safeguarding against genomic instability and potential oncogenesis. Beyond its role in DNA replication, geminin is involved in maintaining pluripotency in embryonic stem cells and regulating the balance between self-renewal and differentiation in neuronal progenitor cells (Tabrizi2013Geminin; TSANIRAS2019DNA). The protein's interactions with various transcription factors and chromatin remodeling complexes further underscore its multifaceted role in cellular homeostasis and development (Pitulescu2009TIPT2). Given its critical functions, alterations in GMNN expression are associated with various cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Blanchard2011Geminin).

## Structure
Geminin (GMNN) is a protein involved in the regulation of DNA replication. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains essential for its function. The secondary structure of Geminin includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stability and function. The tertiary structure of Geminin is characterized by a coiled-coil domain, which is crucial for its ability to form homodimers, representing its quaternary structure (Kushwaha2016Geminin).

Geminin interacts with the DNA replication factor Cdt1, forming complexes that regulate DNA replication licensing. It can form a heterotrimer with two Geminin proteins and one Cdt1 molecule, as well as a heterohexamer with four Geminin proteins and two Cdt1 molecules. These complexes play distinct roles in DNA replication, with the heterohexamer inhibiting DNA licensing and the heterotrimer promoting it (Kushwaha2016Geminin).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are crucial for Geminin's function, particularly during the S phase of the cell cycle. These modifications regulate its activity and interactions with other proteins involved in DNA replication and cell cycle progression (Kushwaha2016Geminin).

## Function
Geminin (GMNN) is a nuclear protein that plays a critical role in regulating DNA replication in eukaryotic cells. It functions by inhibiting the DNA replication factor Cdt1, thereby preventing the re-replication of DNA, which is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and preventing cancer development (TSANIRAS2019DNA). Geminin is expressed during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle and is degraded by the anaphase-promoting complex during the metaphase-anaphase transition (TSANIRAS2019DNA). 

In addition to its role in DNA replication, geminin is involved in maintaining pluripotency in embryonic stem cells by interacting with pluripotency factors such as Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog (Tabrizi2013Geminin; TSANIRAS2019DNA). It regulates the balance between self-renewal and differentiation in neuronal progenitor cells and is essential for the maintenance of pluripotency and early neural development (Tabrizi2013Geminin; Kushwaha2016Geminin). Geminin's activity is modulated by its nuclear localization and interaction with other proteins, and its function is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Kushwaha2016Geminin). The protein also plays a role in retinoic acid signaling pathways and interacts with chromatin remodeling proteins, influencing the epigenetic regulation of pluripotency genes (Tabrizi2013Geminin; TSANIRAS2019DNA).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GMNN gene, which encodes the geminin protein, are associated with various cancers, particularly breast cancer. Overexpression of geminin is linked to the development of aggressive breast tumors, including Her2+ and triple-negative/basal-like subtypes, and is associated with poor prognosis. This overexpression leads to cytokinesis failure, resulting in aneuploidy, a hallmark of aggressive cancers (Blanchard2011Geminin). Geminin overexpression also contributes to drug resistance, as it induces resistance to Aurora B kinase inhibitors and microtubule-targeting drugs (Blanchard2011Geminin).

In adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), high GMNN expression correlates with malignant progression and poor prognosis. It is associated with advanced disease stages and metastasis, serving as an independent prognostic factor (Zhao2022High). 

Targeting geminin expression or activity has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy. Depletion of geminin selectively induces DNA re-replication and apoptosis in malignant cancer cells, suggesting its potential as a target for cancer treatment (Zhu2009Selective). These findings highlight the clinical significance of GMNN in cancer pathophysiology and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
Geminin (GMNN) is a multifunctional protein that interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in DNA replication and cell cycle regulation. It forms a complex with Cdt1, a key player in the initiation of DNA replication, to regulate the loading of minichromosome maintenance helicases (MCM) onto the chromatin-bound origin recognition complex (ORC), thereby preventing the assembly of the pre-replication complex (Kushwaha2016Geminin). This interaction is dynamic, involving a conformational change between a GMNN-Cdt1 heterotrimer and heterohexamer complex, which is responsible for either licensing or inhibiting DNA replication (Kushwaha2016Geminin).

Geminin also interacts with various transcription factors and chromatin remodeling complexes. It binds to homeodomain proteins and members of the polycomb and SWI/SNF complexes, repressing Hox functions during embryogenesis and interacting with the homeobox protein Six3 (Pitulescu2009TIPT2). Geminin acts as a transcriptional co-activator, enhancing the activation of TATA-containing promoters through its interaction with TIPT2 and TBP (Pitulescu2009TIPT2). It also interacts with pluripotency factors such as Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog, maintaining pluripotency by antagonizing Brg1 and indirectly activating the Sox2 SRR2 enhancer (TSANIRAS2019DNA).
