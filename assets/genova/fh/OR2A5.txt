# OR2A5

## Overview
The OR2A5 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily A member 5, a protein that belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is integral to their function in olfactory signal transduction. The OR2A5 protein is primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it plays a pivotal role in the detection and discrimination of odorant molecules. This receptor is involved in the perception of smell, influencing dietary preferences and potentially contributing to evolutionary adaptations related to subsistence strategies. Genetic variations in OR2A5 have been linked to differences in food perception and feeding behavior, highlighting its significance in human evolution and adaptation (Veilleux2023Human).

## Structure
The OR2A5 gene encodes a protein that is part of the olfactory receptor family, which are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). These receptors typically exhibit a seven-transmembrane domain structure, a hallmark of GPCRs, allowing them to traverse the cell membrane multiple times. The primary structure of OR2A5 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, which is crucial for its function in olfactory signal transduction. The secondary structure likely includes alpha helices, which are common in the transmembrane regions of GPCRs, providing stability and facilitating the receptor's interaction with odorant molecules.

The tertiary structure of OR2A5 refers to its overall three-dimensional shape, which is essential for its function as it determines the receptor's ability to bind specific ligands. Although olfactory receptors generally function as monomers, the quaternary structure is not typically a focus for these proteins, as they do not usually form multimeric complexes.

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation may occur, influencing the receptor's localization and functional activity. These modifications can affect how the receptor is trafficked to the cell surface and its responsiveness to odorant molecules, although specific details for OR2A5 are not provided in the context (Ansoleaga2015Decrease; Veilleux2023Human).

## Function
The OR2A5 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules. These receptors are primarily active in the olfactory epithelium, where they bind specific odorants, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. The OR2A5 receptor is involved in food perception and feeding behavior, with genetic variations in this gene associated with dietary preferences such as fruit intake. This suggests that OR2A5 may have been subject to selection pressures related to different subsistence strategies, such as agriculture, where its increased frequency in certain populations like the BaKiga agriculturalists indicates adaptation to agricultural diets (Veilleux2023Human).

The OR2A5 gene is part of a haplotype block that is relatively ancient, with an estimated age of 727,000 years, indicating that its variations predate modern humans and may have evolved from standing variation rather than being directly linked to agriculture (Veilleux2023Human). These genetic variations may also play broader roles beyond food perception, potentially acting as nutrient or toxin detectors in various body systems (Veilleux2023Human).
