# SULT1C2

## Overview
SULT1C2 is a gene that encodes the protein sulfotransferase family 1C member 2, a member of the cytosolic sulfotransferase family. These enzymes are pivotal in the metabolism of a wide array of endogenous and exogenous compounds through the process of sulfation, which involves the transfer of a sulfonate group to substrates, thereby increasing their solubility and facilitating excretion. The SULT1C2 protein is characterized by a conserved structural fold typical of sulfotransferases, which includes a central beta-sheet flanked by alpha-helices. This structural configuration is crucial for its enzymatic activity, particularly in binding the cofactor 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS). SULT1C2 is expressed in various human tissues, including the stomach, kidney, and fetal liver, and plays a significant role in the metabolism of hormones, neurotransmitters, and xenobiotics. Its expression is developmentally regulated, suggesting a critical function in early human development and protection against toxic exposures (Dubaisi2019Developmental; Johnson2021The; AllaliHassani2007Structural).

## Structure
The SULT1C2 protein is a member of the human cytosolic sulfotransferases, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs, hormones, and xenobiotics. The crystal structure of SULT1C2 has been resolved, revealing a common structural fold shared among sulfotransferases. This fold is characterized by a central four-stranded parallel beta-sheet surrounded by alpha-helices and loops. In the absence of ligands, these loops can be disordered, but the presence of ligands such as PAP or PAPS induces ordering, particularly forming helices a4-a5 and a14-a15 (AllaliHassani2007Structural).

The binding site for PAP or PAPS is highly conserved across SULTs, with specific residues contributing to the binding pocket. The structural data suggest that PAPS binding primes certain loops for substrate binding, indicating a potential coupling between cofactor and substrate binding (AllaliHassani2007Structural). The SULT1C2 protein also features a PAPS binding domain, essential for its enzymatic activity. However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, as well as post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available excerpts (Hehonah1999Molecular; AllaliHassani2007Structural).

## Function
SULT1C2 is a member of the cytosolic sulfotransferase family, which plays a crucial role in the metabolism of various endogenous and exogenous compounds through the process of sulfation. This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a sulfonate group to substrates, enhancing their solubility and facilitating their excretion from the body. SULT1C2 is involved in the metabolism of hormones, neurotransmitters, and xenobiotics, including drugs and environmental toxins (Johnson2021The; AllaliHassani2007Structural).

In healthy human cells, SULT1C2 is expressed in several tissues, including the stomach, kidney, and fetal liver. Its expression is developmentally regulated, with high levels observed in prenatal and infant liver, suggesting a role in early human development (Dubaisi2019Developmental). The enzyme is involved in the metabolism of thyroid hormones, which are critical for regulating multiple metabolic pathways during development (Dubaisi2019Developmental).

SULT1C2's activity in the cytosol is essential for detoxifying potentially harmful compounds and modulating the activity of bioactive molecules. This function is particularly important in protecting developing individuals from toxic exposures and ensuring proper physiological development (Dubaisi2019Developmental).

## Clinical Significance
The SULT1C2 gene has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression levels and genetic polymorphisms. In the context of polycystic kidney disease (PKD), the expression of SULT1C2 is significantly decreased in the kidneys of rats with DPT-induced PKD. This down-regulation may contribute to cystic changes in the kidney by affecting the sulfation of tubular basement membrane components, potentially playing a critical role in the development of cysts (Sugimura2002Decreased).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), SULT1C2 expression is influenced by tobacco exposure and is associated with patient outcomes. The gene is epigenetically activated and transcriptionally induced by cigarette smoke, with its expression levels being higher in LUAD tumors compared to non-tumor lung tissue. This increased expression is linked to improved survival in smokers, suggesting a role in detoxification pathways (Johnson2021The). Additionally, genetic polymorphisms in SULT1C2, such as nonsynonymous cSNPs, can affect enzyme activity and substrate interaction, although specific diseases directly linked to these polymorphisms are not detailed (Kurogi2021SULT).

## Interactions
The SULT1C2 gene is involved in transcriptional regulation through interactions with nuclear receptors and response elements. In LS180 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells, the vitamin D receptor (VDR) binds to a vitamin D response element (VDRE) located near the 5'-end of the SULT1C2 gene. This interaction is crucial for the vitamin D3-mediated activation of SULT1C2, as deletion or mutation of this VDRE significantly reduces gene activation (Barrett2016Transcriptional). An ELISA-based assay confirmed the direct binding of VDR to this VDRE site, highlighting the specificity of this interaction (Barrett2016Transcriptional).

In the context of lung adenocarcinoma and tobacco exposure, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) has been identified as a key transcription factor that binds to the SULT1C2 promoter. This binding is enhanced in the presence of cigarette smoke components, suggesting a direct interaction between AHR and the SULT1C2 promoter. This interaction is more pronounced than AHR's binding to other known target sites, indicating a specific regulatory role in response to xenobiotic exposure (Johnson2021The). These interactions underscore the role of SULT1C2 in the regulation of detoxifying enzymes and its potential involvement in carcinogenic processes.
