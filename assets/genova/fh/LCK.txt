# LCK

## Overview
LCK is a gene that encodes the LCK proto-oncogene, a member of the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, which plays a pivotal role in T-cell signaling. The LCK protein is primarily expressed in T cells and is integral to the T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathway, where it phosphorylates immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) to initiate downstream signaling cascades. This kinase is crucial for T-cell development, activation, and proliferation, and it interacts with coreceptors such as CD4 and CD8 to facilitate its recruitment to the TCR complex. The activity of LCK is tightly regulated by phosphorylation at specific tyrosine residues, with proteins like CD45 and Csk modulating its activation state. Dysregulation of LCK, through mutations or overexpression, is associated with various immune disorders and malignancies, including severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and T-cell leukemias (Palacios2004Function; Zhang2023New).

## Structure
The LCK protein is a member of the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases and plays a crucial role in T-cell signaling. It has a typical structure found in this family, consisting of several domains: an N-terminal SH4 domain, a unique domain (UD), SH3, SH2, and a catalytic kinase domain (FernándezAguilar2023A; Prakaash2022Molecular). The SH4 domain is involved in membrane localization and undergoes post-translational modifications, including myristoylation at glycine 2 and palmitoylation at cysteines 3 and 5, which are essential for its membrane attachment and biological activity (FernándezAguilar2023A; Prakaash2022Molecular).

The SH2 and SH3 domains are regulatory domains that control LCK's activity. The SH2 domain contains a critical phosphosite, Y192, which is significant for LCK's regulation (Courtney2017A). The kinase domain is responsible for phosphorylating ITAMs and other substrates, playing a key role in TCR signaling (Lo2018Lck).

LCK can exist in different conformations: an unfolded (open) conformation and a folded (closed) conformation. The phosphorylation of tyrosine 505 (Y505) regulates these conformational changes, with phosphorylation generating an SH2-binding site that causes a folded conformation (FernándezAguilar2023A). The protein's structure and function are influenced by its interactions with membrane lipids, particularly PIP2 and PIP3, which form an anionic annulus around the protein (Prakaash2022Molecular).

## Function
LCK, a member of the Src family of tyrosine kinases, plays a crucial role in T-cell development and activation. It is primarily expressed in T cells and is essential for T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling. LCK is involved in the phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) within the TCR complex, which is a critical step for recruiting and activating the Syk-family kinase ZAP-70, thereby propagating the TCR signaling cascade (Palacios2004Function; Rossy2012How).

LCK is associated with the CD4 and CD8 coreceptors, which are important for its recruitment to the TCR complex upon antigen recognition. This interaction facilitates the phosphorylation of ITAMs and the subsequent activation of downstream signaling pathways, leading to T-cell activation and proliferation (Palacios2004Function; Xu1993A). LCK's activity is regulated by its phosphorylation status at specific tyrosine residues, with CD45 and Csk playing key roles in modulating its activation state (Palacios2004Function; Rossy2012How).

In addition to its kinase activity, LCK may also function as an adaptor molecule, facilitating interactions between various signaling proteins, which underscores its multifaceted role in T-cell activation (Xu1993A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and dysregulation of the LCK gene are implicated in various immune disorders and malignancies. In severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), defective expression of the p56lck protein, encoded by LCK, leads to significant immunodeficiency. Patients with SCID exhibit symptoms such as lymphopenia and hypogammaglobulinemia, with reduced T cell responsiveness due to mutations affecting LCK expression and function (Goldman1998Defective). 

LCK mutations also result in profound T-cell immune deficiencies, as seen in cases with novel biallelic missense variants. These mutations lead to absent LCK protein expression, impaired TCR signaling, and severe infections, highlighting the critical role of LCK in T-cell function (Lanz2023A).

In malignancies, LCK is overexpressed in T-cell leukemias, such as T-ALL, and is associated with the activation of oncogenic pathways like JAK/STAT and NF-κB, contributing to leukemic cell survival and proliferation (Zhang2023New). The KHDRBS1-LCK fusion protein in peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL-NOS) leads to chronic TCR signaling and lymphoma development, with dasatinib showing potential as a therapeutic intervention (Debackere2021Fusion).

## Interactions
LCK, a member of the Src family tyrosine kinases, is involved in various protein interactions crucial for T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling. It interacts with the coreceptors CD4 and CD8, which facilitates its recruitment to the TCR-MHC/peptide complex, leading to the phosphorylation of ITAMs within the CD3 and TCRz signaling chains (Palacios2004Function; Xu1993A). LCK also interacts with the phosphatase CD45, which dephosphorylates its C-terminal tail, promoting activation (Rossy2012How; Courtney2017A). 

The SH2 and SH3 domains of LCK mediate interactions with proteins such as Zap70, Cbl, and TSAd. Zap70 is recruited and activated by LCK, playing a role in downstream signaling (Rossy2012How). Cbl, a ubiquitin ligase, binds to LCK's SH3 domain, leading to LCK ubiquitination and degradation, thus negatively regulating its activity (Rao2002Negative). TSAd interacts with LCK through its SH3 domain, facilitating the phosphorylation and activation of ITK, another kinase involved in T-cell signaling (Andersen2019The). 

LCK's interactions are essential for maintaining the balance of active kinase in T cells, influencing T-cell activation and function (Courtney2017A).
