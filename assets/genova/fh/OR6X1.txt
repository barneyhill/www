# OR6X1

## Overview
The OR6X1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 6 subfamily X member 1, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This receptor is primarily involved in the detection of odorants, playing a significant role in the olfactory system by binding specific odorant molecules and initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. OR6X1 is expressed in olfactory sensory neurons within the olfactory epithelium and is also found in various non-olfactory tissues, where it participates in diverse physiological processes. The receptor's expression in non-olfactory tissues suggests its involvement in broader biological functions beyond odor detection, including roles in epidermal homeostasis and potential implications in clinical conditions such as preeclampsia and mild gestational hypothyroidism (Saraiva2019A; Uehara2021Non‐invasive; Hirata2023Exploring).

## Function
OR6X1 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein involved in the detection of odorants. This receptor is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. OR6X1 is expressed in the olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) within the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorant molecules such as β-ionone, isovaleric acid, and (-)-carvone. These molecules are considered key food odorants (KFOs) in humans, suggesting that OR6X1 is important for detecting ecologically relevant odors that may influence food choice and other ecological functions (Saraiva2019A).

In addition to its role in olfaction, OR6X1 is expressed ectopically in various non-olfactory tissues, including the skin. In these tissues, OR6X1 and other olfactory receptors are involved in diverse physiological processes, such as epidermal proliferation, migration, and regeneration. The downregulation of OR6X1 in sensitive skin suggests a potential role in maintaining epidermal homeostasis (Uehara2021Non‐invasive). The receptor's expression in non-olfactory tissues indicates its involvement in broader biological functions beyond odor detection.

## Clinical Significance
The olfactory receptor gene OR6X1 has been studied for its potential clinical significance in conditions such as preeclampsia and mild gestational hypothyroidism. Research indicates that the downregulation of OR6X1 is associated with an increased risk of developing preeclampsia, a pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure and potential damage to other organ systems (Hirata2023Exploring). The study suggests that low expression levels of OR6X1 may contribute to hypertension and endothelial dysfunction due to impaired calcium signaling, which are key features of preeclampsia (Hirata2023Exploring).

In the context of mild gestational hypothyroidism, OR6X1 expression is negatively correlated with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, indicating that alterations in its expression may reflect thyroid dysfunction during pregnancy (Hirata2023Exploring). The study also highlights the potential of OR6X1 as a biomarker for predicting preeclampsia, with its expression levels being modulated by levothyroxine treatment, which may help maintain levels similar to those in healthy pregnancies (Hirata2023Exploring). Despite these findings, the clinical significance of OR6X1 mutations or expression changes in other conditions remains less documented.
