# DCUN1D3

## Overview
DCUN1D3, also known as SCCRO3, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of cullin neddylation, a critical post-translational modification process. The protein, defective in cullin neddylation 1 domain containing 3, functions primarily as a tumor suppressor by modulating the activity of cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases, which are essential for various cellular processes including transcription, differentiation, and cell cycle progression (Huang2014SCCRO3). Unlike other proteins in the neddylation pathway, SCCRO3 does not possess E3 ligase activity but instead competes with oncogenic SCCRO (DCUN1D1) for cullin binding, thereby influencing their localization and activity (Huang2014SCCRO3). This regulatory role is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis. Additionally, DCUN1D3 is implicated in the regulation of oxidative stress responses through its interaction with the Cul3-Keap1-E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, highlighting its broader significance in cellular stress management and disease (Shah2023Mild).

## Structure


## Function
DCUN1D3, also known as SCCRO3, functions as a tumor suppressor by antagonizing the oncogenic activity of SCCRO (DCUN1D1) through its effects on cullin neddylation and nuclear translocation. It sequesters cullins to the cell membrane, preventing their nuclear translocation and subsequent neddylation, a regulatory mechanism for cullin-RING type ubiquitination E3 ligases involved in various cellular processes such as transcription, differentiation, and cell cycle progression (Huang2014SCCRO3). 

DCUN1D3 does not efficiently bind to Ubc12 or promote cullin neddylation, indicating it lacks E3 ligase activity. Instead, it competes with SCCRO for binding and localization of cullins, affecting neddylation activity (Huang2014SCCRO3). This competition is crucial for its tumor suppressor function, which requires membrane localization and binding to cullins, facilitated by an intact myristoyl sequence and PONY domain (Huang2014SCCRO3).

In healthy human cells, DCUN1D3 regulates the availability of Cul3, a component of the Cul3-Keap1-E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which is involved in the degradation of Nrf2, a transcription factor that activates antioxidant responses. By sequestering Cul3 to the plasma membrane, DCUN1D3 reduces Nrf2 degradation, facilitating its nuclear translocation and activation of antioxidant genes, crucial for managing oxidative stress (Shah2023Mild).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the DCUN1D3 gene, also known as SCCRO3, have been implicated in various cancers. DCUN1D3 is frequently downregulated in several human tumors, including lung squamous cell carcinomas, lung adenocarcinomas, lung neuroendocrine tumors, oral squamous cell carcinomas, ovarian carcinomas, and thyroid tumors, suggesting a potential tumor suppressor role (Huang2014SCCRO3). The decreased expression of DCUN1D3 in tumors is not attributed to recurrent chromosomal losses or mutations in its coding region but is thought to be regulated post-transcriptionally by the PUM2 protein, which binds to DCUN1D3 mRNA and reduces its stability (Huang2014SCCRO3).

DCUN1D3 also plays a role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through a gene fusion with GSG1L, which has been identified in multiple HCC samples. This fusion affects the protein structure and may contribute to HCC development (Zhu2016The). Additionally, reduced expression of DCUN1D3 due to sleep restriction has been linked to increased oxidative stress and impaired endothelial function, potentially elevating cardiovascular risk (Shah2023Mild). These findings highlight the clinical significance of DCUN1D3 in cancer and cardiovascular conditions.

## Interactions
The DCUN1D3 gene encodes the protein SCCRO3, which is involved in the neddylation process, particularly affecting F-Box ubiquitin ligases, also known as Cullin 1 ligases. SCCRO3 interacts with CRL1 ligases and the protein CAND1. This interaction is crucial as it blocks the nuclear translocation of E3 ligases, thereby influencing cell cycle progression, especially upon UV damage. The interaction of SCCRO3 with CRL1 ligases and CAND1 highlights its regulatory function in the neddylation pathway, which is essential for the proper functioning of E3 ligase complexes (Vriend2022Ubiquitin).
