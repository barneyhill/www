# AIF1

## Overview
Allograft inflammatory factor 1 (AIF1) is a gene located within the HLA class III region on chromosome 6, encoding a cytoplasmic, calcium-binding protein known for its involvement in immune and inflammatory responses. The AIF1 protein, characterized by an EF-hand motif, is primarily expressed in immune cells such as macrophages and microglial cells, as well as in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells. This protein plays a crucial role in modulating cellular processes, including cell proliferation, migration, and cytokine production, by influencing signaling pathways like Akt and MAPK. AIF1 is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including angiogenesis, wound healing, vascular inflammation, and atherosclerosis. Its expression and activity are regulated through post-translational modifications and interactions with other proteins, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular functions and disease pathogenesis (Tian2009AIF1; Zhao2013Role; Deininger2002The).

## Structure
The allograft inflammatory factor 1 (AIF-1) protein is a 17 kDa, interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) inducible, calcium-binding protein characterized by the presence of an EF-hand motif, which is crucial for its calcium-binding capability (Li2006Crystallization; Deininger2002The). This EF-hand motif is a common structural feature in proteins that bind calcium ions, contributing to the protein's role in various cellular processes, including immune responses and vascular smooth muscle cell growth (Deininger2002The).

AIF-1 is encoded within the HLA class III genomic region on chromosome 6 and is expressed in various tissues, including immune cells such as macrophages and microglial cells (Deininger2002The). The protein shares sequence identity with other proteins like Iba1 and MRF-1, indicating a conserved structure across species (Deininger2002The).

The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which could regulate its activity. AIF-1 can form homodimers, suggesting a quaternary structure, and has splice variant isoforms like IRT-1 and BART-1, which may include different structural motifs such as leucine zippers and hormone precursor sites, potentially diversifying its biological functions (Deininger2002The).

## Function
Allograft inflammatory factor 1 (AIF1) is a cytoplasmic, calcium-binding protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses. It is primarily expressed in macrophages, endothelial cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), where it modulates various cellular processes. In macrophages, AIF1 influences adhesion, shape, and cytokine production, particularly interleukins IL-6, IL-10, and IL-12p40, upon stimulation with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (Zhao2013Role). It also affects macrophage proliferation and migration by modulating signaling pathways such as Akt and MAPK (Zhao2013Role).

In endothelial cells, AIF1 is involved in cell proliferation, migration, and signal transduction, crucial for processes like angiogenesis and wound healing. It enhances the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, which are essential for endothelial cell responses to inflammatory and angiogenic stimuli (Tian2009AIF1). AIF1 also acts as a scaffold protein, facilitating the activation of kinases such as Akt and p44/42 MAPK, which are vital for macrophage activation and inflammatory responses (Tian2006Inhibition).

AIF1's role extends to the regulation of vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis, where it is expressed in response to oxidized low-density lipoprotein and contributes to macrophage activation and proliferation (Tian2006Inhibition).

## Clinical Significance
The AIF1 gene is clinically significant due to its involvement in various diseases through alterations in expression levels and interactions. In cancer, AIF1 is linked to the development and progression of several types, including hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, glioma, esophageal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, gallbladder cancer, and gastric cancer. Its expression correlates with tumor characteristics and resistance to treatments, suggesting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (De2023AIF1:).

In inflammatory diseases, AIF1 is implicated in chronic kidney disease, diabetic kidney disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. It influences vascular calcification and inflammation through pathways like NF-κB and p38 MAPK, affecting disease progression and treatment responses (De2023AIF1:). AIF1 is also associated with atherosclerosis, obesity, and type 1 diabetes, where it enhances macrophage activity and influences metabolic parameters, contributing to disease pathophysiology (De2023AIF1:).

In neurological disorders, AIF1 is upregulated in conditions like Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis, where it is linked to immune response regulation and CNS injury recovery (De2023AIF1:). These findings underscore AIF1's role in disease pathogenesis and its potential as a therapeutic target.
