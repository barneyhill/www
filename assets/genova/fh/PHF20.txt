# PHF20

## Overview
PHF20 is a gene that encodes the PHD finger protein 20, a transcriptional regulator involved in chromatin remodeling and gene expression. The protein is characterized by its complex domain architecture, including tandem Tudor domains, a C2H2-type zinc finger, an AT-hook, and a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger, which enable it to interact with various histone modifications and transcription factors. As a methyl lysine effector protein, PHD finger protein 20 plays a crucial role in linking histone modifications, such as the methylation of histone H3K4 and the acetylation of histone H4, to transcriptional regulation. It is a component of the MOF-NSL lysine acetyltransferase complex and interacts with key proteins like p53 and the NF-κB pathway, influencing processes such as DNA damage response, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis. The overexpression of PHF20 is associated with several cancers, including glioblastoma and lung cancer, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Zhang2013PHF20; Li2013PKBmediated; Klein2016PHF20).

## Structure
PHF20 (PHD finger protein 20) is characterized by a complex domain architecture that includes tandem Tudor domains, a C2H2-type zinc finger, an AT-hook, and a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger. The N-terminal Tudor domains, Tud1 and Tud2, exhibit a typical Tudor domain structure with antiparallel beta-sheets forming a barrel shape. Tud1 has an atypical aromatic cage due to a 3_10-helix that occludes the binding site, while Tud2 features a conserved aromatic cage and forms a dimer through intermolecular disulfide bonds (AdamsCioaba2012Crystal).

The PHD finger of PHF20 specifically recognizes dimethylated lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me2) and is involved in gene regulation and cancer cell growth. This domain has a canonical fold with a short double-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and two α-helical turns, and it binds H3K4me2 in a negatively charged channel (Klein2016PHF20). The PHD finger's binding affinity for H3K4me2 is crucial for its role in histone acetylation and transcriptional activation (Klein2016PHF20).

PHF20 also interacts with methylated p65 in the NF-kB pathway, with the Tudor2 domain playing a key role in this interaction, highlighting its involvement in transcriptional regulation and potential implications in cancer (Zhang2013PHF20).

## Function
PHF20 (PHD finger protein 20) is a transcriptional regulator involved in chromatin remodeling and gene expression in healthy human cells. It functions as a methyl lysine effector protein, linking histone modifications such as the methylation of histone H3K4 and the acetylation of histone H4K16, which are crucial for transcriptional regulation (Klein2016PHF20). PHF20 contains two methyllysine reader domains: the PHD finger and the tandem Tudor domains. The PHD finger domain specifically recognizes H3K4me2, facilitating PHF20-dependent histone acetylation and transcriptional activation (Klein2016PHF20).

PHF20 is a component of the MOF-NSL lysine acetyltransferase complex, playing a role in the acetylation of histone H4, which is important for gene expression regulation (Yang2017PHF20). It also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, potentially promoting its acetylation and stabilizing it at genomic sites enriched in H3K4me2 (Klein2016PHF20). This interaction suggests a role for PHF20 in p53-related pathways, including DNA damage response, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis (Klein2016PHF20).

In terms of cellular localization, PHF20 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences gene expression through its interactions with chromatin and transcription factors (Badeaux2012Loss).

## Clinical Significance
PHF20 (PHD finger protein 20) is implicated in various cancers due to its role in regulating key signaling pathways and transcription factors. Overexpression of PHF20 is associated with glioblastoma, lung cancer, colon cancer, and ovarian cancer, where it contributes to tumorigenesis by modulating p53-mediated signaling and NF-kB activation (Zhang2013PHF20; Li2013PKBmediated). In glioblastoma, PHF20 overexpression correlates with higher tumor grades and poor prognosis, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for glioma progression (Zhang2013PHF20; Ma2020PHF20).

PHF20's interaction with the NF-kB pathway is particularly significant, as it disrupts the recruitment of PP2A to p65, leading to sustained NF-kB activation, which is crucial in inflammation-linked cancer development (Zhang2013PHF20). Additionally, PHF20 is phosphorylated by PKB on Ser291, affecting p53 function and contributing to cancer cell survival (Li2013PKBmediated).

In hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, PHF20 is linked to cisplatin resistance, and its inhibition enhances chemosensitivity, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Liu2021PHF20). Overall, PHF20's role in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target highlight its clinical significance.

## Interactions
PHF20 (PHD finger protein 20) is involved in several critical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, influencing transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling. It is a component of the MOF-NSL lysine acetyltransferase complex, which acetylates histone H4 and non-histone proteins, playing a role in transcriptional regulation and DNA damage response (Klein2016PHF20). PHF20 interacts with the MLL1 complex, crucial for H3K4 methylation, and binds to dimethylated p53 at K370 or K382 through its Tudor2 domain, enhancing p53 stability and activity by preventing its ubiquitination (Klein2016PHF20).

PHF20 also plays a significant role in NF-κB signaling by interacting with the p65 subunit. It disrupts the recruitment of the phosphatase PP2A to p65, leading to persistent phosphorylation and enhanced NF-κB activation. This interaction is methylation-dependent, specifically involving lysine residues K218 and K221 on p65, and is mediated by the Tudor2 domain of PHF20 (Zhang2013PHF20). PHF20's overexpression correlates with increased NF-κB activity and is associated with tumorigenicity in gliomas (Zhang2013PHF20). These interactions highlight PHF20's role as a transcriptional activator and its involvement in maintaining constitutive NF-κB activation in cancer (Zhang2013PHF20).
