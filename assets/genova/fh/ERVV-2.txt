# ERVV-2

## Overview
ERVV-2 is a gene that encodes the endogenous retrovirus group V member 2, envelope protein, known as EnvP(b)1. This protein is a transmembrane protein characterized by its gamma-type envelope structure, which includes distinct surface and transmembrane domains. EnvP(b)1 is involved in mediating cell-cell fusion, a process crucial for the formation of multinucleated syncytia, particularly in the placenta (McCarthy2020Structure). The gene is part of the endogenous retrovirus group V and has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including hereditary breast cancer, where alterations in its expression have been observed (Hu2018Clinical; Kuusisto2013Copy). Despite its low expression in most tumors, some renal tumors exhibit high levels of ERVV-2 expression, suggesting a potential role in carcinogenesis that warrants further investigation (Kasperek2021Therapeutic).

## Structure
The ERVV-2 gene encodes the EnvP(b)1 protein, an endogenous retroviral envelope protein expressed in human tissues. The primary structure of EnvP(b)1 includes an intact open reading frame (ORF) located within the RIN3 gene locus, evolving under purifying selection (McCarthy2020Structure). The protein is characterized by a gamma-type envelope with distinct surface (SU) and transmembrane (TM) domains, featuring a furin cleavage site and a CXXC/CX6CC disulfide bond motif (McCarthy2020Structure).

The secondary structure of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of EnvP(b)1 is composed of a β sandwich core, resembling a V-type immunoglobulin fold, with extensions forming loops and α-helical regions (McCarthy2020Structure). The tertiary structure is compact compared to other gammaretroviruses, with a conserved architecture that includes a central helix and an 8-amino-acid loop, which serves as a platform for receptor binding specificity (McCarthy2020Structure).

EnvP(b)1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including proteolytic processing, which is essential for its fusogenic activity, allowing it to mediate cell-cell fusion and form multinucleated syncytia (McCarthy2020Structure). The protein is expressed in a fusion-competent form in various human tissues, notably the placenta (McCarthy2020Structure).

## Clinical Significance
The ERVV-2 gene, part of the endogenous retrovirus group V, has been implicated in various clinical conditions, particularly in the context of cancer. Alterations in the expression of ERVV-2 have been observed in hereditary breast cancer populations that are negative for BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations. Specifically, exonic duplication of ERVV-2 has been identified as a variant in these populations, suggesting a potential role in breast cancer susceptibility (Hu2018Clinical). In familial BRCA1/2-negative Finnish breast and ovarian cancer cases, a duplication affecting the coding region of ERVV-2 was more commonly homozygous in affected individuals compared to controls, indicating its possible involvement in cancer predisposition (Kuusisto2013Copy).

In tumor conditions, ERVV-2 expression is generally low, but some renal tumors have shown high levels of expression, warranting further investigation to confirm its presence at the protein level (Kasperek2021Therapeutic). These findings suggest that ERVV-2 may play a role in carcinogenesis, although its exact mechanisms and broader implications in cancer and other diseases require further research. The gene's involvement in other conditions beyond cancer has not been extensively detailed in the available literature.
