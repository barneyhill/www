# SDHB

## Overview
The SDHB gene encodes the succinate dehydrogenase complex iron sulfur subunit B, a vital component of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex, also known as mitochondrial complex II. This protein is categorized as an iron-sulfur protein and plays a crucial role in cellular energy metabolism by participating in both the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the electron transport chain. The SDHB protein contains iron-sulfur clusters essential for electron transfer, facilitating the conversion of succinate to fumarate and the subsequent transfer of electrons to ubiquinone, which is reduced to ubiquinol (Yankovskaya2003Architecture; Kim2015Structural). Mutations in the SDHB gene can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and are associated with various hereditary conditions, including paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma syndromes and other tumorigenic processes (Bénit2022Succinate; Brouwers2006High).

## Structure
The SDHB gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex, also known as mitochondrial complex II. The SDHB protein is an iron-sulfur protein that contains three iron-sulfur clusters, which are essential for electron transfer within the complex (Dona2021MITOCHONDRIA:; Huang2021Crystallographic). Structurally, SDHB is described as having a butterfly shape and is organized into two domains (Gong2020CryoEM). 

The SDHB subunit is small and sandwiched between other subunits, with a significant portion of its surface area forming interfaces with these subunits, indicating its structural fragility (Gruber2023Succinate). This structural arrangement makes SDHB more susceptible to deleterious effects from missense variants compared to other SDH subunits (Gruber2023Succinate). 

In terms of quaternary structure, SDHB interacts with other subunits of the SDH complex, including SDHA, SDHC, and SDHD, to form a functional enzyme complex (Dona2021MITOCHONDRIA:). The SDHB subunit contributes to the ubiquinone binding site, with specific residues such as Ile218 and Pro169 playing roles in inhibitor binding and electron transfer (Huang2021Crystallographic). 

Mutations in SDHB can lead to structural changes that affect the enzyme's function and stability, contributing to various disease phenotypes (Dona2021MITOCHONDRIA:).

## Function
The SDHB gene encodes the succinate dehydrogenase subunit B, a crucial component of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex, also known as complex II of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This complex plays a dual role in cellular metabolism, participating in both the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the electron transport chain. In the TCA cycle, SDHB is involved in the oxidation of succinate to fumarate, a key step in cellular respiration that contributes to the production of ATP, the primary energy currency of the cell (Brière2005Succinate; Kim2015Structural).

SDHB is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and contains iron-sulfur clusters that are essential for electron transfer within the SDH complex. These clusters facilitate the transfer of electrons from succinate to ubiquinone, which is then reduced to ubiquinol, a critical step in the electron transport chain that ultimately leads to ATP synthesis (Yankovskaya2003Architecture; Kim2015Structural).

The proper function of SDHB is vital for maintaining cellular energy metabolism and homeostasis. Mutations in the SDHB gene can disrupt these processes, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and contributing to the development of various tumors (Bénit2022Succinate; Kim2015Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SDHB gene are associated with several hereditary conditions, primarily paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma syndromes. These syndromes are characterized by the development of tumors in the nervous system, including paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas. SDHB mutations are linked to a higher risk of malignancy, particularly in extraadrenal paragangliomas, with a significant proportion of patients exhibiting metastatic disease (Neumann2004Distinct; Brouwers2006High). Approximately 30% to 41% of patients with malignant catecholamine-producing paragangliomas have SDHB mutations (Brouwers2006High).

SDHB mutations are also associated with other conditions, such as renal cell carcinoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) (Pasini2007Clinical; Benn201515). In Carney-Stratakis syndrome, SDHB mutations can lead to the development of paragangliomas and gastric stromal sarcomas (Pasini2007Clinical). Bi-allelic mutations in SDHB can result in complex II deficiency, leading to progressive neurological conditions like leukoencephalopathy (Grønborg2016Leukoencephalopathy).

Alterations in SDHB expression or function can disrupt cellular energy metabolism, contributing to tumorigenesis. This disruption is linked to a metabolic shift known as the Warburg effect, which is characterized by increased glucose uptake and glycolysis in tumors with SDHB mutations (Kamai2022Increased).

## Interactions
SDHB, a subunit of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its function. It interacts with LASS5 (also known as CERS5), a protein involved in ceramide synthesis. This interaction was identified through yeast two-hybrid and mammalian cell two-hybrid assays, and confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays. The interaction between LASS5 and SDHB is significant as it synergistically represses the activity of p53 and p21, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation and tumor biology (Jiang2016LASS5).

SDHB also interacts with the cochaperone HSC20, which is essential for the delivery of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters necessary for SDHB maturation and the assembly of complex II. This interaction involves specific LYR motifs in SDHB, which are crucial for Fe-S cluster incorporation. Mutations in these motifs can impair the binding to HSC20 and affect the formation of the mature SDH complex (Maio2014Cochaperone).

Additionally, SDHB interacts with TRAP1, a mitochondrial Hsp90 chaperone, which assists in its folding and maturation. This interaction accelerates TRAP1 dimer closure and ATP hydrolysis, highlighting a strong interaction that stabilizes SDHB folding intermediates (Liu2020CryoEM).
