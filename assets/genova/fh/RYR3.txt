# RYR3

## Overview
RYR3 is a gene that encodes the ryanodine receptor 3, a transmembrane calcium channel protein that is part of the ryanodine receptor family. This family also includes RYR1 and RYR2, which are involved in calcium signaling pathways critical for various physiological processes. The RYR3 protein is primarily located in the endoplasmic and sarcoplasmic reticulum, where it facilitates the release of calcium ions into the cytoplasm, influencing muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, and gene expression (Sorrentino1993Ryanodine). Structurally, RYR3 is a large homotetrameric channel characterized by several domains, including the N-terminal domain and transmembrane domain, which are involved in ligand binding and channel gating (Chen2024CryoEM). Functionally, RYR3 plays a role in skeletal muscle and brain tissues, contributing to muscle contraction and synaptic plasticity, respectively (Balschun1999Deletion; Bertocchini1997Requirement). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its association with various diseases, including breast cancer, developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, and conditions like hypertension and Alzheimer's disease, through its impact on calcium signaling pathways (Zhang2011Functional; Gong2018Polymorphisms; Li2024New).

## Structure
The RYR3 protein is a large homotetrameric calcium channel, part of the ryanodine receptor family, which includes RYR1 and RYR2. It is characterized by a complex structure comprising several domains, including the N-terminal domain (NTD), central domain, and transmembrane domain. The NTD is composed of NTD-A and NTD-B domains, along with the N-terminal solenoid (Nsol), and is involved in ligand binding, such as ATP and chloride ions, which contribute to the structural rigidity and potentially affect channel gating (Chen2024CryoEM).

The pore-forming domain of RYR3 consists of S5 and S6 helices from four subunits, which undergo conformational changes during channel opening. In the closed state, the pore is blocked by Ile4759, while in the open state, the narrowest points are formed by Gly4716 and Gln4755, allowing ion conduction (Chen2024CryoEM). The Bsol domain in RYR3 is more resolved compared to RyR2, lacking a 12-residue insertion present in RyR2 (Chen2024CryoEM).

RYR3 exhibits lower affinity for the auxiliary proteins FKBP12 and FKBP12.6, which stabilize the closed state of other ryanodine receptor isoforms, due to specific amino acid substitutions (Chen2024CryoEM). The protein's structure is further influenced by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its function. Splice variants of RYR3 may exist, leading to different isoforms with potentially distinct functional properties (Sorrentino1993Ryanodine).

## Function
RYR3 (ryanodine receptor 3) is a calcium channel protein that plays a significant role in calcium signaling within cells. It is primarily located in the endoplasmic and sarcoplasmic reticulum, where it mediates the release of calcium ions into the cytoplasm. This release is crucial for various cellular processes, including muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, and gene expression (Sorrentino1993Ryanodine).

In skeletal muscle, RYR3 is involved in the assembly of calcium release units (CRUs), although it is not essential for their initial formation. RyR3 can form ordered arrays independently of RyR1, but it does not induce specific arrangements of dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs), which are crucial for excitation-contraction coupling (Protasi2000RYR1). In neonatal muscles, RYR3 contributes to efficient muscle contraction by optimizing calcium release, although its expression decreases in adult muscles (Bertocchini1997Requirement).

In the brain, RYR3 is expressed in regions such as the hippocampus and cerebellum, where it is involved in calcium signaling related to synaptic plasticity and learning processes. It plays a role in maintaining synaptic strength and plasticity, which are essential for learning and memory (Balschun1999Deletion; Martin1998Partial).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RYR3 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In breast cancer, the SNP rs1044129 A→G within the miR-367 binding site in the 3′UTR of RYR3 is associated with increased cancer risk and calcification, particularly in postmenopausal women. This SNP affects the binding affinity of miR-367, leading to altered RYR3 expression, which is linked to poor progression-free survival in breast cancer patients (Zhang2011Functional).

RYR3 variants have also been associated with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE). A novel heterozygous variant in RYR3 was identified in a patient with West syndrome, suggesting that RYR3 mutations may lead to 'leaky' calcium release channels, contributing to DEE (Li2024New).

In the context of gender dysphoria, rare mutations in RYR3 have been found in individuals with the condition, potentially disrupting calcium homeostasis and affecting neuronal function (Yang2017Genomic).

Additionally, polymorphisms in RYR3 are linked to the risk and age of onset of hypertension, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease, suggesting a role in these conditions through shared genetic susceptibility and calcium signaling pathways (Gong2018Polymorphisms).

## Interactions
RYR3, or ryanodine receptor 3, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function as a calcium channel. It interacts with FKBP12 and FKBP12.6, which are immunophilin proteins that stabilize the closed state of ryanodine receptors. These interactions are crucial for preventing spontaneous calcium release events, known as Ca2+ sparks, thereby maintaining proper calcium signaling (Vervliet2015Bcl2). Despite having a lower affinity for FKBP12 and FKBP12.6 compared to other ryanodine receptor isoforms, RyR3 can still associate with these proteins, which is significant for its regulation (Chen2024CryoEM).

Bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic protein, also interacts with RyR3. It binds to a site that overlaps with the FKBP12-binding site, modulating calcium flux through the channel and contributing to its anti-apoptotic function (Vervliet2015Bcl2). This interaction suggests a complex regulatory mechanism where Bcl-2 may influence RyR3 function similarly to its effect on inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) (Vervliet2015Bcl2).

These interactions highlight the role of RyR3 in calcium signaling and its regulation by various proteins, which can impact physiological processes and potentially contribute to disease states.
