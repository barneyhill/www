# PBX4

## Overview
PBX4 is a gene that encodes the PBX homeobox 4 protein, a member of the TALE (three-amino-acid loop extension) family of homeodomain transcription factors. This protein is characterized by its DNA-binding homeodomain and its ability to form complexes with other transcription factors, such as HOX and MEIS, to regulate gene expression during vertebrate development (Longobardi2013Biochemistry; Laurent2008PBX). PBX4 plays a crucial role in morphogenetic processes and organogenesis, influencing body plan architecture and positional information along the anterior-posterior axis (Selleri2019‘Building). Although primarily expressed in the testes, PBX4 shares significant sequence identity with other PBX proteins, suggesting a conserved function in DNA binding and protein interactions (Selleri2019‘Building). Dysregulation of PBX4 has been implicated in various cancers, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for cancer prognosis and therapy (Song2022Identifying).

## Structure
PBX4 is a member of the TALE (three amino acids loop extension) family of homeodomain transcription factors, characterized by a conserved 60-residue-long helix-loop-helix homeodomain with a three-amino-acid extension (Longobardi2013Biochemistry). The primary structure of PBX4 includes a DNA-binding homeodomain and protein-protein interaction domains, such as the PBC-A and PBC-B domains, which are involved in interactions with other proteins (Longobardi2013Biochemistry). PBX4 is shorter than other PBX family members, missing the first 78 residues, including part of the PBC-A domain, and a 30-residue stretch in the C-terminal domain, yet it retains functional domains necessary for protein interactions (Longobardi2013Biochemistry).

The PBC-A domain in PBX4 is functional and allows for the restriction of the MEIS/PREP binding region to 51 residues, while the PBC-B domain conserves serine residues involved in the regulation of nuclear export (Longobardi2013Biochemistry). PBX4 forms dimers and higher-order complexes with other proteins, such as HOX, which is crucial for its function in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation (Longobardi2013Biochemistry). The protein's structure and interactions are essential for its role in developmental processes, including CNS patterning and myocardial differentiation (Kao2015Pbx4; Wang2009Molecular).

## Function
PBX4 (PBX homeobox 4) is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in regulating gene expression during vertebrate development. It is part of the TALE (three-amino-acid loop extension) family of homeodomain proteins, which are crucial for cellular differentiation and development. PBX4 interacts with other proteins, such as MEIS and HOX, to form transcriptional complexes that modulate gene expression by enhancing DNA-binding activity and selectivity (Longobardi2013Biochemistry; Laurent2008PBX).

PBX4 is involved in the regulation of morphogenetic processes and organogenesis, acting as a cofactor with HOX proteins to influence body plan architecture and positional information along the anterior-posterior axis (Selleri2019‘Building). Although PBX4 is expressed mainly in the testes, it shares extensive sequence identity with other PBX proteins in their DNA-binding homeodomains, suggesting a conserved role in DNA binding and protein-protein interactions (Longobardi2013Biochemistry; Selleri2019‘Building).

In healthy human cells, PBX4's specific functions are not fully detailed, but its involvement in transcriptional regulation and interaction with other transcription factors indicates its importance in developmental gene regulation and cellular differentiation (Laurent2008PBX).

## Clinical Significance
PBX4, a member of the pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox (PBX) transcription factors family, has been implicated in various cancers due to its dysregulation. Alterations in PBX4 expression are associated with several types of cancer, including testis, thyroid, colorectal, urothelial, stomach, pancreatic, cervical, endometrial, and ovarian cancers, where it is often overexpressed. Conversely, it is underexpressed in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (Rosales-Aviña2011MEIS1; Song2022Identifying). In ALL, PBX4 down-regulation is linked to the disease's progression and may contribute to chemotherapy resistance (Rosales-Aviña2011MEIS1).

PBX4 expression levels are significantly correlated with clinical outcomes in various cancers. For instance, overexpression of PBX4 is associated with poor prognosis in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) but correlates with better outcomes in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) (Song2022Identifying). PBX4's genetic alterations, such as copy number variations, are linked to decreased disease-free survival and progression-free survival in multiple cancer types (Song2022Identifying). Additionally, PBX4 methylation patterns are associated with survival prognosis and immune response modulation, affecting T-cell phenotypes (Song2022Identifying). These findings suggest that PBX4 could serve as a biomarker for cancer detection, prognosis, and immunotherapy (Song2022Identifying).
