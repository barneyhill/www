# FXYD6

## Overview
The FXYD6 gene encodes the protein FXYD domain containing ion transport regulator 6, also known as phosphohippolin, which is a member of the FXYD family of transmembrane proteins. These proteins are known for their role in modulating the activity of Na+/K+-ATPase, an enzyme essential for maintaining the electrochemical gradients of sodium and potassium ions across the plasma membrane (CHEN2013FXYD6). FXYD6 is predominantly expressed in the brain, where it contributes to neuronal excitability and development, playing a significant role in neural tissue function (CHEN2013FXYD6). The protein's interactions with Na+-K+-ATPase and H+-K+-ATPase suggest its involvement in regulating ion transport and cellular homeostasis (Pirkmajer2019Hormonal). Variants of the FXYD6 gene have been implicated in neurological and psychiatric disorders, including childhood-onset schizophrenia, highlighting its clinical significance (Chaumette2018Missense).

## Function
The FXYD6 gene encodes a protein that is a member of the FXYD domain-containing ion transport regulator family, which modulates the activity of Na+/K+-ATPase, an enzyme critical for maintaining the electrochemical gradients of sodium and potassium ions across the plasma membrane. This regulation is essential for various cellular processes, including maintaining cell volume, nerve impulse transmission, and muscle contraction (CHEN2013FXYD6). FXYD6 is highly expressed in the brain, where it plays a crucial role in the excitability and development of neurons, contributing to neural tissue function (CHEN2013FXYD6).

In healthy human cells, FXYD6 is expressed in the cytoplasm of normal biliary mucosa epithelial cells and is also present in neuronal cells, but not in glial cells (CHEN2013FXYD6). The protein's activity in the plasma membrane influences ion homeostasis and membrane potential, which are vital for proper neuronal function and development (CHEN2013FXYD6). Despite its known roles, there are no systematic studies on FXYD6 at the protein level in healthy cells, leaving some aspects of its function in normal physiology not fully understood (CHEN2013FXYD6).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the FXYD6 gene have been associated with several neurological and psychiatric disorders. Notably, missense variants in FXYD6 have been linked to childhood-onset schizophrenia (COS), a severe form of schizophrenia with onset before age 13. These variants are considered possibly damaging and have been identified in both American and French cohorts. FXYD6 encodes phosphohippolin, which is crucial for neuronal excitability, and its expression in the prefrontal cortex aligns with the early onset of COS. The study suggests that mutations in FXYD6 may lead to psychiatric symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations, which are associated with severe behavioral changes (Chaumette2018Missense).

In addition to its role in COS, FXYD6 has been identified as a significant hub protein in osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer. It was highlighted in a meta-analysis of differentially expressed genes, indicating its potential involvement in the molecular mechanisms of this disease (Yang2014Metaanalysis). Furthermore, FXYD6 is down-regulated in Wilms tumor, a childhood kidney cancer, suggesting its potential role in tumor progression and as a prognostic marker (Vastrad2020Hub).

## Interactions
FXYD6, also known as phosphohippolin, is a member of the FXYD family of proteins that modulate the activity of Na+-K+-ATPase, a crucial enzyme for maintaining ion gradients across the plasma membrane. In Xenopus oocytes, FXYD6 has been shown to associate with the α1/β1 and α1/β2 subunits of Na+-K+-ATPase, leading to a decrease in its activity (Pirkmajer2019Hormonal). This interaction suggests a regulatory role for FXYD6 in modulating ion transport and cellular homeostasis.

FXYD6 also interacts with H+-K+-ATPase in Xenopus oocytes, although the physiological significance of this interaction remains uncertain (Pirkmajer2019Hormonal). The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, where it may play a role in neuronal excitability and development (Chakraborti2015Na+K+ATPase:). Despite these known interactions, specific details about FXYD6's interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not well-documented in the available literature. The focus remains on its role in regulating Na+-K+-ATPase activity and its potential implications in higher brain functions, as variants of FXYD6 have been linked to conditions such as schizophrenia (Pirkmajer2019Hormonal).
