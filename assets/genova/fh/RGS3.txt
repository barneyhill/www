# RGS3

## Overview
RGS3 (Regulator of G protein Signaling 3) is a gene that encodes a regulatory protein involved in the modulation of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways. The protein, also named RGS3, functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Gα subunits, facilitating the inactivation of G proteins and thus playing a crucial role in the termination of signaling events (Berman1998Mammalian; De2000The). RGS3 is categorized as a member of the RGS protein family, characterized by a conserved RGS domain that is essential for its GAP activity (Zheng1999Divergence). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell migration and proliferation, and is expressed in multiple tissues, with significant roles in the kidney and other organs (Grüning1999Modulation). RGS3's interactions with other proteins, such as 14-3-3, and its involvement in signaling pathways, underscore its importance in cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in disease states, including cancer (Yang2023Function; NIU2002RGS3).

## Structure
RGS3 (Regulator of G protein Signaling 3) is a protein characterized by its RGS domain, which functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Gα subunits, facilitating the inactivation of G proteins (De2000The; Zheng1999Divergence). The RGS domain is conserved across the RGS protein family and is composed of nine alpha helices, similar to other RGS proteins like RGS4 (De2000The).

RGS3 is part of subfamily B of the RGS proteins, which includes members with short amino- and carboxy-terminal domains flanking the RGS domain (Chidiac2003Activity). However, RGS3 is unique due to its lengthy amino-terminal domain, which is approximately 380 residues long and plays a critical role in its subcellular localization (ToroCastillo2007Muscarinic). This domain contains a binding site for 14-3-3 proteins, specifically at Ser264, which influences its interaction with G proteins (NIU2002RGS3).

RGS3 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in variants such as RGS3T, which share similar functional properties in modulating calcium channels (ToroCastillo2007Muscarinic). The protein is also subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which can affect its interactions and regulatory functions (NIU2002RGS3).

## Function
RGS3 (Regulator of G protein Signaling 3) is a protein that plays a critical role in modulating G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways. It functions primarily as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP), accelerating the intrinsic GTPase activity of Gα subunits, which leads to the inactivation of G proteins and termination of signaling events (Berman1998Mammalian; Grüning1999Modulation). This regulatory mechanism is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and ensuring precise control over signal transduction processes.

In healthy human cells, RGS3 is involved in various cellular processes, including the modulation of cell migration and proliferation. It has been shown to significantly reduce lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)-mediated cell migration in renal tubular cells, indicating its role in regulating cell movement and response to growth factors during renal development (Grüning1999Modulation). RGS3 is expressed in several organs, with particularly high expression in the kidney, where it modulates tubular functions (Grüning1999Modulation).

RGS3 is active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences various signaling cascades, including those mediated by Gqα and Gsα subunits, affecting processes such as cyclic AMP accumulation and inositol phosphate production (Berman1998Mammalian; Grüning1999Modulation). Understanding the regulation and function of RGS3 is essential for elucidating its role in cellular signaling and potential implications in disease states.

## Clinical Significance
RGS3 is implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In non-small cell lung cancer, RGS3 is upregulated and negatively correlated with miR-25, influencing apoptotic cell death and cancer cell stemness (Yang2023Function). In hepatocellular carcinoma, RGS3 is associated with increased cell proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis, with a positive correlation to miR-145-5p (Yang2023Function). In gastric cancer, RGS3 expression is higher in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues and is negatively correlated with microRNA-133a, affecting cell proliferation (Li2023RGS; Yang2023Function).

In ovarian cancer, RGS3 expression is significantly higher in cancerous tissues and is part of a five-gene signature used to predict poor prognosis, associated with high mortality and advanced-stage cancer (Hu2021Identification). The gene is also involved in pathways such as Wnt signaling, which are linked to cancer cell proliferation and invasion (Hu2021Identification). These findings suggest that RGS3 plays a significant role in cancer progression and could be a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
RGS3 interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, specifically 14-3-3ε and 14-3-3τ, through its N-terminal region, distinct from its RGS domain. This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro pull-down experiments. The binding site for 14-3-3 on RGS3 is located at Ser264, a site distant from the RGS domain. This interaction affects RGS3's ability to bind G-proteins, reducing its regulatory function in G-protein signaling. A mutant form of RGS3 (S264A), which cannot bind 14-3-3, shows enhanced G-protein binding and regulatory activity, suggesting that 14-3-3 binding limits the available pool of RGS3 for G-protein interaction (NIU2002RGS3).

RGS3 also participates in interactions with Gα subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins, particularly Gαq, through its RGS domain. This interaction is crucial for its role in inhibiting G-protein signaling by accelerating the GTPase activity of Gα subunits, thereby inactivating them (NIU2002RGS3).

Additionally, RGS3 is involved in modulating adenylyl cyclase activity, which is influenced by G protein α subunits Gαs and Gαi. RGS3 can inhibit Gαs-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activation, potentially through direct interactions with Gαs or adenylyl cyclase (AbramowNewerly2006RGS).
