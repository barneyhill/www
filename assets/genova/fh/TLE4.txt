# TLE4

## Overview
TLE4 is a gene that encodes the protein TLE family member 4, a transcriptional corepressor belonging to the Groucho/TLE family. This protein is characterized by its role in modulating gene expression through interactions with DNA-bound transcription factors, despite not directly binding to DNA itself (Chen2000GrouchoTLE). TLE4 is involved in various developmental processes, including neurogenesis and hematopoiesis, by influencing cell differentiation and development (Wang2015TLE4). The protein's structure includes several conserved domains, such as the WD domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions crucial for its function in transcriptional repression (Jennings2008The). TLE4's activity is significant in the nucleus, where it recruits histone deacetylases to alter chromatin structure, thereby maintaining transcriptional silence of specific genes (Chen2000GrouchoTLE). The gene's dysregulation is implicated in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia, highlighting its importance in both normal cellular processes and disease states (Dayyani2008Loss).

## Structure
TLE4, a member of the Groucho/TLE family of transcriptional corepressors, is characterized by several conserved domains that contribute to its structure and function. The primary structure of TLE4 includes a glutamine-rich Q domain, a GP domain, a CcN domain, an SP domain, and a WD domain. The Q domain is essential for oligomerization and binding to transcription factors, facilitating the formation of a tetrameric structure (Jennings2008The; Chodaparambil2014Molecular). The WD domain, forming a seven-bladed β-propeller, is crucial for protein-protein interactions and binds to transcriptional repressor motifs such as WRPW and eh1 (Jennings2008The; Jennings2006Molecular).

The tertiary structure of TLE4 is defined by the β-propeller configuration of the WD domain, which is highly conserved across species and shares significant sequence identity with the yeast TUP1 co-repressor protein (Jennings2008The). This domain is involved in interactions with various transcription factors, playing a role in chromatin structure modification at target genes (Jennings2008The).

TLE4 may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its interactions and functional roles in cellular processes (Chodaparambil2014Molecular). The protein also has multiple splice variant isoforms, which may contribute to its diverse functional roles in different cellular contexts.

## Function
TLE4, a member of the Groucho/TLE family of transcriptional corepressors, plays a significant role in regulating gene expression in healthy human cells. It functions by interacting with DNA-bound transcription factors, modulating transcriptional activity without directly binding to DNA itself (Chen2000GrouchoTLE). TLE4 is involved in various developmental processes, including neurogenesis and hematopoiesis, by influencing cell differentiation and development (Wang2015TLE4).

The protein is active in the nucleus, where it participates in transcriptional repression through mechanisms such as chromatin modification. TLE4, like other TLE family members, can recruit histone deacetylases, which alter chromatin structure to repress transcription (Chen2000GrouchoTLE). This activity is crucial for maintaining the transcriptional silence of specific genes, thereby regulating cellular processes and developmental pathways.

TLE4's role in transcriptional repression is facilitated by its conserved domains, including the N-terminal glutamine-rich domain for tetramerization and the C-terminal WD-repeat domain for protein-protein interactions (Chen2000GrouchoTLE). These structural features enable TLE4 to form complexes with other proteins, enhancing its ability to modulate gene expression and contribute to cellular and organismal outcomes.

## Clinical Significance
TLE4, a transcriptional corepressor, plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Alterations in TLE4 expression, particularly its reduced expression, are associated with specific AML subtypes, such as those involving the t(8;21) translocation and del(9q) deletion. These genetic changes can cooperate with the AML1-ETO fusion protein to promote leukemogenesis by enhancing myeloid cell proliferation and survival (Dayyani2008Loss). TLE4 acts as a tumor suppressor, and its knockdown leads to increased cell growth, decreased apoptosis, and maintenance of leukemia cells in an undifferentiated state. This suggests that TLE4 loss contributes to the development and progression of AML by affecting cell cycle dynamics and differentiation (Shin2016TLE4).

In murine models, Tle4 knockout results in severe hematopoietic defects, including bone marrow aplasia and reduced hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, leading to early mortality. These findings highlight TLE4's critical role in maintaining normal hematopoiesis and suggest that its dysregulation can lead to hematological disorders (Wheat2014The). The loss of TLE4 is also linked to increased Wnt signaling and a pro-inflammatory signature, further implicating its role in leukemic cell survival and proliferation (Shin2016TLE4).

## Interactions
TLE4, a member of the Groucho/TLE family of corepressors, participates in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function as a transcriptional corepressor. TLE4 interacts with homeobox proteins such as Gbx2 and Otx2 through its WD40 repeat domain. This interaction is mediated by the eh1-like motifs present in Gbx2 and Otx2, which are essential for Groucho-dependent transcriptional repression (Heimbucher2007Gbx2). The WD40 domain of TLE4 is critical for these interactions, as demonstrated by experiments showing that a TLE4 mutant lacking this domain fails to mediate transcriptional repression (Heimbucher2007Gbx2).

TLE4 also interacts with Tcf/Lef family transcription factors, which are downstream effectors in the Wnt/Wingless signaling pathway. These interactions are important for regulating gene expression in response to Wnt signaling (Brantjes2001All). TLE4 can associate with histone deacetylases (HDACs), which is part of its mechanism for repressing transcription by modulating chromatin structure (Brantjes2001All). These interactions highlight TLE4's role in various cellular processes, including development and differentiation.
