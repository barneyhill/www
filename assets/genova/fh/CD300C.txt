# CD300C

## Overview
CD300C is a gene that encodes the CD300c protein, a member of the CD300 family of immunoregulatory receptors. The CD300c protein is a transmembrane receptor predominantly expressed on various immune cells, including antigen-presenting cells and basophils. It plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses by acting as both a co-inhibitory and costimulatory molecule, depending on the cellular context. CD300c is involved in the regulation of T cell proliferation and cytokine production, as well as in enhancing basophil activation during allergic responses. The receptor interacts with adaptor proteins such as the Fc receptor gamma chain and binds to lipids like phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine, which are important for its function in immune modulation (Zenarruzabeitia2019CD300c; Cui2018A; Takahashi2013Human).

## Function
CD300C is a co-inhibitory molecule that plays a significant role in modulating immune responses. It is expressed on various immune cells, including antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as B cells, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells, and interacts with a counter-receptor on CD4 and CD8 T cells (Cui2018A). Functionally, CD300C inhibits T cell proliferation, activation, and cytokine production, suggesting its involvement in T cell regulation (Cui2018A). This inhibition is observed in both human and mouse T cells, indicating a conserved function across species (Cui2018A).

CD300C also plays a role in the regulation of basophil activation, acting as a costimulatory receptor during IgE-mediated responses. It enhances basophil activation, leading to increased degranulation and cytokine production, which are crucial in allergic reactions (Zenarruzabeitia2019CD300c). The receptor is upregulated in response to IL-3 and is associated with the severity of allergic symptoms, particularly in conditions like cow's milk allergy (Zenarruzabeitia2019CD300c).

In plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), CD300C is involved in the regulation of cytokine secretion, particularly influencing the balance between type I interferon and TNF-α production (Ju2008CD300ac).

## Interactions
CD300C is an activating receptor that interacts with several adaptor proteins to mediate immune responses. It physically associates with the Fc receptor gamma chain (FcRγ), which is crucial for its surface expression and activation signaling in mast cells and monocytes. This interaction is necessary for the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and cytokine production upon stimulation (Takahashi2013Human). CD300C does not interact with other adaptor molecules such as DAP10, DAP12, or CD3 (Takahashi2013Human).

CD300C also interacts with phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), which are lipids found on apoptotic cells. These interactions are important for its role in immune modulation, as they can influence phagocytosis and cytokine production (Vitallé2018CD300; Takahashi2013Human). The receptor's ability to bind these lipids is attributed to specific amino acid residues in its extracellular domain (Takahashi2013Human).

In basophils, CD300C acts as a costimulatory receptor for FcεRI-mediated signals, enhancing degranulation and cytokine production when engaged with its ligands or specific monoclonal antibodies (Zenarruzabeitia2019CD300c). These interactions highlight CD300C's role in modulating immune responses through its associations with both proteins and lipids.
