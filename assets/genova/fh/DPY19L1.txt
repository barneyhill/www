# DPY19L1

## Overview
The DPY19L1 gene encodes the dpy-19 like C-mannosyltransferase 1, a multi-transmembrane protein that belongs to the GT-C superfamily of glycosyltransferases. This protein is characterized by its 13 transmembrane domains, which are essential for its function as a C-mannosyltransferase, facilitating the transfer of mannose to tryptophan residues in proteins (AlbuquerqueWendt2019Membrane; Minakata2021Protein). DPY19L1 plays a critical role in the radial migration of glutamatergic neurons during cerebral cortex development, with its expression being specific to these neurons and following a distinct gradient pattern (Watanabe2011Dpy19l1). The protein's involvement in neuronal migration suggests its potential participation in signaling pathways and cell adhesion processes. Additionally, DPY19L1 has been implicated in various developmental abnormalities and diseases, including its potential role as a biomarker in glioma and other cancers (Lin2022Predictive). Despite its significant biological roles, detailed interactions of DPY19L1 with other proteins or nucleic acids remain to be fully elucidated (Ghosh2021Interactome).

## Structure
The DPY19L1 protein is a member of the GT-C superfamily of glycosyltransferases, characterized by a complex membrane topology with 13 transmembrane domains (TMDs) (AlbuquerqueWendt2019Membrane; Minakata2021Protein). These TMDs are integral to its function as a C-mannosyltransferase, facilitating the transfer of mannose to tryptophan residues in proteins (Minakata2021Protein). The protein's structure includes conserved motifs in luminal loops, such as the ExE motif after the first TMD and the Rx6LRE motif in the second luminal loop, which are crucial for its enzymatic activity (AlbuquerqueWendt2019Membrane).

The tertiary structure of DPY19L1 is suggested to be complex, with a large C-terminal luminal domain that is not conserved with STT3 enzymes, indicating a unique role in substrate binding (AlbuquerqueWendt2019Membrane). Specific amino acid residues, including R211, E220, and R471, are essential for C-mannosylation activity, highlighting their importance in the protein's function (Minakata2021Protein). The protein's activity is linked to its ability to interact with specific motifs, such as W-x-x-W-x-x-W-x-x-C, acting on the first two tryptophan residues (Minakata2021Protein). The structural integrity of DPY19L1 is vital for its role in protein folding and secretion processes.

## Function
The DPY19L1 gene encodes a multi-transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in the radial migration of glutamatergic neurons during the development of the cerebral cortex. This protein is specifically expressed in glutamatergic neurons and is not found in GABAergic neurons during embryonic development (Watanabe2011Dpy19l1). The expression of DPY19L1 follows a lateromedial and rostral-to-caudal gradient within the cerebral cortex, with high levels in the cortical plate and intermediate zone, areas critical for neuronal migration (Watanabe2011Dpy19l1).

DPY19L1 is essential for the proper positioning of neurons, as its knockdown results in significant migration defects, with neurons failing to reach their intended positions and instead remaining in the intermediate zone or deep cortical layers (Watanabe2011Dpy19l1). Despite these migration defects, the specification of cell types is not affected, as knockdown cells still express markers typical of cortical neurons (Watanabe2011Dpy19l1).

The protein may interact with known migration regulators and participate in signaling pathways that regulate neuronal migration during corticogenesis. Given its nature as a multi-transmembrane protein, DPY19L1 might mediate extracellular signals or be part of the cell adhesion machinery (Watanabe2011Dpy19l1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the DPY19L1 gene have been linked to various developmental abnormalities and diseases. In mouse models, knockout of the DPY19L1 gene has been associated with several phenotypic abnormalities, including an enlarged heart, small kidney, abnormal seminal vesicles, and decreased fasting glucose levels in blood. These findings suggest that defects in C-mannosylation, potentially due to DPY19L1 gene mutations, may lead to a variety of developmental disorders (Minakata2021Protein).

In the context of cancer, overexpression of DPY19L1 mRNA has been linked to higher grades of gliomas and reduced survival rates in patients, indicating its potential role as a predictive biomarker and therapeutic target in glioma treatment (Lin2022Predictive). Although the study of DPY19L1 in human gliomas is relatively new, its expression has also been noted in other cancers, such as lung and colon cancers, suggesting a broader implication in oncogenesis (Lin2022Predictive).

While specific human diseases directly linked to DPY19L1 mutations are not extensively documented, its role in neuronal migration and potential involvement in neurological conditions like lissencephaly and subcortical band heterotopia (SBH) have been suggested based on its function in neuronal development (Watanabe2011Dpy19l1).

## Interactions
The DPY19L1 protein is involved in the radial migration of glutamatergic neurons in the developing cerebral cortex, but specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids have not been detailed in the available studies (Watanabe2011Dpy19l1). The research by Watanabe et al. primarily focuses on the gene's expression and its role in neuronal migration, without providing specific information on direct protein-protein interactions (Watanabe2011Dpy19l1).

In the context of SARS-CoV-2, the DPY19L1 protein has been identified as interacting with the ORF9c protein of the virus. However, the nature of this interaction, whether it is a direct physical interaction or part of a larger protein-protein interaction network, is not specified in the available data (Ghosh2021Interactome). The study by Ghosh et al. focuses on identifying human hub proteins that interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins, but detailed interactions involving DPY19L1 are not provided (Ghosh2021Interactome).

Overall, while DPY19L1 is implicated in important biological processes, specific details about its physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids remain to be elucidated.
