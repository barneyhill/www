# PBX1

## Overview
PBX1 is a gene that encodes the PBX homeobox 1 protein, a member of the TALE (Three Amino acid Loop Extension) family of transcription factors. This protein plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression during embryonic development and cellular differentiation. PBX1 is characterized by its homeodomain, which facilitates DNA binding and interaction with other transcription factors, and its PBC domains, which are crucial for forming complexes with MEINOX proteins such as MEIS and PKNOX. These interactions are essential for its function in tissue morphogenesis and organogenesis (Selleri2019‘Building; Mary2022The). PBX1 is involved in various biological processes, including hematopoiesis, skeletal development, and organogenesis, and its dysregulation is associated with developmental disorders and diseases such as congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) (Le2017PBX1haploinsufficiency; Selleri2019‘Building).

## Structure
The PBX1 protein is a TALE (Three Amino acid Loop Extension) transcription factor characterized by a homeodomain (HD) and two protein-protein-interacting domains, PBC-A and PBC-B. The homeodomain is crucial for DNA binding and interaction with other transcription factors, while the PBC domains facilitate interactions with MEINOX proteins, such as PKNOX and MEIS, which are essential for PBX1's DNA-binding capabilities (Mary2022The). The homeodomain of PBX1 contains a surface that binds the pentapeptide motif, which is crucial for cooperative DNA binding with Hox proteins (Lu1996Structural).

The PBX1 protein also includes a poly-alanine stretch between the PBC-A and PBC-B domains, which enhances DNA-binding ability by favoring conformational changes (Mary2022The). The nuclear localization signals (NLS) within the homeodomain are critical for the protein's function as a transcription factor, and mutations affecting these signals can lead to altered cellular localization (Eozenou2019The).

PBX1 can form heterodimers or heterotrimers with various partners, including PKNOX1, PKNOX2, MEIS1, MEIS2, FOXC1, and HOX proteins, which influence its quaternary structure (Mary2022The). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which affect its activity and interactions (Mary2022The). Splice variants of PBX1 can lead to different isoforms with distinct functions (Mary2022The).

## Function
PBX1 (PBX homeobox 1) is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in various molecular processes and cellular functions in healthy human cells. It is part of the TALE (three-amino acid loop extension) family of transcription factors and is involved in regulating gene expression during development by forming complexes with other proteins, such as HOX and MEIS, to influence tissue morphogenesis and organogenesis (Selleri2019‘Building; Mary2022The).

In hematopoiesis, PBX1 is essential for maintaining the quiescence and self-renewal of long-term hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Its absence leads to premature differentiation and exhaustion of these stem cells, affecting their ability to repopulate and expand clonally (Selleri2019‘Building; Ficara2008Pbx1). PBX1 also influences the production of common myeloid and lymphoid progenitors, playing a role in immune function by activating transcription of Interleukin-10 in macrophages (Selleri2019‘Building).

In skeletal development, PBX1 acts as a negative regulator of osteoblastogenesis by repressing Hoxa10-mediated gene transcription, impacting bone formation and mineral density (Gordon2010Pbx1; Cheung2008PreBcell). It is also involved in the development of various organs, including the thymus, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, and kidneys, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal organ development and function (Selleri2019‘Building).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PBX1 gene are associated with a range of developmental disorders and diseases. PBX1 haploinsufficiency is linked to syndromic congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), which include conditions such as bilateral renal hypoplasia and renal dysplasia. These anomalies are often accompanied by extrarenal symptoms like developmental delays, hearing defects, and facial dysmorphism (Le2017PBX1haploinsufficiency). 

De novo deleterious sequence variants in PBX1 have been identified in patients with intellectual disability and pleiotropic developmental defects, including craniofacial, cardiac, and renal abnormalities. These mutations disrupt PBX1's transactivation ability and nuclear translocation, affecting the transcription of target genes crucial for embryonic development (Slavotinek2017De). 

A specific missense mutation, c.704 G>T (p.Arg235Gln), affects PBX1's protein interactions and nuclear localization, leading to developmental disorders such as CAKUT syndrome, characterized by kidney and gonadal abnormalities (Eozenou2019The). 

PBX1 mutations can also result in loss of function variations, leading to renal and urinary tract anomalies, cardiac malformations, and dysplastic ears. Missense variations in the homeodomain and nuclear localization signal can cause severe genital anomalies and lung hypoplasia (Mary2022The).

## Interactions
PBX1, a TALE homeodomain transcription factor, interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in gene regulation. It forms dimers with MEINOX proteins, such as MEIS and PREP, which are essential for its nuclear localization and function. The interaction with MEINOX proteins involves the MEIS-A and -B domains, while the interaction with HOX proteins requires the homeodomain (HD) region (Longobardi2013Biochemistry). PBX1 also forms ternary complexes with MEINOX and HOX proteins, enhancing DNA binding specificity and selectivity (Longobardi2013Biochemistry).

PBX1 interacts with HOX proteins, such as HOXA-1, HOXD-4, and HoxB7, through a conserved pentapeptide motif, facilitating cooperative DNA binding. This interaction is crucial for the formation of stable DNA-protein complexes (Chang1995Pbx; Phelan1995Cooperative). The PBX1-HOX complexes bind to specific DNA sequences, with PBX1 contacting the TGAT half of the binding site (Berthelsen1998The).

PBX1 also interacts with KLF4 and TLX1 (HOX11), with implications in tumorigenesis and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (Longobardi2013Biochemistry). The interaction with PREP1 is necessary for the nuclear localization of both proteins, and phosphorylation of serine residues in the PBC-B domain of PBX1 regulates its nuclear localization (Longobardi2013Biochemistry).
