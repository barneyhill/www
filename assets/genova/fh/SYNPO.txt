# SYNPO

## Overview
The SYNPO gene encodes synaptopodin, a proline-rich, actin-associated protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Synaptopodin is categorized as a cytoskeletal protein and is expressed in various isoforms, including those found in kidney podocytes and neurons. The protein is integral to the formation and function of dendritic spines in neurons and the structural integrity of podocytes in the kidney. Synaptopodin's interactions with actin and actin-binding proteins, such as α-actinin, are crucial for its role in synaptic plasticity and cytoskeletal dynamics. Additionally, synaptopodin is involved in the formation of the spine apparatus, a specialized structure associated with synaptic function, and its dysregulation has been linked to several clinical conditions, including autism spectrum disorders and neurodegenerative diseases (Hu2023Autismrelated; kremerskothen2005synaptopodin; Asanuma2005Synaptopodin).

## Structure
The SYNPO gene encodes the synaptopodin protein, which is a proline-rich, actin-associated protein involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Synaptopodin exists in multiple isoforms, including Synpo-long and Synpo-short. Synpo-long is a 903-amino acid protein expressed in kidney podocytes, while Synpo-short is a 685-amino acid protein expressed in the brain. These isoforms share the first 670 amino acids, with Synpo-long containing an additional 234-amino acid fragment known as Synpo-alt, which includes motifs for Ena/VASP and homer binding (Asanuma2012Synaptopodin).

The protein contains specific domains that mediate interactions with actin and α-actinin. The actin-binding domain spans amino acids 391-485, while the α-actinin binding domain is located at the carboxyterminus, between amino acids 752-903. This region is crucial for synaptopodin's postsynaptic targeting and interaction with α-actinin isoforms 1 and 2 (kremerskothen2005synaptopodin).

Synaptopodin also interacts with the KIBRA protein through its PPxY motifs, forming a 'fuzzy' complex with the WW2 domain of KIBRA, which remains largely disordered upon binding (Kwok2019Intrinsic).

## Function
Synaptopodin (SYNPO) is a cytoskeletal protein that plays a crucial role in the formation and function of dendritic spines in neurons. It is primarily located in mature dendritic spines, where it accumulates in the spine neck and is closely associated with the spine apparatus, a specialized structure of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. SYNPO is essential for the formation of the spine apparatus, which is involved in synaptic plasticity, a process critical for learning and memory (kremerskothen2005synaptopodin). 

SYNPO interacts with F-actin and α-actinin, two components of the cytoskeleton, through distinct binding domains. The central motif of SYNPO mediates its association with F-actin, while the C-terminal domain is necessary for binding to α-actinin. This interaction is crucial for the postsynaptic targeting and accumulation of SYNPO in neurons (kremerskothen2005synaptopodin). 

In addition to its role in neurons, SYNPO is involved in the regulation of actin-bundling activity in podocytes, specialized cells in the kidney. It interacts with α-actinin-4, contributing to the structural integrity of podocytes and maintaining the actin cytoskeleton dynamics necessary for proper kidney function (Asanuma2005Synaptopodin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SYNPO gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of autism spectrum disorders (ASD), SYNPO has been identified as a novel candidate gene. A study found a de novo deletion encompassing the SYNPO gene in a patient with ASD, suggesting its potential role in the disorder's pathophysiology (Bitar2019Identification). 

In neurodegenerative diseases, reduced expression of SYNPO has been associated with Alzheimer's disease. This reduction may lead to inefficient clearance of phosphorylated MAPT (tau) at postsynaptic densities, contributing to neurotoxicity (Ji2019BAG3). 

SYNPO is also crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of podocytes in the kidney. Its absence or altered expression can lead to impaired recovery from cytoskeletal disruptions, potentially resulting in conditions like nephrotic syndrome and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) (Asanuma2012Synaptopodin). 

Alterations in SYNPO interactions, particularly with proteins like KLHL17, can impact synaptic plasticity. Disruption of the SYNPO-KLHL17 interaction affects dendritic spine morphology and calcium dynamics, which are crucial for neuronal activation and may contribute to ASD (Hu2023Autismrelated).

## Interactions
Synaptopodin (SYNPO) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a crucial role in actin dynamics and synaptic function. It interacts with actin and actin-binding proteins such as α-actinin, specifically α-actinin-2 and α-actinin-4, in an isoform-specific manner. These interactions are important for the regulation of actin filament bundling and elongation, which is critical for the formation of dendritic spines and podocyte foot processes (Asanuma2005Synaptopodin).

Synaptopodin also interacts with myosins, including myosin Va, Vb, VI, and Id. These interactions are believed to be involved in the transport and anchoring of synaptopodin to dendritic spines, facilitating the formation of the spine apparatus, a specialized compartment in dendritic spines associated with synaptic function (GonzalezGallego2019Characterization; Konietzny2019Myosin).

The interaction with myosin V is particularly significant, as it regulates synaptopodin clustering and localization in hippocampal neurons. This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of synaptopodin to F-actin-rich areas, influencing synaptic maturation and the formation of the spine apparatus (Konietzny2019Myosin). These interactions highlight synaptopodin's role in the dynamic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in specialized cell compartments.
