# KIF14

## Overview
KIF14 is a gene that encodes the kinesin family member 14, a motor protein that plays a pivotal role in cell division and intracellular transport. As a member of the kinesin superfamily, KIF14 is characterized by its motor domain, which facilitates microtubule binding and ATPase activity, essential for its function in mitosis and cytokinesis (Carleton2006RNA; Arora2014KIF14). The protein's structure includes unique features such as a twisted central β-sheet and a wide-open nucleotide-binding pocket, which contribute to its high affinity for microtubules and its ability to stabilize them during cell division (Benoit2020Structural; Arora2014KIF14). KIF14 is involved in critical cellular processes, including chromosome congression, alignment, and cytokinesis, and interacts with various proteins to regulate these functions (Gruneberg2006KIF14; Ahmed2012KIF14). Clinically, alterations in KIF14 expression and mutations have been linked to several diseases, including cancer and primary microcephaly, highlighting its significance as a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Chen2022Role; Moawia2017Mutations).

## Structure
KIF14 is a motor protein that plays a critical role in cell division and intracellular transport. The primary structure of KIF14 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein chain. The secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, with a notable twist in the central β-sheet, which is approximately 10° beyond what is observed in other kinesins, resembling the 'rigor-like' state seen in myosins (Arora2014KIF14).

The tertiary structure of KIF14 involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, with the motor domain adopting a canonical α/β kinesin motor domain fold. This domain is characterized by a wide-open nucleotide-binding pocket and a twisted central β-sheet, which contributes to its high affinity for microtubules (Benoit2020Structural; Arora2014KIF14).

KIF14's quaternary structure includes the assembly of multiple subunits, with the neck-linker domain playing a crucial role in controlling nucleotide-induced conformational changes and coordinating the ATPase cycle between the two motor domains of the KIF14 dimer (Benoit2020Structural).

KIF14 contains specific domains such as the motor domain, which binds to microtubules, and coiled-coil regions that facilitate dimerization. The protein's structure allows it to adopt a rigor-like conformation, which is essential for its function in microtubule stabilization during cytokinesis (Arora2014KIF14).

## Function
KIF14 is a kinesin motor protein that plays a crucial role in cell cycle progression, particularly during mitosis and cytokinesis. It exhibits microtubule-dependent ATPase activity, which is essential for its function in cell division (Carleton2006RNA). During the cell cycle, KIF14 localizes to various cellular structures: it is found in the cytoplasm during interphase, moves to the nucleus at the onset of mitosis, and accumulates at spindle poles and microtubules during prophase and metaphase. In anaphase, KIF14 is concentrated at the spindle midzone and midbody, and during telophase, it is found at the contractile ring (Carleton2006RNA).

KIF14 is involved in chromosome congression and alignment, ensuring proper chromosome segregation and maintaining tension across kinetochore pairs (Zhu2005Functional). It is also essential for cytokinesis, as its depletion leads to cytokinesis failure and the formation of multinucleated cells (Carleton2006RNA; Gruneberg2006KIF14). KIF14 interacts with citron kinase, facilitating its localization to the central spindle and midbody, which is crucial for efficient cytokinesis (Gruneberg2006KIF14). This interaction highlights KIF14's role in the spatial control of protein kinases during cell division (Gruneberg2006KIF14).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the KIF14 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), KIF14 expression is associated with tumor characteristics and patient prognosis. High KIF14 expression correlates with worse disease-free survival and overall survival times, particularly in gastric and colorectal cancers, making it an independent prognostic factor for unfavorable outcomes (Chen2022Role). In CRC, KIF14 expression is down-regulated in tumor tissues compared to non-tumor tissues, and its aberrant expression is linked to vascular invasion (NeskaDługosz2021Prognostic).

KIF14 mutations are also linked to primary microcephaly, a condition characterized by reduced brain size and intellectual disability. These mutations impair cytokinesis, leading to binucleated cells and increased apoptosis, which contribute to the condition's clinical manifestations (Moawia2017Mutations). Additionally, KIF14 mutations have been identified as a cause of an autosomal recessive lethal fetal ciliopathy phenotype, associated with severe developmental abnormalities in the brain and kidneys (Filges2013Exome).

In breast cancer, KIF14 is overexpressed in a grade-dependent manner and is associated with more aggressive tumors and decreased survival time, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker and drug target (Corson2006KIF14).

## Interactions
KIF14 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes such as cytokinesis and cancer progression. It binds to the PDZ domain of Radil, a protein involved in cell adhesion and migration, negatively regulating Rap1-Radil-mediated signaling. This interaction is crucial for the localization of Radil on microtubules, affecting cell spreading and migration dynamics in breast cancer cells (Ahmed2012KIF14). KIF14 also interacts with Rap1a, modulating its signaling pathway by tethering Radil on microtubules, which is essential for integrin activation and cell-matrix adhesion (Ahmed2012KIF14).

In the context of cytokinesis, KIF14 interacts with citron kinase, a key player in cell division. This interaction is necessary for the proper localization of citron kinase to the central spindle and midbody, facilitating efficient cytokinesis (Gruneberg2006KIF14). KIF14's interaction with PRC1, another protein involved in cytokinesis, is mediated by its unique amino-terminal extension, which targets the central spindle and midbody (Gruneberg2006KIF14).

KIF14 also forms a complex with RFC3 in colorectal cancer cells, influencing cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. This interaction is significant for cancer progression, as KIF14 expression is upregulated in colorectal cancer tissues (Yu2024RFC3).
