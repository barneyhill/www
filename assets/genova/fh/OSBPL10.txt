# OSBPL10

## Overview
OSBPL10 is a gene that encodes the protein oxysterol-binding protein-like 10 (ORP10), which is a member of the oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) family. This family of proteins is primarily involved in lipid metabolism and intracellular transport. ORP10 is characterized by the presence of an oxysterol-binding domain (ORD) and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which facilitate its role in lipid binding and membrane association (Koriyama2010Variation; Nissilä2012ORP10). Unlike other OSBP family members, ORP10 lacks a FFAT motif and a transmembrane domain, which suggests a unique functional adaptation, including its association with microtubules (Kentala2016OSBPRelated). The protein plays a significant role in regulating lipid metabolism, particularly influencing the secretion of apolipoprotein B-100 and the synthesis of cholesterol and triglycerides (Perttilä2009OSBPL10). Genetic variations in OSBPL10 have been linked to metabolic syndrome risk factors, such as variations in serum triglyceride and LDL cholesterol levels, highlighting its clinical significance in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases (Koriyama2012Functions; Koriyama2010Variation).

## Structure
OSBPL10 encodes the protein ORP10, which is part of the oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) family. ORP10 contains several key structural domains that contribute to its function. It has an oxysterol-binding domain (ORD) and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which are crucial for its role in lipid metabolism and transport (Koriyama2010Variation; Nissilä2012ORP10). The PH domain specifically binds phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P), facilitating membrane association, particularly at the Golgi complex and plasma membrane (Nissilä2012ORP10).

ORP10 lacks a FFAT motif and a transmembrane domain, which are common in other OSBP family members, indicating a unique structural adaptation for its function (Koriyama2012Functions; Kentala2016OSBPRelated). Instead, ORP10 associates with microtubules through a predicted coiled-coil motif located near its C-terminus, which is essential for its microtubule targeting (Kentala2016OSBPRelated; Nissilä2012ORP10).

The protein's structure allows it to bind cholesterol and acidic phospholipids, although it does not bind oxysterols (Nissilä2012ORP10). The ORD domain's ability to extract cholesterol from phospholipid vesicles is affected by specific deletions, suggesting conformational changes in the protein (Nissilä2012ORP10). These structural features enable ORP10 to regulate lipid metabolism, particularly in the context of apolipoprotein B-100 secretion (Nissilä2012ORP10).

## Function
OSBPL10 encodes the protein ORP10, which is part of the oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) family involved in lipid metabolism and intracellular transport. ORP10 is characterized by an oxysterol-binding domain (ORD) and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which facilitate its binding to non-endoplasmic reticulum membranes and its dynamic association with microtubules (Koriyama2012Functions; Koriyama2010Variation). This association suggests a role in intracellular transport and organelle positioning, crucial for maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis (Perttilä2009OSBPL10).

In hepatocellular models, ORP10 has been shown to suppress lipid biosynthesis, as silencing the gene leads to increased cholesterol and triglyceride synthesis. This indicates that ORP10 plays a role in regulating lipid metabolism, particularly in the liver and intestine, where it influences the assembly of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (Perttilä2009OSBPL10). ORP10 also affects the accumulation of apolipoprotein B100, a component of low-density lipoproteins, suggesting its involvement in lipoprotein secretion (Perttilä2009OSBPL10).

Genetic studies have linked polymorphisms in OSBPL10 to variations in serum triglyceride and LDL cholesterol levels, implicating the gene in metabolic syndrome risk factors (Koriyama2012Functions; Koriyama2010Variation). These findings highlight the gene's potential impact on cholesterol regulation and lipid homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the OSBPL10 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. Genetic variations in OSBPL10 are associated with dyslipidaemias, characterized by high serum triglyceride levels and high LDL cholesterol levels, particularly in Finnish and Japanese populations. These variations are also linked to peripheral artery disease, suggesting a role in cardiovascular conditions (Liu2020Role).

In cancer, the circular RNA derived from OSBPL10, known as circOSBPL10, is implicated in gastric cancer. It is upregulated in gastric cancer tissues and promotes tumor growth, metastasis, and poor survival outcomes by sponging miR-136-5p and upregulating WNT2, a key player in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (Wang2019Circular). In cervical cancer, circOSBPL10 interacts with miR-1179 and UBE2Q1, promoting cell proliferation and migration, with FOXA1 identified as an upstream regulator (Yang2020FOXA1induced).

OSBPL10 is also identified as a biomarker in prostate cancer and is involved in maintaining cholesterol balance. A point mutation in OSBPL10 is considered a potential prognostic indicator for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (Ghashghaei2019Identification). In liver cancer, OSBPL10 expression correlates with immune infiltration and is associated with shorter overall survival (Tian2023The).

## Interactions
OSBPL10, a member of the oxysterol-binding protein family, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In pancreatic cancer, OSBPL10 interacts with cellular nucleic acid-binding protein (CNBP), a relationship crucial for promoting cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. This interaction is facilitated through co-immunoprecipitation assays and mass spectrometry, which reveal that CNBP directly binds to OSBPL10. The binding of OSBPL10 to CNBP affects the immune microenvironment by increasing IL-6 levels and promoting M2 macrophage polarization, which is associated with tumor progression (Huang2024Hypoxiainduced).

OSBPL10 is also involved in lipid metabolism, where it interacts with microtubules. ORP10, the protein encoded by OSBPL10, localizes on microtubules and colocalizes with β-tubulin, indicating an association with these structures. This interaction is significant for intracellular transport and organelle distribution, although ORP10 silencing does not significantly alter microtubule morphology (Perttilä2009OSBPL10).

In the context of dengue hemorrhagic fever, OSBPL10 is part of the LXR/RXR activation pathway, which is crucial for lipid metabolism and immune function regulation. This pathway involves interactions with RXRA, influencing the expression of genes related to lipid metabolism and immune response (Sierra2017OSBPL10).
