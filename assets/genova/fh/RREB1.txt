# RREB1

## Overview
RREB1 (ras responsive element binding protein 1) is a gene that encodes a zinc finger transcription factor involved in the regulation of gene expression in response to Ras signaling pathways. The RREB1 protein is characterized by its four tandem C2H2-type zinc finger domains, which facilitate its binding to specific DNA sequences, thereby influencing transcriptional activity. As a transcriptional repressor, RREB1 plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by modulating the MAPK signaling pathway, among others. It achieves this by forming complexes with other proteins, such as SIN3A and KDM1A, to regulate histone modifications and gene expression. RREB1 is implicated in various physiological processes, including growth, proliferation, and differentiation, and its dysregulation is associated with several diseases, including cancer and RASopathies (Kent2020Haploinsufficiency; Thiagalingam1996RREB1).

## Structure
RREB1 (ras responsive element binding protein 1) is a zinc finger transcription factor characterized by its primary structure, which includes a protein of 755 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 89 kDa. The protein contains four tandem C2H2-type zinc finger domains, which are crucial for its DNA-binding capability (Thiagalingam1996RREB1). These zinc fingers are the primary structural feature of RREB1, facilitating its interaction with specific DNA sequences, particularly those with a bias toward C and A bases, as identified through a process called CASTing (Thiagalingam1996RREB1).

The RREB1 protein also contains several putative phosphorylation sites, including one for MAPK near the predicted C terminus, suggesting that post-translational modifications may regulate its activity (Thiagalingam1996RREB1). The protein's ability to bind DNA and activate gene expression is demonstrated through various assays, indicating its role in gene regulation (Thiagalingam1996RREB1).

RREB1 is expressed in various human tissues, with a notable absence in the adult brain, and its expression is upregulated during ras-induced differentiation, indicating a regulatory mechanism at the mRNA level by Ras (Thiagalingam1996RREB1). The presence of splice variant isoforms may further influence its function and localization, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
RREB1 (ras responsive element binding protein 1) is a zinc finger transcription factor that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression in response to Ras signaling pathways. In healthy human cells, RREB1 functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor within the MAPK signaling pathway. It forms a transcriptional repressive complex with SIN3A and KDM1A, leading to the transcriptional inactivation of MAPK signaling components by demethylating histone marks at target promoters. This repression prevents excessive activation of the MAPK pathway, maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing abnormal cell growth (Kent2020Haploinsufficiency).

RREB1 is involved in epigenetic regulation, affecting histone modifications such as H3K4me2, H3K4me3, and K9ac, which are typically found at active promoters. It recruits transcriptional repressors and chromatin remodeling proteins to target promoters, forming complexes that regulate histone modification and gene expression (Kent2020Haploinsufficiency). RREB1's activity is crucial for maintaining normal MAPK pathway signaling, which is important for various cellular processes, including growth, proliferation, and differentiation (Kent2020Haploinsufficiency). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it binds to specific DNA sequences to exert its regulatory functions (Kent2020Haploinsufficiency).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the RREB1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. RREB1 haploinsufficiency is associated with a Noonan-like RASopathy, a condition characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, craniofacial dysmorphism, and cardiac defects. This is due to the gene's role in regulating the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway, where its deficiency leads to increased signaling activity and epigenetic reprogramming of pathway genes (Kent2020Haploinsufficiency).

In cancer, RREB1 is involved in various malignancies, including colorectal cancer, where its deacetylation by miR-26a enhances tumor growth by activating the AKT-mediated glycolysis pathway (Chen2021miR26a). RREB1 mutations have also been identified in B-cell lymphoma, suggesting a role in lymphomagenesis through its involvement in MAPK and PI3K signaling (Rahrmann2019Sleeping).

In the context of diabetes, RREB1 influences insulin secretion and endocrine cell differentiation. Loss of RREB1 in pancreatic beta cells leads to reduced insulin content and altered expression of genes related to insulin secretion, potentially impacting glucose homeostasis and contributing to type 2 diabetes risk (Mattis2023Loss).

## Interactions
RREB1 (ras responsive element binding protein 1) is a zinc finger transcription factor that engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, influencing gene expression and cellular processes. It is a component of the CtBP corepressor complex, indicating its role as a transcriptional repressor (Deng2020Transcription). RREB1 interacts with the MAPK signaling pathway, where it is activated through the Ras-Raf-MEK-MAPK cascade (Deng2020Transcription). It binds to Ras-responsive elements (RREs) within gene promoters, such as the calcitonin gene, to regulate transcription (Deng2020Transcription).

RREB1 forms a transcriptional repressive complex with SIN3A and KDM1A, which is crucial for the transcriptional inactivation of MAPK signaling components (Kent2020Haploinsufficiency). This complex is involved in epigenetic regulation, affecting histone modifications like H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 (Kent2020Haploinsufficiency). RREB1 also interacts with the androgen receptor to regulate PSA expression in prostate cancer (Deng2020Transcription).

In glioma stem cells, RREB1 interacts with circNCAPG, which enhances its nuclear translocation and stability, promoting the activation of the TGF-β pathway (Li2023The). These interactions highlight RREB1's role in regulating various physiological pathways and gene expressions.
