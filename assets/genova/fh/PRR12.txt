# PRR12

## Overview
PRR12 is a gene that encodes the proline-rich protein 12, a nuclear factor involved in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling. The PRR12 protein is characterized by its proline-rich regions and structural domains that facilitate interactions with DNA and other proteins. It plays a critical role in maintaining genomic integrity, particularly through its involvement in the DNA damage response and regulation of the cohesin complex, which is essential for proper DNA replication and repair. PRR12's interactions with key proteins in these pathways underscore its importance in cellular processes. Clinically, mutations in the PRR12 gene are associated with a spectrum of neurodevelopmental and ocular disorders, highlighting its significance in human development and neurological function (Nguyen2024CoEssentiality; Reis2020Dominant).

## Structure
The PRR12 protein is a proline-rich nuclear factor composed of 2036 amino acids, characterized by several structural features that influence its function. The primary structure includes two AT-hook DNA binding domains, which are motifs that bind to the minor grooves of AT-rich DNA sequences, playing a role in DNA-dependent processes (Leduc2018De). The N-terminal region of PRR12 is largely unstructured, potentially containing polyproline helices, while the C-terminal region is more structured, featuring two highly-conserved domains: binding domain 1 and binding domain 2. Binding domain 1 consists of eight contorted anti-parallel beta-sheets and two helices, whereas binding domain 2 contains a bundle of seven helices flanked by three antiparallel beta-sheets (Nguyen2024CoEssentiality).

Post-translational modifications of PRR12 include acetylation and phosphorylation. A notable acetylation site is the N6-acetyllysine at amino acid position 402, and multiple serine/threonine phosphorylation sites have been identified, suggesting roles in epigenetic regulation (Leduc2018De). The protein also contains a glycine-rich region and several proline-rich regions, which may facilitate the formation of larger protein complexes (Muscò2024Shedding). These structural features suggest that PRR12 is involved in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling.

## Function
The PRR12 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic integrity and regulating the cohesin complex in healthy human cells. PRR12 is involved in the DNA damage response, particularly in the repair of double-strand breaks, by interacting with DNA damage regulators and co-localizing with NIPBL at DNA damage sites (Nguyen2024CoEssentiality). It contributes to the stability of cohesin on DNA, and its absence leads to a reduction in nuclear-localized cohesin, which can be rescued by co-depleting the cohesin destabilizer protein WAPL (Nguyen2024CoEssentiality). PRR12 interacts with the cohesin complex through its C-terminal domain, likely mediated by the NIPBL/MAU2 complex, and is involved in DNA replication and topological stress relief through its interaction with the MCM replicative helicase complex (Nguyen2024CoEssentiality).

PRR12 is nuclear-localized during interphase and shows dynamic changes in localization throughout the cell cycle, with levels increasing significantly in the S and G2 phases (Nguyen2024CoEssentiality). Despite its non-essential role in most human cell lines, PRR12 is crucial for development and neurological function, as mutations in PRR12 lead to severe impairments in humans (Nguyen2024CoEssentiality).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PRR12 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental and ocular disorders. These include complex microphthalmia, characterized by small eyes with additional abnormalities, and Peters anomaly, which involves corneal opacity and other anterior segment dysgenesis (Reis2020Dominant). PRR12 mutations have also been linked to intellectual disability, neuropsychiatric disorders, and specific eye anomalies such as iris coloboma and foveal hypoplasia (Leduc2018De; Reis2020Dominant). 

De novo loss-of-function mutations in PRR12 have been identified in patients with intellectual disabilities and iris abnormalities, suggesting a role in neurodevelopmental disorders (Leduc2018De). These mutations often lead to nonsense-mediated decay of mRNA, indicating haploinsufficiency as a potential disease mechanism (Leduc2018De). 

PRR12 is also implicated in a syndrome characterized by neurodevelopmental, eye, and behavioral alterations, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Muscò2024Shedding). A case study involving a chromosomal translocation disrupting PRR12 and ZMIZ1 genes further highlights its role in intellectual disability and neuropsychiatric alterations (Córdova-Fletes2015A). These findings underscore the clinical significance of PRR12 in various developmental and neurological conditions.

## Interactions
PRR12 is known to interact with several proteins, particularly those involved in the cohesin complex and DNA damage response. It co-localizes with the cohesin complex throughout the cell cycle, suggesting a potential interaction (Nguyen2024CoEssentiality). Affinity purification and mass spectrometry have identified that PRR12 immunoprecipitates with all established subunits of the cohesin complex and multiple cohesin-associated proteins, including NIPBL and MAU2 (Nguyen2024CoEssentiality). Structural predictions indicate that the C-terminus of PRR12 contains two highly-conserved domains involved in these interactions, with binding domain 1 composed of anti-parallel beta-sheets and helices, and binding domain 2 containing a bundle of helices flanked by beta-sheets (Nguyen2024CoEssentiality).

PRR12 also plays a role in DNA damage response, co-localizing with NIPBL at sites of DNA damage and interacting with DNA damage response proteins such as γH2AX, TP53BP1, and RAD51B (Nguyen2024CoEssentiality). It is involved in the repair of DNA lesions, highlighting its essential role in maintaining genomic integrity (Nguyen2024CoEssentiality). Additionally, PRR12 interacts with the MCM replicative helicase complex, suggesting its involvement in DNA replication and repair (Nguyen2024CoEssentiality).
