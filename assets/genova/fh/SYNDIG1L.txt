# SYNDIG1L

## Overview
SYNDIG1L is a gene that encodes the protein synapse differentiation inducing 1 like, which plays a crucial role in the development and function of synapses in the nervous system. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein, indicating its involvement in cellular signaling and communication across the cell membrane. Synapse differentiation inducing 1 like is implicated in the modulation of synaptic plasticity, which is essential for learning and memory processes. The gene's expression and the protein's function are of significant interest in the study of neurological disorders, as alterations in synaptic function are often linked to various neuropathologies (Qiu2020aarFDC).
