# PAGE1

## Overview
PAGE1 (P antigen family member 1) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the cancer testis antigen (CTA) family, specifically expressed in testicular tissue and various cancer types. The protein encoded by PAGE1 is part of the CT-X gene family, which is notable for its restricted expression in normal somatic tissues, making it a potential target for cancer immunotherapy (Hofmann2008Genomewide). PAGE1 is implicated in the pathology of several cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma, where its expression is linked to tumor recurrence and survival outcomes (Noordam2021Expression). The gene's expression profile suggests its utility as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis and prognosis, as well as a candidate for vaccine development against cancer (Bodey2002Cancertestis).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
PAGE1, a member of the cancer testis antigen (CTA) family, is primarily expressed in various cancers and testis tissues, making it a potential biomarker for certain malignancies. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PAGE1 is expressed in more than 10% of tumors, and its presence in tumor-free liver tissues is associated with HCC recurrence and specific survival outcomes, indicating its potential clinical significance in HCC prognosis (Noordam2021Expression). The expression of PAGE1 in tumor-adjacent normal liver tissues suggests the possibility of occult metastasis or early malignant transformations, which could be crucial for understanding tumor biology and recurrence risks (Noordam2021Expression).

PAGE1 is also part of the CT-X gene family, which is characterized by its restricted expression in somatic tissues, making it a promising target for cancer vaccine development (Hofmann2008Genomewide). Despite its potential as a therapeutic target, specific mutations or interaction changes of PAGE1 in diseases are not detailed in the available literature. However, its expression patterns in various cancers, including prostate and testicular cancers, highlight its relevance in cancer diagnosis and therapy (Bodey2002Cancertestis).
