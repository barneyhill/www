# RNASE4

## Overview
RNASE4 is a gene that encodes the protein ribonuclease A family member 4, a member of the ribonuclease A superfamily. This protein is characterized by its role in RNA metabolism, specifically in cleaving single-stranded RNA, which is essential for regulating RNA stability and turnover. RNASE4 is predominantly expressed in the liver and secreted by endothelial cells, playing a significant role in various biological processes, including angiogenesis, neuroprotection, and potentially antiviral activities (Lee2019Functional). The protein's interactions with signaling pathways, such as the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, and its involvement in diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Huntington's disease, highlight its clinical significance (Vanli2022Ribonuclease; Dong2018Identification). Despite its importance, the precise physiological functions of RNASE4 remain less understood, necessitating further research to fully elucidate its role in cellular and organismal biology (Lee2019Functional).

## Structure
RNASE4 is a highly conserved member of the ribonuclease A superfamily, characterized by a polypeptide chain of 119 amino acids. The primary structure includes a pyroglutamic acid residue at position 1 and lacks a recognition site for N-glycosylation (Hofsteenge1998Ribonuclease). The enzyme shares a high degree of sequence similarity with RNase 1, including the conservation of four disulfide bridges, which are crucial for maintaining its tertiary structure (Hofsteenge1998Ribonuclease).

Although no experimentally determined three-dimensional structure is available, comparative modeling suggests that RNASE4 has a similar overall fold to RNase A, with a notable difference in the conformation of the loop between residues 58-71 (Hofsteenge1998Ribonuclease). This loop variation may influence the enzyme's substrate specificity, particularly its preference for cleaving after uridine (Hofsteenge1998Ribonuclease).

RNASE4 is expressed in various tissues, with the highest levels found in the liver, and is secreted primarily by endothelial cells (Lee2019Functional). The gene shares promoters and 5′-untranslated regions with angiogenin (ANG), suggesting a functional relationship and coexpression (Sheng2016Three). The evolutionary conservation of RNASE4 indicates its specialized function in RNA-protein interactions.

## Function
Human RNASE4 is a member of the ribonuclease A superfamily, known for its role in RNA metabolism, specifically in cleaving single-stranded RNA. This activity is crucial for regulating RNA stability and turnover, impacting cellular processes such as growth and differentiation (Lee2019Functional). RNASE4 is predominantly secreted by endothelial cells and is found in various biological fluids, including blood, saliva, and seminal fluid, with the highest expression levels in the liver (Lee2019Functional). 

In healthy human cells, RNASE4 is involved in angiogenesis, neuroprotection, and potentially antiviral activities, although these functions are not as well characterized as those of its closely related counterpart, RNASE5 (also known as angiogenin) (Lee2019Functional). The protein's secretion and activity in the extracellular space contribute to maintaining cellular homeostasis and immune response, suggesting a complementary or supplementary role to RNASE5 in these processes (Lee2019Functional). Despite its significant presence and potential roles, the precise physiological functions of RNASE4 in healthy human cells remain less understood, warranting further research to elucidate its specific contributions to cellular and organismal biology (Lee2019Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RNASE4 gene have been implicated in several diseases, notably amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Huntington's disease (HD). In ALS, rare variants of RNASE4, such as M29I, H72P, and R95W, have been identified as potentially deleterious due to their impact on the gene's ribonucleolytic and nuclear translocation activities. These variants may contribute to ALS susceptibility by causing a loss of function, similar to mutations observed in the related gene ANG (Padhi2019A).

In the context of HD, RNASE4 is significantly upregulated, suggesting a protective role against neuronal degeneration. The gene is involved in neuroprotective activities, including promoting angiogenesis and neuronal survival under stress. This upregulation is part of a regulatory pathway involving miRNA-124 and STAT3, which could be targeted for HD treatment (Dong2018Identification).

RNASE4 also plays a role in cellular senescence by interacting with the p53 protein. It helps regulate p53-mediated cell fate decisions, potentially inhibiting apoptosis in senescent cells. This interaction is crucial for the survival of senescent cells, and alterations in RNASE4 expression or function could impact aging and cancer-related outcomes (Sturmlechner2022Senescent).

## Interactions
RNASE4, a member of the ribonuclease A superfamily, is known for its interactions with various proteins and nucleic acids. It is involved in the activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation. This activation involves the phosphorylation of AKT and S6, processes that can be inhibited by specific inhibitors, indicating that RNASE4's effect on cell proliferation is mediated through this pathway (Vanli2022Ribonuclease). RNASE4 also interacts with the AXL receptor tyrosine kinase, which is necessary for its function in promoting prostate cancer cell proliferation. The phosphorylation of AXL by RNASE4 has been confirmed, and inhibiting AXL reduces RNASE4-induced cell proliferation and phosphorylation of AKT and S6 (Vanli2022Ribonuclease).

In the context of Huntington's disease, RNASE4 is co-expressed with angiogenin (ANG) and shares promoters with it. This co-expression suggests a regulatory relationship that may protect against neuron degeneration by promoting angiogenesis and neuronal survival (Dong2018Identification). RNASE4's interactions with ribonuclease inhibitors are also notable, as it binds tightly to these inhibitors, which may influence its activity and interactions with other cellular components (Hofsteenge1998Ribonuclease).
