# TPK1

## Overview
The TPK1 gene encodes thiamine pyrophosphokinase 1, an enzyme that plays a pivotal role in thiamine metabolism by catalyzing the conversion of thiamine (vitamin B1) into thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), a vital cofactor for several enzyme complexes involved in energy production and metabolic processes (Zhao2023Thiamine; Li2022Case). As a kinase, thiamine pyrophosphokinase 1 is essential for maintaining cellular energy homeostasis, particularly within the mitochondria and cytoplasm, where it supports carbohydrate and fatty acid metabolism (Zhao2023Thiamine; Bugiardini2019Utility). Mutations in the TPK1 gene can lead to thiamine metabolism dysfunction syndrome 5 (THMD5), a disorder with significant neurological implications, underscoring the clinical importance of this gene and its encoded protein (Zhu2020Whole).

## Function
The TPK1 gene encodes the enzyme thiamine pyrophosphokinase 1, which is crucial for converting thiamine (vitamin B1) into thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) in human cells. TPP acts as a cofactor for several important enzyme complexes, including the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, the branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complex, and the oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex within the mitochondria (Bugiardini2019Utility; Li2022Case). These enzyme complexes are involved in critical metabolic pathways, such as carbohydrate metabolism, which are essential for cellular energy production and overall metabolic function (Li2022Case).

TPP is also a cofactor for cytosolic transketolase and peroxisomal 2-hydroxyacyl-CoA lyase 1, playing a role in the pentose phosphate pathway and fatty acid metabolism (Bugiardini2019Utility; Li2022Case). The TPK1 protein operates as a dimer and is essential for the phosphorylation of thiamine, facilitating its role in energy production and other metabolic processes (Zhao2023Thiamine). TPK1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it maintains adequate levels of TPP necessary for the proper functioning of these metabolic pathways (Zhao2023Thiamine).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TPK1 gene lead to thiamine metabolism dysfunction syndrome 5 (THMD5), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a range of neurological symptoms. These include acute or subacute onset encephalopathy, ataxia, muscle hypotonia, developmental regression, and seizures, often triggered by acute infections (Zhao2023Thiamine; Li2022Case). The clinical presentation is highly variable, with some patients experiencing spontaneous remission while others suffer from fatal metabolic crises (Zhu2020Whole). 

TPK1 mutations result in decreased levels of thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), a crucial cofactor in energy metabolism, leading to symptoms such as dystonia, dysarthria, and disturbances of consciousness (Zhu2019Identification; Zhao2023Thiamine). Imaging often reveals cerebellar involvement, and patients can be categorized into Leigh syndrome and non-Leigh syndrome groups based on imaging and lactate levels (Zhao2023Thiamine). 

Thiamine supplementation is the primary treatment for TPK1 deficiency, with varying degrees of effectiveness. Early intervention can significantly improve symptoms, but delayed treatment may result in irreversible brain damage (Zhao2023Thiamine; Li2022Case). Whole exome sequencing is recommended for molecular diagnosis, as it can identify novel mutations in the TPK1 gene (Zhu2020Whole).
