# AKAP17A

## Overview
AKAP17A is a gene that encodes the protein A-kinase anchoring protein 17A, which is a member of the A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) family. These proteins are known for their role in compartmentalizing Protein Kinase A (PKA) to specific locations within the cell, thereby facilitating localized signal transduction. AKAP17A is particularly involved in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing in a PKA-dependent manner, playing a significant role in RNA processing within the nucleus (Omar2020AKAP; Winge2017Transcriptome). The protein is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, influencing various cellular processes such as cell division, gene expression, and cytoskeletal dynamics (Omar2020AKAP). Despite its ubiquitous expression across different tissues, the protein is predominantly found in the blood, ovaries, and testis at the protein level (Winge2017Transcriptome). AKAP17A's involvement in splicing regulation and its association with age-related phenotypes underscore its importance in maintaining cellular function and organismal development (Lee2019The; Omar2020AKAP). However, the gene remains poorly characterized, necessitating further research to fully understand its functions and interactions (Lee2019The).

## Function
AKAP17A, also known as A-kinase anchoring protein 17A, is involved in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing in a Protein Kinase A (PKA)-dependent manner. It plays a crucial role in targeting PKA to specific subcellular compartments, particularly within the nucleus, where it is associated with the spliceosome and involved in RNA processing (Omar2020AKAP; Winge2017Transcriptome). AKAP17A is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, influencing cellular processes such as cell division, gene expression, and cytoskeletal dynamics (Omar2020AKAP).

In healthy human cells, AKAP17A is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, although its protein-level expression is limited to the blood, ovaries, and testis (Winge2017Transcriptome). The gene's involvement in splicing regulation is significant for maintaining cellular function and has been linked to age-related phenotypes, including cognitive and physical decline (Lee2019The). AKAP17A's role in anchoring PKA facilitates localized signal transduction, which is essential for precise cellular responses and organismal development (Omar2020AKAP). Despite its importance, AKAP17A remains poorly characterized, with ongoing research needed to fully elucidate its functions in healthy cells (Lee2019The).

## Clinical Significance
AKAP17A, also known as SFSR17A, is a splicing regulatory factor gene that has been associated with various aging phenotypes and diseases. Alterations in the expression levels of AKAP17A have been linked to cognitive decline and physical deterioration in aging populations. Specifically, its expression is associated with declines in cognitive performance, as measured by tests like the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Purdue Pegboard Test, as well as physical abilities such as handgrip strength and walking speed (Lee2019The). 

AKAP17A has also been implicated in Alzheimer's disease, as sequences from this gene are found among probes that differentiate Alzheimer's disease brain samples from controls. However, the association with physical function decline over time is not consistently replicated, suggesting variability in its impact (Lee2019The). 

Additionally, AKAP17A expression shows a significant correlation with interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels, a known biomarker of aging, indicating its potential role in age-related inflammatory processes (Lee2019The). While no direct functional role for AKAP17A in muscle function has been reported, its dysregulated expression in peripheral blood may serve as an indicator of future aging-related outcomes (Lee2019The).

## Interactions
AKAP17A is involved in various interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular signaling and regulation. It is associated with the spliceosome and the nucleus, indicating its potential involvement in nuclear signaling processes (Omar2020AKAP). AKAP17A functions as a splicing regulator, and alterations in its expression can affect downstream protein-coding genes, highlighting its role in gene expression mechanisms (Manotas2020Identification).

Despite its known associations, specific physical interactions of AKAP17A with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed in the provided context. The THAHIT tool, designed to identify amphipathic helices in AKAPs, did not retrieve the amphipathic helix for AKAP17A, suggesting that its interaction with PKA may involve a different mechanism or that the helix does not meet the stringent criteria set by the tool (Burgers2014A). This indicates that AKAP17A might interact with PKA through non-canonical means or other structural motifs not captured by current predictive tools. Further experimental validation is necessary to elucidate the specific interactions and mechanisms involving AKAP17A.
