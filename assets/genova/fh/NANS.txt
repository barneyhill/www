# NANS

## Overview
The NANS gene encodes the enzyme N-acetylneuraminate synthase, which is a critical component in the biosynthesis of sialic acids, specifically N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuNAc). This enzyme is categorized as a synthase and plays a pivotal role in cellular processes by catalyzing the conversion of N-acetylmannosamine-6-phosphate (ManNAc-6P) to NeuNAc, a precursor for sialylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids (Tran2021The; van2016NANSmediated). Sialic acids are essential for cellular communication, pathogen recognition, and protein stabilization, particularly in the brain and skeletal system (Masunaga2022Clinical). Mutations in the NANS gene can lead to significant developmental disorders, highlighting its importance in normal physiological function and development (van2016NANSmediated).

## Function
The NANS gene encodes the enzyme N-acetylneuraminic acid synthase, which is crucial for the biosynthesis of sialic acids, particularly N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuNAc) (van2016NANSmediated). This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of N-acetylmannosamine-6-phosphate (ManNAc-6P) to NeuNAc, a key component in the sialylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids (Tran2021The). Sialic acids are located at the terminal positions of sugar chains on glycoproteins and glycolipids, playing a significant role in cellular communication, pathogen recognition, and protein stabilization (Masunaga2022Clinical).

In healthy human cells, the NANS enzyme is active in the cytoplasm, where it facilitates the production of NeuNAc, which is then converted to CMP-NeuNAc by CMP-sialic acid synthase (CMAS) and transported to the Golgi apparatus for incorporation into glycoproteins and glycolipids (Tran2021The). This process is essential for proper cellular signaling and function, particularly in the brain and skeletal system, where sialic acids are abundant and critical for development and function (Masunaga2022Clinical; van2016NANSmediated). The NANS gene's activity ensures normal levels of NeuNAc, preventing the accumulation of precursor molecules like ManNAc, which can disrupt cellular processes (Tran2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NANS gene are linked to a genetic disorder characterized by severe intellectual developmental disorders (IDD) and skeletal dysplasia. This condition is associated with an inborn error of metabolism affecting the synthesis of N-acetyl neuraminic acid (NeuNAc; sialic acid), which is crucial for brain and skeletal development (van2016NANSmediated). Patients with NANS mutations exhibit clinical features such as muscle hypotonia, delayed developmental milestones, moderate to severe IDD, and distinct facial dysmorphisms. Neuro-imaging often reveals various brain abnormalities, while skeletal features include short stature and premature carpal ossification (van2016NANSmediated).

The mutations in the NANS gene lead to the accumulation of N-acetyl mannosamine (ManNAc) due to impaired enzyme activity, which affects the incorporation of ManNAc into sialoglycoproteins, confirming a functional impairment in the sialic acid biosynthesis pathway (van2016NANSmediated). This deficiency is considered among congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs) (van2016NANSmediated). Experiments with zebrafish have shown that knockdown of the nansa gene, an ortholog of human NANS, results in developmental anomalies in the skeleton, particularly in the head region, indicating the gene's role in skeletal development (van2016NANSmediated).
