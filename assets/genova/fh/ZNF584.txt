# ZNF584

## Overview
ZNF584 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 584, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are small protein structural motifs that can coordinate one or more zinc ions to help stabilize their folds. Zinc finger proteins are typically involved in DNA binding and play crucial roles in transcriptional regulation, cellular development, and differentiation. The specific functions of zinc finger protein 584, as encoded by ZNF584, are not fully elucidated, but it is believed to be involved in gene expression regulation through its interaction with DNA and possibly other proteins. The study of ZNF584 and its encoded protein is ongoing, with research focusing on its potential roles in various biological pathways and its implications in health and disease.
