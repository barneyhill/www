# DNAJC5

## Overview
DNAJC5 is a gene that encodes the protein cysteine-string protein alpha (CSPα), a member of the DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40). CSPα is a synaptic co-chaperone that plays a critical role in the nervous system by facilitating synaptic vesicle exocytosis and neurotransmitter release. As a co-chaperone of HSC70, CSPα is involved in maintaining synaptic function and preventing neurodegeneration by rescuing synaptic proteins unfolded by activity-dependent stress (Benitez2011ExomeSequencing). The protein is characterized by a conserved N-terminal J domain, a cysteine string domain (CSD) with heavily palmitoylated cysteine residues, and a less conserved C-terminal domain, which are essential for its membrane binding and function in unconventional protein secretion pathways (Wu2023Unconventional; Hasegawa2018DnaJHsp40). Mutations in DNAJC5 are associated with adult-onset neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (ANCL), a neurodegenerative disorder, highlighting its clinical significance (Huang2022AdultOnset).

## Structure
The DNAJC5 gene encodes the cysteine string protein α (CSPα), a synaptic co-chaperone of the DnaJ/Hsp40 family. The protein has a molecular weight of approximately 34 kDa and consists of several structural domains. It features a conserved N-terminal J domain, which is crucial for its co-chaperone activity, followed by a linker region, a cysteine string domain (CSD), and a less conserved C-terminal domain (Benitez2011ExomeSequencing; Hasegawa2018DnaJHsp40).

The cysteine string domain is characterized by 13-15 heavily palmitoylated cysteine residues within 25 amino acids, which are essential for membrane binding and oligomerization (Wu2023Unconventional; Hasegawa2018DnaJHsp40). Palmitoylation is a key post-translational modification that facilitates the protein's attachment to membranes and is critical for its function in α-synuclein secretion (Wu2023Unconventional).

Mutations in the cysteine string domain, such as p.L115R and p.L116del, affect the protein's palmitoylation and membrane association, leading to impaired function and aggregation (Benitez2011ExomeSequencing; Huang2022AdultOnset). DNAJC5 can form oligomers, which are involved in the unconventional secretion pathway of α-synuclein (Wu2023Unconventional). The protein's oligomerization propensity is linked to its role in synaptic vesicle function and neuroprotection (Wu2023Unconventional).

## Function
The DNAJC5 gene encodes cysteine-string protein α (CSPα), a co-chaperone of HSC70, which plays a significant role in synaptic vesicle exocytosis and neurotransmitter release in the nervous system. CSPα is a key component of the synaptic molecular machinery, accounting for 1% of all vesicle proteins, and is involved in synaptic vesicle localization and chaperone activity. It functions to rescue synaptic proteins unfolded by activity-dependent stress, thereby maintaining synaptic function and preventing neurodegeneration (Benitez2011ExomeSequencing).

DNAJC5 is heavily palmitoylated, which anchors it to late endosomes and facilitates its role in the unconventional secretion of proteins, such as α-synuclein, associated with neurodegenerative diseases. This process, known as misfolding-associated protein secretion (MAPS), is distinct from conventional secretion pathways and involves the extracellular release of proteins (Wu2023Unconventional; Xu2018DNAJC5). DNAJC5's membrane association is crucial for its function in MAPS, as it recruits substrates to late endosomes and lysosomes, promoting their entry into vesicles for secretion (Xu2018DNAJC5).

In healthy cells, DNAJC5 is involved in cellular communication and protein trafficking, with its oligomerization being a key factor in stimulating α-synuclein secretion (Wu2023Unconventional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DNAJC5 gene, which encodes the cysteine-string protein alpha (CSPα), are linked to adult-onset neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (ANCL), a neurodegenerative disorder. ANCL is characterized by the accumulation of lipofuscin in lysosomes, leading to symptoms such as progressive dementia, seizures, motor dysfunction, and personality changes (Koutras2014J; Huang2022AdultOnset). Specific mutations, including the deletion of leucine 116 (L116) and the leucine to arginine substitution at position 115 (L115R), are known to cause ANCL and are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner (Koutras2014J).

A novel mutation, C128Y, has been identified in the DNAJC5 gene, presenting with atypical symptoms such as early memory loss and parkinsonism, which differ from those associated with other known mutations (Huang2022AdultOnset). This mutation results in aberrant protein palmitoylation and oligomer formation, contributing to the disease pathology (Huang2022AdultOnset). The DNAJC5 gene is unique among NCL-related genes due to its autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, contrasting with the more common autosomal recessive pattern seen in other NCLs (Huang2022AdultOnset).

## Interactions
DNAJC5, also known as cysteine-string protein alpha (CSPα), is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in unconventional protein secretion and neuroprotection. DNAJC5 interacts with HSC70, forming a complex that facilitates the secretion of proteins such as α-synuclein and Tau through the misfolded-associated protein secretion (MAPS) pathway (Xu2018DNAJC5). This interaction is essential for the export of misfolded proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to late endosomes and eventually to the cell exterior (Xu2018DNAJC5).

DNAJC5 also interacts with USP19, a deubiquitinase that recruits misfolded proteins to the ER surface before transferring them to DNAJC5 for secretion (Xu2018DNAJC5). The protein's palmitoylation is crucial for its membrane association and function in the secretion process (Wu2023Unconventional). DNAJC5 forms oligomers that are important for the secretion of α-synuclein, and these oligomers may act as adaptors for diverse substrates (Wu2023Unconventional).

In addition to these interactions, DNAJC5 is known to associate with other proteins such as Hsp90 and SGT, which are involved in its role in synaptic maintenance and neuroprotection (Nogueira2023Cysteine). However, there is no evidence from the provided context that DNAJC5 interacts with nucleic acids.
