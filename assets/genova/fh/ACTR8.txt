# ACTR8

## Overview
ACTR8 is a gene that encodes actin-related protein 8, a member of the actin-related protein family, which shares structural similarities with conventional actin but is distinct in its nuclear localization and function. This protein is a critical component of the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex, playing a significant role in DNA replication, repair, recombination, transcription, and heterochromatin maintenance. Unlike typical actin proteins, actin-related protein 8 is involved in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation, primarily through its interaction with nucleosomes and core histones. It is characterized by its ATP-binding and nucleotide-binding domains, which are essential for its function within the INO80 complex (Brahma2018The; Choe2020A). The protein's ability to bind to extranucleosomal DNA and contribute to ATPase activity underscores its importance in maintaining chromatin structure and facilitating various cellular processes (Brahma2018The; Kristó2016Actin).

## Structure
The ACTR8 gene encodes a protein that is part of the actin-related protein family, sharing structural similarities with conventional actin. The full-length ACTR8 protein consists of 624 amino acids and includes essential domains such as ATP-binding and nucleotide-binding sites, which are crucial for its function (Choe2020A). The protein's structure is highly conserved across mammals, indicating its importance in cellular functions (Choe2020A).

ACTR8 is a component of the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex, where it plays a role in DNA binding and nucleosome positioning. The N-terminal region of ACTR8 is particularly important for its DNA binding function, as it interacts with extranucleosomal DNA and contributes to the ATPase activity of the INO80 complex (Brahma2018The). The protein's structure allows it to bind to core histones and single-stranded DNA, facilitating its involvement in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation (Kristó2016Actin).

ACTR8 also exhibits multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with some isoforms lacking the C-terminal region but retaining functional domains necessary for activity (Choe2020A). These isoforms contribute to the protein's functional diversity and its role in various cellular processes.

## Function
ACTR8, or actin-related protein 8, is a crucial component of the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex, which is involved in several essential cellular processes, including DNA replication, repair, recombination, transcription, and heterochromatin maintenance (Choe2020A). Unlike typical actin proteins, ACTR8 is primarily located in the nucleus, where it contributes to the ATPase activity of the INO80 complex and aids in recruiting the complex to sites of DNA damage (Choe2020A). 

ACTR8 also plays a significant role in mitotic chromosome alignment. It accumulates on mitotic chromosomes, a unique feature among actin family members, and is essential for proper chromosome alignment during mitosis. This function appears to be independent of the INO80 complex, as depletion of other INO80 components does not result in chromosome misalignment, unlike the depletion of ACTR8 (Aoyama2008The).

Structurally, ACTR8 has a typical actin fold with specific insertions that prevent polymerization, allowing it to function as a nucleosome recognition module. It shows a strong preference for binding to nucleosomes and H3-H4 tetramers, indicating its role in nucleosome recognition and chromatin interaction (Gerhold2012Structure).

## Interactions
ACTR8, a component of the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex, participates in several key interactions that facilitate its role in chromatin remodeling and gene regulation. Within the INO80 complex, ACTR8 is part of subcomplex 1, where it directly binds with the HSA domain of INO80. This subcomplex also includes proteins such as ACTB, ACTL6A, YY1, and YY1AP1, which together contribute to the complex's ability to interact with nucleosomes and facilitate chromatin remodeling (Huang2022Nuclear).

ACTR8 is involved in the ATPase activity of the INO80 complex, which is crucial for recruiting the complex to sites of DNA damage and for transcriptional activation by regulating promoter architecture (Choe2020A). The protein's interactions are essential for the complex's function in DNA replication, repair, and transcription regulation. In yeast, the homolog of ACTR8, Arp8, is known to be involved in nucleosome binding, suggesting a similar role for ACTR8 in humans (Huang2022Nuclear).

The study of ACTR8's interactions within the INO80 complex highlights its importance in maintaining chromatin structure and facilitating various cellular processes, including gene expression and DNA repair (Sardiu2014Conserved).
