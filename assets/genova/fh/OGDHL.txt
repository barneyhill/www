# OGDHL

## Overview
The OGDHL gene encodes the oxoglutarate dehydrogenase L protein, a crucial component of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex involved in the Krebs cycle, which is essential for cellular energy production. This protein is categorized as a dehydrogenase and is structurally related to other enzymes in the 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase family. It plays a significant role in converting 2-oxoglutarate to succinyl-CoA within the mitochondria, thereby contributing to ATP generation and metabolic regulation (Lin2023Evaluating; Bunik2007Structure–function). OGDHL is predominantly expressed in the brain, indicating its importance in brain metabolism and potential involvement in neurotransmitter synthesis (Lin2023Evaluating). The protein also influences apoptosis and cell growth by modulating signaling pathways such as AKT and NF-kB, highlighting its broader role in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Sen2012OGDHL). Mutations in the OGDHL gene have been linked to various neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (Lin2023Evaluating).

## Structure
The OGDHL protein is a member of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase family and shares structural similarities with other dehydrogenases involved in the Krebs cycle. It is characterized by several conserved domains, including the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase N-terminal domain, and three α/β domains: α/β1, which is involved in Thiamine diphosphate (ThDP) binding, α/β2, which binds transketolase and pyrimidine, and α/β3 (Lin2023Evaluating). These domains are highly conserved between humans and zebrafish, with the α/β1 and α/β2 domains sharing over 90% identity (Lin2023Evaluating).

The protein's structure includes essential residues for interactions with ThDP and core catalytic residues typical of 2-oxo acid dehydrogenases. The substrate-specific regions, particularly those interacting with the lipoyl-bearing domain, are conserved within OGDHL and related proteins (Bunik2007Structure–function). The secondary structure elements also show significant conservation, suggesting a preserved catalytic mechanism (Bunik2007Structure–function).

OGDHL is suggested to be an isoform of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (E1o), maintaining structural features associated with substrate specificity and calcium dependence, although it may have a modified affinity for the E3 component of the enzyme complex (Bunik2007Structure–function). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which could affect its enzymatic activity and stability. Splice variants of OGDHL can result in different isoforms, potentially influencing its function (Leandro2020DHTKD1).

## Function
The OGDHL gene encodes a protein that is part of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, which plays a crucial role in the Krebs cycle, a key metabolic pathway for energy production in cells. This enzyme complex catalyzes the conversion of 2-oxoglutarate to succinyl-CoA, contributing to ATP generation and metabolic regulation within the mitochondria (Lin2023Evaluating; Bunik2007Structure–function). OGDHL is structurally and functionally related to other enzymes in the 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase family, such as DHTKD1 and OGDH, and is involved in the 2-oxoglutarate/2-oxoadipate metabolic pathway (Sherrill2018Whole-exome; Bunik2007Structure–function).

In healthy human cells, OGDHL is believed to localize to the mitochondria, where it plays a role in energy production and cellular homeostasis (Sherrill2018Whole-exome; Bunik2007Structure–function). It is predominantly expressed in the brain, suggesting a specific role in brain metabolism, potentially regulating the distribution of 2-oxoglutarate for energy production or neurotransmitter synthesis (Lin2023Evaluating). The protein's involvement in modulating apoptosis, cell growth, and NF-kB signaling pathways further underscores its importance in maintaining cellular function (Sen2012OGDHL).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the OGDHL gene have been associated with a range of neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders. These include developmental delay, intellectual disability, movement disorders, seizures, dysmorphism, and hearing and vision impairments. The clinical presentation of these disorders is highly variable, with significant phenotypic heterogeneity observed among individuals with biallelic OGDHL variants (Lin2023Evaluating). 

The gene's role in mitochondrial function links it to conditions such as eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), where mutations in OGDHL can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, reduced ATP production, and increased reactive oxygen species production. These changes may exacerbate Th2 cytokine responses, contributing to the pathogenesis of EoE (Sherrill2018Whole-exome).

OGDHL variants have also been implicated in depressive disorders, particularly in certain populations. The rs2293239 variant, for example, is associated with increased glutamate levels, which are linked to depressive symptoms. This variant is more common in Asian populations and may contribute to familial depressive disorders by impairing glutamate metabolism (Pan2022OGDHL).

The complexity of OGDHL-related disorders is further highlighted by the presence of hypomorphic alleles and genetic compensation mechanisms, where related genes like OGDH can mitigate the effects of OGDHL loss (Lin2023Evaluating).

## Interactions
OGDHL is involved in several protein interactions, particularly within the oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDHC). It interacts with other components of this complex, such as dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase (DLST) and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD), facilitating energy metabolism (Bunik2007Structure–function). OGDHL is structurally similar to the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (E1o) and retains the ability to bind coenzymes and catalyze reactions, although it may have a modified affinity for the E3 component of the complex, dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (Bunik2007Structure–function).

In addition to its role in the OGDHC, OGDHL has been shown to modulate signaling pathways. It interacts with the AKT signaling pathway, where its overexpression leads to decreased AKT protein levels through increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and caspase 3 activation (Sen2012OGDHL). OGDHL also affects NF-kB function by reducing its nuclear translocation and DNA-binding activity, thereby decreasing NF-kB-dependent gene transcription (Sen2012OGDHL). These interactions suggest that OGDHL plays a role in regulating cell survival and apoptosis through its effects on AKT and NF-kB pathways.
