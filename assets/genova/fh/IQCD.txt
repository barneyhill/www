# IQCD

## Overview
The IQCD gene encodes the IQ motif containing D protein, which is a member of the IQ motif-containing protein family. This protein is characterized by its ability to bind calmodulin, a calcium-binding messenger protein, suggesting its involvement in calcium-dependent signaling pathways. The IQCD protein is primarily expressed in the testis, particularly during the late stages of spermiogenesis, and is localized in the acrosome and tail regions of mature spermatozoa. It plays a crucial role in the acrosome reaction and fertilization processes, indicating its importance in male fertility. Additionally, IQCD is part of the dynein regulatory complex, implicating it in broader cellular motility functions, including the regulation of motile cilia. The protein's interactions with other proteins, such as Munc13 and retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRα), further highlight its multifaceted role in cellular processes (Kim2017Characterization; Patir2020The; Zhang2019Corrigendum).

## Structure
The IQCD protein is characterized by the presence of a C-terminal conserved IQ motif domain and two coiled-coil domains. The IQ motif, located at amino acid residues 399-421 in humans, is known for binding to calmodulin, which regulates various calcium-dependent biological functions (Zhang2019Corrigendum; Zhang2019IQ). The coiled-coil domains are found at residues 89-125 and 212-384, contributing to the protein's structural stability and potential for protein-protein interactions (Zhang2019IQ).

The IQCD protein is highly conserved across several species, including humans, mice, rats, bovines, and macaques, indicating its evolutionary importance (Zhang2019Corrigendum). It is expressed predominantly in the testis, particularly in round and elongating spermatids during the late stage of spermiogenesis, and is localized in the acrosome and tail regions of mature spermatozoa (Zhang2019Corrigendum; Zhang2019IQ).

While the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of the IQCD protein are not detailed in the available literature, its role in sperm function and fertilization is suggested by its localization and interaction with other proteins, such as Munc13 (Zhang2019Corrigendum). The potential for post-translational modifications or different isoforms is indicated by the presence of two bands in spermatozoa, approximately 50 and 40 kDa in size (Zhang2019Corrigendum).

## Function
The IQCD gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in the acrosome reaction and fertilization processes in human spermatozoa. The IQCD protein is localized in the acrosome and tail regions of sperm cells, indicating its involvement in critical steps of fertilization. It is associated with the acrosome reaction, a process essential for the penetration of the egg by the sperm, and is involved in sperm capacitation, as evidenced by its effect on tyrosine phosphorylation levels during this process (Zhang2019Corrigendum).

IQCD is part of the IQ motif-containing protein family, which is known to bind calmodulin and participate in calcium-dependent biological processes. This suggests that IQCD may influence calcium signaling pathways, which are crucial for various cellular functions (Zhang2019Corrigendum). The protein is expressed in the testis, particularly during the late stages of spermiogenesis, and accumulates in round and elongating spermatids, highlighting its role in sperm development (Zhang2019Corrigendum).

In addition to its role in fertilization, IQCD is part of the dynein regulatory complex, which is involved in the function of motile cilia, suggesting a broader role in cellular motility and function (Patir2020The).

## Clinical Significance
The IQ motif containing D (IQCD) gene has been implicated in male infertility, particularly in cases of total fertilization failure or low fertilization rates in in vitro fertilization (IVF) patients. Studies have shown that IQCD expression is notably low in spermatozoa from these patients, suggesting a potential link between reduced IQCD levels and impaired fertilization outcomes (Zhang2019Corrigendum). The gene is associated with the acrosome reaction, a critical process in fertilization, and its protein localizes to the acrosome and tail regions of spermatozoa. The presence of anti-IQCD antibodies has been shown to significantly inhibit IVF rates in mice, further indicating its importance in sperm fertilization (Zhang2019Corrigendum).

While the clinical significance of IQCD mutations is not fully understood, there is some evidence linking the gene to neurodegenerative diseases and neuroblastoma, although these associations require further investigation (Zhang2019Corrigendum). The gene's role in these conditions may be related to its involvement in calcium-dependent signaling pathways, as the IQ motif domain is known to bind calmodulin, influencing various biological processes (Zhang2019Corrigendum). Further research is needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which IQCD mutations or altered expression levels contribute to these diseases.

## Interactions
The IQ motif containing D (IQCD) protein is involved in several protein-protein interactions, playing a role in various cellular processes. IQCD interacts with the retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRα), acting as a coactivator of nuclear receptors. This interaction is particularly strong in the presence of 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA) and involves the C-terminal half of the IQCD protein, which includes the IQ motif. This interaction enhances the transactivation of RXRα in both homodimeric and heterodimeric contexts with other nuclear receptors such as RARα, PPARγ, and SnPPAR (Kim2017Characterization).

In human spermatozoa, IQCD interacts with Munc13, a protein involved in the acrosome reaction and fertilization. This interaction was confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation analysis, and both proteins are colocalized in the acrosome region of the sperm head (Zhang2019Corrigendum). IQCD is also associated with the dynein regulatory complex, indicating a role in ciliary function (Dougherty2020CFAP45). These interactions suggest that IQCD is involved in calcium signaling pathways and may mediate crosstalk between retinoic acid receptors and calcium-sensing proteins (Kim2017Characterization).
