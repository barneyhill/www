# MYH15

## Overview
MYH15 is a gene that encodes the myosin heavy chain 15 protein, a member of the nonmuscle myosin II subgroup within the myosin superfamily. This protein is characterized by its structural resemblance to cardiac beta or slow skeletal type 1 myosin heavy chains, featuring a coiled-coil rod domain essential for dimerization and protein interactions (Neary2014Myosin). Myosin heavy chain 15 is expressed in a variety of tissues, including extraocular muscles, the heart, and the brain, suggesting its involvement in diverse physiological roles (Schiaffino2018Muscle; Neary2014Myosin). Functionally, MYH15 is implicated in muscle contraction and cellular movement, with a notable presence in specialized muscles and non-muscle tissues, indicating a broader role beyond traditional muscle functions (Lee2019The). The gene's polymorphisms and expression patterns have been linked to various cardiovascular and respiratory conditions, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Neary2014Myosin; Chen2019Association).

## Structure
The MYH15 gene encodes a protein that is part of the nonmuscle myosin II subgroup of the myosin superfamily. Structurally, the MYH15 protein resembles a cardiac beta or slow skeletal type 1 myosin heavy chain, featuring a coiled-coil rod domain (Neary2014Myosin). This domain is crucial for dimerization and interaction with other proteins. The MYH15 protein is expressed in various tissues, including extraocular muscles, the heart, and the brain, indicating its diverse functional roles (Schiaffino2018Muscle; Neary2014Myosin).

A notable feature of the MYH15 protein is the presence of a polymorphism, rs3900940, which results in an amino acid substitution from threonine to alanine at position 1125 in the coiled-coil rod domain. This substitution affects the protein's ability to undergo phosphorylation, potentially altering its structure and function (Neary2014Myosin). The MYH15 gene is subject to epigenetic regulation, with expression levels influenced by hypoxic conditions, which may affect its structural and functional properties (Neary2014Myosin). The evolutionary analysis suggests that MYH15 is an ancient sarcomeric myosin, with a divergence time older than MYH14, indicating its long-standing role in muscle function (Ikeda2007Divergent).

## Function
MYH15 encodes a myosin heavy chain protein that is involved in muscle contraction and cellular movement. In humans, MYH15 is expressed in specialized muscles, such as extraocular muscles and muscle spindles, which are responsible for precise and rapid movements (Schiaffino2018Muscle; Lee2019The). Unlike typical sarcomeric myosins, MYH15 is also found in non-muscle tissues, including several brain regions, the testis, and the pituitary gland, suggesting a role beyond traditional muscle contraction (Lee2019The).

MYH15 is associated with a slow ATPase activity, which may influence muscle spindle signaling, potentially affecting proprioception and muscle coordination (Lee2019The). The protein is also present in the pulmonary vascular epithelium and alveolar macrophages, indicating a possible role in the pulmonary vascular system and immune response (Chen2019Association; Lee2019The). MYH15's expression pattern and its involvement in various tissues suggest it may retain a contractile or motile role outside of muscle cells, contributing to diverse cellular functions and organismal outcomes (Lee2019The). The specific function of MYH15 in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated, but its presence in specialized tissues highlights its potential importance in muscle and non-muscle functions (Lee2019The).

## Clinical Significance
The MYH15 gene has been implicated in several cardiovascular and respiratory conditions due to its polymorphisms and altered expression levels. In humans, MYH15 polymorphisms have been associated with a decreased risk of coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and strokes. The T allele of the rs29016420 SNP, in particular, is linked to a reduced risk of these conditions, suggesting a protective role (Neary2014Myosin).

In cattle, the MYH15 gene is associated with pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), particularly under hypoxic conditions. The T allele of MYH15 is linked to lower PAP, which is significant in high-altitude environments where hypoxia is prevalent. This allele is prevalent in yaks, which are adapted to high altitudes, indicating a potential role in adaptation to such environments (Neary2014Myosin).

In the context of respiratory diseases, MYH15 polymorphisms have been studied for their association with asthma susceptibility in the Chinese Han population. Certain alleles, such as the A allele of rs9288876 and the G alleles of rs7635009 and rs1454197, have been found to have protective effects against asthma, although these findings were not statistically significant after correction for multiple comparisons (Chen2019Association).

## Interactions
The MYH15 gene, encoding myosin heavy chain 15, is involved in several interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of modulating dipeptide-mediated toxicity. MYH15 has been shown to interact with dipeptide repeat proteins, specifically proline-arginine (PR) and glycine-arginine (GR), which are associated with neuronal toxicity in conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In a Drosophila model, the knockdown of the MYH15 ortholog, Mhc, enhanced retinal toxicity when crossed with lines expressing PR and GR repeats, suggesting that MYH15 may modulate PR aggregate-mediated toxicity through impairment of vesicle trafficking (Kim2019Rare).

MYH15 also interacts with other myosin heavy chain proteins, such as MYH9 and MYH10, indicating its potential role in vesicle trafficking and cytoskeleton remodeling. These interactions highlight the structural uniqueness of MYH15 compared to classical myosin heavy chain genes, which may contribute to its specific functions (Kim2019Rare). Despite these findings, specific interactions of MYH15 with nucleic acids or its involvement in multiprotein complexes are not detailed in the available literature.
