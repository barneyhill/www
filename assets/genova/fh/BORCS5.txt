# BORCS5

## Overview
BORCS5 is a gene that encodes the protein BLOC-1 related complex subunit 5, also known as myrlysin. This protein is a critical component of the BORC (BLOC-1-related complex), which is involved in the regulation of lysosomal positioning and movement within cells. The BORC complex, including BORCS5, plays a significant role in the transport of lysosomes along microtubules, facilitating their movement towards the cell periphery. This process is essential for the fusion of lysosomes with autophagosomes, a key step in autophagy, which is crucial for cellular homeostasis and the degradation of cellular components. BORCS5 interacts with various proteins, such as ARL8A and ARL8B, to mediate these processes, and its dysfunction has been linked to several clinical conditions, including cancer and autoimmune diseases (Mishra2023Endosome; Jia2017BORC).

## Function
BORCS5 is a component of the BORC complex, which plays a crucial role in lysosome positioning and autophagy in human cells. The BORC complex, including BORCS5, is involved in the regulation of lysosomal transport along microtubules, facilitating the movement of lysosomes toward the cell periphery. This movement is essential for the encounter and fusion of lysosomes with autophagosomes, a critical step in the autophagic process (Jia2017BORC).

BORCS5 contributes to the recruitment of ARL8A and ARL8B to lysosomes, which in turn recruit kinesins and the HOPS complex. These interactions enable the centrifugal transport of lysosomes, promoting their encounter with peripheral autophagosomes and facilitating autophagosome-lysosome fusion (Jia2017BORC). The BORC complex also supports the assembly of the STX17-VAMP8-SNAP29 trans-SNARE complex, essential for efficient autophagosome-lysosome fusion (Jia2017BORC).

In BORCS5 knockout cells, there is impaired recruitment of the HOPS complex to lysosomes, leading to defects in autophagosome-lysosome fusion and increased accumulation of autophagy markers like LC3B-II (Jia2017BORC). This highlights BORCS5's role in maintaining autophagic flux and cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
BORCS5, also known as BLOC-1 related complex subunit 5, has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in cellular processes. Alterations in BORCS5 expression or function can contribute to the progression of Ewing sarcoma, particularly at relapse. The LMO3-BORCS5 fusion oncogene, identified in Ewing sarcoma, is associated with increased tumor proliferation and resistance to certain anticancer drugs, such as vincristine and SN-38. This fusion results in a frameshift in BORCS5, leading to the formation of new amino acids and potentially disrupting its normal tumor-suppressor functions (Dupain2019Newly).

BORCS5 is also involved in immune signaling pathways. Its deficiency can lead to enhanced Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) signaling, which is associated with autoimmune diseases like lupus. This is due to impaired lysosomal fusion and turnover of TLR7, resulting in its accumulation and hyperactivity (Mishra2023Endosome).

In the context of autophagy, BORCS5 is crucial for the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. Knockout of BORCS5 leads to impaired autophagic flux, which can contribute to diseases characterized by autophagic dysregulation, such as neurodegenerative disorders (Jia2017BORC).

## Interactions
BORCS5, also known as myrlysin, is a subunit of the BORC complex, which plays a crucial role in lysosome positioning and movement. BORCS5 interacts with several proteins within the BORC complex, including KXD1 and SNAPIN, facilitating the recruitment of ARL8A and ARL8B to lysosomes. This recruitment is essential for the movement of lysosomes along microtubules via kinesin motors, specifically kinesins 1 and 3 (De2024Messenger; Jia2017BORC).

BORCS5 is also involved in the recruitment of the HOPS complex to lysosomes, which is critical for autophagosome-lysosome fusion. In BORCS5 knockout cells, there is a notable reduction in the lysosomal localization of HOPS components such as VPS41 and ARL8B, indicating BORCS5's role in their proper localization (Jia2017BORC). Additionally, BORCS5 participates in the assembly of the STX17-VAMP8-SNAP29 trans-SNARE complex, which is essential for autophagosome-lysosome fusion (Jia2017BORC).

The BORC complex, including BORCS5, interacts with the small GTPase ARL8B, which is crucial for the regulation of lysosomal transport and positioning. This interaction is part of a broader network that includes the HOPS complex and other proteins involved in lysosomal fusion and transport processes (Mishra2023Endosome).
