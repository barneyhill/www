# ANXA4

## Overview
ANXA4 is a gene that encodes the protein annexin A4, a member of the annexin family known for its calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding properties. Annexin A4 is categorized as a membrane-associated protein and plays a significant role in cellular processes such as membrane repair and vesiculation. The protein is characterized by a conserved core domain with four annexin repeats, which facilitate its interaction with anionic membranes upon calcium activation (Mularski2021Simultaneous; Gerke2024Annexins—a). ANXA4 is involved in various cellular functions, including the induction of membrane curvature and fusion events essential for plasma membrane repair (Boye2018Annexins). It also participates in protein interactions that influence cell proliferation, apoptosis, and drug resistance, particularly in cancer contexts (Liu2020p53; Zhang2023Annexin). Alterations in ANXA4 expression have been linked to several diseases, including cancer and recurrent spontaneous abortion, highlighting its clinical significance (Ye2024Whole; Choi2016Prognostic).

## Structure
Annexin A4 (ANXA4) is a member of the annexin family, characterized by its ability to bind phospholipids in a calcium-dependent manner. The protein consists of a conserved core domain with four annexin repeats, each forming a helix-loop-helix motif, contributing to its secondary and tertiary structure (Gerke2024Annexins—a). The annexin core is primarily composed of Ca2+/membrane-binding motifs, which include two antiparallel alpha-helices connected by short loop-forming polypeptides, known as type II Ca2+ sites. These sites are distinct from the classical type I (EF hand) fold and are exemplified in the AnxA5 structure (Gerke2024Annexins—a).

The core domain of ANXA4 is highly conserved among annexins and has a slightly curved disc shape with membrane attachment sites on the convex side (Mularski2021Simultaneous). The N-terminal region is variable and provides differential function and binding modes (Mularski2021Simultaneous). ANXA4 can self-assemble into trimers on membrane surfaces, restricting the mobility of phospholipids and other proteins during repair (Mularski2021Simultaneous). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, influencing its function and interactions. Splice variant isoforms can result in structural and functional diversity (Gerke2024Annexins—a).

## Function
Annexin A4 (ANXA4) is a member of the annexin protein family, which is known for its ability to bind anionic membranes in response to calcium activation. ANXA4 plays a crucial role in cellular functions such as membrane repair and vesiculation. It is involved in inducing membrane curvature and facilitating membrane fusion events, which are essential for the repair of plasma membranes. Upon membrane injury, ANXA4 translocates to the vicinity of membrane wound edges, where it induces curvature and a constriction force that helps pull the wound edges together for eventual fusion (Boye2018Annexins; Boye2017Annexin).

ANXA4 is unique in its ability to self-associate into crosslinked trimers, hexamers, and larger aggregates in a calcium-dependent manner on membranes or vesicles with negatively charged phospholipids. This self-association allows ANXA4 to induce curvature on phosphatidylserine-containing membranes, eventually rolling up whole membrane patches (Boye2018Annexins). The protein's ability to form trimers is essential for its function in membrane repair, as mutants deficient in trimer formation fail to repair membrane damage effectively (Boye2017Annexin).

ANXA4 is also involved in the rapid closure of micron-sized holes in the plasma membrane, counteracting various plasma membrane disruptions and indicating its role in early events of cell membrane repair (Boye2017Annexin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the ANXA4 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In cancer, ANXA4 is frequently overexpressed and associated with tumor proliferation, chemoresistance, and poor prognosis. It is notably upregulated in ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC), where it interacts with NF-κB p50 to promote cell cycle progression and inhibit apoptosis, contributing to the malignancy of OCCC (Liu2020p53). ANXA4 is also linked to chemoresistance in cervical cancer, where high expression correlates with poor disease-free and overall survival (Choi2016Prognostic).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, ANXA4 overexpression promotes proliferation through pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin and PI3K/AKT-HIF-α, while its downregulation can inhibit tumor growth (Zhang2023Annexin). ANXA4 is also implicated in recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) due to a novel mutation, p.G8D, which affects cell migration and adhesion, potentially leading to implantation failure (Ye2024Whole).

ANXA4's role in cancer extends to its involvement in immune cell infiltration and its potential impact on immunotherapy efficacy, as seen in its correlation with tumor mutational burden and microsatellite instability across various cancer types (Yan2021PanCancer).

## Interactions
Annexin A4 (ANXA4) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In the context of ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC), ANXA4 interacts with NF-κB p50, forming complexes that regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis. This interaction promotes the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, leading to increased expression of cyclin D1 and Bcl-2, which are associated with cell cycle progression and inhibition of apoptosis (Liu2020p53). ANXA4 also interacts with wild-type p53, which positively regulates its expression by binding to the transcription initiation site of the ANXA4 gene (Liu2020p53).

In lung cancer, ANXA4 forms a complex with the Fhit protein, a tumor suppressor, contributing to drug resistance by preventing Fhit's cytoplasmic translocation (Zhang2023Annexin). ANXA4 also interacts with ATP7A, and targeting this interaction can sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy (Zhang2023Annexin).

In the context of preeclampsia, ANXA4 interacts with the PI3K/AKT/eNOS signaling pathway, promoting trophoblast invasion and proliferation while inhibiting apoptosis. This interaction is crucial for regulating trophoblast behavior and may have therapeutic implications (Xu2019ANXA4).
