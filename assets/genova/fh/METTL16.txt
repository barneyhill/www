# METTL16

## Overview
METTL16 is a gene that encodes the protein methyltransferase 16, RNA N6-adenosine, which is a member of the RNA methyltransferase family. This protein is primarily involved in the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of RNA, a critical post-transcriptional modification that influences RNA stability, splicing, and processing. METTL16 is characterized by its distinct structural domains, including an N-terminal RNA-binding domain, a methyltransferase domain, and a C-terminal vertebrate conserved region (VCR), which collectively facilitate its interaction with RNA substrates and other proteins (Mansfield2024RNA; Satterwhite2021RNA). The protein plays a significant role in regulating S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) homeostasis, a key methyl donor in cellular methylation reactions, and is involved in the splicing and stability of MAT2A mRNA and U6 snRNA (Mermoud2022The; Satterwhite2021RNA). METTL16's activity is modulated by its structural features, such as the auto-regulatory K-loop, which influences its function as a methyl sensor (Mermoud2022The). The gene and its encoded protein have been implicated in various cancers, where they can act as either oncogenes or tumor suppressors, depending on the cancer type and context (Lu2022METTL16; Wang2021METTL16).

## Structure
The METTL16 protein is a conserved RNA methyltransferase involved in N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification. It features several distinct domains, including an N-terminal RNA-binding domain, a methyltransferase domain, and a C-terminal vertebrate conserved region (VCR) (Mansfield2024RNA; Satterwhite2021RNA). The N-terminal domain contains a positively charged groove formed by lysines and arginines, which interacts with the RNA phosphate backbone, stabilizing RNA for methylation (Mansfield2024RNA). This domain acts as a 'claw' to stabilize RNA in the methyltransferase groove (Satterwhite2021RNA).

The methyltransferase domain of METTL16 is characterized by a Rossmann-like fold typical of class I methyltransferases, featuring a hydrophobic pocket and hydrogen bonds for S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) binding. It includes an 'NPPF' sequence crucial for stabilizing the methionine region and facilitating methyl group transfer (Satterwhite2021RNA). Unique to METTL16 is the 'auto-regulatory K-loop', which reduces methylation efficiency by obstructing the SAM binding pocket, potentially regulating METTL16's activity as a methyl sensor (Mermoud2022The; Satterwhite2021RNA).

The C-terminal VCR domain, composed of VCR1 and VCR2, enhances RNA binding and methylation activity. It is structurally homologous to the KA1 domain found in other proteins and interacts with the internal stem-loop of U6 snRNA, facilitating m6A modification (Aoyama2020Mechanistic; Mansfield2024RNA). The VCR domain's arginine-rich regions are critical for RNA binding and methylation activity (Aoyama2020Mechanistic). METTL16 functions as a monomer and has not been fully crystallized, though fragment structures have been published (Satterwhite2021RNA).

## Function
METTL16 is an RNA methyltransferase that plays a crucial role in the methylation of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) on RNA, which is essential for RNA processing, splicing, and stability in healthy human cells (Satterwhite2021RNA). It is involved in the regulation of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) homeostasis, a key methyl donor for various methylation reactions, including those involving DNA, RNA, and proteins (Mermoud2022The; Satterwhite2021RNA). METTL16 regulates the splicing and stability of MAT2A mRNA, which encodes a subunit of methionine adenosyltransferase 2, the enzyme responsible for SAM synthesis. When SAM levels are sufficient, METTL16 methylates adenosines in the 3' UTR of MAT2A mRNA, leading to intron retention and mRNA degradation. Conversely, low SAM levels result in enhanced splicing and increased MAT2A mRNA stability, thus promoting SAM production (Mermoud2022The; Satterwhite2021RNA).

METTL16 also interacts with U6 snRNA, facilitating its m6A methylation, which is important for intron splicing (Satterwhite2021RNA). It functions in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments, participating in RNA biogenesis, decay, and translational control (Mermoud2022The). METTL16's activity is modulated by the RNA transition region and an autoregulatory K-loop, which are crucial for maintaining appropriate physiological levels of SAM (Doxtader2018Structural).

## Clinical Significance
METTL16, an m6A methyltransferase, plays a complex role in various cancers, with its expression levels and mutations significantly impacting clinical outcomes. In gastric cancer, METTL16 is highly expressed and associated with larger tumor size and lymph node metastasis, serving as a negative prognostic marker. It promotes cell proliferation by upregulating cyclin D1 expression, and its knockdown results in reduced tumor growth (Wang2021METTL16). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), METTL16 is upregulated and linked to poor prognosis. It enhances cancer progression by promoting proliferation and invasion while inhibiting apoptosis, partly through the m6A modification of the lncRNA RAB11B-AS1 (Dai2022METTL16).

Conversely, in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), METTL16 is underexpressed and acts as a tumor suppressor. Higher expression correlates with better overall survival and disease-free survival, particularly in the classical subtype of PDA. It is also associated with enhanced antitumor immunity, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Lu2022METTL16). These findings highlight METTL16's dual role in cancer, acting as either an oncogene or tumor suppressor depending on the cancer type and context.

## Interactions
METTL16 is an RNA methyltransferase that interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in RNA processing and splicing. It primarily binds to U6 snRNA, where it facilitates the methylation of adenosine at position 43, a modification crucial for pre-mRNA splicing (Aoyama2020Mechanistic). The protein's interaction with U6 snRNA is mediated by its C-terminal vertebrate conserved region (VCR), which is structurally similar to the KA1 domain of TUT1, known for RNA-binding activity (Aoyama2020Mechanistic; Ruszkowska2021METTL16).

METTL16 also interacts with MAT2A mRNA, influencing its splicing and stability, which is essential for regulating S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) homeostasis (Ruszkowska2021METTL16). The protein forms RNA-dependent interactions with proteins involved in U6 snRNA biogenesis, such as MEPCE, the La protein, and LARP7, which stabilize a pre-U6 snRNA form that interacts with METTL16 (Ruszkowska2021METTL16).

In addition to these interactions, METTL16 binds to the MALAT1 RNA triple helix, although the monomeric form of METTL16 does not bind to this structure, indicating that dimerization is necessary for this interaction (Ruszkowska2018Structural). These interactions highlight METTL16's role in RNA methylation and its involvement in various RNA processing pathways.
