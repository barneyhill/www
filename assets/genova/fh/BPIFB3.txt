# BPIFB3

## Overview
BPIFB3 is a gene that encodes the protein BPI fold containing family B member 3, which is part of the BPI fold-containing family characterized by a lipid-binding domain. The BPIFB3 protein is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plays a crucial role in regulating autophagy, a cellular process involved in the degradation and recycling of cellular components. It is involved in a non-canonical form of autophagy, influencing the formation and maturation of autophagosomes and amphisomes, and affects the morphology of endosomes and lysosomes. BPIFB3's interactions within the ER, particularly with the antiviral regulator RETREG1, are significant for its role in modulating ER dynamics and facilitating flavivirus infection. The protein's function in maintaining ER structure and modulating autophagic pathways suggests its importance in cellular homeostasis and responses to stress and viral infections (Evans2018BPIFB3; DelormeAxford2014BPIFB3).

## Structure
The BPIFB3 protein is part of the BPI fold-containing family, which is characterized by a lipid-binding domain. Although the exact molecular structure of BPIFB3 has not been fully elucidated, it is suggested to have a boomerang shape similar to that of the BPI protein, which includes two hydrophobic lipid-binding pockets in each fold (DelormeAxford2014BPIFB3). BPIFB3 consists of two large BPI folds, known as BPI-1 and BPI-2. The first BPI fold (BPI-1) is particularly significant as it localizes with LC3B puncta and induces LC3B vacuoles, indicating its role in autophagy regulation (DelormeAxford2014BPIFB3).

BPIFB3 is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and contains a KDEL sequence at the N-terminus, which is typically involved in ER retention. However, mutation of this sequence does not affect its ER localization (DelormeAxford2014BPIFB3). The protein's topology within the ER has been studied, revealing that the C-terminal domain is in the cytosol, while an internal region is within the ER lumen (DelormeAxford2014BPIFB3). Specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of BPIFB3 are not provided in the available literature.

## Function
BPIFB3 is a protein localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plays a significant role in regulating autophagy, a cellular process involved in the degradation and recycling of cellular components. It is involved in a non-canonical form of autophagy, influencing the formation and maturation of autophagosomes (APs) and amphisomes (Evans2018BPIFB3; DelormeAxford2014BPIFB3). BPIFB3 silencing enhances autophagy by increasing the size of autophagosomes and amphisomes, although these structures are nondegradative, suggesting an inhibition of autophagic flux (DelormeAxford2014BPIFB3). 

BPIFB3 also affects the endosomal pathway, leading to changes in the morphology of early and late endosomes and lysosomes (DelormeAxford2014BPIFB3). It is associated with the ER and influences ER sheet morphology and turnover through an autophagy-associated pathway, stabilizing ER sheets and potentially regulating reticulophagy (Evans2018BPIFB3). The protein's localization to the ER and its involvement in vesicle trafficking suggest a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and membrane architecture (Evans2018BPIFB3). BPIFB3's function in healthy human cells may include modulating autophagic pathways and maintaining ER structure, which could impact cellular responses to stress and viral infections (DelormeAxford2014BPIFB3).

## Interactions
BPIFB3 is involved in interactions within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that are crucial for its role in regulating reticulophagy and facilitating flavivirus infection. BPIFB3 colocalizes with RETREG1, an antiviral regulator, within the ER. This colocalization occurs independently of RETREG1's function in reticulophagy, as shown by experiments using an autophagy-deficient mutant of RETREG1 (Evans2018BPIFB3). Although direct interaction between BPIFB3 and RETREG1 was not confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation due to low protein solubility, a modified reversible bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay indicated that BPIFB3 and RETREG1 are in close proximity, less than 10 nm apart, within the ER sheets (Evans2018BPIFB3).

BPIFB3's interaction with RETREG1 is significant in the context of flavivirus replication. BPIFB3 negatively regulates RETREG1-mediated reticulophagy, which is essential for maintaining ER membrane availability for viral replication. Silencing BPIFB3 enhances reticulophagy, reducing ER membrane availability and inhibiting flavivirus replication, an effect that is reversed by co-depletion of RETREG1 (Evans2018BPIFB3). These interactions highlight BPIFB3's role in modulating ER dynamics and its potential impact on viral lifecycle processes.
