# ITGA4

## Overview
The ITGA4 gene encodes the integrin subunit alpha 4, a transmembrane protein that is a critical component of the integrin family, which plays a pivotal role in cell adhesion and signaling processes. Integrin alpha 4 forms heterodimers with beta subunits, such as β1 and β7, to create functional integrin receptors like α4β1 and α4β7. These receptors are integral to mediating interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix, influencing cellular activities such as migration, differentiation, and immune response. The α4β1 integrin, in particular, is essential for immune cell trafficking, facilitating the migration of T cells to sites of inflammation through interactions with vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) (AungHtut2019Reduction; Byron2012Proteomic). The ITGA4 gene's expression and function have significant clinical implications, particularly in diseases such as multiple sclerosis and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, where it serves as a therapeutic target and a prognostic marker (Attia2020ITGA4; Ahmed2023Integrin).

## Structure
The ITGA4 gene encodes the integrin alpha 4 subunit, a component of the integrin family involved in cell adhesion and signaling. The primary structure of ITGA4 consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by 28 exons, with the extracellular domain encoded by exons 1-26, the transmembrane domain by exon 27, and the cytoplasmic domain by exon 28 (AungHtut2019Reduction). The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a three-dimensional shape, often stabilized by disulfide bonds. 

In terms of quaternary structure, ITGA4 forms heterodimers with beta subunits, such as β1 or β7, to create functional integrin receptors like α4β1, which are crucial for cell adhesion and migration (Byron2012Proteomic). The protein contains specific domains, including the I-domain, which is essential for ligand binding. Common post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, affect the protein's stability and function. Splice variant isoforms of ITGA4 can result in structural and functional diversity, potentially altering its role in cellular processes (AungHtut2019Reduction).

## Function
The ITGA4 gene encodes the integrin alpha 4 subunit, which is a crucial component of integrin receptors involved in cell adhesion and signaling. In healthy human cells, ITGA4 pairs with the β1 chain to form the α4β1 integrin, also known as very late antigen 4 (VLA-4), or with the β7 chain to form the α4β7 integrin. These integrins are essential for mediating cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions, influencing cell morphology, migration, differentiation, and tissue integrity (AungHtut2019Reduction; Byron2012Proteomic).

The α4β1 integrin is prominently expressed on T cells and plays a significant role in immune cell trafficking and inflammation by facilitating T cell migration to tissues. This is achieved through interactions with the vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) on endothelial cells, which is crucial for T-cell migration across the endothelial barrier into lymph nodes or inflamed tissues (AungHtut2019Reduction; Hogg2003Tcell). The α4 integrin subunit is involved in a distinct cell motility signaling pathway and is associated with the recruitment of specific proteins to adhesion complexes, which are important for cell adhesion and signaling (Byron2012Proteomic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ITGA4 gene, which encodes the integrin alpha 4 subunit, have significant clinical implications in various diseases. In multiple sclerosis (MS), ITGA4 is a target for the monoclonal antibody natalizumab, which is used to prevent immune cell migration into the central nervous system. However, genetic polymorphisms in ITGA4, such as the +3061 (G>A) mutation, have been associated with variable responses to natalizumab treatment. Patients with the AG genotype of this mutation are more likely to be non-responders, indicating a reduced therapeutic efficacy (Ahmed2023Integrin).

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), ITGA4 expression is linked to disease progression and prognosis. High expression levels of ITGA4, also known as CD49d, are associated with aggressive disease features and shorter time to treatment. This expression is regulated by methylation patterns, with specific CpG sites showing hypermethylation in CLL patients (Attia2020ITGA4).

In gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), ITGA4 is highly expressed and associated with adverse prognostic features, such as high mitotic count and metastatic disease, leading to poor survival outcomes (Pulkka2018Clinical).

## Interactions
Integrin alpha 4 (ITGA4) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cell adhesion and signaling. ITGA4 forms heterodimers with beta subunits such as ITGB1 and ITGB7, creating integrins like α4β1 (VLA-4) and α4β7 (LPAM-1). These integrins interact with ligands such as vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) and fibronectin, facilitating cell adhesion and migration (AungHtut2019Reduction; Byron2012Proteomic).

The α4β1 integrin specifically recruits proteins to adhesion complexes, with the α4 subunit playing a significant role in this recruitment. Proteins such as talin-1, filamin-C, and filamin-B are differentially recruited to these complexes, influencing cell migration and signaling processes (Byron2012Proteomic). The interaction network of these complexes includes core proteins like talin-1, moesin, and ARPC4, which are associated with integrin activation and cytoskeletal linkage (Byron2012Proteomic).

ITGA4 also interacts with ADAM2, a protein involved in cell adhesion, particularly in the context of sperm-egg interactions. ITGA4, in combination with ITGB7, mediates adhesion to ADAM2, highlighting its role in integrin-based adhesion processes (Desiderio2010ADAM2). These interactions underscore the importance of ITGA4 in various cellular functions and its potential as a therapeutic target.
