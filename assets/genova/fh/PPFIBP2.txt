# PPFIBP2

## Overview
PPFIBP2, or PPFIA binding protein 2, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the liprin family, which is involved in various cellular processes such as cell adhesion, signaling, and cytoskeletal organization. The protein, also known as liprin-beta2, plays a significant role in neuronal development and synaptic function by interacting with other liprin proteins and partners like CASK and RIMS1. It is predominantly expressed in the brain, suggesting its importance in neuronal activities (Wakamatsu2009Identification). PPFIBP2 is implicated in cancer biology, where it exhibits tumor suppressor properties, contrasting with the oncogenic roles of other liprin family members. Germline mutations in PPFIBP2 have been associated with aggressive prostate cancer, and the gene has been identified in a fusion oncogene with RET in thyroid cancers, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology (Pehkonen2021Liprins; Iyama2017Identification).

## Function
PPFIBP2, also known as PPFIA binding protein 2, is involved in several cellular processes, including cell adhesion and signaling. It interacts with liprin proteins, which are crucial for synaptic function and neuronal development. PPFIBP2 is active in the cytoplasm and at cell membranes, where it contributes to the organization of the cytoskeleton and intracellular transport (Wakamatsu2009Identification).

In healthy human cells, PPFIBP2 is expressed in the brain, indicating its potential role in neuronal activities (Wakamatsu2009Identification). The protein is part of the liprin family, which is known for its involvement in the assembly of large protein complexes that regulate synaptic signaling and assembly. These complexes are essential for maintaining proper neuronal functions and may also play a role in cancer cell motility and invasion (Pehkonen2021Liprins).

PPFIBP2 is considered to have tumor suppressor properties, contrasting with the oncogenic functions of other liprin family members like liprin-β1 (PPFIBP1). Germline loss-of-function mutations in PPFIBP2 have been linked to shorter survival in prostate cancer, suggesting its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and its potential as a biomarker in certain cancers (Pehkonen2021Liprins).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PPFIBP2 gene have been associated with lethal prostate cancer (PCa). A study by Wu et al. found that germline mutations in PPFIBP2 were significantly more frequent in patients with lethal PCa compared to those with low-risk localized PCa. Specifically, 1.52% of lethal PCa patients carried pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations in PPFIBP2, while only 0.12% of low-risk patients did. These mutations were linked to a higher risk of early death and shorter survival after diagnosis, suggesting that PPFIBP2 could serve as a prognostic marker for aggressive PCa (Wu2018Germline).

In thyroid cancer, particularly in young patients from Fukushima, a novel fusion oncogene involving PPFIBP2, known as PPFIBP2/RET, was identified. This fusion results from an interchromosomal translocation and retains the kinase domain of RET, which can activate the MAPK signaling pathway and promote cell growth. The PPFIBP2/RET fusion has been shown to have transforming potential, indicating its role as a driver oncogene in thyroid carcinogenesis (Iyama2017Identification). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PPFIBP2 mutations and alterations in cancer development and progression.

## Interactions
PPFIBP2, also known as liprin-beta2, is involved in various protein interactions that contribute to its role in cellular processes. It is part of the liprin family and interacts with liprin-α2 (PPFIA2) and other partners such as CASK and RIMS1, as facilitated by the R2SP complex. This interaction is crucial for organizing higher-order molecular assemblies and is involved in quaternary protein folding (Maurizy2018The).

PPFIBP2 has been implicated in axon guidance and neuronal synapse development by recruiting leukocyte common antigen-related (LAR) protein-tyrosine phosphatases to the plasma membrane. This suggests its involvement in diverse protein-protein interactions, particularly through its coiled-coil N-terminal domain and three Sterile Alpha Motif (SAM) domains at the C-terminal end (Wu2018Germline).

In the context of cancer, PPFIBP2 has been identified in a fusion oncogene with RET in thyroid cancers, known as PPFIBP2/RET. This fusion results from an interchromosomal translocation and retains the kinase domain of RET, which can activate the MAPK signaling pathway, promoting cell growth and transformation (Iyama2017Identification). These interactions highlight PPFIBP2's potential role in tumorigenesis and its involvement in critical signaling pathways.
