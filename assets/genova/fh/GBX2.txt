# GBX2

## Overview
The GBX2 gene encodes the gastrulation brain homeobox 2 protein, a homeodomain transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in embryonic development, particularly in the central nervous system. This protein is integral to the development of the anterior hindbrain, spinal cord, inner ear, heart, and neural crest cells, contributing to the segmentation of the hindbrain into rhombomeres, which are essential for forming distinct brain structures and neuronal populations (Roeseler2012Elongation; Wassarman1997Specification). As a transcriptional activator, GBX2 binds to specific DNA sequences, influencing the expression of target genes involved in various developmental processes, including those associated with Usher syndrome (Roeseler2012Elongation). The gene's function is conserved across vertebrates, and its disruption can lead to developmental defects akin to congenital diseases such as Usher syndrome and DiGeorge syndrome (Roeseler2012Elongation).

## Function
The GBX2 gene encodes a DNA-binding transcription factor that plays a crucial role in embryonic development, particularly in the formation of the central nervous system. It is involved in the development of the anterior hindbrain, spinal cord, inner ear, heart, and neural crest cells. GBX2 is essential for the patterning and growth of the midbrain and anterior hindbrain, especially in the segmentation of the hindbrain into rhombomeres, which give rise to distinct brain structures and neuronal populations (Roeseler2012Elongation; Wassarman1997Specification).

GBX2 functions as a transcriptional activator by binding to the core promoter sequence of target genes, such as EEF1A1, which is involved in protein translation. This binding occurs at a conserved promoter region that includes a TATA box, suggesting that GBX2 may enhance transcriptional activity by interacting with other transcriptional regulators (Roeseler2012Elongation).

In addition to its role in neural development, GBX2 is involved in the regulation of genes associated with Usher syndrome, impacting the formation and maintenance of stereocilia hair bundles in the inner ear, which are crucial for cochlear and vestibular function (Roeseler2012Elongation). The gene's function is conserved across vertebrate species, and its loss can lead to developmental defects similar to congenital diseases such as Usher syndrome and DiGeorge syndrome (Roeseler2012Elongation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the GBX2 gene are associated with several developmental disorders. GBX2 is crucial for the proper migration of neural crest cells and the development of the inner ear sensory organs. Loss of GBX2 function affects the Slit/Robo signaling pathway, leading to abnormal neural crest cell migration and conditions resembling congenital diseases like DiGeorge syndrome, which is characterized by congenital heart defects (Roeseler2012Elongation). GBX2 deficiency may contribute to developmental disorders by affecting neural crest cell migration and interaction with other genes, potentially leading to craniofacial malformations and cardiovascular defects (Roeseler2012Elongation).

GBX2 interacts with genes linked to Usher syndromes, such as PCDH15 and USH2A, which are crucial for the formation of stereocilia hair bundles in the inner ear. Mutations in these genes contribute to Usher syndrome types 1 and 2, characterized by cochlear and vestibular sensory defects (Roeseler2012Elongation). In mouse models, Gbx2-null embryos exhibit significant cardiovascular defects, including aberrant right subclavian artery and double-outlet right ventricle, which are similar to those observed in 22q11 deletion syndromes in humans (Byrd2005Loss; Stothard2020Pax9). These findings suggest that GBX2 plays a critical role in cardiovascular and craniofacial development, and its disruption can lead to significant congenital abnormalities.

## Interactions
GBX2 is a homeodomain transcription factor that primarily interacts with nucleic acids to regulate gene expression. It binds to AT-rich DNA motifs, which are characteristic of homeodomain transcription factors, and this interaction has been confirmed through techniques such as ChIP-Seq and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) (Roeseler2012Elongation). GBX2 directly binds to the core promoter of the EEF1A1 gene, overlapping with a putative TATA box, and acts as a transcriptional activator by increasing the transcriptional activity of the EEF1A1 reporter gene in co-transfection experiments (Roeseler2012Elongation).

GBX2 also interacts with the ROBO1 gene, a part of the Slit/Robo signaling pathway, which is crucial for neural crest cell migration and axonal guidance. This interaction was demonstrated by EMSA, showing that GBX2 binds to the ROBO1 target sequence (Roeseler2012Elongation). Additionally, GBX2 is involved in the regulation of genes associated with Usher syndrome, such as PCDH15 and USH2A, by binding to their intronic sequences, suggesting a role in modulating their expression (Roeseler2012Elongation).

GBX2's role in transcriptional regulation may also involve interactions with other proteins, such as the WD40 domain of Groucho/Tle corepressor proteins, through an Engrailed homology region 1 (eh-1) motif, to repress Otx expression (Roeseler2012Elongation).
