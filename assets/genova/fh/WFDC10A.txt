# WFDC10A

## Overview
WFDC10A is a gene that encodes the WAP four-disulfide core domain 10A protein, a member of the whey acidic protein (WAP) family characterized by a conserved four-disulfide core motif. This protein is primarily involved in the immune response and exhibits significant antimicrobial activity, particularly against gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli. The WFDC10A protein is cationic and hydrophilic, which facilitates its interaction with bacterial cell walls, leading to cell lysis while sparing mammalian cells. This selective antibacterial activity underscores its role in the innate immune defense system, particularly in the reproductive tract, where it helps protect male gametes from microbial infections (Shayu2006Differential). The structural integrity of the protein, maintained by its disulfide bonds, is crucial for its function, highlighting its potential importance in maintaining tissue homeostasis and defense mechanisms (Bingle2011Towards; Wen2024Versatile).

## Structure
The WFDC10A protein is part of the whey acidic protein (WAP) four-disulfide core domain family, characterized by a conserved domain structure. This domain typically consists of 40-50 amino acids with eight conserved cysteine residues that form four disulfide bonds, contributing to the protein's stability and function (Bingle2011Towards; Wen2024Versatile). The primary structure of WFDC10A includes a high content of basic amino acids, which imparts a cationic nature to the protein, as indicated by its isoelectric point (pI) values of 9.1 and 8.8 in human and monkey sequences, respectively (Shayu2006Differential).

The protein's molecular structure is characterized by its cationic and hydrophilic properties, which are essential for its antibacterial activity. The peptide derived from WFDC10A, known as P2, demonstrates significant antibacterial activity by permeabilizing bacterial cell walls, leading to cell lysis, while having minimal impact on eukaryotic cell membranes (Shayu2006Differential). The presence of disulfide bonds, typical of WFDC proteins, is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity necessary for its function (Shayu2006Differential). Specific details on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of WFDC10A are not provided in the available literature.

## Function
WFDC10A is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the WFDC domain family, characterized by a conserved four-disulfide core motif. This protein is involved in immune response and antimicrobial activities, playing a crucial role in the innate immune defense system. In the monkey epididymis, WFDC10A is highly expressed in the caput region, where it contributes to protecting male gametes from microbial infections. The protein exhibits antibacterial activity, particularly against gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, by permeabilizing the bacterial cell membrane without affecting mammalian cells. This suggests a specific targeting mechanism towards bacterial membranes, highlighting its role in maintaining tissue homeostasis and defense mechanisms in the reproductive tract (Shayu2006Differential).

The WFDC10A protein is cationic and hydrophilic, with a basic isoelectric point, which facilitates its interaction with bacterial cell walls. This interaction is crucial for its antimicrobial function, as it disrupts bacterial cell walls, leading to cell lysis (Shayu2006Differential). The protein's activity in extracellular spaces underscores its importance in the immune response and its potential role in protecting tissues from infections.
