# CYP2A6

## Overview
CYP2A6 is a gene that encodes the enzyme cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily A member 6, a crucial component of the cytochrome P450 superfamily. This enzyme is primarily involved in the oxidative metabolism of various xenobiotics and endogenous compounds, including the biotransformation of nicotine and several pharmaceutical agents. As a monooxygenase, CYP2A6 plays a significant role in drug metabolism and the detoxification of foreign chemicals in the liver and other tissues. The enzyme's activity is influenced by genetic polymorphisms, which can lead to significant interindividual variability in drug metabolism and response, impacting clinical outcomes and disease risk, particularly in relation to smoking behavior and cancer susceptibility (Di2009Structure; Tanner2017Variation).

## Structure
The CYP2A6 protein is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, characterized by a typical CYP fold. Its crystal structure reveals a compact, hydrophobic active site, which is notably small, with a volume of 260 Å³, making it the second smallest among human CYPs (Di2009Structure). This small active site is due to the repositioning of helix B' and helices F to H toward the active site, along with the presence of large aromatic residues that reduce the substrate binding site volume (Di2009Structure). The active site is well-suited for small, planar substrates, with Asn297 serving as a hydrogen bond donor to orient ligands like coumarin for regio-selective oxidation (Di2009Structure).

The tertiary structure of CYP2A6 is expected to be similar to that of bacterial CYP102 due to the similarity in redox partners, involving an NADPH-dependent flavoprotein reductase (Lewis1999Molecular). Unlike other mammalian CYPs, CYP2A6's helix I has an ideal secondary structural fold without a kink near the heme group, and no water molecule is found between the heme cofactor and helix I (Di2009Structure). The enzyme is monomeric, typical of the quaternary structure of cytochrome P450 enzymes.

## Function
The CYP2A6 gene encodes an enzyme that is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, primarily involved in the metabolism of various substances in the human body. In healthy human cells, CYP2A6 plays a crucial role in the metabolism of both exogenous and endogenous compounds. It is responsible for the C-oxidation of nicotine to nicotine 1'(5')-iminium ion, which is further metabolized to cotinine, contributing significantly to the systemic clearance of nicotine (Di2009Structure). This enzyme is also involved in the metabolism of several drugs, including the conversion of the prodrug tegafur to its active form, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and the metabolism of other therapeutic agents such as chlormethiazole and letrozole (Di2009Structure).

CYP2A6 is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, adrenal gland, testis, ovary, and breast, indicating its widespread role in metabolic processes across different organ systems (Di2009Structure). The enzyme's activity is subject to wide interindividual variation due to genetic polymorphisms, which can affect drug metabolism, clearance, and response, and have been linked to smoking behavior and lung cancer risk (Di2009Structure).

## Clinical Significance
The CYP2A6 gene is clinically significant due to its role in the metabolism of nicotine and various drugs, with genetic variations influencing disease risk and treatment outcomes. Variants in CYP2A6 can lead to altered nicotine metabolism, affecting smoking behavior and lung cancer risk. Individuals with reduced CYP2A6 activity tend to smoke less and have a lower risk of lung cancer due to decreased exposure to tobacco carcinogens (McDonagh2012PharmGKB; Tanner2017Variation). 

CYP2A6 polymorphisms also impact the metabolism of cancer therapeutics like tegafur and letrozole. Reduced CYP2A6 activity can lead to lower conversion of tegafur to its active form, 5-fluorouracil, potentially reducing treatment efficacy in cancer patients (McDonagh2012PharmGKB; Tanner2017Variation). In the case of letrozole, decreased CYP2A6 activity results in higher plasma concentrations, which may affect drug clearance and treatment outcomes (Tanner2017Variation).

Additionally, CYP2A6 variations influence the metabolism of drugs used in HIV and epilepsy treatment, such as efavirenz and valproic acid, respectively. These genetic differences can lead to altered drug plasma levels, affecting efficacy and the risk of adverse effects (McDonagh2012PharmGKB; Tanner2017Variation).
