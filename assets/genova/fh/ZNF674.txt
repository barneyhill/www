# ZNF674

## Overview
ZNF674 is a gene located on the X chromosome, specifically in the Xp11.3-p11.23 region, and encodes the zinc finger protein 674, a member of the Kruppel-type zinc-finger protein family. This protein functions as a transcriptional regulator, characterized by its KRAB domain and multiple C2H2 zinc-finger domains, which are essential for its role in transcription regulation and chromatin remodeling (Lugtenberg2006ZNF674:). ZNF674 is expressed in various tissues, including the fetal brain and testis, indicating its potential involvement in neurological and reproductive processes (Lugtenberg2006ZNF674:). Clinically, mutations or deletions in ZNF674 have been associated with X-linked intellectual disability and retinal dystrophy, although its precise role in these conditions remains under investigation (Delphin2011Intellectual). Recent studies suggest that while ZNF674 may contribute to these disorders, other genetic factors may also play a significant role (Delphin2011Intellectual).

## Function
ZNF674 is a member of the Kruppel-type zinc-finger protein family, which is one of the largest families of transcriptional regulators in the human genome. It contains a KRAB domain and 11 C2H2 zinc-finger domains, which are crucial for its function in transcription regulation and chromatin remodeling (Lugtenberg2006ZNF674:). The KRAB domain of ZNF674 binds to KAP-1, a protein that recruits other proteins to form a multiprotein nuclear receptor corepressor (N-CoR) complex. This complex includes histone-modifying proteins such as histone deacetylase 3 and SETDB1, a histone H3, lysine 9-specific methyltransferase. The N-CoR complex mediates the formation of a heterochromatin environment on target promoters, leading to gene silencing (Lugtenberg2006ZNF674:).

ZNF674 is expressed in fetal brain, EBV-LCLs, and testis, suggesting its involvement in neurological and reproductive functions (Lugtenberg2006ZNF674:). Although the exact function of ZNF674 in healthy human cells is not fully understood, it is suggested to play a role in transcription regulation and chromatin remodeling, similar to other genes implicated in X-linked mental retardation (Lugtenberg2006ZNF674:).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF674 is implicated in X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) and retinal dystrophy. Mutations or deletions in the ZNF674 gene have been associated with intellectual disability, although the specific role of ZNF674 in these conditions remains to be fully elucidated (Delphin2011Intellectual). The gene is located in the Xp11.3-p11.23 region, and its deletion has been studied in the context of X-linked retinal dystrophies (XLRD) co-segregating with intellectual disability. However, recent findings challenge the assumption that ZNF674 deletions are directly responsible for intellectual disability. In two unrelated families with large deletions in this region, including ZNF674, individuals exhibited severe retinal dystrophy without intellectual disability, suggesting that the gene's role in causing intellectual disability is questionable (Delphin2011Intellectual).

The study highlights that while retinal dystrophy symptoms, such as high myopia and retinal atrophy, are attributed to the RP2 gene, the absence of intellectual disability in these cases suggests that ZNF674 may not be solely responsible for cognitive impairments. This indicates that other genetic or environmental factors may contribute to the manifestation of intellectual disability in the presence of ZNF674 deletions (Delphin2011Intellectual).
