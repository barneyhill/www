# ZFHX3

## Overview
ZFHX3, also known as ATBF1, is a gene that encodes the zinc finger homeobox 3 protein, a large transcription factor characterized by its 23 zinc finger motifs and four homeodomains. This protein plays a crucial role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation, influencing various biological processes such as mammary gland development, neurodevelopment, and circadian rhythm regulation. As a transcription factor, zinc finger homeobox 3 is involved in the regulation of gene expression by interacting with specific DNA sequences and other proteins, including estrogen receptor beta and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α, which are important in cancer biology and angiogenesis (Wu2020SUMOylation; Hu2019ZFHX3; Zhao2016Zinc; Fu2020The). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its association with conditions such as atrial fibrillation and neurodevelopmental disorders, where mutations or altered expression can lead to significant health impacts (del2023A; Zaw2017Association).

## Structure
ZFHX3, also known as ATBF1, is a large transcription factor with a molecular weight of approximately 404 kDa, characterized by its complex structure, which includes 23 zinc finger motifs and four homeodomains (Wu2020SUMOylation; Zhao2016Zinc). These structural features suggest a role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation, as zinc finger motifs typically facilitate interactions with DNA (Sun2014Deletion). The presence of multiple homeodomains is relatively rare among homeobox genes, indicating a dynamic role in various biological processes (Zhao2016Zinc).

The primary structure of ZFHX3 includes a sequence rich in zinc finger motifs, which are likely to form alpha helices and beta sheets in the secondary structure, typical of zinc finger proteins. The tertiary structure is influenced by the folding of these motifs, although specific details on the quaternary structure are not provided in the available context.

ZFHX3 undergoes post-translational modifications, notably SUMOylation at lysine 2806, which enhances its stability by preventing ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (Wu2020SUMOylation). This modification is crucial for its function in cell proliferation and tumor growth, particularly in breast cancer cells (Wu2020SUMOylation).

## Function
The ZFHX3 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a significant role in various biological processes, including mammary gland development, neurodevelopment, and circadian rhythm regulation. In the mammary gland, ZFHX3 is crucial for alveologenesis and lactogenic differentiation by maintaining prolactin signaling activity. It regulates the expression of the prolactin receptor (PRLR) and downstream signaling pathways involving JAK2 and STAT5, which are essential for the expression of genes like Elf5 and Id2, and for milk protein production such as β-casein (Zhao2016Zinc).

In the nervous system, ZFHX3 is involved in neuron and axon development, interacting with protein complexes like BAF and CP. It binds to promoter regions of genes associated with axonogenesis and neurogenesis, and is linked to pathways such as axon guidance, Wnt, Hippo, and mTOR signaling (del2023A). ZFHX3 also plays a role in circadian rhythm regulation, particularly in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), where it influences the transcription of clock-related genes and neuropeptides, maintaining the circadian clock's pace and amplitude (Bafna2023Zinc; Wilcox2017Inducible).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ZFHX3 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. In the context of cardiac health, ZFHX3 is linked to atrial fibrillation (AF), a common cardiac arrhythmia. Genetic variants such as SNP rs2106261 have been identified as risk markers for AF, with the A allele and AA genotype significantly increasing AF risk (Liu2014Genetic; Zaw2017Association). ZFHX3 knockdown leads to altered expression of microRNAs, affecting calcium homeostasis and contributing to arrhythmogenesis, which can be mitigated by miR-133 mimics (Cheng2019MicroRNA‐133).

In neurodevelopment, loss-of-function mutations in ZFHX3 are implicated in a novel neurodevelopmental syndrome characterized by intellectual disability, developmental delay, and other neurological symptoms. These mutations result in protein truncation or nonsense-mediated decay, affecting neurodevelopmental processes (del2023A). The gene's role in chromatin remodeling and neuron development underscores its importance in neurodevelopmental disorders (del2023A).

ZFHX3 is also involved in cardiac excitability by repressing the SCN5A gene, which encodes the Nav1.5 sodium channel, thereby influencing sodium current density and potentially contributing to arrhythmogenic syndromes (RubioAlarcón2021Zfhx3).

## Interactions
ZFHX3, also known as ATBF1, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. In prostate cancer cells, ZFHX3 interacts with estrogen receptor beta (ERβ), which is crucial for inhibiting cell proliferation through the downregulation of MYC expression. This interaction is facilitated by the NR-box motif of ZFHX3, which is known to interact with ERα, a protein similar to ERβ (Hu2019ZFHX3).

In the context of liver cancer, ZFHX3 interacts with hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1A) to promote angiogenesis. This interaction is essential for the transcriptional activation of the vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) gene under hypoxic conditions. ZFHX3 binds to the VEGFA promoter and physically associates with HIF1A, which is necessary for the angiogenic processes in hepatocellular carcinoma (Fu2020The).

ZFHX3 also undergoes posttranslational modification through SUMOylation, which enhances its stability and function. SUMOylation at lysine 2806 prevents ZFHX3 from being ubiquitinated and degraded, thereby stabilizing the protein. This modification is crucial for ZFHX3's role in promoting cell proliferation, particularly in breast cancer cells (Wu2020SUMOylation).
