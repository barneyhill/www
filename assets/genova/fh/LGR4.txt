# LGR4

## Overview
LGR4, or leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 4, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane receptor protein involved in various physiological processes. The LGR4 protein is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, characterized by its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions. This receptor plays a pivotal role in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, influencing cell proliferation, differentiation, and stem cell maintenance. LGR4 is also implicated in bone biology, acting as an alternative receptor for RANKL to regulate osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption. Its expression is widespread across tissues, including the intestine and pancreas, highlighting its importance in cellular proliferation and differentiation. Alterations in LGR4 expression or function are associated with various diseases, including cancer and immune-related conditions, underscoring its clinical significance (OrdazRamos2021The; Filipowska2022LGR4; Li2015LGR4).

## Structure
The LGR4 protein is characterized by its extracellular domain (ECD), which adopts a horseshoe-like structure composed of 17 leucine-rich repeat (LRR) modules. These modules are flanked by disulfide-bonded cap-like structures at both the N-terminal (LRRNT) and C-terminal (LRRCT) ends. The LRR modules feature a signature 'LxxLxLxxNxL' motif, with variations in LRR11 and LRR12 where the 'N' position is replaced by alanine and threonine, respectively. This alteration disrupts the asparagine ladder, resulting in two separate smooth beta sheets: LRR1 to LRR10 and LRR13 to LRR17 (Wang2013Structural).

The LRRNT is a typical beta-hairpin capping structure, while the LRRCT consists of two ordered structural motifs with a disordered region between them. The first motif includes a beta strand and a short helix, forming a noncanonical CF3 motif. The second motif also contains a beta strand, extending the beta sheet 2 of the LRR region. The LRRCT has five conserved cysteines, forming two disulfide bonds crucial for the structural integrity of the LGR4-ECD (Wang2013Structural).

LGR4 can form dimers, indicating a quaternary structure, and has several splice variant isoforms that may affect its function and localization (Toh2023LGR4).

## Function
LGR4, also known as GPR48, is a leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor that plays a crucial role in various molecular processes and cell biology. It is primarily involved in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is essential for regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and maintaining adult stem cell homeostasis (Li2015LGR4). LGR4 interacts with R-spondins to potentiate Wnt signaling, facilitating the accumulation of β-catenin and activation of TCF target genes, which are important for cell adhesion, migration, and development (Li2015LGR4).

In bone biology, LGR4 acts as an alternative receptor for RANKL, inhibiting osteoclastogenesis and preventing excessive bone resorption, which is crucial for maintaining bone density (Filipowska2022LGR4). In the liver, LGR4 modulates RSPOs-LGR4 signaling to reduce cell death and enhance hepatocyte proliferation, contributing to liver zonation and regeneration (OrdazRamos2021The).

LGR4 is also expressed in various tissues, including the intestine, where it is found in crypts and Paneth cells, and the pancreas, where it is present in β-cells, indicating its significant role in cellular proliferation and differentiation (Li2015LGR4). Its widespread expression and involvement in multiple signaling pathways underscore its importance in development and tissue-specific functions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the LGR4 gene are associated with various diseases and conditions. In cancer, LGR4 is overexpressed in several types, including prostate, breast, colorectal, lung, and skin cancers, where it is linked to poor prognosis and increased tumorigenesis. It influences cancer progression through pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin and PI3K/AKT, and its inhibition can reduce proliferation and metastasis (OrdazRamos2021The). In prostate cancer, high LGR4 expression correlates with shorter recurrence times, and its overexpression is associated with androgen receptor activity (OrdazRamos2021The).

LGR4 also plays a role in immune-related conditions. It is involved in the polarization of tumor-associated macrophages to an immunosuppressive M2 phenotype, promoting tumor progression and resistance to treatments like anti-PD1 therapy (Yang2022Emerging). In inflammatory bowel disease, LGR4 deficiency leads to increased susceptibility and severity due to impaired epithelial barrier function and reduced stem cell numbers (Liu2013Lgr4).

A loss-of-function mutation in LGR4 has been linked to severe neonatal salt-wasting crises due to isolated aldosterone deficiency, along with syndromic features such as nail dysplasia and mental disability. This mutation disrupts Wnt/β-catenin signaling, crucial for adrenal function (Lucas2023Loss).

## Interactions
LGR4, also known as leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 4, engages in several significant interactions with proteins and signaling pathways. It binds to R-spondins (RSPOs), which enhances Wnt/β-catenin signaling by stabilizing the frizzled/LRP5-6 complex and inhibiting the activity of E3 ubiquitin ligases RNF43 and ZNRF3, preventing the degradation of Wnt receptors (Toh2023LGR4; OrdazRamos2021The). LGR4 forms a complex with RNF43/ZNRF3, which is crucial for high-affinity binding of RSPO ligands, a feature not shared by its homolog LGR5 (Toh2023LGR4).

LGR4 also interacts with RANKL, a ligand involved in bone remodeling, by binding to its extracellular domain. This interaction activates a Gαq protein, inhibiting the GSK3β signaling pathway and suppressing NFATC1 expression, which is essential in osteoclastogenesis (OrdazRamos2021The). Additionally, LGR4 competes with RANK to bind RANKL, acting as a feedback mechanism in RANKL activities (OrdazRamos2021The).

In cancer processes, LGR4 is linked to various signaling pathways, including PI3K/AKT and Wnt/β-catenin, influencing tumor growth and metastasis (OrdazRamos2021The). It also regulates immune cell behavior in the tumor microenvironment, promoting M2 macrophage polarization through RSPOs/LGR4/ERK/STAT3 signaling (OrdazRamos2021The).
