# OSBPL11

## Overview
OSBPL11 is a gene that encodes the oxysterol-binding protein-like 11 (ORP11), a member of the oxysterol-binding protein family, which plays a significant role in lipid metabolism and transport. ORP11 is characterized by its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and OSBP-related ligand-binding domain (ORD), which facilitate its function as a lipid sensor or transporter within cells. The protein is primarily localized at the Golgi-late endosome interface, where it interacts with ORP9 to form a functional dimer, crucial for its subcellular targeting and lipid transport activities (Zhou2010OSBPrelated). ORP11 is highly expressed in tissues involved in lipid metabolism, such as the liver and adipose tissue, and is implicated in non-vesicular lipid transport, influencing cellular lipid homeostasis and signaling pathways (Zhou2010OSBPrelated).

## Structure
The OSBPL11 gene encodes the oxysterol-binding protein-related protein 11 (ORP11), which is part of the OSBP family involved in lipid metabolism and transport. ORP11 contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that binds to various phosphoinositides, including PtdIns(3)P, -(4)P, -(5)P, and phosphatidic acid, suggesting a role in membrane targeting (Zhou2010OSBPrelated). The protein also features an OSBP-related ligand-binding domain (ORD), which is involved in lipid binding and is cytosolic in nature (Zhou2010OSBPrelated).

The N-terminal region of ORP11 is crucial for its subcellular targeting, particularly to the Golgi and late endosomes, and is involved in its interaction with ORP9 (Zhou2010OSBPrelated). ORP11 lacks a FFAT motif or other known ER targeting signals, which distinguishes it from other OSBP family members (Zhou2010OSBPrelated).

ORP11 can dimerize with ORP9, which influences its localization at the Golgi-late endosome interface, indicating a quaternary structure aspect through protein-protein interactions (Zhou2010OSBPrelated). The interaction domains for ORP11 and ORP9 are located between specific amino acid sequences, highlighting the structural specificity required for their interaction (Zhou2010OSBPrelated).

## Function
OSBPL11, also known as oxysterol-binding protein-like 11, is a member of the oxysterol-binding protein family involved in lipid metabolism and transport. In healthy human cells, OSBPL11 plays a crucial role in intracellular lipid transport and cellular lipid distribution. It is primarily localized at the Golgi-late endosome interface, where it interacts with ORP9 to form a dimer that functions as an intracellular lipid sensor or transporter (Zhou2010OSBPrelated). This interaction is essential for the Golgi localization of OSBPL11, as ORP9 recruits it to membranes, and silencing ORP9 disrupts this association (Zhou2010OSBPrelated).

OSBPL11 is highly expressed in tissues involved in lipid metabolism, such as the liver, kidney, and adipose tissue, and is particularly abundant in regions with active lipid processing (Zhou2010OSBPrelated). The protein is implicated in non-vesicular lipid transport between late endosomes and the Golgi, potentially affecting organelle lipid compositions and cellular lipid homeostasis (Zhou2010OSBPrelated). Its pleckstrin homology domain binds to various phosphoinositides, which is crucial for its targeting to the Golgi complex (Zhou2010OSBPrelated). Through these functions, OSBPL11 contributes to the regulation of lipid metabolism and cellular signaling pathways.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the OSBPL11 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In obesity, polymorphisms in OSBPL11 are associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, including high diastolic blood pressure, elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, hyperglycemia, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome (Bouchard2009Association). The gene's expression is linked to cholesterol and glucose metabolism, suggesting its role in metabolic complications among obese individuals (Bouchard2009Association).

In the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), OSBPL11 is targeted by miR-7-5p, a microRNA that inhibits AML progression by reducing OSBPL11 expression. This interaction affects the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell survival and proliferation, indicating that OSBPL11 acts as a carcinogen in AML (Jiang2022Bone).

Additionally, a variant in OSBPL11, c.511C4T (p.(Arg171Trp)), has been associated with increased cholesterol deposition, potentially contributing to a phenotype similar to Niemann-Pick disease type C. This variant may exacerbate disease severity by affecting intracellular lipid transport (Kara2017Severe).

## Interactions
OSBPL11, also known as oxysterol binding protein-like 11, is known to interact with several proteins, most notably ORP9. This interaction is crucial for its subcellular localization and function. ORP11 dimerizes with ORP9, and this interaction is essential for its localization at the Golgi-late endosome interface. The specific interaction domains have been identified within amino acids 106-195 of ORP9 and 154-292 of ORP11. This interaction is confirmed through yeast two-hybrid screens and immunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293 cells (Zhou2010OSBPrelated).

ORP9 targets the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi membranes, and when co-expressed with its ER membrane receptor VAP-A, it recruits ORP11 to ER membranes. Silencing ORP9 disrupts the Golgi localization of ORP11, indicating the importance of their interaction for proper subcellular distribution (Zhou2010OSBPrelated).

In addition to its interaction with ORP9, ORP11 is involved in sterol trafficking, particularly in cooperation with bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP). This interaction is significant in modulating the protective action of BMP against the cytotoxic effects of oxidized LDL by controlling intracellular cholesterol/oxysterol trafficking (ArnalLevron2019Bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate page 5 of 6).
