# AFAP1

## Overview
AFAP1, or actin filament associated protein 1, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional adaptor protein involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. The protein, also referred to as AFAP-110, plays a critical role in cellular processes such as motility, adhesion, and signal transduction by interacting with actin filaments and various signaling molecules. It is characterized by several structural domains, including actin-binding domains, SH3 and SH2 binding motifs, and pleckstrin homology domains, which facilitate its interactions with proteins like Src family kinases and protein kinase C (QIAN1999Monoclonal; Baisden2001The). AFAP1 is expressed in a variety of cell types and is particularly active in dynamic cellular structures such as lamellipodia and filopodia, contributing to its role in cytoskeletal organization and cellular signaling (Qian2003Analysis; Baisden2001The). The gene's dysregulation has been implicated in diseases such as primary open-angle glaucoma and various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Gharahkhani2014Common; Han2016Long).

## Structure
AFAP1, also known as AFAP-110, is a protein involved in actin cytoskeleton organization. It consists of 637 amino acids and includes several structural motifs and domains that contribute to its function. The primary structure of AFAP1 features multiple phosphorylation sites, including tyrosine, serine, and threonine residues, which are potential targets for Src-like tyrosine kinases and protein kinase C (Flynn1993Identification).

The secondary structure of AFAP1 includes a long α-helical region at the carboxy terminus, which is crucial for its self-association and interaction with actin filaments. This region contains a leucine zipper motif, which is involved in protein dimerization and multimerization, although it does not mediate classical hydrophobic interactions (QIAN1999Monoclonal).

AFAP1's tertiary structure is characterized by several protein-binding domains, including SH3 and SH2 binding motifs, pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, and actin-binding domains (ABD1 and ABD3). These domains facilitate interactions with other proteins, such as Src, and contribute to its role in cellular signaling and cytoskeletal organization (QIAN1999Monoclonal).

AFAP1 can form multimeric complexes, existing as monomers, dimers, trimers, or tetramers, which are influenced by its interaction with Src and post-translational modifications (QIAN1999Monoclonal). The protein also has splice variant isoforms, such as AFAP-120, which includes an additional sequence but retains the conserved carboxy terminal region, indicating its functional importance (QIAN1999Monoclonal).

## Function
AFAP1 (actin filament associated protein 1) functions as an adaptor protein that modulates actin filament integrity in healthy human cells. It interacts with actin filaments through its carboxy-terminal actin-binding domain, facilitating crosslinking and playing a crucial role in the dynamic rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton (Xiao2011The; Baisden2001The). AFAP1 is involved in the activation of cSrc signaling pathways, which are essential for various cellular processes, including cell motility and adhesion (Cunnick2014Actin; Baisden2001The). 

The protein is expressed in various cell types, including fibroblasts, epithelial, endothelial, and hematopoietic cells, and is localized mainly to stress filaments and the cell membrane (Baisden2001The). AFAP1 is particularly active in structures such as lamellipodia and filopodia, which are involved in cell movement (Qian2003Analysis). It also plays a role in the formation of podosomes, actin-rich structures that assist in tissue invasion and cellular signaling (Xiao2011The). 

In the context of bone physiology, AFAP1 acts as a downstream mediator in the TGF-β1 signaling pathway, crucial for the production of extracellular matrix proteins (Cho2015AFAP1). Additionally, AFAP1 is important for normal breast physiology, particularly in lactation, where it is required for cSrc activity and secretory activation in the mammary gland (Cunnick2014Actin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the AFAP1 gene have been implicated in the pathogenesis of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). AFAP1 is expressed in ocular tissues such as the trabecular meshwork, retina, and optic nerve, and its dysregulation may contribute to the disease. Genome-wide association studies have identified genetic variants near AFAP1 that are associated with an increased risk of POAG, suggesting a potential role in the disease's development (Gharahkhani2014Common).

In cancer, AFAP1-AS1, a long non-coding RNA transcribed in an antisense fashion overlapping with AFAP1, is overexpressed in various malignancies, including colorectal cancer, cervical cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and lung cancer. This overexpression is often associated with poor prognosis and increased tumor aggressiveness. In colorectal cancer, AFAP1-AS1 promotes tumor growth and metastasis by modulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and AFAP1 protein expression (Han2016Long). In lung cancer, AFAP1-AS1 interacts with SNIP1 to upregulate c-Myc, enhancing cell migration and invasion (Zhong2021Long). These findings suggest that AFAP1 and its associated non-coding RNA play significant roles in cancer progression and may serve as potential therapeutic targets.

## Interactions
AFAP1, also known as actin filament-associated protein 1, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cytoskeletal dynamics and signal transduction. It directly binds to actin filaments through its carboxy-terminal actin-binding domain, facilitating its role as an adaptor protein that recruits Src family kinases and other signaling molecules to actin filaments (Bourguignon2011Interaction; Baisden2001The). AFAP1 interacts with Src family kinases, such as Src, Lyn, and Fyn, through SH3 domain interactions, although it does not bind to cYes (Baisden2001The). These interactions are crucial for AFAP1's role in modulating actin filament integrity and forming larger signaling complexes.

AFAP1 also contains pleckstrin homology (PH) domains that facilitate interactions with proteins like protein kinase C (PKC) and phospholipids, contributing to signaling pathways involving PKC and phosphoinositides (Baisden2001The). In breast tumor cells, AFAP1 interacts with CD44 following stimulation by low molecular weight hyaluronan (LMW-HA), forming a complex that binds to F-actin and is essential for tumor cell invasion (Bourguignon2011Interaction). This interaction is critical for cytoskeleton-regulated processes and MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathways (Bourguignon2011Interaction).
