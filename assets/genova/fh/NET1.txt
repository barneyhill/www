# NET1

## Overview
The NET1 gene encodes the neuroepithelial cell transforming 1 protein, which functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) specific for the RhoA and RhoB GTPases. This protein plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling by facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rho GTPases, thereby regulating the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and gene transcription in response to extracellular stimuli (Petit2018A; Schmidt2002The). The NET1 protein is characterized by its Dbl Homology (DH) and Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domains, which are crucial for its activity and nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling (Petit2018A; Schmidt2002The). NET1 is involved in various cellular processes, including stress fiber formation, cytoskeletal organization, and apoptosis, particularly in response to DNA damage (Srougi2011The). Alterations in NET1 expression have been linked to the progression of several cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (FANG2015Neuroepithelial; Zuo2018Contributions).

## Structure
The NET1 protein is characterized by its Dbl Homology (DH) and Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domains, which are essential for its function as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) specific for RhoA and RhoB GTPases (Petit2018A). The DH domain facilitates the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rho GTPases, while the PH domain stabilizes the nucleotide-free form of RhoA by altering the structures of the two switches (Petit2018A). The PH domain is a flattened, 7-stranded beta-barrel structure, which is crucial for the protein's activity and nuclear export function (Petit2018A; Schmidt2002The).

The interaction between the DH/PH domains and RhoA involves polar interactions, salt bridges, and hydrophobic interactions, with the PH domain playing a unique role in stabilizing the complex (Petit2018A). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence the activity and interactions of NET1, although specific sites are not detailed in the context provided (Schmidt2002The). The protein's structure and interactions are significant for its role in cellular signaling and potential as a target for anticancer drug development (Petit2018A).

## Function
The NET1 gene encodes a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that is specific for the small GTPase Rho, playing a crucial role in the regulation of Rho GTPases in healthy human cells. These GTPases are key molecules involved in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and gene transcription, driving various biological responses following extracellular stimuli (Schmidt2002The). NET1 is primarily localized in the nucleus, where its activity is regulated by nuclear localization signals in its N-terminal region. The pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of NET1 acts as a nuclear export signal, allowing the protein to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. This shuttling is essential for the activation of Rho in the cytoplasm, which is necessary for processes such as stress fiber formation and cytoskeletal organization (Schmidt2002The).

In the context of DNA damage, NET1 is activated and contributes to the regulation of RhoB-mediated cell death. This involves the downstream phosphorylation of JNK and the induction of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim, leading to cell death. The activation of NET1 in response to DNA damage suggests its involvement in cellular stress responses and apoptosis (Srougi2011The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NET1 gene have been implicated in the progression of several cancers. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), NET1 is overexpressed, correlating with poor clinical outcomes such as higher clinical stages, lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis. This suggests that NET1 may serve as an independent prognostic biomarker for NSCLC, highlighting its role in the invasive ability of the cancer (FANG2015Neuroepithelial).

In breast cancer, NET1 is crucial for tumorigenesis and metastasis. Studies using mouse models have shown that the deletion of NET1 delays tumor development and significantly reduces metastasis. NET1 is essential for RhoA activation, which is necessary for cell motility and tumor progression, indicating its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention (Zuo2018Contributions).

In gastric cancer, NET1 is upregulated and associated with increased cell migration and invasion. Knockdown of NET1 results in reduced cell proliferation and invasion, suggesting its role in tumor growth and metastasis. NET1's interaction with RhoA and its response to pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-alpha further link it to cancer progression (Bennett2011A; Leyden2006Net1).

## Interactions
The human gene NET1 (neuroepithelial cell transforming 1) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. One of the key interactions of NET1 is with merlin, a protein encoded by the NF2 gene. This interaction was identified through yeast two-hybrid screening and confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation assays in HEK 293 cells. Merlin regulates the degradation of NET1 via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, facilitating the ubiquitination of NET1, which leads to its degradation. This was demonstrated by increased NET1 levels upon treatment with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, indicating that merlin promotes NET1 ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (Ye2014A).

In yeast, NET1 is part of the RENT complex, which includes the phosphatase Cdc14 and the deacetylase Sir2. NET1 interacts with Cdc14 through its NH2-terminal fragment, acting as a competitive inhibitor of Cdc14's phosphatase activity. This interaction is crucial for regulating the cell cycle, as NET1 sequesters Cdc14 in the nucleolus during interphase and early mitosis, releasing it during late anaphase to promote mitotic exit (Traverso2001Characterization). NET1 also interacts with Sir2, playing a role in rDNA silencing and nucleolar integrity (Straight1999Net1).
