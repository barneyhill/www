# ZNF780B

## Overview
ZNF780B is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 780B, a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by their ability to bind DNA and regulate gene expression. As a transcription factor, zinc finger protein 780B is primarily involved in modulating the expression of genes associated with neuronal function and development. It is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it exerts its regulatory functions. The protein is expressed in various human tissues, including the brain and heart, indicating its potential role in critical developmental processes. Notably, a human-specific alteration in the 17th zinc finger motif of ZNF780B distinguishes it from its primate counterparts, suggesting a possible impact on DNA binding and regulatory functions that may contribute to human-specific traits (Nowick2011Gain).

## Function
ZNF780B is a zinc finger protein that plays a significant role in gene regulation through its DNA-binding capabilities. It is involved in various molecular processes, primarily functioning as a transcription factor that modulates the expression of target genes. The protein is active in the nucleus, where it interacts with DNA to influence gene expression, particularly in genes associated with neuronal function and development (Nowick2011Gain).

In humans, ZNF780B is expressed in multiple tissues, including the brain and heart, suggesting its involvement in critical developmental processes. The protein's activity is linked to neurogenesis, as it interacts with TCF12, a protein important for this process. This interaction indicates that ZNF780B may contribute to the regulation of genes essential for neuronal development (Nowick2011Gain).

The human-specific change in a DNA-contacting amino acid in ZNF780B's 17th functional ZNF motif distinguishes it from its primate orthologs, potentially altering its DNA binding sites and regulatory functions. This change may have functional consequences that influence the development or regulation of the nervous system, muscles, limbs, or teeth, highlighting its role in human-specific traits (Nowick2011Gain).
