# MARK2

## Overview
MARK2, or microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 2, is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics and cell polarity. The protein product of MARK2 plays a pivotal role in cellular processes by phosphorylating microtubule-associated proteins, thereby modulating their interaction with microtubules and influencing microtubule stability. This kinase is crucial for various cellular functions, including intracellular transport, cell division, and neuronal differentiation. MARK2's activity is tightly regulated through phosphorylation and its subcellular localization, impacting processes such as cell polarization and migration. The gene has been implicated in several neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in conditions like autism spectrum disorder and Alzheimer's disease (Gong2024MARK2variants; Matenia2009The; Marx2010Structure).

## Structure
The human gene MARK2 encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase involved in regulating cell polarity and microtubule dynamics. The primary structure of MARK2 includes several conserved domains: an N-terminal header, a catalytic protein kinase domain (CAT), a common docking domain (CD), a ubiquitin-associated domain (UBA), a spacer domain, and a C-terminal tail domain with a kinase-associated domain (KA1) (Ahrari2017Interconversion; Marx2010Structure). The secondary structure of MARK2 features a classic kinase bilobal structure, with the N-lobe composed mainly of β-sheets and one α-helix, and the C-lobe consisting of six α-helices and an extended loop (Ahrari2017Interconversion; Marx2010Structure).

The tertiary structure of MARK2 includes a catalytic domain near the N-terminus, followed by a small accessory regulatory domain, and often a KA1 domain at the C-terminus (Marx2010Structure). The UBA domain is suggested to have an autoregulatory role, acting as a bistable switch that stabilizes both inactive and active conformations of MARK2 (Marx2010Structure). The quaternary structure details are less defined, but the protein shows a propensity for dimerization, although the physiological role of MARK homodimerization is not yet demonstrated (Marx2010Structure).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a crucial role in regulating MARK2's activity. Phosphorylation at Thr208 is essential for activation, while phosphorylation at Ser212 by GSK3β inhibits its activity (Marx2010Structure). Splice variants of MARK2 may exist, altering its functional properties (Marx2010Structure).

## Function
MARK2 (microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 2) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a critical role in regulating microtubule dynamics and cell polarity in healthy human cells. It phosphorylates microtubule-associated proteins such as tau, MAP2, and MAP4 at specific KXGS motifs, which reduces their affinity for microtubules and leads to microtubule disassembly. This process is essential for maintaining microtubule stability and dynamics, crucial for cellular functions like intracellular transport and cell division (Timm2003MARKK; Marx2006Structural).

MARK2 is involved in various cellular processes, including neuronal differentiation, where it regulates axonal and dendritic growth. In neurons, MARK2 activity is necessary for neurite outgrowth and differentiation, contributing to the development of neuronal polarity by promoting the detachment of tau from microtubules (Matenia2009The; Chen2006Microtubule). It is also implicated in cell cycle control and cellular signaling pathways, influencing processes such as cell polarization and migration (Marx2010Structure).

The kinase is activated by phosphorylation at a conserved threonine residue (T208) by upstream kinases like MARKK/TAO-1 and LKB1, which is necessary for its function (Matenia2009The; Wu2017Regulation). MARK2's activity is regulated by its localization within the cell, being active in the cytoplasm and cell cortex, where it influences cytoskeletal organization and cellular architecture (Matenia2009The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MARK2 gene have been implicated in several neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders. MARK2 is identified as a novel risk gene for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), with studies reporting de novo loss-of-function (LoF) variants in individuals with ASD. These variants are associated with the downregulation of the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway, contributing to neurodevelopmental deficits and ASD-like behaviors (Gong2024MARK2variants). The gene is considered a candidate for syndromic and low-function ASD, with clinical features including intellectual disability, speech-language problems, and seizures (Gong2024MARK2variants).

In addition to ASD, MARK2 is linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and bipolar disorder (BIP) through its role in tau phosphorylation and neuronal migration. MARK2 increases tau phosphorylation, a process associated with tauopathy in AD (Drange2019Genetic). The gene's involvement in neuronal connectivity and synaptic transmission also suggests its potential role in epilepsy and other neurological disorders, with studies showing increased seizure susceptibility in MARK2-deficient mice (Caiola2023Neuronal). These findings underscore the clinical significance of MARK2 in various neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative conditions.

## Interactions
MARK2 (microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 2) is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. MARK2 interacts with PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1), particularly through their catalytic domains. This interaction is significant in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, as MARK2 phosphorylates PINK1 at Thr-313, a site associated with Parkinson's disease. This phosphorylation enhances PINK1's kinase activity and affects mitochondrial transport in neurons (Matenia2012Microtubule).

MARK2 also interacts with the adaptor complex AP-2 of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs). This interaction is crucial for the regulation of microtubule dynamics and vesicle trafficking. MARK2 phosphorylates microtubule-associated proteins such as tau, MAP2, and MAP4, leading to their detachment from microtubules and affecting microtubule stability (Schmitt‐Ulms2009Interactions).

In addition, MARK2 interacts with PAK5, a kinase that inhibits MARK2 activity. This interaction is part of a complex regulatory mechanism involving phosphorylation and protein interactions, which also includes upstream kinases like MARKK/TAO-1 and LKB1 that activate MARK2, and GSK-3b that inhibits it (Schmitt‐Ulms2009Interactions).
