# TRIOBP

## Overview
The TRIOBP gene encodes the TRIO and F-actin binding protein, which plays a crucial role in the organization and stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton. This gene produces multiple protein isoforms, including TRIOBP-1 and TRIOBP-4, each with distinct structural and functional properties. TRIOBP-1 is characterized by its structured domains, including a Pleckstrin homology domain and coiled-coil domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and oligomerization. In contrast, TRIOBP-4 is largely disordered and specializes in binding and organizing actin filaments into tightly packed bundles, a function vital for the structural integrity of stereocilia in the inner ear. The proteins encoded by TRIOBP are involved in various cellular processes, such as neuronal differentiation and cell migration, and have been implicated in several clinical conditions, including hearing loss, schizophrenia, and certain cancers (Wang2023TRIOBP; Zaharija2020The; Shahin2006Mutations).

## Structure
The TRIOBP gene encodes multiple protein isoforms, with TRIOBP-1 and TRIOBP-4 being the most studied. TRIOBP-1 is a structured protein that includes a Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain near its N-terminus and two coiled-coil (CC) domains in its C-terminal half. The PH domain is predicted to be a compact folded domain, potentially involved in protein-protein interactions, although its exact function remains unknown (Zaharija2020The). The central coiled-coil domain is responsible for oligomerization, forming an elongated hexamer through homodimeric and homotrimeric interactions (Zaharija2020The). TRIOBP-1 can exist in two forms, 593 or 652 amino acids in length, due to different start codons (Zaharija2020The).

TRIOBP-4, in contrast, is predicted to be almost entirely disordered, lacking fixed secondary or tertiary structure. It contains two repeat regions, R1 and R2, which are involved in binding to F-actin and organizing actin filaments into densely packed bundles (Zaharija2020The). The R1 region has a high isoelectric point and consists of six repeats, while the R2 region has a lower isoelectric point and consists of five repeats (Zaharija2020The).

TRIOBP proteins are involved in various cellular functions, including actin stabilization and neuronal differentiation, and are implicated in conditions such as schizophrenia and hearing loss (Zaharija2020The).

## Function
The TRIOBP gene encodes proteins that are crucial for actin cytoskeleton organization, playing significant roles in cellular structure and function. TRIOBP-1, one of the isoforms, binds to actin filaments, preventing their depolymerization into G-actin, which is essential for maintaining cell structure and facilitating movement. It is involved in cellular migration, particularly in neuroblastoma cells, where it enhances F-actin levels, promoting neurite outgrowth and dendritic arborization (Zaharija2020The). TRIOBP-1 is also found in focal adhesions and adhesion junctions, where it regulates E-cadherin expression and interacts with proteins like JCAD and hERG1, affecting cell adhesion and cardiac function (Zaharija2020The).

TRIOBP-4, another isoform, is involved in actin stabilization by organizing actin filaments into densely packed bundles, a function critical in the hair cells of the inner ear. These cells are responsible for mechano-electrical transduction, converting sound-induced fluid motion into neuronal signals. TRIOBP-4's actin bundling is essential for the formation and stability of stereocilia rootlets, necessary for proper hearing (Zaharija2020The). The R1 motif of TRIOBP-5/-4 is identified as the major actin-binding domain, contributing to the structural integrity of stereocilia (Zhou2020A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TRIOBP gene are associated with several clinical conditions, most notably hearing loss. TRIOBP mutations, particularly in the TRIOBP-4 isoform, are linked to DFNB28, a form of autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss. These mutations often result in severe to profound hearing impairment due to the failure of stereocilia rootlets to form properly, leading to their degeneration (Zaharija2020The; Shahin2006Mutations). Specific mutations, such as R347X and Q581X, have been identified in consanguineous families and are associated with prelingual, profound hearing loss (Shahin2006Mutations). 

TRIOBP is also implicated in mental health disorders. The TRIOBP-1 isoform has been associated with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression, where its aggregates are found in the brains of affected individuals. Although not a direct genetic risk factor, its expression levels are elevated in schizophrenia patients (Zaharija2020The). 

In cancer, TRIOBP-4 is upregulated in pancreatic cancer, promoting cell proliferation. Knockdown of TRIOBP-4 in cancer cell lines reduces proliferation, indicating its role in cancer progression (Zaharija2020The). Missense mutations in TRIOBP-4 have also been found in families with gastric and rectal cancer, though their pathogenicity is not fully confirmed (Zaharija2020The).

## Interactions
TRIOBP, also known as TRIO and F-actin binding protein, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular functions. TRIOBP-1 interacts directly with F-actin, stabilizing actin filaments and preventing their depolymerization. It co-localizes with actin-associated proteins such as actinin and myosin II, although it does not bind to them directly (Zaharija2020The). The central coiled-coil domain of TRIOBP-1 is crucial for its interaction with F-actin, contributing to its role in maintaining F-actin fibers (Zaharija2020The).

TRIOBP-1 also interacts with NDEL1, a neurodevelopmental protein, enhancing F-actin levels and promoting neurite outgrowth and dendritic arborization (Zaharija2020The). It is involved in cell migration and neuronal differentiation, acting synergistically with NDEL1. In the context of mitosis, TRIOBP-1 interacts with TRF1 (Telomere Repeat Factor 1), affecting mitotic progression, and this interaction is regulated by kinases such as PLK1 (Zaharija2020The).

In the heart, TRIOBP-1 interacts with JCAD and the hERG1 ion channel, influencing F-actin stress fiber formation and cardiac rapidity (Zaharija2020The). Additionally, TRIOBP is involved in modulating β-catenin signaling in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis through its interaction with TRIO, affecting the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of β-catenin (Wang2023TRIOBP).
