# RSPH3

## Overview
RSPH3 is a gene that encodes the radial spoke head 3 protein, which is a critical component of the radial spoke complex in cilia and flagella. This protein plays a pivotal role in the motility and structural integrity of these organelles, which are essential for various physiological processes, including respiratory function and sperm motility. The radial spoke head 3 protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domains, facilitating protein-protein interactions necessary for its function within the radial spoke complex. It is involved in signal transduction pathways that regulate ciliary beating, contributing to the dynamic processes of ciliary and flagellar movement. Mutations in the RSPH3 gene are linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia, a disorder that impairs ciliary function, leading to respiratory complications and other clinical manifestations (Blackburn2017Quantitative; Pedersen2023Genotypes).

## Structure
RSPH3 (radial spoke head 3) is a protein integral to the structure and function of cilia and flagella, forming part of the radial spoke complex essential for motility. The protein is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil domains, which are structural motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions, crucial for its role in the radial spoke complex. These domains contribute to the protein's ability to form stable interactions with other components of the ciliary and flagellar structures.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are believed to regulate the function of RSPH3, potentially influencing its interaction with other proteins and its role in ciliary and flagellar motility. The presence of these modifications suggests a level of regulatory control over the protein's activity, which may be critical for the dynamic processes within cilia and flagella.

RSPH3 may also exist in multiple splice variant isoforms, which could lead to proteins with distinct roles or functions within the cell. These isoforms might differ in their structural domains or in their interaction capabilities, allowing for a diverse range of functions and regulatory mechanisms within the ciliary and flagellar systems. The existence of these variants highlights the complexity and adaptability of the RSPH3 protein in cellular processes.

## Function
RSPH3 (radial spoke head 3) is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the structure and function of cilia and flagella. The RSPH3 protein is a component of the radial spoke complex, which is crucial for the motility of these organelles. It plays a significant role in signal transduction pathways that regulate ciliary beating, contributing to essential physiological processes such as respiratory function and sperm motility. In the axoneme, the central shaft of cilia and flagella, RSPH3 helps maintain proper ciliary movement and stability (Blackburn2017Quantitative).

The radial spoke proteins, including RSPH3, are vital for the structural integrity and function of cilia. They account for about 1% of the total axonemal mass, with RSPH3 being part of this complex. Although RSPH3 is less abundant than some other radial spoke proteins like RSPH9 and RSPH4A, it is still essential for the overall function of the cilia (Blackburn2017Quantitative). The precise molecular activities of RSPH3 in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, indicating a need for further research to elucidate its specific roles and interactions within the radial spoke complex.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RSPH3 gene are associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetic disorder characterized by impaired ciliary movement, leading to respiratory issues and chronic infections. The RSPH3 gene is part of the radial spoke and central complex (RS-CC) group, which is linked to a higher median age at diagnosis and a lower prevalence of laterality defects compared to other genetic groups associated with PCD (Pedersen2024Questionnaire; Pedersen2023Genotypes). Patients with mutations in genes related to the radial spoke complex, such as RSPH3, tend to have fewer congenital heart defects and laterality issues, which are common in other forms of PCD (Pedersen2023Genotypes).

The clinical manifestations of PCD due to RSPH3 mutations include chronic respiratory symptoms such as cough, ear pain, and shortness of breath, which are frequently reported across all genotype groups (Pedersen2024Questionnaire). Despite these symptoms, the prevalence of congenital heart disease is lower in patients with RSPH3 mutations compared to those with mutations in other PCD-related genes (Pedersen2023Genotypes). The genetic diversity and clinical manifestations associated with PCD highlight the complexity of diagnosing and managing the condition (Tinoco2023Primary).

## Interactions
RSPH3 is a protein that plays a crucial role in the structure and function of cilia, particularly within the radial spoke complex. It is involved in various protein interactions that are essential for ciliary motility. RSPH3 interacts with adenylate kinase 8 (AK8) within the RS1 complex, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293T cells, where FLAG-Rsph3b and GFP-AK8 were coexpressed, confirming their association (Meng2024Multiscale). 

RSPH3 is also part of a complex network of interactions within the radial spoke head-neck complex. It engages with other subunits such as Rsph4a, Rsph4a', Rsph2, and Rsph23 through its long α-helix, which is wrapped around by the Dpy-30 motifs of these proteins. This interaction network is vital for maintaining the structural integrity of the RS head-neck complex (Meng2024Multiscale). 

Additionally, RSPH3 is involved in interactions with proteins such as RSPH4A, RSPH9, and PRSPH6A, which are important for the assembly and function of radial spokes, contributing to the structural integrity and function of motile cilia (De2023The). These interactions are crucial for the regulation of ciliary motility and the formation of asymmetric planar beat patterns in cilia (Meng2024Multiscale).
