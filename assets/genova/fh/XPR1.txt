# XPR1

## Overview
XPR1 is a gene that encodes the xenotropic and polytropic retrovirus receptor 1, a transmembrane protein primarily involved in the export of inorganic phosphate from human cells. This protein plays a critical role in maintaining phosphate homeostasis, which is essential for various cellular functions, including energy metabolism and signal transduction. The XPR1 protein is characterized by its complex structure, featuring an N-terminal SPX domain and ten transmembrane α-helices, which facilitate its function as a phosphate exporter. It also serves as a receptor for certain retroviruses, mediating their entry into cells. Mutations in the XPR1 gene have been linked to primary familial brain calcification, a disorder marked by abnormal calcium deposits in the brain, leading to neurological and psychiatric symptoms (Zhu2024Transport; Wilson2019The; Anheim2016XPR1).

## Structure
The XPR1 protein is a human inorganic phosphate exporter with a complex molecular structure. It consists of an N-terminal SPX domain and ten transmembrane α-helices (TM1 to TM10) (Zhu2024Transport). The protein functions as a homodimer, with dimerization facilitated by a GxxxG α-helical packing motif in TM1 (Zhu2024Transport). The membrane-embedded domain is divided into two regions: the scaffold domain (TM1-4) that facilitates dimerization, and the transport domain (TM5-10) where the substrate translocation pathway is located (Zhu2024Transport). These domains are connected by a linker helix parallel to the inner leaflet of the membrane. The structure also includes a cholesterol molecule lodged between aromatic residues of TM9 and TM10, and a phosphatidyl lipid occupying an internal cavity formed by TM2, TM3, TM4, the linker helix, and TM5 (Zhu2024Transport).

The SPX domain is essential for XPR1 function and binds to InsP8, a physiological activator, stabilizing the SPX domain (Zhu2024Transport). The protein's tertiary structure includes multiple substrate-binding sites and three gates: an intracellular gate, a gate within the substrate translocation pathway, and an extracellular gate likely formed by the TM9-10 loop (Zhu2024Transport).

## Function
The XPR1 gene encodes a protein that functions as a phosphate exporter in human cells, playing a crucial role in maintaining phosphate homeostasis. XPR1 is primarily active at the plasma membrane, where it facilitates the transport of phosphate ions out of the cell. This process is essential for regulating intracellular phosphate levels and ensuring proper cellular function (Wilson2019The; LópezSánchez2020Interplay).

The activity of XPR1 is intricately linked to inositol polyphosphates (PP-IPs), such as diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate (IP7) and diphosphoinositol tetrakisphosphate (IP8). These molecules interact with the SPX domain of XPR1, modulating its function and promoting phosphate efflux. This regulation is crucial for maintaining intracellular phosphate and ATP levels, which are vital for energy production and other cellular processes (Wilson2019The; LópezSánchez2020Interplay).

In the absence of XPR1, cells exhibit increased intracellular phosphate and ATP levels, indicating its role in balancing phosphate levels and energy metabolism. The presence of PP-IPs is necessary for XPR1's function, as their absence leads to decreased phosphate efflux, highlighting the importance of these signaling molecules in phosphate homeostasis (Wilson2019The; LópezSánchez2020Interplay).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the XPR1 gene are associated with primary familial brain calcification (PFBC), a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by calcium deposits in the brain, leading to symptoms such as movement disorders, cognitive impairment, and psychiatric issues (Yao2017Analysis; Anheim2016XPR1). The XPR1 gene encodes the only known inorganic phosphate exporter in metazoans, and its mutations can impair phosphate efflux, disrupting phosphate homeostasis in the brain (Tang2021Biallelic; LópezSánchez2019Characterization).

Specific mutations, such as p.L145P and p.L87P, have been linked to PFBC. The p.L145P mutation impairs phosphate efflux and reduces interaction with PDGFRB, potentially disrupting phosphate homeostasis (Yao2017Analysis). The p.L87P mutation results in a loss of XPR1 function, as it is not detected at the cell surface, leading to decreased phosphate export (Anheim2016XPR1). Other variants, such as p.R459C, p.N619D, and p.I629S, also impair phosphate export and are associated with various clinical manifestations, including parkinsonism and intellectual disability (LópezSánchez2019Characterization).

XPR1 mutations are considered a rare cause of PFBC, accounting for less than 8% of cases negative for other known genes (Anheim2016XPR1). The condition is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, although biallelic mutations have also been reported, suggesting a recessive inheritance pattern in some cases (Tang2021Biallelic).

## Interactions
XPR1 interacts with several proteins and is involved in various cellular processes. It forms a complex with the platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRB) on the cell membrane. This interaction is significant for maintaining phosphate homeostasis, and mutations in XPR1 can disrupt this interaction, potentially affecting phosphate regulation (Yao2017Analysis).

XPR1 also interacts with inositol pyrophosphates, particularly IP7 and InsP8, which bind to its SPX domain. This binding is crucial for regulating phosphate export. The interaction with IP7 is facilitated by inositol hexakisphosphate kinases (IP6K1 and IP6K2), which are responsible for synthesizing these pyrophosphates. The binding of IP7 to the SPX domain of XPR1 promotes phosphate export, highlighting the role of inositol pyrophosphates in phosphate homeostasis (Li2020Control; Wilson2019The).

Additionally, XPR1 is involved in interactions with retroviral proteins. It acts as a receptor for xenotropic and polytropic murine retroviruses, mediating their entry into cells. This interaction can disrupt G-protein signaling pathways, leading to changes in cellular cAMP levels and potentially inducing apoptosis (Vaughan2012Xpr1).
