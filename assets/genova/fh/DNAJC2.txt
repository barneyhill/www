# DNAJC2

## Overview
DNAJC2 is a gene that encodes the protein DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member C2, also known as ZRF1. This protein is a member of the J-domain protein (JDP) family, which plays a crucial role in protein folding and stress response by interacting with HSP70 proteins. DNAJC2 is involved in the regulation of gene expression, particularly through its role in chromatin remodeling. It binds to ubiquitinated histone H2A, facilitating the displacement of the polycomb-repressive complex 1 (PRC1) from chromatin, thereby activating transcription. This function is significant in processes related to stemness, development, and differentiation. Additionally, DNAJC2 is implicated in maintaining protein homeostasis and cellular stability, contributing to developmental robustness against environmental or genetic perturbations. The gene's expression and interactions have been linked to various cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Liu2021DNAJC2; Hughes2019DnaJ; Kaida2021Regulation).

## Structure
DNAJC2, also known as ZRF1, is a member of the DNAJ heat shock protein family, specifically classified under the DNAJC class. The protein is characterized by the presence of a J-domain, which is approximately 70 amino acids long and consists of four alpha helices and an accessible loop containing a Histidine Proline Aspartate (HPD) motif crucial for binding to HSP70 proteins (Dekker2015DNAJs:). This J-domain is essential for stimulating the ATPase activity of HSP70, facilitating protein folding and stress response (Kaida2021Regulation).

DNAJC2 is homologous to the yeast protein Zuo1, part of the Ribosome Associated Complex (RAC), which is involved in the folding of nascent polypeptides emerging from the ribosome (Dekker2015DNAJs:). The protein forms a complex with HSP70 and acts as an epigenetic gene transcription regulator, binding to ubiquitinated histone H2A and displacing the polycomb-repressive complex 1 (PRC1) from chromatin, leading to transcriptional activation (Kaida2021Regulation).

While specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of DNAJC2 are not provided, the presence of the J-domain and its functional interactions with HSP70 are well-documented (Dekker2015DNAJs:; Kaida2021Regulation). There is no mention of post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms in the available context.

## Function
DNAJC2, also known as Zuotin-Related Factor 1 (ZRF1), is a human ribosome-associated J-domain protein (JDP) that plays a significant role in gene expression regulation by modifying chromatin structure. It forms a complex with HSP70 and is involved in the transcriptional regulation of genes related to stemness, development, and differentiation. Mechanistically, DNAJC2 binds to ubiquitinated histone H2A, displacing the polycomb-repressive complex 1 (PRC1) from chromatin, which leads to transcriptional activation (Kaida2021Regulation).

In addition to its role in gene transcription, DNAJC2 is involved in the folding of nascent proteins, which is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis and proper cellular function. This function is part of its broader role in canalization, contributing to the robustness of development against environmental or genetic perturbations (Hughes2019DnaJ). DNAJC2 is expressed in various tissues, including seam cells and anal depressor muscles, suggesting its role as a genetic modifier within a complex gene network (Hughes2019DnaJ). These activities highlight DNAJC2's importance in maintaining cellular stability and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
DNAJC2 has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), DNAJC2 is upregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and its expression is associated with increased tumor size. It promotes CRC cell proliferation by influencing cell cycle regulators such as cyclin D1 and CDK2, and is negatively regulated by miR-672-3p through the AKT/P21 signaling pathway (Liu2021DNAJC2). In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), mutations in DNAJC2 are significantly associated with reduced overall survival and increased relapse rates, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Cho2018Association).

In acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) and gastric cancer, DNAJC2, also known as ZRF1, is overexpressed and contributes to oncogenic processes. In AML, its depletion leads to decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis, possibly through interactions with the retinoic acid receptor α (Kaida2021Regulation). In gastric cancer, DNAJC2/ZRF1's oncogenic role may depend on the presence of wild-type p53, as its knockdown in such cells inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis (Kaida2021Regulation). These findings highlight DNAJC2's role in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
DNAJC2, also known as ZRF1, is a human ribosome-associated J-domain protein (JDP) that forms a complex with HSP70, playing a significant role in protein folding and stress response. It is involved in the regulation of gene transcription by binding to ubiquitinated histone H2A and displacing the polycomb-repressive complex 1 (PRC1) from chromatin, which leads to transcriptional activation (Kaida2021Regulation). 

In the context of cancer, DNAJC2/ZRF1 interacts with the retinoic acid receptor α (RARα), and its function appears to be dependent on the presence of wild-type p53 (wtp53). In human gastric cancer cell lines with wtp53, DNAJC2/ZRF1 knockdown inhibits cell proliferation and migration, induces apoptosis, and increases p21 levels, suggesting that DNAJC2/ZRF1 may inhibit wtp53 function to promote cancer progression (Kaida2021Regulation).

DNAJC2 is also implicated in developmental robustness, interacting with nascent polypeptides during translation as part of a complex gene network that contributes to canalization, the robustness of development against environmental or genetic perturbations (Hughes2019DnaJ). These interactions highlight DNAJC2's multifaceted role in cellular processes, including its involvement in protein folding and gene regulation.
