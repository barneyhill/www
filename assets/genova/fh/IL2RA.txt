# IL2RA

## Overview
The IL2RA gene encodes the interleukin-2 receptor subunit alpha (CD25), a critical component of the high-affinity interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor complex, which plays a pivotal role in the immune system. This receptor is a transmembrane protein that, in conjunction with the IL-2 receptor beta (IL2RB) and the common gamma chain (IL2RG), forms a receptor complex essential for IL-2 signaling, which is crucial for T-cell proliferation and activation (Waldmann1991The; Anderson1995Functional). The IL2RA subunit itself binds IL-2 with low affinity but is indispensable for the formation of the high-affinity receptor complex, enhancing the binding and signaling capabilities of the receptor (Grant1992The). The expression of IL2RA is tightly regulated, being absent on resting T and B cells but rapidly induced upon antigenic stimulation, thus serving as a key regulatory element in immune responses (Richardson1995Phenotypic). Alterations in the IL2RA gene are associated with various autoimmune diseases and immune dysregulation conditions, highlighting its clinical significance (Joosse2021Duplication).

## Structure
The IL2RA protein, also known as CD25, is a component of the high-affinity interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor complex. Structurally, IL2RA is composed of two 'sushi-like' domains, D1 and D2, which form a unique 1-on-4 beta-sandwich structure, deviating from the typical 2-on-3 sushi domain structure (Rickert2005The). These domains are connected by a 42-residue interdomain linker peptide, which does not contribute to ligand binding and is not visible in the electron density map (Rickert2005The). The D1 domain interacts with IL-2 through hydrophobic ridges, involving residues such as Phe 42 and Tyr 45, which insert into grooves between IL2RA beta strands (Wang2005Structure).

The IL2RA protein is part of a quaternary complex with IL-2, IL-2Rb, and the common gamma chain (γc), forming a Y-shaped structure where IL-2 binds in the fork (Wang2005Structure). This complex is stabilized by multiple binding sites, enhancing the binding affinity of IL-2 to IL-2Rb (Wang2005Structure). IL2RA is not expressed on resting T and B cells but is continuously expressed by abnormal T cells in certain diseases, making it a target for therapeutic modulation (Rickert2005The). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which is crucial for its stability and function.

## Function
The IL2RA gene encodes the interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain, a critical component of the high-affinity IL-2 receptor complex. This receptor is essential for the immune response, particularly in T-cell proliferation and activation. The IL-2 receptor is composed of three subunits: IL-2Ra, IL-2Rβ, and IL-2Rγ. The IL-2Ra subunit, also known as CD25, is a 55-kDa glycoprotein that binds IL-2 with low affinity on its own but is crucial for forming the high-affinity receptor complex when combined with the beta and gamma subunits (Waldmann1991The; Anderson1995Functional).

In healthy human cells, IL-2Ra is not typically expressed on resting T cells but is rapidly induced upon antigenic stimulation, leading to its expression on activated T and B lymphocytes. This expression is a key regulatory point in the T-cell response to antigens (Waldmann1991The; Richardson1995Phenotypic). The IL-2Ra subunit enhances IL-2 binding and signaling through IL-2Rβ, even without direct IL-2 binding to IL-2Ra, indicating its role in modulating receptor function and signaling pathways (Grant1992The). This modulation is vital for the clonal expansion of T cells, which is essential for an effective immune response (Taniguchi1993The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IL2RA gene, which encodes the interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain (CD25), are associated with various autoimmune diseases and immune dysregulation conditions. Duplication of the IL2RA locus can lead to excessive IL-2 signaling, predisposing individuals to colonic inflammation and conditions like very early onset colitis. This is characterized by increased CD25 expression on activated CD4+ T cells, leading to excessive stimulation and inflammation in the colon (Joosse2021Duplication).

Conversely, mutations that result in CD25 deficiency can cause severe autoimmune conditions and chronic infections. This deficiency is marked by pronounced lymphoproliferation, particularly of CD8+ T cells, and increased T cell activation markers, despite the presence of regulatory T cells (Goudy2013Human). Such mutations can lead to conditions resembling Immune dysregulation, Polyendocrinopathy, Enteropathy, X-linked (IPEX) syndrome, characterized by immune dysregulation and increased susceptibility to infections (Goudy2013Human).

Polymorphisms in the IL2RA gene are linked to autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. These genetic variations can influence disease susceptibility and the production of soluble IL-2RA, affecting immune tolerance and regulatory T cell homeostasis (Carr2009Contrasting).

## Interactions
IL2RA, also known as CD25, is a component of the high-affinity interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor complex, which also includes IL2RB (CD122) and IL2RG (CD132). This receptor complex is crucial for IL-2 signaling in immune responses. IL2RA interacts with IL-2 through a unique docking mode, forming a large hydrophobic core that stabilizes the interaction. This interaction involves the burial of 20 IL-2 residues and 21 IL2RA residues, creating a rigid structure essential for binding (Rickert2005The).

IL2RA can form heterotetrameric structures with IL-15Rα, sharing signaling subunits, which suggests a mechanism for subunit sharing among cytokine receptors. This interaction is observed in membrane domains and is associated with lipid rafts, which are involved in signaling (Bodnár2008A). IL2RA also interacts with MHC I and II glycoproteins, ICAM-1, and CD48, forming part of a larger supramolecular cluster. These interactions are stabilized by specific protein-protein interactions (Bodnár2008A).

The IL2RA subunit enhances IL-2 binding and signaling by altering the function of the β subunit, even without direct binding of IL-2 to the α subunit. This suggests that IL2RA plays a role in preassembling the receptor complex in the membrane (Bodnár2008A).
