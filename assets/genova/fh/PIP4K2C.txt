# PIP4K2C

## Overview
PIP4K2C is a gene that encodes the enzyme phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate 4-kinase type 2 gamma (PI5P4Kγ), a member of the kinase family involved in lipid signaling pathways. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate (PI5P) to generate phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), a critical component in cellular signaling processes. PI5P4Kγ is integral to the regulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway, which is essential for cell growth, metabolism, and immune homeostasis (Shim2016Deletion). The protein is localized in various cellular compartments, including the Golgi apparatus, and is involved in membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal organization (Clarke2008Localization; Mackey2014PIP4kγ). PI5P4Kγ's interactions with other proteins, such as WDR73, further underscore its role in cellular architecture and signaling (Li2022WDR73). The gene's expression and function have significant implications in various diseases, including acute myeloid leukemia and cardiac conditions, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Lima2019PIP4K2A; Magadum2021Therapeutic).

## Function
PIP4K2C encodes the enzyme phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate 4-kinase type 2 gamma (PI5P4Kγ), which is involved in the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate (PI5P) to produce phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2). This enzyme plays a crucial role in cellular signaling, particularly in the regulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway. mTORC1 is a central regulator of cell growth, survival, and metabolism, and PI5P4Kγ is thought to negatively regulate this pathway. In healthy cells, PI5P4Kγ helps maintain immune homeostasis by modulating mTORC1 activity, which is essential for proper T-cell differentiation and activation (Shim2016Deletion).

PI5P4Kγ is also involved in membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal organization. It is localized in various cellular compartments, including the Golgi apparatus and vesicular structures, suggesting a role in intracellular membrane trafficking and actin cytoskeleton restructuring (Clarke2008Localization; Mackey2014PIP4kγ). The enzyme's activity is regulated by its phosphorylation state, which influences its ability to modulate mTORC1 signaling, particularly during nutrient starvation (Mackey2014PIP4kγ). PI5P4Kγ's interaction with other proteins, such as WDR73, further implicates it in focal adhesion formation and actin cytoskeleton regulation (Li2022WDR73).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PIP4K2C gene have been implicated in several diseases. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), high expression of PIP4K2C is associated with genomic instability and poor survival outcomes. This high expression correlates with cytogenetic abnormalities and a higher frequency of TP53 mutations, which are linked to poor prognosis in AML patients (Lima2019PIP4K2A). Conversely, lower levels of PIP4K2C expression are associated with better clinical outcomes in AML, particularly in patients classified under the favorable risk group (Lima2019PIP4K2A).

PIP4K2C also plays a role in cardiac diseases. It is significantly downregulated in patients with cardiac hypertrophy (CH) and heart failure (HF). In mouse models, deletion of Pip4k2c leads to increased cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and reduced survival, suggesting its protective role in cardiac function. Therapeutic delivery of Pip4k2c-modified mRNA has been shown to improve heart function and survival in these models, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target for heart diseases characterized by hypertrophy and fibrosis (Magadum2021Therapeutic).

In the context of viral infections, PIP4K2C is involved in the replication of RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Inhibition of PIP4K2C can reverse virus-induced impairment of autophagic flux, suggesting its potential as a druggable target for antiviral strategies (Karim2024PIP4K2C).

## Interactions
PIP4K2C, or phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate 4-kinase type 2 gamma, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. PIP4K2C interacts with WDR73, a protein implicated in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton pathway. This interaction was confirmed through a GST pulldown assay, demonstrating that GST-tagged PIP4K2C can pull down His-tagged WDR73, indicating a direct interaction (Li2022WDR73). The interaction between PIP4K2C and WDR73 is crucial for the stability of PIP4K2C, as WDR73 depletion leads to its destabilization and degradation via the autophagy-lysosome pathway (Li2022WDR73).

PIP4K2C also interacts with SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural proteins NSP3 and NSP6, as shown in protein-fragment complementation assays. This interaction suggests that PIP4K2C is recruited by the virus to regulate autophagic flux during infection (Karim2024PIP4K2C). Additionally, PIP4K2C forms heterodimeric complexes with PI5P4Kα and PI5P4Kβ, which are more active enzymes, indicating a regulatory role in their localization and activity (Shim2016Deletion). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of PIP4K2C in cellular signaling and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.
