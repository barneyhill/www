# ELANE

## Overview
The ELANE gene encodes neutrophil elastase, a serine protease predominantly expressed in neutrophils, which are a type of white blood cell integral to the innate immune system. Neutrophil elastase plays a critical role in host defense by degrading proteins and pathogens engulfed by neutrophils during phagocytosis, thus facilitating the breakdown of bacteria and other foreign particles (Nasri2019CRISPRCas9mediated). Structurally, neutrophil elastase is characterized by a catalytic triad and a compact, globular form stabilized by disulfide bonds, which are essential for its proteolytic activity (Korkmaz2010Neutrophil). The enzyme is stored in azurophilic granules and becomes active upon cleavage of an N-terminal propeptide (Nayak2015Pathogenesis). Mutations in the ELANE gene are associated with disorders such as cyclic neutropenia and severe congenital neutropenia, which are linked to impaired neutrophil function and increased susceptibility to infections (Newburger2010Cyclic; Makaryan2015The).

## Structure
Neutrophil elastase, encoded by the ELANE gene, is a serine protease with a well-defined molecular structure. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain, which is synthesized as an inactive prepro-protein. This precursor includes a signal peptide and an amino-terminal prodipeptide, which are cleaved during activation (Korkmaz2010Neutrophil).

The secondary structure of neutrophil elastase includes two homologous β-barrels and a C-terminal α-helix. The catalytic triad, comprising Ser195, Asp102, and His57, is located at the junction of these β-barrels, facilitating the nucleophilic attack necessary for its proteolytic activity (Schuhmann2022The; Korkmaz2010Neutrophil).

In terms of tertiary structure, neutrophil elastase has a compact, globular form stabilized by disulfide bonds. The S1 pocket, crucial for substrate specificity, is hemispherical and hydrophobic, accommodating small hydrophobic residues (Korkmaz2010Neutrophil).

Neutrophil elastase can form quaternary structures through interactions with other proteins, although specific details on these interactions are not extensively covered in the provided context. Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, may occur, and splice variants can lead to different isoforms with distinct functions (Voynow2021Neutrophil).

## Function
The ELANE gene encodes neutrophil elastase (NE), a serine protease primarily expressed in neutrophils, a type of white blood cell. In healthy human cells, neutrophil elastase is involved in the innate immune response by degrading various proteins and pathogens engulfed by neutrophils during phagocytosis. This process is crucial for the breakdown of bacteria and other foreign particles, contributing to the body's defense mechanisms (Nasri2019CRISPRCas9mediated). Neutrophil elastase is stored in azurophilic granules within neutrophils and becomes catalytically active after the removal of an N-terminal propeptide following granule targeting (Nayak2015Pathogenesis).

Neutrophil elastase plays a significant role in granulopoiesis, the formation of granulocytes, by regulating the expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPα), a crucial transcription factor for granulocyte development (Nayak2015Pathogenesis). It is also involved in processes such as phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species production, and chemotaxis, which are essential for the immune response (Nasri2019CRISPRCas9mediated). The enzyme's activity is essential for maintaining immune system balance and effective pathogen clearance, highlighting its critical role in both cellular and organismal immune functions (Ye2011Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ELANE gene, which encodes neutrophil elastase, are associated with two primary conditions: cyclic neutropenia (CyN) and severe congenital neutropenia (SCN). CyN is characterized by regular oscillations in neutrophil counts, leading to periodic episodes of neutropenia and associated infections. It is an autosomal dominant disorder that can be sporadic or inherited and is generally responsive to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) treatment (Lao2022Case; Newburger2010Cyclic). SCN is a more severe condition with consistently low neutrophil counts, leading to recurrent severe infections from early life. It carries a risk of progression to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Skokowa2017Severe; Makaryan2015The).

The pathogenesis of these conditions is linked to the dysfunction of neutrophil elastase due to ELANE mutations, which can lead to mislocalization of the enzyme, impaired neutrophil maturation, and increased apoptosis of neutrophil precursors (Lao2022Case; Rydzynska2021Neutrophil). Specific mutations, such as p.Gly214Arg, are associated with a higher risk of leukemic transformation and poor treatment response (Makaryan2015The; Rydzynska2021Neutrophil). The unfolded protein response (UPR) is also implicated in the pathogenesis, with different ELANE mutants activating various UPR pathways, potentially leading to maturation arrest in granulopoiesis (Nustede2015ELANE).

## Interactions
The ELANE protein, also known as neutrophil elastase, participates in several significant interactions with other proteins. In the context of breast cancer metastasis, ELANE interacts with CSF3 in the brain metastasis sub-network and switches its interaction partner to VCAM1 in the lung metastasis sub-network. These interactions are crucial as CSF3 and VCAM1 are seed genes in their respective networks, influencing metastasis progression in breast cancer patients (Engin2013Integrating).

In the immune system, ELANE is involved in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and can degrade various extracellular proteins, including elastin, laminin, and transmembrane proteins. It also degrades the insulin receptor substrate 1, activating the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase-protein kinase B signaling pathway, which promotes tumor cell proliferation (Jia2023Neutrophil).

ELANE also plays a role in the pathogenesis of severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) through its mislocalization, which triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, affecting granulocyte differentiation and survival (Nayak2015Pathogenesis). The protein interacts with ER chaperones like BIP, contributing to these cellular stress responses (Nayak2015Pathogenesis).
