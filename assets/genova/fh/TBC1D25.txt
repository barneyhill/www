# TBC1D25

## Overview
TBC1D25 is a gene that encodes the protein TBC1 domain family member 25, also known as OATL1. This protein is characterized by the presence of a TBC (Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16) domain, which classifies it as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rab GTPases, specifically Rab33B. TBC1D25 plays a significant role in the regulation of autophagy and osteoclast activity, contributing to cellular homeostasis and bone resorption. The protein is involved in the maturation of autophagosomes by interacting with Atg8 homologues and is localized to autophagosomal membranes, where it regulates the conversion of autophagosomes to autolysosomes. Additionally, TBC1D25 is expressed in osteoclasts, where it influences bone resorption processes. Its interactions with proteins such as LC3 and GABARAP are crucial for its function, and alterations in its expression have been linked to diseases like Paget's disease of bone and melanoma (Hirano2016Differing; Fukuda2011TBC; Roy2021RabGAP).

## Structure
TBC1D25, also known as OATL1, is a protein that features a TBC (Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16) domain, which is crucial for its function as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rab GTPases (Fukuda2011TBC). The protein contains an N-terminal PB1-like domain and an LC3-interacting region (LRS), which are important for its interaction with the autophagic machinery (Hirano2016Differing). The PB1-like domain of TBC1D25 lacks a conserved Lys residue and acidic residues, which are typically involved in PB1-PB1 interactions, suggesting weaker oligomerization activity compared to similar proteins like SQSTM1/p62 (Hirano2016Differing). This weak oligomerization is a key factor in its exclusion from autophagic degradation (Hirano2016Differing).

The molecular structure of TBC1D25 includes a TBC-RAB-GAP domain, an LRS, and a PB1-like domain, which may influence its interaction with autophagic machinery (Hirano2016Differing). The protein is predominantly localized at the outer autophagosomal membrane, which may help it escape autophagic degradation (Hirano2016Differing). The study of TBC1D25 also involves creating various mutants to investigate its interactions and functions (Hirano2016Differing).

## Function
TBC1D25, also known as OATL1, is a protein involved in the regulation of autophagy and osteoclast activity in human cells. It functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rab33B, a Golgi-resident Rab protein, and plays a crucial role in autophagosomal maturation by interacting with Atg8 homologues. TBC1D25 is localized to Atg8-decorated isolation membranes and autophagosomes, where it inhibits the conversion from autophagosomes to autolysosomes, thus regulating the maturation process of autophagosomes (Hirano2016Differing; Itoh2011OATL1).

In osteoclasts, TBC1D25 is expressed at the sealing zone and ruffled membrane, which are essential for bone resorption. It is involved in the remodeling of the bone-facing plasma membrane and promotes bone resorption by interacting with an unknown Rab protein. Inhibition of TBC1D25 expression leads to decreased bone resorption and affects the multinucleation of osteoclasts, indicating its role in osteoclast polarization and function (Roy2021RabGAP).

Overall, TBC1D25 is integral to both autophagic processes and bone resorption, highlighting its importance in cellular homeostasis and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
TBC1D25, also known as OATL1, has been implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression and interactions. In Paget's disease of bone (PDB), TBC1D25 is suggested to play a role due to its involvement in autophagy dysregulation, a process implicated in the pathogenesis of PDB. The expression of TBC1D25 is significantly modified in osteoclasts from PDB patients compared to controls, indicating its potential contribution to the disease phenotype (Klinck2014Alternative).

In melanoma, TBC1D25 shows decreased mRNA expression levels in skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) compared to normal tissues. This alteration in expression suggests that TBC1D25 may serve as a prognostic marker in melanoma, although specific clinical associations are still under investigation (Tang2020Tre2Bub2Cdc16).

The protein's interaction with LC3, a key player in autophagosome formation, is notable. Unlike other LC3-binding proteins, TBC1D25 is not degraded by autophagy due to its lack of oligomerization ability, which allows it to escape degradation. This unique interaction may influence its role in cellular processes and potentially impact disease states where autophagy is involved (Hirano2016Differing).

## Interactions
TBC1D25, also known as OATL1, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It interacts with LC3, a protein associated with autophagy, and this interaction is significant for the maturation of autophagosomes. TBC1D25 is identified as a novel LC3-binding protein, and its interaction with LC3 is mediated through an LC3 recognition sequence (LRS) (Hirano2016Differing). Despite its binding to LC3, TBC1D25 is not typically degraded by autophagy, unlike other LC3-binding proteins such as SQSTM1/p62. This resistance to degradation is attributed to its weaker oligomerization ability, which is a result of its PB1-like domain lacking certain residues necessary for strong interactions (Hirano2016Differing).

TBC1D25 also interacts with GABARAP, another autophagy-related protein, and this interaction is disrupted by specific missense variants, which may contribute to conditions like oligozoospermia (Nawaz2021First). In osteoclasts, TBC1D25 co-localizes with actin at the sealing zone, indicating a role in bone resorption processes. It also shows colocalization with cathepsin K, a major bone-degrading enzyme, suggesting its involvement in the regulation of vesicle trafficking and bone resorption (Roy2021RabGAP).
