# ITPK1

## Overview
Inositol-tetrakisphosphate 1-kinase (ITPK1) is a gene that encodes a kinase enzyme involved in the phosphorylation of inositol phosphates, which are critical components of cellular signaling pathways. The enzyme, inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate 5/6-kinase, plays a pivotal role in converting inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate into more phosphorylated forms, such as inositol tetrakisphosphate and pentakisphosphate, which are essential for various cellular processes including mRNA export, transcription regulation, and calcium signaling (Zhang2012Regulation; Majerus2010Expression). ITPK1 is regulated by post-translational modifications, such as acetylation, which influence its stability and activity (Zhang2012Regulation). The enzyme is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, impacting physiological functions like cell growth and apoptosis (Zhang2012Regulation). Clinically, ITPK1 has been associated with the modulation of cystic fibrosis severity and necroptosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Shears2009Molecular; Dovey2018MLKL).

## Structure
The human ITPK1 protein is characterized by a catalytic domain defined up to residue 335, with a small dimer interface formed by the C-terminal residues, although it is monomeric in solution (Chamberlain2007Integration). The protein's structure includes an ATP binding site with an ATP-grasp fold, featuring two sets of four-stranded anti-parallel β-sheets. Two Mn2+ ions are present in the active site, coordinated by specific residues, and are structurally equivalent to Mg2+ ions in its Entamoeba histolytica homologue (Chamberlain2007Integration).

The inositol phosphate binding site of ITPK1 is a strongly electropositive cleft, composed of residues from specific helices and loop regions, allowing for greater substrate discrimination compared to its homologues (Chamberlain2007Integration). The structure of ITPK1 also includes a 310 helix that offers additional interactions with the bound nucleotide, which are not conserved in its homologues (Chamberlain2007Integration).

Post-translational modifications of ITPK1 include acetylation at lysine residues 340, 383, and 410, which affects the protein's stability and enzymatic activity (Zhang2012Regulation). These modifications are reversible, with acetylation mediated by acetyltransferases such as CBP and p300, and deacetylation facilitated by SIRT1 (Zhang2012Regulation).

## Function
The ITPK1 gene encodes the enzyme inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate 5/6-kinase, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of inositol phosphate signaling pathways in human cells. This enzyme is involved in the phosphorylation of inositol phosphates, specifically converting inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4)P3) into inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,5)P4) or inositol 1,3,4,6-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,6)P4) (Majerus2010Expression). ITPK1 also catalyzes the formation of higher phosphorylated forms of inositol, such as inositol pentakisphosphate (IP5) and inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6), which are involved in various cellular processes including mRNA export, transcription regulation, and ATPase activity enhancement (Zhang2012Regulation; Majerus2010Expression).

The enzyme's activity is regulated by posttranslational modifications, such as acetylation, which can decrease its stability and enzymatic activity, leading to reduced synthesis of higher phosphorylated inositol forms (Zhang2012Regulation). ITPK1 is active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing physiological functions like calcium signaling, cell growth, and apoptosis (Zhang2012Regulation). Its role in regulating chloride channel activity is significant for processes such as fluid secretion and neurotransmission (Chamberlain2007Integration).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ITPK1 gene have been linked to the severity of cystic fibrosis (CF). ITPK1 regulates the levels of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4, which in turn affects the activity of Ca2+-activated Cl- channels. These channels are crucial for salt and fluid secretion in epithelial cells. In CF, variations in ITPK1 expression can influence the effectiveness of therapies, such as Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 antagonists or purinergic agonists, depending on the patient's specific expression levels of ITPK1 (Shears2009Molecular; Yang2006Apical).

ITPK1 is also implicated in necroptosis, a form of programmed cell death. Studies have shown that ITPK1 is essential for necroptosis, as its disruption confers resistance to this process in certain cell types. This suggests a critical role for ITPK1 in the necroptotic pathway, although specific diseases directly linked to ITPK1 mutations in this context have not been detailed (Dovey2018MLKL).

The gene's expression and function as a modifier in CF highlight its potential as a therapeutic target or biomarker, influencing disease phenotype and treatment outcomes (Yang2006Apical).

## Interactions
The human gene ITPK1 encodes the enzyme inositol-tetrakisphosphate 1-kinase, which is involved in the phosphorylation of inositol phosphates. ITPK1 participates in several interactions with other proteins that regulate its activity and function. It is acetylated by the transcriptional coactivators CBP and p300, which possess histone-acetyltransferase activity. This acetylation occurs at lysine residues K340, K383, and K410, as identified through mass spectrometry. The acetylation of ITPK1 affects its stability and enzymatic activity, leading to reduced levels of higher phosphorylated inositol forms (Zhang2012Regulation). 

ITPK1 is also subject to deacetylation by SIRT1, a class III histone deacetylase. The presence of SIRT1 reduces the acetylation of ITPK1, and this deacetylation process can be inhibited by TSA and Nia, which are inhibitors of deacetylase activities (Zhang2012Regulation). These interactions highlight the regulatory mechanisms controlling ITPK1 activity through reversible acetylation and deacetylation processes. While the context does not provide specific details on interactions with nucleic acids or multiprotein complexes, the regulation of ITPK1 through these protein interactions is crucial for its role in inositol phosphate metabolism.
