# ZNF556

## Overview
ZNF556 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 556, a member of the Krüppel-type zinc finger protein family. This protein is characterized by the presence of C2H2 zinc finger motifs, which are essential for DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. The zinc finger protein 556 also contains a KRAB domain, which plays a significant role in transcriptional repression through chromatin remodeling. The protein's function is context-dependent, with its expression levels linked to various medical conditions, including cancer and male fertility disorders. In particular, ZNF556 has been associated with poor prognosis in colon cancer and is implicated in non-obstructive azoospermia, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for disease prognosis and therapy response (Karoii2024Whole; Liu2020Transcription; Céspedes2024Utilização).

## Structure
The ZNF556 gene encodes a member of the zinc finger protein family, specifically the Krüppel-type zinc finger proteins. These proteins are characterized by the presence of C2H2 zinc finger motifs, which consist of 28 to 30 amino acid residues. These motifs are stabilized by a zinc ion coordinated by two cysteines and two histidines, forming a stable folded structure that includes two to three beta strands and an alpha helix. The alpha helix is crucial for DNA binding, interacting with three adjacent DNA bases through non-covalent interactions (Céspedes2024Utilização).

ZNF556 also contains a KRAB domain at the amino terminal, which is involved in protein-protein interactions and can influence subcellular localization, DNA binding, and gene expression. The KRAB domain is known for its role in transcriptional repression through chromatin remodeling interactions (Céspedes2024Utilização). The molecular structure of ZNF556, with its zinc finger motifs and KRAB domain, suggests its involvement in DNA and potentially RNA binding, as well as its role in transcriptional regulation (Céspedes2024Utilização). The protein's function is context-dependent, and its expression levels have been linked to cancer prognosis, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer (Céspedes2024Utilização).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZNF556 has been implicated in several medical conditions through alterations in its expression levels. In non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA), a condition affecting male fertility, ZNF556 is up-regulated, suggesting a potential association with the disorder. The study identified ZNF556 as one of the differentially expressed genes in NOA cases, indicating its possible role in the pathophysiology of this condition (Karoii2024Whole).

In the context of cancer, ZNF556 has been identified as a key transcription factor in a predictive model for colon cancer prognosis. The model, which includes ZNF556 among other transcription factors, indicates that higher expression levels of ZNF556 are associated with a poorer prognosis in colon cancer patients. This suggests that ZNF556 may be involved in cancer-related pathways such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cell adhesion, contributing to adverse survival outcomes (Liu2020Transcription).

ZNF556 has also been noted for its high expression in patients with no change in response to eradication therapy for Helicobacter pylori-negative gastric MALT lymphoma, indicating its potential as a predictive marker for therapy response (Takigawa2023Comprehensive). However, specific diseases or conditions directly resulting from mutations in ZNF556 have not been detailed in the available studies.
