# ZNF124

## Overview
ZNF124 is a human gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 124, a transcription factor involved in the regulation of gene expression. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger motifs, which facilitate binding to specific DNA sequences, thereby modulating the transcription of target genes. Zinc finger protein 124 is primarily localized in the nucleus and plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. The gene is expressed in several tissues, such as the placenta, skeletal muscle, and pancreas, indicating its role in tissue-specific gene regulation and cellular differentiation. ZNF124 is located on chromosome 11q, a region prone to translocations associated with hereditary and malignant diseases, underscoring its importance in maintaining genomic stability (Saleh1992Isolation).

## Structure


## Function
ZNF124, also known as zinc finger protein 124, is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in regulating gene expression in human cells. It is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which enable it to bind to specific DNA sequences and modulate the transcription of target genes. This protein is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences the transcriptional landscape of the cell, impacting various cellular processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (Saleh1992Isolation).

In healthy human cells, ZNF124 is expressed in tissues such as the placenta, skeletal muscle, and pancreas, suggesting its involvement in tissue-specific gene regulation and cellular differentiation (Saleh1992Isolation). The expression pattern of ZNF124 indicates its potential role in fundamental cellular processes, possibly contributing to the maintenance of normal cellular functions and homeostasis. The chromosomal localization of ZNF124 on human chromosome 11q is noteworthy due to the frequent occurrence of chromosome translocations in this region, which are associated with various hereditary and malignant diseases (Saleh1992Isolation). This highlights the importance of ZNF124 in maintaining genomic stability and its potential implications in disease states when dysregulated.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF124 has been implicated in several aggressive cancers due to its role in transcriptional regulation. In group 3 medulloblastomas (G3-MBs), a highly aggressive form of brain tumor, ZNF124 is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis. Knockdown studies in G3-MB cell lines have shown that reducing ZNF124 expression leads to decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis, suggesting its role in promoting tumor growth and survival. This makes ZNF124 a potential target for therapeutic intervention in G3-MBs (Luo2021Genomic).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a circular RNA derived from ZNF124, known as circ_ZNF124, is highly expressed and contributes to cancer progression. Circ_ZNF124 acts as a competing endogenous RNA, inhibiting miR-337-3p and thereby preventing the downregulation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, which is crucial for cancer cell proliferation. Silencing circ_ZNF124 results in cell cycle arrest and reduced growth rates in NSCLC cell lines, indicating its oncogenic role (Li2019CircZNF124).

In endometrial cancer, circZNF124 is also upregulated and associated with disease severity. It regulates cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by interacting with miR-199b-5p and modulating the expression of SLC7A5, a gene involved in leucine uptake and tumor growth (Shu2021CircZNF124).
