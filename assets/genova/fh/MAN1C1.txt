# MAN1C1

## Overview
The MAN1C1 gene encodes the protein mannosidase alpha class 1C member 1, which is a critical enzyme involved in the processing of N-glycans within the Golgi apparatus. This enzyme is categorized as a glycosidase, a type of enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds in carbohydrates. MAN1C1 plays a significant role in the maturation and function of glycoproteins, impacting various cellular processes such as cell migration and immune interactions. In particular, it is involved in the glycosylation of key proteins like CD147, influencing cellular signaling pathways and interactions within the tumor microenvironment. The expression of MAN1C1 has been linked to the progression of certain cancers, including gliomas, where it may serve as a biomarker for prognosis and a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Batara2024Elevated; GonzalezAndrades2020Golgi).

## Clinical Significance
The MAN1C1 gene is implicated in the progression and prognosis of gliomas, particularly glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Elevated expression of MAN1C1 is associated with poor outcomes in glioma patients and is notably high in glioma stem cells (GSCs) and the mesenchymal (MES) subtype of GBM, which is linked to the worst prognosis among GBM subtypes (Batara2024Elevated). MAN1C1 expression influences the tumor microenvironment by promoting immune cell infiltration and interactions with myeloid/microglial cells, potentially facilitating immune evasion and contributing to an anti-inflammatory environment (Batara2024Elevated).

High MAN1C1 expression is correlated with increased infiltration of immunosuppressive cells, such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and M2 tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which may hinder the effectiveness of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies, particularly anti-PD-1 treatments (Batara2024Elevated). A MAN1C1-based immune prognostic risk model has been developed, showing that high MAN1C1 expression is an independent predictor of poor overall survival in glioma patients (Batara2024Elevated). These findings suggest that MAN1C1 could serve as a predictive biomarker and a potential target for developing immunotherapies for GBM (Batara2024Elevated).

## Interactions
MAN1C1, or mannosidase alpha class 1C member 1, is involved in the processing of N-glycans, which is crucial for the proper function and localization of glycoproteins. In glioma cells, MAN1C1 expression is associated with interactions within the tumor microenvironment, particularly with myeloid and microglial cells. These interactions are facilitated by secreted signals such as PTN, MIF, ANXA1, MDK, and NAMPT, and are supported by glycosylated receptors like CD44 and integrins (ITGB1, ITGAV, ITGA8, ITGAB1) on the surface of glioma cells (Batara2024Elevated).

In epithelial cells, MAN1C1 plays a role in the glycosylation and function of CD147, a transmembrane protein involved in cell migration. MAN1C1 facilitates the interaction between CD147 and galectin-3, a carbohydrate-binding protein, which is essential for CD147 clustering and the subsequent expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9). Inhibition of MAN1C1 disrupts this interaction, impairing CD147 glycosylation and reducing MMP9 expression, which is critical for epithelial cell migration and wound healing (GonzalezAndrades2020Golgi). These interactions highlight the role of MAN1C1 in modulating cellular processes through its influence on glycoprotein function and cell signaling pathways.
