# ZMYM2

## Overview
ZMYM2 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger MYM-type containing 2 protein, a transcriptional regulator involved in various cellular processes. The protein is characterized by MYM-type zinc finger domains, which facilitate DNA binding and protein-protein interactions, playing a crucial role in transcriptional repression and chromatin regulation (AguilarMartinez2015Screen; Cibis2020Characterization). ZMYM2 is a component of several multiprotein complexes, including the CoREST transcriptional corepressor complex, and is involved in maintaining genomic stability by repressing transposable elements (Owen2023ZMYM2). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications such as SUMOylation and phosphorylation, which are essential for its function and interactions with other proteins (AguilarMartinez2015Screen; Lezmi2020The). ZMYM2's clinical significance is highlighted by its association with congenital anomalies, cancer, and neurodevelopmental disorders, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Owen2023ZMYM2; Mojarad2021Genome).

## Structure
ZMYM2 is a protein characterized by the presence of MYM-type zinc finger domains, which are crucial for its role in DNA binding and protein-protein interactions (Cibis2020Characterization). These zinc finger domains contribute to the protein's ability to form complexes with other proteins, indicating a potential quaternary structure (Cibis2020Characterization). ZMYM2 is also involved in transcriptional repression as part of the CoREST transcriptional corepressor complex (AguilarMartinez2015Screen).

The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including SUMOylation, which is essential for its function in transcriptional regulation and chromatin recruitment (AguilarMartinez2015Screen). SUMOylation occurs at multiple sites and influences ZMYM2's interactions with other proteins, such as HDAC1, through its zinc finger region (AguilarMartinez2015Screen). Additionally, ZMYM2 can be phosphorylated, which may affect its activity and interactions (Lezmi2020The).

ZMYM2 may exist in different isoforms due to splice variants, which could lead to distinct functional roles within the cell (Cibis2020Characterization). These structural features and modifications underscore ZMYM2's involvement in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and the DNA damage response.

## Function
ZMYM2 is a zinc finger transcriptional regulator that functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor in healthy human cells. It is involved in maintaining cell identity and genomic stability by repressing the expression of transposable elements, particularly retrotransposons such as long terminal repeats (LTRs) and short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) (Owen2023ZMYM2). ZMYM2 achieves this through its participation in various chromatin-bound complexes, including the LSD1-CoREST-HDAC1 corepressor complex and the ChAHP complex centered on ADNP (Owen2023ZMYM2).

The protein interacts with TRIM28 in a SUMO-dependent manner, forming a complex that regulates gene expression regionally within topologically associating domains (TADs) (Owen2023ZMYM2). ZMYM2 also plays a role in the transition from totipotency to pluripotency in embryonic stem cells and opposes reprogramming in human fibroblasts (Owen2023ZMYM2). In the context of the cell cycle, ZMYM2 is involved in the G1/S-phase transition, potentially in conjunction with the B-MYB protein, as its knockdown impairs this transition in certain cell types (Cibis2020Characterization). Overall, ZMYM2 is crucial for transcriptional repression, chromatin regulation, and maintaining the balance between pluripotency and differentiation in stem cells (Lezmi2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ZMYM2 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. ZMYM2 is associated with congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) and chronic kidney disease, primarily due to heterozygous loss of function mutations (Owen2023ZMYM2). These mutations are also linked to syndromic urinary tract malformations, highlighting the gene's importance in normal urinary tract development (Connaughton2020Mutations).

In the context of cancer, ZMYM2 is involved in oncogenic fusion events, particularly with FGFR1, leading to myeloproliferative diseases and T-cell lymphomas. The ZMYM2-FGFR1 fusion gene is implicated in aggressive T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and is associated with the activation of the Notch1 pathway, which plays a significant role in the disease's pathogenesis (Ren2011Constitutive).

ZMYM2 has also emerged as a candidate gene for schizophrenia, with studies identifying rare loss-of-function variants in individuals with the disorder. These findings suggest that ZMYM2 may contribute to the genetic predisposition to schizophrenia and other neurodevelopmental disorders (Mojarad2021Genome). The gene's involvement in these conditions underscores its clinical significance and potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
ZMYM2 is involved in various protein interactions and is a component of several multiprotein complexes that regulate transcription. It interacts with TRIM28, forming a co-regulatory complex that can both activate and repress gene expression, although the directionality of these effects is not clearly defined (Owen2023ZMYM2). ZMYM2 also recruits HDAC-containing complexes to repress MERVL and 2C gene expression in embryonic stem cells, interacting with the LSD1-RCOR1/2 corepressor complex, which includes subunits like CHD4, GATAD2B, RBBP4, and HDAC1/2 (Yang2020DUXmiR344ZMYM2Mediated).

ZMYM2's recruitment to chromatin is mediated by its multi-SUMO-binding activity, which is crucial for its function in transcriptional regulation. This interaction is facilitated through a multi-SIM module, allowing ZMYM2 to bind to multi-SUMO platforms (AguilarMartinez2015Screen). ZMYM2 also interacts with B-MYB, a transcription factor involved in cell cycle progression, and this interaction is independent of ZMYM4 (Cibis2020Characterization).

In human pluripotent stem cells, ZMYM2 interacts with pluripotency markers OCT4 and NANOG and associates with the repressive LCH histone-modifying complex, suggesting a role in silencing pluripotency genes (Lezmi2020The).
