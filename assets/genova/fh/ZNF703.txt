# ZNF703

## Overview
ZNF703 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 703, a transcription factor involved in the regulation of gene expression. This protein is characterized by the presence of a C2H2 zinc finger domain, which facilitates its interaction with DNA, and several other conserved domains that are crucial for its function as a transcriptional repressor (Pereira‐Castro2012Characterization; Nakamura2008Nlz1Znf703). ZNF703 is part of the NET/NlZ family and plays a significant role in cell proliferation and differentiation, particularly in the context of cancer progression (Wang2020ZNF703). It is known to interact with various proteins and histone deacetylases, contributing to its role in epigenetic regulation and transcriptional repression (Nakamura2008Nlz1Znf703). Overexpression of ZNF703 has been implicated in several cancers, including breast, ovarian, and gastric cancers, where it is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to certain therapies (Wang2020ZNF703; Zhang2022ZNF703).

## Structure
ZNF703 is a transcription factor characterized by several conserved domains essential for its function. The protein includes a C2H2 zinc finger domain, which is a common motif in DNA-binding proteins, facilitating interactions with DNA and other proteins (Pereira‐Castro2012Characterization; Nakamura2008Nlz1Znf703). ZNF703 also contains a spacer (Sp) domain, a round head box (BTD) domain, and three unique domains specific to the NET protein family: LP, PY, and YL (Wang2020ZNF703; Pereira‐Castro2012Characterization). These domains are crucial for the protein's subcellular localization and transcriptional repression activities (Pereira‐Castro2012Characterization).

The PY and YL domains are particularly important for nuclear localization, as their deletion results in altered nuclear distribution (Pereira‐Castro2012Characterization). Despite lacking a classical nuclear localization signal, ZNF703 relies on these domains for nuclear import (Pereira‐Castro2012Characterization). The protein's interaction with histone deacetylases suggests a role in epigenetic regulation, contributing to its function as a transcriptional repressor (Nakamura2008Nlz1Znf703).

ZNF703 undergoes alternative polyadenylation, resulting in multiple mRNA isoforms with different 3'-UTR lengths, which may influence its expression and function (Pereira‐Castro2012Characterization). These structural features and modifications underscore ZNF703's role in transcriptional regulation and its involvement in cancer progression (Wang2020ZNF703).

## Function
ZNF703 is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in regulating gene expression in human cells. It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA and influences the transcription of target genes. ZNF703 is part of the NET/NlZ family and contains several conserved domains, including the C2H2 zinc finger domain, which is crucial for its DNA-binding capability (Wang2020ZNF703).

In healthy cells, ZNF703 is involved in cell proliferation and differentiation processes. It functions as a transcriptional repressor and is expressed in almost all human adult tissues (Yang2018ZNF703). ZNF703 is part of a nuclear repressor complex, interacting with proteins such as DCAF7, HSP60, and PHB2, which suggests its role in transcriptional repression, particularly in the context of estrogen receptor (ER) activity (Sircoulomb2011ZNF703).

ZNF703's activity is linked to the regulation of the cell cycle, particularly the G1 phase, where it may alter the balance between self-renewal and differentiation (Sircoulomb2011ZNF703). It is also associated with the modulation of master transcriptional regulators such as ER and E2F1, impacting cell cycle progression and potentially affecting stem cell biology (Sircoulomb2011ZNF703).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF703 is implicated in the progression of several cancers, including ovarian, colorectal, gastric, and breast cancers. In ovarian cancer, ZNF703 is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis. It promotes tumor progression by interacting with HE4 and epigenetically regulating PEA15, affecting cell proliferation, migration, and adhesion (Wang2020ZNF703). In colorectal cancer, ZNF703 is upregulated in tumor tissues and correlates with T cell dysfunction phenotypes. High expression is linked to better overall survival, while low expression may increase sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade therapy, suggesting its potential as a target for immunotherapy (Wang2023Characterization).

In gastric cancer, ZNF703 is overexpressed in adenocarcinoma tissues and correlates with tumor progression factors such as invasion and metastasis. Silencing ZNF703 reduces cell proliferation and migration, indicating its role as an oncogene (YANG2014ZNF703). In breast cancer, particularly triple-negative and luminal types, ZNF703 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to treatments like tamoxifen. It influences cell cycle signaling and may serve as a biomarker for treatment outcomes (Zhang2022ZNF703; Zhang2013Luminal).

## Interactions
ZNF703 is known to interact with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation and cancer progression. In ovarian cancer, ZNF703 interacts with the glycoprotein HE4, which facilitates its nuclear translocation. This interaction has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence co-localization studies in ovarian cancer cell lines such as CAOV3 and OVCAR3 (Wang2020ZNF703). ZNF703 also binds to the enhancer region of PEA15, promoting its transcription and enhancing cancer cell proliferation (Wang2020ZNF703).

ZNF703 is involved in the formation of nuclear transcription complexes and can recruit histone deacetylation complexes, affecting cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Wang2020ZNF703). It interacts with histone deacetylases (HDAC1 and HDAC2), which is crucial for its transcriptional repressive function (Nakamura2008Nlz1Znf703). The interaction with HDACs is mediated by a domain located between the 'buttonhead box' and the C2H2 zinc finger domain of ZNF703 (Nakamura2008Nlz1Znf703).

In addition, ZNF703 interacts with Groucho family co-repressors, which are involved in transcriptional repression. This interaction is essential for its repressive activity, although the specific domains required for this interaction are not necessary for binding to Groucho co-repressors (Pereira‐Castro2012Characterization).
