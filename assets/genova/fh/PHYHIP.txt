# PHYHIP

## Overview
PHYHIP is a gene that encodes the phytanoyl-CoA 2-hydroxylase interacting protein, which is primarily involved in lipid metabolism. This protein is crucial for the breakdown of phytanic acid through its interaction with phytanoyl-CoA 2-hydroxylase, an enzyme essential for the alpha-oxidation of fatty acids. The protein is localized in peroxisomes, where it contributes to maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis and energy production. Beyond its metabolic roles, PHYHIP is highly expressed in the brain and is implicated in the development and function of the central nervous system (CNS). It is associated with neurological conditions, including those observed in Down syndrome, and plays a role in neuronal differentiation and inhibition of angiogenesis. The expression of PHYHIP is also altered in certain pathological conditions, such as adrenocortical tumors with CTNNB1 mutations (Saeed2019Cytotoxicity; Durand2011Characterization; Gubern2013miRNA; Skvortsova2016Intragenic).

## Structure


## Function
PHYHIP (phytanoyl-CoA 2-hydroxylase interacting protein) is involved in lipid metabolism, particularly in the breakdown of phytanic acid. It interacts with phytanoyl-CoA 2-hydroxylase, an enzyme crucial for the alpha-oxidation of fatty acids, and is active in the peroxisomes, contributing to cellular lipid homeostasis and energy production. This protein plays a significant role in the central nervous system (CNS) development, suggesting its involvement in processes related to the development and function of the CNS (Saeed2019Cytotoxicity).

In addition to its metabolic functions, PHYHIP is highly expressed in brain tissues and is suggested to play a role in the development of neurological abnormalities observed in Down syndrome patients (Skvortsova2016Intragenic). It is also implicated in neuronal functions such as inhibition of angiogenesis and neuronal differentiation, as indicated by its regulation by miR-347, which is associated with neuronal apoptosis following cerebral ischemia (Gubern2013miRNA). The expression of PHYHIP is significantly altered in certain pathological conditions, such as being underexpressed in adrenocortical tumors with CTNNB1 mutations (Durand2011Characterization).
