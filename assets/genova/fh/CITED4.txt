# CITED4

## Overview
CITED4, or Cbp/p300 interacting transactivator with Glu/Asp rich carboxy-terminal domain 4, is a gene that encodes a transcriptional co-activator protein involved in various cellular processes. The CITED4 protein is primarily known for its role as a transcriptional co-activator, interacting with the CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300, which are key transcriptional co-activators and histone acetyltransferases. This interaction is crucial for modulating gene expression, as CITED4 does not directly bind to DNA but facilitates the activity of transcription factors such as SMAD4 and the estrogen receptor. CITED4 is expressed in multiple human tissues, with notable expression in the heart, liver, skeletal muscle, and pancreas, indicating its involvement in diverse physiological functions (Bragança2002Human). The protein's interactions and regulatory roles are significant in contexts such as cardiac remodeling and cancer, where alterations in CITED4 expression can impact disease progression and patient outcomes (Rogers2015CITED4; Lerchenmüller2020CITED4).

## Function
CITED4 is a transcriptional coactivator that plays a significant role in cellular processes by interacting with the CBP/p300 complex. It functions primarily as a co-activator for transcription factor AP-2 (TFAP2) isoforms, enhancing their transcriptional activity in a cell type and isoform-specific manner. In Hep3B cells, CITED4 is a strong co-activator for TFAP2A and TFAP2B, while in HepG2 cells, it is less effective for TFAP2C compared to CITED2 (Bragança2002Human). CITED4 does not bind DNA directly but acts as a transcriptional co-activator, linking transcription factors such as SMAD4 and the estrogen receptor to p300/CBP, thereby modulating gene expression (Bragança2002Human).

CITED4 is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it forms complexes with p300/CBP, binding specifically to the CH1 domain of p300. This interaction is crucial for its transactivation function, as demonstrated by the loss of transactivation ability upon deletion of key residues necessary for p300 binding (Bragança2002Human). CITED4 is expressed in various human tissues, with the highest levels in the heart, liver, skeletal muscle, and pancreas, indicating its involvement in diverse physiological processes (Bragança2002Human).

## Clinical Significance
CITED4 has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In oligodendroglial tumors, CITED4 is frequently hypermethylated, particularly in tumors with allelic losses on chromosomes 1p and 19q. This hypermethylation is associated with reduced CITED4 transcript levels and correlates with longer recurrence-free and overall survival in patients, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Tews2007Hypermethylation). 

In colorectal cancer, CITED4 expression levels influence cell proliferation. High CITED4 expression is linked to poorer relapse-free survival, while silencing CITED4 reduces cell proliferation and alters gene expression related to cell junctions (Rogers2015CITED4).

CITED4 also plays a significant role in cardiac remodeling. In cardiomyocytes, CITED4 is crucial for adaptive responses to stress, such as exercise. Its deletion leads to maladaptive cardiac remodeling, characterized by increased fibrosis and impaired cardiac function. CITED4 regulates mitochondrial pathways and miRNA networks, which are essential for maintaining cardiac function and preventing heart failure (Lerchenmüller2020CITED4).

## Interactions
CITED4 is a transcriptional co-activator that interacts with several proteins but does not directly bind to nucleic acids. It binds with high affinity to the CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300, which are transcriptional co-activators and histone acetyltransferases. These interactions occur between the cysteine-histidine-rich domain 1 of p300 and the carboxyl terminus of CITED4 (Bragança2002Human). CITED4 also interacts with all isoforms of the transcription factor AP-2 (TFAP2) and acts as a co-activator for these isoforms in certain cell types, such as Hep3B cells (Bragança2002Human).

In cardiomyocytes, CITED4 interacts with CBP/p300, which is significant for regulating miR30d expression and potentially influencing mitochondrial function and apoptosis (Lerchenmüller2020CITED4). CITED4 also interacts with hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α), negatively regulating its binding to CBP/p300 and thus inhibiting hypoxia-activated transcription (Rogers2015CITED4). These interactions highlight CITED4's role in modulating transcriptional activity and cellular responses to various physiological conditions.
