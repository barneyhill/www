# CFHR5

## Overview
The CFHR5 gene encodes the protein complement factor H-related 5 (FHR-5), which is a member of the complement factor H protein family. FHR-5 is primarily involved in the regulation of the complement system, an essential component of the innate immune response. This protein is characterized by its structure, which includes nine short consensus repeat (SCR) domains, allowing it to interact with various components of the complement cascade, such as C3b and C3d. FHR-5 modulates complement activation by binding to these components and inhibiting the activity of C3 convertase, albeit with less potency than the closely related Factor H (Skerka2013Complement; McRae2005Human). The protein also interacts with other molecules, including heparin, C-reactive protein, and lipoprotein particles, suggesting additional roles in lipid metabolism and inflammatory response regulation (McRae2005Human). Mutations in the CFHR5 gene are linked to CFHR5 nephropathy, a form of C3 glomerulonephritis, highlighting its clinical significance in renal pathologies (Deltas2012C3; Gale2010Identification).

## Structure
The CFHR5 protein, also known as complement factor H-related 5, is composed of nine short consensus repeat (SCR) domains, each approximately 61 amino acids in length. These domains are characterized by a consensus sequence with four invariant cysteine residues forming two disulfide bridges and a conserved tryptophan residue, folding into a β-sandwich arrangement of six hydrogen-bonded β-strands (Skerka2013Complement; KadkhodayiKholghi2020The). 

CFHR5 forms native homodimers through its N-terminal domains (SCR-1/2), which are crucial for its function in binding to complement components like C3b and C3d (Skerka2013Complement; KadkhodayiKholghi2020The). The dimeric structure is compact, with a radius of gyration of 5.5 ± 0.2 nm and a maximum length of 20 nm (KadkhodayiKholghi2020The). The protein's quaternary structure is further characterized by its ability to form oligomers, particularly in the presence of mutant forms with duplicated SCR-1/2 domains, which enhance its binding avidity (KadkhodayiKholghi2020The).

CFHR5 is glycosylated, with a molecular weight of approximately 62 kDa, and is associated with lipoprotein particles (Skerka2013Complement). The protein's structure is complicated by its large size and flexible interdomain linkers, which pose challenges for crystallization (KadkhodayiKholghi2020The).

## Function
The CFHR5 gene encodes Factor H-related protein 5 (FHR-5), which plays a significant role in the regulation of the complement system, a crucial component of the immune response. FHR-5 is involved in modulating complement activation by binding to C3b, a key protein in the complement cascade, and inhibiting the activity of C3 convertase, although its potency is lower than that of Factor H (Skerka2013Complement; McRae2005Human). FHR-5 also exhibits cofactor activity for the factor I-mediated cleavage of C3b into iC3b, contributing to the regulation of complement activation (McRae2005Human).

FHR-5 is primarily active in the plasma and is known to bind to heparin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and lipoprotein particles, particularly high-density lipoprotein (HDL), suggesting a role in lipid metabolism or transport (McRae2005Human). It is also involved in interactions with pentraxins and the extracellular matrix, which may help position it at cell surfaces to regulate complement activation (Garam2021FHR5). The protein's ability to bind CRP suggests it may help prevent complement-mediated damage to self-tissues by limiting inflammatory responses (McRae2005Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CFHR5 gene are primarily associated with CFHR5 nephropathy, a form of C3 glomerulonephritis (C3GN). This condition is characterized by isolated microscopic hematuria, with or without intermittent macroscopic hematuria, and progressive renal impairment, particularly in males. CFHR5 nephropathy follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and is linked to a specific mutation involving the duplication of exons 2-3 of the CFHR5 gene. This mutation has been predominantly identified in individuals of Greek-Cypriot descent, indicating a strong founder effect in this population (Deltas2012C3; Gale2010Identification).

The disease is marked by the deposition of C3 complement in the glomerulus without immune complexes, suggesting dysregulation of the alternative complement pathway (Deltas2012C3). Approximately 50% of patients over 50 years of age progress to chronic kidney disease, and 14% progress to end-stage kidney disease (Deltas2012C3). The CFHR5 mutation results in a novel protein with duplicated domains, which disrupts the regulation of the complement system, leading to the pathological features observed in CFHR5 nephropathy (Gale2010Identification).

Additionally, variations in CFHR5 have been associated with other complement-mediated diseases, such as membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type II (MPGN II), also known as dense deposit disease (AbreraAbeleda2005Variations).

## Interactions
CFHR5 interacts with several proteins, particularly within the complement system. It binds to complement fragment C3b, facilitating the formation of the C3bBb alternative pathway C3 convertase, although this is less efficient compared to CFHR4A (Csincsi2015Factor). CFHR5 also binds to pentraxin 3 (PTX3) and the extracellular matrix (ECM), competing with Factor H (FH) for these interactions. This competition inhibits FH's binding and cofactor activity, thereby modulating complement activation (Csincsi2015Factor).

CFHR5 can partially inhibit the binding of C1q to PTX3, which is significant for classical complement pathway activation (Csincsi2015Factor). It also interacts with denatured, monomeric C-reactive protein (CRP), inhibiting FH binding and cofactor activity in this context (Csincsi2015Factor). CFHR5 binds to ECM proteins such as laminin, fibromodulin, osteoadherin, and PRELP, reducing FH's regulatory activity and enhancing complement activation (Papp2022Complement).

The protein also associates with lipoprotein complexes, specifically in whole plasma and HDL-purified preparations, but not in LDL or VLDL preparations (McRae2005Human). These interactions highlight CFHR5's role in modulating complement activation and its potential involvement in inflammatory responses and renal pathologies.
