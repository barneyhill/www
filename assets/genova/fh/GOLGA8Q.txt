# GOLGA8Q

## Overview
GOLGA8Q is a gene that encodes the protein golgin A8 family member Q, which is part of the golgin family of proteins. Golgins are a group of coiled-coil proteins primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus, a critical organelle involved in the modification, sorting, and packaging of proteins and lipids within the cell. The golgin A8 family member Q is implicated in maintaining the structural integrity of the Golgi apparatus and facilitating vesicular transport processes. Although the specific functions of GOLGA8Q and its encoded protein are not fully elucidated, they are believed to play a role in cellular trafficking and Golgi organization, similar to other members of the golgin family (Qiu2020aarFDC).
