# SLC7A13

## Overview
SLC7A13 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 7 member 13, which is a transmembrane transporter involved in the sodium-independent transport of anionic amino acids. This protein functions as an antiporter, facilitating the exchange of amino acids such as L-aspartate, L-glutamate, and L-cystine across cell membranes, primarily in the proximal tubules of the kidney. The activity of SLC7A13 is essential for various physiological processes, including energy metabolism, acid-base balance, and nitrogen excretion, as well as contributing to neurotransmission and protection against oxidative stress (Kandasamy2018Amino). Despite its critical role in these processes, the clinical significance of SLC7A13 remains under investigation, with studies exploring its potential involvement in conditions such as cystinuria and chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (Olschok2018No; Nanayakkara2015Wholeexome).

## Function
SLC7A13 is a member of the solute carrier family involved in the transport of amino acids across cell membranes. It functions as an antiporter, specifically transporting anionic amino acids such as L-aspartate (L-Asp), L-glutamate (L-Glu), and L-cystine. This transporter is primarily located in the proximal tubules of the kidney, where it plays a significant role in energy metabolism, acid-base regulation, and nitrogen excretion (Kandasamy2018Amino).

The activity of SLC7A13 is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and facilitating the exchange of amino acids, which are essential for various metabolic processes. By mediating the transport of these amino acids, SLC7A13 contributes to the regulation of neurotransmission and protection against oxidative stress, as well as supporting nitrogen metabolism (Kandasamy2018Amino). Although specific details about its molecular function in healthy human cells are not extensively documented, its role in these fundamental processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal health. The protein is active in the plasma membrane, where it facilitates the exchange of amino acids, ensuring the proper functioning of metabolic pathways and cellular activities (Kandasamy2018Amino).

## Clinical Significance
The SLC7A13 gene, encoding a sodium-independent aspartate/glutamate transporter, has been investigated for its potential role in various diseases, though its clinical significance remains unclear. In the context of cystinuria, a genetic disorder characterized by the formation of cystine stones in the kidneys, SLC7A13 was considered a candidate gene due to its function as a cystine transporter in the renal proximal tubule. However, studies have not found pathogenic mutations in SLC7A13 that contribute significantly to cystinuria, suggesting that other genetic factors may be responsible for the condition in patients without mutations in the known cystinuria-associated genes SLC3A1 and SLC7A9 (Olschok2018No).

In chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu), a specific SNP in SLC7A13 was identified, but its clinical significance remains undetermined, as the study primarily focused on other genes (Nanayakkara2015Wholeexome). While SLC7A13 is involved in amino acid transport, its direct association with specific diseases or conditions due to mutations or altered expression levels has not been conclusively established in the current literature (Kandasamy2018Amino). Further research is needed to clarify its role in disease pathogenesis.
