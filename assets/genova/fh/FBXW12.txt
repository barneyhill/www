# FBXW12

## Overview
FBXW12 is a gene that encodes the protein F-box and WD repeat domain containing 12, which is part of the F-box protein family. These proteins are characterized by an F-box motif and are involved in forming the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) complex, a type of E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that plays a crucial role in targeting proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. The FBXW12 protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and signal transduction, through its interactions with other proteins. Its expression and function have been associated with several diseases, particularly in the context of cancer, where it acts as either a protective or high-risk prognostic marker depending on the cancer type (Huang2022Pancancer). Additionally, FBXW12 is involved in the progression of diabetic nephropathy and Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its significance in both oncological and non-oncological pathologies (Miller2010Divergence; Sun2021CircFBXW12).

## Clinical Significance
FBXW12 has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in cancer prognosis and progression. In the context of cancer, FBXW12 is identified as a protective prognostic gene in acute myeloid leukemia (LAML), rectum adenocarcinoma (READ), and uveal melanoma (UVM), but as a high-risk gene in thymoma (THYM), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBC), kidney chromophobe (KICH), and prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) (Huang2022Pancancer). The gene's expression levels vary across different cancer types, being more expressed in cancers such as bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA), breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA), and liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), while lower in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) (Huang2022Pancancer).

FBXW12 is also involved in the progression of diabetic nephropathy (DN) through its circular RNA form, circ-FBXW12. This circular RNA is highly expressed in DN patients and contributes to disease progression by interacting with miR-31-5p and inducing LIN28B expression, which affects cell proliferation, inflammation, and oxidative stress (Sun2021CircFBXW12). Additionally, FBXW12 has been linked to Alzheimer's disease progression, as it is part of a gene module correlated with the disease (Miller2010Divergence).
