# BSPRY

## Overview
BSPRY (B-box and SPRY domain containing) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of calcium transport in epithelial cells. The protein, also referred to as BSPRY, is characterized by the presence of a B-box motif and a SPRY domain, both of which are implicated in protein-protein interactions. These structural features suggest that BSPRY may play a role in cytoskeleton-related processes and inhibitory signaling cascades. Functionally, BSPRY is known to interact with epithelial calcium channels, specifically TRPV5 and TRPV6, modulating their activity and thus influencing calcium homeostasis. The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the kidney, where it co-localizes with TRPV5, indicating its physiological role in calcium transport regulation. BSPRY's expression is inversely regulated by vitamin D3, further highlighting its potential involvement in calcium homeostasis (van2006Identification).

## Structure
The BSPRY protein is characterized by the presence of a B-box and a SPRY domain. The B-box motif forms a zinc finger structure, which is typically involved in protein-protein interactions (Schenker2000BSPRY). The SPRY domain, located at the C-terminus, is also implicated in protein-protein interactions and is highly conserved across species (Birkenfeld2003Characterization; Schenker2000BSPRY). The human BSPRY protein consists of 402 amino acids with a molecular weight of 44.4 kDa and an isoelectric point of 6.4 (Schenker2000BSPRY).

The secondary structure of BSPRY includes a K-helical coiled coil, which is likely involved in protein-protein interactions (Schenker2000BSPRY). The protein lacks a RING finger motif, which is present in other related proteins and is involved in ubiquitination events, raising questions about its role in protein targeting for destruction (Schenker2000BSPRY).

BSPRY may exist in multiple splice variant isoforms, as seen in its mouse homolog, which has two isoforms with differing C-terminal ends due to alternative splicing (IKEDA2012Bbox). These isoforms are associated with different functional roles in embryonic development and stem cell pluripotency (IKEDA2012Bbox).

## Function
BSPRY (B-box and SPRY domain containing) is a protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of calcium transport in epithelial cells. It interacts specifically with the epithelial calcium channel TRPV5, which is crucial for calcium absorption in epithelial tissues. BSPRY negatively modulates TRPV5 activity, reducing calcium influx in cells expressing TRPV5 without affecting the channel's presence on the cell surface. This suggests that BSPRY is involved in signaling pathways that regulate calcium channel activity at the cell surface (van2006Identification).

BSPRY is expressed in various tissues, including the kidney, where it co-localizes with TRPV5 in the distal convoluted tubule and connecting tubule. This co-localization indicates a physiological role for BSPRY in regulating epithelial calcium transport by associating with TRPV5 (van2006Identification). The protein contains B-box and SPRY domains, which are implicated in protein-protein interactions, suggesting its involvement in cytoskeleton-related processes and inhibitory signaling cascades that control the activity of epithelial calcium channels (van2006Identification).

BSPRY's expression is inversely regulated by the calciotropic hormone vitamin D3, indicating a potential role in calcium homeostasis (van2006Identification).

## Interactions
BSPRY (B-box and SPRY domain containing) is known to interact with the epithelial calcium channels TRPV5 and TRPV6. These interactions were confirmed through various experimental methods, including yeast two-hybrid screening, GST pull-down assays, and co-immunoprecipitation. BSPRY co-localizes with TRPV5 in the calcium-transporting segments of the kidney, specifically in the distal convoluted tubule and connecting tubule, indicating a specific physiological role in regulating epithelial calcium transport (Mensenkamp2024TRPV5; van2006Identification).

BSPRY inhibits TRPV5-mediated calcium influx in MDCK cells by approximately 41%, suggesting an inhibitory role in calcium transport regulation. This inhibition does not involve changes in TRPV5 trafficking to the cell surface, as cell-surface biotinylation studies did not support this hypothesis. Instead, BSPRY may participate in signaling cascades that regulate the activity of calcium channels at the cell surface (van2006Identification).

BSPRY also interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, which are known to bind phosphorylated proteins and are involved in various signaling pathways. However, the exact mechanism of BSPRY's inhibitory effect on TRPV5 remains to be fully elucidated (van2006Identification).
