# C6orf132

## Overview
C6orf132, also known as FAM217A, is a gene located on chromosome 6 that encodes the protein chromosome 6 open reading frame 132. This protein is currently uncharacterized, but it is implicated in various cellular processes, particularly those related to cancer. The protein is involved in protein-protein interactions with key molecules such as CDH1 and EZR, which are significant in cell adhesion and cytoskeletal dynamics, respectively (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). These interactions suggest a role in cancer-related signaling pathways, as C6orf132 is associated with a high representation of oncoproteins in its subinteractome (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). The gene's expression levels have been linked to cancer prognosis, with alterations observed in testicular germ cell tumors and rectum adenocarcinoma, among others (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Additionally, the circular RNA form of C6orf132, circC6orf132, is involved in cancer cell proliferation and metabolism under hypoxic conditions, further underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target (Chen2021CircC6orf132).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
C6orf132, also known as FAM217A, has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT), C6orf132 is up-regulated, suggesting a role in tumor progression (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). In rectum adenocarcinoma (READ), higher expression levels of C6orf132 are associated with better overall survival rates, with a hazard ratio of 0.37, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). This gene is also part of a transcriptomic signature in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), where its expression correlates with survival outcomes (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

In gastric cancer (GC), the circular RNA form of C6orf132, circC6orf132, is upregulated under hypoxic conditions, promoting proliferation, migration, invasion, and glycolysis in cancer cells. This suggests its involvement in cancer progression through the miR-873-5p/PRKAA1 axis, making it a potential therapeutic target (Chen2021CircC6orf132). The interactions of C6orf132 with proteins like CDH1 and EZR may also play roles in cancer biology, potentially affecting cell adhesion and cytoskeletal connections (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). These findings highlight the clinical significance of C6orf132 in cancer prognosis and therapy.

## Interactions
C6orf132, also known as FAM217A, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that may play roles in cancer-related processes. It interacts with CDH1 and EZR, with the interaction with CDH1 noted in colon transverse tissue and the interaction with EZR in colon tissue. CDH1 is involved in calcium-dependent cell adhesion, while EZR acts as a tumor suppressor and adapter protein between the actin cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane, influencing cancer promotion through signaling pathways. These interactions are considered potential binary protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and are part of a subgroup of cancer-dependent PPIs, where gene co-expression patterns are highly dependent on the cancer context (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

C6orf132 is also associated with a high representation of oncoproteins in its subinteractome, including interactions with CDH1, ESR1, and EZR, suggesting its involvement in cancer-related signaling pathways (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). However, specific details on the physical interactions of C6orf132 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not provided in the available literature. The protein's interactions are predicted based on changes in correlation coefficients in cancerous versus normal tissues (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).
