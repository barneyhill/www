# CLPTM1L

## Overview
The CLPTM1L gene encodes the CLPTM1-like protein, a transmembrane protein primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and involved in lipid translocation processes. This protein functions as a lipid scramblase, playing a critical role in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs), which are essential for anchoring proteins to the cell membrane and facilitating various cellular processes (Wang2021CLPTM1L). The CLPTM1-like protein's activity is crucial for the translocation of glucosaminyl-phosphatidylinositol (GlcN-PI) across the ER membrane, a key step in the GPI biosynthetic pathway (Wang2021CLPTM1L). Beyond its fundamental cellular functions, CLPTM1L is implicated in several cancers, where it contributes to tumorigenesis and resistance to therapies, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Awazu2023CLPTM1L; James2014CRR9CLPTM1L).

## Function
The CLPTM1L gene encodes a protein that functions as a lipid scramblase, playing a crucial role in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs) in healthy human cells. GPIs are essential glycolipids that anchor proteins to the cell membrane, influencing various cellular processes such as signaling and interaction (Wang2021CLPTM1L). The biosynthesis of GPIs begins at the cytosolic face of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where the intermediate glucosaminyl-phosphatidylinositol (GlcN-PI) is translocated across the membrane to the lumenal face for further processing. CLPTM1L is involved in this translocation, facilitating the movement of GlcN-PI across the ER membrane, a critical step in the GPI biosynthetic pathway (Wang2021CLPTM1L).

CLPTM1L's scramblase activity is dose-dependent and contributes significantly to the translocation of GlcN-PI and other phospholipids, maintaining steady-state levels of GPI-anchored proteins on the cell surface (Wang2021CLPTM1L). The protein is localized primarily in the ER, where it colocalizes with other ER membrane proteins, supporting its role in lipid translocation processes (Wang2021CLPTM1L). This function is vital for the proper formation of GPI intermediates and the efficient generation of GPI-anchored proteins, impacting cellular functions and organismal outcomes (Wang2021CLPTM1L).

## Clinical Significance
The CLPTM1L gene is implicated in various cancers, including lung, cervical, pancreatic, bladder, glioma, prostate, basal cell carcinoma, and melanoma. Its overexpression is notably associated with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where it contributes to resistance against genotoxic apoptosis and is essential for Ras-driven tumorigenesis (James2014CRR9CLPTM1L). In lung adenocarcinoma, CLPTM1L is overexpressed in 83% of patients, with some showing up to an 8.7-fold increase compared to normal tissues (James2014CRR9CLPTM1L). Genetic polymorphisms within the CLPTM1L locus, such as rs31489, are linked to increased lung cancer risk (James2014CRR9CLPTM1L).

In cervical cancer, high CLPTM1L expression is associated with recurrence and poor prognosis, serving as a potential prognostic marker (Awazu2023CLPTM1L). The gene's role in apoptosis resistance is mediated through the PI3K/AKT pathway, which upregulates the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL, contributing to chemoresistance (Awazu2023CLPTM1L). In NSCLC, CLPTM1L expression correlates with radioresistance, and its knockdown increases sensitivity to radiation therapy (Li2020CLPTM1L). These findings highlight CLPTM1L's significance in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
The CLPTM1L protein is involved in several significant interactions with other proteins, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, CLPTM1L directly interacts with the estrogen receptor β (ERβ) through its LXXLL motif, which is essential for binding to nuclear receptors. This interaction facilitates the nuclear localization of CLPTM1L and coactivates ERβ, enhancing the expression of ERβ target genes involved in radioresistance (Li2020CLPTM1L).

In pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells, CLPTM1L interacts with Glucose Regulated Protein 78 (GRP78) at the cell surface. This interaction is crucial for survival signaling and chemoresistance under endoplasmic reticulum stress conditions. The extracellular domain of CLPTM1L is necessary for this interaction, which is enhanced by treatments such as gemcitabine (Clarke2019CLPTM1LCRR9).

CLPTM1L also interacts with catalytic subunits of PI3K, specifically PIK3C3 and PIK3Calpha, in NIH3T3 cell lysates. This interaction is important for Ras-induced AKT activation and Bcl-xL accumulation, contributing to cell survival signaling and oncogenic transformation (James2014CRR9CLPTM1L).
