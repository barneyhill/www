# ADM5

## Overview
The ADM5 gene encodes the protein adrenomedullin 5 (putative), which is a member of the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) family. This protein is categorized as a peptide hormone and is thought to play a role in various physiological processes, although its specific functions remain largely speculative. Adrenomedullin 5 is believed to be involved in vasodilation and angiogenesis, similar to other members of the adrenomedullin family, but its precise biological activities and mechanisms of action are not yet fully understood. The gene and its encoded protein are subjects of ongoing research, particularly in the context of their potential implications in cardiovascular and metabolic disorders (Qiu2020aarFDC).
