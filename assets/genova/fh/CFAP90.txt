# CFAP90

## Overview
CFAP90, or cilia and flagella associated protein 90, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the structure and function of cilia in human cells. The CFAP90 protein is categorized as a microtubule-associated protein due to its involvement in the assembly and stability of cilia, which are essential for various cellular processes, including motility and sensory functions. The protein is characterized by a conserved SNYG module, which facilitates its microtubule-binding properties, crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of cilia. CFAP90 is localized at the inner junction of the axoneme, where it interacts with other ciliary proteins to ensure proper cellular and organismal function (Brody2024Loss; Andersen2024Uncovering).

## Function
CFAP90, also known as cilia and flagella associated protein 90, plays a significant role in the structure and function of cilia in healthy human cells. It is involved in the assembly and stability of cilia, which are essential for cell motility, fluid movement across epithelial surfaces, and sensory functions. CFAP90 is active in the axoneme, the core structure of cilia, where it facilitates proper cellular and organismal function (Andersen2024Uncovering).

The protein contains a conserved SNYG module, which is associated with microtubule-binding properties. This module is characterized by a short α-helix, suggesting its role in binding tubulin heterodimers, which are crucial for the structural integrity of cilia (Andersen2024Uncovering). CFAP90 is localized at the inner junction near the hook of the CCDC39/40 heterodimer, indicating its involvement in maintaining the structural integrity of cilia, particularly at the inner junction (Brody2024Loss).

Gene co-expression analysis has shown that CFAP90 is co-regulated with ciliary genes, supporting its role in ciliary function. It is enriched along the length of motile cilia in human bronchial epithelial cells, further underscoring its importance in ciliary biology (Andersen2024Uncovering).
