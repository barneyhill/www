# DAO

## Overview
The DAO gene encodes the enzyme D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO), a flavoenzyme that plays a critical role in the oxidative deamination of D-amino acids. This enzyme is primarily located in the peroxisomes of kidney and liver cells, where it detoxifies D-amino acids from various sources. DAAO is also significant in the central nervous system, where it regulates the levels of D-serine, a co-agonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR), thereby influencing synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission. The enzyme's activity is modulated by interactions with other proteins, such as pLG72, and is implicated in several neurological disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and schizophrenia, due to its role in D-serine metabolism and NMDA receptor function (Kawazoe2007Human; Pollegioni2018Human; Sacchi2018Biochemical).

## Structure
The human D-amino acid oxidase (DAO) enzyme is a flavoenzyme that catalyzes the oxidative deamination of D-amino acids. Its primary structure consists of 347 amino acids, forming a polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of approximately 40.3 kDa per monomer (Pollegioni2018Human; Sacchi2012Structure–function). The secondary structure includes 11 α-helices and 14 β-strands, which fold into two main domains: a substrate-binding domain and a FAD-binding domain (Sacchi2018Biochemical). The FAD-binding domain features the Rossmann fold, a classical dinucleotide binding motif (Sacchi2012Structure–function).

The tertiary structure of DAO is characterized by a stable three-dimensional conformation, with the FAD cofactor buried in the protein core. The isoalloxazine ring of FAD is accessible to the solvent, facilitating its catalytic role (Sacchi2012Structure–function). DAO forms a homodimer in its quaternary structure, with monomers interacting in a head-to-head geometry. This dimeric form is stabilized by a unique charge distribution at the dimer interface (Pollegioni2018Human; Sacchi2018Biochemical).

DAO exhibits a weak interaction with the FAD cofactor, existing in equilibrium between holo- and apoprotein forms. Ligand binding in the active site can stabilize the flavin interaction, enhancing the enzyme's activity (Pollegioni2018Human). The enzyme's activity is modulated by interactions with other proteins and potential post-translational modifications, although specific modifications are not detailed in the context provided.

## Function
The DAO gene encodes the enzyme D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO), which is involved in the oxidative deamination of D-amino acids, converting them into imino acids, ammonia, and hydrogen peroxide. This enzyme is primarily active in the peroxisomes of kidney and liver cells, where it plays a crucial role in detoxifying D-amino acids that originate from dietary sources, intestinal bacteria, or endogenous racemization (Pollegioni2018Human; Sacchi2018Biochemical).

In the central nervous system, DAAO is responsible for the catabolism of D-serine, a co-agonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR), which are essential for synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission. By regulating D-serine levels, DAAO influences NMDAR activation, which is critical for learning and memory functions (Kawazoe2007Human; Sacchi2018Biochemical). DAAO activity is predominantly found in astrocytes within the white matter, where it helps maintain healthy axons by preventing excitotoxicity caused by glutamate overload (Sasabe2014Activity).

DAAO also contributes to hydrogen sulfide generation in the kidney and brain, which is important for regulating kidney function and blood pressure (Pollegioni2018Human). In the immune system, DAAO is expressed in granulocytes, where it aids in microbial defense by producing hydrogen peroxide, which is used to generate microbicidal compounds (Sacchi2018Biochemical).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DAO gene, which encodes the enzyme D-amino acid oxidase, have been implicated in several neurological disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and schizophrenia. In ALS, the R199W mutation in the DAO gene is associated with familial cases of the disease. This mutation impairs enzyme activity, leading to increased levels of D-serine, a co-agonist at the NMDA receptor, which contributes to excitotoxicity and motor neuron degeneration. The mutation also promotes the formation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates and increases autophagy and apoptosis in motor neurons, which are key features of ALS pathology (Paul2014Pathogenic; Kondori2018Focus).

In schizophrenia, the DAO gene is involved in the regulation of D-serine levels, which modulate NMDA receptor activity. Variants in the DAO gene, such as specific SNPs and haplotypes, have been associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia, particularly in certain populations. These genetic variations may lead to altered D-serine metabolism, contributing to NMDA receptor hypofunction, a proposed mechanism in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia (Wood2007Significant; Yang2013The). The DAO gene's interactions with other genes, such as DISC1, further underscore its role in schizophrenia (Yang2013The).

## Interactions
Human D-amino acid oxidase (hDAAO), encoded by the DAO gene, interacts with several proteins that modulate its activity and stability. A significant interaction is with the primate-specific protein pLG72, which forms a complex with hDAAO. This interaction does not alter the kinetic parameters or FAD cofactor binding of hDAAO but changes its tertiary structure, leading to time-dependent inactivation and increased degradation. The binding of pLG72 is suggested to protect against excessive D-serine depletion by reducing hDAAO activity and half-life (Pollegioni2018Human; Sacchi2011Evidence; Sacchi2012Structure–function).

The interaction between hDAAO and pLG72 is complex due to their different subcellular localizations, with hDAAO primarily in peroxisomes and pLG72 in mitochondria. Despite this, they colocalize under certain conditions, particularly on the cytosolic side of mitochondrial membranes, where pLG72 can sequester newly synthesized hDAAO, affecting its activity and stability (Sacchi2011Evidence; Sacchi2012Structure–function).

hDAAO also interacts with the Pex5p receptor, involved in protein import and peroxisome assembly, and with bassoon, a component of the presynaptic active zone, which negatively regulates hDAAO activity to prevent D-serine depletion (Pollegioni2018Human).
