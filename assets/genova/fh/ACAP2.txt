# ACAP2

## Overview
ACAP2 is a gene that encodes the protein ArfGAP with coiled-coil, ankyrin repeat, and PH domains 2, commonly referred to as centaurin β2. This protein functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) specifically for ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6), playing a pivotal role in cellular processes such as membrane trafficking, cytoskeletal organization, and neurite outgrowth. ACAP2 is particularly significant in the context of neural development and phagocytosis, where it acts as a downstream effector of the small GTPase Rab35, facilitating the inactivation of Arf6. This inactivation is crucial for processes like neurite outgrowth and phagosome formation in macrophages (Kobayashi2012Rab35; Egami2011Rab35). Additionally, ACAP2 has been implicated in clinical conditions affecting neural development, such as Chiari Malformation Type II, due to its role in regulating neurite length and differentiation (Guo2018A).

## Function
ACAP2, also known as centaurin β2, is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6), playing a crucial role in various cellular processes, including membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal organization. In healthy human cells, ACAP2 is involved in the regulation of neurite outgrowth, a process essential for neuronal development. It acts as a downstream effector of Rab35, a small GTPase, and is recruited to Arf6-positive endosomes in a Rab35-dependent manner. This recruitment is vital for the inactivation of Arf6, which is necessary for neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (Kobayashi2012Rab35).

ACAP2 also participates in phagosome formation during FcγR-mediated phagocytosis in macrophages. It is recruited to the phagocytic cup membrane by GTP-bound Rab35, where it regulates actin remodeling and membrane trafficking, processes essential for phagosome formation (Egami2011Rab35). Additionally, ACAP2 negatively regulates oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination by switching off Arf6 activity, which is a positive regulator of these processes. Knockdown of ACAP2 promotes differentiation and myelination, indicating its role as a negative regulator in these cellular events (Miyamoto2014Rab35).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ACAP2 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions, particularly those affecting neural development. A study involving a Chinese patient with Chiari Malformation Type II (CM-II) and Sprengel's deformity identified a novel 666 Kb microdeletion in the 3q29 region, which includes the ACAP2 gene. This deletion is thought to lead to haploinsufficiency of ACAP2, contributing to the patient's conditions. The study suggests that down-regulation of ACAP2 can result in reduced neurite length, potentially disrupting primary neurulation and causing neural tube defects such as myelomeningocele (Guo2018A).

ACAP2 is also involved in neurite outgrowth through its interaction with Rab35 and Arf6. It functions as an Arf6-GTPase-activating protein (GAP), and its recruitment to Arf6-positive endosomes is essential for neurite outgrowth. Disruption in this process, such as through knockdown of ACAP2, leads to reduced neurite length, highlighting its critical role in neural development (Kobayashi2012Rab35). These findings underscore the importance of ACAP2 in maintaining normal neural and skeletal development, with alterations potentially leading to significant developmental disorders.

## Interactions
ACAP2, also known as centaurin β2, is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular processes such as neurite outgrowth and phagosome formation. ACAP2 functions as an effector of Rab35, a small GTPase, and is recruited to Arf6-positive endosomes in a Rab35-dependent manner. This interaction is essential for the inactivation of Arf6, which is necessary for neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (Kobayashi2012Rab35). ACAP2 specifically binds to the GTP-bound form of Rab35 through its ankyrin repeat domain, facilitating its recruitment to specific membrane compartments (Egami2011Rab35).

In the context of phagocytosis, ACAP2 is recruited to the membrane of phagocytic cups and newly formed phagosomes in macrophages, a process dependent on GTP-bound Rab35. This recruitment is crucial for actin remodeling and membrane trafficking during FcγR-mediated phagocytosis (Egami2011Rab35). ACAP2 also interacts with Arf6, influencing the actin cytoskeleton and membrane recycling. It is recruited to peripheral, tubular membranes where Arf6 activation occurs, facilitating membrane recycling back to the plasma membrane (Jackson2000Acaps). These interactions highlight ACAP2's role in modulating cellular dynamics through its interactions with Rab35 and Arf6.
