# CCDC83

## Overview
The CCDC83 gene encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 83 protein, which is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil motifs. These motifs are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, suggesting that CCDC83 may play a role in cellular structural organization or signaling pathways. While the specific biological functions of the CCDC83 protein remain to be fully elucidated, its expression has been linked to cancer progression, particularly in breast and prostate cancers. In breast cancer, CCDC83 expression is associated with enhancer methylation status, influencing patient survival outcomes (Wang2017Genomewide). Additionally, CCDC83 has been identified as upregulated in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cell lines, indicating a potential role in drug resistance (Zheng2020Identification). Further research is necessary to understand the comprehensive biological functions and clinical implications of CCDC83.

## Clinical Significance
CCDC83 has been implicated in breast cancer progression, where its expression is influenced by the methylation status of enhancers. Hypomethylated enhancers are associated with higher expression levels of CCDC83, which correlates with poorer patient survival, suggesting its potential role as a breast cancer risk gene (Wang2017Genomewide). The study by Wang et al. identified CCDC83 among 15 breast cancer risk genes regulated by enhancers whose methylation status significantly correlates with patient survival, highlighting its importance in cancer prognosis (Wang2017Genomewide).

In the context of prostate cancer, CCDC83 is mentioned as an upregulated gene in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cell lines, although the specific role or clinical significance of CCDC83 in this resistance is not detailed (Zheng2020Identification). This suggests a potential involvement in drug resistance mechanisms, but further research is needed to clarify its role.

Overall, alterations in the expression of CCDC83, particularly through changes in enhancer methylation, appear to be significant in the context of cancer, affecting both disease progression and patient outcomes. However, the full extent of its clinical significance across different cancer types and other diseases remains to be fully elucidated.
