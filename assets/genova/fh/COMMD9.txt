# COMMD9

## Overview
COMMD9 is a gene that encodes the protein COMM domain containing 9, which is a member of the COMMD protein family. This protein is characterized by its structural domains, including the C-terminal COMM domain and the N-terminal HN domain, which facilitate its role in protein interactions and cellular processes (Healy2018Structural). As a component of the CCC complex, COMMD9 is involved in endosomal trafficking and regulation of sodium balance, particularly through its interaction with the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) (Liu2013Functional). The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the kidney, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining sodium homeostasis and blood pressure (Liu2013Functional). Additionally, COMMD9 has been implicated in cancer biology, with its expression influencing cell proliferation and migration in non-small cell lung cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (Zhan2017COMMD9; Wang2021Transcriptional). These diverse functions underscore the importance of COMMD9 in both physiological and pathological contexts.

## Structure
The COMMD9 protein is characterized by its distinct structural domains, including the C-terminal COMM domain and the N-terminal HN domain. The COMM domain forms a dimeric module composed of two cone-shaped chains that are tightly intertwined, facilitated by a conserved hydrophobic interface along the α-helical surface. This domain is crucial for dimerization and interactions with other proteins, forming a structure analogous to a left-handed handshake (Healy2018Structural). The N-terminal HN domain of COMMD9 has a globular architecture composed of a six-helix bundle with a meander topology, sharing structural similarities with the equivalent domain of COMMD1 (Healy2018Structural).

The COMMD9 protein exhibits a conserved homodimeric structure, with solution structural studies indicating a relatively globular but elongated shape. The COMM domain shows structural similarities to the PH domain of human pleckstrin and the PX domain of yeast Grd19, with a closer match to the Pur-a repeat domain, a whirly-like nucleic acid binding fold (Healy2018Structural). COMMD9 is part of the CCC complex, interacting with proteins like CCDC93 and CCDC22, primarily through the COMM domain (Healy2018Structural).

## Function
COMMD9 is a member of the COMMD protein family, which is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of sodium balance and fluid homeostasis. In healthy human cells, COMMD9 interacts with the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), a critical component for maintaining sodium homeostasis, extracellular fluid volume, and blood pressure regulation. COMMD9 decreases the expression of the βENaC subunit at the cell surface, thereby reducing ENaC activity and modulating sodium transport (Liu2013Functional). This regulatory role is independent of COMMD1, another member of the COMMD family, indicating that COMMD9 can independently influence ENaC activity (Liu2013Functional).

COMMD9 is expressed in the kidney, particularly in the collecting ducts, where it colocalizes with ENaC, suggesting its role as an endogenous regulator of sodium transport in renal cells (Liu2013Functional). The protein is active in both the cytosol and nucleus, as observed in rat kidney cells, indicating its involvement in various cellular compartments (Liu2013Functional). Through these interactions, COMMD9 contributes to the fine-tuning of sodium reabsorption and blood pressure maintenance, highlighting its importance in maintaining physiological homeostasis (Liu2013Functional).

## Clinical Significance
COMMD9 has been implicated in various cancers, particularly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In NSCLC, COMMD9 expression is upregulated, promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Knocking down COMMD9 in NSCLC cells results in G1/S cell cycle arrest, induces autophagy, and enhances the p53 signaling pathway, which collectively exert an antitumor effect (Zhan2017COMMD9; You2023COMMD). COMMD9 interacts with TFDP1, facilitating the transcriptional activity of the TFDP1/E2F1 complex, which is crucial for cancer progression (Zhan2017COMMD9).

In HCC, COMMD9 is also overexpressed, with higher levels correlating with advanced tumor grade and shorter overall survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Wang2021Transcriptional). The gene's expression is linked to clinicopathological parameters, indicating its role in tumor progression (Wang2021Transcriptional).

COMMD9 is also involved in copper homeostasis, with deficiencies leading to hepatic copper accumulation in mice, although specific diseases related to COMMD9 mutations in humans are not detailed (Singla2021Regulation). These findings highlight COMMD9's significance in cancer biology and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
COMMD9, a member of the COMMD protein family, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It is a component of the CCC complex, which is essential for endosomal trafficking. COMMD9 interacts directly with CCDC93, a critical component of the CCC complex, primarily through the N-terminal calponin homology (NN-CH) domain of CCDC93. This interaction involves the conserved WRVD motif in the COMM domain of COMMD9 (Healy2018Structural). COMMD9 also forms homo- and heterodimeric complexes with other COMMD proteins through its C-terminal COMM domain, which is sufficient for these interactions (Healy2018Structural).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), COMMD9 interacts with the TFDP1 protein via its COMM domain, which is necessary for the activation of TFDP1/E2F1 transcriptional activity. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of cell proliferation and migration in NSCLC cells (Zhan2017COMMD9). COMMD9 also interacts with the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), where it reduces amiloride-sensitive current and decreases ENaC expression at the cell surface, indicating a regulatory role in sodium transport (Liu2013Functional). These interactions highlight COMMD9's role in diverse cellular pathways and its potential impact on disease processes.
