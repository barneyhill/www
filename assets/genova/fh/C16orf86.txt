# C16orf86

## Overview
C16orf86 is a gene located on chromosome 16 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 16 open reading frame 86. This protein is currently categorized as an uncharacterized protein, meaning its specific biological functions and roles within cellular processes remain largely undefined (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Despite the limited understanding of its precise functions, C16orf86 has garnered attention in the field of oncology due to its potential prognostic significance in certain cancers, such as pancreatic adenocarcinoma and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma. The expression levels of C16orf86 have been correlated with disease-free survival and overall survival in these cancer types, suggesting its utility as a biomarker for disease prognosis (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Further research is necessary to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and pathways involving C16orf86, which could enhance its application in clinical settings.

## Clinical Significance
C16orf86 has been identified as part of a panel of seven genes with prognostic significance in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC). In these cancers, low expression levels of C16orf86 are associated with unfavorable disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), indicating its potential role as a prognostic biomarker (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). The exclusion of C16orf86 and the other six genes from analysis significantly decreases the prognostic significance of the remaining genes, underscoring its importance in these cancer types (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

While C16orf86 is part of a gene expression signature that could have prognostic or predictive significance in disease dynamics or tumor responses to therapeutics, specific details about its clinical significance remain limited (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). The study emphasizes the potential of ORF genes, including C16orf86, in forming multigene transcriptomic panels for predicting disease outcomes, although the exact mechanisms and interactions of C16orf86 in cancer are not fully elucidated (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Further research is needed to explore the functional roles and clinical implications of C16orf86 in cancer and other diseases.
