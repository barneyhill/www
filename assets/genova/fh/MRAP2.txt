# MRAP2

## Overview
MRAP2 (melanocortin 2 receptor accessory protein 2) is a gene that encodes a single-pass transmembrane protein involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis and body weight. The MRAP2 protein is categorized as a receptor accessory protein, playing a pivotal role in modulating the activity of several G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), including the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) and the ghrelin receptor (GHSR1a) (Srisai2017MRAP2; Bernard2023MRAP2). It is essential for the proper trafficking and functional signaling of these receptors, particularly in the context of energy balance and appetite regulation. MRAP2's interactions with these receptors are crucial for maintaining energy homeostasis, and its dysfunction is implicated in metabolic disorders such as obesity (Srisai2017MRAP2; Rouault2020The). The gene's evolutionary conservation across species underscores its biological significance (Webb2010Minireview:).

## Structure
MRAP2 (melanocortin 2 receptor accessory protein 2) is a single transmembrane domain protein with 27% sequence identity to MRAPα, its paralog. The protein is characterized by a conserved N-terminal domain and is capable of forming antiparallel homodimers or heterodimers with MRAP, which is crucial for its function in trafficking the melanocortin 2 receptor (MC2R) to the cell surface (Webb2010Minireview:). The antiparallel dimerization domain is conserved, indicating its importance in the protein's structural integrity and function (Webb2010Minireview:).

MRAP2 undergoes post-translational modifications, including N-glycosylation. A glycosylation mutant of MRAP2 can still traffic MC2R to the cell surface but fails to support functional signaling, suggesting that glycosylation is critical for its signaling role (Webb2010Minireview:). The protein's structure is similar to other receptor accessory proteins, with conservation primarily in the N-terminus and transmembrane regions, which are essential for its interaction with MC2R (Webb2010Minireview:). The evolutionary conservation of MRAP2 across species, with significant sequence identity between human and other species like mouse and fugu, highlights its functional importance (Webb2010Minireview:).

## Function
MRAP2 (melanocortin 2 receptor accessory protein 2) is a single-pass transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of energy homeostasis and body weight by modulating the activity of several G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) and the ghrelin receptor (GHSR1a) (Srisai2017MRAP2; Bernard2023MRAP2). In healthy human cells, MRAP2 is essential for the ciliary localization of MC4R, which is necessary for its function in suppressing feeding behavior and maintaining energy balance. This localization occurs in the primary cilia of neurons, particularly in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (Bernard2023MRAP2).

MRAP2 also interacts with GHSR1a, enhancing ghrelin-stimulated signaling, which is crucial for hunger sensing and energy expenditure. It modulates both biased signaling and constitutive activity of GHSR1a by affecting G protein and β-arrestin pathways (Rouault2020The). MRAP2's role in these processes highlights its importance in regulating appetite and energy homeostasis, with its dysfunction potentially contributing to obesity and related metabolic disorders (Srisai2017MRAP2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MRAP2 gene are associated with several metabolic disorders, primarily characterized by obesity. Loss-of-function mutations in MRAP2 have been linked to hyperphagic obesity, a condition marked by excessive hunger, hyperglycemia, and hypertension. These mutations are pathogenic and result in impaired signaling of melanocortin receptors, particularly MC4R, which plays a crucial role in energy homeostasis (M2020Lossoffunction). Individuals with MRAP2 mutations often exhibit abnormal eating behaviors, such as overeating and bulimia, and have a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome, including high adiposity, hyperglycemia, and hypertension (M2020Lossoffunction).

MRAP2 mutations can also lead to impaired glucose homeostasis due to their deleterious effects on pancreatic beta cells, contributing to conditions like hyperglycemia (M2020Lossoffunction). The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the brain and pancreatic islets, and its deficiency affects multiple metabolic pathways, potentially through disrupted GPCR signaling (M2020Lossoffunction; Novoselova2018Pathophysiology).

In Brazilian patients, a specific MRAP2 variant, p.Arg125Cys, has been identified in individuals with severe obesity, suggesting its role in disrupting MC4R/MC3R signaling and contributing to the development of obesity (da2020Study).

## Interactions
MRAP2 is known to interact with various G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), playing a significant role in modulating their signaling pathways. It interacts with the melanocortin 2 receptor (MC2R), facilitating its trafficking to the cell surface and enabling it to respond to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (Chan2009MRAP). MRAP2 also interacts with all melanocortin receptors (MCRs) and can form both homodimers and heterodimers with MRAP (Chan2009MRAP).

In the context of energy metabolism, MRAP2 interacts with the melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1), forming a functional complex that influences energy homeostasis and feeding behavior (Wang2022Determination). This interaction is particularly significant in the hypothalamus, where MRAP2 and MCHR1 expression is correlated (Wang2022Determination).

MRAP2 also modulates the signaling of the ghrelin receptor GHSR1a by enhancing Gαq-dependent pathways and inhibiting β-arrestin recruitment, which affects hunger sensing and energy balance (Srisai2017MRAP2; Rouault2020The). Additionally, MRAP2 interacts with prokineticin receptors, inhibiting β-arrestin-2 recruitment to prokineticin receptor 2 (PKR2), which may have implications for obesity treatment (Lattanzi2024MRAP2).
