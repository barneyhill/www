# MAN2B1

## Overview
The MAN2B1 gene encodes the lysosomal enzyme mannosidase alpha class 2B member 1, which is crucial for the degradation of glycoproteins within lysosomes. This enzyme, categorized as a hydrolase, specifically hydrolyzes terminal mannose residues from N-linked oligosaccharides, playing a vital role in the catabolism of complex carbohydrates (Beccari2017Lysosomal). The MAN2B1 protein is a zinc-dependent enzyme that functions optimally at an acidic pH and is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis by preventing the accumulation of mannose-rich oligosaccharides (Beccari2017Lysosomal). Mutations in the MAN2B1 gene can lead to alpha-mannosidosis, a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by a range of clinical symptoms, including intellectual disability and skeletal abnormalities (Beccari2017Lysosomal). Additionally, alterations in MAN2B1 expression have been implicated in cancer, particularly gliomas, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Lin2022Immune).

## Structure
The MAN2B1 gene encodes the lysosomal α-mannosidase enzyme, which is involved in the degradation of glycan moieties on N-glycosylated proteins. The mature human MAN2B1 protein is a dimer consisting of 1011 amino acids and is post-translationally modified through N-glycosylation and disulfide bond formation (Kuokkanen2011Molecular). The protein structure includes a seven-stranded active site α/β domain connected by a three-helix bundle to three β-domains (Kuokkanen2011Molecular). The active site is zinc-dependent, with a reaction nucleophile, D196, crucial for its enzymatic activity (Kuokkanen2011Molecular).

The human MAN2B1 protein has 11 glycosylation sites, with 8 conserved in the bovine sequence, although these were excluded from the model due to incomplete structural data (Kuokkanen2011Molecular). The protein's tertiary structure is modeled based on the bovine MAN2B1 structure, which shares 80% sequence identity, making it a suitable template for homology modeling (Kuokkanen2011Molecular). The model describes 903 residues of the human protein, with 91.2% in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot, indicating a high-quality three-dimensional model (Kuokkanen2011Molecular). The protein's quaternary structure involves dimerization, which is essential for its stability and function (Kuokkanen2011Molecular).

## Function
The MAN2B1 gene encodes the enzyme lysosomal alpha-mannosidase, which plays a crucial role in the catabolism of glycoproteins within lysosomes. This enzyme is responsible for the hydrolysis of terminal mannose residues from N-linked oligosaccharides, facilitating the breakdown of complex carbohydrates (Beccari2017Lysosomal). The enzyme operates optimally at an acidic pH of 4.5 and is activated by Zn2+ ions (Beccari2017Lysosomal). 

In healthy human cells, lysosomal alpha-mannosidase ensures the proper degradation of mannose-rich oligosaccharides, preventing their accumulation and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Beccari2017Lysosomal). The enzyme is synthesized as a precursor and undergoes proteolytic processing to form smaller polypeptides, which are active in the lysosome (Beccari2017Lysosomal). 

The MAN2B1 protein is expressed in various tissues, with the highest levels found in the lung, kidney, pancreas, and liver (Beccari2017Lysosomal). Its activity is essential for normal cellular functions related to glycoprotein processing and degradation, and its deficiency can lead to lysosomal storage disorders such as alpha-mannosidosis (Beccari2017Lysosomal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MAN2B1 gene lead to alpha-mannosidosis, a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder. This condition is characterized by a deficiency in lysosomal alpha-mannosidase activity, resulting in the accumulation of mannose-rich oligosaccharides in tissues. Clinical manifestations include intellectual disability, skeletal abnormalities, hearing impairment, immune deficiency, and facial deformities (Kuokkanen2011Molecular; Beccari2017Lysosomal; Lehalle2019Hearing). The disorder presents in three phenotypes—mild, moderate, and severe—based on the age of onset and symptom severity (Beccari2017Lysosomal).

The MAN2B1 gene has been associated with over 155 mutations, including missense, nonsense, and splicing site mutations, with the p.R750W mutation being notably frequent (Beccari2017Lysosomal; Riise2012Identification). These mutations can affect enzyme folding and transport, impacting clinical outcomes (Kuokkanen2011Molecular). Enzyme replacement therapy, such as LAMZEDE, has been approved in Europe to treat this condition (Lehalle2019Hearing).

Alterations in MAN2B1 expression have also been linked to cancer, particularly gliomas, where it is over-expressed and associated with tumor aggressiveness and immune modulation (Lin2022Immune). This suggests that MAN2B1 could serve as a prognostic biomarker for glioma.
