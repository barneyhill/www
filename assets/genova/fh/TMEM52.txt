# TMEM52

## Overview
TMEM52 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 52, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including those related to cell signaling and structural integrity. TMEM52 has been studied for its role in several diseases, with particular attention to its expression and methylation patterns, which have implications in conditions such as glioblastoma, Rett syndrome, and obesity-related syndromes. The gene's expression is notably influenced by epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, which can affect its function and potential as a therapeutic target (Wang2020Development; D’Angelo2012Copy; Veeraragavan2016Loss). Additionally, TMEM52's involvement in oncogenesis, particularly in Epstein-Barr virus-positive gastric cancer, underscores its significance in cancer research (Saito2021Landscape).

## Clinical Significance
TMEM52 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression and methylation patterns. In glioblastoma (GBM), TMEM52 is identified as a methylation-driven gene with significant prognostic value. High methylation levels of TMEM52 correlate with better survival outcomes, while its low expression is associated with a more favorable prognosis in GBM patients (Wang2020Development). The gene is part of a prognostic risk score model that predicts overall survival in GBM, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target due to the reversible nature of DNA methylation (Wang2020Development).

In the context of Rett syndrome (RTT), TMEM52 is uniquely up-regulated in the hypothalamus of Mecp2-deficient rat models, suggesting its involvement in the molecular alterations associated with RTT (Veeraragavan2016Loss).

TMEM52 is also associated with obesity-related syndromes. It is located within a critical interval on chromosome 1p36, linked to hyperphagia and obesity, and is expressed during embryonic development, including in the brain (D’Angelo2012Copy).

In Epstein-Barr virus-positive gastric cancer, TMEM52 undergoes hypermethylation, which is associated with gene silencing, indicating its role in the oncogenesis and progression of this cancer type (Saito2021Landscape).
