# ATP2A3

## Overview
The ATP2A3 gene encodes the ATPase sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ transporting 3 protein, commonly referred to as SERCA3. This protein is a member of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase family, which is integral to the regulation of intracellular calcium levels by facilitating the transport of Ca2+ ions across the sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum membranes. SERCA3 is categorized as a transmembrane protein due to its structure, which includes a transmembrane domain essential for its function in calcium transport. The gene undergoes alternative splicing to produce multiple isoforms, including SERCA3a, SERCA3b, and SERCA3c, each with distinct C-terminal regions. These isoforms play a critical role in maintaining calcium homeostasis, which is vital for various cellular processes such as muscle contraction, secretion, and cell signaling. The expression and regulation of ATP2A3 have significant implications in health and disease, particularly in the context of cancer, where alterations in its expression are associated with tumorigenesis and cancer progression (Brouland2005The; Meneses‐Morales2019Epigenetic; Dode1998Structure).

## Structure
The ATP2A3 gene encodes the SERCA3 protein, a member of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase family, responsible for transporting Ca2+ ions across the sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum membranes. The primary structure of SERCA3 isoforms, including SERCA3a, SERCA3b, and SERCA3c, is identical for the first 993 amino acids, with variations in the C-terminal region: SERCA3a has 5 or 6 additional amino acids, SERCA3b has 50, and SERCA3c has 36 (Dode2002Dissection). These isoforms are products of alternative splicing of the ATP2A3 gene.

The SERCA3 protein contains a transmembrane domain composed of 10 helices, which house the Ca2+ transport sites, and a cytosolic headpiece that includes nucleotide-binding, phosphorylation, and actuator domains essential for ATP hydrolysis and Ca2+ transport (AguayoOrtiz2020Linking). The protein undergoes significant conformational changes during its catalytic cycle, transitioning between high-Ca2+ affinity (E1) and low-Ca2+ affinity (E2) states (AguayoOrtiz2020Linking). These structural transitions are crucial for its function in calcium homeostasis.

SERCA3 isoforms exhibit lower Ca2+ affinity compared to other SERCA isoforms, which may be due to alterations in the E1 to E2 equilibrium during ion translocation (Corvazier2009Expression). The protein's function and regulation are influenced by interactions with various ions and regulatory proteins, although specific details on post-translational modifications are not provided in the context.

## Function
The ATP2A3 gene encodes the SERCA3 protein, a type of sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase involved in the transport of calcium ions across the sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum membranes. This protein plays a crucial role in maintaining calcium homeostasis within cells by pumping Ca2+ from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum, which is essential for various cellular functions such as secretion, contraction, metabolism, neuronal plasticity, and gene transcription (Dode1998Structure; Martin2002Three).

SERCA3 is expressed in a variety of tissues, including hematopoietic cells, arterial endothelial and secretory epithelial cells, and cerebellar Purkinje neurons. It is co-expressed with the ubiquitous SERCA2b isoform but has a lower apparent affinity for Ca2+ compared to other SERCA family members (Chandrasekera2009Determination; Dode1998Structure). The protein's activity is not regulated by accessory proteins like phospholamban, which distinguishes it from other SERCA isoforms (Chandrasekera2009Determination).

The SERCA3 isoforms, including SERCA3a, SERCA3b, and SERCA3c, exhibit different affinities for Ca2+ and are involved in modulating cytosolic and endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ concentrations, suggesting a broader role in cellular Ca2+ signaling than previously understood (Dode2002Dissection; Martin2002Three).

## Clinical Significance
The ATP2A3 gene, encoding the SERCA3 protein, plays a significant role in various cancers due to its involvement in calcium homeostasis. In colon cancer, the loss of SERCA3 expression is an early event in carcinogenesis, correlating with decreased cell differentiation and tumor progression. This loss is linked to the β-catenin signaling pathway and Sp1/Kruppel-like factor-dependent transcription, suggesting its potential as a marker for early tumorigenesis (Brouland2005The).

In gastric and colon cancers, ATP2A3 expression is often downregulated, with epigenetic modifications such as methylation and acetylation affecting its expression. Treatments with HDAC and DNMT inhibitors have been shown to increase SERCA3 expression, indicating the potential for therapeutic interventions targeting these epigenetic changes (Meneses‐Morales2019Epigenetic).

In breast cancer, high ATP2A3 expression is associated with reduced survival rates, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker. The differential expression of ATP2A3 in various breast cancer subtypes suggests its involvement in cancer progression and patient outcomes (Christodoulou2021Altered).

Mutations in ATP2A3 have also been identified in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, suggesting a role in cancer susceptibility, although the exact mechanisms remain unclear (Korošec2008Alterations).

## Interactions
The ATP2A3 gene encodes the SERCA3b protein, which is involved in calcium transport across the sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum membranes. SERCA3b interacts with the Bcl-2 protein, a known regulator of apoptosis and calcium homeostasis. Bcl-2 binds to SERCA3b, inhibiting its activity and inducing conformational changes. This interaction affects the distribution of SERCA3b within membrane domains and its ATPase activity, leading to partial inactivation (Hewarathna2017Inhibition).

The interaction between Bcl-2 and SERCA3b is significant for Bcl-2's anti-apoptotic function, as demonstrated by the lack of SERCA3b inactivation by a Bcl-2 mutant that abolishes its anti-apoptotic role (Hewarathna2017Inhibition). Bcl-2's interaction with SERCA3b can also be modulated by heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), suggesting a complex regulatory mechanism (Hewarathna2017Inhibition).

Additionally, biotin supplementation has been shown to decrease the expression of the SERCA3 gene, affecting calcium sequestration in the endoplasmic reticulum and triggering the unfolded protein response (Griffin2006Biotin).
