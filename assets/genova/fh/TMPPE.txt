# TMPPE

## Overview
The TMPPE gene encodes a transmembrane protein characterized by a metallophosphoesterase domain, which categorizes it as a hydrolase enzyme. This protein is integral to cellular processes that involve the hydrolysis of phosphoester bonds, thereby playing a significant role in signal transduction and cellular communication. The TMPPE protein is localized in the nucleoplasm and mitochondria, indicating its involvement in critical intracellular processes within these compartments (Attwood2021Characterization; Liachko2019Genome). While its precise functions in healthy human cells are not yet fully understood, TMPPE is believed to contribute to the regulation of metabolic pathways and cellular homeostasis. Its potential role in modulating cellular responses to stimuli suggests that it may be significant in various physiological and pathological contexts (Liachko2019Genome). Further research is necessary to elucidate the detailed mechanisms and functions of TMPPE in human biology (Attwood2021Characterization).

## Structure


## Function
The TMPPE gene encodes a transmembrane protein with a metallophosphoesterase domain, which is associated with hydrolase activity. This protein is involved in cellular processes that require the hydrolysis of phosphoester bonds, playing a role in signal transduction and cellular communication (Attwood2021Characterization; Liachko2019Genome). TMPPE is localized in the nucleoplasm and mitochondria, suggesting its involvement in processes within these cellular compartments (Attwood2021Characterization).

In the context of cell biology, TMPPE is implicated in maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper physiological function. Its activity is crucial for the regulation of metabolic pathways, although the specific molecular processes it influences in healthy human cells remain not fully characterized (Attwood2021Characterization; Liachko2019Genome). The protein's role in signal transduction pathways indicates its potential involvement in modulating cellular responses to various stimuli, which could be significant in understanding its function in disease contexts (Liachko2019Genome).

Despite its recognized importance, the precise functions and mechanisms of TMPPE in healthy human cells require further research to be fully elucidated (Attwood2021Characterization).
