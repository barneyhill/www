# DDHD1

## Overview
DDHD1 is a gene that encodes the DDHD domain containing 1 protein, which functions as a phosphatidic acid-preferring phospholipase A1 (PA-PLA1). This enzyme is a member of the intracellular phospholipase A1 family and plays a critical role in lipid metabolism by hydrolyzing phosphatidic acid and other glycerophospholipids. The DDHD1 protein is predominantly expressed in the brain and testes, where it is involved in intracellular membrane trafficking and lipid signaling. It is partially localized to the mitochondria, contributing to mitochondrial function and lipid metabolism, particularly in the remodeling of cardiolipin, a key mitochondrial phospholipid. The proper functioning of DDHD1 is essential for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and is implicated in processes such as spermatogenesis. Mutations in the DDHD1 gene are linked to neurodegenerative disorders, including Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia type 28 (SPG28), highlighting its clinical significance (Liguori2014Impairment; Yaginuma2022Current; Rajasekharan2016DDHD).

## Structure


## Function
The DDHD1 gene encodes a phosphatidic acid-preferring phospholipase A1 (PA-PLA1), which is part of the intracellular phospholipase A1 family. This enzyme is involved in lipid metabolism, specifically in the hydrolysis of phosphatidic acid (PA) and other glycerophospholipids (GPLs) (Liguori2014Impairment; Yaginuma2022Current). DDHD1 is highly expressed in the brain and testes, playing a significant role in intracellular membrane trafficking and lipid signaling (Yaginuma2022Current; Rajasekharan2016DDHD).

In healthy human cells, DDHD1 is partially localized to the mitochondria, where it is crucial for mitochondrial function and lipid metabolism. It is involved in the remodeling of cardiolipin, a key phospholipid in the mitochondria, through a deacylation-transacylation cycle. This process is essential for maintaining proper mitochondrial inner membrane potential and protein import (Rajasekharan2016DDHD). DDHD1 also plays a role in spermatogenesis, as evidenced by studies showing that DDHD1-deficient mice have abnormally shaped sperm, potentially due to mitochondrial dysregulation (Yaginuma2022Current).

The DDHD1 protein's activity is necessary for the optimal regulation of cardiolipin metabolism, and its misregulation can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, which is associated with various neurodegenerative disorders (Rajasekharan2016DDHD).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DDHD1 gene are associated with Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia type 28 (SPG28), a subtype of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). This group of neurodegenerative disorders is characterized by progressive spasticity and weakness in the lower limbs. The clinical phenotype of SPG28 includes axonal neuropathy, distal sensory loss, and cerebellar eye movement disturbances (Liguori2014Impairment; Wortmann2014Inborn). 

Mutations in DDHD1 lead to early protein truncation, resulting in a loss of function of the DDHD1 protein, which is a phosphatidic acid-preferring phospholipase A1. This loss of function is linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired energy metabolism in the brain and skeletal muscle, potentially due to modifications in mitochondrial lipid content (Liguori2014Impairment). 

DDHD1 mutations have also been associated with a complex form of HSP that includes retinal dystrophy and neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA), expanding the clinical spectrum of disorders linked to this gene (Dard2017Mutations). These mutations can lead to intracellular membrane trafficking issues, mitochondrial morphology and function abnormalities, and lipid metabolism disorders, contributing to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (Rajasekharan2016DDHD).
