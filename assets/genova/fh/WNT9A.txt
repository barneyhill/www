# WNT9A

## Overview
WNT9A is a gene that encodes the protein Wnt family member 9A, which is part of the Wnt family of secreted signaling proteins. These proteins are integral to various developmental processes, including cell fate determination, proliferation, and migration, primarily through their involvement in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Wnt family member 9A is a secreted protein that plays a critical role in embryonic development, tissue homeostasis, and bone formation. It is particularly significant in the regulation of pancreatic endocrine differentiation and hematopoietic stem cell development. The protein interacts with several receptors and co-receptors, such as Frizzled, LRP5/6, and EGFR, to mediate its signaling functions. Alterations in the WNT9A gene have been linked to various clinical conditions, including thumb osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and colorectal cancer, highlighting its importance in both normal physiology and disease states (Dai2024Genetic; Ali2016Wnt9A; Grainger2016Wnt9a; Pujadas2016Wnt9a; Teufel2021Loss; Richter2018WNT9A).

## Function
WNT9A is a member of the Wnt gene family, which encodes secreted signaling proteins that play a crucial role in various developmental processes. In healthy human cells, WNT9A is involved in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is essential for regulating cell fate, proliferation, and migration. This pathway influences gene expression and cellular responses, contributing to embryonic development, tissue homeostasis, and bone formation (Richter2018WNT9A).

In the context of pancreatic development, WNT9A is expressed in the embryonic pancreas and is involved in the regulation of endocrine differentiation. It acts as a negative feedback mechanism to limit the activity of the transcription factor Neurogenin3 (Neurog3), which is crucial for pancreatic endocrine differentiation. WNT9A deficiency leads to an increased number of endocrine cells, suggesting its role in fine-tuning the activation of the endocrine program (Pujadas2016Wnt9a).

WNT9A also plays a significant role in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell development. It is required for the efficient differentiation of these cells, acting in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In zebrafish, WNT9A is secreted by somites and acts on the developing hemogenic endothelium, promoting hematopoietic differentiation (Grainger2016Wnt9a; Richter2018WNT9A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the WNT9A gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of thumb osteoarthritis (TOA), genetic polymorphisms in WNT9A, particularly the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs11588850, have been associated with an increased risk of the disease. The G allele of rs11588850 is linked to higher enhancer activity, leading to upregulation of WNT9A expression, which may contribute to the development of TOA (Dai2024Genetic). This upregulation has been observed in synovium tissues of TOA patients, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of the condition (Dai2024Genetic).

In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the loss of WNT9A has been shown to exacerbate symptoms in mouse models, indicating its potential protective role against inflammation and joint destruction. WNT9A deficiency creates a proinflammatory environment, enhancing TNF-mediated inflammation and promoting joint destruction (Teufel2021Loss). The gene's involvement in modulating inflammatory and catabolic responses highlights its significance in RA pathology (Teufel2021Loss).

In colorectal cancer, WNT9A acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cell proliferation through the suppression of β-catenin expression, a key component of the canonical Wnt pathway (Ali2016Wnt9A).

## Interactions
WNT9A interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in various signaling pathways. It is involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, where it interacts with the Frizzled receptor Fzd9b and co-receptors LRP5/6 and EGFR. This interaction is essential for β-catenin signaling, a part of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. The endocytosis of the Wnt9a/Fzd9b complex, initiated by EGFR-mediated phosphorylation, is necessary for the signaling process, which involves caveolin and EPS15-dependent pathways (Nguyen2022EGFRinitiated).

WNT9A also forms a signaling complex with EGFR and Fzd9b, which is crucial for hematopoietic stem cell development. EGFR acts as a co-factor, phosphorylating Fzd9b and facilitating Wnt9a signal transduction. This interaction is specific to Wnt9a and Fzd9b, as demonstrated in both zebrafish and human cells (Grainger2018EGFR).

In skeletal development, WNT9A interacts with receptor tyrosine kinases Ror1 and Ror2. These interactions are significant for limb skeleton and palate development, with genetic interactions between Wnt9a and Ror2 leading to severe skeletal dysplasia in double mutants (Weissenböck2019Genetic).
