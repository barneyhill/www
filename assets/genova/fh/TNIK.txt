# TNIK

## Overview
TNIK (TRAF2 and NCK interacting kinase) is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase, which is a member of the germinal center kinase (GCK) family. The protein product of TNIK is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of the cytoskeleton and activation of signaling pathways such as the Wnt/β-catenin and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways. TNIK plays a crucial role in cellular signaling by interacting with multiple proteins, including TCF4, β-catenin, and TRAF6, thereby influencing gene expression and cytoskeletal organization. It is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, impacting neuronal development, immune responses, and cancer progression. Mutations in the TNIK gene have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and certain cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Jiang2024Mutations; Fu1999TNIK; Shkoda2012The).

## Structure
TNIK (TRAF2 and NCK interacting kinase) is a serine/threonine kinase that belongs to the germinal center kinase (GCK) family. It is a 1360-residue protein characterized by an N-terminal kinase domain, an intermediate domain, and a C-terminal citron homology (CNH) domain (KukimotoNiino2022Structural). The kinase domain of TNIK has a two-lobed structure, consisting of N- and C-lobes, which is typical of protein kinases. The deep cleft between these lobes serves as an ATP-binding site, which is a target for small molecule inhibitors (KukimotoNiino2022Structural).

The TNIK kinase domain can exist in two distinct conformations: a closed, active conformation and an open, inactive conformation. These conformations are influenced by the position of the αC-helix in the N-lobe of the kinase domain (KukimotoNiino2022Structural). Structural studies have shown that the TNIK kinase domain can transition from an inactive conformation with an open ATP-binding cleft to a closed, active conformation upon ligand binding, which stabilizes the active state (KukimotoNiino2022Structural).

TNIK is involved in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, where it interacts with TCF4 and β-catenin, phosphorylating TCF4 at serine 154. This kinase activity is crucial for colorectal cancer growth (KukimotoNiino2022Structural).

## Function
TNIK (TRAF2 and NCK interacting kinase) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of the cytoskeleton and activation of signaling pathways. In healthy human cells, TNIK is involved in activating the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, which is crucial for stress response and apoptosis. This activation is mediated by the C-terminal germinal center kinase homology (GCKH) domain of TNIK, which is necessary and sufficient for JNK activation (Fu1999TNIK).

TNIK also regulates the cytoskeleton by interacting with proteins such as Traf2 and NCK, and it can phosphorylate the actin-fragmenting protein Gelsolin, indicating its role in cytoskeletal dynamics (Fu1999TNIK). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences gene expression and cytoskeletal organization, impacting neuronal development and immune responses (Shkoda2012The).

In the context of T cells, TNIK is involved in the CD27/TNIK/Wnt signaling pathway, which supports the differentiation and metabolic reprogramming of CD8+ T cells, favoring symmetric division and memory T-cell enrichment (JaegerRuckstuhl2020TNIK). TNIK's involvement in these pathways highlights its importance in maintaining cellular structure and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TNIK gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) and certain cancers. In the context of NDDs, TNIK mutations, such as the p.Arg180* (R180X) and K54R variants, result in a loss of protein kinase activity, leading to intellectual developmental disorder (IDD), delayed speech, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These mutations disrupt synaptic signaling and neuronal activity, affecting synapse development and contributing to developmental delays and intellectual disabilities (Jiang2024Mutations).

In cancer, TNIK plays a significant role in the progression of osteosarcoma and colorectal cancer. In osteosarcoma, TNIK is essential for maintaining the stem cell phenotype, and its inhibition can suppress tumor growth and induce differentiation into adipocyte-like cells. This suggests TNIK as a potential therapeutic target for osteosarcoma (Hirozane2021Direct). In colorectal cancer, TNIK interacts with T-cell factor-4 (TCF4) in the Wnt signaling pathway, promoting cancer cell proliferation. Inhibition of TNIK reduces tumor growth, highlighting its potential as a target for pharmacological intervention in colorectal cancer (Shitashige2010Traf2).

## Interactions
TNIK (TRAF2 and NCK interacting kinase) is involved in various protein interactions that play critical roles in cellular signaling pathways. TNIK interacts with the HMG box transcription factor Tcf7l2 and forms a ternary complex with Tcf7l2 and β-catenin, which modulates the transcriptional activation of Wnt target genes (Coba2012TNiK). It also binds to DISC1 and GSK3β, forming complexes crucial for neurogenesis and synaptic signaling (Coba2012TNiK).

TNIK is a component of the TRAF6/TAK1/TAB2/IKKb complex, essential for JNK and canonical NF-kB signaling pathways. It interacts directly with TRAF6, facilitating its role in signaling pathways activated by the EBV oncoprotein LMP1 and the CD40 receptor (Shkoda2012The). TNIK also interacts with TRAF2 and NCK, with the intermediate domain of TNIK being sufficient for these interactions (Fu1999TNIK).

In the context of glutamate receptor function, TNIK is part of NMDAR complexes and is linked to GluN1 through AKAP9. This interaction is crucial for synaptic transmission and plasticity (Coba2012TNiK). TNIK's interactions with these proteins highlight its role in various signaling pathways and its potential implications in neuropsychiatric diseases.
