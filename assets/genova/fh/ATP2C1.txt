# ATP2C1

## Overview
The ATP2C1 gene encodes the ATPase secretory pathway Ca2+ transporting 1 (SPCA1), a P-type ATPase protein that plays a critical role in cellular ion homeostasis. SPCA1 is primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it facilitates the transport of calcium and manganese ions, essential for various cellular processes, including protein processing and trafficking (Micaroni2016ATP2C1; Missiaen2007Calcium). The protein's structure is characterized by multiple domains, including transmembrane helices that are crucial for its ion transport function (Btadini2015Identification). SPCA1 is involved in maintaining the undifferentiated state of keratinocytes and is implicated in epidermal cell adhesion and differentiation (Yoshida2006ATP2C1). Mutations in ATP2C1 are linked to Hailey-Hailey disease, a genetic disorder affecting skin integrity (DobsonStone2002HaileyHailey).

## Structure
The ATP2C1 gene encodes the secretory pathway Ca2+/Mn2+-ATPase pump type 1 (SPCA1), which is localized at the Golgi apparatus. The SPCA1 protein structure includes an actuator domain (A), phosphorylation domain (P), nucleotide-binding domain (N), five stalk helices (S) in the cytoplasm, and ten transmembrane helices (M) (Micaroni2016ATP2C1). The protein is involved in calcium and manganese ion transport, crucial for maintaining Golgi luminal Ca2+ homeostasis (Hamada2008Molecular).

SPCA1 is produced in four distinct isoforms through alternative splicing: SPCA1a, SPCA1b, SPCA1c, and SPCA1d. These isoforms differ in their C-terminal cytosolic tails, which may have specific functions, including interactions with PDZ domains and involvement in various signaling pathways (Micaroni2016ATP2C1). The C-terminal tails of SPCA1 isoforms contain motifs like the KXD/E motif, which is located in a helical extension of the M10 transmembrane helix in isoforms SPCA1a, SPCA1b, and SPCA1d, indicating a possible role in protein interactions (Micaroni2016ATP2C1).

The SPCA1 protein's structure is similar to that of SERCA1, another P-type ATPase, and is involved in calcium transport, specifically pumping Ca2+ from the cytosol to the Golgi apparatus (Hamada2008Molecular). The presence of transmembrane domains is essential for its ion transport function (Btadini2015Identification).

## Function
The ATP2C1 gene encodes a calcium/manganese-transporting ATPase, specifically localized in the Golgi apparatus, which plays a crucial role in maintaining calcium and manganese homeostasis within cells. This protein, known as SPCA1, is essential for the proper functioning of the Golgi apparatus by supplying it with necessary ions, facilitating various enzymatic reactions critical for protein processing and trafficking (Missiaen2007Calcium; RamosCastañeda2005Deficiency). In keratinocytes, ATP2C1 is particularly important for maintaining the undifferentiated state of basal cells in the epidermis. Its depletion triggers keratinocyte differentiation, indicating its role in epidermal cell adhesion and differentiation (Yoshida2006ATP2C1).

ATP2C1 also plays a significant role in the secretory pathway, impacting processes such as protein folding, post-translational modifications, and intracellular transport. It is involved in the regulation of calcium levels within the Golgi, which is essential for the proper glycosylation of proteins and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis (RamosCastañeda2005Deficiency). The protein's function is critical for the integrity of the skin, as mutations in ATP2C1 are linked to Hailey-Hailey disease, characterized by defects in cell adhesion (Missiaen2007Calcium; Micaroni2016ATP2C1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATP2C1 gene are primarily associated with Hailey-Hailey disease (HHD), also known as familial benign chronic pemphigus. HHD is an autosomal dominant skin disorder characterized by recurrent blisters, erosions, and erythematous plaques, particularly in areas of friction such as the groin, neck, and axillae (Xiao2018A; Zhang2007Eight). The disease results from mutations that disrupt the function of the secretory pathway Ca2+/Mn2+-ATPase 1 (SPCA1), leading to impaired calcium homeostasis in the epidermis and subsequent acantholysis, a key pathological feature of HHD (Sawicka2020Novel; Nellen2017Mendelian).

The mutations in ATP2C1 include missense, nonsense, splice-site, and frameshift mutations, which often result in haploinsufficiency, where a single functional copy of the gene is insufficient to maintain normal function (DobsonStone2002HaileyHailey; Micaroni2016ATP2C1). This haploinsufficiency is thought to be the mechanism underlying the dominant inheritance pattern of HHD (Fairclough2004Hailey–Hailey). The disease typically manifests in the third or fourth decade of life and can be exacerbated by factors such as heat, humidity, and stress (Xiao2018A; Zhang2011Detection).

## Interactions
The ATP2C1 gene encodes the SPCA1 protein, which is involved in several critical interactions within the cell. SPCA1 directly interacts with cofilin-1 (CFL-1), an actin-severing protein, and F-actin. This interaction is essential for the recruitment of F-actin to SPCA1, facilitating calcium (Ca2+) influx into the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and promoting secretory cargo sorting. The binding of CFL-1 to SPCA1 occurs at a specific region in the P-domain of SPCA1, and this interaction is necessary for the activation of SPCA1 and subsequent Ca2+ pumping (Kienzle2014Cofilin).

Mutations in SPCA1 that disrupt its interaction with CFL-1 can impair TGN Ca2+ uptake and secretory cargo sorting, highlighting the importance of these interactions. For instance, a mutant form of SPCA1 lacking certain charged residues fails to rescue the sorting phenotype caused by SPCA1 knockdown, underscoring the critical role of these interactions (Kienzle2014Cofilin).

SPCA1 also interacts with sphingolipids, particularly sphingomyelin, which enhances its Ca2+ pumping activity. This interaction is crucial for defining sorting domains and cargo exit sites within the TGN (Deng2018Activity).
