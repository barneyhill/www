# OOEP

## Overview
OOEP, or oocyte expressed protein, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the subcortical maternal complex (SCMC), which is crucial for early embryonic development. The OOEP protein, also known as FLOPED, is predominantly expressed in oocytes and plays a significant role in the structural organization of the SCMC, facilitating processes essential for zygote development and early embryogenesis. This protein is involved in regulating cell division, maintaining genomic integrity through DNA repair, and ensuring embryo viability. While primarily associated with female reproduction, OOEP is also implicated in male reproductive biology, as its expression is linked to spermatogenesis and male infertility. The protein's interactions within the SCMC, particularly with NLRP5, TLE6, and KHDC3L, underscore its importance in the regulation of translation and spindle assembly during early development (Zhu2014Identification; Monk2017NLRPs; Rockenbach2023Expression).

## Function
The OOEP gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the subcortical maternal complex (SCMC), which is essential for early embryonic development. In healthy human cells, OOEP is primarily expressed in oocytes and is involved in processes critical for the progression beyond the first embryonic cell divisions. It plays a role in the structural organization of the SCMC, which is necessary for zygote development and early embryogenesis (Zhu2014Identification).

OOEP is active in the cytoplasm of oocytes, where it contributes to the regulation of cell division and embryo viability. The protein is involved in DNA repair processes, which are vital for maintaining genomic integrity during early development (Rockenbach2023Expression). The gene's expression is enriched in the human ovary, indicating its specific role in oocyte development and function (Zhu2014Identification).

In addition to its role in female reproduction, OOEP has been observed to be downregulated in male reproductive disorders, suggesting a potential, yet unrecognized, involvement in male reproduction. It is co-expressed with genes related to spermatogenesis and male infertility, indicating its broader implications in human reproductive biology (Rockenbach2023Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the OOEP gene are associated with several reproductive and developmental disorders. Biallelic variants in OOEP can lead to early embryonic developmental arrest and multi-locus imprinting disturbance (MLID), conditions linked to defects in oocyte maturation and early embryonic development, potentially resulting in infertility or developmental issues (Solovova2022Genetics). OOEP is also implicated in MLID, which involves aberrant imprinting marks at multiple differentially methylated regions. This disturbance is associated with various imprinting disorders, such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and Silver-Russell syndrome (Eggermann2022Transacting).

In the context of human reproductive failures, altered expression and interaction patterns of OOEP have been observed. For instance, in patients with recurrent implantation failure (RIF) and recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL), the correlation between OOEP and other subcortical maternal complex (SCMC) genes changes significantly, suggesting altered interactions that may contribute to these conditions (Rockenbach2023Revealing). These findings indicate that disruptions in OOEP expression or its interactions with other SCMC components could play a role in reproductive challenges and imprinting disorders (Elbracht2020Disturbed).

## Interactions
The OOEP protein, also known as FLOPED, is a component of the subcortical maternal complex (SCMC), which is essential for early embryonic development. OOEP physically interacts with several other proteins within the SCMC, including NLRP5, TLE6, and KHDC3L. These interactions have been demonstrated through coimmunoprecipitation experiments, which showed that OOEP, KHDC3L, and full-length TLE6, but not the truncated form of TLE6, are specifically precipitated by NLRP5, indicating a physical interaction (Zhu2014Identification). Reciprocal co-transfections further confirmed these interactions, highlighting the specificity and importance of these protein-protein interactions within the SCMC (Zhu2014Identification).

The SCMC, including OOEP, is involved in the regulation of translation in oocytes and early embryos, and is associated with cytoplasmic lattices (CPLs), which organize and regulate the translational machinery (Bebbere2016The). OOEP's role in the SCMC is crucial for correct spindle assembly and cell division, as it helps control spindle position by regulating F-actin dynamics (Monk2017NLRPs). The interactions within the SCMC are tightly regulated, as genetic ablation of SCMC components, except KHDC3L, destabilizes the complex (Monk2017NLRPs).
