# SELENON

## Overview
SELENON is a gene that encodes the protein selenoprotein N, which is a crucial component in the regulation of redox homeostasis and calcium dynamics within muscle cells. Selenoprotein N is categorized as an integral endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein, where it plays a pivotal role in modulating calcium uptake and release, essential for muscle function and relaxation. The protein interacts with key calcium-regulating components such as the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) pump and the ryanodine receptor (RyR), facilitating proper calcium homeostasis and protecting against oxidative stress (Pozzer2019A; Jurynec2008Selenoprotein). Mutations in the SELENON gene are associated with congenital myopathies, highlighting its significance in muscle development and function (Arbogast2010Selenoproteins).

## Structure


## Function
SELENON, also known as selenoprotein N, is a crucial protein involved in maintaining redox homeostasis and calcium regulation within muscle cells. It is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it plays a significant role in modulating calcium dynamics and protecting against oxidative stress. SELENON interacts with the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) pump, facilitating proper calcium uptake into the ER, which is essential for muscle function and relaxation kinetics (Pozzer2019A). 

SELENON also associates with the ryanodine receptor (RyR), a calcium release channel, and is necessary for its normal activity. This interaction suggests that SELENON is involved in the redox regulation of RyR channels, influencing calcium release and muscle contraction (Jurynec2008Selenoprotein). The protein's role in redox signaling is further highlighted by its ability to reduce hyperoxidized luminal cysteines of SERCA, thereby maintaining ER-mitochondria crosstalk and limiting calcium efflux (Pothion2020Selenoprotein).

SELENON's function is critical for muscle development and differentiation, as its deficiency leads to impaired muscle structure and function, particularly affecting the diaphragm and axial muscles (Pozzer2019A; Arbogast2010Selenoproteins).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SELENON gene, also known as selenoprotein N, are linked to a range of congenital myopathies, including rigid spine muscular dystrophy (RSMD) and multiminicore disease (MmD). These conditions are characterized by muscle weakness, spinal rigidity, and respiratory insufficiency due to diaphragm muscle weakness (Pozzer2019A; Arbogast2009Oxidative). SELENON-related myopathies (SELENON-RMs) present a heterogeneous clinical spectrum, with symptoms such as congenital hypotonia, axial and limb girdle weakness, scoliosis, and delayed respiratory insufficiency (Zhang2021Delayed). 

The pathophysiology of SELENON-related myopathies involves impaired calcium handling and increased oxidative stress in muscle cells. The loss of SELENON leads to dysfunction in highly active muscles, such as the diaphragm, due to a maladaptive endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. This response is characterized by the upregulation of stress markers like CHOP and ERO1, which affect calcium uptake and muscle function (Pozzer2019A; Arbogast2009Oxidative). 

SELENON mutations also result in extramuscular abnormalities, including altered body composition and insulin resistance, suggesting a broader impact on metabolic processes (Clarke2006SEPN1:; Zhang2021Delayed). The variability in clinical presentation and severity indicates that other genetic and environmental factors may influence the disease phenotype (Zhang2021Delayed).

## Interactions
Selenoprotein N (SELENON) is involved in several interactions that are crucial for its function in muscle development and redox homeostasis. SELENON is an integral endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein that interacts with the ryanodine receptor (RyR) and the Sarco/Endoplasmic Reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA), playing a significant role in calcium regulation through redox mechanisms. These interactions influence calcium flux and are essential for maintaining calcium homeostasis in muscle cells (Varlamova2020Protein–protein).

SELENON is also implicated in the regulation of intracellular calcium concentration and protection against oxidative stress. It is suggested that SELENON interacts with RyR1, which is involved in calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and this interaction is crucial for preventing muscle dysfunction (Arbogast2010Selenoproteins).

In the context of protein-nucleic acid interactions, SELENON mRNA is a target of the eIF3 complex, although the binding is not as significant compared to other selenoprotein mRNAs. This interaction suggests a role in the selective regulation of selenoprotein expression, particularly under conditions of metabolic stress (Hayek2022eIF3).
