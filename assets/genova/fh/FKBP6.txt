# FKBP6

## Overview
The FKBP6 gene encodes the FKBP prolyl isomerase family member 6 (inactive) protein, which is a member of the immunophilin family. This protein is characterized by its structural domains, including a prolyl isomerase/FK506-binding domain and three tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, although it is considered inactive in terms of isomerase activity (Kasai2015Involvement; Miyamato2006Is). FKBP6 is primarily expressed in the testis and plays a significant role in reproductive biology, particularly in meiotic chromosome synapsis and spermatogenesis (Miyamato2006Is). Despite its inactivity as an isomerase, FKBP6 functions as a co-chaperone, forming complexes with other proteins involved in cellular processes such as membrane fusion and calcium channel regulation (Raudsepp2012GenomeWide). The gene is located on chromosome 7q11.23 and is implicated in male fertility, with mutations potentially affecting spermatogenic processes and contributing to conditions like azoospermia (Raudsepp2012GenomeWide; Miyamato2006Is).

## Structure
The FKBP6 protein, encoded by the FKBP6 gene, is a member of the immunophilin family and is characterized by its structural domains and potential functional roles. It contains a prolyl isomerase/FK506-binding domain, although it is considered inactive in terms of isomerase activity (Kasai2015Involvement; Miyamato2006Is). The protein also features three tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which are crucial for protein-protein interactions and the formation of multiprotein complexes (Zhang2007Mutation; Raudsepp2012GenomeWide).

The molecular structure of FKBP6 includes a highly conserved triad (AYG and its variants) as part of a long loop linking the C-terminus β-strand with the rest of the molecule, as revealed by X-ray crystallography (Galat2019Compression). This structural feature suggests the potential for forming dimers through disulfide bonding, facilitated by a conserved cysteine residue (Galat2019Compression). The protein is noted to be very hydrophobic, which may influence its interactions and stability (Galat2019Compression).

FKBP6 is expressed predominantly in the testis and is involved in meiotic chromosome synapsis, indicating its role in reproductive biology (Miyamato2006Is). The gene is located on chromosome 7q11.23 and spans from exon 1 to exon 8 (Miyamato2006Is).

## Function
The FKBP6 gene encodes a protein that is part of the immunophilins FKBP family, which is involved in various cellular processes, including protein folding and trafficking. Although FKBP6 is considered inactive as a prolyl isomerase, it plays a crucial role in spermatogenesis and chromosomal pairing during meiosis. In healthy human cells, FKBP6 is primarily active in the nucleus and is associated with the synaptonemal complex, contributing to genomic stability and fertility (Raudsepp2012GenomeWide; Miyamato2006Is).

The FKBP6 protein features an N-terminal prolyl isomerase/FK506-binding domain and a C-terminal domain with three tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs. These domains facilitate its role as a co-chaperone, forming complexes with proteins such as Hsp72, Hsp90, and GAPDH, which are involved in membrane fusion processes, including the acrosome reaction (Raudsepp2012GenomeWide). FKBP6 is also implicated in the regulation of calcium channel interactions, which may influence acrosome exocytosis (Raudsepp2012GenomeWide).

In addition to its role in meiosis, FKBP6 is involved in the assembly of multiprotein complexes associated with clathrin-coated vesicles, such as acrosomes or synaptic vesicles, indicating its broader involvement in cellular transport and communication (Raudsepp2012GenomeWide).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FKBP6 gene have been associated with male infertility, particularly azoospermia, which is characterized by a lack of sperm in semen. In mice, FKBP6 knockout males are sterile due to meiotic arrest, leading to azoospermia, while females remain reproductively normal (Miyamato2006Is). In humans, FKBP6 mutations do not directly cause azoospermia but may modify susceptibility to idiopathic spermatogenic impairment (Raudsepp2012GenomeWide). A study identified a novel polymorphism, 245C>G (Y60X), in exon 3 of FKBP6 in patients with azoospermia, although its frequency did not significantly differ from controls, suggesting it may not be a common cause (Miyamato2006Is).

In stallions, FKBP6 has been implicated as a susceptibility locus for impaired acrosome reaction (IAR), a condition affecting male fertility. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in FKBP6 are strongly associated with IAR, suggesting that mutations or alterations in FKBP6 may contribute to this condition (Raudsepp2012GenomeWide). The gene's expression is predominantly in the testis, indicating its role in spermatogenesis and possibly sperm functions (Raudsepp2012GenomeWide). Despite these findings, the exact role of FKBP6 in sperm functions and its molecular link to IAR remains inadequately understood (Raudsepp2012GenomeWide).

## Interactions
FKBP6 is involved in several protein interactions, particularly in the context of meiosis and fertility. It is a component of the synaptonemal complex, a structure essential for homologous chromosome pairing during meiosis. In mice, FKBP6 localizes to meiotic chromosome cores and regions of homologous chromosome synapsis, indicating its role in maintaining synapsis between homologous pairs (Miyamato2006Is). The protein contains a prolyl isomerase/FK506-binding domain and tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which are known to mediate protein-protein interactions (Miyamato2006Is).

FKBP6 is also associated with the piRNA pathway, which is crucial for silencing transposable elements in germ cells. This interaction suggests a role in genomic integrity maintenance, although specific protein partners in this pathway are not detailed in the provided context (GharteyKwansah2018Comparative). Despite its involvement in these pathways, the context does not provide detailed information on direct physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids. The potential for interactions with other proteins is suggested by the presence of TPR domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, but specific partners are not identified (GharteyKwansah2018Comparative).
