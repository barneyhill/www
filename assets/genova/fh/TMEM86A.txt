# TMEM86A

## Overview
TMEM86A is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 86A, which is categorized as a lysoplasmalogenase involved in lipid metabolism. This protein is integral to the regulation of plasmalogen homeostasis, particularly within adipocytes, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining the lipid composition of cellular membranes. TMEM86A is characterized by its structure, which includes eight transmembrane regions, and is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum. The protein's enzymatic activity is essential for controlling lysolipid levels, thereby influencing mitochondrial function and energy metabolism. TMEM86A's involvement in protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathways further underscores its significance in metabolic processes, impacting energy expenditure and thermogenesis (Cho2022Adipocyte).

## Structure
The TMEM86A protein is predicted to have a structure with eight transmembrane regions, as suggested by a high-confidence AlphaFold computational model (Cho2022Adipocyte). This model indicates the presence of potential catalytic histidine and aspartate residues within the transmembrane region, with residues D82 and D190 being absolutely conserved and crucial for catalytic activity. Mutations at these sites, such as D82A or D190A, significantly reduce lysoplasmalogenase activity in HEK293T cells (Cho2022Adipocyte).

TMEM86A is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, as evidenced by its colocalization with ER Tracker staining in C3H10T1/2 cells (Cho2022Adipocyte). The protein is part of the YhhN family, which includes lysoplasmalogenases conserved across bacterial and mammalian species (Cho2022Adipocyte). While specific details about the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not provided, the presence of transmembrane regions suggests a complex folding pattern typical of membrane proteins. The study does not mention any post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms for TMEM86A.

## Function
TMEM86A is a gene that encodes a protein involved in lipid metabolism, particularly in the regulation of plasmalogen homeostasis in adipocytes. TMEM86A functions as a lysoplasmalogenase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes lysoplasmalogens, thereby controlling lysolipid levels within cells (Cho2022Adipocyte). This activity is crucial for maintaining the lipid composition of adipocyte membranes and is linked to energy metabolism and mitochondrial function (Cho2022Adipocyte).

In healthy cells, TMEM86A is active in adipose tissue, where it influences mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and energy expenditure. The protein's activity is associated with the regulation of protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathways, which are important for lipolysis and oxidative metabolism (Cho2022Adipocyte). TMEM86A's role in these processes is evidenced by its impact on the phosphorylation of PKA substrates, such as hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), which are involved in energy metabolism (Cho2022Adipocyte).

TMEM86A's regulation of plasmalogen levels and its involvement in PKA signaling suggest its importance in maintaining cellular energy balance and metabolic health, potentially impacting body weight and thermogenesis (Cho2022Adipocyte).

## Clinical Significance
TMEM86A has been implicated in several metabolic and cancer-related conditions due to its role in lipid metabolism and energy regulation. In the context of obesity and metabolic disorders, TMEM86A expression is significantly upregulated in white adipose tissue of mice and humans exposed to high-fat diets, suggesting its involvement in the pathological response to overnutrition (Cho2022Adipocyte). Adipocyte-specific knockout of TMEM86A enhances mitochondrial metabolism and energy expenditure, leading to reduced body weight gain and improved metabolic health, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target for obesity-related conditions (Cho2022Adipocyte).

In cancer research, TMEM86A has been identified as a potential biomarker for breast cancer. It is included in a list of transmembrane genes significant for breast cancer classification, suggesting its potential utility in early diagnosis (MayoralPeña2023Identification). Additionally, TMEM86A is highlighted as a candidate tumor surface antigen in HER2 amplified breast cancer and shows differential expression in various cancer types, including liver, colon, and gastric cancers (MaresQuiñones2024Identification). These findings underscore the gene's relevance in both metabolic and oncological contexts, warranting further investigation into its clinical applications.
