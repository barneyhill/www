# ZNHIT3

## Overview
ZNHIT3 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger HIT-type containing 3 protein, which is integral to various cellular processes, particularly in ribosome biogenesis and transcription regulation. The protein is characterized by a zinc finger HIT domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions essential for its function in chromatin remodeling and the assembly of small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein complexes (snoRNPs) (Anttonen2017ZNHIT3; Rahman2024NewZNHIT3Variants). ZNHIT3 is involved in the chemical modification and processing of ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), playing a critical role in the 2'-O-methylation of rRNA, a modification necessary for efficient ribosome function and protein synthesis (Rahman2024NewZNHIT3Variants). The protein's interactions with other components, such as NUFIP1, underscore its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper ribosome assembly (Quinternet2016Structural). Mutations in the ZNHIT3 gene have been linked to PEHO syndrome, a severe neurodevelopmental disorder, highlighting the clinical significance of this gene and its encoded protein (Anttonen2017ZNHIT3).

## Structure
The ZNHIT3 protein is encoded by the ZNHIT3 gene and is characterized by a zinc finger HIT domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions and is crucial for its function in transcription regulation and chromatin remodeling (Anttonen2017ZNHIT3). The primary structure of ZNHIT3 consists of 155 amino acids, with a cysteine-rich histidine triad motif-type zinc finger (zf-HIT) domain located at the N-terminal region, spanning amino acids 11-42 (Anttonen2017ZNHIT3). This domain is essential for the protein's role in nuclear functions and is involved in the assembly of box C/D small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein complexes (snoRNPs) (Rahman2024NewZNHIT3Variants).

The secondary structure of ZNHIT3 includes five alpha helices (a1 to a5) in its C-terminal region, which are involved in forming a complex with NUFIP1, a protein that plays a role in snoRNP assembly (Quinternet2016Structural). The tertiary structure of ZNHIT3 is described as forming a Pac-Hit fold, similar to the yeast protein Hit1p, indicating a conserved structural organization across species (Quinternet2016Structural). The quaternary structure involves the formation of a tripartite complex with SNU13 and NUFIP1, although ZNHIT3 and SNU13 do not directly interact, suggesting they are independent modules within the complex (Quinternet2016Structural).

## Function
The ZNHIT3 gene encodes a zinc finger HIT-type containing protein that plays a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis and cellular translation processes. In healthy human cells, ZNHIT3 is involved in the assembly of small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins (snoRNPs), which are essential for the chemical modification and processing of ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) (Rahman2024NewZNHIT3Variants). This protein interacts with other proteins, such as NUFIP1, to facilitate the formation of box C/D snoRNP complexes, which are necessary for the 2'-O-methylation of rRNA, a modification critical for ribosome function and protein synthesis (Rahman2024NewZNHIT3Variants).

ZNHIT3 is also implicated in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling, suggesting a role in pre-ribosomal RNA processing and transcription regulation (Anttonen2017ZNHIT3). The protein is active in both the cytosol and nucleus, with a significant presence in the nucleus where it participates in nuclear processes (Anttonen2017ZNHIT3). ZNHIT3's function is vital for maintaining the steady-state levels of snoRNAs and ensuring proper ribosome assembly, which supports efficient protein synthesis and cellular homeostasis (Rahman2024NewZNHIT3Variants). Disruption in ZNHIT3 function can lead to impaired rRNA processing and decreased cellular translation, contributing to various human diseases (Rahman2024NewZNHIT3Variants).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZNHIT3 gene are associated with PEHO syndrome, a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by cerebellar atrophy, edema, hypsarrhythmia, optic atrophy, and psychomotor development arrest. The p.Ser31Leu mutation is a Finnish founder pathogenic variant, leading to a loss-of-function mechanism due to impaired protein folding and increased degradation (Anttonen2017ZNHIT3). This mutation results in cerebellar granule neuron loss, contributing to the syndrome's neuropathological features (Anttonen2017ZNHIT3).

Genetic heterogeneity in PEHO syndrome is suggested by the identification of compound heterozygous variants, such as c.41G>T (p.C14F) in an Estonian case, indicating that different mutations in ZNHIT3 can lead to similar clinical manifestations (Sabaie2020Clinical). Novel ZNHIT3 variants, such as C14R and ∆251-254, have been linked to prenatal PEHO syndrome with isolated hydrops, affecting snoRNP assembly and leading to impaired ribosome biogenesis and translation (Rahman2024NewZNHIT3Variants). These variants cause site-specific hypo 2'-O-methylation of rRNA and reduce the levels of specific box C/D snoRNAs, further contributing to the disease pathology (Rahman2024NewZNHIT3Variants).

## Interactions
ZNHIT3 is involved in the assembly of box C/D small nucleolar RNPs (snoRNPs), which are essential for post-transcriptional modifications of RNAs. It interacts with NUFIP1, a key component in the snoRNP assembly pathway, and this interaction is crucial for maintaining the steady-state levels of NUFIP1 (Quinternet2016Structural; Rothé2014Protein). ZNHIT3 forms a tripartite complex with SNU13 and NUFIP1, although ZNHIT3 and SNU13 do not directly interact strongly within this complex. Instead, they act as independent modules bound to the NUFIP1 platform, separated by a flexible linker (Quinternet2016Structural).

The interaction between ZNHIT3 and NUFIP1 is mediated by their 3D structures, with the C-terminal part of NUFIP1 involved in binding ZNHIT3. This interaction is characterized by hydrophobic contacts and a salt bridge between specific residues, contributing to the stability of the complex (Quinternet2016Structural). Despite the structural conservation of these interactions across species, the mammalian complex is less stable than its yeast counterpart (Quinternet2016Structural). ZNHIT3 also plays a role in the release of the snoRNP complex upon the arrival of the proper snoRNA and the binding of NOP58, a process independent of NUFIP1 (Quinternet2016Structural).
