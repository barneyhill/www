# RARRES1

## Overview
RARRES1 (retinoic acid receptor responder 1) is a gene that encodes a tumor suppressor protein involved in various cellular processes, including lipid metabolism, mitochondrial function, and immune response modulation. The protein encoded by RARRES1 is integral to the regulation of fatty acid metabolism and cellular differentiation, particularly in epithelial and B cells, where it influences lipid synthesis, autophagy, and cell cycle progression. RARRES1 interacts with several proteins, such as TMEM192, VCP, ICAM1, and SPINK2, affecting processes like autophagy, immune cell behavior, and sensitivity to cancer therapies. Its expression is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including cancers and kidney disorders, where its dysregulation can lead to altered cell proliferation, apoptosis, and drug resistance (Guo2024RARRES1; Maimouni2018Tumor; Geng2022Interaction).

## Structure


## Function
RARRES1 (retinoic acid receptor responder 1) is a gene that plays a significant role in regulating fatty acid metabolism and cellular differentiation in healthy human cells. It is involved in the modulation of lipid metabolism by influencing lipogenesis and lipid droplet accumulation. In epithelial cells, RARRES1 regulates the balance between lipid synthesis and degradation, particularly under conditions of nutrient deprivation, where its expression increases to modulate lipid accumulation and autophagy (Maimouni2018Tumor).

RARRES1 also affects mitochondrial metabolism by regulating the switch from aerobic glycolysis to glucose-dependent de novo lipogenesis, which is crucial for maintaining cellular energy balance and sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli (Maimouni2018Tumor). It interacts with proteins such as TMEM192 and VCP, influencing autophagy and cell cycle regulation, which are important for maintaining tissue homeostasis and reducing invasiveness in healthy cells (Huebner2017Hypermethylation).

In the context of B cell function, RARRES1 is essential for the differentiation of B cells into germinal center B cells and plasma cells, which are necessary for effective antibody production. Its loss results in impaired cell cycle progression and decreased antibody production, highlighting its role in promoting B cell differentiation and survival (Patel2022Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RARRES1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers and kidney diseases. In breast cancer, RARRES1 acts as a tumor suppressor, and its downregulation is associated with increased invasiveness and reduced apoptosis. This downregulation is often due to promoter methylation and loss of CTCF binding, which silences the gene and may facilitate cancer progression (Peng2012Epigenetic). In skin cutaneous melanoma, RARRES1 is significantly downregulated, correlating with poor prognosis and reduced immune cell infiltration. Its expression is affected by promoter hypermethylation and genomic deletions, impacting tumor progression and patient survival (Liu2024RARRES1).

In kidney diseases, particularly diabetic kidney disease and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, RARRES1 expression is upregulated and linked to podocyte apoptosis. This upregulation is associated with disease progression and poor kidney function, as RARRES1 interacts with RIOK1 to induce apoptosis (Chen2020Soluble). In hepatocellular carcinoma, RARRES1 downregulation decreases sensitivity to the drug lenvatinib, suggesting its role in drug resistance and cancer progression (Guo2024RARRES1). These findings highlight the clinical significance of RARRES1 expression alterations in various diseases.

## Interactions
RARRES1, a tumor suppressor protein, participates in several significant interactions with other proteins, influencing various cellular processes. In kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), RARRES1 interacts with ICAM1, a protein associated with macrophage infiltration. This interaction enhances the binding of ICAM1 to Mac-1 on macrophages, promoting their migration and polarization towards an M1 phenotype, which is linked to tumor suppression (Geng2022Interaction). The interaction between RARRES1 and ICAM1 is crucial for modulating immune responses in KIRC, as it influences macrophage behavior and potentially offers a therapeutic target for cancer treatment (Geng2022Interaction).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), RARRES1 interacts with SPINK2, a serine protease inhibitor. This interaction is significant in enhancing the sensitivity of HCC cells to lenvatinib, a multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor used in cancer treatment. The RARRES1-SPINK2 interaction is associated with reduced cell proliferation and migration, contributing to the inhibition of tumor progression (Guo2024RARRES1). These interactions highlight RARRES1's role in modulating cellular responses and its potential as a therapeutic target in various cancers.
