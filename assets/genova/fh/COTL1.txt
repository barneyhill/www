# COTL1

## Overview
COTL1 is a gene that encodes the coactosin-like F-actin binding protein 1, a crucial component in the regulation of actin dynamics within human cells. This protein is categorized as an actin-binding protein due to its role in interacting with filamentous actin (F-actin) and influencing the stability and organization of actin filaments. The coactosin-like protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the formation of lamellipodia, which are essential for cell migration and motility, and the regulation of immune responses through T cell activation. Additionally, COTL1 plays a significant role in maintaining epithelial barrier integrity by regulating tight and adherens junctions. The protein's interactions with other molecules, such as 5-lipoxygenase, further underscore its importance in cellular dynamics and its potential implications in disease pathogenesis (Kim2014CoactosinLike; Lechuga2024Coactosinlike; PROVOST2001Coactosinlike).

## Structure
COTL1, or coactosin-like F-actin binding protein 1, is a human protein that plays a significant role in actin dynamics. The primary structure of COTL1 consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its function. The protein contains an actin-depolymerizing factor homology (ADF-H) domain, which is crucial for its ability to bind F-actin (Hou2021Coactosin; Kim2014CoactosinLike). This domain is shared among proteins that regulate actin filament dynamics, allowing COTL1 to interact with F-actin and influence its stability and organization.

The secondary structure of COTL1 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its overall stability and functional conformation. The tertiary structure of COTL1 forms a compact, globular shape, facilitating its interaction with actin filaments. COTL1 functions as a monomer and does not exhibit a quaternary structure (Hou2021Coactosin).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur in COTL1, potentially affecting its activity and interactions with other proteins (Hou2021Coactosin). These modifications can play a role in regulating the protein's function in cellular processes, such as T cell activation and axon outgrowth.

## Function
Coactosin-like protein 1 (COTL1) is a crucial regulator of actin dynamics in human cells, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. COTL1 binds to filamentous actin (F-actin) and is involved in the organization and stabilization of actin filaments, which is essential for maintaining cell structure and function (PROVOST2001Coactosinlike). It is particularly important in the formation of lamellipodia, cellular protrusions that are critical for cell migration and motility. COTL1 antagonizes cofilin, a protein that severs and depolymerizes F-actin, thereby protecting F-actin from disassembly and promoting lamellipodial protrusion (Kim2014CoactosinLike).

In the immune system, COTL1 is essential for T cell activation and the formation of the immune synapse, where it facilitates F-actin accumulation and lamellipodial extension (Kim2014CoactosinLike). COTL1 is also involved in maintaining the integrity of epithelial barriers, where it regulates the structure and repair of tight junctions and adherens junctions in intestinal epithelial cells. This function is crucial for controlling paracellular permeability and ensuring proper epithelial barrier function (Lechuga2024Coactosinlike). COTL1's role in these processes highlights its importance in cellular dynamics and tissue integrity.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the COTL1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly autoimmune disorders and various cancers. In autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), specific polymorphisms in the COTL1 gene, such as c.-1124G＞T and c.484G＞A, are associated with increased susceptibility. These polymorphisms may influence gene expression levels and are linked to anti-CCP antibody levels in RA patients, suggesting a role in disease pathogenesis (Jin2009Polymorphisms).

In cancer, COTL1 is upregulated in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and glioblastoma (GBM), where it is associated with poor prognosis and aggressive tumor behavior. In SCLC, COTL1 is significantly more expressed compared to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), indicating its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Jeong2011Proteomic). In GBM, high COTL1 expression correlates with tumor recurrence and reduced survival rates, highlighting its role in tumor growth and progression (p&gt; Shao2020&lt; CoactosinLike).

In breast cancer, the downregulation of miR-30c-5p leads to increased COTL1 expression, promoting cell migration and metastasis, suggesting that targeting the miR-30c-5p/COTL1 pathway could be a therapeutic strategy (Pei2020Downregulation).

## Interactions
COTL1, also known as coactosin-like protein, is involved in several protein interactions, particularly with 5-lipoxygenase (5LO) and filamentous actin (F-actin). COTL1 directly binds to 5LO, forming a heterodimeric complex in a 1:1 molar stoichiometry. This interaction is independent of calcium ions (Ca2+) and is crucially mediated by lysine 131 of COTL1 (Provost20015Lipoxygenase). The binding of COTL1 to 5LO does not affect the enzyme's activity or its membrane association, which is Ca2+-dependent (Provost20015Lipoxygenase).

COTL1 also interacts with F-actin, binding in a 1:2 stoichiometry, meaning one COTL1 molecule binds to two actin subunits. This interaction is pH-insensitive and Ca2+-independent (PROVOST2001Coactosinlike). However, COTL1 does not form a stable complex with globular actin (G-actin) (PROVOST2001Coactosinlike). The binding sites on COTL1 for 5LO and F-actin are distinct, and no ternary complex involving F-actin, COTL1, and 5LO has been observed. Instead, 5LO competes with F-actin for COTL1 binding, suggesting that the interactions between 5LO-COTL1 and COTL1-F-actin are mutually exclusive (Provost20015Lipoxygenase).
