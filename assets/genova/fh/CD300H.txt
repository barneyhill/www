# CD300H

## Overview
CD300H is a gene that encodes a member of the CD300 family of proteins, which are known to be involved in immune cell signaling. The CD300H protein is categorized as a receptor and is primarily expressed on the surface of certain immune cells, where it plays a role in modulating immune responses. This gene is of particular interest due to its potential involvement in immune regulation and its implications in various immune-related disorders. The CD300H protein interacts with other molecules on the cell surface to influence signaling pathways that are critical for immune cell activation and function. Understanding the precise mechanisms by which CD300H operates could provide insights into therapeutic targets for diseases characterized by immune dysregulation.
