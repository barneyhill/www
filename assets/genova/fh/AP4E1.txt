# AP4E1

## Overview
The AP4E1 gene encodes the epsilon 1 subunit of the adaptor protein complex 4 (AP-4), which is integral to the intracellular trafficking system. The AP-4 complex, comprising four subunits (ε, β4, µ4, and σ4), is primarily involved in the sorting and transport of transmembrane proteins from the trans-Golgi network to the cell periphery, a process essential for cellular homeostasis and autophagy (Saffari2023HighContent; Davies2017AP4). The protein encoded by AP4E1, known as adaptor related protein complex 4 subunit epsilon 1, plays a critical role in the spatial regulation of autophagy, particularly in neurons, by facilitating the transport of ATG9A-positive vesicles necessary for autophagosome formation (Davies2017AP4). Mutations in the AP4E1 gene have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, including Spastic Paraplegia 51, underscoring its importance in neurological health and function (Manoochehri2022Spastic).

## Function
The AP4E1 gene encodes a subunit of the adaptor protein complex 4 (AP-4), which is crucial for intracellular protein trafficking. In healthy human cells, AP-4 is involved in the sorting and transport of transmembrane cargo proteins from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the cell periphery, a process essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper autophagy (Saffari2023HighContent; Davies2017AP4). The AP-4 complex consists of four subunits: ε (AP4E1), β4, µ4, and σ4, and is responsible for the peripheral delivery of proteins such as ATG9A, which is critical for autophagosome biogenesis (Kong2013A; Davies2017AP4).

AP4E1, as part of the AP-4 complex, plays a significant role in the spatial control of autophagy by facilitating the transport of ATG9A-positive vesicles to the cell periphery, where they contribute to autophagosome formation (Davies2017AP4). This process is particularly important in neurons, where it supports the transport of ATG9A to distal axons, crucial for neuronal function and homeostasis (Davies2017AP4). The AP-4 complex's role in protein trafficking is vital for the proper functioning of the endosomal-lysosomal system, impacting cellular and organismal health (Davies2017AP4).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AP4E1 gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders, most notably Spastic Paraplegia 51 (SPG51), a form of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). SPG51 is characterized by severe intellectual disability, absent speech, microcephaly, seizures, and movement disorders. These symptoms result from autosomal recessive mutations in the AP4E1 gene, which lead to a loss of function of the AP-4 protein complex, crucial for protein sorting and trafficking within cells (Manoochehri2022Spastic; Winkler2021A).

The AP4E1 gene is also linked to persistent stuttering through autosomal dominant mutations. While these mutations do not cause the severe symptoms seen in homozygous individuals, they are more frequent in individuals with stuttering compared to control groups. This suggests a role for AP4E1 in speech-related neurological processes (Raza2015Association).

Additionally, a novel homozygous nonsense mutation in AP4E1 has been associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia and mycobacterial disease, highlighting the gene's role in maintaining the stability of the AP-4 complex and its potential involvement in immunological health (Kong2013A).

## Interactions
The AP4E1 gene encodes the ε subunit of the adaptor protein complex 4 (AP-4), which is involved in intracellular trafficking. AP4E1 interacts with other subunits of the AP-4 complex, including AP4B1, AP4M1, and AP4S1, to form a functional complex essential for protein sorting at the trans-Golgi network (Kong2013A; Davies2018AP4). 

AP4E1 has been shown to interact with the transmembrane protein ATG9A, which is a cargo of the AP-4 complex. This interaction is crucial for the proper trafficking of ATG9A, and AP-4 deficiency leads to the accumulation of ATG9A at the trans-Golgi network, affecting autophagosome formation (Ivankovic2017AP4; Davies2018AP4). 

The AP-4 complex also interacts with RUSC2, an accessory protein that binds to the appendage domains of AP-4 subunits, particularly the ε ear domain of AP4E1. This interaction is important for the spatial control of autophagy and the peripheral delivery of ATG9A (Davies2018AP4). 

Additionally, AP4E1 is associated with the NAGPA protein, which interacts with the μ subunits of AP-4. This interaction is implicated in the intracellular trafficking processes that may contribute to conditions such as persistent stuttering (Raza2015Association).
