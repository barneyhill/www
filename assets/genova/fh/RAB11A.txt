# RAB11A

## Overview
RAB11A is a gene that encodes a small GTPase protein, which is a member of the RAS oncogene family. The RAB11A protein plays a pivotal role in intracellular vesicle trafficking, particularly in the recycling of endosomes to the plasma membrane. This protein is characterized by its ability to bind and hydrolyze GTP, which is essential for its function in membrane trafficking and cellular homeostasis. Structurally, RAB11A is composed of 218 amino acids and features a GTP-binding domain that undergoes conformational changes to facilitate interactions with various binding partners, including Rab11 family-interacting proteins (FIPs) (Jagoe2006Purification; Kumar2018Allosteric). The protein's involvement in processes such as cytokinesis, cell migration, and primary ciliogenesis underscores its importance in maintaining cellular function and integrity (Knödler2010Coordination; Welz2014Orchestration). Additionally, RAB11A's role in the endosome-lysosomal pathway and its interactions with proteins like FLCN and Myo5b highlight its significance in cellular signaling and trafficking pathways (Zhao2018FLCN; Zulkefli2019A).

## Structure
RAB11A is a small GTPase involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking, belonging to the RAS oncogene family. The primary structure of RAB11A consists of 218 amino acids, forming a protein with a molecular weight of approximately 24.4 kDa (Jagoe2006Purification). The secondary structure includes six β-strands and five α-helices, which are characteristic of Rab GTPases (Shiba2006Structural). 

The tertiary structure of RAB11A is a compact, globular form that features a GTP-binding domain. This domain is crucial for its function in membrane trafficking, as it undergoes conformational changes upon GTP binding and hydrolysis (Kumar2018Allosteric). The switch 1 and switch 2 regions are particularly important for its interactions with various binding partners, including Rab11 family-interacting proteins (FIPs) (Kumar2018Allosteric).

RAB11A can form homodimers, representing its quaternary structure. This dimerization is essential for its interaction with FIPs, such as FIP3, which forms a parallel coiled-coil homodimer to interact with two Rab11 molecules (Shiba2006Structural). Post-translational modifications, such as prenylation, aid in membrane attachment, enhancing its role in vesicle trafficking (Jagoe2006Purification).

## Function
RAB11A is a small GTPase protein that plays a critical role in intracellular membrane trafficking, particularly in the recycling of endosomes. It is involved in the transport of vesicles from endosomes to the plasma membrane, which is essential for maintaining cell surface receptor levels and facilitating cellular communication and homeostasis (Welz2014Orchestration). RAB11A is active in recycling endosomes and is crucial for processes such as cytokinesis and cell migration (Welz2014Orchestration).

In primary ciliogenesis, RAB11A stimulates the guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity of Rabin8, enhancing the release of GDP from Rab8, a protein involved in cilia formation. This interaction is vital for normal cilia length and proper ciliogenesis, as RAB11A localizes at the base of primary cilia (Knödler2010Coordination).

RAB11A also plays a significant role in the homeostasis of the endosome-lysosomal pathway, affecting the maturation and function of endosomes and lysosomes. It maintains the size, distribution, and acidity of these organelles, which is crucial for protein trafficking and degradation (Zulkefli2019A).

In endothelial cells, RAB11A is essential for recycling vascular endothelial-cadherin to the plasma membrane, maintaining endothelial barrier integrity and regulating vascular permeability (Yan2016Rab11a).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RAB11A gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), Rab11A plays a crucial role in the recycling of amyloid species. A decrease in Rab11A within microglia-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) upon beta-amyloid treatment has been observed, which may hinder the clearance of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and contribute to increased amyloid burden and neuronal death (Mignogna2023Rab11A). This suggests that Rab11A depletion in EVs could exacerbate AD pathology by disrupting the balance of Aβ recycling and secretion (Mignogna2023Rab11A).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), Rab11A is overexpressed and acts as an oncoprotein. Its overexpression is associated with poor clinical prognosis and promotes tumor progression by enhancing cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and anti-apoptosis. Rab11A activates the PI3K/AKT pathway, leading to the upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), which is crucial for tumor growth and metastasis (Zhang2020Rab11a). These findings suggest that Rab11A could be a potential target for therapeutic intervention in HCC (Zhang2020Rab11a).

## Interactions
RAB11A is involved in various protein interactions that play crucial roles in intracellular trafficking and signaling pathways. It interacts with the epithelial calcium channels TRPV5 and TRPV6, facilitating their targeting to the plasma membrane. This interaction is mediated by a specific binding site on TRPV5, located between amino acids 595 and 601, and is essential for the proper trafficking and function of these channels in calcium transport (van2006Direct).

RAB11A also interacts with FLCN (Folliculin) through FLCN's DENN domain, which is involved in the Rab11A-mediated recycling transport pathway. This interaction influences the mTORC1 signaling pathway by modulating the distribution of PAT1 on the lysosome and plasma membrane (Zhao2018FLCN).

In the context of recycling endosomes, RAB11A interacts with Myo5b and FIP2. RAB11A binds to the globular tail domain of Myo5b, activating its motor function, while FIP2 acts as a bridge between Myo5b and membrane-bound RAB11A, facilitating vesicle association (Ji2019Regulation).

RAB11A also plays a role in the trafficking of transferrin receptor and E-cadherin by interacting with reggies/flotillins and SNX4 at the tubulovesicular recycling compartment, which is crucial for cell migration and the formation of adherens junctions (Solis2013Reggiesflotillins).
