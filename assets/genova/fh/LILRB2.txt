# LILRB2

## Overview
LILRB2, or leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B2, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in immune regulation. The protein, also referred to as LILRB2, is an inhibitory receptor expressed on various immune cells, including monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils. It plays a crucial role in maintaining immune homeostasis by interacting with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, including both classical and non-classical forms such as HLA-G, to transmit inhibitory signals that regulate immune cell activity (Umiker2023Inhibition; brown2004lilr). The structural configuration of LILRB2, characterized by its four extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, allows it to interact with a broad range of MHC class I molecules, influencing various immune responses and contributing to its involvement in disease pathology, including cancer, HIV-1 infection, and Alzheimer's disease (Hirayasu2015Functional; Bashirova2014LILRB2; Wang2019Structures).

## Structure
LILRB2 is a protein composed of four extracellular immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domains, designated as D1, D2, D3, and D4. The D1D2 domains are primarily responsible for binding to human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) molecules, while the D3D4 domains serve as a structural scaffold (Wang2019Structures). The D3D4 domains are arranged at an acute angle of approximately 60°, forming a bent structure similar to natural killer inhibitory receptors (Nam2013Crystal). The D3 domain of LILRB2 features two anti-parallel β-sheets, one with three β-strands and the other with four, while the D4 domain has two β-sheets, each with four β-strands (Nam2013Crystal).

The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which may influence its function and interactions. LILRB2 can form dimers, contributing to its quaternary structure (brown2004lilr). The interdomain angles, particularly between D1D2 and D3D4, are crucial for its interaction with ligands, with the D2D3 hinge region having an angle of about 50° (Wang2019Structures). The structural configuration of LILRB2 allows it to interact with a broad range of MHC class I molecules, including both normal and free heavy chains (brown2004lilr).

## Function
LILRB2, also known as leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B2, is an inhibitory receptor expressed on various immune cells, including monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils. It primarily interacts with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, including both classical and non-classical forms such as HLA-G, to modulate immune responses (Umiker2023Inhibition; brown2004lilr). This interaction is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis by transmitting inhibitory signals that regulate immune cell activity, preventing overactivation and potential autoimmune reactions (brown2004lilr).

In healthy human cells, LILRB2 plays a significant role in the regulation of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) like monocytes and dendritic cells. It inhibits the expression of costimulatory proteins B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86) on APCs, which affects CD4+ T-cell proliferation and may contribute to T-cell anergy (brown2004lilr). LILRB2 is also involved in the modulation of neutrophil activity, where its crosslinking with HLA-G can suppress degranulation and phagocytosis, indicating its role in regulating immune responses during the activation phases of neutrophils (Lewis2020Leukocyte). The receptor's expression is upregulated by cytokines like IL-10, which is associated with immune regulation (brown2004lilr).

## Clinical Significance
LILRB2 is implicated in various diseases due to its role in immune regulation. In cancer, LILRB2 is highly expressed on immunosuppressive macrophages within the tumor microenvironment, contributing to immune evasion by tumors. The expression of LILRB2 on CD163+ CD11b+ macrophages is associated with several cancer types, including head and neck, melanoma, colorectal, lung, breast, and ovarian cancers. This expression correlates with an immunosuppressive phenotype, which can hinder T-cell activation and promote tumor progression (Umiker2023Inhibition).

In the context of HIV-1 infection, LILRB2 interacts with HLA class I molecules, influencing the immune response. Stronger binding of LILRB2 to certain HLA-B alleles is associated with higher viral loads, suggesting that these interactions may impair dendritic cell function and contribute to disease progression (Bashirova2014LILRB2).

LILRB2 also plays a role in Alzheimer's disease, as it acts as a receptor for oligomeric forms of β-amyloid, which are implicated in the disease's pathology (Hirayasu2015Functional). These interactions highlight the clinical significance of LILRB2 in various diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
LILRB2, a member of the leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor family, is involved in various interactions that modulate immune responses. It binds to classical and nonclassical HLA class I molecules, competing with CD8 for HLA-I binding, which can influence CD8+ T cell responses (Chen2018Blocking). LILRB2 also interacts with SHP-1 and SHP-2 phosphatases, which are involved in signaling pathways that regulate immune cell functions (Chen2018Blocking).

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, LILRB2 interacts with TREM2 in human microglia. Both proteins bind to shared ligands such as oligomeric amyloid-beta (oAβ) and phosphatidylserine (PS). This co-ligation inhibits TREM2 signaling, which is crucial for microglial activity (Zhao2022LILRB2mediated). The interaction between LILRB2 and these ligands is mediated by its D1 and D2 domains, which are essential for effective ligand binding (Zhao2022LILRB2mediated).

LILRB2's interactions extend to its role in cancer, where it acts as a negative regulator in tumor-associated myeloid cells. Blocking LILRB2 can enhance inflammatory responses and alter macrophage maturation, promoting an antitumor immune response (Chen2018Blocking). These interactions highlight LILRB2's significant role in both immune regulation and disease pathology.
