# NECTIN3

## Overview
NECTIN3 is a gene that encodes the protein nectin cell adhesion molecule 3, which is a member of the nectin family of immunoglobulin-like cell adhesion molecules. This protein plays a pivotal role in mediating cell-cell adhesion, particularly in the formation and maintenance of adherens junctions in epithelial tissues. Nectin-3 is characterized by its ability to engage in both homophilic and heterophilic interactions, with a preference for heterophilic interactions with other nectins such as nectin-1 and nectin-2. These interactions are crucial for the structural organization of cell junctions and are independent of calcium ions. Nectin-3 is also involved in various physiological processes, including spermatogenesis and ocular development, by facilitating specific cell-cell adhesions. Additionally, alterations in NECTIN3 expression have been linked to various cancers, where it can serve as a prognostic biomarker, highlighting its clinical significance (SatohHorikawa2000Nectin3; Mandai2015Nectins; Xu2019Nectin3).

## Structure
NECTIN3 encodes a protein that is part of the immunoglobulin-like cell adhesion molecules, specifically involved in forming adherens junctions. The primary structure of nectin-3 includes three splicing variants: nectin-3a, nectin-3b, and nectin-3g. Nectin-3a is the largest variant, consisting of 549 amino acids with a molecular weight of 60,580 Da, while nectin-3b and nectin-3g have 510 and 438 amino acids, respectively (SatohHorikawa2000Nectin3).

The secondary structure of nectin-3 features three extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane segment, and a cytoplasmic tail. The cytoplasmic region contains a C-terminal conserved motif that interacts with the PDZ domain of afadin, linking nectin-3 to the actin cytoskeleton (SatohHorikawa2000Nectin3; Fujiwara2015Crystal).

In terms of quaternary structure, nectin-3 can form cis-homo-dimers and trans-heterophilic interactions with nectin-1 and nectin-2, but it does not form cis-hetero-dimers with them. The affinity for trans-heterophilic interactions is higher than for trans-homophilic interactions (SatohHorikawa2000Nectin3).

Post-translational modifications include potential N-linked glycosylation at specific sites within the protein (SatohHorikawa2000Nectin3). These structural features enable nectin-3 to participate in both homophilic and heterophilic cell-cell adhesion activities.

## Function
NECTIN3, a member of the nectin family of immunoglobulin-like cell adhesion molecules, plays a crucial role in mediating cell-cell adhesion in healthy human cells. It is involved in both homophilic and heterophilic interactions, with a preference for heterophilic interactions, particularly with nectin-1 and nectin-2 (SatohHorikawa2000Nectin3). These interactions are calcium-independent and contribute to the formation and maintenance of adherens junctions (AJs) in epithelial cells (Miyoshi2007Nectin).

NECTIN3 is localized at cadherin-based AJs and interacts with afadin, an actin filament-binding protein, which connects it to the actin cytoskeleton. This interaction is essential for the structural organization of AJs and tight junctions in polarized epithelia (SatohHorikawa2000Nectin3; Mandai2015Nectins). NECTIN3 also plays a role in recruiting cadherin-catenin complexes to nectin-based adhesion sites, facilitating the cross-talk between cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions (Mandai2015Nectins).

In addition to its role in cell adhesion, NECTIN3 is involved in spermatogenesis and ocular development. It is expressed in spermatids and interacts with nectin-2 in Sertoli cells, which is crucial for sperm morphogenesis (Mandai2015Nectins). In ocular development, NECTIN3 is involved in the adhesion between pigment and nonpigment cell layers of the ciliary epithelia, essential for the morphogenesis of the ciliary body (Mandai2015Nectins).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NECTIN3 gene have been implicated in various cancers, affecting prognosis and disease progression. In ovarian cancer, increased expression of nectin-3 is associated with higher malignancy and poorer overall survival, making it a potential prognostic biomarker. This upregulation is linked to increased expression of matrix metallopeptidases MMP2 and MMP9, which facilitate cancer cell invasion and metastasis (Xu2019Nectin3). In breast cancer, reduced expression of nectin-3 correlates with increased tumor aggressiveness and poorer outcomes, suggesting a potential tumor-suppressive role (Martin2013The). Conversely, in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, higher nectin-3 expression is associated with better prognosis, indicating its role as a positive prognostic factor (Izumi2015Nectin).

In colorectal cancer, lower nectin-3 expression is linked to advanced disease stages and poorer survival, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker (Kobecki2023Prognostic). The expression of nectin-3 also varies in lung adenocarcinoma, where it is associated with poor prognosis when expressed in the membranes (Klekowski2023Clinical). These findings underscore the complex role of nectin-3 in cancer, where its expression levels can serve as important indicators of disease progression and patient outcomes.

## Interactions
NECTIN3, a member of the nectin family of immunoglobulin-like cell adhesion molecules, participates in various protein interactions crucial for cell-cell adhesion. It forms both homophilic and heterophilic interactions. NECTIN3 can engage in trans-homo-interactions with itself and trans-hetero-interactions with NECTIN1 and NECTIN2, with a preference for heterophilic interactions due to higher affinity (SatohHorikawa2000Nectin3). NECTIN3 also interacts with CD155, a poliovirus receptor, through trans-heterophilic interactions, which are essential for recruiting NECTIN3 to cell-cell junctions (Mueller2003Recruitment).

In addition to its interactions with other nectins, NECTIN3 binds to afadin, a cytoplasmic protein that links nectins to the actin cytoskeleton. This interaction is mediated by the PDZ domain of afadin and is crucial for the structural organization of adherens junctions (AJs) and tight junctions in polarized epithelia (SatohHorikawa2000Nectin3; Fujiwara2015Crystal). NECTIN3's interaction with afadin is specific to its α variant, which contains a C-terminal motif necessary for PDZ domain binding (SatohHorikawa2000Nectin3).

Furthermore, NECTIN3 interacts with Necl-5, a cell adhesion molecule, in a cell density-dependent manner, influencing cell movement and proliferation (Fujito2005Inhibition). These interactions highlight NECTIN3's role in maintaining cell junction integrity and facilitating immune cell migration.
