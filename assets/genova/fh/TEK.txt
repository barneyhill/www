# TEK

## Overview
The TEK gene encodes the TEK receptor tyrosine kinase, also known as TIE2, a critical component in the regulation of angiogenesis and vascular stability. This receptor is predominantly expressed in endothelial cells and is integral to the maturation and maintenance of blood vessels. The TEK receptor is a transmembrane protein characterized by a complex structure that includes extracellular immunoglobulin-like, EGF-like, and fibronectin type III-like domains, as well as an intracellular split tyrosine kinase domain essential for its catalytic activity (Dumont1994Dominantnegative; Sato1993Tie1). TEK interacts with angiopoietins, particularly Angiopoietin-1 and Angiopoietin-2, to modulate endothelial cell functions such as survival, migration, and permeability, thereby influencing vascular development and homeostasis (Maisonpierre1997Angiopoietin2; Davis1996Isolation). The receptor's activation through ligand-induced dimerization and subsequent phosphorylation is crucial for downstream signaling pathways that support endothelial cell proliferation and vascular integrity (Dumont1994Dominantnegative; Du2018Mechanisms). Mutations in the TEK gene are associated with various vascular and ocular diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Vikkula1996Vascular; Souma2016Angiopoietin).

## Structure
The TEK receptor tyrosine kinase, also known as TIE2, is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. The primary structure of TEK features a signal peptide, followed by extracellular domains composed of two immunoglobulin-like loops, three epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats, and three fibronectin type III-like repeats (Dumont1994Dominantnegative; Sato1993Tie1). The intracellular portion contains a split tyrosine kinase domain, which is crucial for its catalytic activity (Dumont1994Dominantnegative).

The secondary and tertiary structures involve these domains forming specific folds that facilitate ligand binding and signal transduction. The extracellular domain's cell adhesion motifs suggest roles in cellular motility and recognition, which are essential for its function in endothelial cell survival and proliferation (Dumont1994Dominantnegative).

In terms of quaternary structure, TEK is known to dimerize, a common feature among receptor tyrosine kinases, which is essential for its activation and signaling (Finger2009The). Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, are critical for TEK's activation and function (Dumont1994Dominantnegative). The TEK gene may also produce splice variant isoforms, which could have distinct functional roles, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
The TEK gene encodes the TEK receptor tyrosine kinase, also known as TIE2, which plays a critical role in angiogenesis and vascular stability. This receptor is primarily expressed in endothelial cells and is essential for the maturation and maintenance of blood vessels. TEK interacts with angiopoietins, particularly Angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) and Angiopoietin-2 (Ang2), to regulate endothelial cell survival, migration, and permeability, impacting vascular development and homeostasis (Maisonpierre1997Angiopoietin2; Davis1996Isolation).

In healthy cells, TEK is initially in an inactive state due to autoinhibition. Ligand-induced dimerization leads to trans-phosphorylation of key tyrosine residues, activating the receptor. This activation recruits downstream signaling proteins, which regulate various pathways crucial for cell growth and migration (Du2018Mechanisms). TEK is involved in the maintenance and proliferation of endothelial cells, which is necessary for maintaining vascular integrity during development (Dumont1994Dominantnegative).

TEK signaling is crucial for the proper development of the cardiovascular system, as its absence can lead to significant developmental abnormalities, including compromised vasculature and heart development issues (Dumont1994Dominantnegative).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TEK gene, which encodes the TEK receptor tyrosine kinase, are implicated in several diseases, primarily affecting vascular and ocular systems. In primary congenital glaucoma (PCG), TEK mutations lead to impaired aqueous humor outflow due to defective Schlemm's canal development, resulting in elevated intraocular pressure and optic nerve damage. These mutations can cause loss of protein function through mechanisms such as impaired phosphorylation and altered subcellular localization (Souma2016Angiopoietin). TEK mutations in PCG follow a dominant inheritance pattern with variable expressivity, contributing to differences in disease severity and onset (Souma2016Angiopoietin).

TEK is also associated with venous malformations (VMs), where gain-of-function mutations enhance kinase activity, leading to abnormal vascular development (Vikkula1996Vascular). In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), reduced TEK expression correlates with lower survival rates, suggesting its role as a prognostic marker. TEK down-regulation in ccRCC promotes tumor growth and metastasis by enhancing epithelial-mesenchymal transition and inhibiting apoptosis (Chen2021The). Additionally, certain TEK gene SNPs are linked to asthma and allergic conjunctivitis, indicating its involvement in inflammatory pathways (Gál2020Investigation).

## Interactions
The TEK receptor tyrosine kinase, also known as TIE2, interacts with several proteins that play crucial roles in vascular stability and permeability. TEK primarily interacts with angiopoietins, particularly Angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) and Angiopoietin-2 (Ang2). Ang1 acts as an agonist, promoting the assembly of a signaling complex involving TEK, which is essential for maintaining vascular stability. This complex can recruit VE-PTP, a phosphatase that dephosphorylates TEK, thereby influencing vascular permeability (Eklund2016Angiopoietin–Tie; Milam2014The). Ang2, on the other hand, can antagonize the stabilizing effects of Ang1-TEK signaling, acting as a natural antagonist for TEK and disrupting angiogenesis by blocking its activation (Maisonpierre1997Angiopoietin2).

TEK also interacts with other proteins such as VE-cadherin and VEGFR2, which are involved in endothelial cell junction integrity and vascular permeability. The interaction with VE-cadherin is crucial for maintaining endothelial barrier function, while the interaction with VEGFR2 influences endothelial cell junction disassembly (Eklund2016Angiopoietin–Tie). These interactions highlight the role of TEK in regulating vascular homeostasis and its potential implications in pathological conditions like tumor angiogenesis.
