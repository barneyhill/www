# SERPINA6

## Overview
SERPINA6 is a gene that encodes the protein corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), a member of the serpin superfamily, which is primarily involved in the transport and regulation of glucocorticoids and progesterone in the bloodstream. CBG is a serine protease inhibitor that plays a critical role in maintaining hormonal balance and modulating stress responses by binding approximately 80%-90% of circulating cortisol, thereby regulating its bioavailability and distribution to target tissues (Bankier2023Plasma; Bolton2014Genome). The protein's structure, characterized by a conserved serpin domain and reactive center loop, is essential for its function in hormone transport and inhibition (Silverman2001The; Gatto2013Serpins). Genetic variations in the SERPINA6 gene can influence CBG production and function, impacting cortisol signaling and associated physiological processes (Crawford2021Variation).

## Structure
SERPINA6 encodes corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), a member of the serpin superfamily, which is characterized by a conserved structure and a unique inhibitory mechanism. The primary structure of CBG consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the polypeptide chain. The secondary structure includes three β-sheets and eight or nine α-helices, which are crucial for its stability and function (SanchezNavarro2020Integrative; Gatto2013Serpins). The tertiary structure involves the 3D folding of the protein, stabilizing its functional conformation, which is necessary for its role in hormone transport (Silverman2001The).

CBG contains a serpin domain, which is essential for its function as a serine protease inhibitor. This domain includes a reactive center loop (RCL) that interacts with specific substrates, playing a critical role in its inhibitory mechanism (Silverman2001The; Gatto2013Serpins). Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are common in CBG, affecting its stability and function (Gatto2013Serpins). Splice variants of SERPINA6 can result in different isoforms, potentially leading to distinct functional properties (Gatto2013Serpins). These structural features enable CBG to effectively bind and transport corticosteroids in the bloodstream.

## Function
The SERPINA6 gene encodes corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), a plasma protein primarily produced in the liver. CBG plays a crucial role in the transport and regulation of cortisol, a steroid hormone involved in various physiological processes such as metabolism, immune response, and stress response. In the bloodstream, CBG binds approximately 80%-90% of cortisol, regulating its bioavailability and ensuring its proper distribution to target tissues (Bankier2023Plasma; Bolton2014Genome).

CBG's binding to cortisol is essential for maintaining the balance between free and bound cortisol, with free cortisol being the active form that can signal through intracellular glucocorticoid receptors in target tissues. This regulation is significant for modulating tissue glucocorticoid action and influencing cardiovascular risk (Bankier2023Plasma). Genetic variations in the SERPINA6 locus can affect CBG production, impacting cortisol signaling in peripheral tissues such as visceral abdominal fat and subcutaneous fat (Crawford2021Variation).

The protein's activity is not limited to the liver; it also plays a role in delivering cortisol to peripheral tissues, which is supported by evidence showing that mutations in SERPINA6 or deletion of CBG result in features consistent with cortisol deficiency (Crawford2021Variation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and genetic variations in the SERPINA6 gene, which encodes corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), have significant clinical implications. Alterations in SERPINA6 can lead to changes in CBG levels, affecting cortisol transport and availability in the bloodstream. Rare mutations in SERPINA6 may result in absent or reduced affinity of CBG for cortisol, leading to low total plasma cortisol levels but normal free cortisol levels. This condition can cause symptoms such as fatigue and abnormal cortisol pulsatility, which do not respond to cortisol supplementation (Bolton2014Genome).

Genetic variations in the SERPINA6/SERPINA1 locus have been associated with increased risks of cardiovascular diseases, such as chronic ischemic heart disease and myocardial infarction. These variations influence morning plasma cortisol levels and hepatic CBG expression, potentially affecting cortisol delivery to peripheral tissues (Crawford2021Variation).

In addition, the SERPINA6-rs1998056 variant has been linked to an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in females, suggesting a role in the sexual dimorphism of this disease. This variant is co-regulated by FOXA/ERα, highlighting the complex interactions between genetic factors and disease risk (Shen2014Integrative).

## Interactions
SERPINA6, also known as corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), is a protein that primarily binds and transports glucocorticoids and progesterone in the bloodstream. It plays a crucial role in regulating the bioavailability of these hormones, which are essential for maintaining hormonal balance and modulating stress responses. SERPINA6 interacts with various proteins, including albumin, to facilitate the transport and regulation of corticosteroids.

The protein encoded by SERPINA6 is involved in the formation of complexes with glucocorticoids, which are critical for their transport in the blood. This interaction is essential for maintaining the appropriate levels of free and bound hormones, thereby influencing their physiological effects. The binding of glucocorticoids to CBG is a dynamic process that can be influenced by various factors, including genetic variations within the SERPINA6 gene itself. These variations can affect the binding affinity and capacity of CBG, leading to alterations in hormone levels and potentially impacting stress response and other physiological processes (Bolton2014Genome).

Additionally, SERPINA6 is located in a genomic region that includes the SERPINA1 gene, which encodes alpha-1-antitrypsin. This protein can inhibit the release of cortisol from CBG, suggesting a potential interaction between these proteins in regulating cortisol availability (Bolton2014Genome).
