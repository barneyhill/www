# FARSB

## Overview
The FARSB gene encodes the beta subunit of the enzyme phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase, which is a critical component of the protein synthesis machinery. This enzyme belongs to the class of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which are responsible for attaching specific amino acids to their corresponding tRNA molecules, a fundamental step in translating genetic information into functional proteins. The phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase is a heterotetrameric complex composed of two alpha subunits, encoded by the FARSA gene, and two beta subunits, encoded by the FARSB gene. This complex plays a vital role in ensuring the fidelity of protein translation, which is essential for proper cellular function and development (Wang2023FARSB; Guo2023PhenylalanyltRNA). Beyond its primary role in protein synthesis, FARSB is involved in various cellular processes and has been linked to several diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Wang2023FARSB).

## Function
The FARSB gene encodes the beta subunit of the phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (PheRS) complex, a crucial enzyme in protein synthesis. This enzyme operates in the cytoplasm and is responsible for attaching phenylalanine to its corresponding tRNA, a critical step in translating genetic information into proteins (Wang2023FARSB; Guo2023PhenylalanyltRNA). The PheRS complex is a hetero-tetramer composed of two alpha subunits encoded by the FARSA gene and two beta subunits encoded by the FARSB gene. This structure ensures the accurate decoding of mRNA during protein synthesis, which is vital for maintaining cellular function and organismal development (Guo2023PhenylalanyltRNA; Schuch2021FARS1‐related).

Beyond its canonical role in protein translation, FARSB has been implicated in various cellular processes and diseases. It is associated with neurodegenerative diseases, diffuse brain calcification, and cirrhosis due to gene mutations. In the context of cancer, FARSB has been shown to activate the mTORC1 signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell growth and proliferation (Wang2023FARSB). These findings highlight the importance of FARSB in maintaining normal cellular functions and its potential involvement in disease pathogenesis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FARSB gene are associated with a range of diseases and conditions. Biallelic mutations in FARSB can lead to neurodegenerative diseases and diffuse brain calcification, as well as cirrhosis (Wang2023FARSB). FARSB is also implicated in the progression of various tumors, including colorectal cancer, where it may act as a downstream gene of the tumor suppressor IGFBP7 (Wang2023FARSB). In lung adenocarcinoma, FARSB has been identified as a hub gene for tobacco-related methylation probes (Wang2023FARSB).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), FARSB is highly expressed and associated with poor prognosis. Its overexpression activates the mTORC1 signaling pathway, promoting cancer progression by enhancing cell proliferation and migration, and inhibiting ferroptosis, a form of cell death (Wang2023FARSB). Hypomethylation of the FARSB promoter in HCC patients leads to its high expression, correlating with poor outcomes (Wang2023FARSB).

FARSB is also linked to neurodevelopmental disorders affecting the brain, liver, and lungs, although there is no direct evidence connecting it to Alzheimer's disease (Song2023Identification). These findings suggest that FARSB could serve as a biomarker and therapeutic target in various conditions.

## Interactions
The FARSB gene encodes the beta subunit of phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase, which forms a functional heterotetramer with the alpha subunit encoded by the FARSA gene. This complex is crucial for the conjugation of phenylalanine to its cognate tRNA, a key step in protein synthesis (Guo2023PhenylalanyltRNA). The interaction between FARSB and FARSA is essential for the structural integrity and function of the heterotetramer, with specific residues playing critical roles in maintaining this interaction. For instance, mutations in FARSA, such as P347L and R404C, disrupt the interface with FARSB, preventing stable heterotetramer formation (Kim2022Fatal).

FARSB also interacts with Raptor, a component of the mTORC1 signaling pathway, in the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This interaction is suggested to suppress Raptor phosphorylation, thereby activating the mTORC1 pathway and promoting cancer progression (Wang2023FARSB). The interaction between FARSB and Raptor has been demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence co-localization studies (Wang2023FARSB). These interactions highlight the multifaceted roles of FARSB in both protein synthesis and cellular signaling pathways.
