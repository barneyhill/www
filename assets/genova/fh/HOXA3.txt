# HOXA3

## Overview
HOXA3 is a gene that encodes the homeobox A3 protein, a transcription factor belonging to the homeobox gene family, which plays a pivotal role in embryonic development and cellular differentiation. The homeobox A3 protein is characterized by its ability to bind DNA and regulate the expression of target genes, thereby influencing various developmental processes, including hematopoiesis, endothelial cell differentiation, and angiogenesis. As a transcription factor, homeobox A3 is involved in the modulation of gene expression patterns critical for the development of the thymus and the maturation of thymocytes, as well as maintaining endothelial identity by inhibiting hematopoietic differentiation. The gene's expression is tightly regulated during embryogenesis, reflecting its specific roles in developmental pathways. Alterations in HOXA3 expression have been implicated in several pathological conditions, including congenital heart disease and various cancers, underscoring its importance in both normal development and disease states (Iacovino2010HoxA3; Chen2019The; Wang2024Role).

## Function
HOXA3 is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in various developmental processes, particularly in the regulation of hematopoiesis and endothelial cell differentiation. In the context of hematopoiesis, HOXA3 is involved in the modulation of adhesion molecules and transcription factors, influencing cell migration and hematopoietic differentiation. It has been shown to regulate the expression of the Pax1 gene, which is crucial for thymus development and thymocyte maturation, indicating its role in early thymus and thymocyte development (van1999The).

HOXA3 also plays a critical role in maintaining endothelial identity by restraining hematopoietic differentiation. It achieves this by downregulating key hematopoietic transcription factors such as Runx1, Gata1, Gfi1B, Ikaros, and PU.1, thereby preventing the hematopoietic program from arising in endothelial progenitors (Iacovino2010HoxA3). The expression of HOXA3 is temporally regulated, being present in the embryonic vasculature but absent from the yolk sac, highlighting its specific role in embryonic development (Iacovino2010HoxA3).

In the context of angiogenesis, HOXA3 expression decreases during the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into endothelial cells, suggesting its involvement in the regulation of endothelial cell differentiation (Chung2007HOX).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the HOXA3 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In congenital heart disease (CHD), HOXA3 plays a critical role, with specific expression patterns during heart development. Mutations in this gene can lead to malformations in the carotid artery system (Wang2024Role). In the context of cancer, HOXA3 is involved in various malignancies. It acts as a tumor suppressor in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where its expression is decreased, and hypermethylation of CpG sites in the HOXA3/HOXA4 region is linked to cancer progression (Wang2024Role). In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), HOXA3 is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis by promoting aerobic glycolysis (Wang2024Role). 

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), HOXA3 is highly expressed, and its overexpression is correlated with poor overall survival, making it a potential prognostic marker (Chen2019The). In pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), HOXA3 shows differential expression among subtypes, particularly distinguishing between BCP-ALLs and T-ALLs (Starkova2010HOX). Alterations in HOXA3 expression are also linked to increased glucocorticoid resistance in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines (Wang2024Role). These findings highlight the clinical significance of HOXA3 in various diseases, particularly in its role in cancer progression and developmental anomalies.

## Interactions
HOXA3 is known to interact with several proteins and nucleic acids, forming complexes that are crucial for its function as a transcription factor. It selectively binds to specific DNA motifs, such as TGATTCAT, in cooperation with PBX and MEIS proteins, forming a ternary complex that is essential for its binding specificity and transcriptional activation roles (Bridoux2019HOX). This interaction is not significantly altered by swapping the DNA-binding homeodomains between HOXA2 and HOXA3, suggesting that residues outside the homeodomain are responsible for these interactions (Bridoux2019HOX).

HOXA3 also shows direct cooperativity with MEIS transcription factors, enhancing MEIS binding to potentially lower-affinity sites across the genome. This interaction is reciprocal, as co-occupancy with MEIS enhances HOXA3 binding as well (Bridoux2019HOX). In addition, HOXA3's interaction with FOXC1 enhances transcriptional activation, particularly in the posterior branchial arches, indicating a role in tissue-specific enhancer activity (Bridoux2019HOX).

In terms of translation regulation, HOXA3 mRNA contains translation inhibitory elements (TIEs) that interact with specific translation-related proteins, such as eIF2D, which is involved in the initiation of translation on specific mRNAs (Alghoul2021Translation).
