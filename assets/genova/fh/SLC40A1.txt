# SLC40A1

## Overview
The SLC40A1 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 40 member 1, commonly known as ferroportin, which is a transmembrane protein integral to iron homeostasis in vertebrates. Ferroportin is the sole known iron exporter in mammals, facilitating the transport of iron from cells such as enterocytes, macrophages, hepatocytes, and placental cells into the bloodstream. This protein is a member of the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) and is characterized by its 12 transmembrane helices, which are essential for its function in iron transport (Debbiche2024Insights; Montalbetti2013Mammalian). The activity of ferroportin is tightly regulated by the hormone hepcidin, which binds to ferroportin, leading to its internalization and degradation, thereby controlling iron absorption and distribution in the body (De2011Hepcidin; Nemeth2004Hepcidin). Mutations in the SLC40A1 gene can lead to disorders such as hemochromatosis type 4, highlighting its clinical significance in iron metabolism (Le2021Splicing; Zhang2018A).

## Structure
The SLC40A1 gene encodes the ferroportin protein, a crucial iron export protein in mammals. The primary structure of ferroportin consists of 570 amino acids, with a predicted mass of approximately 62 kDa (Montalbetti2013Mammalian). The protein is a member of the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) and is characterized by 12 transmembrane helices organized into two bundles of six helices each, exhibiting pseudo-symmetry (Debbiche2024Insights). These helices are further divided into core, interfacial, and external helices, which are essential for its function in iron transport (Debbiche2024Insights).

Ferroportin undergoes significant conformational changes to transport iron across the plasma membrane, transitioning through at least five states: outward-facing, outward-occluded, occluded, inward-occluded, and inward-facing (Debbiche2024Insights). The protein's stability and function are influenced by non-covalent interactions, including salt bridges and hydrogen bonds, particularly involving motif A, which links the N- and C-terminal domains (Debbiche2024Insights). Specific amino acids, such as Lys90, Arg179, Arg365, Lys366, and Arg371, interact with lipid molecules and stabilize the protein's outward-facing conformation (Debbiche2024Insights). Mutations in these residues can affect the protein's function and are associated with ferroportin disease (Debbiche2024Insights). The quaternary structure of ferroportin is debated, with uncertainty about whether it exists as a monomer, dimer, or multimer (Montalbetti2013Mammalian).

## Function
The SLC40A1 gene encodes ferroportin, a transmembrane protein essential for iron homeostasis in humans. Ferroportin is the only known iron exporter in vertebrates and is primarily active in enterocytes, macrophages, hepatocytes, and placental cells. It facilitates the export of iron from these cells into the bloodstream, playing a crucial role in maintaining systemic iron levels (Donovan2005The; Wang2011Regulation).

Ferroportin's activity is tightly regulated by the peptide hormone hepcidin. Hepcidin binds to ferroportin, inducing its internalization and degradation, which decreases iron export from cells. This interaction is central to controlling iron absorption and distribution in the body, preventing iron overload (De2011Hepcidin; Nemeth2004Hepcidin). The regulation of ferroportin by hepcidin forms a homeostatic loop, where increased plasma iron levels stimulate hepcidin production, leading to reduced ferroportin activity and iron retention within cells (Nemeth2004Hepcidin).

Ferroportin is also involved in iron recycling, particularly in macrophages, where it exports iron recovered from phagocytosed erythrocytes. This function is vital for maintaining iron availability for erythropoiesis and overall iron balance in the organism (Donovan2005The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC40A1 gene, which encodes the iron exporter ferroportin, are associated with hemochromatosis type 4, also known as ferroportin disease. This condition is characterized by iron overload and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Hemochromatosis type 4 is divided into two subtypes: type 4A (classical ferroportin disease) and type 4B (non-classical ferroportin disease). Type 4A is caused by loss-of-function mutations that impair iron export, leading to iron accumulation in tissue macrophages and low or normal plasma iron levels. In contrast, type 4B results from gain-of-function mutations that make ferroportin resistant to hepcidin, causing iron deposition in hepatocytes and high transferrin saturation (Le2021Splicing; Zhang2018A).

A notable mutation, p.Y333H, has been identified in Chinese patients and is associated with a gain-of-function effect, leading to significant iron overload and conditions such as liver cirrhosis and diabetes mellitus (Zhang2018A). This mutation is resistant to hepcidin, affecting the internalization and degradation of ferroportin, and represents a significant etiological factor of hemochromatosis in China (Zhang2018A). Genetic testing is recommended for family members due to the hereditary nature of the disease (Pietrangelo2017Ferroportin).

## Interactions
The SLC40A1 gene encodes ferroportin, a transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in iron homeostasis. Ferroportin interacts with hephaestin (Heph) in the duodenal epithelium, forming complexes that are essential for iron transport. These complexes can be detected using BN/SDS-PAGE, where ferroportin is found as dimers or monomers in association with Heph, which appears as a monomer or fragment depending on the complex (Yeh2009Iron). The interaction between ferroportin and Heph is confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation experiments, indicating a physical association that facilitates iron export from enterocytes (Yeh2009Iron).

Ferroportin also interacts with hepcidin, a liver-derived peptide that regulates iron levels by binding to ferroportin, leading to its internalization and degradation. This interaction is a key mechanism in controlling iron absorption and maintaining systemic iron balance (Montalbetti2013Mammalian; Le2017Deciphering). Additionally, the function of ferroportin is influenced by its interactions with glycerophospholipids, which stabilize its conformation and are crucial for its iron export activity. Specific amino acid residues in ferroportin interact with lipid molecules, affecting its stability and function (Debbiche2024Insights).
