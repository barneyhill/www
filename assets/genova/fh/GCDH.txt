# GCDH

## Overview
The GCDH gene encodes the mitochondrial enzyme glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase, which plays a critical role in the catabolism of the amino acids lysine, hydroxylysine, and tryptophan. This enzyme is categorized as a dehydrogenase and is essential for the oxidative decarboxylation of glutaryl-CoA to crotonyl-CoA, a key step in amino acid degradation pathways (Ribeiro2020Functional; Schmiesing2017Diseasecausing). The enzyme functions as a homotetramer, with each monomer containing a non-covalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor necessary for its activity (Ribeiro2020Functional; Schmiesing2017Diseasecausing). Proper functioning of glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase is crucial for preventing the accumulation of toxic metabolites, such as glutaric acid and 3-hydroxyglutaric acid, which can lead to neurometabolic disorders if not adequately degraded (CudréCung2019Ammonium; Schmiesing2017Diseasecausing). Mutations in the GCDH gene are associated with glutaric aciduria type 1 (GA1), a metabolic disorder characterized by neurological damage due to the accumulation of these metabolites (Zschocke2000Mutation; Kölker2007Guideline).

## Structure
The GCDH protein is a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the catabolism of lysine, hydroxylysine, and tryptophan. It is synthesized as a precursor protein with 438 amino acids, including a 44 amino acid mitochondrial targeting sequence that is cleaved upon import into the mitochondria (Schmiesing2014Interaction). The mature protein forms a homotetramer, with each monomer containing a non-covalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) molecule, essential for its enzymatic activity (Ribeiro2020Potential; Schmiesing2017Diseasecausing).

The primary structure of GCDH is its amino acid sequence, while the secondary structure includes an N-terminal helical bundle (helices A-F) and a C-terminal helical bundle (helices G-K), connected by an immunoglobulin-like β-sandwich (Schmiesing2017Diseasecausing). The tertiary structure involves the overall three-dimensional shape of a single monomer, with the FAD ligand situated between the C-terminal bundle and the β-sandwich (Schmiesing2017Diseasecausing). The quaternary structure is a tetrameric assembly, crucial for its function, with the ligand-binding site located between two adjacent monomers (Schmiesing2017Diseasecausing).

Mutations in GCDH can affect its stability and function, impacting the protein's ability to form tetramers and interact with other mitochondrial proteins (Ribeiro2020Functional; Schmiesing2017Diseasecausing).

## Function
The GCDH gene encodes the enzyme glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase, which is crucial for the catabolism of the amino acids lysine, hydroxylysine, and tryptophan. This enzyme is located in the mitochondrial matrix and catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of glutaryl-CoA to crotonyl-CoA, a key step in the degradation pathway of these amino acids (Ribeiro2020Functional; Schmiesing2017Diseasecausing). The enzyme functions as a homotetramer, with each monomer containing a non-covalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (Ribeiro2020Functional; Schmiesing2017Diseasecausing).

In healthy cells, GCDH forms both homo- and heteromeric complexes with other mitochondrial proteins, such as dihydrolipoamide S-succinyltransferase (DLST) and the electron transfer flavoprotein subunit beta (ETFB). These interactions suggest that GCDH is part of multienzyme complexes involved in mitochondrial energy metabolism (Schmiesing2014Interaction). The electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) transfers electrons from GCDH to the respiratory chain, which is crucial for cellular energy production (Schmiesing2014Interaction).

The proper function of GCDH is essential for preventing the accumulation of toxic metabolites such as glutaric acid and 3-hydroxyglutaric acid, which can lead to neurometabolic disorders if not adequately degraded (CudréCung2019Ammonium; Schmiesing2017Diseasecausing).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GCDH gene, which encodes the mitochondrial enzyme glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase, are responsible for glutaric aciduria type 1 (GA1), an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder. GA1 is characterized by the accumulation of glutaric acid and 3-hydroxyglutaric acid, leading to neurological damage, particularly in early childhood. This condition often results in severe dystonic dyskinetic movement disorders following encephalopathic crises, which can be triggered by infections, immunizations, or surgery (Zschocke2000Mutation; Kölker2007Guideline).

The clinical presentation of GA1 varies significantly, with some patients exhibiting severe phenotypes while others have milder forms. This variability is partly due to the genetic heterogeneity of GCDH mutations, with over 150 mutations identified, including common mutations like R402W in European populations and V400M and R227P in Spanish patients (Busquets2000GlutarylCoA; Zschocke2000Mutation). Some mutations, such as R402W, are associated with severe phenotypes, while others, like V400M, are linked to milder, low-excretor phenotypes (Barroso2023GlutarylCoA).

The disorder's prevalence is about 1 in 100,000 newborns, with higher frequencies in certain genetic isolates, such as the Amish and Irish Travellers (Kölker2007Guideline). Early diagnosis and management, including dietary interventions and L-carnitine supplementation, can significantly reduce the frequency of encephalopathic crises and improve outcomes (Kölker2007Guideline).

## Interactions
Glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (GCDH) is known to interact with several mitochondrial proteins, forming part of multienzyme complexes crucial for metabolic pathways. GCDH directly binds to dihydrolipoamide S-succinyltransferase (DLST) and electron transfer flavoprotein subunit beta (ETFB), both of which are involved in lysine and tryptophan degradation pathways (Schmiesing2014Interaction). These interactions are essential for the formation of the glutaryl-CoA substrate and electron transfer processes (Schmiesing2017Diseasecausing).

The interaction with DLST is largely mediated by a single amino acid residue, p.Tyr155, and mutations at this site can decrease binding affinity, affecting the stability and formation of heteromeric complexes (Schmiesing2017Diseasecausing). GCDH also forms heteromeric complexes with ETFB, and certain mutations in GCDH can increase its binding affinity to ETFB, potentially disrupting electron flux and GCDH activity (Schmiesing2017Diseasecausing).

These interactions have been confirmed through various experimental methods, including affinity chromatography, coprecipitation, and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assays, which have demonstrated the specificity and importance of these protein-protein interactions within the mitochondrial matrix (Schmiesing2014Interaction; Schmiesing2017Diseasecausing).
