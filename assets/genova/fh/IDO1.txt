# IDO1

## Overview
Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is a gene that encodes the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1, a heme-containing dioxygenase involved in the catabolism of the essential amino acid tryptophan. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the kynurenine pathway, initiating the conversion of tryptophan to N-formylkynurenine, which subsequently leads to the production of metabolites that are crucial for immune regulation and tolerance (Pallotta2021Indoleamine; Mbongue2015The). IDO1 is expressed in various cell types, including immune and epithelial cells, and is particularly active in immune-privileged sites. It is rapidly induced by inflammatory cytokines such as interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) (Fallarino2012Indoleamine; Yeung2015Role). Beyond its enzymatic function, IDO1 also acts as a signaling molecule, participating in immune modulation through enzyme activity-independent pathways, thus classifying it as a 'moonlighting' protein (Pallotta2021Indoleamine; Yeung2015Role). The multifaceted roles of IDO1 in immune regulation and its implications in various diseases, including cancer and infectious diseases, make it a significant focus of research and a potential therapeutic target.

## Structure
Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is a heme-containing enzyme involved in the catabolism of tryptophan. The primary structure of IDO1 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain. Its secondary structure is characterized by two α-helical domains, which are crucial for its function (Sugimoto2006Crystal). The tertiary structure of IDO1 includes a heme group situated between these α-helical domains, which is essential for its catalytic activity (Sugimoto2006Crystal). The heme group is coordinated to the active site by a histidine imidazole, specifically His346 (Lancellotti2011Biochemical).

IDO1 can form homodimers, representing its quaternary structure (Pham2019Structural). The enzyme has a conserved fold with a large domain containing the catalytic cleft and a small domain featuring two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs; Y111, Y249) associated with its noncatalytic signaling function (Pallotta2021Indoleamine). The large and small domains are connected by a DE-loop, and a JK-loop controls access to the catalytic site (Pallotta2021Indoleamine).

Post-translational modifications of IDO1 include phosphorylation, which affects its function and stability. Phosphorylation of ITIMs can lead to interactions with proteins such as SOCS3, SHP-1, and SHP-2, influencing IDO1's immunoregulatory roles (Albini2016Distinct).

## Function
Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is a crucial enzyme in the kynurenine pathway, catalyzing the initial and rate-limiting step in the degradation of the essential amino acid L-tryptophan to N-formylkynurenine. This process results in the production of several biologically active metabolites, such as L-kynurenine, which play significant roles in immune regulation by modulating T-cell responses and promoting immune tolerance (Pallotta2021Indoleamine; Mbongue2015The).

IDO1 is expressed in various cell types, including dendritic cells, macrophages, and epithelial cells, and is particularly active in immune-privileged sites such as the placenta, lungs, and lymphoid organs. It is rapidly induced by the cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), especially in response to inflammation and infection (Fallarino2012Indoleamine; Yeung2015Role).

Beyond its enzymatic role, IDO1 also functions as a signaling molecule. It can undergo tyrosine phosphorylation, leading to enzyme activity-independent signaling pathways that contribute to immune regulation. This dual role as both an enzyme and a signaling mediator classifies IDO1 as a 'moonlighting' protein, capable of mediating distinct functions based on cellular needs (Pallotta2021Indoleamine; Yeung2015Role).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the IDO1 gene have significant clinical implications in various diseases, particularly in cancer and infectious diseases. In glioblastoma (GBM), high IDO1 expression is associated with decreased patient survival. This is linked to the immunosuppressive environment created by IDO1, which correlates with other immunosuppressive genes and immune cell infiltrates, such as tumor-associated macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (Zhai2017Infiltrating). In colorectal cancer, IDO1 expression at the tumor invasion front is an independent negative prognostic factor for overall survival and the development of metastases, suggesting its role in immune evasion and tumor progression (Ferdinande2011Clinicopathological).

In the context of infectious diseases, genetic polymorphisms in IDO1 are associated with an increased risk of aspergillosis, particularly in cystic fibrosis and hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients. These polymorphisms lead to reduced IDO1 expression and function, resulting in heightened inflammatory responses and increased susceptibility to infection (Napolioni2019Genetic). The impaired function of IDO1 due to specific single nucleotide polymorphisms is linked to increased inflammatory cytokine levels, further exacerbating the risk of aspergillosis (Napolioni2019Genetic). These findings underscore the importance of IDO1 in modulating immune responses and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function and stability. IDO1 contains immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) that, when phosphorylated, serve as docking sites for proteins such as SOCS3, SHP-1, and SHP-2. These interactions are crucial for IDO1's role in immune regulation. SOCS3 binds to phosphorylated ITIMs on IDO1, facilitating its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, which is a key mechanism in regulating immune responses (Orabona2008SOCS3; Albini2016Distinct; Pallotta2014AhRMediated).

IDO1 also interacts with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which enhances its transcription and affects its protein stability through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. AhR can promote IDO1 phosphorylation via Src kinase, influencing its signaling function and synthesis (Pallotta2014AhRMediated).

In colorectal cancer, IDO1 is stabilized by the deubiquitinating enzyme USP14, which prevents its degradation by the E3 ligase TRIM21. This stabilization promotes tryptophan metabolism and immune suppression, highlighting USP14 as a potential therapeutic target (Shi2022USP14). These interactions underscore IDO1's multifaceted role in immune modulation and its potential as a drug target.
