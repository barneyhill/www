# PEG3

## Overview
The PEG3 gene, located on human chromosome 19q13.4, encodes the paternally expressed 3 protein, a Kruppel-type zinc finger protein involved in transcriptional repression. This protein plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including growth regulation, apoptosis, and maternal nurturing behavior. The PEG3 protein is characterized by its zinc finger DNA-binding motifs, a KRAB-A domain, and a SCAN domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its function as a transcriptional repressor. It is particularly active in the nucleus, where it influences gene expression by binding to specific genomic regions. PEG3 is expressed in tissues such as the ovary, placenta, testis, and brain, indicating its involvement in reproductive and neurodevelopmental processes. The gene's imprinting and expression are regulated by DNA methylation, which has implications for its role in cancer and other diseases (Murphy2001Imprinting; He2016PEG3; Kim2013Peg3).

## Structure
The PEG3 protein is a zinc finger DNA-binding protein encoded by an imprinted gene located on human chromosome 19q13.4. It is part of a large zinc finger gene cluster and contains several conserved domains that contribute to its function. The protein features a KRAB-A (Kruppel-Associated Box A) domain at the N-terminus, which is crucial for its interaction with the co-repressor protein KAP1 (Kruppel-Associated Protein 1). This interaction is significant for PEG3's role in transcriptional repression, as KAP1 recruits various epigenetic modification proteins (He2016PEG3).

The C-terminal region of PEG3 contains twelve C2H2 zinc finger motifs, which are highly conserved and likely involved in DNA binding. These motifs are encoded by the last exon, Exon9, and show varying levels of conservation, indicating different functional roles (He2016PEG3). The protein also includes a SCAN domain in Exon3 and a proline-rich domain, with the latter being involved in protein-protein interactions (He2016PEG3).

The PEG3 protein's exon 7 contains a divergent KRAB-A domain, which is essential for its repression function and interaction with KAP1, suggesting a role in regulating downstream genes through histone modifications (He2016PEG3). The presence of these domains and motifs highlights the complex structure of PEG3, which is integral to its function in growth and development regulation.

## Function
The PEG3 gene encodes a Kruppel-type zinc finger protein that plays a significant role in various biological processes, including growth, apoptosis, and maternal nurturing behavior. In healthy human cells, PEG3 is involved in regulating cell growth and may act as a susceptibility locus for cancer and neurobehavioral deficits (Murphy2001Imprinting). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it functions as a transcriptional repressor, influencing gene expression by binding to specific genomic regions (Kim2013Peg3). PEG3 interacts with several key proteins, such as TRAF2, affecting the TNF responsive pathway, and SIAH1A, which induces p53-mediated apoptosis. It also inhibits the Wnt signaling pathway by promoting β-catenin degradation (Kim2013Peg3).

PEG3 is expressed at high levels in the ovary, placenta, testis, and brain, suggesting its involvement in reproductive and neurodevelopmental processes (Kim1997The; Murphy2001Imprinting). The gene's imprinting is regulated through a CpG island, and its expression can be affected by DNA methylation, which is relevant in the context of certain cancers (Kim2013Peg3). The presence of multiple isoforms, such as PEG3α and PEG3β, indicates diverse roles in different tissues (Murphy2001Imprinting).

## Clinical Significance
The PEG3 gene is implicated in various cancers due to its role in tumor suppression and its regulation by DNA methylation. In colon cancer, PEG3 is identified as the only imprinted gene affecting prognosis, with lower methylation levels at the cg13960339 site associated with poorer outcomes. PEG3's methylation status is linked to increased sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil treatment, suggesting therapeutic implications (The; p&gt; Zhou2019&lt).

In ovarian cancer, PEG3 is frequently down-regulated due to promoter hypermethylation and loss of heterozygosity, contributing to tumorigenesis. Re-expression of PEG3 can suppress cancer cell growth, highlighting its potential as a tumor suppressor (Feng2008Imprinted).

PEG3 is also involved in gliomas, where its expression is often silenced by aberrant methylation. This silencing is associated with tumor development, and reintroduction of PEG3 into glioma cells has been shown to reduce tumorigenicity (Kohda2001Tumour; Maegawa2001Epigenetic).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, PEG3 expression is linked to poor prognosis, particularly in Asian patients, and is associated with the activation of the Erk/mTOR signaling pathway (Luo2022Mutant). These findings underscore the clinical significance of PEG3 in cancer prognosis and treatment.

## Interactions
PEG3 is known to participate in various protein interactions that influence its role as a transcriptional repressor and its involvement in cellular processes. PEG3 interacts with components of the mammalian MSL (male-specific lethal) complex, specifically Msl1 and Msl3, which are involved in histone modification and transcriptional activation. The removal of PEG3 leads to the up-regulation of Msl1 and Msl3, increasing global H4K16ac levels, which confirms PEG3's role as a transcriptional repressor (Ye2017PEG3).

PEG3 also interacts with KAP1, a co-repressor protein, through its KRAB-A domain. This interaction is crucial for PEG3's repressive functions, as KAP1 is known to associate with various histone-modifying proteins. The interaction between PEG3 and KAP1 suggests that PEG3 may exert its repressive effects through histone modifications (He2016PEG3).

In the context of autophagy, PEG3 interacts with Beclin 1 and LC3, key autophagic markers. This interaction is facilitated by decorin, which enhances PEG3 stability and promotes the recruitment of autophagic components, leading to the induction of autophagy in endothelial cells (Buraschi2013Decorin).
