# SUGCT

## Overview
The SUGCT gene encodes the enzyme succinyl-CoA:glutarate-CoA transferase, a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the metabolic conversion of glutaric acid into succinate and glutaryl-CoA. This enzyme is categorized as a type-III CoA transferase and plays a crucial role in metabolite repair by preventing the urinary loss of glutaric acid, thus maintaining carbon balance in human cells (Leandro2020Glutaric; Khamrui2024Characterization). Despite its biochemical activity, SUGCT deficiency, known as glutaric aciduria type 3 (GA3), is often asymptomatic and not associated with significant clinical disease, although some individuals may exhibit mild symptoms (Leandro2020Glutaric). The enzyme's structure is characterized by an interlocking dimer formation, with a conserved catalytic site that accommodates various substrates, highlighting its evolutionary conservation with prokaryotic counterparts (Khamrui2024Characterization). Research on SUGCT, including knockout studies in mice, suggests its involvement in broader metabolic processes and potential implications in metabolic disorders (NiskaBlakie2019Knockout).

## Structure
The human succinyl-CoA:glutarate-CoA transferase (SUGCT) protein is characterized by its interlocking dimer formation, with the active site located at the interface of the two monomers. The conserved catalytic residue Asp212 is crucial for catalysis and is positioned within the active site (Khamrui2024Characterization). The SUGCT structure is highly conserved with prokaryotic type-III CoA transferases, despite low sequence identity, and features a large and open active site that accommodates various substrates (Khamrui2024Characterization). 

The protein's tertiary structure was elucidated using molecular replacement with the AlphaFold V2 structure as a search model, revealing significant details about its dimeric assembly (Khamrui2024Characterization). The study also identified a novel pocket formed by residues from both chains of the dimer, which is crucial for inhibitor binding. This pocket is created by large rotations of side chains from residues Trp91, Tyr102, and His253 (Khamrui2024Characterization). 

The SUGCT protein is encoded by the C7orf10 gene and is involved in the conversion of glutaric acid into succinate and glutaryl-CoA, playing a significant role in metabolic pathways (Khamrui2024Characterization).

## Function
The SUGCT gene encodes the enzyme succinyl-CoA:glutarate-CoA transferase, which is involved in the conversion of glutaric acid into glutaryl-CoA. This process is crucial for preventing the urinary loss of glutaric acid, a dicarboxylic acid derived from glutaryl-CoA, thereby playing a role in metabolite repair by preventing carbon loss in healthy human cells (Leandro2020Glutaric). SUGCT is a mitochondrial enzyme, and its localization within the mitochondria has been confirmed through various biochemical characterizations (Leandro2020The; Leandro2020Glutaric). 

Although SUGCT is not part of the canonical lysine degradation pathway, it is suggested that a significant fraction of glutaryl-CoA undergoes hydrolysis to glutaric acid before further metabolism by glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase can occur (Leandro2020Glutaric). The enzyme's function is considered to be of questionable clinical significance, as SUGCT deficiency, known as glutaric aciduria type 3 (GA3), is often asymptomatic and not associated with a clinically significant disease (Leandro2020Glutaric). The presence of homozygotes for the SUGCT deficiency variant in population databases without disease symptoms supports this view (Leandro2020Glutaric).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SUGCT gene, which encodes the enzyme succinyl-CoA:glutarate-CoA transferase, are associated with glutaric aciduria type 3 (GA3). This condition is characterized by the accumulation of glutaric acid in the urine due to a deficiency in the enzyme's activity, which impairs the conversion of glutaric acid to glutaryl-CoA (Waters2017Glutaric). Although GA3 is often considered a biochemical phenotype of questionable clinical significance, some individuals with mutations in SUGCT may experience symptoms such as gastroenteritis, developmental delays, and dysmorphic features (Leandro2020Glutaric; NiskaBlakie2019Knockout).

In mice, knockout of the SUGCT gene leads to significant metabolic changes, including increased glutarate levels and lipid imbalances, which resemble a diabetes-like metabolic syndrome. These changes are exacerbated by age and a high-lysine diet, resulting in obesity-related phenotypes and kidney pathologies (NiskaBlakie2019Knockout). The study of SUGCT knockout mice suggests that the gene plays a role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis and that its deficiency can lead to metabolic disorders and inflammation (NiskaBlakie2019Knockout). These findings indicate that SUGCT mutations may contribute to metabolic dysfunctions and should be considered in patients with related disorders.
