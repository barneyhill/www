# ARMC3

## Overview
The ARMC3 gene encodes the armadillo repeat containing 3 protein, which is characterized by the presence of multiple armadillo (ARM) domains. These domains are integral to the protein's role in mediating protein-protein interactions, particularly within the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, which is essential for various cellular processes such as tissue maintenance, oncogenesis, and signal transduction (Rehman2022The). The ARMC3 protein is expressed in a wide range of human tissues, including the brain, skeletal muscles, and reproductive organs, where it plays critical roles in ciliogenesis and male fertility (Huang2021ARMC). Mutations in the ARMC3 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions, including male infertility and neurodevelopmental disorders, underscoring its significance in human health and disease (Huang2021ARMC; Rehman2022The).

## Structure
The ARMC3 gene encodes a protein characterized by the presence of 12 armadillo (ARM) domains, which are 45 amino acid repeats involved in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. These ARM repeats are crucial for various cellular functions, including tissue maintenance, oncogenesis, and signal transduction (Rehman2022The). The most extended transcript of ARMC3, NM_173081.5, is 3718 base pairs long and translates into an 872 amino acid peptide (Rehman2022The). 

A novel splice site variant in ARMC3 has been identified, causing exon-8 skipping and resulting in a truncated protein that affects three ARM repeats (ARM6, ARM7, ARM8). This structural alteration is predicted to lead to mRNA degradation via the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway (Rehman2022The). A splicing variant of ARMC3 has been isolated from the human fetal brain, encoding a 688 amino acid polypeptide with three distinct ARM domains (Rehman2022The).

The tertiary structure of ARMC3 shows significant changes in folding patterns between wild-type and mutant proteins, with the mutant form having more interaction sites and altered amino acid residues (Rehman2022The). However, specific details on the quaternary structure, prominent folds, or common post-translational modifications are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The ARMC3 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in the transduction of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial for numerous cellular functions, including tissue maintenance, oncogenesis, signal transduction, development, cell structure, adhesion and mobility, cell migration, and proliferation (Rehman2022The). The ARMC3 protein contains armadillo repeats, which are known for mediating protein-protein interactions, and is expressed in multiple human tissues such as the brain, skeletal muscles, liver, spleen, thymus, lungs, kidneys, prostate, and testes (Rehman2022The).

In the respiratory system, ARMC3 is implicated in the control of lung ciliogenesis and is coexpressed with the transcription factor FOXJ1, which activates CFAP157 expression. This suggests a role in the development and function of cilia, which are essential for maintaining healthy respiratory function by clearing mucus and debris from the airways (Huang2021ARMC). In reproductive biology, ARMC3 is significantly expressed in highly active sperm, and its proper function is crucial for male fertility. A deletion of exon 11 in the ARMC3 gene can lead to sperm defects and male infertility (Huang2021ARMC).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ARMC3 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. A novel splice site variant in ARMC3 has been associated with non-syndromic persistent developmental stuttering in a consanguineous Pakistani family. This variant causes the skipping of exon-8, leading to a truncated protein and is predicted to result in mRNA degradation through the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway. The study suggests that ARMC3 is a novel candidate gene for stuttering, potentially contributing to neurodevelopmental disorders (Rehman2022The).

In the context of male infertility, ARMC3 is crucial for sperm function. A deletion of exon 11 in the ARMC3 gene can lead to sperm defects and male infertility by causing premature termination of translation, affecting the sequence after the last armadillo repeat in the C-terminal region. This alteration is linked to impaired sperm capacitation and the acrosome reaction (Huang2021ARMC).

In cattle, a frameshift mutation in ARMC3 is associated with a tail stump sperm defect, leading to immotile spermatozoa and reproductive issues. This mutation results in a truncated protein, highlighting the gene's importance in normal spermatogenesis (Pausch2016A).

## Interactions
ARMC3 is involved in several interactions that influence cellular functions. It interacts indirectly with AKAP3, an A-kinase anchor protein, through its ribonuclease-like C-terminus. This interaction is mediated by the hydrolysis of PKIA mRNA, which alleviates the competitive inhibition of PKA, thereby promoting the interaction between AKAP3 and PKA. This process enhances sperm capacitation and the acrosome reaction, crucial for male fertility (Huang2021ARMC).

In the context of neuronal functions, ARMC3 interacts with the Kinesin/Miro/Trak2 complex in a calcium-dependent manner. This interaction regulates mitochondrial dynamics and transport within neurons, which is essential for maintaining proper neuronal function and may have implications in cancer progression (Huang2021ARMC).

A novel splice site variant of ARMC3, identified in a consanguineous Pakistani family, leads to a truncated protein due to exon-8 skipping. This variant affects the protein's interaction with MYCBPAP, altering the number and nature of interaction sites, which suggests a deleterious impact on protein function (Rehman2022The). The wild-type ARMC3 interacts with MYCBPAP through 15 interaction sites involving 12 amino acid residues, while the mutant form interacts through 16 sites with 13 different residues (Rehman2022The).
