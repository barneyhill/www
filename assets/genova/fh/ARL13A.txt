# ARL13A

## Overview
ARL13A is a gene that encodes the protein ADP ribosylation factor like GTPase 13A, which is a member of the ARF family of GTP-binding proteins. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of ciliary function and structure, playing a crucial role in the development and maintenance of cilia, which are hair-like structures on the surface of cells that are essential for cell signaling and movement. Mutations in the ARL13A gene have been associated with Joubert syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by developmental delays and neurological abnormalities. The protein encoded by ARL13A is categorized as a GTPase, which is a type of enzyme that hydrolyzes GTP, a molecule similar to ATP, to GDP, thereby providing energy for various cellular processes (Qiu2020aarFDC).
