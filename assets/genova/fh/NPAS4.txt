# NPAS4

## Overview
Neuronal PAS domain protein 4 (NPAS4) is a gene that encodes a transcription factor belonging to the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-PAS family, which is involved in the regulation of gene expression in response to neuronal activity. The NPAS4 protein is characterized by its bHLH and PAS domains, which facilitate DNA binding and dimerization, respectively, allowing it to function as a transcription factor (Fahim2018Structural; Rossi2021Molecular). It plays a pivotal role in synaptic development and plasticity, particularly in the formation of inhibitory synapses and the regulation of excitatory-inhibitory balance within neural circuits (Fu2020Essential; Bersten2014Regulation). NPAS4 is activated by calcium-dependent signaling pathways following neuronal activity, leading to the transcription of genes involved in synaptic functions and neuroprotection (Fu2020Essential). Additionally, NPAS4 is implicated in DNA repair processes, contributing to the maintenance of genomic stability in neurons (Pollina2023A). Its clinical significance is underscored by its association with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, including intellectual disability and schizophrenia, as well as its role in modulating seizure activity in epilepsy (Shan2017Neuronal; Rossi2021Molecular).

## Structure
The NPAS4 protein is characterized by its basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and PAS domains, which are involved in DNA binding and dimerization, respectively (Fahim2018Structural; Rossi2021Molecular). The protein is intrinsically disordered, with ordered regions primarily in the N-terminal bHLH and PAS domains, while the C-terminal region is largely disordered (Fahim2018Structural). The secondary structure of NPAS4 includes alpha helices, coils, and beta sheets (Fahim2018Structural).

The tertiary structure of NPAS4 has been modeled using computational approaches due to the lack of a suitable structural template for homology modeling. A total of 37 models were generated, with model 9 from LOMET identified as the best predicted structure (Fahim2018Structural). The protein's quaternary structure involves heterodimerization with ARNT or ARNT2, which is essential for its function as a transcription factor (Bersten2014Human; Rossi2021Molecular).

NPAS4 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at multiple sites within the bHLH, PASA, and PASB domains (Fahim2018Structural). The protein also contains potential N-glycosylation sites and numerous O-linked glycosylation sites (Fahim2018Structural).

## Function
NPAS4 (neuronal PAS domain protein 4) is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in regulating gene expression in response to neuronal activity. It is primarily active in the nucleus of neurons, where it influences synaptic development and plasticity, particularly in cortical and hippocampal neurons. NPAS4 is involved in the formation of inhibitory synapses and regulates the development of glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses, which are essential for maintaining the excitatory-inhibitory balance within neural circuits (Fu2020Essential; Bersten2014Regulation).

NPAS4 is activated by calcium-dependent signaling following neuronal activity, leading to the transcription of multiple genes involved in synaptic functions. It induces the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and other genes to regulate synaptic connections and excitability (Fu2020Essential). NPAS4 also modulates experience-dependent plasticity and learning by enhancing feedback inhibition within cortical circuits (Fu2020Essential).

In addition to its role in synaptic plasticity, NPAS4 is involved in DNA repair processes. It forms a complex with the NuA4-TIP60 chromatin modifier, which facilitates activity-dependent changes in neuronal transcriptomes and circuitry. This complex helps protect against age-dependent somatic mutations by recruiting DNA repair machinery to damaged regulatory elements (Pollina2023A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NPAS4 gene have been implicated in several neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Variants in NPAS4 are associated with intellectual disability (ID) and schizophrenia (SZ), as they disrupt the gene's transcriptional activity by preventing heterodimerization with the partner protein ARNT2. This disruption affects the excitatory/inhibitory balance in the brain, which is often altered in these conditions (Rossi2021Molecular). Specific NPAS4 variants, such as G59D, E99K, and R145H, are linked to ID and developmental delays, with the 170X variant showing a significant loss of function (Rossi2021Molecular).

NPAS4 is also involved in epilepsy, where it acts as a modulator of seizure activity and epileptogenesis. Its expression is upregulated in response to seizures, and its absence in knockout mice accelerates the development of kindling, a model of epilepsy. This suggests that NPAS4 plays a role in homeostatic scaling during epileptogenesis (Shan2017Neuronal). Additionally, NPAS4's interaction with IPAS influences neuronal cell survival and death, with alterations potentially affecting conditions related to neuronal apoptosis (Kasai2021Direct). These findings highlight the clinical significance of NPAS4 in various neurological disorders.

## Interactions
NPAS4 interacts with several proteins and forms complexes that are crucial for its function in neurons. It forms heterodimers with ARNT2, a neuron-specific homologue of ARNT, which is essential for its transcriptional activity. This interaction allows NPAS4 to bind to conserved DNA elements in the regulatory regions of target genes, influencing gene expression related to synaptic plasticity and neuroprotection (Bersten2014Human).

NPAS4 also interacts with IPAS, a transcriptional repressor and pro-apoptotic protein. This interaction is characterized by mutual inhibition, where IPAS represses NPAS4's transactivation activity, and NPAS4 attenuates IPAS's pro-apoptotic activity. This interaction is significant for neuronal cell survival, as NPAS4's protective role against neurotoxins is partly due to its ability to inhibit IPAS-induced apoptosis (Kasai2021Direct).

Additionally, NPAS4 is part of a complex with the NuA4 chromatin modifier, which is involved in DNA repair and transcriptional responses to neuronal activity. This complex helps maintain genome stability in neurons by coordinating gene transcription and DNA repair in response to synaptic activity (Pollina2023A).
