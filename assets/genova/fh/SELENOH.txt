# SELENOH

## Overview
SELENOH is a gene that encodes the protein selenoprotein H, a unique selenocysteine-containing protein primarily located in the nucleolus of human cells. Selenoprotein H is characterized by a thioredoxin fold and a CXXU motif, where 'U' represents selenocysteine, indicating its potential role in redox reactions. This protein is involved in maintaining redox homeostasis and protecting cells from oxidative stress by consuming reactive oxygen species (ROS). Its nucleolar localization and DNA binding ability, facilitated by a nuclear localization signal, allow it to interact with stress response elements and regulate genes involved in oxidative stress response. SELENOH's role in redox homeostasis and its interaction with the p53 pathway have implications in cancer treatment, where it is targeted to induce apoptosis in cancer cells (Metanis2023The; Dardashti2023The).

## Structure
Selenoprotein H (SELENOH) is a unique selenocysteine-containing protein located in the nucleolus of human cells. The primary structure of SELENOH includes a selenocysteine residue encoded by the UGA codon, which is typically a stop codon, complicating its recombinant expression (Metanis2023The; Dardashti2023The). SELENOH is predicted to have a thioredoxin fold, characterized by a CXXU motif, where 'U' represents selenocysteine. This motif is similar to the CXXC motif found in thioredoxins, indicating its role in redox reactions (Dardashti2023The; Cui2022Targeting).

The secondary structure of SELENOH is suggested to include an alpha-helix and a beta-sheet surrounding the CXXU motif, a conserved feature of thioredoxins (Dardashti2023The). This structural arrangement implies a potential role in catalyzing disulfide bond formation, isomerization, or destruction in other proteins (Dardashti2023The). SELENOH's nucleolar localization is attributed to a nuclear localization signal at its N-terminus, which forms electrostatic interactions with DNA, facilitating its unique DNA binding ability (Metanis2023The).

SELENOH is involved in DNA binding and reactive oxygen species consumption, contributing to redox homeostasis in the cell. Its ability to bind DNA fragments associated with stress response elements suggests a role in sensing reactive oxygen species and initiating protective gene expression (Metanis2023The; Dardashti2023The).

## Function
Selenoprotein H (SELENOH) is a unique selenocysteine-containing protein primarily located in the nucleolus of cells, where it plays a significant role in maintaining redox homeostasis and protecting against oxidative stress. SELENOH is involved in the consumption of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as peroxides, which can damage cellular components if not regulated. Suppressed expression of SELENOH leads to increased peroxide levels, while its overexpression helps protect cells from oxidative damage, indicating its critical role in antioxidant defense (Metanis2023The; Dardashti2023The).

SELENOH is predicted to have a thioredoxin fold and contains a CXXU motif, suggesting it may catalyze the formation, isomerization, or destruction of disulfide bonds in other proteins. However, studies on Sec-to-Cys mutants have not confirmed thioredoxin activity (Metanis2023The; Dardashti2023The). The protein's nucleolar localization and DNA binding ability are unique, facilitated by a nuclear localization signal at its N-terminus. This sequence can form electrostatic interactions with DNA's negatively charged backbone, similar to an AT-hook, allowing SELENOH to bind DNA promoters upstream of genes involved in stress responses, such as those producing glutathione, which further aids in ROS consumption (Metanis2023The; Dardashti2023The).

## Interactions
SELENOH, or selenoprotein H, is known for its unique nucleolar localization and ability to bind DNA. This protein contains a nuclear localization signal resembling an AT-hook, which allows it to interact with the minor groove of DNA. SELENOH has been shown to bind DNA fragments associated with stress response elements, suggesting a role in regulating genes involved in oxidative stress response (Metanis2023The; Dardashti2023The). 

SELENOH's interaction with DNA is linked to its potential function in sensing excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) and binding to DNA promoters upstream of genes like a-GCS, which initiates glutathione production to mitigate oxidative stress (Dardashti2023The). The protein's DNA binding ability is enhanced by its selenocysteine content, which may improve its interaction with DNA (Dardashti2023The).

In the context of cancer treatment, SELENOH has been identified as a target due to its role in tumor proliferation and interaction with the p53 pathway. The antibiotic carrimycin, specifically its component ISP I, can bind and inhibit SELENOH, leading to increased ROS in cancer cells and inducing apoptosis (Dardashti2023The).
