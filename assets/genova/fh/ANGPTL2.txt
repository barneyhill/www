# ANGPTL2

## Overview
ANGPTL2, or angiopoietin-like 2, is a gene that encodes a secreted glycoprotein involved in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. The protein, also referred to as ANGPTL2, is categorized as an adipokine due to its significant expression in adipose tissue and its role in regulating inflammation and energy metabolism (ThorinTrescases2017High). Structurally, ANGPTL2 contains an N-terminal coiled-coil domain and a C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain, which are essential for its function in promoting angiogenesis, inflammation, and hematopoietic stem cell survival (Broxmeyer2012Angiopoietinlike2; Farhat2014Cloning). The protein interacts with various cell surface receptors, such as integrins and LILRB2, to mediate its effects on cellular processes (Carbone2018AngiopoietinLike; ThorinTrescases2017High). Clinically, dysregulation of ANGPTL2 expression is linked to several diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and metabolic disorders, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Oike2015The; Gellen2016ANGPTL2).

## Structure
ANGPTL2 is a secreted glycoprotein with a molecular weight of approximately 57 kDa, which increases to 64 kDa when glycosylated (ThorinTrescases2017High). The primary structure of ANGPTL2 includes an N-terminal coiled-coil domain and a C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain, both of which are crucial for its function (Kubota2005Cooperative; Farhat2014Cloning). The coiled-coil domain is involved in protein-protein interactions and oligomerization, which are essential for its role in hematopoietic stem cell proliferation and survival (Broxmeyer2012Angiopoietinlike2). The fibrinogen-like domain is associated with angiogenic activities and acts as a ligand for integrins, such as α5β1, facilitating endothelial cell adhesion and monocyte chemotactic activities (Yang2021Emerging).

ANGPTL2 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which are critical for its biological activity. These modifications are necessary for the protein's functional activity, as demonstrated by the lack of functionality in bacterially expressed ANGPTL2 without these modifications (Farhat2014Cloning). The protein is cleaved in the extracellular space, resulting in fragments that retain functional domains, further influencing its interaction with receptors (Yang2021Emerging). The protein's structure and modifications are essential for its diverse roles in physiological and pathological processes.

## Function
ANGPTL2 (angiopoietin-like 2) is a glycoprotein involved in various physiological processes, including angiogenesis, inflammation, and energy metabolism. In healthy human cells, ANGPTL2 is known for its proangiogenic and antiapoptotic capacities, which are beneficial in certain physiological contexts such as stroke recovery. It plays a role in vasculogenesis and increases the survival and expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, suggesting its importance in maintaining vascular health and supporting blood cell regeneration (ThorinTrescases2017High).

ANGPTL2 is abundantly expressed in adipose tissues and is categorized as an adipokine, a protein secreted by adipocytes. It is associated with adiposity and systemic inflammation, with circulating levels correlating with body mass index (BMI), weight, and visceral fat in humans (ThorinTrescases2017High). In the heart, ANGPTL2 contributes to cardiac function by affecting ventricular contractility and myocardial energy metabolism (ThorinTrescases2017High).

The protein is active in the extracellular space, where it interacts with cell surface receptors such as integrin α5β1 and LILRB2, depending on the cell type, to mediate its effects (ThorinTrescases2017High). These interactions are crucial for its role in inflammation and metabolic processes, indicating its regulatory functions in these contexts.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ANGPTL2 gene are implicated in various diseases, primarily due to its role in promoting chronic inflammation and pathological tissue remodeling. Elevated ANGPTL2 levels are associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVD), as they reflect vascular inflammatory status and contribute to arteriosclerosis progression. This association is independent of other risk factors, highlighting ANGPTL2's potential as a biomarker for CVD (Oike2015The; Gellen2016ANGPTL2). In cancer, ANGPTL2 is involved in carcinogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. It is upregulated in response to tissue damage, leading to increased genomic instability by silencing DNA repair enzymes. In the tumor microenvironment, ANGPTL2 promotes tumor cell invasion and angiogenesis, with high expression levels correlating with poor clinical outcomes in various cancers, including papillary thyroid cancer and breast cancer (Yang2019Expression; Oike2015The; Endo2014Serum).

In metabolic disorders, ANGPTL2 is linked to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, where it promotes vascular damage by favoring macrophage accumulation and activation. Its expression is increased in obesity, contributing to chronic inflammation and insulin resistance (Oike2015The; Gellen2016ANGPTL2). ANGPTL2 is also associated with heart failure, where it disrupts cardiac function by inactivating the AKT-SERCA2a signaling pathway (Tian2016ANGPTL2). These findings suggest that ANGPTL2 could serve as a therapeutic target in managing these conditions.

## Interactions
ANGPTL2 interacts with various receptors and proteins, influencing multiple signaling pathways. It binds to integrin receptors, particularly integrin α5β1, in different cell types, including chondrocytes and renal tubule cells. This interaction promotes inflammation and fibrosis by activating signaling pathways such as MAPKs (ERK, JNK, p38), Akt, and NF-κB, which are crucial for the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the expression of inflammation-related genes (Takano2019ANGPTL2; Morinaga2016Angiopoietinlike).

In cardiomyocytes, ANGPTL2 inactivates the AKT-SERCA2a signaling pathway, affecting cardiac function and energy metabolism. This interaction is mediated by integrin β1, as its knockdown prevents ANGPTL2 from downregulating AKT-dependent SERCA2a protein levels (Tian2016ANGPTL2).

ANGPTL2 also interacts with the immune-inhibitory receptor LILRB2 in certain cancer cells, contributing to processes like epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and resistance to chemotherapy (Carbone2018AngiopoietinLike). In adipocytes, ANGPTL2 binds to CD146, a newly identified receptor, indicating its diverse receptor interactions across different tissues (ThorinTrescases2021Angptl2). These interactions highlight ANGPTL2's role in modulating cellular responses in various physiological and pathological contexts.
