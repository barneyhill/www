# NWD2

## Overview
NWD2 is a gene that encodes the protein NACHT and WD repeat domain containing 2, which is involved in various cellular processes. The protein is characterized by the presence of a NACHT domain, which is known for its role in mediating protein-protein interactions, and WD repeat domains, which are typically involved in the formation of protein complexes. These structural features suggest that the NWD2 protein may function as a scaffold or regulatory protein, potentially playing a role in signal transduction pathways or cellular stress responses. The precise biological functions and mechanisms of action of NWD2 remain an active area of research, with ongoing studies aiming to elucidate its role in health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
