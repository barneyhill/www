# TMC1

## Overview
The TMC1 gene encodes the transmembrane channel-like protein 1, which is integral to the auditory mechanotransduction process in the inner ear. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane channel and is primarily expressed in the hair cells of the cochlea, where it plays a pivotal role in converting mechanical stimuli from sound waves into electrical signals. Structurally, TMC1 is a dimeric protein with ten transmembrane helices per protomer, forming a channel that facilitates ion flow, particularly calcium ions, essential for auditory signal transduction (Corey2018Function; Ballesteros2018Structural). The protein's function is critical for maintaining the mechanical properties of the cochlea, and mutations in the TMC1 gene are linked to various forms of hearing loss, underscoring its clinical significance (Marcovich2020Evolution; Kurima2002Dominant).

## Structure
The TMC1 protein is characterized by its complex molecular structure, which plays a crucial role in auditory mechanosensory transduction. It is a dimeric protein with a two-fold axis of rotational symmetry, consisting of ten transmembrane helices per protomer (Jeong2022Structures; Ballesteros2018Structural). The transmembrane domains form a cavity that is suggested to be an ion permeation pathway, with helices TM4-TM7 contributing to its structure (Ballesteros2018Structural). The protein's structure is similar to that of TMEM16 proteins, indicating a common fold and function as a pore-forming subunit (Ballesteros2018Structural).

The TMC1 complex includes auxiliary subunits such as CALM-1 and TMIE, which interact with the TMC1 protomers and the membrane, forming a structure that resembles an accordion (Jeong2022Structure). The cytosolic domain contains six helices oriented parallel to the membrane, with amphipathic helices H3 and H4 forming hydrophobic contacts with the inner leaflet (Jeong2022Structures). The protein is also subject to post-translational modifications and exists in different splice variant isoforms, which may influence its function and localization (Labay2010Topology).

## Function
The TMC1 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the mechanotransduction process in the inner ear, essential for hearing. TMC1 is expressed in the hair cells of the cochlea, where it functions as a component of ion channels that convert mechanical stimuli from sound waves into electrical signals (Marcovich2020Evolution; Corey2018Function). The protein is localized at the tips of stereocilia, the site of hair cell transduction, and is involved in forming mechanosensory channels that facilitate ion flow, particularly calcium ions, which are crucial for auditory signal transduction (Marcovich2020Evolution; Ballesteros2018Structural).

TMC1 is predicted to form a dimeric channel with ten transmembrane domains, similar to the TMEM16 family of ion channels, and is involved in cation permeability (Corey2018Function). The presence of negatively charged residues in TMC1 is thought to attract cations, enhancing conductivity, while positively charged residues may inhibit it (Corey2018Function). The protein's structure and function are crucial for maintaining the mechanical properties of the cochlea and ensuring proper auditory transduction, with mutations in TMC1 leading to hearing loss (Corey2018Function; Marcovich2020Evolution).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TMC1 gene are associated with both autosomal dominant and recessive forms of nonsyndromic hearing loss. The dominant form, linked to the DFNA36 locus, typically results in postlingual progressive hearing loss, particularly affecting high frequencies (Cho2023Novel; Kurima2002Dominant). A specific missense mutation, D572N, is suggested to act through a dominant-negative or gain-of-function mechanism (Kurima2002Dominant). In contrast, the recessive form, associated with the DFNB7/B11 locus, often leads to congenital severe-to-profound hearing loss (Nishio2021Prevalence; Kurima2002Dominant).

TMC1 mutations are a common cause of autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL) in various populations, with significant prevalence rates reported in countries such as Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey (Sadeghian2019Nextgeneration). In some ethnic groups, such as the Moroccan Jewish population, the prevalence is as high as 38% (Sadeghian2019Nextgeneration). The TMC1 gene encodes a protein essential for mechano-electrical transduction in cochlear hair cells, and mutations can disrupt this function, leading to hearing impairment (Wang2018Identification). The lack of vestibular dysfunction in TMC1 mutant phenotypes suggests possible functional redundancy with other genes like TMC2 in the vestibular system (Kurima2002Dominant).

## Interactions
TMC1 interacts with several proteins that are crucial for its function in mechanotransduction in cochlear hair cells. One significant interaction is with LHFPL5, a protein that stabilizes TMC1. This interaction is essential for maintaining TMC1 expression levels in cochlear hair cells. Mutations such as D572N in TMC1 disrupt this binding, leading to destabilization of TMC1 and contributing to deafness (Yu2020Deafness). The interaction between TMC1 and LHFPL5 has been demonstrated using various assays, including co-immunoprecipitation and microbead-based SiMPull (Yu2020Deafness).

TMC1 is also part of a larger mechanosensory transduction complex that includes proteins such as TMIE and CALM-1. These proteins interact with TMC1 to form a multiprotein complex involved in the conversion of mechanical stimuli into electrical signals in hair cells. CALM-1 interacts with the cytosolic face of TMC1, while TMIE is positioned peripherally within the complex (Jeong2022Structures). These interactions are crucial for the proper assembly and function of the mechanotransduction channel complex.
