# HEPH

## Overview
The HEPH gene encodes the protein hephaestin, a transmembrane multi-copper ferroxidase that plays a pivotal role in iron metabolism. Hephaestin is primarily involved in the oxidation of ferrous iron (Fe²⁺) to ferric iron (Fe³⁺), facilitating its binding to transferrin for transport in the bloodstream. This process is crucial for the export of iron from intestinal epithelial cells, particularly in the duodenum, where hephaestin is predominantly active. The protein's structure is characterized by a C-terminal transmembrane domain and copper-binding sites, which are essential for its enzymatic activity. Hephaestin's interactions with other proteins, such as ferroportin and apo-transferrin, further underscore its role in maintaining systemic iron homeostasis. Mutations or dysregulation of the HEPH gene can lead to iron-related disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in conditions like anemia and neurodegenerative diseases (Vulpe1999Hephaestin; Helman2022The; Zhao2015CpHeph).

## Structure
Hephaestin (HEPH) is a transmembrane protein with a complex molecular structure that plays a crucial role in iron metabolism. The primary structure of HEPH consists of 1158 amino acids, with a high degree of sequence identity to its murine counterpart (~85%) and approximately 50% identity with human ceruloplasmin (Syed2002Analysis; Petrak2005Hephaestin—a). The protein includes a C-terminal transmembrane domain, distinguishing it from the soluble ceruloplasmin, and an additional 86 amino acids at the C-terminus (Hudson2010Human; Petrak2005Hephaestin—a).

The secondary and tertiary structures of HEPH are modeled based on the crystal structure of ceruloplasmin, indicating a similar beta-barrel fold and conserved copper-binding sites (Syed2002Analysis). The protein's structure includes six domains, with specific residues coordinating copper ions and an iron-binding site surrounded by negatively charged residues (Syed2002Analysis).

HEPH undergoes post-translational modifications, such as N-glycosylation, which likely contribute to its apparent molecular mass of 150-160 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Petrak2005Hephaestin—a). The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the small intestine, brain, and placenta, and is localized to the supranuclear region of duodenal endothelial cells (Syed2002Analysis; Anderson2002The).

## Function
Hephaestin (HEPH) is a multi-copper ferroxidase that plays a critical role in iron metabolism, particularly in the small intestine. It facilitates the conversion of ferrous iron (Fe²⁺) to ferric iron (Fe³⁺), a necessary step for iron to bind to transferrin, the major plasma iron transport protein. This oxidation process is crucial for the export of iron from intestinal epithelial cells into the bloodstream via the iron export protein ferroportin (FPN) (Zoller2003Duodenal; Helman2022The). HEPH is predominantly active at the basolateral membrane of enterocytes in the duodenum, where it enhances the efficiency of FPN-mediated iron export (Helman2022The).

In healthy human cells, HEPH is essential for maintaining systemic iron homeostasis by ensuring efficient dietary iron absorption. Its absence or dysfunction can lead to reduced iron absorption and mild anemia, as observed in studies with mice (Helman2022The). Although primarily associated with the basolateral membrane, HEPH may also be located in an intracellular compartment close to the membrane, suggesting a potential role in intracellular iron management (Helman2022The). HEPH's activity is not limiting when dietary iron absorption is stimulated by iron deficiency, indicating the presence of other compensatory ferroxidase activities (Helman2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the HEPH gene are associated with several iron-related disorders. In the sex-linked anemia (sla) mouse model, a mutation in the HEPH gene leads to impaired intestinal iron transport, resulting in microcytic hypochromic anemia due to iron accumulation in enterocytes and reduced iron absorption into the bloodstream (Vulpe1999Hephaestin). This model highlights the critical role of hephaestin in iron egress from intestinal cells, linking copper and iron metabolism.

In humans, altered expression of HEPH is observed in conditions like iron deficiency and hereditary hemochromatosis (HH). Patients with iron deficiency show increased HEPH expression, while those with HH exhibit reduced expression, suggesting a compensatory mechanism in response to iron levels (Zoller2003Duodenal). 

Additionally, combined mutations in HEPH and ceruloplasmin (Cp) in mice lead to accelerated brain iron accumulation, resulting in neurodegeneration and motor dysfunction, conditions that are relevant to neurodegenerative diseases such as aceruloplasminemia (Zhao2015CpHeph). These findings underscore the importance of HEPH in maintaining iron homeostasis and its potential involvement in various iron metabolism disorders.

## Interactions
Hephaestin (HEPH) is involved in several key protein interactions that facilitate iron metabolism. It interacts with ferroportin (Fpn), a transmembrane protein essential for iron export. This interaction is crucial for the stabilization of Fpn in the plasma membrane, enabling the conversion of ferrous iron (Fe2+) to ferric iron (Fe3+) for transport by transferrin (Yeh2011Interactions; Baringer2023Apo). The interaction between HEPH and Fpn has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis, indicating a close physical association at the plasma membrane (Yeh2011Interactions; Dlouhy2019Fluorescence).

HEPH also interacts with apo-transferrin (apo-Tf), which facilitates iron release by accepting ferric iron oxidized by HEPH. This interaction is not disrupted by hepcidin, a hormone that regulates iron homeostasis, highlighting a differential mechanism of iron release regulation compared to holo-transferrin (holo-Tf), which interacts with Fpn (Baringer2023Apo). These interactions underscore HEPH's role in maintaining iron homeostasis, particularly in barrier cells such as endothelial cells and enterocytes (Baringer2023Apo).
