# C7orf25

## Overview
C7orf25 is a gene located on chromosome 7 that encodes the UPF0415 protein, which is characterized by the presence of a DUF1308 domain. This protein is predicted to be ubiquitously expressed across various human cell types, with its expression levels differing by cell type. The UPF0415 protein is primarily localized intracellularly, exhibiting moderate to strong nuclear and occasional cytoplasmic presence. It is involved in several cellular processes, including ATP-dependent protein breakdown in the proteasome pathway and protein activation, suggesting a role in protein metabolism. Despite its involvement in these processes, the specific biological functions and molecular activities of C7orf25 remain to be fully elucidated. The protein does not possess trans-membrane regions or signal peptides, indicating it is not membrane-bound or secreted under normal conditions (Zhang2022Integrated; Khowal2018Assessment).

## Structure


## Function
The C7orf25 gene encodes the UPF0415 protein, which is predicted to be ubiquitously expressed in normal human cells, with expression levels varying by cell type (Khowal2018Assessment). The protein is characterized by the presence of a DUF1308 domain, although the specific functional attributes of this domain remain unknown (Khowal2018Assessment). The UPF0415 protein is predicted to localize intracellularly, showing moderate to strong nuclear and occasional cytoplasmic positivity (Khowal2018Assessment).

In terms of molecular processes, C7orf25 has been associated with ATP-dependent protein breakdown in the proteasome pathway and protein activation, suggesting a role in protein metabolism (Zhang2022Integrated). The protein lacks trans-membrane regions and signal peptides, indicating it does not function as a membrane-bound or secreted protein under normal conditions (Khowal2018Assessment).

C7orf25 has been implicated in various cellular processes, including cellular growth, proliferation, assembly, organization, molecular transport, lipid metabolism, cell cycle, and cell death (Häbig2009Microarray). Despite these associations, the precise biological functions and molecular activities of C7orf25 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
C7orf25 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels and interactions. The gene is associated with cancer, particularly in the context of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The UPF0415 protein encoded by C7orf25 is upregulated in LGR5 knockdown brain cancer, suggesting a potential link to cancer progression (Khowal2018Assessment). Additionally, a novel isoform of the UPF0415 protein with secretory potential has been observed, which may play a role in cancer pathology (Khowal2018Assessment).

In the context of COVID-19, C7orf25 has been identified as one of the top probes associated with severe cases, indicating its involvement in immune response pathways critical for inflammation and antiviral immunity (Liu2021Mendelian). The gene is also part of a suggestive association region for sarcoidosis susceptibility, although its biological relevance to the disease remains unclear (Adrianto2012GenomeWide).

C7orf25 is involved in unfavorable prognosis in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and is associated with RNA metabolism and gene expression, potentially affecting carcinogenesis through the ribosomal pathway (Zhang2022Integrated). These findings highlight the gene's potential clinical significance in various diseases.
