# CARMIL2

## Overview
CARMIL2 is a gene that encodes the protein capping protein regulator and myosin 1 linker 2, which is integral to the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. This protein is categorized as a cytoskeletal regulator and is involved in various cellular processes, including cell movement, shape maintenance, and immune function. CARMIL2 plays a pivotal role in T-cell activation and proliferation by mediating CD28 co-signaling, which is essential for the activation of the NF-kB pathway, a critical component of immune responses (Schober2017A). The protein's structure includes several domains, such as a pleckstrin-homology domain, leucine-rich repeat domain, and a capping protein-binding region, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and cellular structures (Lanier2015CARMIL2; Stark2017CARMIL). Mutations in the CARMIL2 gene are linked to primary immunodeficiency disorders, highlighting its importance in immune system function and cellular dynamics (Zhu2023Case; Kolukisa2021Evolution).

## Structure
CARMIL2 is a multidomain protein involved in actin cytoskeleton regulation. Its molecular structure includes several distinct domains. The N-terminus features a noncanonical pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain, which lacks the conserved residues necessary for phospholipid binding, distinguishing it from CARMIL1 (Stark2017CARMIL). Following the PH domain is a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, which is crucial for localization to vimentin intermediate filaments and consists of 16 leucine-rich repeats (Lanier2015CARMIL2). The LRR domain forms a horseshoe shape with α-helices on the convex surface and β-strands on the concave surface (Stark2017CARMIL).

The central region of CARMIL2 includes a helical dimerization (HD) domain, which facilitates the formation of homodimers (Stark2017CARMIL). The C-terminal half of the protein contains an extended intrinsically disordered region, which includes a capping protein-binding region (CBR) with conserved capping protein interaction (CPI) and CARMIL-specific interaction (CSI) motifs (Stark2017CARMIL). This region also features a membrane-binding domain (MBD) composed of basic and hydrophobic residues, essential for membrane localization and function in cell migration (Lanier2016Cell). The protein's structure is further characterized by a proline-rich domain (PRD) (Stark2017CARMIL). Specific post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
CARMIL2, also known as capping protein regulator and myosin 1 linker 2, plays a crucial role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for various cellular processes such as cell movement, shape, and immune function. In healthy human cells, CARMIL2 is involved in CD28-mediated co-signalling, which is vital for T-cell activation, proliferation, and effector function. This process is crucial for the activation of the canonical NF-kB pathway, a key component of immune responses (Schober2017A).

CARMIL2 contributes to the stabilization of activated PKCy-microclusters at the immunological synapse, linking CD28 co-signalling to NF-kB activation. It is also important for the development of regulatory T cells and affects cytoskeletal dynamics, influencing T-cell migration and polarity (Schober2017A). The protein interacts with vimentin intermediate filaments and membrane-associated actin networks, impacting cell migration and matrix degradation (Zhu2023Case).

CARMIL2's membrane-binding domain is essential for its localization to leading-edge lamellipodia, ruffles, and macropinosomes, which are critical for cell migration and invadopodia formation. This domain interacts with membrane lipids, facilitating actin assembly and cell motility (Lanier2016Cell). CARMIL2's role in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining cell polarity and directed migration, which are vital for effective immune responses (Schober2017A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CARMIL2 gene are associated with a rare autosomal recessive primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by impaired T-cell activation, proliferation, differentiation, and migration. This deficiency leads to a range of clinical manifestations, including recurrent infections, particularly respiratory infections, and various skin conditions such as eczematous dermatitis, psoriatic rash, and skin warts (Zhu2023Case; Kolukisa2021Evolution). Patients with CARMIL2 deficiency may also experience inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), failure to thrive, and are at risk for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-related smooth muscle tumors (Bosa2021Novel; Schober2017A).

The deficiency is linked to impaired CD28-mediated co-signaling in T cells, despite normal TCR signaling and CD28 surface expression, leading to compromised peripheral T-cell immunity (Schober2017A). CARMIL2 mutations can also result in reduced proportions of memory CD4+ T cells, regulatory T cells, and circulating T follicular helper cells, along with decreased memory B and NK cells (Kolukisa2021Evolution). The condition is associated with a lack of regulatory T cells in peripheral blood, although this does not lead to immune dysregulation due to impaired effector T-cell responses (Schober2017A).

CARMIL2 deficiency can manifest as isolated IBD, with some patients experiencing a later onset of symptoms, and is associated with autoimmune endocrinopathies and autoimmune disorders (Bosa2021Novel). The gene's role in T-cell signaling and its impact on immune surveillance, particularly against EBV-infected cells, underscores its clinical significance (Schober2017A).

## Interactions
CARMIL2 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in actin cytoskeleton regulation and immune cell signaling. It binds to capping protein (CP), inhibiting its barbed end capping activity, which is essential for actin polymerization. This interaction occurs through a CP-binding motif within CARMIL2, which adopts a loopy structure upon binding, suggesting an allosteric inhibition mechanism (Takeda2011Actin). CARMIL2 also co-localizes with the vimentin intermediate filament network, linking it to dynamic actin assembly and influencing cell morphology and migration (Edwards2014Capping).

CARMIL2 is involved in T-cell activation by stabilizing PKCy-microclusters at the immunological synapse, linking CD28 co-signaling to the NF-kB pathway (Schober2017A). It acts as a scaffold that connects CD28 to the CARD11/CARMA1 cytosolic adaptor, facilitating NF-κB signaling, which is crucial for T-cell activation and proliferation (Bosa2021Novel). The protein's interactions with cytoskeletal components and its role in immune signaling highlight its importance in cellular processes such as motility and immune response (Lanier2016Cell). These interactions underscore CARMIL2's multifaceted role in cellular dynamics and immune function.
