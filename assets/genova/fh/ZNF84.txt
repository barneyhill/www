# ZNF84

## Overview
ZNF84 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 84, a member of the KRAB/FPB subfamily of zinc finger proteins. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger domains and KRAB/FPB modules, which are integral to its function as a transcriptional regulator. Zinc finger protein 84 primarily acts as a transcriptional repressor, influencing gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. It plays a significant role in regulating the CDKN1A gene, which is crucial for cell cycle arrest and senescence, particularly in the absence of p53 (Rosati2001Assignment; StrzeszewskaPotyrała2021ChromatinDirected). The gene's expression is widespread in human tissues, and its protein product is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it contributes to maintaining genomic stability and regulating cell cycle progression (StrzeszewskaPotyrała2021ChromatinDirected). ZNF84's involvement in cancer biology, particularly its over-expression in certain cancers and its interaction with key signaling pathways, underscores its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2018Increased).

## Structure
The ZNF84 gene encodes a zinc finger protein that is part of the KRAB/FPB subfamily, characterized by the presence of zinc finger domains and KRAB/FPB modules. The primary structure of ZNF84 includes sequences that encode the KRAB/FPB-A and KRAB/FPB-B modules, as well as an array of zinc finger motifs, which are typical features of transcriptional regulators (Rosati2001Assignment). These zinc finger motifs facilitate DNA binding, playing a crucial role in the protein's function as a transcriptional repressor.

The gene is organized into four exons, with two exons specifically encoding the KRAB/FPB modules and the remaining exons encoding the N-terminal amino acids and C-terminal zinc finger units (Li2018Increased). This exon organization is conserved among the KRAB/FPB-ZFP family, suggesting a common evolutionary origin through exon recruitment (Rosati2001Assignment).

While specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of ZNF84 are not provided, the presence of zinc finger domains suggests a structure stabilized by zinc ion coordination, which is typical for proteins in this family. The study of ZNF84's molecular structure and its splice variants remains an area for further research.

## Function
ZNF84 is a zinc finger protein that functions primarily as a transcriptional regulator in human cells. It is part of the KRAB/FPB-ZFP family, which is known for its role in transcriptional repression. The protein contains KRAB/FPB domains that are crucial for this repressive function, suggesting that ZNF84 acts as a negative transcriptional regulator (Rosati2001Assignment). ZNF84 is involved in the regulation of the CDKN1A gene, which encodes the p21 protein, a key player in cell cycle arrest and senescence. This regulation occurs independently of p53, indicating that ZNF84 provides an alternative pathway for p21 expression in the absence of p53 (StrzeszewskaPotyrała2021ChromatinDirected).

In healthy human cells, ZNF84 is widely expressed, with minimal exon skipping, indicating that the full-length protein is active across various tissues (Rosati2001Assignment). The protein is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences the transcriptional landscape by binding to specific DNA sequences. This activity is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and regulating cell cycle progression, particularly under conditions of genotoxic stress (StrzeszewskaPotyrała2021ChromatinDirected). The conservation of its intron/exon organization with other KRAB/FPB-ZFP genes suggests a shared evolutionary origin and functional similarities within this gene family (Rosati2001Assignment).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF84 has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In cervical cancer, ZNF84 is significantly over-expressed, with a positive rate of 80% in cancerous tissues compared to no expression in normal tissues. This over-expression is associated with larger tumor sizes and advanced TNM staging in squamous cell carcinoma, suggesting a role in cancer progression. The gene's interaction with the Akt signaling pathway is notable, as down-regulation of ZNF84 leads to decreased Akt expression and reduced cancer cell proliferation, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2018Increased).

In colon cancer, ZNF84 expression levels have been linked to patient survival. Lower expression correlates with increased survival, suggesting that ZNF84 may influence cancer prognosis and therapy response. The gene regulates p21 expression independently of p53, affecting cell cycle regulation and senescence, which are critical in cancer progression and treatment resistance (StrzeszewskaPotyrała2021ChromatinDirected).

ZNF84 is also located in a genomic region associated with recurrent breakpoints and allelic loss in several cancers, indicating its potential involvement in cancer-related genomic instability (Rosati2001Assignment). These findings highlight ZNF84's clinical significance in cancer biology and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
ZNF84 is a zinc finger protein that interacts with DNA and other proteins to regulate gene expression. It has been identified as a chromatin-bound protein at the CDKN1A promoter, suggesting its role as a transcription factor in regulating the expression of the CDKN1A gene, which encodes the p21 protein. This interaction is particularly significant in p53-deficient cancer cells undergoing genotoxic stress, such as chemotherapy (StrzeszewskaPotyrała2021ChromatinDirected).

ZNF84 is also involved in the regulation of the cell cycle and stress response pathways. Its down-regulation leads to changes in gene expression, including the activation of MYC oncogene pathways and metabolic shifts, indicating a complex interaction network even in the absence of p53 (StrzeszewskaPotyrała2021ChromatinDirected). ZNF84's role in maintaining cell cycle arrest and genomic stability is suggested by its influence on cell cycle regulators like p21, although specific protein interactions are not detailed (StrzeszewskaPotyrała2021ChromatinDirected).

In addition to its role in transcriptional regulation, ZNF84 is part of the KRAB zinc finger protein family, which is known for repressing transposable elements by recruiting KAP1 and associated effectors (Helleboid2019The). However, specific interactions of ZNF84 with KAP1 or other proteins in this context are not detailed beyond its association with certain retrotransposon integrants (Helleboid2019The).
