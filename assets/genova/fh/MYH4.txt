# MYH4

## Overview
The MYH4 gene encodes the myosin heavy chain 4 protein, a crucial component of the myosin complex involved in muscle contraction. This protein is predominantly expressed in fast-twitch skeletal muscle fibers, which are responsible for rapid and forceful movements. As a member of the myosin heavy chain family, myosin heavy chain 4 plays a vital role in the actomyosin interaction necessary for muscle contraction, particularly in type IIb muscle fibers. These fibers are characterized by their ability to generate high force and speed, making them essential for activities requiring quick bursts of strength. The expression and regulation of MYH4 are intricately controlled by various genetic and epigenetic factors, including chromatin interactions and transcriptional regulators, which are crucial for muscle differentiation and function (Long2022Identification; Schiaffino2018Muscle; Uhlířová2021Nucleoporin). Understanding the role of MYH4 is significant for insights into muscle physiology and potential muscle-related disorders.

## Structure
The MYH4 gene encodes the myosin heavy chain 4 protein, which is primarily expressed in fast-twitch skeletal muscle fibers. The primary structure of MYH4 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the myosin heavy chain. This protein is involved in muscle contraction and is characterized by specific domains crucial for its function, including the catalytic domain. This domain is essential for actomyosin interaction and contains binding sites for phosphate, ATP, and ADP, as well as actin-binding locations (Lindqvist2013The).

The secondary structure of MYH4 includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices and sheets into a three-dimensional shape, allowing the protein to perform its role in muscle contraction effectively. The quaternary structure of MYH4 involves the assembly of myosin heavy chains with light chains to form a functional myosin molecule (Ma2018Myosin).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur in MYH4, affecting its function and the regulation of muscle contraction. These modifications can influence the protein's interaction with other molecules and its overall activity in muscle fibers (Ma2018Myosin).

## Function
MYH4 encodes the myosin heavy chain 4 protein, which is a critical component of type IIb myosin found in skeletal muscle fibers. This protein plays a significant role in muscle contraction by interacting with actin filaments, facilitating rapid and forceful movements. MYH4 is primarily active in fast-twitch muscle fibers, which are responsible for quick, powerful muscle actions. These fibers are characterized by their ability to generate high force and speed, making them essential for activities that require sudden bursts of strength or speed, such as sprinting or weightlifting (Schiaffino2018Muscle).

In humans, MYH4 is expressed in trace amounts in leg muscle samples, indicating its limited presence compared to other myosin heavy chain isoforms. The protein's function is closely tied to its role in muscle fiber type diversity and plasticity, as it is involved in the signaling pathways that control myosin gene expression. The presence of MYH4 in muscle fibers contributes to the overall functional properties of the muscle, including its speed of contraction and resistance to fatigue (Schiaffino2018Muscle).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the MYH4 gene can have significant clinical implications, particularly in muscle-related conditions. The MYH4 gene encodes a myosin heavy chain protein that is crucial for the formation of fast-twitch, glycolytic IIB muscle fibers. These fibers are essential for muscle mass and function, and their absence can lead to muscle fiber loss and impaired muscle development (Zeng2022Driving). In Myh4 knockout mice, the lack of IIB fibers results in a compensatory increase in other fiber types, such as type I, IIA, and IIX fibers, but this does not fully compensate for the loss of muscle mass and fiber number (Zeng2022Driving).

The deletion of a fast myosin super enhancer (fMyh-SE), which regulates MYH4 and other myosin genes, leads to impaired muscle function and can result in death at birth due to the inability to breathe, underscoring the enhancer's importance in muscle development (Dos2022A). The absence of MYH4 expression due to such genetic alterations can contribute to muscle fiber phenotype changes and sarcomere formation issues, potentially impacting muscle integrity and function (Dos2022A). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of MYH4 in understanding and addressing muscle-related diseases and conditions.

## Interactions
MYH4, or myosin heavy chain 4, is involved in various interactions that are crucial for muscle function and differentiation. It is part of a complex regulatory network that includes interactions with chromatin and transcription factors. In skeletal muscle, MYH4 expression is regulated by chromatin interactions, particularly with a 38 kb intergenic region that shows strong interactions with the promoters of fast Myh genes, such as Myh4, in the quadriceps muscle (Long2022Identification).

The nucleoporin TPR plays a significant role in regulating MYH4 expression during myogenic differentiation. TPR forms a complex with the histone demethylase LSD1, targeting it to genes associated with muscle differentiation, including MYH4. This interaction is crucial for the proper expression of MYH4, as TPR depletion leads to decreased MYH4 expression in differentiated myotubes (Uhlířová2021Nucleoporin). TPR and LSD1 binding to MYH4 is more prominent in myoblasts, suggesting a poised state for rapid expression upon differentiation (Uhlířová2021Nucleoporin).

These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms involving MYH4, which are essential for muscle development and function. The regulation of MYH4 by TPR and LSD1 underscores the importance of chromatin organization and transcriptional regulation in muscle differentiation.
