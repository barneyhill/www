# FAM234B

## Overview
FAM234B is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 234, member B. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. FAM234B has been categorized as a protein of interest due to its potential involvement in signaling pathways and cellular interactions. The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to significant clinical implications, particularly in luminal breast cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders. In luminal breast cancer, FAM234B overexpression correlates with poor prognosis, suggesting its utility as a prognostic marker (Overexpression; Lyu2020&lt; p&gt). Additionally, genetic studies have identified FAM234B as a candidate gene in neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its potential role in these conditions (Cardoso2019Essential). Further research is necessary to explore the full spectrum of FAM234B's functions and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The FAM234B gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its altered expression or mutations. In luminal breast cancer, overexpression of FAM234B is associated with poor prognosis. This overexpression is linked to higher mRNA levels in luminal breast cancer tissues compared to normal tissues and other breast cancer subtypes. It is particularly associated with worse overall survival in patients with luminal A and B subtypes, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker in these cancers (Overexpression; Lyu2020&lt; p&gt).

In the context of neurodevelopmental disorders, FAM234B has been identified as a candidate gene through whole exome sequencing in consanguineous families. Mutations in FAM234B, such as homozygous truncating variants, have been found in patients, indicating its potential role in neurodevelopmental disorders (Reuter2017Diagnostic; Cardoso2019Essential).

These findings highlight the significance of FAM234B in disease mechanisms, particularly in luminal breast cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders, where its expression and genetic alterations may contribute to disease progression and prognosis. Further research is needed to fully understand its role and potential as a therapeutic target.
