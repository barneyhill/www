# GRM8

## Overview
GRM8 is a gene that encodes the glutamate metabotropic receptor 8 (mGluR8), a member of the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family, specifically classified as a metabotropic glutamate receptor. This receptor is integral to the modulation of neurotransmission within the central nervous system, primarily through the inhibition of the cyclic AMP cascade and regulation of presynaptic glutamate release. The receptor's structure is characterized by a large extracellular domain with a Venus fly trap (VFT) domain for ligand binding, seven transmembrane helices, and an intracellular C-terminal tail, which facilitates interactions with cytosolic proteins to regulate receptor functions (Lüffe2022LossofFunction; Enz2012Metabotropic). GRM8 is involved in maintaining synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory, and its dysfunction has been associated with various psychiatric and neurological disorders, including schizophrenia and autism (Oka2023RareCRHR2andGRM8variants; Serajee2003The). The gene's alternative splicing results in multiple isoforms, which may influence the receptor's pharmacological and functional roles in the brain (Malherbe1999Cloning).

## Structure
The GRM8 gene encodes the glutamate metabotropic receptor 8, a member of the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This receptor is characterized by a large extracellular domain that includes an agonist-binding Venus fly trap (VFT) domain, which is crucial for ligand binding (Lüffe2022LossofFunction). The receptor structure also features seven transmembrane helices that form the core structure, typical of GPCRs, and an intracellular C-terminal tail that interacts with cytosolic proteins to regulate receptor functions (Enz2012Metabotropic).

The C-terminal domain is intrinsically disordered but can adopt ordered conformations upon interaction with binding partners, allowing for diverse signaling pathways (Enz2012Metabotropic). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation are common, contributing to the receptor's functional regulation (Enz2012Metabotropic).

Alternative splicing of the GRM8 gene results in different isoforms, including mGluR8a, mGluR8b, and mGluR8c. These variants differ in their C-terminal regions, with HmGluR8b having a substitution of the last 16 amino acids and HmGluR8c being a truncated protein that may represent a secreted isoform (Malherbe1999Cloning). These structural variations can influence the receptor's pharmacological profiles and functional roles in the brain (Malherbe1999Cloning).

## Function
GRM8 encodes the metabotropic glutamate receptor 8 (mGluR8), a G-protein coupled receptor that plays a crucial role in modulating neurotransmission in the central nervous system. This receptor is primarily involved in the inhibition of the cyclic AMP cascade and regulates presynaptic glutamate release, which is essential for maintaining synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory (Oka2023RareCRHR2andGRM8variants; Serajee2003The). GRM8 is part of the class C family of GPCRs and is active in the presynaptic terminals of neurons, where it influences neuronal excitability and signaling pathways (Oka2023RareCRHR2andGRM8variants).

The receptor is localized at the presynaptic grid of glutamate synapses, where it modulates glutamatergic transmission by inhibiting the release of glutamate at the synapse (Takaki2004Positive). This modulation is crucial for normal brain function, as it helps regulate excitatory neurotransmission and maintain the balance of synaptic signaling. The GRM8 gene has been associated with various psychiatric and neurological conditions, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal glutamatergic signaling and its potential role in the pathogenesis of disorders such as schizophrenia (Takaki2004Positive).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GRM8 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In squamous cell lung cancer (LUSC), the A112G mutation in GRM8 is associated with increased cell proliferation by inhibiting the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway and activating the MAPK pathway, which promotes cancer progression. This mutation is present in a significant portion of LUSC cases and suggests potential therapeutic targets, such as cAMP activators and MEK inhibitors, to inhibit tumor growth (Zhang2019Genomic).

In the context of psychiatric disorders, increased CpG methylation of the GRM8 gene has been linked to psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia and methamphetamine-induced psychotic disorder. This epigenetic alteration correlates with symptom severity and remission, indicating GRM8's role in the pathophysiology of these conditions (Dong2024Psychotic).

Additionally, GRM8 has been associated with autism, with studies suggesting that single nucleotide polymorphisms in the gene may contribute to autism susceptibility through alterations in glutamate receptor function (Serajee2003The). A de novo microdeletion involving GRM8 has also been linked to severe intellectual disability and autism characteristics, highlighting its potential role in neurodevelopmental disorders (Sangu2017A).

## Interactions
GRM8, or glutamate metabotropic receptor 8, is a G-protein coupled receptor that participates in various protein interactions crucial for its function in neurotransmission. GRM8 is involved in forming macromolecular signal complexes at synapses, interacting with proteins such as α-Actinin, Microtubule associated protein 1B, Tubulin, Homer, and Band 4.1 proteins. These interactions are essential for the formation and regulation of synaptic signaling complexes, which are potential targets for therapeutic interventions (Enz2012Metabotropic).

The receptor is also known to interact with scaffold proteins, which play a significant role in organizing these interactions by forming macromolecular signaling complexes that regulate mGluR-mediated signal transduction (Enz2012Metabotropic). GRM8 can form dimers with other metabotropic glutamate receptors, which may influence synaptic activity and neurotransmission (Nabit2024Thalamocortical).

Additionally, GRM8's interactions with proteins containing PDZ domains, such as Homer proteins, enhance mGluR-stimulated calcium signaling, which is crucial for various signaling pathways (Fonin2019Multifunctionality). These interactions highlight the receptor's role in modulating synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability, contributing to its involvement in neuropsychiatric disorders.
