# ALDOA

## Overview
The ALDOA gene encodes the enzyme aldolase, fructose-bisphosphate A, which is a critical component of the glycolytic pathway. This enzyme, categorized as a lyase, facilitates the reversible cleavage of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, a key step in cellular energy production (Chang2018Roles; Yao2004Hemolytic). Aldolase A is predominantly expressed in muscle tissue and red blood cells, where it supports high glycolytic flux necessary for ATP production, particularly under anaerobic conditions (Pirovich2021Multifunctional). Beyond its metabolic role, aldolase A is involved in various cellular processes, including interactions with the cytoskeleton and participation in DNA repair mechanisms, highlighting its multifunctional nature (Chang2018Roles; Sobanski2023The). Alterations in ALDOA expression are implicated in several pathological conditions, including hemolytic anemia and various cancers, where it is often associated with poor prognosis and increased metastatic potential (Chang2017Feedback; Yao2004Hemolytic).

## Structure
The ALDOA protein, encoded by the ALDOA gene, is a key enzyme in glycolysis. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the polypeptide chain, with specific residues such as Lys-227, Lys-107, and His-359 playing crucial roles in its catalytic activity (Lai1974Amino). The enzyme's secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its overall stability and function. The tertiary structure of ALDOA is a three-dimensional conformation essential for its enzymatic activity, allowing it to interact with substrates and other molecules effectively.

In its quaternary structure, ALDOA forms a homotetramer, meaning it consists of four identical subunits (Meighen1970Hybridization). This tetrameric arrangement is crucial for its function in glycolysis, as it facilitates the reversible cleavage of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Lai1974Amino). The enzyme may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can affect its activity and interactions.

ALDOA also has splice variant isoforms, which can influence its function and localization. For instance, alternative splicing events have been linked to tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer, highlighting the functional diversity of ALDOA isoforms (Yu2024Alternative).

## Function
The ALDOA gene encodes aldolase A, a key enzyme in the glycolysis pathway. It catalyzes the conversion of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, a crucial step for energy production in cells (Chang2018Roles; Yao2004Hemolytic). Aldolase A is predominantly active in muscle tissue and red blood cells, where it supports high glycolytic flux necessary for ATP production, especially under anaerobic conditions (Chang2018Roles; Pirovich2021Multifunctional).

Beyond its role in glycolysis, aldolase A participates in various cellular processes. It interacts with proteins involved in maintaining the cytoskeleton and signaling pathways, such as F-actin and phospholipase D2, influencing cell structure and function (Chang2018Roles). Aldolase A also plays a role in regulating calcium transport during muscle activation, which is vital for muscle contraction and overall homeostasis (Chang2018Roles).

Aldolase A's activity is linked to metabolic reprogramming, as it is a target of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1a), which modulates glycolysis and influences lactate production (Chang2018Roles). These functions highlight aldolase A's importance in both energy metabolism and broader physiological processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the ALDOA gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. ALDOA deficiency, caused by compound heterozygous mutations, can lead to severe clinical manifestations such as hemolytic anemia, muscle weakness, rhabdomyolysis, and hyperkalemia. These symptoms are due to the enzyme's crucial role in ATP production in erythrocytes and muscle fibers, and the deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder (Yao2004Hemolytic).

In cancer, ALDOA is frequently overexpressed and linked to poor prognosis. In lung cancer, particularly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and lung adenocarcinoma, elevated ALDOA expression is associated with increased metastatic potential and poor survival outcomes. This overexpression stabilizes hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α), promoting cancer cell invasion and migration through the activation of matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) (Lu2021Prognostic; Chang2017Feedback). ALDOA also interacts with cell cycle-related genes, contributing to tumor progression in various cancers, including breast and cervical cancers (Zhang2017Elevated).

The ALDOA/g-actin interaction, specific to metastatic lung cancer cells, enhances metastatic ability by modulating actin polymerization. Targeting this interaction has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy to inhibit metastasis (Chang2019Therapeutic).

## Interactions
ALDOA, or aldolase A, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes beyond its glycolytic function. It interacts with DNA-PKcs and ATM kinase complexes, which are crucial for DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. These interactions facilitate the kinase activity of DNA-PKcs and ATM, essential for efficient DSB repair through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) pathways. ALDOA translocates to the nucleus upon DNA damage, where it partially colocalizes with γ-H2AX, ATM, and DNA-PK, indicating its active role in the DNA damage response (Sobanski2023The).

In the context of cancer, ALDOA interacts with g-actin, enhancing the metastatic potential of lung cancer cells. This interaction is crucial for actin polymerization, which is necessary for cancer cell migration and invasion. Specific residues on ALDOA, such as K293, are important for this interaction, and mutations at these sites can disrupt the binding, reducing metastatic ability. Targeting the ALDOA/g-actin interaction has been explored as a therapeutic strategy to inhibit lung cancer metastasis (Chang2019Therapeutic).

ALDOA also interacts with F-actin in glioma cells, where its role is modulated by the long non-coding RNA ARST. ARST affects ALDOA's binding to F-actin, influencing actin filament integrity and cellular dynamics (Sun2021A).
