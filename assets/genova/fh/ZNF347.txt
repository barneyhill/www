# ZNF347

## Overview
ZNF347 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 347, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are small protein structural motifs that can coordinate one or more zinc ions to help stabilize their folds. Zinc finger proteins are often involved in DNA binding and play critical roles in transcriptional regulation, cellular differentiation, and development. The specific functions and interactions of zinc finger protein 347 remain to be fully elucidated, but it is believed to participate in various cellular processes through its role as a transcription factor. Understanding the precise mechanisms and pathways involving ZNF347 could provide insights into its potential implications in health and disease.
