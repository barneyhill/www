# VDAC3

## Overview
VDAC3, or Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel 3, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein located in the outer mitochondrial membrane. This protein is a member of the voltage-dependent anion channel family, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of ion and metabolite exchange between the mitochondria and the cytosol. VDAC3 is structurally characterized by a β-barrel formation, similar to other VDAC isoforms, and is involved in various cellular processes, including mitochondrial quality control, redox signaling, and protein organization. Despite sharing significant sequence identity with VDAC1 and VDAC2, VDAC3 exhibits unique functional properties, particularly in its interactions with proteins involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway and oxidative stress response (Messina2014Live; Reina2022VoltageDependent). The protein's role in health and disease, including its implications in male infertility, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases, underscores its importance in cellular homeostasis and pathology (Pittalà2022Specific; Reina2016VDAC3; Sampson2001Immotile).

## Structure
VDAC3 is a member of the voltage-dependent anion channel family, located in the outer mitochondrial membrane. Its primary structure shares about 60-70% sequence identity with VDAC1 and VDAC2, and it contains six cysteine residues, which are crucial for its function and redox regulation (De2016Role; Reina2022VoltageDependent). The secondary structure of VDAC3 is predicted to form a β-barrel composed of 19 β-strands, similar to VDAC1 and VDAC2, with an N-terminal α-helix (Messina2012VDAC; Reina2022VoltageDependent).

The tertiary structure of VDAC3 has not been resolved, but models suggest it adopts a similar barrel shape to other VDAC isoforms, facilitating ion transport (Messina2012VDAC). The N-terminal region is mobile and plays a role in voltage gating and interaction with other proteins (Reina2022VoltageDependent). VDAC3's quaternary structure may involve oligomerization, as indicated by studies on its stability and aggregation (Gupta2019Helix–strand).

VDAC3 undergoes post-translational modifications, including disulfide-bond formation, which affects its gating properties and interaction with redox signals (Okazaki2015VDAC3). These modifications are crucial for its function in oxidative stress response and mitochondrial signaling (Reina2022VoltageDependent).

## Function
VDAC3 (Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel 3) is a protein located in the outer mitochondrial membrane, playing a crucial role in cellular processes by facilitating the exchange of ions and metabolites between the mitochondria and the cytosol. It is involved in the organization, maturation, and recycling of proteins, particularly in relation to the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway (ERAD) and mitochondrial proteostasis (Messina2014Live). VDAC3 interacts with proteins involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, chaperones, and cytoskeletal components, suggesting a role in protein quality control and subcellular organization (Messina2014Live).

VDAC3 is less sensitive to tubulin interaction compared to other VDAC isoforms, indicating its involvement in organizational processes of subcellular structures (Messina2014Live). It is also associated with redox signaling pathways and protection against oxidative injury (Messina2014Live). VDAC3's strategic localization in the mitochondrial outer membrane suggests it may serve as a docking site for other proteins, influencing channel activity or serving as a contact point for cytoskeletal proteins (Messina2014Live). Despite its structural similarities with other VDAC isoforms, VDAC3's specific function in healthy human cells remains less clear, as its structure has not been fully determined (Reina2016VDAC3).

## Clinical Significance
VDAC3 has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in mitochondrial function and cellular stress responses. In the context of male infertility, VDAC3 deficiency in mice leads to immotile sperm and infertility, highlighting its importance in maintaining sperm axoneme structure and function (Sampson2001Immotile). This deficiency results in structural defects in sperm axonemes and reduced motility, which are not observed in other ciliary structures like tracheal cilia (Sampson2001Immotile).

In cancer, VDAC3 is involved in the cellular response to the antitumor agent erastin, which induces oxidative, non-apoptotic cell death in certain tumor cells. Erastin binds to VDAC3, leading to its downregulation, suggesting a specific role in modulating the response to oxidative stress in cancer cells (Reina2016VDAC3).

VDAC3 is also associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In ALS models, VDAC3 undergoes specific post-translational modifications, including oxidation and deamidation, which may affect its function and contribute to disease pathology by influencing oxidative stress responses and mitochondrial quality control (Pittalà2022Specific). These modifications highlight VDAC3's potential role as an oxidative stress sensor in neurodegenerative conditions (Pittalà2022Specific).

## Interactions
VDAC3, a voltage-dependent anion channel located in the outer mitochondrial membrane, participates in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It interacts with proteins involved in mitochondrial quality control, such as those in the PINK1/Parkin system, where VDAC3 is ubiquitinated by Parkin in defective mitochondria, facilitating mitophagy (Reina2016VDAC3). VDAC3 also interacts with proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum, including Grp75, Hsp70, and calreticulin, which are markers of mitochondria-associated membranes (MAM) (Reina2016VDAC3).

The protein is involved in the organization and recycling of proteins, interacting with components of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, ubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation systems (Messina2014Live). VDAC3's interactions extend to proteins involved in oxidative stress response, protein folding, and cellular signaling pathways, including prohibitin (PHB) and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) (Messina2014Live).

In the context of disease, VDAC3 interacts with viral proteins such as the Hepatitis B virus-encoded protein HBx, which affects mitochondrial function and activates transcription factors like STAT-3 and NF-kB (Kanwar2020VDAC). These interactions highlight VDAC3's role in various cellular and pathological processes.
