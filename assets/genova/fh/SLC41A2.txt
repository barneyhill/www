# SLC41A2

## Overview
SLC41A2 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 41 member 2, which is part of the solute carrier family involved in the transport of magnesium ions across cellular membranes. The SLC41A2 protein is characterized as a transmembrane transporter, featuring 10 predicted transmembrane domains that facilitate its role in ion transport (Goytain2005Functional). It is structurally similar to other members of the SLC41 family and is considered a vertebral orthologue of the bacterial Mg2+ channel MgtE (Franken2022Structural). Unlike its homolog SLC41A1, the expression of SLC41A2 is not regulated by magnesium levels, suggesting a unique regulatory mechanism (Goytain2005Functional). The protein's function is crucial for maintaining magnesium homeostasis in epithelial cells, and it also transports other divalent cations, although its activity is inhibited by high concentrations of calcium ions (Goytain2005Functional).

## Structure
The SLC41A2 protein is a member of the solute carrier family and functions as a magnesium transporter. It shares structural similarities with other members of the SLC41 family, such as SLC41A1 and SLC41A3, and is considered a vertebral orthologue of the bacterial Mg2+ channel MgtE (Franken2022Structural). The protein is predicted to have 10 transmembrane domains, which are characteristic of its role in transporting ions across cellular membranes (Goytain2005Functional). These transmembrane regions likely contribute to the protein's secondary and tertiary structures, facilitating its function as a transporter.

SLC41A2 also contains numerous C-terminal N-glycosylation sites, which are post-translational modifications that may play a role in its stability and function (Goytain2005Functional). Unlike SLC41A1, the expression of SLC41A2 is not responsive to magnesium levels, indicating a distinct regulatory mechanism (Goytain2005Functional). While the specific quaternary structure of SLC41A2 is not detailed, its functional characterization suggests it operates as a monomeric transporter, similar to other solute carriers. The molecular mode of action of SLC41A2, including its potential interactions with other proteins or ions, remains to be fully elucidated (Franken2022Structural).

## Function
SLC41A2 is a member of the solute carrier family involved in magnesium (Mg2+) transport across cellular membranes. It functions primarily as a Mg2+ transporter, facilitating the uptake of magnesium into cells. This protein is active in the plasma membrane, where it mediates voltage-dependent and saturable Mg2+ uptake with a Michaelis constant of 0.34 ± 0.05 mM (Goytain2005Functional). SLC41A2 also transports other divalent cations such as Ba2+, Ni2+, Co2+, Fe2+, and Mn2+, but not Ca2+, Zn2+, or Cu2+ (Goytain2005Functional). The transport of Mg2+ by SLC41A2 is inhibited by high concentrations of Ca2+ (Goytain2005Functional).

Unlike its homolog SLC41A1, the expression of SLC41A2 is not regulated by magnesium levels, as demonstrated in renal distal tubule epithelial cells and kidney cortex of mice (Goytain2005Functional). This suggests that SLC41A2 plays a consistent role in maintaining magnesium homeostasis in epithelial cells, independent of external magnesium availability. The protein's structure includes 10 predicted transmembrane domains and numerous C-terminal N-glycosylation sites, indicating its role as an integral membrane protein involved in cellular magnesium homeostasis (Goytain2005Functional).
