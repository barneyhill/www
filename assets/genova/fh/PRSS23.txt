# PRSS23

## Overview
PRSS23 is a gene that encodes the protein serine protease 23, which is a member of the serine protease family. This protein is involved in various biological processes, including cellular proliferation and developmental pathways. Serine protease 23 is particularly significant in the context of estrogen receptor α (ERα) signaling in breast cancer, where it is upregulated and contributes to estrogen-induced cell proliferation (Chan2012Serine). Additionally, PRSS23 plays a crucial role in the endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) during cardiac valve development, highlighting its importance in both cancer biology and cardiac morphogenesis (Chen2012PRSS23). The protein's enzymatic activity is essential for its function, influencing protease activities and interacting with key regulatory proteins in these processes (Chen2012PRSS23).

## Function
PRSS23, a serine protease, plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of estrogen receptor α (ERα) signaling in breast cancer cells. It is upregulated by ERα and is involved in estrogen-induced cell proliferation, suggesting its role in cell cycle regulation and DNA replication (Chan2012Serine). PRSS23 is localized in the nuclei of breast cancer cells, where it may interact with proteins involved in chromosome condensation and segregation, indicating its potential involvement in chromosome replication and repair during the cell cycle (Chan2012Serine).

In addition to its role in breast cancer, PRSS23 is implicated in the endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) during cardiac valve development. It is essential for the initiation of EndoMT, a critical process in cardiac valve morphogenesis, by regulating the expression of Snail, a key transcription factor in this pathway (Chen2012PRSS23). PRSS23's enzymatic activity is crucial for its function in these processes, as demonstrated by its involvement in the regulation of protease activities during cardiac development (Chen2012PRSS23). These roles highlight PRSS23's importance in both cellular proliferation and developmental processes.

## Clinical Significance
PRSS23 (serine protease 23) has been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer. Alterations in PRSS23 expression are associated with the progression of gastric cancer. Studies have shown that PRSS23 is crucial for gastric cancer progression, with its knockdown affecting several signaling pathways and biological processes, potentially serving as new targets for treatment (Wang2022PRSS23). Increased expression of PRSS23 is also observed in cancer stem cells and is related to tumor progression in multiple cancers (Wang2022PRSS23).

In addition to its role in cancer, PRSS23 is involved in the endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) during cardiac development. In zebrafish, PRSS23 knockdown leads to atrioventricular canal malformation, indicating its essential role in heart valve formation (Chen2012PRSS23). This function is evolutionarily conserved, as human PRSS23 can rescue defects in zebrafish prss23 morphants (Chen2012PRSS23). Although the clinical significance of PRSS23 mutations in humans is not fully elucidated, its role in cardiac development suggests potential implications for congenital heart diseases related to valve formation (Chen2012PRSS23).

## Interactions
PRSS23, or serine protease 23, is involved in several protein interactions that influence various biological processes. In the context of endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT), PRSS23 interacts with the Snail protein, a key regulator of this process. PRSS23 knockdown results in a limited increase in Snail protein levels after TGF-b2 stimulation, suggesting a regulatory role in Snail expression through a TCF12-dependent pathway (Chen2012PRSS23). PRSS23 and TCF12 co-localize in the nuclei of human aortic endothelial cells and physically interact, as confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation assays (Chen2012PRSS23).

In breast cancer, PRSS23 is upregulated by estrogen receptor α (ERα) and is involved in estrogen-induced cell proliferation. It may interact with NCAPD3, a protein associated with chromosome condensation and DNA repair, indicating a potential role in chromosome replication during the cell cycle in ERα-positive breast cancer cells (Chan2012Serine). These interactions highlight PRSS23's involvement in critical cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
