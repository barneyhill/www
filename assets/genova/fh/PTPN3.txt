# PTPN3

## Overview
PTPN3 is a gene that encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 3, a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family. This protein is characterized by its multidomain structure, which includes an N-terminal FERM domain, a central PDZ domain, and a C-terminal PTP domain, each contributing to its diverse functional roles in cellular signaling (Genera2023Interactions). The PTPN3 protein is involved in regulating key signaling pathways, such as the TGF-β signaling pathway, and plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and modulating immune responses (Yuan2019PTPN; Genera2021Molecular). It acts as a tumor suppressor in various cancers by stabilizing receptors and interacting with viral and cellular proteins through its PDZ domain, influencing processes like cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis (Zhang2020MicroRNA5745p; Yuan2019PTPN). The clinical significance of PTPN3 is underscored by its altered expression in different cancers, where it can either suppress tumor growth or contribute to drug resistance, depending on the context (Li2016Protein; Yuan2019PTPN).

## Structure
PTPN3 is a multidomain protein consisting of 913 amino acids, featuring an N-terminal FERM domain, a central PDZ domain, a short linker, and a C-terminal protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) domain (Genera2023Interactions). The FERM domain is responsible for subcellular localization, while the PDZ domain facilitates protein-protein interactions (Genera2023Interactions). The PDZ domain of PTPN3 exhibits a typical fold with a β-sandwich structure comprising five β-strands and two α-helices (Genera2019Structural). This domain is involved in recognizing PDZ-binding motifs (PBMs) from various partners, including viral proteins like the E6 oncoprotein from human papillomavirus (HPV) (Genera2019Structural).

The PDZ domain's interaction with PBMs involves a hydrophobic cleft formed by the β2-strand, the α2-helix, and the 'GLGF' loop, which is crucial for binding specificity (Genera2019Structural). The linker between the PDZ and PTP domains, approximately 30 residues long, plays a role in regulating phosphatase activity by mediating auto-inhibition (Genera2023Interactions). The PDZ domain's ability to bind both viral and cellular PBMs suggests a competitive interaction landscape, influencing PTPN3's role in cellular signaling and oncogenic processes (Genera2019Structural).

## Function
PTPN3 is a protein tyrosine phosphatase that plays a significant role in regulating TGF-β signaling, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and adapting to external environments. It stabilizes the TGF-β type I receptor (TbRI) by preventing its degradation, thereby enhancing TGF-β signaling. This process is important for inhibiting cell proliferation, particularly in epithelial and endothelial cells, and contributes to PTPN3's function as a tumor suppressor (Yuan2019PTPN).

PTPN3 enhances TGF-β-induced transcription of genes involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, such as p21 and PAI-1. Its function in promoting TGF-β signaling is independent of its phosphatase activity, as both wild-type and catalytically inactive mutants can enhance TGF-β-induced reporter gene activity (Yuan2019PTPN).

In healthy human cells, PTPN3 likely contributes to normal TGF-β signaling, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing abnormal cell growth (Yuan2019PTPN). PTPN3 is active in the cytoplasm and interacts with various proteins, influencing cellular communication and immune responses (Genera2021Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PTPN3 gene have significant clinical implications in various cancers. In liver cancer, PTPN3 acts as a tumor suppressor by stabilizing the TGF-β receptor I, which is crucial for proper TGF-β signaling. This signaling pathway is important for inhibiting tumor growth and promoting apoptosis. However, PTPN3 expression is significantly downregulated in liver cancer, and low levels are associated with poorer survival outcomes (Yuan2019PTPN). A specific mutation, L232R, found in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, impairs PTPN3's ability to enhance TGF-β signaling, contributing to tumorigenesis (Yuan2019PTPN).

In ovarian cancer, PTPN3 is overexpressed in drug-resistant cells, contributing to chemotherapy resistance and poor prognosis. Silencing PTPN3 in these cells restores drug sensitivity, indicating its role in promoting drug resistance and stem cell-like characteristics (Li2016Protein). In clear cell renal cell carcinoma, PTPN3 suppresses tumor growth and metastasis by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Reduced expression of PTPN3 in these tumors correlates with poor prognosis, highlighting its role as a tumor suppressor (Peng2019PTPN3).

## Interactions
PTPN3, a protein tyrosine phosphatase, engages in various interactions with other proteins, influencing cellular processes and disease progression. It interacts with the PDZ-binding motifs (PBM) of viral proteins such as the human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 oncoproteins and the hepatitis B virus (HBV) core protein (HBc). These interactions involve the PDZ domain of PTPN3, which binds to the PBM of these viral proteins, potentially disrupting cellular signaling pathways and contributing to cancer progression (Genera2019Structural).

PTPN3 also interacts with cellular proteins like Src kinase and DAAM1 in lung cancer cells. It acts as a negative regulator by dephosphorylating Src and DAAM1, thereby inhibiting actin polymerization and reducing cell migration and invasion (Li2019PTPN3). This interaction highlights PTPN3's role in modulating cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular motility.

In gastric cancer, PTPN3 is targeted by miR-574-5p, which promotes angiogenesis by inhibiting PTPN3's dephosphorylation of ERK1/2, a key component of the MAPK signaling pathway. This interaction underscores PTPN3's involvement in regulating angiogenesis and cancer cell behavior (Zhang2020MicroRNA5745p).
