# FAM135A

## Overview
FAM135A is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 135 member A. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of cancer biology. FAM135A functions as a tumor suppressor and is involved in critical signaling pathways, such as the JAK-STAT pathway, which are essential for regulating cell proliferation and migration. The gene's expression is notably reduced in certain cancer types, such as breast cancer, where it is associated with poor prognosis and advanced disease stages. The protein encoded by FAM135A interacts with long non-coding RNAs, such as MIR17HG, which modulate its expression and influence cancer cell behavior. These interactions underscore the potential of FAM135A as a biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology (Xu2023LncRNA).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
FAM135A is implicated in breast cancer, where its expression is notably lower in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. This reduced expression is associated with poorer prognosis and advanced cancer stages in patients. FAM135A functions as a tumor suppressor, and its downregulation leads to increased proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells, particularly in MCF-7 cell lines. The gene is involved in several tumor-related signaling pathways, including the JAK-STAT pathway, which is crucial for cancer progression (Xu2023LncRNA).

The interaction between FAM135A and the lncRNA MIR17HG is significant in breast cancer. MIR17HG acts as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) that regulates FAM135A expression by sponging miR-454-3p. When MIR17HG is downregulated, miR-454-3p levels increase, leading to decreased FAM135A expression, which promotes cancer cell proliferation and migration. Conversely, overexpression of MIR17HG enhances FAM135A expression, resulting in reduced cancer cell proliferation and migration. This regulatory axis is proposed as a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer treatment (Xu2023LncRNA).

Overall, alterations in FAM135A expression and its interactions with other molecules play a critical role in breast cancer pathogenesis and progression, highlighting its clinical significance as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target.
