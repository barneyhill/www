# TADA3

## Overview
TADA3 is a gene that encodes the protein transcriptional adaptor 3, which is a critical component of the SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase) and ATAC (Ada Two A Containing) coactivator complexes. These complexes are involved in chromatin modification and transcription regulation, primarily through histone acetylation. The TADA3 protein functions as a transcriptional activator adaptor, playing a pivotal role in facilitating transcriptional activation and maintaining cellular homeostasis by influencing processes such as cell cycle progression, DNA repair, and apoptosis. It is particularly noted for its role in stabilizing and enhancing the activity of the p53 protein, which is crucial for cytokinesis and chromosomal stability. Structurally, TADA3 is suggested to contain coiled-coil domains that integrate it into the holo-SAGA complex, although detailed structural information remains limited (Helmlinger2021What; Espinola-Lopez2021The; pradhan2020significance).

## Structure
The TADA3 protein, also known as transcriptional adaptor 3, is a component of the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) module within the SAGA complex, which plays a crucial role in chromatin modification and gene expression regulation. TADA3 is involved in forming a ternary complex with Gcn5 and Ada2, essential for the acetylation of nucleosomes (Espinola-Lopez2021The). The protein is suggested to contain N-and C-terminal coiled-coil domains, which are important for its structural role in integrating the HAT module into the holo-SAGA complex (Helmlinger2021What). 

In the yeast SAGA complex, Ada3, the yeast homolog of TADA3, is attached to the HEAT repeat of Taf6 through a few helices, suggesting a similar structural role for TADA3 in the human SAGA complex (Zhang2022CryoEM). The interaction between Ada3 and Taf6 is crucial for docking the HAT module to the rest of the SAGA complex, indicating that TADA3 may have a similar function in humans (Helmlinger2021What). Despite these insights, detailed structural information about TADA3, including its specific domains or motifs, remains limited, with some predicted coiled-coil regions but no recognizable domains (Espinola-Lopez2021The).

## Function
TADA3, also known as transcriptional adaptor 3, is a component of the SAGA and ATAC coactivator complexes, which are involved in chromatin modification and transcription regulation. In healthy human cells, TADA3 functions as a transcriptional activator adaptor within these complexes, playing a crucial role in histone acetylation and facilitating transcriptional activation (Arede2021Buffering). TADA3 is part of the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) modules of the SAGA and ATAC complexes, which are important for transcription regulation (Fischer2021The).

TADA3 is active in the nucleus, where it influences cell cycle progression, DNA repair, and apoptosis, contributing to cellular homeostasis. It stabilizes and enhances p53 protein activity, which is associated with cytokinesis and chromosomal stability (pradhan2020significance). The protein is involved in regulating mitotic progression by controlling non-histone targets, and its depletion can lead to defects in cell cycle progression and the formation of multinucleated cells (pradhan2020significance).

In embryonic stem cells, TADA3's role in transcription regulation appears to be largely independent of its HAT activities, suggesting that SAGA and ATAC have distinct, non-redundant functions in gene expression regulation (Fischer2021The).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
TADA3, also known as transcriptional adaptor 3, is a component of the SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase) complex, which plays a crucial role in chromatin modification and transcription regulation. Within the SAGA complex, TADA3 interacts with several other proteins, including Gcn5, Ada2, and Sgf29, forming a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) module. This module is essential for acetylating nucleosomal histones, particularly influencing H3 acetylation through interactions with methylated H3K4 (Helmlinger2021What; Espinola-Lopez2021The).

TADA3 is also involved in the ADA complex, where it interacts with Gcn5 and Ada2. This interaction is necessary for the acetylation of nucleosomal histones and the transcriptional activation of specific genes (Grant1997Yeast). The presence of TADA3 is critical for the structural integrity and function of these complexes, as its deletion results in the loss of the entire HAT module from the SAGA complex (Helmlinger2021What).

In addition to its role in histone modification, TADA3 is known to stabilize and enhance p53 protein activity by promoting its acetylation, which is significant for cell cycle progression and chromatin modulation (pradhan2020significance).
