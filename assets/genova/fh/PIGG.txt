# PIGG

## Overview
The PIGG gene encodes the enzyme phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class G, which plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. These anchors are essential for attaching proteins to the cell membrane, thereby facilitating various cellular processes such as signaling and adhesion. The PIGG protein functions as an ethanolamine phosphate (EtNP) transferase, specifically adding EtNP to the second mannose in the GPI structure, a critical step in the maturation of GPI-anchored proteins (Zhao2017Reduced; Makrythanasis2016Pathogenic). Although the EtNP modification is transient, it is crucial for the stability and organization of GPI-anchored proteins within the membrane (Makrythanasis2016Pathogenic). PIGG operates within the endoplasmic reticulum and is involved in complex interactions with other proteins, such as PIG-F, which are vital for its function and the integrity of the GPI biosynthesis pathway (Stokes2014New; KINOSHITA2014Biosynthesis). Pathogenic variants in the PIGG gene are linked to neurological disorders, underscoring its importance in human health (Makrythanasis2016Pathogenic).

## Function
The PIGG gene encodes an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, which are crucial for attaching proteins to the cell membrane. This enzyme, known as EtNP transferase, facilitates the conversion of the GPI precursor H7 to the mature precursor H8 by adding an ethanolamine phosphate (EtNP) to the second mannose in the GPI structure (Zhao2017Reduced; Makrythanasis2016Pathogenic). This modification is essential for the proper assembly and function of GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs), which play significant roles in cell signaling, adhesion, and other cellular processes (KINOSHITA2014Biosynthesis).

PIGG operates within the endoplasmic reticulum, where it contributes to the efficient sorting and transport of GPI-APs to the cell surface (Zhao2017Reduced). Although the EtNP modification is transient and removed by PGAP5, its presence is important for the organization and stability of GPI-APs in the membrane (Makrythanasis2016Pathogenic). Despite its non-essential role in GPI-AP biosynthesis, PIGG is critical for neurological development, as pathogenic variants in the gene are linked to intellectual disability, seizures, and hypotonia (Makrythanasis2016Pathogenic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PIGG gene are associated with a range of neurological disorders, primarily characterized by intellectual disability, developmental delay, seizures, and hypotonia. These conditions are a result of PIGG's role in the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) biosynthesis pathway, which is crucial for anchoring proteins to the cell membrane (Zhao2017Reduced; Makrythanasis2016Pathogenic). Individuals with PIGG deficiency often exhibit normal levels of GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) on granulocytes, which is atypical compared to other GPI deficiencies (Makrythanasis2016Pathogenic; TremblayLaganière2021PIGG).

Clinical features of PIGG deficiency include cerebellar atrophy, ataxia, and minor facial dysmorphisms. Additional symptoms may include nystagmus, strabismus, tremor, diminished deep tendon reflexes, microcephaly, autism spectrum disorder, and short stature (TremblayLaganière2021PIGG). The severity of these symptoms often correlates with the level of PIGG activity, with null or severely decreased activity leading to more severe phenotypes (TremblayLaganière2021PIGG).

Research has also indicated a potential link between PIGG deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction, suggesting that GPI-APs may interact with mitochondrial membrane proteins (TremblayLaganière2021PIGG). This connection highlights the complexity of PIGG-related disorders and the need for further investigation into their underlying mechanisms.

## Interactions
The PIGG protein is involved in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors and participates in several key interactions within this pathway. PIGG is a mammalian ortholog of the yeast GPI7 and functions as a catalytic component of GPI-EtNP transferase II, which is responsible for transferring ethanolamine phosphate to the second mannose in the GPI structure (KINOSHITA2014Biosynthesis). 

PIGG forms a complex with PIG-F, which stabilizes PIGG and is crucial for its function. This interaction is competitive, as PIGG and PIG-O both vie for binding to PIG-F, indicating a regulatory mechanism in the GPI biosynthesis pathway (KINOSHITA2014Biosynthesis). The interaction between PIGG and PIG-F is significant for the proper functioning of the GPI-EtNP transferase II complex, highlighting the importance of these protein-protein interactions in maintaining the integrity of the GPI anchor biosynthesis process (Stokes2014New).

Mutations in the PIGG gene can disrupt these interactions, leading to intellectual disability and other neurological symptoms, as evidenced by studies on affected individuals (Zhao2017Reduced; Makrythanasis2016Pathogenic). These findings underscore the critical role of PIGG in the GPI biosynthesis pathway and its interactions with other proteins.
