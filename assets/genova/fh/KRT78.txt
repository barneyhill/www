# KRT78

## Overview
KRT78 is a gene that encodes keratin 78, a type II epithelial keratin protein. As a member of the keratin family, keratin 78 plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and mechanical resilience of epithelial cells. The protein is characterized by its canonical keratin structure, which includes a head, coiled-coil, and tail region, and is primarily expressed in differentiated esophageal epithelial cells. Keratin 78 is involved in epithelial differentiation processes and is enriched in quiescent prostate stem cells, suggesting a role in stem cell maintenance and differentiation (Hu2021Keratin; KC2015In). Additionally, KRT78 has been implicated in the pathophysiology of keratoconus, a corneal disorder, where altered RNA editing of the gene may contribute to disease progression (Bortoletto2023MetaAnalysis).

## Structure
KRT78, a type II epithelial keratin, exhibits a canonical keratin structure. Its primary structure includes a head region (amino acids 1-111), a coiled-coil region (amino acids 112-424), and a tail region (amino acids 425-520) (KC2015In). The coiled-coil region is particularly conserved among higher mammals, indicating its structural importance (KC2015In). 

The secondary structure of KRT78 is characterized by alpha-helices, which are typical of keratin proteins. These helices form the basis of the coiled-coil tertiary structure, allowing for the formation of a filamentous network within the cytoplasm of epithelial cells (KC2015In). 

In terms of quaternary structure, KRT78 likely forms heterodimers with type I keratins, a common feature of type II keratins, facilitating the assembly of intermediate filaments that provide structural support to epithelial cells. 

Post-translational modifications of KRT78 may include phosphorylation and glycosylation, which are common in keratins and can affect their function and interaction with other proteins. These modifications can play roles in regulating the protein's stability and assembly into filaments. 

Overall, KRT78's structure is integral to its function in maintaining the integrity and resilience of epithelial tissues.

## Function
KRT78 (keratin 78) is a type II epithelial keratin involved in maintaining the structural integrity of epithelial cells. It forms a filamentous network throughout the cytoplasm, similar to other type II keratins, providing mechanical support and resilience to cells (KC2015In). KRT78 is primarily expressed in differentiated esophageal epithelial cells, where it plays a role in epithelial differentiation processes (KC2015In). The protein's expression is highly conserved among higher mammals, particularly in the coiled-coil region, which is crucial for its structural function (KC2015In).

In the context of prostate stem cells, KRT78 is enriched in quiescent stem cells, indicating its association with maintaining a stem cell state (Hu2021Keratin). This suggests that KRT78 may be involved in the early stages of lineage commitment in prostate stem cells, marking the transition from quiescent to active states (Hu2021Keratin). The expression of KRT78 shifts as stem cells progress through the lineage hierarchy, highlighting its role in the dynamic regulation of stem cell differentiation (Hu2021Keratin). However, specific functional details about KRT78 in healthy human cells beyond its role as a marker in these contexts are not extensively detailed in the available literature.

## Clinical Significance
KRT78 has been implicated in the pathophysiology of keratoconus, a corneal disorder characterized by the thinning and conical deformation of the cornea. Research indicates that KRT78 is upregulated in keratoconus, with novel RNA editing sites showing higher frequencies in affected individuals compared to controls. This suggests that altered RNA editing of KRT78 may contribute to the disease's progression by impacting gene expression profiles (Bortoletto2023MetaAnalysis). The study highlights that while KRT78 is upregulated, the expression levels of some keratins do not necessarily correlate with editing frequency, indicating a complex relationship between RNA editing and gene expression in keratoconus (Bortoletto2023MetaAnalysis).

The research also suggests that the altered RNA editing observed in keratoconus, including in KRT78, may be linked to specific cellular conditions, although the precise functional implications require further investigation (Bortoletto2023MetaAnalysis). The findings underscore the potential role of RNA editing in the pathogenesis of keratoconus, suggesting that KRT78 and its altered interactions could be significant in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying this condition (Bortoletto2023MetaAnalysis).
