# FGA

## Overview
The FGA gene encodes the fibrinogen alpha chain, a vital component of the fibrinogen protein complex, which plays a crucial role in the blood coagulation process. Fibrinogen is a glycoprotein composed of three pairs of polypeptide chains: Aα, Bβ, and γ, with the alpha chain being encoded by the FGA gene. This protein is primarily synthesized in the liver and is essential for the formation of fibrin, the protein that stabilizes blood clots, thereby preventing excessive bleeding (Paraboschi2017Fibrinogen; Wang2022Germline). The fibrinogen alpha chain is involved in various interactions, including those with integrins, which facilitate cell adhesion and migration, and with platelet glycoprotein IIb-IIIa, which is crucial for platelet aggregation (Chen2019Fibrinogen; Farrell1992Role). Mutations in the FGA gene can lead to bleeding disorders such as congenital afibrinogenemia and dysfibrinogenemia, highlighting its clinical significance (Spena2004Congenital; Qiao2020A).

## Structure
The FGA gene encodes the fibrinogen alpha chain, a crucial component of the fibrinogen molecule involved in blood clotting. Fibrinogen is a hexamer composed of two sets of three polypeptide chains: Aα, Bβ, and γ, linked by disulfide bonds (Cheung2008Variation). The primary structure of the Aα chain consists of 610 amino acids with a molecular weight of 68 kDa (Cheung2008Variation). The secondary structure includes regions that form alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to the overall stability and function of the protein.

The tertiary structure of the fibrinogen alpha chain involves its folding into a specific three-dimensional shape, which is essential for its interaction with other fibrinogen chains and for its role in clot formation. The quaternary structure of fibrinogen involves the assembly of the Aα, Bβ, and γ chains into a complex hexameric structure, forming a central E region and two peripheral D regions (Cheung2008Variation).

Post-translational modifications of the fibrinogen alpha chain include phosphorylation, glycation, glycosylation, oxidization, sialylation, and deamidation, which can influence its characteristics and function (Cheung2008Variation). The FGA gene also has an alternative transcription variant that includes exon six, resulting in a minor form known as fibrinogen-420, which is more prevalent in newborns (Cheung2008Variation).

## Function
The FGA gene encodes the fibrinogen alpha chain, a crucial component of fibrinogen, which is a glycoprotein complex essential for blood clotting and hemostasis. In healthy human cells, fibrinogen is synthesized in the liver and consists of three polypeptide chains: Aα, Bβ, and γ, encoded by the FGA, FGB, and FGG genes, respectively (Paraboschi2017Fibrinogen). The fibrinogen alpha chain plays a significant role in the structural integrity and function of fibrinogen, contributing to the formation of fibrin, which stabilizes blood clots (Paraboschi2017Fibrinogen).

During the blood coagulation process, thrombin cleaves fibrinopeptides A and B from fibrinogen, leading to the polymerization of fibrin and the formation of a stable fibrin matrix. This matrix is essential for stopping bleeding by forming a clot at the site of vascular injury (Wang2022Germline). The FGA gene's function is critical in maintaining normal blood coagulation processes, and any variants in this gene can lead to defective fibrin fibers, potentially resulting in conditions like thrombosis (Wang2022Germline). The protein is primarily active in the liver, where fibrinogen is synthesized, and plays a crucial role in wound healing and maintaining hemostasis (Paraboschi2017Fibrinogen).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FGA gene, which encodes the fibrinogen alpha chain, are associated with several bleeding disorders due to their impact on fibrinogen production and function. Congenital afibrinogenemia, a severe bleeding disorder, results from biallelic mutations in the FGA gene that lead to the complete absence of fibrinogen in the blood. This condition is characterized by unmeasurable levels of plasma fibrinogen and severe bleeding episodes (Spena2004Congenital; NeermanArbez2006Molecular). A notable mutation causing afibrinogenemia is a 15-kb deletion in the FGA gene, which was identified in a Thai proband and is the largest known deletion associated with this disorder (Spena2004Congenital).

Dysfibrinogenemia, another condition linked to FGA mutations, involves normal fibrinogen levels but with reduced functional activity. This disorder can lead to bleeding, thrombosis, or both, and is often caused by missense mutations in the FGA gene (Qiao2020A; NeermanArbez2006Molecular). The FGA gene is also implicated in hereditary renal amyloidosis, where specific mutations lead to fibrinogen amyloidosis, causing symptoms like hypertension and proteinuria (Paraboschi2017Fibrinogen). These conditions highlight the clinical significance of FGA gene mutations in various fibrinogen-related disorders.

## Interactions
The fibrinogen alpha chain (FGA) is involved in several key interactions that are crucial for its function in coagulation and cellular processes. FGA is a component of fibrinogen, which interacts with platelet glycoprotein IIb-IIIa (GPIIb-IIIa), an integrin receptor, to mediate platelet aggregation. Although the RGD sequences in the alpha chain are present, they are not essential for platelet aggregation. Instead, the carboxyl-terminal region of the gamma chain plays a more critical role in this process (Farrell1992Role).

FGA also contains arginyl-glycyl-aspartic acid (RGD) motifs that serve as binding sites for integrins, facilitating cell adhesion and migration. These interactions are significant in the context of endometriosis, where FGA is up-regulated and affects cellular behaviors such as adhesion, migration, and invasion (Chen2019Fibrinogen).

In addition to its role in coagulation, FGA polymorphisms can influence its interaction with nuclear proteins, affecting transcriptional activity. Specific polymorphisms in the FGA promoter region can alter binding to nuclear factors, thereby regulating FGA transcription (Ko2005Functional).
