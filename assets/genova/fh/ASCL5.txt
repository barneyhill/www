# ASCL5

## Overview
The ASCL5 gene encodes the achaete-scute family bHLH transcription factor 5, which is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors. These proteins are crucial in the regulation of gene expression during developmental processes, particularly in the nervous system. ASCL5 is involved in the differentiation of neural progenitor cells and plays a significant role in neurogenesis. The protein functions by binding to E-box sequences in the DNA, thereby influencing the transcription of target genes involved in cell fate determination. Dysregulation of ASCL5 has been implicated in various neurological disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal neural development and function (Qiu2020aarFDC).
