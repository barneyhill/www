# LGALS12

## Overview
LGALS12 is a gene that encodes the protein galectin-12, a member of the galectin family characterized by its tandem-repeat structure and involvement in carbohydrate recognition. Galectin-12 is primarily expressed in adipocytes, sebocytes, and macrophages, where it plays a significant role in regulating lipid metabolism, energy balance, and cellular stress responses. As a tandem-repeat type galectin, it contains two carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs) that facilitate its interaction with specific glycans, influencing processes such as lipolysis, glucose homeostasis, and endothelial cell function. Galectin-12 is also implicated in macrophage polarization and has been associated with inflammation and metabolic disorders. In the context of cancer, particularly colon cancer, galectin-12 is suggested to act as a tumor suppressor by modulating cellular metabolism and inhibiting tumor growth through its interactions with proteins involved in glutamine uptake and metabolism (Katzenmaier2019Deciphering; Maller2019An).

## Structure
Galectin-12 (LGALS12) is a tandem-repeat type galectin characterized by two carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs) connected by a linker sequence. The primary sequence of Galectin-12 consists of 314 amino acids, with distinct N-terminal (Gal-12N-CRD) and C-terminal (Gal-12C-CRD) domains. The N-terminal CRD shares homology with other galectins but lacks certain conserved residues, with His and Asn replaced by Arg and Ser, respectively. The C-terminal CRD shows significant divergence from other galectins, retaining only the Trp 257 residue crucial for stacking interactions with galactose moieties (Maller2019An).

The secondary structure of Galectin-12 includes six β-strands in both the S-sheet and F-sheet of the N-terminal domain, with an additional F' strand typical of tandem-repeat galectins (Maller2019An). Galectin-12 exhibits a highly hydrophobic profile, similar to proteins found in lipid droplets, and is predominantly located on large lipid droplets in adipocytes (Maller2019An).

Galectin-12's quaternary structure is not explicitly detailed, but it is known to form dimers or oligomers, a common feature among galectins. The protein's hydrophobic nature and low affinity for lactose present challenges in its expression and purification (Maller2019An). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, although specific modifications for Galectin-12 are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
Galectin-12, encoded by the LGALS12 gene, is a tandem-repeat type galectin primarily expressed in adipocytes, sebocytes, and macrophages. It plays a crucial role in adipocyte differentiation, lipid metabolism, and energy balance. Galectin-12 is involved in the regulation of lipolysis and glucose homeostasis, acting as a negative regulator of lipolysis by controlling protein kinase A signaling. It is localized within the inner side of lipid droplets in adipocytes and is upregulated under hypoxic conditions, suggesting a role in cellular stress responses (Maller2019An; Yang2016Identification).

Galectin-12 also influences endothelial cell function by preferentially recognizing 3-fucosylated glycans, which may affect processes like cell migration and angiogenesis. This interaction is crucial for endothelial cell behavior and contributes to vascularization processes, particularly under hypoxic conditions (Maller2019An).

In addition to its role in adipose tissue, Galectin-12 is involved in macrophage polarization, promoting a proinflammatory M1 profile, which links it to adipocyte-macrophage cross-talk and potentially to inflammation and metabolic disorders (Maller2019An). Its expression is also associated with maintaining cellular homeostasis and differentiation in healthy cells (Katzenmaier2019Deciphering).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LGALS12 gene, which encodes galectin-12, have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In metabolic disorders, galectin-12 is highly expressed in adipose tissues and plays a role in preadipocyte differentiation and expansion. Lgals12 knockout mice exhibit increased insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, suggesting a link between galectin-12 and diabetes and metabolic syndrome. This connection indicates potential involvement in cardiovascular diseases, as the ablation of galectin-12 reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and promotes M2 macrophage polarization, which is associated with decreased atheroma formation in atherosclerosis models (Kruk2023Galectin).

In cancer, galectin-12 is significantly downregulated in several tumor types, including colon cancer, where it is suggested to act as a tumor suppressor. Its downregulation is associated with promoter hypermethylation, and re-expression can be induced by differentiation agents like butyrate. Galectin-12 interacts with the neutral amino acid exchanger SLC1A5, reducing glutamine uptake and affecting glutamine anaplerosis in colon cancer cells, which may inhibit tumor growth by modulating cellular metabolism (Katzenmaier2019Deciphering). High galectin-12 expression correlates with better survival and less invasive tumor properties in colorectal cancer (Katzenmaier2019Deciphering).

## Interactions
Galectin-12 (LGALS12) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes in colon cancer cells. It interacts with several proteins, including SLC1A5, SLC3A2, and PHGDH, which are crucial for cellular metabolism and tumor progression. The binding of Galectin-12 to SLC1A5 significantly suppresses glutamine uptake, impacting the anaplerotic flux of glutamine-derived alpha-ketoglutarate into the TCA cycle, a process essential for energy metabolism and macromolecule synthesis (Katzenmaier2019Deciphering). This interaction suggests that Galectin-12 acts as an inhibitor of glutaminolysis in colon cancer cells (Katzenmaier2019Deciphering).

Galectin-12 also interacts with VPS13C, which is involved in maintaining its protein stability, and DDX3X, which is associated with RNA metabolism. These interactions suggest a role for Galectin-12 in protein transport and cellular homeostasis (Katzenmaier2019Deciphering). Additionally, Galectin-12's interaction with cytoskeletal proteins TUBB2A and TUBB4A indicates its involvement in protein transport and cellular structure (Katzenmaier2019Deciphering). These interactions highlight Galectin-12's role as a modulator of tumor metabolism and its potential impact on cancer cell growth and survival.
