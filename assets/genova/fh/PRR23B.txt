# PRR23B

## Overview
PRR23B is a gene that encodes the proline-rich protein 23B, which is characterized by its abundance of proline residues. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. The proline-rich nature of the protein suggests potential roles in protein-protein interactions, as proline-rich motifs are often involved in signaling pathways and the formation of protein complexes. While the specific pathways and interactions involving proline-rich protein 23B are not yet comprehensively understood, ongoing research aims to clarify its role in cellular physiology and its potential implications in human health and disease.
