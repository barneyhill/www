# PPIL6

## Overview
PPIL6 is a gene that encodes the protein peptidylprolyl isomerase like 6, a member of the cyclophilin family of peptidyl-prolyl isomerases. These enzymes are known for their role in catalyzing the cis-trans isomerization of proline residues, a process vital for proper protein folding and function. Although PPIL6 shares structural similarities with other cyclophilins, such as a common fold architecture with eight antiparallel beta sheets and two alpha-helices, it exhibits unique features, including a distinct gatekeeper residue and loop structures that may influence its substrate specificity and molecular interactions (Davis2010Structural). Unlike other cyclophilins, PPIL6 does not bind cyclosporin A or tetrapeptide substrates, indicating a divergence in its active site and suggesting potentially different functional roles (Davis2010Structural). While the precise molecular function of PPIL6 remains unclear, it is hypothesized to act as a proline-binding domain, contributing to cellular processes such as protein conformation and stability within the cytoplasm and nucleus (Davis2010Structural).

## Structure
PPIL6 is a member of the cyclophilin family of peptidyl-prolyl isomerases, which are characterized by their ability to catalyze the cis-trans isomerization of proline residues in polypeptides. The molecular structure of PPIL6 has not been experimentally determined, but homology models suggest it shares structural characteristics with other cyclophilins, including a common fold architecture with eight antiparallel beta sheets and two alpha-helices (Davis2010Structural). 

PPIL6 features a unique gatekeeper residue, lysine at position 103, which differs from other cyclophilin isoforms and may influence substrate specificity (Davis2010Structural). The protein also has a full-length b1-b2 loop and a longer a1-b3 loop, which could affect its molecular interactions (Davis2010Structural). Despite these structural features, PPIL6 does not bind cyclosporin A or the tetrapeptide substrate, indicating divergence in its active site compared to other cyclophilins like PPIA (Davis2010Structural).

The molecular function of PPIL6 remains unclear, but it may still function as a proline-binding domain (Davis2010Structural). There is no specific information on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms for PPIL6 in the provided context.

## Function
PPIL6 (peptidylprolyl isomerase like 6) is a member of the cyclophilin family of peptidyl-prolyl isomerases, which are enzymes that catalyze the interconversion of cis and trans isomers of proline residues in proteins. This activity is crucial for protein folding and function. Despite its classification as a cyclophilin, PPIL6 does not bind cyclosporin A or tetrapeptide substrates, suggesting a divergence in its active site and potentially different functional roles compared to other cyclophilins (Davis2010Structural).

PPIL6 may function as a proline-binding domain, as it shows binding to the standard substrate suc-AGPF-pNA, despite lacking isomerase activity (Davis2010Structural). The molecular function of the PPIase domain in PPIL6 remains unknown, but structural data suggest potential roles in proline binding (Davis2010Structural). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to the regulation of protein conformation and stability, which are essential for various cellular processes such as signal transduction, protein trafficking, and immune response. However, specific functions of PPIL6 in healthy human cells have not been detailed in the available literature (Davis2010Structural).
