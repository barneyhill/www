# WNT3A

## Overview
WNT3A is a gene that encodes the protein Wnt family member 3A, which is a crucial component of the Wnt signaling pathway, particularly the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway. The WNT3A protein is categorized as a signaling molecule and is involved in various developmental processes and cellular functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. It plays a significant role in maintaining stem cell populations and regulating embryonic development, particularly in the formation of mesoderm and endoderm during gastrulation (Hay2008Highly; Boland2004Wnt). The protein's structure, characterized by post-translational modifications and interactions with receptors such as Frizzled and LRP5/6, is essential for its function in signal transduction (Kumar2014Molecular; Bourhis2010Reconstitution). Alterations in WNT3A expression or mutations in the gene have been linked to various pathological conditions, including cardiovascular diseases and developmental disorders (Greco1996Analysis; Ren2021WNT3A).

## Structure
The WNT3A protein is a member of the Wnt family, characterized by its complex molecular structure and significant role in signaling pathways. The primary structure of WNT3A includes a sequence of amino acids that undergo post-translational modifications, such as palmitoylation at a conserved serine residue (Ser209), which is crucial for its hydrophobic nature and membrane localization (Kumar2014Molecular; Zhong2021CryoEM). 

The secondary structure of WNT3A consists of several α-helices and β-strands, contributing to its overall stability and function (Zhong2021CryoEM). The tertiary structure is maintained by disulfide bonds, which are essential for stabilizing the protein's conformation and facilitating interactions with receptors like Frizzled8 (Fz8) (Kumar2014Molecular; Zhong2021CryoEM).

In terms of quaternary structure, WNT3A can form dimers, which are important for its signaling activity. The protein interacts with the Frizzled receptor through a cysteine-rich domain (CRD), forming a complex that is vital for Wnt/β-catenin signaling (Kumar2014Molecular). The interaction sites include a lipid group at Ser209 and a hydrophobic loop in the C-terminal domain, which are critical for effective signaling (Kumar2014Molecular). These structural features highlight the intricate design of WNT3A, enabling its role in developmental processes and cellular communication.

## Function
WNT3A is a critical component of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including cell fate determination, proliferation, and migration. In healthy human cells, WNT3A is involved in the regulation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), where it promotes proliferation and maintains these cells in an undifferentiated state by suppressing osteogenic differentiation. This is achieved through the stabilization and nuclear translocation of β-catenin, which activates specific gene transcription (Boland2004Wnt). 

WNT3A is also essential in the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into hepatic endoderm, a process crucial for liver development. It facilitates the transition through the primitive streak during gastrulation, which is necessary for mesoderm and endoderm formation (Hay2008Highly). In the intestinal epithelium, WNT3A maintains stem cell homeostasis by preserving the undifferentiated phenotype of intestinal stem cells, which is vital for rapid epithelial turnover (FerrerMayorga2019Vitamin). 

WNT3A is active at the cell membrane and in the extracellular space, where it binds to receptors to initiate signaling cascades that regulate gene expression and maintain tissue homeostasis (Działo2019WNT3a).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the WNT3A gene have been associated with several diseases and conditions. The WNT3A rs752107 polymorphism is linked to an increased risk of essential hypertension (EH) and related cardiovascular diseases, such as heart failure (HF) and ischemic stroke (IS). The T allele of this polymorphism is associated with a higher risk of these conditions compared to the C allele, which is linked to reduced WNT3A expression in the brain. This reduction potentially leads to the inactivation of the renin-angiotensin system, influencing hypertension pathophysiology (Ren2021WNT3A).

In the context of chronic kidney disease (CKD), WNT3A is involved in vascular calcification (VC) through the noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway. A reduction in secreted frizzled-related protein 5 (sFRP5) leads to the activation of Wnt3a-mediated Rho/ROCK/JNK signaling, contributing to the trans-differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells into osteoblast-like cells, a process associated with VC. This suggests that WNT3A plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of VC in CKD (Oh2020Reduction).

Additionally, WNT3A gene dosage is crucial for normal axial development in mice, with mutations leading to skeletal abnormalities and conditions such as spina bifida and caudal regression syndrome (Greco1996Analysis).

## Interactions
WNT3A is involved in several key interactions within the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. It binds to Frizzled (FZD) receptors and the co-receptor LRP5/6 to form a ternary signaling complex, which is essential for the activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway (Bourhis2010Reconstitution; Yokoyama2007Abundance). WNT3A shows promiscuous binding to multiple FZD isoforms, including FZD 1-8, and can induce β-catenin stabilization and phospho-LRP6 formation in the presence of these receptors (Dijksterhuis2015Systematic).

The interaction of WNT3A with LRP6 is particularly significant, as it binds to the E3E4 subdomain of LRP6, facilitating the formation of a signaling complex with Fz8 CRD (Bourhis2010Reconstitution). This interaction is crucial for the inhibition of β-catenin phosphorylation, preventing its degradation and promoting signal transduction (Yokoyama2007Abundance).

WNT3A also interacts with the protein Wntless (WLS), which is essential for its secretion and interaction with Frizzled receptors. This interaction involves several β-hairpin and loop regions of WNT3A, forming major interfaces with WLS (Zhong2021CryoEM). These interactions highlight the complex network of protein interactions that WNT3A participates in to regulate cellular signaling pathways.
