# SLC1A5

## Overview
SLC1A5 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 1 member 5 (SLC1A5), also known as ASCT2, which is a transmembrane sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter. This protein is integral to the transport and exchange of glutamine and other neutral amino acids across the plasma membrane, playing a vital role in maintaining amino acid homeostasis within human cells (Scalise2018The). SLC1A5 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, lung, and skeletal muscle, where it supports essential cellular functions such as protein synthesis, energy production, and signaling (Scalise2018The). The protein's structure is characterized by a homotrimeric formation, with each protomer consisting of distinct transport and scaffold domains that facilitate its function (Yu2019Structural). SLC1A5 is also implicated in several protein-protein interactions that influence its regulatory mechanisms and is of particular interest in cancer research due to its role in tumor metabolism and potential as a therapeutic target (van2015ASCT2SLC1A5; Xu2022SLC1A5).

## Structure
The SLC1A5 protein, also known as ASCT2, is a human glutamine transporter with a homotrimeric structure. Each protomer consists of two main domains: a transport domain and a scaffold domain, connected by the extracellular loop region 2 (ECL2a and ECL2b) (Yu2019Structural). The transport domain includes transmembrane helices TM3, TM6-TM8, and helical loops HP1-HP2, which are crucial for substrate binding and recognition (Yu2019CryoEM). The scaffold domain comprises TM1-TM2 and TM4-TM5, forming a compact core that interacts with the transport domain (Yu2019CryoEM).

The protein operates as a homotrimer, with each protomer contributing to the overall structure and function. The scaffold domains provide the trimer interface and remain relatively static, while the transport domains undergo significant conformational changes during the transport cycle (Garaeva2019A). The SLC1A5 transporter exhibits a GltPH-like fold, which is common among members of the SLC1 family (Yu2019Structural).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, may affect the activity and stability of SLC1A5, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. The presence of splice variant isoforms is suggested, potentially leading to different functional properties (Scalise2018The).

## Function
The SLC1A5 gene encodes the ASCT2 protein, a sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter primarily involved in the uptake and exchange of glutamine and other neutral amino acids across the plasma membrane. ASCT2 plays a crucial role in maintaining amino acid homeostasis in human cells, supporting cellular functions such as protein synthesis, energy production, and signaling (Scalise2018The). It operates as a Na+-dependent antiporter, facilitating the exchange of glutamine with other neutral amino acids like serine, asparagine, and threonine, which is essential for regulating amino acid pools in intra- and extracellular spaces (Scalise2019Interaction; Scalise2018The).

ASCT2 is expressed in various tissues, including the lung, skeletal muscle, large intestine, kidney, testis, T-cells, brain, and adipose tissue, where it plays a significant role in cell biology by maintaining amino acid balance, crucial for cellular metabolism and signaling (Scalise2018The). In the brain, ASCT2 is involved in the glutamine/glutamate cycle, facilitating the recycling of glutamate from the synaptic cleft in astrocytes and its re-synthesis in neurons, which is vital for neurotransmitter production (Scalise2018The). The transporter also interacts with various proteins, influencing its function and regulation, and is involved in broader cellular processes through these interactions (Scalise2018The).

## Clinical Significance
The SLC1A5 gene, also known as ASCT2, plays a significant role in various cancers due to its involvement in glutamine transport, which is crucial for cancer cell metabolism and growth. In pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), high SLC1A5 expression is associated with poor prognosis and is considered an independent prognostic factor. It is linked to advanced clinical stages and unfavorable survival outcomes, including overall and progression-free survival (Xu2022SLC1A5). SLC1A5 overexpression in PAAD is also associated with the suppression of antitumor immune processes by altering immune cell infiltration levels, which can affect the efficacy of certain therapeutic agents (Xu2022SLC1A5).

In triple-negative basal-like breast cancer, SLC1A5 is crucial for tumor growth, with its knockdown leading to reduced tumor size and increased survival in experimental models. This suggests its potential as a therapeutic target (van2015ASCT2SLC1A5). In epithelial ovarian cancer, SLC1A5 positivity is linked to a lower rate of recurrent disease and improved disease-free survival, indicating its potential role in prognostic assessments (Bjersand2017The). Overall, SLC1A5's expression and function have significant implications for cancer progression and therapy.

## Interactions
The SLC1A5 protein, also known as ASCT2, is involved in several significant protein-protein interactions that influence its function and regulation. It interacts with CD147/MCT1 and CD98/LAT1, which are involved in metabolic regulation by mTOR (Scalise2018The). ASCT2 also physically interacts with PDZK1, a scaffold protein that regulates various SLC members, through a class I PDZ binding domain (Scalise2018The). SNX27 binds to ASCT2, enhancing its stability in the plasma membrane and is involved in the trafficking of GPCRs and GLUT1 to the plasma membrane (Scalise2018The). 

In the context of cancer biology, ASCT2 has been reported to interact with the serotonin transporter (SERT), potentially playing a role in neuronal homeostasis, and with EGFR, aligning with its regulation by EGF (Scalise2018The). SLC1A5 also interacts with SLC38A2, another glutamine transporter, on the plasma membrane. This interaction was identified using proximity-labeling proteomics and confirmed by a BiFC assay (Huang2020SLC38A2). The interaction between SLC1A5 and SLC38A2 is significant in cancer metabolism, as their co-overexpression is associated with poor cancer prognosis (Huang2020SLC38A2).
