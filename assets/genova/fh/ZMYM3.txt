# ZMYM3

## Overview
ZMYM3 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger MYM-type containing 3 protein, a transcriptional coregulator involved in DNA repair and chromatin remodeling. The protein is characterized by its MYM-type zinc finger domains, which facilitate DNA binding and protein-protein interactions, playing a crucial role in the DNA damage response (DDR) by promoting homologous recombination (HR) repair. ZMYM3 is rapidly recruited to DNA double-strand breaks, where it interacts with components of the BRCA1-A complex, essential for the localization and function of BRCA1 at damage sites. The protein's interactions with the CoREST histone-modifying complex and RNase H2B further underscore its role in chromatin remodeling and genomic stability. Mutations in ZMYM3 have been linked to various cancers and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining proper cellular function and genome integrity (Hiatt2022Deleterious; Leung2017ZMYM3).

## Structure
The ZMYM3 protein is a 1370-amino acid transcriptional coregulator characterized by the presence of MYM-type zinc finger domains, which are crucial for its function in DNA binding and protein-protein interactions (Hiatt2022Deleterious; Leung2017ZMYM3). It contains 10 tandem zinc finger domains, with specific zinc fingers playing distinct roles in binding to various proteins. For instance, zinc finger domains 8 and 9 interact with components of the CoREST histone-modifying complex, while zinc finger domain 1 is necessary for binding to the transcription factor GTFII-I (ShapsonCoe2019Aicardi–Goutières).

The protein also includes a proline-rich region and a C-terminal Cre-Like domain, with the C-terminal region containing a 'PXP' motif important for interaction with RNase H2B (ShapsonCoe2019Aicardi–Goutières; Hiatt2022Deleterious). The N-terminal 300 amino acids are crucial for chromatin interaction and recruitment to DNA damage sites, highlighting its role in the DNA damage response (Leung2017ZMYM3).

ZMYM3 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its function and interactions. The protein exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can affect its structural and functional properties (Hiatt2022Deleterious).

## Function
The ZMYM3 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the DNA damage response (DDR) by promoting DNA repair through homologous recombination (HR) in healthy human cells. ZMYM3 is a chromatin-interacting protein that is rapidly recruited to sites of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) marked by γH2AX, where it facilitates the localization of the HR factor BRCA1 to damaged chromatin (Leung2017ZMYM3). It interacts with components of the BRCA1-A complex, such as ABRA1 and RAP80, which is essential for the proper function and localization of BRCA1 at DNA damage sites (Leung2017ZMYM3).

ZMYM3's interaction with chromatin is dependent on its binding to histone proteins H2A/H2AX within the nucleosome, and its recruitment to damaged chromatin is crucial for efficient HR repair and cell cycle checkpoint regulation following DNA damage (Leung2017ZMYM3). The protein's role in DDR is specific to HR, as it does not affect non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) (Leung2017ZMYM3). ZMYM3's function is vital for maintaining genome stability, and its deficiency leads to impaired HR repair and increased sensitivity to DNA damage (Vilas2018Caught; Leung2017ZMYM3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ZMYM3 gene have been linked to a variety of diseases and conditions. ZMYM3 is associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders. Deleterious variants in ZMYM3 have been identified in individuals with neurodevelopmental delay, often presenting with developmental delay, intellectual disability, and behavioral abnormalities. These variants are mostly missense and affect conserved sites, potentially damaging protein structure or function (Hiatt2022Deleterious).

ZMYM3 mutations have also been implicated in several cancers, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, medulloblastoma, Ewing sarcoma, and prostate cancer. These mutations are often predicted to be loss-of-function, affecting interactions with other proteins involved in DNA repair (Kudo2021ZMYM3; Leung2017ZMYM3).

In psychiatric disorders, variations in the ZMYM3 gene, particularly in its 5′ untranslated region, have been associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. These variations may influence gene expression and contribute to the pathogenesis of these conditions (Afshar2020Evolving; Alizadeh2019Diseaseonly).

ZMYM3 is also considered a candidate gene for Alzheimer's disease, with reduced expression levels observed in severe cases, suggesting its involvement in cognitive disorders (Afshar2020Evolving).

## Interactions
ZMYM3 is a chromatin-associated protein that plays a significant role in DNA repair and transcriptional regulation through its interactions with various proteins and nucleic acids. It is a crucial component of the BRCA1-A complex, interacting directly with members such as RAP80, ABRA1, and BRE. These interactions are essential for the recruitment of ABRA1 and BRCA1 to sites of DNA damage, facilitating homologous recombination repair (Leung2017ZMYM3). ZMYM3 binds to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and H2A/H2AX histone proteins, accumulating at DNA damage sites to promote repair processes (Leung2017ZMYM3).

ZMYM3 also interacts with the CoREST histone-modifying complex, which includes HDAC2, KDM1A, and RCOR1. This interaction is mediated by its zinc finger domains and a proline-rich region, playing a role in chromatin remodeling and gene silencing (ShapsonCoe2019Aicardi–Goutières). Additionally, ZMYM3 interacts with RNase H2B, a component of the ribonucleotide excision repair pathway, suggesting a role in coordinating chromatin remodeling and DNA repair (ShapsonCoe2019Aicardi–Goutières).

Mutations in ZMYM3 have been associated with various cancers and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting the importance of its interactions in maintaining genomic stability and proper cellular function (Vilas2018Caught; Hiatt2022Deleterious).
