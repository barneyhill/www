# TAB2

## Overview
TAB2, or TGF-beta activated kinase 1 (MAP3K7) binding protein 2, is a gene that encodes an adaptor protein involved in critical cellular signaling pathways, particularly those related to inflammation and immune responses. The protein encoded by TAB2 is characterized by its coiled-coil structure and a C-terminal Npl4 zinc-finger (NZF) domain, which facilitates interactions with polyubiquitin chains. Functionally, TAB2 is integral to the activation of TAK1, a MAP kinase kinase kinase, by linking it to TRAF6 in the IL-1 signaling pathway, thereby promoting the activation of downstream transcription factors such as NF-κB and MAPK. Beyond its role in inflammation, TAB2 is implicated in the regulation of autophagy and is subject to various post-translational modifications that influence its stability and activity. Clinically, mutations in the TAB2 gene are associated with congenital heart defects and cardiomyopathy, underscoring its importance in cardiovascular development and function (Thienpont2010Haploinsufficiency; Takaesu2000TAB2; Kanayama2004TAB2; Yin2022TAB2).

## Structure
TAB2 is a protein composed of 693 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 77 kDa. A distinctive feature of TAB2 is its coiled-coil structure, specifically an amphipathic α helix formed by amino acids 535-609, which is crucial for its interaction with TAK1 (Takaesu2000TAB2). The C-terminal domain of TAB2 contains a Npl4 zinc-finger (NZF) domain, which is involved in binding K63-linked and K6-linked polyubiquitin chains. This domain coordinates a zinc ion with four cysteine residues and interacts with ubiquitin via a conserved TFF motif (Li2021Structural).

Post-translational modifications of TAB2 include SUMOylation at Lys329, which negatively regulates TAK1 activation, and ubiquitination, which can lead to proteasome-dependent degradation (Hirata2017PostTranslational). Phosphorylation events have been identified at Ser372 and Ser524, although their functional roles are not fully understood (Hirata2017PostTranslational).

TAB2 is known to have splice variant isoforms, which may result in proteins with distinct functions, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context. The protein's structure and modifications play significant roles in its function within signal transduction pathways.

## Function
TAB2 (TGF-beta activated kinase 1 (MAP3K7) binding protein 2) functions as an adaptor protein that plays a crucial role in several signaling pathways, particularly those involved in inflammation and immune responses. In healthy human cells, TAB2 is integral to the activation of TAK1, a MAP kinase kinase kinase, by linking it to TRAF6 in the IL-1 signaling pathway. This interaction is essential for the activation of downstream signaling molecules such as NF-κB and MAPK, which are key transcription factors in the inflammatory response (Takaesu2000TAB2; Kanayama2004TAB2).

TAB2 is also involved in the regulation of autophagy. It interacts with Beclin1 and ATG5, suggesting a role in autophagy regulation near the isolation membrane. Overexpression of TAB2 induces a punctate localization of ATG5, indicating its involvement in autophagy processes (Takaesu2011TGF).

In the context of NF-κB signaling, TAB2 binds to K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, facilitating the activation of TAK1 and IKK, which are upstream kinases in the NF-κB pathway. This process is crucial for cellular responses to stress and cytokines (Kanayama2004TAB2). Additionally, TAB2 is subject to post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination and SUMOylation, which regulate its stability and activity in signaling pathways (Hirata2017PostTranslational).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TAB2 gene are associated with several cardiovascular conditions, particularly congenital heart defects (CHDs) and cardiomyopathy. Haploinsufficiency of TAB2 has been linked to CHDs, including outflow tract defects, atrial septum defects, and ventricular septal defects. These defects are attributed to the gene's dosage-sensitive role in heart development, as demonstrated in both human and animal studies (Thienpont2010Haploinsufficiency). 

In addition to CHDs, TAB2 mutations are implicated in dilated cardiomyopathy. TAB2 deficiency promotes receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1)-dependent apoptosis and necroptosis, leading to myocardial remodeling and heart failure (Yin2022TAB2). The absence of TAB2 increases susceptibility to myocardial injury and adverse remodeling under stress, highlighting its protective role in cardiac tissue (Yin2022TAB2).

TAB2 variants are also associated with a syndrome characterized by mitral valve disease, cardiomyopathy, short stature, and hypermobility. This syndrome shares features with Noonan Syndrome and RASopathies, due to TAB2's involvement in the MAPK pathway (Engwerda2021TAB2). The clinical presentation of TAB2-related conditions can vary, with some cases exhibiting additional features like dysmorphic facial characteristics and connective tissue abnormalities (Engwerda2021TAB2).

## Interactions
TAB2 is a key adaptor protein involved in various protein-protein interactions within signaling pathways. It plays a crucial role in the IL-1 signal transduction pathway by mediating the activation of TAK1 kinase through its interaction with TRAF6. TAB2 binds to TRAF6 via its C-terminal domain, facilitating the activation of TAK1, which is essential for NF-κB and JNK pathway activation (Takaesu2000TAB2).

TAB2 also interacts with NUMBL, a protein that inhibits TNFα and IL-1β-induced NF-κB activation. This interaction is mediated by the PTB domain of NUMBL and the C-terminal region of TAB2, highlighting its role in negatively regulating NF-κB signaling (Ma2008NUMBL).

In the context of autophagy, TAB2 interacts with Beclin1 and ATG13, and is phosphorylated by ULK1. These interactions suggest a regulatory role in autophagy, independent of TAK1 activity (Takaesu2011TGF).

TAB2's NZF domain specifically binds to K63- and K6-linked polyubiquitin chains, which is crucial for its function in cellular signaling pathways. This interaction is mediated by specific residues in the NZF domain, providing insights into its role in ubiquitin-mediated signaling (Kulathu2009Twosided; Li2021Structural).
