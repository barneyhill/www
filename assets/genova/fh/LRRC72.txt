# LRRC72

## Overview
LRRC72 is a gene that encodes the protein leucine-rich repeat-containing 72, which is characterized by the presence of leucine-rich repeat motifs. These motifs are typically involved in protein-protein interactions, suggesting that LRRC72 may play a role in various cellular processes. The protein is implicated in the function of ciliary structures, particularly in the central apparatus of the sperm axoneme, where it interacts with other proteins such as CFAP54 and PPP1CC, indicating a potential role in regulating ciliary motility (Zhu2024Incell). Additionally, LRRC72 has been observed to be upregulated in the coral species Montipora foliosa, suggesting a possible involvement in innate immune responses (Han2023Comparative). Despite these associations, the full spectrum of LRRC72's functions and interactions remains to be fully elucidated, necessitating further research to understand its biological significance.

## Structure


## Interactions
LRRC72, or leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 72, is involved in various protein interactions, although specific details about these interactions are limited. In the context of mammalian sperm axoneme, LRRC72 interacts with CFAP54, a protein that encases calmodulin and binds to PPP1CC, suggesting a role in the central apparatus (CA) function of ciliary structures (Zhu2024Incell). This interaction indicates that LRRC72 may be part of a complex involved in regulating ciliary motility, potentially through interactions with other proteins in the CA.

In a different context, LRRC72 is noted for its upregulation in the coral species Montipora foliosa, where it is implicated in innate immunity. Although specific protein interactions are not detailed, its upregulation suggests a role in immune response pathways (Han2023Comparative).

Despite these insights, the precise molecular interactions and functions of LRRC72 remain largely unexplored. Further research is needed to elucidate its role in protein complexes and its potential regulatory interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids. The current understanding is based on its association with other proteins in specific biological contexts, highlighting the need for more comprehensive studies.
