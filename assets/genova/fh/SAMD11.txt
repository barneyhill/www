# SAMD11

## Overview
SAMD11 is a gene that encodes the protein sterile alpha motif domain containing 11, which is characterized by the presence of a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain. This domain is a common protein interaction module involved in signal transduction and transcriptional regulation. The SAMD11 protein is highly conserved across species, from zebrafish to humans, underscoring its evolutionary significance (Corton2016Identification). It is predominantly expressed in the retina, where it plays a crucial role in the differentiation and maintenance of photoreceptor cells, particularly rods. Functionally, SAMD11 acts as a transcriptional co-repressor, potentially influencing CRX-mediated transcription, which is essential for photoreceptor differentiation and survival (Corton2016Identification). The protein is also part of the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) in photoreceptor cells, contributing to the establishment of rod photoreceptor identity through epigenetic regulation (Kubo2021Functional). Mutations in the SAMD11 gene have been associated with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa, highlighting its clinical significance in retinal health (Corton2016Identification).

## Structure
The SAMD11 protein is characterized by the presence of a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, which is a common protein interaction module involved in signal transduction and transcriptional regulation. The SAM domain typically forms a small 4-5-helix bundle of two orthogonally packed α-hairpins, allowing for homo- and hetero-oligomerization, which facilitates various self-association architectures (Corton2016Identification). The SAMD11 protein is highly conserved from zebrafish to humans, indicating its evolutionary importance (Corton2016Identification).

The human SAMD11 protein is encoded by a reference transcript containing 14 exons, resulting in a protein composed of 681 amino acids with an apparent molecular weight of 68 kDa (Corton2016Identification). The protein is widely expressed in human tissues, with notable expression in the retina, where it is found in the outer and inner nuclear layers, ganglion cell layer, and photoreceptor cells (Corton2016Identification).

The C-terminal region of SAMD11 is crucial for its function as a transcriptional repressor, although it lacks a direct DNA binding domain. This repressive activity is not due to SAM interactions but is attributed to the conserved C-terminal region, which is lost in patients with retinitis pigmentosa carrying a truncating mutation (Corton2016Identification).

## Function
SAMD11 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the differentiation and maintenance of photoreceptor cells, particularly in the retina. The protein is characterized by the presence of a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions crucial for signal transduction and transcriptional regulation (Corton2016Identification). SAMD11 is predominantly expressed in the retina, with localization in the outer nuclear layer where rod photoreceptor cell bodies reside, suggesting its role in rod photoreceptor function (Corton2016Identification). 

In healthy human cells, SAMD11 is thought to act as a transcriptional co-repressor, potentially influencing CRX-mediated transcription, which is vital for photoreceptor differentiation and survival (Corton2016Identification). The protein's expression pattern correlates with rod development and maturation, indicating its involvement in maintaining photoreceptor structure and function (Corton2016Identification). SAMD11 is also part of the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) in photoreceptor cells, contributing to the establishment of rod photoreceptor identity through epigenetic regulation (Kubo2021Functional). This role is crucial for maintaining precise gene expression necessary for proper retinal function and morphology (Kubo2021Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SAMD11 gene have been linked to autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a form of inherited retinal dystrophy characterized by progressive photoreceptor degeneration. The study by Corton et al. identified a novel homozygous nonsense mutation, p.Arg630*, in SAMD11, which introduces a premature termination codon, leading to the truncation of the protein's C-terminal domain. This mutation was found in multiple patients from unrelated families, suggesting its role in the pathogenesis of RP (Corton2016Identification). Patients with this mutation typically experience night blindness, followed by progressive constriction of the visual field and eventual loss of visual acuity (Corton2016Identification).

The SAMD11 gene is expressed predominantly in the retina, particularly in rod photoreceptor cell bodies, and is believed to play a crucial role in photoreceptor differentiation and survival. The loss of the C-terminal domain due to the mutation impairs its function as a transcriptional repressor, which is critical for maintaining retinal function (Corton2016Identification). Although SAMD11 is also associated with other conditions, such as autism spectrum disorders, the specific phenotype related to RP does not include autistic behavior (Corton2016Identification).

## Interactions
SAMD11 is involved in several protein interactions, particularly within the retina. It is suggested to function as a transcriptional repressor, potentially interacting with transcription factors such as CRX and OTX2, which are crucial for photoreceptor differentiation and survival (Corton2016Identification). SAMD11 is also part of the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) in photoreceptor cells, where it interacts with Phc2 and Samd7. This interaction is important for establishing rod photoreceptor identity (Kubo2021Functional). 

In the context of retinal development, SAMD11 forms homophilic interactions with itself and heterophilic interactions with Samd7, as confirmed by immunoprecipitation assays (Kubo2021Functional). These interactions suggest a role in maintaining normal rod photoreceptor function and gene expression in the retina (Kubo2021Functional). 

Additionally, SAMD11 is part of a protein network with a high clustering coefficient, indicating interactions with several retinal dystrophy-associated genes, including CRX (Corton2016Identification). These interactions highlight SAMD11's potential role in retinal health and function, particularly in the context of retinitis pigmentosa.
