# OR10J5

## Overview
OR10J5 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 10 subfamily J member 5, which is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This receptor is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure, a hallmark of GPCRs, and is primarily involved in olfactory signal transduction. However, OR10J5 also plays significant roles beyond olfaction, particularly in lipid metabolism and vascular health. The receptor is activated by compounds such as α-cedrene, which influences lipid metabolism in human hepatocytes through the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway, and lyral, which is associated with allergic contact dermatitis (Wang2020Simulative; Tong2017Olfactory). OR10J5's expression in various tissues, including non-olfactory sites, suggests its involvement in diverse physiological processes, including angiogenesis and lipid homeostasis (Zhang2020Computerized; Oh1970SystemWide).

## Structure
The olfactory receptor OR10J5 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure, typical of this receptor family (Tong2017Olfactory). The primary structure of OR10J5 includes specific amino acid residues that are crucial for its function, particularly in the transmembrane and extracellular loop regions, which are involved in ligand binding (Wang2020Simulative). The secondary structure is likely to include alpha-helices, as is common in GPCRs, facilitating the formation of the transmembrane domains.

The tertiary structure of OR10J5 has been modeled using homology modeling techniques, with bovine rhodopsin serving as a template due to its structural similarity (Wang2020Simulative). This modeling approach helps predict the receptor's folding and the arrangement of its transmembrane helices, which are essential for its function. The receptor's binding cavity is described as large and hydrophobic, which is significant for its interaction with ligands such as α-cedrene and lyral (Tong2017Olfactory).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, are common in olfactory receptors and may influence OR10J5's function and localization, although specific modifications for OR10J5 are not detailed in the provided context. The receptor is expressed in various tissues, indicating its potential roles beyond olfaction (Tong2017Olfactory).

## Function
OR10J5 is an olfactory receptor that plays a significant role in regulating lipid metabolism in human hepatocytes. It is activated by α-cedrene, a natural compound, which leads to a reduction in triglyceride concentration in liver cells through the Adcy-cAMP pathway. This activation results in increased intracellular cAMP levels and a dose-dependent decline in lipid accumulation. The effects of α-cedrene are mediated by the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway, as evidenced by changes in protein and mRNA expression profiles related to lipid metabolism, including increased levels of Adcy3, PKA Cα, phosphor-CREB, phosphor-AMPK, and phosphor-HSL, and decreased expression of lipogenic genes (Tong2017Olfactory).

OR10J5 is also expressed in various non-olfactory tissues, such as the human aorta, coronary artery, and umbilical vein endothelial cells, where it may play roles in angiogenesis and other physiological processes (Zhang2020Computerized; Oh1970SystemWide). The receptor's involvement in these processes suggests its potential importance in maintaining lipid homeostasis and vascular health. The knockdown of OR10J5 negates the lipid-lowering effects of α-cedrene, underscoring its crucial role in these cellular functions (Tong2017Olfactory).

## Clinical Significance
The olfactory receptor OR10J5 has been implicated in several conditions related to its expression and interactions. Alterations in OR10J5 expression or function have been linked to metabolic disorders, particularly those involving lipid metabolism, such as hepatic steatosis. Activation of OR10J5 by α-cedrene has been shown to reduce triglyceride concentration and hepatic lipid content, suggesting a protective role against hepatic steatosis through the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway (Tong2017Olfactory). Knockdown of OR10J5 in human hepatocytes leads to increased lipid accumulation, indicating its crucial role in regulating lipid metabolism (Tong2017Olfactory).

OR10J5 is also involved in the interaction with environmental chemicals like Lyral, which can lead to contact dermatitis. The binding of Lyral to OR10J5 involves specific amino acid residues, potentially resulting in conformational changes and adverse dermal effects (Zhang2020Computerized; Wang2020Simulative). While OR10J5's role in obesity is not directly established, variations in olfactory receptor genes, including OR10J5, have been associated with extreme obesity, possibly affecting food intake behaviors through olfactory perception (Mariman2015Olfactory). These findings suggest that OR10J5 may have broader implications in health and disease beyond its traditional role in olfaction.

## Interactions
The olfactory receptor OR10J5 interacts with various compounds, leading to significant downstream signaling effects. It binds to the fragrance compound lyral, which can cause allergic contact dermatitis. This interaction involves specific amino acid residues such as Phe104, Val105, Cyx178, Ile180, and Tyr258, and may result in conformational changes in the receptor. These changes can lead to increased calcium levels and enhanced phosphorylation of AKT, which are associated with angiogenesis (Beito2024Role; Wang2020Simulative).

OR10J5 also interacts with α-cedrene, a compound that activates the receptor and influences lipid metabolism. This interaction is mediated through the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway, which is crucial for regulating hepatic lipid homeostasis. Activation of OR10J5 by α-cedrene leads to increased cAMP levels, which subsequently activate PKA. This activation results in the phosphorylation of proteins such as AMPK, CREB, and HSL, affecting lipid metabolism and reducing triglyceride concentration in HepG2 cells (Tong2017Olfactory).

The receptor's activation by α-cedrene also involves increased expression of genes related to fatty acid oxidation and downregulation of lipogenic genes, highlighting its role in lipid regulation (Tong2017Olfactory).
