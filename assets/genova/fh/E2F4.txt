# E2F4

## Overview
E2F4 is a gene that encodes the E2F transcription factor 4, a member of the E2F family of transcription factors, which are pivotal in regulating the cell cycle and DNA replication. The E2F4 protein is characterized as a transcription factor, primarily functioning as a repressor of gene expression during the G1 phase of the cell cycle. It achieves this by forming complexes with retinoblastoma (pRB) family proteins, such as p107 and p130, to repress genes necessary for the G1/S phase transition (Ren2002E2F). Unlike other E2F family members, E2F4 lacks a nuclear localization signal, which influences its regulatory mechanisms and cellular localization (Müller1997Induction). E2F4 is involved in various protein interactions, including those with DP family proteins, which enhance its DNA-binding and transcriptional activities (Ginsberg1994E2F4). Clinically, alterations in the E2F4 gene have been implicated in several diseases, including colorectal and breast cancers, as well as neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease, underscoring its significance in both normal cellular function and disease pathology (LópezSánchez2022A; PAQUIN2013Functional; Khaleel2014E2F4).

## Structure
E2F4 is a member of the E2F transcription factor family, characterized by a DNA-binding domain located in the amino-terminal half of the protein. This domain spans residues 12-81 and adopts a winged-helix fold, a common motif for DNA-binding proteins, consisting of three α helices and a β sheet that contribute to a compact hydrophobic core (Zheng1999Structural; Ginsberg1994E2F4). The DNA-binding domain of E2F4 is crucial for its interaction with DNA, specifically recognizing a palindromic CGCGCG sequence (Zheng1999Structural).

E2F4 also contains a hydrophobic heptad repeat involved in dimerization, necessary for forming both E2F homodimers and E2F-DP heterodimers (Zheng1999Structural). The protein forms heterodimers with DP family members, enhancing its DNA-binding and transactivating functions (Ginsberg1994E2F4). The heterodimerization interface between E2F4 and DP2 is predominantly hydrophobic, involving the α1 and α3 helices from both proteins (Zheng1999Structural).

E2F4 lacks a nuclear localization signal, which distinguishes it from other E2F family members and affects its regulatory mechanisms (Müller1997Induction). It is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may regulate its activity and interactions (Ginsberg1994E2F4). E2F4 also has splice variant isoforms, which may differ in their regulatory functions.

## Function
E2F4 is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in regulating the cell cycle in healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in the repression of genes during the G1 phase by forming complexes with retinoblastoma (pRB) family proteins, such as p107 and p130, which leads to the repression of genes activated at the G1/S phase transition (Ren2002E2F). E2F4 is active in the nucleus during the G0 and early G1 phases, where it binds to promoters of genes involved in cell cycle control, DNA replication, and DNA repair (Ren2002E2F).

In quiescent cells, E2F4 binding is associated with reduced histone acetylation and gene repression, particularly in conjunction with p130 (Ren2002E2F). E2F4 also plays a role in the transcriptional coregulation of components involved in DNA damage repair and checkpoint responses, highlighting its involvement in maintaining genomic stability (Ren2002E2F). Although primarily a repressor, E2F4 can activate transcription under certain conditions, such as during the late G1/S phase (Ren2002E2F). This dual role underscores its importance in coordinating cell cycle progression with DNA repair and replication processes (Ren2002E2F).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the E2F4 gene have significant clinical implications in various diseases. In colorectal cancer, mutations in the E2F4 gene, particularly in the CAG trinucleotide repeat region, are associated with microsatellite instability (MSI). These mutations lead to increased transcriptional activity and protein stability, contributing to tumor progression by enhancing the growth capabilities of cancer cells (PAQUIN2013Functional). 

In breast cancer, E2F4's regulatory activity is a predictor of patient survival outcomes. Higher E2F4 activity scores correlate with shorter survival times, indicating a worse prognosis. This activity is particularly relevant in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers, suggesting a role in steroid-dependent cancers (Khaleel2014E2F4).

E2F4 is also implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). A mutant variant, E2F4DN, has shown therapeutic effects in AD models by reducing neuroinflammation and cognitive impairments. This variant modulates pathways related to synaptic function and metabolism, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for AD (LópezSánchez2022A). 

Overall, E2F4 mutations and altered expression levels are linked to the progression of several cancers and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its importance in clinical research and potential therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
E2F4, a member of the E2F family of transcription factors, is involved in various protein interactions that regulate cell cycle progression and transcriptional activity. E2F4 primarily interacts with pocket proteins such as p107 and p130. In vivo, E2F4 preferentially associates with p107, forming a complex that is transcriptionally inactive, thereby suppressing E2F4-mediated trans-activation (Beijersbergen1994E2F4). This interaction is distinct from other E2F family members like E2F-1, which primarily associates with the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) (Beijersbergen1994E2F4).

E2F4 also forms complexes with DP proteins, such as DP-1, which are essential for its DNA binding and transcriptional activation capabilities. The E2F4/DP-1 dimer can synergistically activate transcription from promoters containing E2F DNA-binding sites (Beijersbergen1994E2F4). In resting T cells, E2F4 is part of a complex with p130 and a DP family member, indicating its role in different cellular contexts (Vairo1995Functional).

E2F4's interactions extend to chromatin-modifying complexes, where it recruits components like the SAGA complex to mediate transcriptional activation in mouse embryonic stem cells (Hsu2019E2F4). These interactions highlight E2F4's role in both activating and repressing transcription, depending on the cellular environment and the presence of specific cofactors.
