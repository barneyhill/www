# CDC42BPB

## Overview
The CDC42BPB gene encodes the protein CDC42 binding protein kinase beta, commonly referred to as MRCKβ, which is a serine/threonine kinase. This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the actin-myosin cytoskeleton, influencing cell shape, motility, and division. MRCKβ functions as a downstream effector of the small GTPase CDC42, facilitating cytoskeletal reorganization and cell migration through its kinase activity. The protein is characterized by several functional domains, including a protein kinase domain, a cysteine-rich C1 domain, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a citron homology (CNH) domain, and a P21-binding domain (PBD or CRIB), which enable its interactions with other proteins and intracellular localization (Chilton2020De). MRCKβ is implicated in various cellular processes and has been associated with clinical conditions such as neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Unbekandt2019The; Pires2023Analysis).

## Structure
CDC42BPB encodes the protein MRCKβ, a serine/threonine kinase involved in cytoskeletal reorganization and cell migration. The protein is 1,711 amino acids long and contains several functional domains: the N-terminal protein kinase domain, a cysteine-rich C1 domain, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a citron homology (CNH) domain, and a P21-binding domain (PBD or CRIB) (Chilton2020De). These domains facilitate interactions with diacylglycerol-like phorbol esters and small GTPases like CDC42, influencing intracellular localization and protein interactions (Chilton2020De).

The tertiary structure of CDC42BPB, particularly from amino acids 451 to 990, is predominantly composed of α-helices forming a 'U' type domain. The R671 residue, located at the hinge of two α-helices, is significant for its role in determining electrostatic potential (Luo2020Sequence). A mutation at this site, R671Q, affects hydrogen bonding and electrostatic potential, potentially impacting protein stabilization and interactions (Luo2020Sequence).

Post-translational modifications include phosphorylation, notably of the myosin II regulatory light chain (MLC2), which is crucial for the protein's role in actin-myosin regulation (Chilton2020De). The coiled-coil region contains a ligand inhibitory motif (LIM) that autoregulates kinase function (Chilton2020De).

## Function
The CDC42BPB gene encodes the protein MRCKβ, a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in the regulation of the actin-myosin cytoskeleton, which is essential for cell shape, motility, and division (Unbekandt2019The). MRCKβ functions as a downstream effector of the small GTPase CDC42, which is involved in various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal reorganization and cell migration (Chilton2020De). The protein achieves this by phosphorylating the myosin II regulatory light chain (MLC2), leading to myosin activation and actin-myosin filament contraction (Unbekandt2019The).

MRCKβ contains several domains, including a protein kinase domain, a cysteine-rich C1 domain, a plekstrin homology (PH) domain, a citron homology domain (CNH), and a P21-binding domain (PBD, also known as CRIB) (Chilton2020De). These domains facilitate intracellular localization, macromolecular interactions, and binding to GTP-bound CDC42 or Rho-like small GTPases (Chilton2020De). The kinase domain is responsible for the phosphorylation of serine/threonine residues on target proteins, which is essential for actin-myosin regulation (Chilton2020De).

MRCKβ is expressed at higher levels than its close relative MRCKα, suggesting a more prominent role in both healthy and diseased tissues (Unbekandt2019The). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and is essential for maintaining cellular structure and function (Pichaud2019Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CDC42BPB gene are associated with several clinical conditions. Heterozygous de novo missense and loss-of-function variants in CDC42BPB have been linked to a neurodevelopmental phenotype, including Takenouchi-Kosaki syndrome. This autosomal dominant disorder is characterized by delayed psychomotor development, intellectual disability, dysmorphic facial features, and various organ defects. Patients with these mutations often exhibit developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism, hypotonia, and structural brain abnormalities such as cerebellar vermis hypoplasia and agenesis or hypoplasia of the corpus callosum (Chilton2020De).

In another study, a rare homozygous variant in CDC42BPB was identified in a family with three sisters affected by septate uterus, a type of Müllerian duct anomaly. This variant, CDC42BPB:c.2012G>A:p.R671Q, was suggested to be pathogenic and potentially involved in the pathogenesis of septate uterus, which is associated with poor reproductive outcomes and a high rate of miscarriage (Luo2020Sequence).

Additionally, CDC42BPB has been identified as a recurrently mutated gene in osteosarcoma samples, suggesting a potential role in cancer development and progression (Pires2023Analysis).

## Interactions
CDC42BPB, also known as MRCKβ, is a serine/threonine kinase that interacts with various proteins, playing a significant role in cytoskeletal organization and cell migration. It acts as an effector kinase for the small GTPase CDC42, forming a complex with tight junction protein ZO-1 (TJP1) upon binding with CDC42. This complex is targeted to the leading edge of migrating cells, where TJP1 serves as a scaffolding protein linking cell surface receptors to the actin cytoskeleton (Mathiesen2020The).

CDC42BPB is also involved in the syndecan-2 interactome, where it connects with CDC42, facilitating syndecan-2 mediated filopodia extensions. This interaction suggests a role in cytoskeletal rearrangements and possibly angiogenesis (Mathiesen2020The). Additionally, CDC42BPB has been identified as a kinase capable of phosphorylating the urea transporter UT-A1, indicating its involvement in the regulation of UT-A1 through phosphorylation (Chou2018Identification).

The protein contains several domains, including a P21-binding domain (PBD or CRIB), which binds GTP-bound CDC42 or Rho-like small GTPases such as Rac, contributing to its role in actin-myosin regulation (Chilton2020De). These interactions highlight CDC42BPB's involvement in cellular processes such as migration and cytoskeletal dynamics.
