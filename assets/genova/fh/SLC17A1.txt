# SLC17A1

## Overview
The SLC17A1 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 17 member 1 (SLC17A1), also known as sodium phosphate transport protein 1 (NPT1). This protein is a member of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) and functions as a multipass transmembrane transporter. It is primarily involved in the sodium-dependent transport of organic anions and phosphate across cell membranes, particularly in the kidney and liver (Omote2016Structure; Reimer2013SLC17:). SLC17A1 plays a critical role in the renal and hepatic clearance of organic anions, including urate, and is implicated in drug metabolism and excretion (Reimer2013SLC17:). Genetic polymorphisms in SLC17A1 have been associated with various clinical conditions, such as gout and cardiovascular diseases, highlighting its significance in human health (Koyama2015Genetic; HollisMoffatt2012The).

## Structure
The SLC17A1 protein, also known as NPT1, is a member of the solute carrier family 17 and is characterized by its role in the transport of organic anions and phosphate. Structurally, SLC17A1 is a multipass transmembrane protein with 12 predicted transmembrane helices, which is a common feature among members of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) (Omote2016Structure; Sreedharan2010Glutamate). These helices facilitate the transport of molecules across cell membranes, driven by an electrochemical gradient (Omote2016Structure).

The protein's structure includes a large extracellular loop between the first and second transmembrane domains, with both the N- and C-termini located on the cytosolic side (Sreedharan2010Glutamate). This configuration is typical for transporters in the SLC17 family. The SLC17A1 protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and stability, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context.

The SLC17A1 gene can produce splice variant isoforms, which may have differing functions or regulatory properties, although specific isoforms are not detailed in the provided context. The protein's structure and function are crucial for its role in the transport of anionic neurotransmitters and other organic anions.

## Function
The SLC17A1 gene encodes a protein that functions as a sodium-dependent phosphate transporter, primarily located in the brush border membrane of the proximal tubules in the kidney and to a lesser extent in the sinusoidal membrane of hepatocytes in the liver (Reimer2013SLC17:; Koyama2015Genetic). Although initially identified as a Na+-dependent inorganic phosphate transporter, SLC17A1 primarily transports organic anions such as probenecid and penicillin, rather than phosphate (Reimer2004Organic; Reimer2013SLC17:). This transport is electrogenic and occurs with affinities in the submillimolar range (Reimer2013SLC17:).

SLC17A1 plays a significant role in the hepatic and renal clearance of organic anions, including urate, and is involved in the metabolism and secretion of drugs like aspirin and β-lactam antibiotics (Reimer2013SLC17:). It is also implicated in the regulation of Lac-Phe levels, a metabolite, by mediating its efflux from cells, particularly in the kidney, which suggests its role in maintaining homeostasis of certain metabolites (Li2024SLC17A13). Polymorphisms in the SLC17A1 gene have been linked to elevated blood urate levels and gout, indicating its crucial role in urate transport (Reimer2013SLC17:; HollisMoffatt2012The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SLC17A1 gene, which encodes the sodium phosphate transport protein 1 (NPT1), have been associated with several clinical conditions. Variants in SLC17A1 are linked to altered uric acid metabolism, influencing the risk of hyperuricemia and gout. The SNP rs1183201 in SLC17A1 has been associated with gout arthritis and uric acid concentrations in various populations, including Han Chinese and New Zealand Caucasians (Zhou2015Polymorphisms). This SNP is thought to have a protective effect against gout by enhancing urate excretion (Zhao2022Trends).

In Japanese men, SLC17A1 polymorphisms, specifically rs1165196 and rs3757131, are associated with cholesterol homeostasis and hyperhomocysteinaemia, which are important factors in cardiovascular disease (Koyama2015Genetic). These polymorphisms are linked to lower homocysteine levels and a reduced risk of high LDL-C/HDL-C ratios (Koyama2015Genetic).

The SLC17A1 gene has also been implicated in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) in Kuwaiti families, where the rs1165196 variant is associated with higher plasma glucose levels and may influence the risk or progression of T1D through genetic and epigenetic mechanisms (Hebbar2023Linkage).
