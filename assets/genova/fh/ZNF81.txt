# ZNF81

## Overview
ZNF81 is a gene located on the X chromosome, specifically within the Xp22.1-Xp11 region, and encodes the zinc finger protein 81, a member of the Krüppel-type zinc finger protein family. This protein is characterized by its twelve tandemly arranged C2H2 zinc finger motifs, which are crucial for its role in binding nucleic acids and regulating gene expression (Marino1993A). Zinc finger protein 81 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences the transcription of specific genes, thereby impacting various cellular processes and organismal development. The protein's expression is modulated by hormonal influences, such as estrogen and progesterone, and it is involved in interactions with transcription factors like CTNNB1, HDAC2, and NOTCH1, which are enriched in extracellular vesicles derived from trophoblast cells (Dissanayake2024Do). ZNF81 has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, including X-linked intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder, highlighting its clinical significance in cognitive functioning and neurological processes (McKenna2018Wholegenome).

## Structure
ZNF81 is a member of the Kriippel-type zinc finger protein family, characterized by the presence of twelve tandemly arranged C2H2 zinc finger motifs at the C-terminus of the polypeptide. These motifs are known for their role in binding nucleic acids, facilitated by the coordination of zinc ions through a specific arrangement of cysteines and histidines (Marino1993A). The primary structure of ZNF81 includes a sequence of zinc finger units, with notable variations such as a leucine to phenylalanine substitution in fingers 8 and 11, which are nearly identical in sequence (Marino1993A).

The secondary and tertiary structures of ZNF81 are likely stabilized by the zinc finger motifs, which form compact, stable folds essential for their function in DNA binding. Each zinc finger unit is flanked by a conserved H/C link, contributing to the structural integrity and function of the protein (Marino1993A). ZNF81 is expressed in various human cell lines, producing multiple polyadenylated transcripts over 6000 nucleotides in size, suggesting the presence of splice variant isoforms that may lead to differences in function or localization (Marino1993A). The gene is located on the X chromosome, specifically within the Xp22.1-Xp11 region (Marino1993A).

## Function
ZNF81 is a member of the zinc finger protein family, which is involved in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. These proteins typically play roles in gene expression, cellular differentiation, and development. ZNF81 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it may influence the transcription of specific genes, impacting various cellular processes and organismal development. 

In healthy human cells, ZNF81 is expressed in various cell lines, suggesting a broad functional role. It encodes a Kriippel-type zinc finger protein with twelve tandemly arranged zinc finger motifs, which are characteristic of proteins involved in nucleic acid binding and regulation of gene expression (Marino1993A). The protein is primarily located in perinuclear cytoplasmic areas and is sensitive to hormonal influences, such as estrogen and progesterone, which can modulate its expression levels (Dissanayake2024Do). 

ZNF81 is also implicated in the regulation of gene expression in endometrial epithelial cells, where it is downregulated in response to extracellular vesicles derived from trophoblast cells. This suggests a role in embryo-maternal communication, although its precise function in this context remains unclear (EsHaghi2019Specific; Dissanayake2024Do).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ZNF81 gene have been associated with various neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A study identified a novel X-linked deletion between the zinc finger protein genes ZNF81 and ZNF182 in a family with twin boys diagnosed with ASD and intellectual disability (ID). This deletion affects regulatory content, including transcription factor binding sites associated with the MECP2/Rett syndrome pathway, which is crucial for neurological development (McKenna2018Wholegenome). The deletion was maternally inherited from a phenotypically unaffected mother, suggesting a complex genetic background contributing to the condition (McKenna2018Wholegenome).

ZNF81 has been implicated in intellectual disability and developmental disorders, although its functional impacts are not fully understood. The gene shows lower expression in the brain compared to ZNF182, which is widely expressed, particularly in the cerebellum. This differential expression may play a role in the observed phenotypes (McKenna2018Wholegenome). The study suggests that the probands' condition may result from multiple rare variants on a high-risk genetic background, rather than a single mutation, highlighting the complexity of genetic contributions to neurodevelopmental disorders (McKenna2018Wholegenome).

## Interactions
ZNF81, a member of the zinc finger protein family, is involved in various interactions that influence cellular processes. It is primarily located in perinuclear cytoplasmic areas and is sensitive to estrogen and progesterone, suggesting its regulation during different phases of the menstrual cycle (Dissanayake2024Do). ZNF81 interacts with transcription factors such as CTNNB1, HDAC2, and NOTCH1, which are enriched in extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from trophoblast cells. These interactions highlight the potential influence of EV protein cargo on ZNF81's role in the endometrium (Dissanayake2024Do).

In the context of X-linked mental retardation (XLMR), ZNF81 is associated with the histone demethylase PHF8. PHF8 binds to several XLMR genes, including ZNF81, and is involved in transcription regulation by reducing the repressive chromatin mark H3K9me2 at transcription start sites (KleineKohlbrecher2010A). This interaction suggests that ZNF81 may participate in transcriptional regulation through its association with PHF8.

ZNF81 is also part of a cluster of zinc-finger genes on the X chromosome, which includes ZNF674 and ZNF41. These genes are implicated in cognitive functioning, indicating a potential role for ZNF81 in neurological processes (Lugtenberg2006ZNF674:).
