# CD59

## Overview
CD59 is a gene that encodes the CD59 protein, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell surface receptor, which plays a pivotal role in the immune system by inhibiting the formation of the complement membrane attack complex (MAC). The CD59 protein, also known as protectin, is crucial for preventing the lysis of host cells by binding to complement proteins C8 and C9, thereby blocking the assembly of the MAC. This protein is expressed on a variety of cell types, including erythrocytes, leukocytes, and cells of the nervous system, providing protection against complement-mediated damage. Structurally, CD59 is characterized by a single polypeptide chain with a cysteine-rich sequence and is heavily glycosylated, which contributes to its stability and function. Mutations in the CD59 gene can lead to clinical conditions such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and congenital CD59 deficiency, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular integrity and preventing immune-mediated tissue damage (Karbian2018Molecular; Weinstock2022Association).

## Structure
The CD59 protein is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell surface receptor that plays a crucial role in inhibiting the complement membrane attack complex (MAC) and interacting with bacterial pore-forming proteins (Voisin2023Dynamics). Its primary structure consists of a single polypeptide chain with a hydrophobic signal sequence and a cysteine-rich sequence, typical of proteins that attach a GPI anchor post-translationally (Petranka1992Structure). The secondary structure of CD59 includes a central beta-sheet and a short alpha helix, with the beta-sheet involved in binding interactions with complement proteins (Voisin2023Dynamics; Johnson2013Structural). The tertiary structure is stabilized by multiple disulfide bonds, which are crucial for maintaining its conformation and function (Giddings2004Human). CD59 does not have a quaternary structure as it functions as a monomer.

CD59 is heavily glycosylated, with one fully occupied N-glycosylation site and multiple potential O-glycosylation sites, contributing to its structural stability and orientation on the cell surface (Rudd1997The). The protein's GPI anchor allows it to adopt various orientations relative to the membrane, which is important for its functional interactions (Voisin2023Dynamics).

## Function
The CD59 protein, also known as protectin, is a crucial component of the complement system in healthy human cells. It functions as a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell surface protein that inhibits the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC), a structure that can cause cell lysis. CD59 achieves this by binding to complement proteins C8 and C9, preventing the recruitment and polymerization of C9, which is essential for the final assembly of the MAC (MERI1996Structural; Karbian2018Molecular).

CD59 is expressed on a wide variety of cell types, including erythrocytes, leukocytes, platelets, and cells of the nervous system, providing protection against complement-mediated damage (Weinstock2022Association). Its role is particularly important in preventing the destruction of host cells by their own immune system, thereby maintaining cellular integrity and preventing tissue damage (RuizArgüelles2007The).

In addition to its primary function, CD59 may also play a role in regulating the alternative pathway of the complement system, as suggested by studies showing increased C3 deposition in cells lacking CD59 (Thielen2018CRISPRCas9). This indicates a broader role in complement regulation beyond MAC inhibition.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CD59 gene can lead to a range of clinical conditions due to its role in inhibiting the complement membrane attack complex (MAC). CD59 deficiency is associated with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), a condition characterized by intravascular hemolysis and a pro-thrombotic state. This occurs because of mutations in the PIGA gene, which affect the synthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, leading to a deficiency of GPI-anchored proteins like CD59 (RuizArgüelles2007The; Weinstock2022Association).

Congenital CD59 deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive disorder, results in severe neurological disease, chronic hemolysis, and recurrent ischemic strokes. It is caused by mutations in the CD59 gene, such as p.Cys64Tyr and p.Asp24Val, which lead to nonfunctional CD59 proteins that fail to inhibit MAC formation (Karbian2018Molecular; Chai2022A). Patients with congenital CD59 deficiency may present with symptoms like recurrent Guillain-Barré syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) (Javadi2020Recurrent; Chai2022A).

The deficiency is also linked to autoimmune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), highlighting the importance of CD59 in protecting cells from complement-mediated damage (Javadi2020Recurrent).

## Interactions
CD59 interacts with complement proteins C8 and C9 to inhibit the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC). It binds to the C8α protein, specifically interacting with the C-terminal β-strand of its central β-sheet, which prevents the C8α β-hairpin from piercing the lipid bilayer. This interaction is stabilized by a hydrogen-bonding network across a β-sheet spanning both proteins (Voisin2023Dynamics). CD59 also interacts with the C9 component of MAC, where it traps a transitory state of C9, preventing additional monomers from binding stably. This interaction involves electrostatic interactions, including salt bridges and hydrogen bonds between CD59 and C9 residues (Couves2022Structural).

CD59 is also involved in interactions with bacterial pore-forming proteins, such as cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs). These proteins engage CD59 through their membrane-binding domain, forming an extended β-hairpin that interacts with the C-terminal β-strand of CD59 (Voisin2023Dynamics). The orientation of CD59 relative to the membrane differs when interacting with MAC compared to CDCs, influenced by the flexibility of its GPI anchor and protein moiety (Voisin2023Dynamics). These interactions are crucial for CD59's role in inhibiting MAC-mediated cell lysis and influencing toxin binding and lytic activity (Voisin2023Dynamics).
