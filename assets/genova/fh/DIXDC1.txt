# DIXDC1

## Overview
DIXDC1, or DIX domain containing 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular signaling pathways, particularly the Wnt signaling pathway. The DIXDC1 protein is characterized by the presence of a DIX domain, which is crucial for its role in mediating protein-protein interactions and facilitating signaling processes. This protein is implicated in critical biological functions, including neural development and angiogenesis, by interacting with key proteins such as Dishevelled Segment Polarity Protein 2 (Dvl2) and Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia-1 (DISC1). Through these interactions, DIXDC1 influences processes like neural progenitor proliferation, neuronal migration, and vascular development. Additionally, DIXDC1 has been associated with various clinical conditions, including psychiatric disorders and cancer, due to its regulatory role in the Wnt signaling pathway and its impact on cellular proliferation and migration (Singh2010Dixdc1; Kim2022DIX; Ehebauer2009The).

## Structure
The DIXDC1 protein contains a DIX domain, which is crucial for its role in the Wnt signaling pathway. This domain exhibits a ubiquitin-like fold, characterized by a five-stranded β-sheet and a single α-helix, resembling the β-grasp fold typical of the ubiquitin superfamily (Ehebauer2009The). The DIX domain facilitates protein-protein interactions, particularly through homodimerization, which is essential for its function in signaling pathways (Ehebauer2009The).

The DIX domain of DIXDC1 is structurally similar to PB1 domains, although it lacks the electrostatic interactions typical of PB1 domains (Ehebauer2009The). Evolutionary trace analysis has identified conserved residues within the DIX domain, particularly on strand β4, which are important for maintaining its structural integrity and function (Ehebauer2009The).

DIXDC1 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions. The protein also has multiple splice variants, which can affect its localization and role in cellular processes (Ehebauer2009The). These structural features and modifications underscore the importance of DIXDC1 in cellular signaling and cytoskeletal organization.

## Function
The DIXDC1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in several cellular and developmental processes. In neural development, DIXDC1 interacts with the DISC1 protein to regulate neural progenitor proliferation and neuronal migration during embryonic cortical development. This interaction is mediated through the Wnt-GSK3b/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is essential for maintaining the balance between progenitor proliferation and differentiation (Singh2010Dixdc1). DIXDC1 also forms a complex with DISC1 and Ndel1, which is critical for the radial migration of neurons, a process regulated by the phosphorylation of DIXDC1 by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) (Singh2010Dixdc1).

In vascular development, DIXDC1 is involved in angiogenesis by modulating VEGFR2 levels. It interacts with Dishevelled Segment Polarity Protein 2 (Dvl2) to stabilize VEGFR2, enhancing its expression and promoting angiogenesis, particularly in the retina and other vascular tissues (Kim2022DIX). DIXDC1's role in angiogenesis is linked to its ability to facilitate crosstalk between the VEGF/VEGFR2 and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways, which are crucial for vascular development (Kim2022DIX). These functions highlight DIXDC1's importance in both neural and vascular development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the DIXDC1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in the context of psychiatric disorders and cancer. In psychiatric conditions, DIXDC1 interacts with the Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia-1 (DISC1) protein, a known susceptibility locus for major mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and depression. Mutations in DIXDC1 can lead to abnormal behavior in mice, suggesting a potential role in the pathophysiology of these disorders in humans (Singh2010Dixdc1; Kivimäe2011Abnormal).

In cancer, DIXDC1 is a positive regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway, which is crucial in the development and progression of various cancers. In gastric carcinoma, particularly the intestinal-type, high DIXDC1 expression is associated with poor prognosis, increased tumor invasion, and lymph node metastasis. It enhances β-catenin nuclear accumulation, promoting cell proliferation and cancer progression (Wang2015Upregulated). DIXDC1 is also involved in angiogenesis, where it modulates VEGFR2 levels, affecting vascular development and neovascularization. This role suggests potential implications in diseases related to abnormal angiogenesis, such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy (Kim2022DIX).

## Interactions
DIXDC1 (DIX domain containing 1) is involved in several protein interactions that play crucial roles in cellular processes. It interacts with Dishevelled Segment Polarity Protein 2 (Dvl2), a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway. This interaction is important for the regulation of VEGFR2 levels, which affects angiogenesis. DIXDC1 does not directly bind to VEGFR2 but influences its stability indirectly through Dvl2, which binds VEGFR2 (Kim2022DIX).

In the context of neuronal migration, DIXDC1 forms a complex with Ndel1 and DISC1, which is essential for radial migration during embryonic cortical development. This interaction is regulated by the phosphorylation of DIXDC1 at serine 250 by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), which is crucial for its binding to Ndel1 (Singh2010Dixdc1).

DIXDC1 also interacts with DISC1 to regulate neural progenitor proliferation through the Wnt-GSK3b/b-catenin signaling pathway. This interaction is necessary for modulating Wnt-TCF/LEF signaling in neural progenitor cells, and both proteins can compensate for each other's function in this pathway (Singh2010Dixdc1). These interactions highlight DIXDC1's role in both angiogenesis and neural development.
