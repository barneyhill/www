# GPR137C

## Overview
GPR137C is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 137C, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is known for its role in signal transduction across cell membranes. The GPR137C protein is characterized by its seven transmembrane helices, a hallmark of GPCRs, which facilitate its function in transmitting extracellular signals into intracellular responses. This receptor is particularly involved in endosomal and lysosomal functions, playing a significant role in cellular trafficking and signaling pathways. These activities are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental changes, thereby influencing various physiological processes such as cell communication, growth, and differentiation (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Structure
GPR137C is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is characterized by a core structure consisting of seven transmembrane helices. These helices form the primary structural feature of the receptor, facilitating its role in signal transduction across the cell membrane. The protein typically has an extracellular N-terminus and an intracellular C-terminus, which are common features among GPCRs. 

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation are often observed in GPCRs, including GPR137C, and these modifications can influence receptor function and signaling pathways. Glycosylation typically occurs on the extracellular domains, potentially affecting ligand binding and receptor stability, while phosphorylation on intracellular domains can modulate receptor activity and interactions with other proteins.

While specific domains or isoforms of GPR137C may vary, detailed structural data on this receptor is limited. The general architecture of GPCRs, including GPR137C, supports their role in a wide range of physiological processes by enabling the transmission of extracellular signals into intracellular responses. The structural characteristics of GPR137C, as with other GPCRs, are crucial for its function in cellular communication and response mechanisms.

## Function
GPR137C is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which are integral membrane proteins that play a crucial role in transmitting signals from the extracellular environment to the interior of the cell. These receptors are involved in various cellular processes, including cell communication, growth, and differentiation. GPR137C is specifically implicated in endosomal and lysosomal functions, which are essential for cellular trafficking and signaling pathways. The protein's activity in these organelles suggests it may influence the sorting and degradation of cellular components, thereby impacting cellular homeostasis and response to environmental changes. By participating in these processes, GPR137C contributes to the regulation of cellular signaling networks that are vital for maintaining normal cellular function and organismal health.
