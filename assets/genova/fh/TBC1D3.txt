# TBC1D3

## Overview
TBC1D3 is a hominoid-specific gene that encodes the protein TBC1 domain family member 3, which is involved in various cellular processes, including insulin signaling and neural progenitor proliferation. The protein is categorized as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that influences metabolic regulation and brain development by modulating key signaling pathways. TBC1D3 enhances insulin receptor signaling by delaying the degradation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and plays a crucial role in neural development by interacting with histone methyltransferase G9a to promote neural progenitor proliferation. The gene's expression and function have significant implications in clinical contexts, such as cancer and metabolic disorders, due to its role in cell proliferation and growth factor receptor signaling (Wainszelbaum2012TBC1D3; Hou2021TBC1D3).

## Structure


## Function
TBC1D3 is a hominoid-specific gene that plays a significant role in modulating insulin signaling pathways. It enhances insulin receptor signaling by delaying the degradation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), a critical component in insulin signaling. This delay is achieved by suppressing serine phosphorylation at key sites on IRS-1, which are necessary for its degradation. TBC1D3's effect on IRS-1 phosphorylation is mediated through the activation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and suppression of T389 phosphorylation on p70 S6 kinase (S6K) (Wainszelbaum2012TBC1D3).

TBC1D3 also plays a role in neural progenitor (NP) proliferation, particularly in the context of human cortical development. It interacts with the histone methyltransferase G9a, inhibiting its methyltransferase activity, which leads to increased NP proliferation and expansion of human cerebral organoids. This interaction is crucial for maintaining low levels of H3K9me2, a repressive transcription mark, thereby promoting the expression of genes involved in NP proliferation and cortical expansion (Hou2021TBC1D3).

In summary, TBC1D3 is involved in critical cellular processes such as insulin signaling and neural progenitor proliferation, influencing both metabolic regulation and brain development.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the TBC1D3 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. TBC1D3 is known to enhance epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, which can lead to cell transformation and tumorigenesis. This is particularly relevant in prostate cancer, where TBC1D3 is often amplified in primary and metastatic tumors (He2014Cytoplasmic). The gene's role in delaying the degradation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and enhancing insulin signaling suggests its involvement in metabolic disorders and cancer, as it affects cell proliferation and growth factor receptor signaling (Wainszelbaum2012TBC1D3).

TBC1D3 also plays a role in neural development by promoting neural progenitor proliferation through the suppression of the histone methyltransferase G9a. This interaction is crucial for cortical expansion, and disruptions in TBC1D3 expression or its interaction with G9a could contribute to neural developmental disorders (Hou2021TBC1D3). Additionally, TBC1D3's regulation of extracellular vesicles (EVs) affects tissue repair processes, and alterations in its expression can impact wound healing by modifying EV-mediated signaling pathways (Qin2019TBC1D3). These findings highlight the gene's potential clinical significance in cancer, metabolic disorders, and neural development.

## Interactions
TBC1D3 interacts with several proteins, influencing various cellular processes. It binds to the microtubule network through interactions with b-tubulin and a-tubulin, which are crucial for its cytoplasmic retention and role in enhancing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. The b-tubulin-interacting site is located within amino acids 286-353 of TBC1D3, and disruption of this interaction leads to its translocation to the nucleus, affecting EGFR signaling by altering c-Cbl recruitment and EGFR ubiquitination (He2014Cytoplasmic).

TBC1D3 also interacts with calmodulin (CaM) in a calcium-dependent manner. This interaction involves amino acids 157-171, which include two 1-14 motifs crucial for binding. CaM inhibits the ubiquitination and degradation of TBC1D3, stabilizing it and promoting matrix metalloproteinase 9 production and cell migration in breast cancer cells (Zhao2017Calmodulin).

In the context of insulin signaling, TBC1D3 interacts with the PP2A phosphatase and its regulatory subunit B56c. This interaction modulates the phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase (S6K), enhancing insulin receptor signaling and delaying IRS-1 degradation, which is significant for cell proliferation and glucose homeostasis (Wainszelbaum2012TBC1D3).
