LDL receptors are transmembrane cell surface proteins involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis of lipoprotein and protein ligands. The protein encoded by this gene functions as a receptor or, with Frizzled, a co-receptor for Wnt and thereby transmits the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling cascade. Through its interaction with the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling cascade this gene plays a role in the regulation of cell differentiation, proliferation, and migration and the development of many cancer types. This protein undergoes gamma-secretase dependent RIP- (regulated intramembrane proteolysis) processing but the precise locations of the cleavage sites have not been determined.[provided by RefSeq, Dec 2009].", "symbol": "LRP6", "taxid": 9606, "type_of_gene": "protein-coding", "umls": {"cui": "C1416918"}, "unigene": ["Hs.658913", "Hs.584775"], "uniprot": {"Swiss-Prot": "O75581", "TrEMBL": ["F5H0Z3", "H0YGH0", "F5H7J9", "H0YGW5"]}, "wikipedia": {"url_stub": "LRP6"}}
