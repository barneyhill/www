# SYCP2

## Overview
SYCP2, or synaptonemal complex protein 2, is a gene that encodes a structural protein integral to the formation and function of the synaptonemal complex (SC) during meiosis. The protein SYCP2 is categorized as a structural component of the SC, playing a crucial role in chromosome pairing, synapsis, and recombination during meiotic prophase I. It interacts with other synaptonemal complex proteins, such as SYCP1 and SYCP3, to ensure the proper assembly and stability of the SC, which is essential for accurate chromosome segregation and genetic diversity (Winkel2008Protein; Feng2017Synaptonemal). Beyond its role in meiosis, aberrant expression of SYCP2 has been implicated in various cancers, where it may contribute to genomic instability and resistance to DNA damage response therapies (Masterson2015Deregulation; Wang2024Meiotic).

## Structure
SYCP2 is a protein composed of 1,500 amino acids and is a key component of the synaptonemal complex, crucial for meiosis. The protein contains multiple potential DNA binding motifs and a C-terminal coiled-coil region (CCR) that is essential for its interaction with SYCP3, facilitating the incorporation of SYCP3 into the lateral elements of the synaptonemal complex (Winkel2008Protein; Feng2017Synaptonemal). The C-terminal domain of SYCP2, specifically amino acids 1132-1505, is crucial for binding to the C-terminus of SYCP1, acting as a linker between transverse filaments and lateral elements (Winkel2008Protein).

The N-terminal region (NTR) of mouse SYCP2 (mSYCP2) has been crystallized and determined to have a structure shaped like the letter 'L', containing two subdomains: an armadillo-repeat-like domain (ARLD) and an Spt16M-like domain (SLD). The ARLD is composed of fourteen helices and may provide a platform for interactions, while the SLD consists of a twisted ten-stranded β-sheet flanked by two helices, resembling the middle domain of the histone chaperone FACT (Feng2017Synaptonemal). SYCP2 forms antiparallel heterotetramers with SYCP3, resembling the coiled-coil tetramer structure of the yeast Red1 protein, suggesting a conserved role in meiosis (Takemoto2020Sycp2).

## Function
SYCP2 is a critical component of the synaptonemal complex (SC), a structure essential for meiosis in germ cells. It plays a pivotal role in the assembly and structural integrity of the SC, which is crucial for chromosome pairing, synapsis, and recombination during meiotic prophase I. SYCP2 interacts with SYCP1 and SYCP3, linking the transverse filaments to the lateral elements of the SC, thereby facilitating the proper synapsis of homologous chromosomes (Winkel2008Protein). The C-terminal region of SYCP2 is responsible for binding to the C-terminal domain of SYCP1, which is essential for anchoring transverse filaments to lateral elements (Winkel2008Protein).

SYCP2 also plays a role in the localization and stabilization of SYCP3 along the chromosome axes, which is necessary for the formation of the chromosome axis and maintaining cohesion between sister chromatids (Llano2023Synaptonemal). In the absence of SYCP2, SYCP3 fails to localize properly, leading to failed chromosomal synapsis and meiotic arrest (Feng2017Synaptonemal). SYCP2's function is vital for accurate chromosome segregation, contributing to genetic diversity and fertility.

## Clinical Significance
SYCP2 (synaptonemal complex protein 2) has been implicated in various cancers due to its aberrant expression, which is not typical outside of meiosis. In breast and ovarian cancers, high SYCP2 expression is associated with resistance to DNA damage response (DDR) drugs, such as PARP inhibitors and platinum-based chemotherapy, leading to poor prognosis and reduced overall survival in patients (Wang2024Meiotic). This resistance is linked to SYCP2's role in enhancing DNA repair through transcription-coupled homologous recombination (TC-HR), independent of BRCA1/2 status (Wang2024Meiotic).

In the context of human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC), SYCP2 is overexpressed and may contribute to genomic instability and oncogenic changes. Its expression is significantly altered in HPV-positive tumors, suggesting a potential role as a prognostic biomarker for early-stage detection and disease-free survival (Masterson2015Deregulation).

SYCP2 expression is also associated with HPV infection in cervical and head and neck cancers, where it is regulated by a demethylation-dependent process, indicating a possible link between SYCP2 expression and viral infection risk (Hosoya2021Synaptonemal). These findings suggest that SYCP2 could serve as a predictive biomarker for drug response and prognosis in various cancers.

## Interactions
SYCP2 is a key component of the synaptonemal complex (SC) and interacts with several proteins to facilitate its role in meiosis. It directly interacts with SYCP1 and SYCP3, which are essential for the assembly of the SC. The C-terminal domain of SYCP2 is crucial for binding to the C-terminus of SYCP1, as demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid screens and pull-down assays (Winkel2008Protein). This interaction is vital for linking the transverse filaments and lateral elements of the SC, ensuring proper synapsis during meiosis (Winkel2008Protein).

SYCP2 also interacts with centromere proteins CENP J and CENP F through its N-terminal region, which contains an armadillo-repeat-like domain (ARLD) (Feng2017Synaptonemal). These interactions suggest a role for SYCP2 in centromere association and cell division during meiosis (Feng2017Synaptonemal).

In addition to protein interactions, SYCP2 is involved in DNA repair processes. The M1 region of SYCP2 binds to DNA-RNA hybrids, promoting R-loop formation and facilitating homologous recombination (Wang2024Meiotic). This interaction is crucial for DNA repair and resistance to DNA-damaging agents, highlighting SYCP2's role in maintaining genomic stability (Wang2024Meiotic).
