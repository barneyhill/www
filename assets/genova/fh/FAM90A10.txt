# FAM90A10

## Overview
FAM90A10 is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 90, member A10. This gene is part of a larger family of genes that are characterized by their conserved sequences, which suggest a shared evolutionary origin and potentially similar biological functions. The protein encoded by FAM90A10 is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific role and mechanism of action remain to be fully elucidated. Research into the FAM90A10 gene and its protein product is ongoing, with studies aiming to uncover its potential implications in health and disease. Understanding the function and interactions of the FAM90A10 protein could provide insights into its contribution to cellular physiology and its relevance in clinical contexts.
