# TULP3

## Overview
TULP3 is a gene that encodes the TUB like protein 3, a member of the tubby-like protein family, which plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling and ciliary function. The protein is characterized by a conserved carboxy-terminal tubby domain that facilitates interactions with membrane phosphoinositides, such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), and a conserved amino-terminal region that interacts with the intraflagellar transport complex A (IFT-A) (Mukhopadhyay2011The; Mukhopadhyay2010TULP3). TUB like protein 3 functions as an adaptor protein, crucial for the trafficking of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to primary cilia, thereby influencing key signaling pathways, including the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) pathway (Mukhopadhyay2010TULP3). Its role in ciliary trafficking is significant in various physiological contexts, such as kidney function, where it helps maintain homeostasis and prevent cystogenesis (Legué2019Tulp3). Mutations in TULP3 have been linked to ciliopathies and other diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Jafari2022A).

## Structure
TULP3, a member of the tubby-like protein family, is characterized by a distinct molecular structure that includes a conserved carboxy-terminal tubby domain. This domain is a closed β barrel with 12 anti-parallel strands surrounding a central hydrophobic α helix, which facilitates binding to membrane phosphoinositides, particularly phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) (Mukhopadhyay2011The; Kerek2021A). The interaction with PIP2 is mediated by conserved amino acids such as Lys330 and Arg332 (Kerek2021A).

The amino-terminal region of TULP3 contains a conserved helix that interacts with the intraflagellar transport complex A (IFT-A), essential for ciliary assembly and transport (Mukhopadhyay2011The; Mukhopadhyay2010TULP3). This region is crucial for TULP3's role in GPCR trafficking to cilia (Mukhopadhyay2011The).

TULP3 undergoes post-translational modifications, including acetylation and ubiquitination, which regulate its stability. Acetylation by p300 increases stability, while deacetylation by HDAC1 decreases it. Key lysine residues, such as Lys316 and Lys389, are involved in these modifications (Kerek2021A).

The protein's structure and modifications are critical for its function in ciliary trafficking and cellular signaling, highlighting its role as a bridge between membrane phosphoinositides and the IFT-A complex (Mukhopadhyay2011The).

## Function
TULP3 (TUB like protein 3) is a crucial component in the regulation of ciliary function, particularly in the trafficking of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to primary cilia. It acts as an adaptor protein that links GPCRs to the intraflagellar transport protein complex A (IFT-A), facilitating their entry into cilia. This process is essential for the proper localization of specific ciliary proteins, which are vital for cellular signaling pathways, including the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) pathway (Mukhopadhyay2010TULP3).

TULP3 is active in the cytoplasm and cilia, where it influences cell differentiation and development. It is involved in the intracellular vesicular trafficking of GPCRs, such as Sstr3 and Mchr1, which localize to primary cilia. The protein's interaction with the IFT-A complex is crucial for the ciliary localization of these receptors, although it does not affect ciliogenesis itself (Mukhopadhyay2010TULP3).

In the context of kidney function, TULP3 regulates the transport of proteins like Arl13b and PC2 into cilia, which is critical for maintaining kidney homeostasis and preventing cystogenesis. Its role in ciliary trafficking is significant in the context of polycystic kidney disease (PKD), where its deletion can lead to cyst formation (Legué2019Tulp3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TULP3 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly those related to ciliary dysfunction. TULP3 is associated with ciliopathies, a group of disorders caused by defects in cilia function. Mutations in TULP3 can lead to renal and hepatic fibrocystic diseases, as demonstrated by a study identifying a pathogenic variant, R382W, which disrupts the Tubby domain necessary for TULP3's function in ciliary protein trafficking. This mutation results in impaired localization of membrane-associated proteins to the cilium, contributing to the development of fibrocystic diseases (Jafari2022A).

In the context of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), TULP3 acts as a transcriptional master regulator. Its expression is linked to the regulation of genes involved in key signaling pathways, including the Hedgehog signaling pathway, which is implicated in PDAC development. TULP3's role in negatively regulating this pathway suggests its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in PDAC (Sartor2014Computational).

Additionally, TULP3 mutations have been identified in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), where truncating variants were found in cases previously unsolved, indicating a potential role in nephropathy (Robert2022Exome).

## Interactions
TULP3 (TUB like protein 3) is known for its interactions with the intraflagellar transport complex A (IFT-A), which is crucial for the trafficking of proteins into primary cilia. TULP3 interacts with all known components of the IFT-A complex, including WDR19, IFT140, IFT122, THM1, WDR35, and IFT43. These interactions were identified through tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry in various cell types, such as hTERT RPE-1 cells and murine NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (Mukhopadhyay2010TULP3).

TULP3 also interacts with ARL13B, a membrane-associated protein, through its C-terminal tubby domain. This interaction is essential for the ciliary trafficking of lipidated proteins, such as ARL13B and HA INPP5E, in a manner independent of PI(4,5)P2 binding (Palicharla2021Interactions). The interaction with ARL13B is mediated by a conserved lysine residue in the tubby domain of TULP3, which is crucial for binding and trafficking of both lipidated and transmembrane cargoes to cilia (Palicharla2021Interactions).

TULP3's interactions with the IFT-A complex and ARL13B highlight its role in the trafficking of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other ciliary proteins, underscoring its importance in ciliary function and signaling pathways (Palicharla2021Interactions; Mukhopadhyay2010TULP3).
