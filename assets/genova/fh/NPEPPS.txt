# NPEPPS

## Overview
The NPEPPS gene encodes the puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase (PSA), a zinc-dependent metallopeptidase belonging to the M1 family. This enzyme is characterized by its ability to degrade polyglutamine sequences, which are resistant to proteasomal cleavage, thereby playing a crucial role in preventing the aggregation of potentially toxic peptides within cells (Menzies2010Puromycinsensitive). PSA is predominantly found in the cytosol and is highly expressed in the brain, where it is involved in various cellular processes, including neuropeptide metabolism, cell cycle regulation, and antigenic peptide processing (Bhutani2007Puromycinsensitive). The enzyme's structure features a unique V-shaped architecture with a central groove that facilitates substrate interaction, and it contains a microtubule binding sequence, suggesting additional roles in cellular dynamics (Madabushi2023Structure). Clinically, alterations in NPEPPS expression or function are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases and chemotherapy resistance, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Ren2011Cu; Jones2021NPEPPS).

## Structure
The NPEPPS gene encodes the puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase (PSA), a zinc-dependent metallopeptidase from the M1 family. The primary structure of PSA includes a HEXXHX18E motif, which coordinates a zinc ion essential for its catalytic activity, and a GAMENW sequence that interacts with substrate amino termini (Madabushi2023Structure). The secondary structure features HEAT repeat superhelices, which facilitate protein-protein interactions (Madabushi2023Structure).

The tertiary structure of PSA reveals a V-shaped architecture with four domains, typical of M1 family aminopeptidases. This structure is less compact compared to other M1 enzymes, with a central groove and a unique active site configuration that restricts substrate binding to one amino acid N-terminal to the cleavage site (Madabushi2023Structure). The enzyme's active site is located at the end of a long groove lined with hydrophobic and aromatic residues, which likely interact with peptide substrates (Madabushi2023Structure).

PSA also contains a microtubule binding sequence in a C-terminal HEAT repeat domain, suggesting a role in microtubule interactions (Madabushi2023Structure). The presence of PSA orthologs across various organisms indicates its essential function (Madabushi2023Structure).

## Function
The NPEPPS gene encodes the puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase (PSA), a cytosolic enzyme involved in the degradation of polyglutamine (polyQ) sequences, which are poorly cleaved by mammalian proteasomes. PSA is the only cytosolic enzyme capable of digesting short polyQ peptides, preventing their aggregation and the progression of polyglutamine disorders (Menzies2010Puromycinsensitive). It plays a critical role in the post-proteasomal degradation of polyQ sequences, which is essential for preventing the accumulation of insoluble and potentially toxic peptides in cells (Bhutani2007Puromycinsensitive).

PSA is a ubiquitous Zn2+ metallopeptidase, highly concentrated in the brain, particularly in regions such as the striatum, hippocampus, and cerebellum (Menzies2010Puromycinsensitive). It is involved in various cellular processes, including neuropeptide metabolism, cell cycle regulation, and antigenic peptide processing (Bhutani2007Puromycinsensitive). PSA also enhances autophagy, a cellular degradation process, by increasing the degradation rate of long-lived proteins through lysosomal and autophagy-dependent pathways (Menzies2010Puromycinsensitive). This activity is significant in managing the clearance of aggregation-prone proteins, such as mutant huntingtin and ataxin-3, thereby protecting against protein aggregation (Menzies2010Puromycinsensitive).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the NPEPPS gene have significant clinical implications in various diseases. In the context of chemotherapy resistance, NPEPPS has been identified as a novel driver of platinum resistance. Inhibiting NPEPPS can resensitize resistant cells to gemcitabine and cisplatin treatment, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target to overcome drug resistance in cancer (Jones2021NPEPPS).

In neurodegenerative diseases, NPEPPS plays a crucial role in degrading aggregation-prone proteins. Its activity is essential for preventing the accumulation of toxic protein fragments, such as polyglutamine sequences, which are associated with conditions like Huntington's disease. Inhibition or knockdown of NPEPPS increases the toxicity of these proteins, while overexpression reduces their aggregation and associated toxicity (Menzies2010Puromycinsensitive).

NPEPPS is also implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) through its regulation of the Cu, Zn-superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) protein. Decreased expression of NPEPPS in ALS patients suggests its involvement in the disease's pathogenesis, potentially offering a target for therapeutic intervention (Ren2011Cu). Additionally, NPEPPS has been linked to tauopathies, such as Alzheimer's disease, where it modulates TAU protein levels, providing a neuroprotective effect (Kudo2011Puromycinsensitive).

## Interactions
The puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase (NPEPPS) is involved in several interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in neurodegenerative diseases. NPEPPS interacts with the TAU protein, where it facilitates the degradation of hyperphosphorylated TAU, thereby reducing its accumulation and toxicity in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (Kudo2011Puromycinsensitive). This interaction suggests that NPEPPS may act as a proteasome chaperone, aiding in the clearance of misfolded proteins prone to aggregation (Kudo2011Puromycinsensitive).

NPEPPS also interacts with the Cu, Zn-superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) protein, where it regulates SOD1 levels through direct proteolytic activity. This interaction is particularly relevant in the context of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), as NPEPPS helps in the degradation of misfolded SOD1, potentially serving a neuroprotective role by preventing toxic protein aggregation (Ren2011Cu).

Additionally, NPEPPS is involved in the degradation of polyglutamine sequences, which are associated with diseases like Huntington's disease. It enhances macroautophagy, a key mechanism for clearing aggregation-prone proteins, thereby preventing the accumulation of toxic aggregates (Menzies2010Puromycinsensitive).
