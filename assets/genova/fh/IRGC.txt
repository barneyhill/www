# IRGC

## Overview
The IRGC gene encodes the immunity-related GTPase cinema, a member of the immunity-related GTPases (IRGs) family, which is primarily associated with cellular defense mechanisms. However, unlike other IRG proteins that are typically inducible by interferons and play roles in immune responses, the IRGC protein is constitutively expressed in the testis and is not involved in pathogen defense. This suggests a specialized function in reproductive biology, potentially related to spermatogenesis or other male reproductive processes. The IRGC protein is highly conserved across species such as humans and mice, indicating its evolutionary importance, although its precise role in human physiology remains to be fully elucidated (Bekpen2005Theinterferoninduciblep47(IRG); Bekpen2010Human page 0 of 3; Hunn2010The page 4 of 5).

## Function
The IRGC gene in humans encodes a protein that is part of the immunity-related GTPases (IRGs) family, which is involved in cellular defense mechanisms. Unlike other IRG proteins, IRGC is not inducible by interferons and is not involved in immune responses against pathogens. Instead, it is constitutively expressed in the testis, suggesting a specialized role in reproductive biology rather than in immune function (Bekpen2005Theinterferoninduciblep47(IRG)GTPasesinvertebrates:lossofthecellautonomousresistancemechanisminthehumanlineage page 3 of 10; Martens2006The page 9 of 10; Hunn2010The page 4 of 5).

The IRGC protein is highly conserved between humans and mice, indicating an important evolutionary role. However, its exact function in healthy human cells remains unclear. The gene's expression pattern and lack of inducibility by interferons suggest that its role may be distinct from other IRG proteins, which are typically involved in immune responses (Hunn2010The). The IRGC gene's conservation and specific expression in the testis imply a potential involvement in processes related to spermatogenesis or other aspects of male reproductive biology (Bekpen2010Human).
