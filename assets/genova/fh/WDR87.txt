# WDR87

## Overview
WDR87 is a gene that encodes the WD repeat domain 87 protein, which is characterized by the presence of WD repeat motifs. These motifs are typically involved in protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the WD repeat domain 87 protein may play a role in various cellular processes through its interaction with other proteins. While the specific biological functions of the WDR87 gene and its encoded protein are not fully elucidated, its involvement in cellular proliferation and disease progression has been noted, particularly in the context of cancer. The gene's amplification and mutation have been linked to several diseases, including cervical carcinoma, cutaneous melanoma, and nonsyndromic pediatric cataracts, indicating its potential significance in both oncological and genetic research (Halle2021Genomic; Abedalthagafi2019Precsion; Kontogianni2018Dissecting).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The WDR87 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through its mutations and alterations in expression levels. In cervical carcinoma, WDR87 is frequently amplified, particularly at the chr19q13.13 locus, and this amplification is associated with poor prognosis. Studies have shown that high-level amplification of WDR87 correlates with poorer overall survival in cervical cancer patients. Functional investigations indicate that overexpression of WDR87 leads to increased cellular proliferation, suggesting its role in cancer progression (Halle2021Genomic).

In cutaneous melanoma, WDR87 mutations have been identified in a significant proportion of patients, although the specific implications of these mutations in melanoma are not fully understood. The gene was found mutated in 87.5% of a small patient cohort, indicating a potential role in the disease (Kontogianni2018Dissecting).

WDR87 has also been associated with nonsyndromic pediatric cataracts, where mutations in the gene were identified in single cataract families. This finding highlights the gene's involvement in the allelic and locus heterogeneity of pediatric cataracts, contributing to the understanding of genetic factors in this condition (Abedalthagafi2019Precsion).
