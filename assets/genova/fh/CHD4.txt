# CHD4

## Overview
CHD4, or chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 4, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is a pivotal component of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex. This protein is classified as a chromatin remodeler, playing a significant role in transcriptional repression and chromatin structure maintenance. The CHD4 protein is characterized by its multimodular structure, including domains such as plant homeodomain (PHD) zinc fingers, a double chromodomain, and a SNF2-like ATPase motor domain, which facilitate its interaction with nucleosomal DNA and histone proteins (Farnung2019NucleosomeCHD4; Musselman2012Bivalent). Functionally, CHD4 is involved in various cellular processes, including DNA damage response, cell cycle regulation, and cardiac development, by modulating chromatin dynamics and gene expression (Wilczewski2018CHD4; Polo2010Regulation). Mutations in the CHD4 gene have been linked to several pathological conditions, including cancers, developmental disorders, and cardiomyopathies, underscoring its clinical significance (Liu2021CHD4; Li2014Architects).

## Structure
CHD4, also known as Mi-2β, is a large multimodular protein that plays a crucial role in chromatin remodeling as part of the NuRD complex. The protein structure includes several distinct domains: two N-terminal plant homeodomain (PHD) zinc fingers, a double chromodomain, a central SNF2-like ATPase motor domain, and a high mobility group (HMG) box-like domain in its N-terminal region (Hagman2021Chromodomain; Farnung2019NucleosomeCHD4; Musselman2012Bivalent).

The tandem PHD fingers of CHD4 are involved in histone-binding activity, specifically targeting histone H3 tails, which is essential for the repressive activity of the CHD4/NuRD complex. These PHD fingers bind histone H3 tails in a bivalent manner, with PHD2 exhibiting a higher affinity than PHD1 (Musselman2012Bivalent).

The ATPase domain of CHD4 is critical for its function, providing the energy necessary for chromatin remodeling. This domain binds at superhelical location (SHL) +2 on the nucleosome, inducing a conformational change in DNA without unwrapping it (Farnung2019NucleosomeCHD4).

CHD4 also contains domains of unknown function in its C-terminal region, and its structure allows for mapping of human disease mutations, which can affect chromatin remodeling by disrupting DNA binding or ATP hydrolysis (Farnung2019NucleosomeCHD4).

## Function
CHD4 (chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 4) is a critical component of the NuRD (nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase) complex, which plays a significant role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional repression. In healthy human cells, CHD4 is involved in maintaining compacted chromatin structures, which is essential for gene repression and the establishment of heterochromatin. This function is crucial for regulating gene expression during development and differentiation by repressing lineage-specific genes (Farnung2020NucleosomeCHD4).

CHD4 is also integral to the DNA damage response (DDR) and cell cycle progression. It is rapidly recruited to DNA damage sites in a poly(ADP-ribose)-dependent manner and is phosphorylated by the DDR kinase ATM. This recruitment facilitates the repair of DNA double-strand breaks and enhances cell survival following DNA damage. CHD4 also regulates the G1/S cell-cycle transition by controlling p53 deacetylation, which is vital for maintaining genome stability (Polo2010Regulation).

In the context of cardiac development, CHD4 represses the expression of non-cardiac muscle genes, ensuring proper cardiac sarcomere formation and function. Its absence can lead to the misexpression of skeletal and smooth muscle genes, disrupting cardiac function (Wilczewski2018CHD4).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CHD4 gene are implicated in a variety of diseases and conditions. CHD4 is frequently mutated in serous tumors, including serous endometrial and uterine serous carcinomas, where it plays a role in tumor development and progression (Li2014Architects). In breast cancer, high CHD4 expression is associated with poor prognosis, particularly in aggressive types like triple-negative breast cancer. CHD4 enhances the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor target genes, promoting tumor growth and metastasis (Novillo2021Role).

CHD4 mutations are also linked to developmental disorders. Sifrim-Hitz-Weiss syndrome, characterized by intellectual disability and congenital defects, is associated with CHD4 mutations (Liu2021CHD4). In neurological contexts, CHD4 mutations have been found in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders, Rett syndrome, and schizophrenia (Liu2021CHD4). 

In cardiology, a specific missense mutation, CHD4 M202I, causes left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy, a condition marked by excessive trabeculation and impaired cardiac function (Shi2022A). This mutation affects the expression of ADAMTS1, a crucial factor in cardiac development (Shi2022A). 

Overall, CHD4's role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation makes it a critical factor in the pathogenesis of various cancers, developmental disorders, and cardiac conditions.

## Interactions
CHD4, a component of the NuRD complex, engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for its function in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. It interacts with nucleosomal DNA and histone proteins through its ATPase motor, which contacts the phosphate backbone of nucleosomal DNA via electrostatic interactions. Specific residues, such as Asn1010, Arg1127, and Trp1148, insert into the DNA minor groove, facilitating these interactions (Farnung2020NucleosomeCHD4).

CHD4 also interacts with histone H3 through its plant homeodomains (PHDs), showing a preference for trimethylated or acetylated Lys-9, which may confer substrate specificity to the CHD4-NuRD complex (Silva2016The). The protein's N-terminal region binds poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) with higher affinity than DNA, playing a significant role in the DNA-damage response (Silva2016The).

CHD4 is part of both the NuRD and ChAHP complexes, interacting with core components such as GATAD2A/B and ADNP. Its C-terminal region contains an aliphatic stretch that contributes to these interactions (Tabar2024Intrinsically). The protein's interaction with the NuRD complex is mediated by its C-terminal regions, which contain structured but functionally poorly understood domains (Tabar2024Intrinsically). These interactions are essential for CHD4's role in gene transcription regulation and chromatin remodeling.
