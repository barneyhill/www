# TP63

## Overview
The TP63 gene is a critical component of the p53 gene family, encoding the tumor protein p63, which functions as a transcription factor. This protein is integral to the development and maintenance of epithelial tissues, playing a pivotal role in processes such as epithelial morphogenesis, differentiation, and cell adhesion. The tumor protein p63 is characterized by its structural domains, including a transactivation domain, a DNA-binding domain, and an oligomerization domain, which facilitate its interaction with DNA and other proteins. TP63 produces multiple isoforms, notably TAp63 and ΔNp63, through alternative splicing and promoter usage, each with distinct biological roles. TAp63 is involved in cellular senescence and metabolism, while ΔNp63 is crucial for epithelial development and maintenance. Mutations in TP63 are associated with various syndromes and conditions, including ectodermal dysplasia and limb malformations, underscoring its significance in human development and disease (Murray-Zmijewski2006p53/p63/p73; Yang1998p63; Perez2007Transcriptional).

## Structure
The TP63 gene encodes the tumor protein p63, a member of the p53 family, which plays a crucial role in development and tumorigenesis. The primary structure of p63 includes a transactivation domain, a DNA-binding domain, and an oligomerization domain. The DNA-binding domain is highly conserved among the p53 family, sharing significant sequence identity with p53 and p73 (Akter2021Comprehensive; Yang1998p63). The secondary structure of p63 features alpha helices and beta sheets, with the transactivation domain of p63 forming a single long helix that interacts with transcriptional coactivators (Osterburg2022Structural).

The tertiary structure of p63 involves a folded conformation that stabilizes its interaction with DNA. The protein contains a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, which is involved in protein interactions and is specific to p63 and p73 (Osterburg2022Structural; Sethi2015A). The quaternary structure includes tetramer formation, which is essential for its function as a transcription factor (Akter2021Comprehensive).

TP63 produces multiple isoforms through alternative splicing and promoter usage, including TAp63 and ΔNp63, which have distinct roles in cellular processes and cancer (Pokorná2021The; Murray-Zmijewski2006p53/p63/p73).

## Function
The TP63 gene, a member of the p53 family, encodes the tumor protein p63, which is crucial for the development and maintenance of epithelial tissues. In healthy human cells, p63 functions as a transcription factor, regulating gene expression related to epithelial morphogenesis, differentiation, and cell adhesion (Perez2007Transcriptional). It plays a significant role in maintaining the proliferative potential of keratinocytes and distinguishing stem cells from their progeny in stratified squamous epithelia (Perez2007Transcriptional). 

p63 is involved in several signaling pathways, including Notch and Wnt, which are essential for differentiation and proliferation. It regulates the Notch pathway by targeting JAG1 and JAG2 genes and influences Wnt signaling through interactions with the β-catenin destruction complex (Perez2007Transcriptional). The gene is also crucial for the formation and maintenance of stratified epithelial tissues, such as those found in the epidermis, oral cavity, and esophagus, by regulating cell adhesion complexes (Thépot2010Intraepithelial).

The TP63 gene produces multiple isoforms, including TAp63 and ΔNp63, which have distinct roles. ΔNp63 is predominantly expressed in epithelial cells and is crucial for normal development, while TAp63 is involved in senescence and metabolism (Pokorná2021The; Sethi2015A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TP63 gene are associated with a variety of syndromes and conditions characterized by ectodermal dysplasia, limb malformations, and orofacial clefting. These include Ectrodactyly-Ectodermal Dysplasia-Clefting (EEC) syndrome, Ankyloblepharon-Ectodermal defects-Cleft lip/palate (AEC or Hay-Wells syndrome), Limb-Mammary Syndrome (LMS), Acro-Dermato-Ungual-Lacrimal-Tooth (ADULT) syndrome, and Rapp-Hodgkin syndrome (RHS) (Rinne2007p63Associated; HolderEspinasse2007A). TP63 mutations can also cause non-syndromic conditions such as isolated split hand/foot malformation (SHFM4) and non-syndromic cleft lip (Enriquez2016Recurrence).

The TP63 gene encodes the p63 transcription factor, which is crucial for the development of epithelial tissues, limbs, and craniofacial structures. Mutations in TP63, particularly in its DNA-binding domain, can lead to a range of phenotypic expressions, including limb abnormalities, ectodermal dysplasia, and urogenital defects (Ianakiev2000SplitHandSplitFoot; Enriquez2016Recurrence). The variability in penetrance and expressivity of TP63-related phenotypes suggests that other genetic or environmental factors might influence the severity of these conditions (Enriquez2016Recurrence). Additionally, TP63 mutations have been linked to premature ovarian insufficiency, characterized by ovarian development issues (Mathorne2020Novel).

## Interactions
TP63, a member of the p53 family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. It interacts with proteins involved in the spindle checkpoint, such as CCT8, which associates with gamma tubulin1 and BUB1. These interactions are crucial for processes like keratinocyte differentiation, where TP63 interacts with APC/C components like CDC20 and ANAPC2 (Rozenberg2020Distinct).

TP63 also engages in transcriptional regulation through interactions with proteins such as WWP1, C/EBPb, SMAD4, and KLF5. WWP1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is essential for TP63's transcriptional activity, and its depletion can lead to cell cycle arrest. The interaction between C/EBP and ΔNp63 results in COX-2 expression, which is linked to inflammation in response to UV irradiation (Rozenberg2020Distinct).

In the context of cancer, TP63 isoforms TAp63 and ΔNp63 are regulated by Hsp70 and the E3 ligase CHIP. Hsp70 influences the ubiquitination and degradation of these isoforms, affecting cancer cell migration and invasion. The interaction between Hsp70 and TAp63 impacts the transactivation of tumor suppressor genes like p21 and Bax (Wu2021Hsp70). Additionally, TP63 interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch, which promotes its degradation, particularly affecting the ΔNp63α isoform (Rossi2006The).
