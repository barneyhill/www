# SMIM40

## Overview
SMIM40, or small integral membrane protein 40, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes. The protein product of SMIM40 is characterized by its integration into cellular membranes, where it plays a role in maintaining cellular structure and function. Although the specific biological functions and pathways involving SMIM40 are still under investigation, its classification as a transmembrane protein suggests it may be involved in signaling or transport across the cell membrane. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms and interactions of SMIM40 within the cell.
