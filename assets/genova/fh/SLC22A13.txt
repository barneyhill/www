# SLC22A13

## Overview
SLC22A13 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 22 member 13, also known as organic anion transporter 10 (OAT10). This protein is a member of the solute carrier family 22, which is part of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of transporters. OAT10 is characterized by its 12 α-helical transmembrane domains and is primarily expressed in the kidneys, where it plays a crucial role in the transport of organic anions, such as nicotinate and urate, across the apical membrane of renal tubular epithelial cells (Volk2013OCTs; Bahn2008Identification). The protein functions as an antiporter, facilitating the exchange of nicotinate or urate with intracellular metabolites like lactate and glutathione, and is involved in the reabsorption of nicotinate, which is essential for NAD+ synthesis (Volk2013OCTs; Bahn2008Identification). The activity of OAT10 is pH-dependent and can be influenced by chloride ions, suggesting its role as a proton-organic anion symporter (Yee2021Emerging).

## Structure
The SLC22A13 protein, also known as hOAT10, is a member of the solute carrier family 22 and is characterized by a common membrane topology with 12 α-helical transmembrane domains (TMDs) (Volk2013OCTs). This structure is typical of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), to which the SLC22 family belongs. The protein includes a large extracellular loop between TMDs 1 and 2, which is glycosylated and contains conserved cysteines that may form disulfide bridges, potentially playing a role in oligomerization (Volk2013OCTs). An intracellular loop between TMDs 6 and 7 contains phosphorylation sites for protein kinases, which are involved in the regulation of the protein's function (Volk2013OCTs).

The primary structure of SLC22A13 consists of 551 amino acids (Bahn2008Identification). The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the kidney, where it is localized to the apical membrane of renal tubular epithelial cells (Bahn2008Identification). SLC22A13 functions as an antiporter, exchanging nicotinate or urate against intracellular lactate, succinate, or glutathione (Volk2013OCTs). The protein's most relevant function is likely the reabsorption of nicotinate in the kidney (Volk2013OCTs).

## Function
The SLC22A13 gene encodes the organic anion transporter 10 (OAT10), which is primarily expressed in the kidneys and plays a significant role in the transport of organic anions, including nicotinate and urate. OAT10 functions as a high-affinity nicotinate transporter and a low-affinity urate transporter, facilitating the uptake of these substances across the apical membrane of renal tubular epithelial cells (Toyoda2022OAT10SLC22A13; Bahn2008Identification). In the kidneys, OAT10 is localized to the luminal side of the proximal tubules, where it contributes to the reabsorption of urate, influencing serum urate levels and renal urate excretion (Toyoda2022OAT10SLC22A13).

OAT10 operates through various exchange modes, such as nicotinate/OH and urate/OH exchanges, and is involved in urate/glutathione exchange, linking it to the renal glutathione cycle (Bahn2008Identification). The transporter is also implicated in the reabsorption of nicotinate, which is crucial for NAD+ synthesis, a vital component in numerous cellular processes (Bahn2008Identification). The activity of OAT10 is pH-dependent and may be influenced by the presence of chloride ions, suggesting a role as a proton-organic anion symporter (Yee2021Emerging).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC22A13 gene, particularly the c.1129C>T variant, have been associated with a decreased risk of developing gout, a common form of inflammatory arthritis characterized by elevated serum urate levels. This variant leads to a dysfunctional form of the organic anion transporter 10 (OAT10), resulting in increased renal urate excretion and lower serum urate levels, which reduces the susceptibility to gout (Toyoda2022OAT10SLC22A13).

The clinical significance of SLC22A13 is also highlighted by its interaction with certain urate-lowering drugs. Inhibitors such as losartan and lesinurad have been shown to affect OAT10 activity, with losartan demonstrating a stronger inhibitory effect on OAT10 compared to URAT1. This suggests that targeting OAT10 could be a potential therapeutic strategy for managing hyperuricemia and gout (Toyoda2022OAT10SLC22A13).

While the primary role of SLC22A13 in urate transport is established, its contribution is considered smaller compared to other transporters like URAT1 and GLUT9. Nonetheless, its involvement in urate reabsorption and interaction with pharmacological agents underscores its potential as a target for urate-lowering therapies (Toyoda2022OAT10SLC22A13).
