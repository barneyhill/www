# SCML1

## Overview
SCML1 (Scm polycomb group protein like 1) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the polycomb group (PcG) family, which is involved in the regulation of gene expression through chromatin modification. The SCML1 protein functions primarily as a transcriptional regulator by forming complexes with other PcG proteins to modify histones, thereby influencing gene silencing and activation. It is notably active in the nucleus and plays a significant role in various biological processes, including mitochondrial function and cellular energy metabolism, through its regulation of the humanin polypeptide family (Nan2018Circular). SCML1 is also implicated in male reproductive biology, with high expression levels in the testis, suggesting a role in spermatogenesis and adaptive evolution in primates (Wu2008Adaptive). Additionally, SCML1 has been studied in the context of cancer, particularly lung cancer, where its interaction with circular RNA circNOL10 affects tumor signaling pathways (Nan2018Circular).

## Function
SCML1 (Scm polycomb group protein like 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of gene expression through chromatin modification. It is part of the polycomb group (PcG) proteins, which play a crucial role in maintaining the transcriptional repression of target genes. SCML1 is typically active in the nucleus, where it interacts with other PcG proteins to form complexes that modify histones, thereby influencing gene silencing and activation (Nan2018Circular).

In healthy human cells, SCML1 is involved in transcriptional regulation, particularly through its interaction with circular RNA circNOL10. This interaction stabilizes SCML1 by inhibiting its ubiquitination, a process that usually marks proteins for degradation, thus promoting its expression (Nan2018Circular). SCML1 regulates the transcription of the humanin (HN) polypeptide family, which is involved in mitochondrial function and cellular energy metabolism (Nan2018Circular).

SCML1 is also implicated in male reproduction, with high expression levels in the testis, suggesting a role in spermatogenesis. Its rapid evolution in primates indicates adaptive changes that may have contributed to its functional modifications in reproductive processes (Wu2008Adaptive).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SCML1 gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions. A study identified a microdeletion at Xp23.13, which included the SCML1 gene, in a patient with non-obstructive azoospermia and congenital cataracts. This suggests that SCML1 may play a role in spermatogenic failure, although further research is needed to confirm its specific impact (Milunsky2020A). 

In the context of Nance-Horan syndrome (NHS), SCML1 is often mentioned alongside other genes like NHS and RAI2. While SCML1 is not directly linked to cardiac anomalies, its deletion in males may be associated with azoospermia (Guven2023NanceHoran). Another study involving a complex duplication-triplication event at the NHS locus, which includes SCML1, suggests that increased dosage of these genes could contribute to congenital heart defects, although the specific role of SCML1 remains unclear (Coccia2009X-linked).

In cancer research, SCML1 has been studied for its role in lung cancer development. The circular RNA circNOL10 promotes SCML1 expression by inhibiting its ubiquitination, which in turn regulates the humanin polypeptide family, affecting mitochondrial function and cancer cell behavior (Nan2018Circular). This interaction highlights SCML1's potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Nan2018Circular).

## Interactions
SCML1 (Scm polycomb group protein like 1) is involved in transcriptional regulation through its interactions with various proteins and nucleic acids. It interacts with the circular RNA circNOL10, which enhances SCML1 expression by inhibiting its ubiquitination. This interaction is significant in the context of lung cancer, where circNOL10 is downregulated. The interaction between circNOL10 and SCML1 has been confirmed through RNA pull-down assays and other experimental methods (Nan2018Circular).

SCML1 also interacts with members of the HN polypeptide family, specifically HN2 and HN8. These interactions have been demonstrated through electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), which showed a super-shifted band in nuclear extracts, indicating a direct interaction. SCML1 modulates the expression of HN2 and HN8, with its silencing leading to decreased expression and overexpression resulting in increased expression (Nan2018Circular).

These interactions suggest that SCML1 plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation, particularly in cancer pathways, by forming complexes with circNOL10 and the HN polypeptide family, thereby influencing mitochondrial function and tumor signaling pathways (Luo2019Guidance; Nan2018Circular).
