# PPARG

## Overview
The PPARG gene encodes the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), a nuclear receptor protein that plays a critical role in regulating gene expression related to various metabolic processes. As a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, PPAR-γ functions primarily as a transcription factor, influencing adipogenesis, lipid metabolism, and insulin sensitivity. The protein operates by forming heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and binding to specific DNA sequences known as peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPREs) to modulate the transcription of target genes (Zieleniak2008Structure; Hihi2002PPARs:). PPAR-γ is predominantly expressed in adipose tissue, where it is essential for adipocyte differentiation and lipid storage, and it also plays a significant role in anti-inflammatory processes and maintaining cellular redox balance (Duszka2020Peroxisome; HernandezQuiles2021PPARgamma). Mutations in the PPARG gene are linked to metabolic disorders such as familial partial lipodystrophy type 3, highlighting its clinical significance in metabolic health (Broekema2019Genegene; Agostini2006NonDNA).

## Structure
The PPARG gene encodes the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), a nuclear receptor protein involved in transcriptional regulation. The protein structure includes several domains: the A/B domain, which is involved in ligand-independent activation; the C domain, which is the DNA-binding domain containing zinc finger motifs; the D domain, known as the hinge region; and the E/F domain, which is responsible for ligand binding and activation (Zieleniak2008Structure). The DNA-binding domain (DBD) is highly conserved and plays a crucial role in recognizing target DNA (TomaFukai2024Structural).

PPAR-γ exists in two main isoforms, hPPAR-γ1 and hPPAR-γ2, resulting from alternative promoter usage and splicing. The hPPAR-γ2 isoform has an additional 30 N-terminal amino acids compared to hPPAR-γ1, which may influence receptor activity (Zieleniak2008Structure). The ligand-binding domain (LBD) of PPAR-γ features a central hydrophobic pocket formed by 12 conserved α-helices and a small β-sheet, with helix 12 playing a key role in transcriptional activation (Zieleniak2008Structure).

PPAR-γ functions as a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) to bind to peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPREs) in the promoters of target genes (Zieleniak2008Structure). The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which can affect its activity and interactions with coregulators (Hughes2012Ligand).

## Function
PPARG (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) is a nuclear receptor that plays a pivotal role in various physiological processes in healthy human cells. It functions as a transcription factor, regulating gene expression through mechanisms of transactivation and transrepression. In transactivation, PPARG forms a heterodimer with retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRα) and binds to PPAR response elements (PPREs) in the DNA, facilitating the recruitment of coactivators that enhance gene transcription. This process is crucial for adipogenesis and lipid metabolism (HernandezQuiles2021PPARgamma).

PPARG is predominantly expressed in adipose tissue, where it is essential for adipocyte differentiation and lipid storage. It drives the conversion of fibroblasts into adipocytes in a ligand-dependent manner, highlighting its role in defining adipocytic fate (Hihi2002PPARs:). PPARG also plays a significant role in maintaining insulin sensitivity and energy balance, influencing metabolic processes such as glucose homeostasis and fatty acid storage (Duszka2020Peroxisome).

In addition to its metabolic functions, PPARG is involved in anti-inflammatory processes by antagonizing pro-inflammatory signaling pathways like NF-kB, thereby contributing to immune regulation (HernandezQuiles2021PPARgamma). It also modulates oxidative stress by regulating the expression of antioxidant enzymes, helping to maintain cellular redox balance (Duszka2020Peroxisome).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PPARG gene are associated with several metabolic disorders, most notably familial partial lipodystrophy type 3 (FPLD3). This condition is characterized by abnormal fat distribution, insulin resistance, and metabolic complications such as diabetes and dyslipidemia. Mutations in PPARG can lead to a loss of function, resulting in impaired adipocyte differentiation and lipid metabolism, contributing to the development of lipodystrophic insulin resistance (Broekema2019Genegene; Agostini2006NonDNA). 

Specific mutations, such as those in the DNA-binding and ligand-binding domains, exhibit dominant-negative activity, inhibiting the function of the wild-type receptor and leading to severe insulin resistance and related metabolic issues (Agostini2006NonDNA). These mutations can also affect the receptor's ability to bind DNA and interact with coactivators, further disrupting normal metabolic processes (Agostini2006NonDNA).

Alterations in PPARG expression levels, influenced by environmental factors like diet, can also impact metabolic health. A high-fat diet may decrease PPARG expression in adipose tissue, potentially contributing to conditions such as FPLD3 and gestational complications like preeclampsia (Broekema2019Genegene). Additionally, post-translational modifications of PPARγ, such as phosphorylation and acetylation, can modulate its activity and are implicated in insulin resistance and other metabolic disorders (Broekema2019Genegene).

## Interactions
PPARG (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) is involved in numerous interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in transcriptional regulation. It forms heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXRs) to bind to PPAR response elements (PPREs) in DNA, which is essential for regulating gene expression (Chandra2008Structure; Madsen2022PPARγ). PPARG interacts with the TRAP mediator complex, particularly with TRAP220 and TRAP100, through LXXLL motifs, which are important for its transcriptional activity and adipogenesis (Kim2013Modulation). The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, involving Brg1 or Brm ATPases, also interacts with PPARG, facilitating transcription by remodeling chromatin (Kim2013Modulation).

PPARG's interaction with PGC-1α is crucial for its transactivation, linking nutritional and hormonal signals to energy metabolism (Kim2013Modulation). It also interacts with coactivators such as CBP/p300, SRC-1, SRC-2, and SRC-3, which modulate its transcriptional activity (Kim2013Modulation). Nuclear receptor co-repressor (NCoR) and silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT) are involved in repressing PPARG activity in the absence of ligands (Kim2013Modulation). Mutations in PPARG, such as R212Q and E379K, can disrupt its interactions with RXR and DNA, affecting its ability to activate target genes and leading to conditions like lipodystrophy (Madsen2022PPARγ).
