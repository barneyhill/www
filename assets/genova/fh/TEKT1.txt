# TEKT1

## Overview
TEKT1 is a gene that encodes the protein tektin-1, which is a structural component of motile cilia and flagella. Tektin-1 is categorized as a cytoskeletal protein and plays a pivotal role in the assembly and stability of the axoneme, the core structure of cilia and flagella. This protein is essential for the proper motility of cilia, which is crucial for various physiological processes, including respiratory function and embryonic development. TEKT1 expression is regulated by the transcription factor FOXJ1, highlighting its importance in ciliary motility. Mutations in the TEKT1 gene have been linked to ciliopathies, such as primary ciliary dyskinesia, underscoring its clinical significance in human health (Geng2024Tektin; Ryan2017Functional).

## Function
TEKT1 encodes the protein tektin-1, which plays a crucial role in the structure and function of motile cilia. Tektin-1 is a component of the axoneme, the core structure of cilia and flagella, and is essential for their motility. In healthy human cells, tektin-1 localizes at the basal body and axoneme of motile cilia, particularly in multiciliated epithelial cells such as those in the bronchial airways (Ryan2017Functional). It acts as a positive regulator of cilium length and is involved in maintaining proper ciliary function, which is critical for fluid displacement and cell movement (Ryan2017Functional).

The expression of TEKT1 is regulated by the transcription factor FOXJ1, which is a master regulator of genes required for ciliary motility. This regulation is observed in human and mouse bronchial epithelial ciliated cells (Ryan2017Functional). TEKT1's role in ciliary motility is further supported by studies in zebrafish, where knockdown of tekt1 results in phenotypes consistent with motile cilia dysfunction, such as body curvature and heart defects (Ryan2017Functional). These findings underscore the importance of tektin-1 in maintaining the structural integrity and function of motile cilia.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TEKT1 gene have been implicated in various ciliopathies, particularly those affecting motile cilia. TEKT1 is considered a candidate gene for primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a disorder characterized by respiratory distress and sinopulmonary syndrome due to defects in motile cilia (Ryan2017Functional). Specific mutations, such as the p.R244* truncating mutation and the p.K311N variant, have been associated with impaired ciliary function. These mutations can lead to reduced cilia motility and contribute to ciliopathy phenotypes, as observed in zebrafish models (Ryan2017Functional).

Individuals with TEKT1 mutations may present with a complex ciliopathy spectrum, including features of Mainzer-Saldino syndrome, which involves renal, retinal, and skeletal abnormalities, as well as lung infections and airway ciliary dyskinesia (Ryan2017Functional). The study of compound heterozygous variations in TEKT1 and WDR19 genes in affected individuals suggests that TEKT1 mutations may contribute to motile cilia dysfunction, potentially leading to airway manifestations similar to PCD (Ryan2017Functional). The clinical significance of TEKT1 mutations is still being explored, with further research needed to fully understand their impact on ciliopathy phenotypes (Ryan2017Functional).

## Interactions
TEKT1, encoding the tektin-1 protein, is involved in interactions that are crucial for the structural integrity and function of cilia and flagella. Tektin-1 is a component of the axonemal structure in motile cilia, where it interacts with other axonemal proteins to maintain ciliary motility. The localization of tektin-1 to the axoneme is essential for its function, and mutations in TEKT1 can disrupt this localization, leading to motility defects in cilia (Ryan2017Functional).

TEKT1 has been shown to interact with other tektins, forming part of the tektin bundle that stabilizes axonemal microtubules. Although specific interactions between TEKT1 and other tektins like TEKT3, TEKT2, and TEKT4 were not directly observed in some studies, TEKT1 is considered part of the tektin network that contributes to the structural organization of the axoneme (Geng2024Tektin).

In zebrafish models, TEKT1 interacts with WDR19, a gene associated with primary cilia ciliopathies. The interaction between TEKT1 and WDR19 suggests a synergistic effect that influences ciliary function and contributes to the clinical phenotype observed in ciliopathies (Ryan2017Functional).
