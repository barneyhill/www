# ZHX2

## Overview
ZHX2 is a gene that encodes the zinc fingers and homeoboxes 2 protein, a member of the ZHX family characterized by its zinc finger motifs and homeodomains. The ZHX2 protein functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor, playing a crucial role in regulating gene expression by interacting with various transcription factors, including nuclear factor-Y (NF-YA). It is localized in the nucleus and can form both homodimers and heterodimers with other ZHX family members, such as ZHX1 and ZHX3, to exert its repressive functions (KAWATA2003Zincfingers). ZHX2 is involved in critical cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and neural differentiation, and has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer, where it can act as either a tumor suppressor or an oncogene depending on the context (Wu2009ZHX2; Zhang2018VHL).

## Structure
The ZHX2 protein is a member of the zinc-fingers and homeoboxes (ZHX) family, characterized by its molecular structure that includes two Cys2-His2 type zinc finger motifs and five homeodomains (HDs) (KAWATA2003Zincfingers). The primary structure of ZHX2 consists of 837 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 92 kDa and an isoelectric point of 6.42 (KAWATA2003Zincfingers). The secondary structure of the zinc-finger region adopts a ββR-motif, which includes a two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and a C-terminal R-helix coordinated by zinc ions (Wienk2009The).

The tertiary structure of ZHX2 features a unique proline-rich region between the first and second homeodomains, which may interact with nuclear co-repressors like mSin3A (KAWATA2003Zincfingers). The quaternary structure of ZHX2 allows it to form both homodimers and heterodimers with ZHX1, with the dimerization domain located between residues 195 and 358 (KAWATA2003Zincfingers). The protein's nuclear localization signal (NLS) is mapped to residues 317 to 446, which includes the proline-rich region (KAWATA2003Zincfingers). ZHX2 is known to function as a transcriptional repressor, interacting with the activation domain of nuclear factor-Y (NF-YA) (KAWATA2003Zincfingers).

## Function
ZHX2 is a transcriptional repressor that plays a significant role in regulating gene expression in healthy human cells. It contains zinc finger motifs and homeodomains, which facilitate its function as a transcription factor. ZHX2 is localized in the nucleus, where it interacts with various transcription factors, including NF-YA, to modulate gene expression (KAWATA2003Zincfingers). The protein can form both homodimers and heterodimers with other members of the ZHX family, such as ZHX1, to exert its repressive functions (KAWATA2003Zincfingers).

ZHX2 is involved in the repression of specific promoters, such as the cdc25C gene, which is stimulated by NF-Y, indicating its role in controlling cell cycle-related genes (KAWATA2003Zincfingers). The protein's repressor activity is inherent and does not require interaction with ZHX1, suggesting it may interact with other transcriptional regulators and co-repressors like mSin3A (KAWATA2003Zincfingers).

In addition to its role in transcriptional repression, ZHX2 is implicated in maintaining neural progenitor cells during cortical development by interacting with ephrin-B1, highlighting its importance in neural differentiation and development (Wu2009ZHX2).

## Clinical Significance
ZHX2 plays a complex role in various cancers, acting as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene depending on the context. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ZHX2 generally functions as a tumor suppressor by repressing the expression of oncofetal genes like alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and glypican 3 (GPC3), as well as cell cycle genes such as Cyclin A and Cyclin E. Decreased nuclear expression of ZHX2 in HCC correlates with increased cell proliferation and poorer patient survival (Shen2008ZHX2; Li2022ZHX2; Yue2012Zinc). Conversely, in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), ZHX2 acts as an oncogene, promoting tumor growth and interacting with the NF-kB pathway to enhance cell proliferation and survival (Zhang2018VHL).

In multiple myeloma (MM), ZHX2 is often down-regulated due to hypermethylation, and low expression levels are associated with poor prognosis, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (Nagel2012Transcriptional; Legartova2010Expression). ZHX2's expression is also linked to immune regulation and lipid metabolism, with alterations potentially contributing to diseases like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and immune-related conditions (Li2022ZHX2).

## Interactions
ZHX2 is a transcriptional repressor that participates in various protein-protein interactions, forming both homodimers and heterodimers. It can form heterodimers with ZHX1 and ZHX3, as demonstrated through yeast two-hybrid systems and GST pull-down assays (KAWATA2003Zincfingers; Kawata2003The). The interaction with ZHX1 occurs through a region containing the HD1 domain, while the interaction with ZHX3 involves specific regions responsible for heterodimerization (Kawata2003The).

ZHX2 also interacts with the activation domain of NF-YA, a transcription factor, through residues 263 to 497, which overlap with its dimerization domain (KAWATA2003Zincfingers). This interaction is crucial for its role in transcriptional repression, as ZHX2 can repress the promoter activity of the cdc25C gene, which is stimulated by NF-Y (KAWATA2003Zincfingers).

In the context of multiple myeloma, ZHX2 has been shown to physically bind to NF-κB, regulating its nuclear translocation and contributing to proteasome inhibitor resistance (Jiang2020ZHX2). Additionally, ZHX2 interacts with linc00707, a long non-coding RNA, influencing gene expression in glioma cells (Yu2021HNRNPD).
