# C9

## Overview
The C9 gene encodes the complement component C9 protein, a vital part of the immune system's complement pathway. This protein is integral to the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC), a structure that plays a crucial role in the immune response by forming pores in the membranes of target cells, leading to cell lysis. Complement C9 is categorized as a transmembrane protein due to its ability to insert into lipid bilayers and form transmembrane channels. The protein's structure includes several distinct domains, such as thrombospondin, low-density lipoprotein receptor, and epidermal growth factor-like domains, which contribute to its function and interaction with other complement proteins. The polymerization of C9 is essential for the MAC's function, as it forms a tubular structure that disrupts the lipid bilayer of pathogens, aiding in their clearance from the body (Podack1982Polymerization; Morgan2016Terminal).

## Structure
The human complement C9 protein is a component of the membrane attack complex (MAC) and is composed of a 537-residue polypeptide chain with two N-linked oligosaccharides (Smith1992Molecular; DiScipio1984Nucleotide). The primary structure includes distinct domains such as thrombospondin (TSR) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) domains at the N-terminus, an epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) domain at the C-terminus, and a perforin-like sequence in the central region (Smith1992Molecular). 

The secondary structure features amphipathic alpha-helices, particularly in the membrane-interacting region, which includes residues 292-308 and 313-333 (Peitsch1990Localization). The tertiary structure of C9 is described as V-shaped, with an angle of 100 degrees between the two arms, each approximately 11.1 nm in length (Smith1992Molecular). 

In its quaternary structure, C9 can polymerize to form tubular structures resembling the MAC, with a dodecameric composition (Podack1982Polymerization). The protein undergoes significant structural rearrangement upon interaction with the C5b-8 complex, facilitating its insertion into lipid bilayers and the formation of transmembrane channels (DiScipio1984Nucleotide; Peitsch1990Localization). C9's amphiphilic nature, with distinct hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains, supports its role in membrane insertion (Biesecker1982An).

## Function
Complement C9 is a crucial component of the immune system's complement pathway, specifically involved in forming the membrane attack complex (MAC). C9 is the final protein to bind in the assembly of the MAC, which targets and destroys foreign cells by creating pores in their membranes, leading to cell lysis (Rossi2010Topology; Podack1982Polymerization). The polymerization of C9 into a tubular structure is essential for the MAC's function, as it forms a transmembrane channel that disrupts the lipid bilayer of target cells (Podack1982Polymerization; Morgan2016Terminal).

C9's role in the MAC involves its interaction with other complement proteins, such as C5b, C6, C7, and C8, to form a stable pore structure. This process is not dependent on cholesterol but may be influenced by the local membrane properties (Morgan2016Terminal). The protein's β-hairpins are critical for spanning the transmembrane region, contributing to pore formation (Morgan2016Terminal). C9 is active in the extracellular space, where it contributes to innate immunity by lysing pathogens and aiding in pathogen clearance (Rossi2010Topology).

## Interactions
Complement C9 is a crucial component of the membrane attack complex (MAC) in the complement system, interacting with several other proteins to facilitate its function. C9 interacts with the cell-surface complement inhibitor CD59, which binds to a specific peptide domain within C9, particularly between residues 359 and 411. This interaction is essential for the inhibitory function of CD59 on the complement system, specifically in the context of C5b-9-mediated hemolysis (Chang1994Identity). The binding affinity of CD59 is not detected in other C9-derived polypeptide fragments, indicating a unique binding site within this region (Chang1994Identity).

C9 also plays a role in the formation of the MAC by interacting with other components such as C6, C7, and C8 through its CDC/MACPF domains. These interactions are crucial for the assembly and structural integrity of the MAC, which forms a pore in the target cell membrane (Serna2016Structural). The MACPF domain of C8α is particularly important for binding C9, as it facilitates the formation of a trimeric complex with C8β and C8γ, which is necessary for C9 binding and subsequent MAC formation (Slade2006Functional).
