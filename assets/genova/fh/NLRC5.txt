# NLRC5

## Overview
NLRC5, or NLR family CARD domain containing 5, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the NOD-like receptor (NLR) family, which is characterized by its involvement in immune system regulation. The NLRC5 protein is distinguished by its unique domain architecture, comprising an N-terminal atypical caspase recruitment domain (CARD), a central nucleotide-binding domain (NACHT), and a C-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) region. This protein plays a pivotal role as a transcriptional regulator of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes, thereby facilitating antigen presentation and immune surveillance. NLRC5 is integral to the immune system's ability to recognize and eliminate infected or malignant cells by presenting endogenous antigens to CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) (Meissner2010NLR; Neerincx2013NLRC5). The gene's expression is inducible by interferons, particularly IFN-γ, which enhances its role in immune responses (Meissner2010NLR). Additionally, NLRC5 interacts with various proteins, including RIG-I and components of the inflammasome, to modulate immune signaling pathways (Ranjan2014NLRC5; Davis2011Cutting). Alterations in NLRC5 expression have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer, where it can act as both a tumor suppressor and promoter, depending on the context (Shukla2021The; Yoshihama2016NLRC5MHC).

## Structure
The NLRC5 protein is a member of the NOD-like receptor (NLR) family and is characterized by a unique domain architecture. It contains an N-terminal atypical caspase recruitment domain (CARD), a central nucleotide-binding domain (NACHT), and a C-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) region (Mótyán2013A). The atypical CARD of NLRC5 is composed of a six α-helix bundle with a general death fold, but it has unique structural features, such as the replacement of α-helix 3 with an ordered loop and the absence of a characteristic interruption in α-helix 1 (Gutte2014Unusual). This domain is involved in interactions with other proteins, such as RIG-I, affecting immune signaling pathways (Gutte2014Unusual).

The NACHT domain is crucial for the oligomerization of NLRC5, similar to its homolog Apaf-1, and is involved in nucleotide triphosphate binding and hydrolysis (Mótyán2013A). The LRR domain is predicted to form a large helical conformation, consisting of 33 to 43 LRRs, and is thought to be responsible for ligand interactions (Mótyán2013A). The LRR domain forms two full circles, rather than a planar shape, and contains potential disordered regions that may interact with ligands (Mótyán2013A). The structure of monomeric NLRC5 is stabilized by LRR-GxP and LRR-CARD interdomain interactions (Mótyán2013A).

## Function
NLRC5 is a key transcriptional regulator of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes, playing a crucial role in antigen presentation in healthy human cells. It is involved in the immune system's ability to recognize and eliminate infected or malignant cells by presenting endogenous antigens to CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) (Meissner2010NLR; Neerincx2013NLRC5). NLRC5 functions by shuttling between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, where it activates the transcription of MHC class I molecules, such as HLA-A, -B, and -C, as well as non-classical MHC class I genes like HLA-E, F, and G (Meissner2010NLR; Neerincx2013NLRC5).

NLRC5's activity is regulated at the transcriptional level and is inducible by interferons, particularly IFN-γ, which enhances its expression and subsequent MHC class I gene activation (Meissner2010NLR; Yao2013Expression). The protein interacts with the MHC class I promoter through an enhanceosome complex, similar to the regulation of MHC class II genes by CIITA, another NLR family member (Meissner2010NLR; Yao2013Expression). This regulation is essential for the activation, proliferation, and cytotoxic function of CD8+ T cells, which are vital for host defense against intracellular pathogens (Yao2013Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the NLRC5 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. NLRC5 is a key regulator of the MHC class I pathway, which is crucial for immune surveillance. In various cancers, including melanoma, colon cancer, and ovarian cancer, NLRC5 is often downregulated through mechanisms such as promoter methylation, copy number loss, and somatic mutations. These alterations lead to reduced expression of MHC class I genes, facilitating immune evasion by cancer cells (Vijayan2019Class; Yoshihama2016NLRC5MHC).

In melanoma, low NLRC5 expression is associated with poor prognosis and reduced immune cell infiltration, impacting the efficacy of immunotherapy (Lv2021Clinical). Conversely, in some cancers like hepatocellular carcinoma and clear cell renal cell carcinoma, elevated NLRC5 expression may activate oncogenic pathways, promoting tumor growth and migration (Shukla2021The).

NLRC5 mutations, particularly in cancers with microsatellite instability, are linked to reduced MHC-I expression and immune evasion (Shukla2021The). These findings suggest that NLRC5 plays a dual role in cancer, acting as both a tumor suppressor and promoter, depending on the context and type of cancer (Lv2021Clinical).

## Interactions
NLRC5 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in immune response regulation. It is known to interact with RIG-I, a protein involved in antiviral responses. This interaction is crucial for inducing a robust antiviral response against influenza virus infection. NLRC5 enhances RIG-I expression and contributes to the antiviral response by forming a complex with RIG-I and the influenza virus protein NS1. However, NS1 can interfere with the NLRC5/RIG-I complex, inhibiting antiviral signaling (Ranjan2014NLRC5).

NLRC5 also interacts with components of the inflammasome, particularly NLRP3 and ASC, facilitating inflammasome activation and IL-1β secretion. The NBD domain of NLRC5 is necessary for binding to NLRP3, while the LRR domain appears to inhibit this interaction. This suggests that NLRC5 can modulate inflammasome activity by interacting with NLRP3 (Davis2011Cutting).

Structurally, NLRC5 contains an atypical CARD domain, which has unique features compared to typical CARDs. Although direct interaction with the tandem CARD of RIG-I at biologically relevant strengths was not observed, NLRC5 may have distinct interaction modes, potentially involving auto-oligomerization upon activation (Gutte2014Unusual).
