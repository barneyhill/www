# CUL3

## Overview
CUL3 is a gene that encodes the cullin 3 protein, a key component of the cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL) complex, specifically the CRL3 complex. As a scaffold protein, cullin 3 plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is essential for the targeted degradation of proteins within the cell. This process is crucial for regulating numerous cellular functions, including cell cycle progression, stress response, and apoptosis (Genschik2013The; Cummings2009The). The cullin 3 protein is characterized by its structural domains that facilitate interactions with various adaptor proteins, enabling the ubiquitination of specific substrates. These interactions are modulated by post-translational modifications such as neddylation, which enhance the protein's stability and activity (Pinkas2017Structural). Mutations in the CUL3 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, including neurodevelopmental disorders and familial hyperkalemic hypertension, highlighting its significance in human health and disease (Schumacher2015Characterisation; Lin2023Current).

## Structure
CUL3 (cullin 3) is a protein that serves as a scaffold in cullin-RING ligase (CRL) complexes, which are crucial for ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. The primary structure of CUL3 includes a sequence of amino acids that form distinct domains, such as the amino-terminal domain (NTD) with three cullin repeats (CR1 to CR3) and a globular carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) containing a cullin homology domain (CH) (Sarikas2011The). The secondary structure of CUL3 is characterized by alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its overall stability and function.

The tertiary structure of CUL3 forms a scaffold that facilitates the assembly of CRL complexes. This structure includes a WH-B domain near the C-terminus, which is essential for dimerization and interaction with Nedd8, a ubiquitin-like protein that enhances the stability and efficiency of the CUL3 complex (Wimuttisuk2007The). The quaternary structure involves interactions with other proteins, such as BTB domain-containing proteins, which serve as adaptors and substrate recognition components (Sarikas2011The).

Post-translational modifications, particularly neddylation, are crucial for CUL3's activity. Nedd8 conjugation promotes conformational changes necessary for efficient ubiquitylation (Pinkas2017Structural). CUL3 can form heterodimers, consisting of one neddylated and one unneddylated molecule, which are essential for its function as a ubiquitin ligase (Wimuttisuk2007The).

## Function
The CUL3 gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL) complex, specifically the CRL3 complex, which plays a significant role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This system is essential for protein degradation, regulating various cellular processes such as cell cycle progression, stress response, and apoptosis (Genschik2013The; Cummings2009The). In healthy human cells, CUL3 is involved in the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of cyclin E, a process critical for controlling the transition from the G1 to S phase of the cell cycle (Singer1999Cullin3). CUL3 also regulates the Keap1-Nrf2 stress response pathway by mediating the degradation of Nrf2 under normal conditions, thus preventing its translocation to the nucleus (Genschik2013The).

CUL3 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences various cellular processes. It interacts with a variety of substrates, including the microtubule-severing protein p60/katanin, which is necessary for maintaining proper microtubule density and ensuring normal cell division (Cummings2009The). CUL3's role extends to metabolic processes, where it is implicated in blood pressure regulation and glucose homeostasis (Genschik2013The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CUL3 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, most notably neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) and familial hyperkalemic hypertension (FHHt). In the context of NDDs, CUL3 has been identified as a high-risk gene for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). De novo mutations, including nonsense and missense mutations, have been found in ASD patients, often leading to intellectual disability and developmental delay (Lin2023Current). These mutations can disrupt synaptic function and neuronal excitability, contributing to social and cognitive deficits (Lin2023Current).

CUL3 mutations also play a significant role in FHHt, a condition characterized by hypertension and hyperkalemia. The deletion of exon 9 in CUL3 results in impaired ubiquitylation of WNK kinases, leading to increased activation of the WNK kinase pathway and subsequent hypertension (Schumacher2015Characterisation; McCormick2014Hyperkalemic). This mutation causes a severe phenotype due to its impact on blood pressure regulation and electrolyte balance (Schumacher2015Characterisation).

Alterations in CUL3 expression or function can also affect the ubiquitination and degradation of proteins like RhoA, contributing to vascular constriction and hypertension (Ibeawuchi2015Hypertensioncausing). These findings underscore the clinical significance of CUL3 in various disorders.

## Interactions
CUL3 (cullin 3) is a scaffold protein that forms part of the BTB-Cul3-Rbx1 (BCR) ubiquitin ligase complex, which is involved in protein ubiquitination and degradation. CUL3 interacts with BTB domain-containing proteins, which act as substrate adaptors, facilitating the ubiquitination of target proteins. These interactions are crucial for the function of the ubiquitin ligase complex, as demonstrated by the binding of CUL3 to proteins like SPOP, which is involved in X-chromosome inactivation (Wimuttisuk2007The).

CUL3 also forms homodimers in vivo, a process mediated by the Winged-Helix B (WH-B) domain near its C-terminus. This dimerization is essential for its function and is facilitated by the conjugation of Nedd8, a ubiquitin-like protein (Wimuttisuk2007The). The presence of both neddylated and unneddylated CUL3 in the dimer suggests a regulatory mechanism for its activity (Wimuttisuk2007The).

CUL3 also interacts with proteins containing leucine-rich repeats (LRR) and WD40 domains, which can modulate its interactions with BTB domain-containing proteins. These interactions suggest a complex regulatory mechanism where CUL3 can bind multiple types of substrate adaptors, influencing the composition and function of the ubiquitin ligase complex (Wimuttisuk2014Novel).
