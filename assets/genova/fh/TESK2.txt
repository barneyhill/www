# TESK2

## Overview
TESK2 (testis associated actin remodelling kinase 2) is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. The protein encoded by TESK2 is predominantly expressed in the testis and prostate, where it is involved in processes such as spermatogenesis and actin dynamics. As a member of the TESK subgroup within the LIMK/TESK family of protein kinases, TESK2 features a unique C-terminal proline-rich domain and an N-terminal kinase domain responsible for its enzymatic activity (Makałowska2008Comparative; Mizuno2013Signaling). TESK2's kinase activity is essential for its function, as it phosphorylates cofilin, an actin-binding protein, thereby modulating actin filament dynamics and contributing to cellular processes like cell motility and morphology (sayi2008functional). The gene's expression and activity are subject to regulation through post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and alternative splicing, which may result in different protein isoforms (Li2023Phosphoproteomics; Makałowska2008Comparative). TESK2 has also been implicated in clinical contexts, such as breast cancer, where it may harbor mutations affecting its function (Agarwal2015Characterization).

## Structure
TESK2 (testis associated actin remodelling kinase 2) is a serine/threonine protein kinase involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. The protein contains an N-terminal kinase domain, which is responsible for its enzymatic activity (Makałowska2008Comparative). TESK2 is part of the TESK subgroup within the LIMK/TESK family of protein kinases and features a unique C-terminal proline-rich domain (Mizuno2013Signaling). 

TESK2 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its function and interactions (Li2023Phosphoproteomics). The protein can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may affect its structure and function (Makałowska2008Comparative). TESK2 is expressed predominantly in the testis and prostate, suggesting a role in spermatogenesis (Makałowska2008Comparative).

The kinase domain of TESK2 is related to that of LIM kinases, which are known to phosphorylate cofilin, thereby inhibiting its activity and affecting actin dynamics (Mizuno2013Signaling). However, specific details about the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of TESK2 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
TESK2 (testis associated actin remodelling kinase 2) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that plays a significant role in actin cytoskeleton organization. It is primarily expressed in the testis and prostate, where it influences cofilin phosphorylation and actin scaffold dynamics in testicular Sertoli cells, contributing to spermatogenesis and male fertility (Oussalah2022Epimutations). TESK2 exhibits dual-specific protein kinase activity, acting on serine/threonine and tyrosine residues, which is crucial for its function in actin remodeling and myogenic differentiation (Oussalah2022Epimutations).

TESK2 is mainly localized in the nucleus, and its nuclear localization is dependent on its kinase activity. A kinase-dead mutant of TESK2 localizes to the cytoplasm, indicating that its kinase activity is essential for its proper cellular localization (sayi2008functional). TESK2 phosphorylates cofilin, an actin-binding protein, which regulates actin filament dynamics by inactivating cofilin and promoting F-actin stability. This phosphorylation is crucial for cell motility and morphology (sayi2008functional). The regulation of cofilin by TESK2 is part of a broader mechanism involving actin turnover, which is essential for various cellular processes, including cell migration and the formation of cellular structures like lamellipodia (sayi2008functional).

## Clinical Significance
TESK2, a dual specificity protein kinase, has been implicated in breast cancer, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The gene was observed to have a trend of more frequently harboring high functional impact single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TNBC compared to estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) cancers, with a frequency of 16% versus 3% (Agarwal2015Characterization). Although TESK2 has not been previously implicated in cancer, its role in spermatogenesis suggests that mutations or alterations in its expression could potentially affect reproductive health (Agarwal2015Characterization).

In the context of breast cancer, TESK2 variants were observed in estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) patients, which were not reported in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), indicating a unique mutational profile in these patients (Agarwal2015Characterization). The study suggests that breast cancers may harbor unique combinations of genomic events, with potential functional interactions between germline and somatic mutations, although the lack of matching germline DNA in the study limits the ability to distinguish between these variants (Agarwal2015Characterization). These findings highlight the complexity of TESK2's involvement in cancer and suggest potential areas for further research.

## Interactions
TESK2, a serine/threonine kinase, is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. It interacts with cofilin, an actin-binding protein, by phosphorylating it, which modulates actin filament disassembly. This phosphorylation inactivates cofilin, preventing it from binding to actin and affecting cytoskeleton remodeling (Ferraro2014EZH2). TESK2 is part of the TESK subgroup of the LIMK/TESK family of protein kinases and is predominantly expressed in the testis and prostate (Makałowska2008Comparative). While specific interactions of TESK2 within protein complexes are not detailed, its role in phosphorylating cofilin suggests it may participate in pathways involving actin dynamics and cellular processes such as migration and morphology (Ferraro2014EZH2). The study by Ferraro et al. mentions TESK2 in the context of cofilin regulation but does not provide specific details on its interactions beyond its kinase activity (Ferraro2014EZH2). Overall, TESK2's interactions are primarily characterized by its enzymatic activity on cofilin, influencing actin cytoskeleton dynamics.
