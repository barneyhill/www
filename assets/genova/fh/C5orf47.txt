# C5orf47

## Overview
C5orf47 is a gene located on chromosome 5 in humans, encoding the protein known as chromosome 5 open reading frame 47. This protein is categorized as an uncharacterized protein, as its specific biological functions and interactions remain largely unexplored. While the precise role of C5orf47 in cellular processes is not well-defined, it is hypothesized to be involved in various cellular pathways due to its expression in multiple tissues. Further research is necessary to elucidate the functional significance of C5orf47 and its potential implications in health and disease.
