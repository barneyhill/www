# INPP5B

## Overview
INPP5B is a gene that encodes the protein inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase B, a type II phosphatase involved in the hydrolysis of phosphoinositides, specifically phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in phosphoinositide signaling pathways, influencing cellular processes such as endocytosis, signal transduction, and membrane trafficking (Williams2007Targeting; Mills2016Crystal). The protein is characterized by a pleckstrin homology domain, a 5-phosphatase domain, and an ASH-RhoGAP module, which are essential for its enzymatic activity and interactions with other proteins (Pirruccello2012Inositol). INPP5B is primarily localized in the cytosol and endosomes, where it interacts with RAB proteins to regulate membrane dynamics and is involved in the maturation of phagosomes, impacting immune responses (Williams2007Targeting; Bohdanowicz2012Recruitment). Alterations in INPP5B expression have been linked to diseases such as lung adenocarcinoma and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, highlighting its clinical significance (Zhang2021The; Deng2022Decreased).

## Structure
INPP5B encodes a protein that shares significant structural similarity with OCRL, with approximately 45% sequence identity. The protein features a domain organization that includes a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain at the N-terminus, a 5-phosphatase domain, and an ASH-RhoGAP module. The PH domain lacks the basic patch necessary for phosphoinositide recognition and does not bind phosphoinositide-containing liposomes (Pirruccello2012Inositol). The 5-phosphatase domain, which has a Dnase I-like fold, is crucial for its enzymatic activity and shares 62% identity with the catalytic domain of OCRL (Pirruccello2012Inositol). The ASH domain has an immunoglobulin-like fold, similar to proteins located in cilia or the centrosomal area of the cell (Pirruccello2012Inositol).

INPP5B contains a C-terminal CAAX motif, which facilitates membrane attachment via isoprenylation, a common post-translational modification (Dyson2012Phosphoinositide; Tariq2021Striking). The protein does not have the clathrin binding sites found in OCRL, which are important for targeting to clathrin-coated pits and endosomal/Golgi coats (Pirruccello2012Inositol). The ASH-RhoGAP module is crucial for protein-protein interactions and membrane recruitment (Pirruccello2012Inositol). There is no detailed information on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of INPP5B, nor on specific splice variant isoforms (Chen2022The; Tariq2021Striking).

## Function
INPP5B encodes a type II inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase involved in the hydrolysis of the 5-phosphate from phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P2] and phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P3]. This enzyme plays a crucial role in phosphoinositide signaling pathways, impacting cellular processes such as endocytosis and signal transduction (Williams2007Targeting; Mills2016Crystal).

INPP5B is active in the cytosol and endosomes, where it interacts with RAB proteins, particularly Rab5, to regulate membrane trafficking. This interaction is essential for its localization to the Golgi apparatus and endosomes, where it participates in the conversion of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) during endocytosis (Williams2007Targeting; Mills2016Crystal). INPP5B also localizes to the early secretory pathway, affecting the distribution of proteins like ERGIC53, which suggests a role in retrograde transport between the ERGIC and ER (Williams2007Targeting).

The enzyme is involved in the maturation of phagosomes by depleting phosphoinositides, which is crucial for actin disassembly and the regulation of Akt signaling, thereby influencing immune responses and pathogen degradation (Bohdanowicz2012Recruitment).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the INPP5B gene have been implicated in several diseases. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), decreased expression of INPP5B is associated with poor prognosis and advanced pathological stages. The gene's expression is significantly lower in cancerous tissues compared to normal lung tissues, and its low expression correlates with late-stage pathological features and poor survival rates. INPP5B is involved in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation and survival, and its overexpression has been shown to inhibit LUAD cell proliferation and migration, indicating a tumor-suppressive role (Deng2022Decreased).

In sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (sALS), the rs79609816 polymorphism in the INPP5B gene is associated with a higher risk of developing the disease. This polymorphism may affect the splicing, transcription, or translation of INPP5B, potentially leading to an abnormal protein that disrupts cellular calcium signaling, contributing to motor neuron death (Zhang2021The).

INPP5B also plays a compensatory role in ciliogenesis, particularly in the context of oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe. It can compensate for the loss of OCRL, another gene involved in primary cilia formation, suggesting its importance in cellular development and regulation (Luo2013Compensatory).

## Interactions
INPP5B interacts with various RAB proteins, which are small GTPases involved in vesicular trafficking. It specifically binds to the GTP-locked forms of RAB1A, RAB2A, RAB5A, RAB6A, and RAB9A. These interactions are localized to different cellular compartments, such as the ERGIC, Golgi apparatus, and endosomes. The binding of INPP5B to these RAB proteins is dependent on their nucleotide status, occurring only with the GTP-locked forms (Williams2007Targeting). Mutations in INPP5B that disrupt RAB binding result in mislocalization of the protein, indicating that RAB interaction is necessary for proper Golgi targeting (Williams2007Targeting).

INPP5B is also recruited to phagosomes by the adaptor protein APPL1, which is itself recruited by Rab5. This recruitment is crucial for the regulation of phosphoinositide metabolism during phagocytosis (Bohdanowicz2012Recruitment). The interaction with APPL1 and Rab5 facilitates the removal of specific phosphoinositides from phagosomes, affecting actin remodeling and Akt signaling (Bohdanowicz2012Recruitment). INPP5B does not interact with clathrin, unlike OCRL1, indicating distinct roles in endocytosis (Williams2007Targeting).
