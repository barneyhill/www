# MPV17L2

## Overview
The MPV17L2 gene encodes the MPV17 mitochondrial inner membrane protein like 2, which is an integral component of the mitochondrial inner membrane. This protein is crucial for the assembly and stability of the mitochondrial ribosome, particularly the large subunit (mtLSU), and plays a significant role in mitochondrial protein synthesis. As a transmembrane protein, MPV17L2 is involved in the organization of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and ribosome-nucleoid interactions, which are essential for maintaining mitochondrial structure and function. The absence or downregulation of MPV17L2 can lead to impaired mitochondrial translation, destabilization of ribosomal subunits, and altered mitochondrial morphology, highlighting its importance in cellular energy metabolism and mitochondrial integrity (Dalla2014MPV17L2).

## Function
The MPV17L2 gene encodes a protein that is integral to the inner mitochondrial membrane and plays a crucial role in mitochondrial ribosome assembly. This protein is essential for the formation and stability of the mitochondrial ribosome, which is necessary for mitochondrial protein synthesis. MPV17L2 co-sediments with the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome (mtLSU) and the monosome, indicating its involvement in the assembly of these structures (Dalla2014MPV17L2).

MPV17L2 is specifically associated with the mitoribosome and influences mitochondrial translation by facilitating the assembly of the small and large ribosomal subunits into a functional monosome. Its absence leads to impaired mitochondrial translation and destabilization of the ribosomal subunits, affecting the steady-state levels of ribosomal proteins (Dalla2014MPV17L2).

The protein is also involved in maintaining mitochondrial structure and function. Downregulation of MPV17L2 results in significant changes in mitochondrial morphology, such as swelling and nucleoid aggregation, and affects mtDNA distribution, although it does not significantly alter mitochondrial transcript levels (Dalla2014MPV17L2). MPV17L2's role in ribosome-nucleoid interactions is crucial for proper mitochondrial function and mtDNA maintenance (Dalla2014MPV17L2).

## Interactions
MPV17L2 is a mitochondrial protein that plays a crucial role in ribosome assembly within mitochondria. It is an integral inner membrane protein that interacts with mitochondrial nucleic acids and ribosomal components. MPV17L2 co-sediments with the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome (mtLSU) and the monosome, indicating a specific interaction with these structures, but not with the small subunit (mtSSU) (Dalla2014MPV17L2). Immunoprecipitation experiments have shown that MPV17L2 is enriched with mtLSU components, such as ICT1, a protein involved in ribosome assembly, but not with mtSSU components like MRPS27 (Dalla2014MPV17L2).

MPV17L2 is also implicated in the organization of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), as its depletion leads to mtDNA aggregation and affects the distribution of mtSSU, which becomes trapped in enlarged nucleoids (Dalla2014MPV17L2). This suggests a potential role in ribosome-nucleoid interactions, possibly involving the initial stages of mtLSU assembly at the nucleoid (Dalla2014MPV17L2). The exact mechanisms of these interactions remain unclear, but they highlight the importance of MPV17L2 in maintaining mitochondrial ribosomal integrity and function.
