# RNF224

## Overview
RNF224 is a gene that encodes the ring finger protein 224, which is categorized as an E3 ubiquitin ligase due to its involvement in the ubiquitination process. This protein plays a crucial role in tagging proteins with ubiquitin molecules, marking them for degradation by the proteasome, and is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating various cellular functions such as cell cycle progression, DNA repair, and signal transduction (Zhang2024StarFunc:). The RNF224 protein contains a RING finger domain, a structural motif that facilitates the transfer of ubiquitin molecules to substrate proteins, characteristic of many E3 ubiquitin ligases (Zhang2024StarFunc:). RNF224 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, indicating its involvement in diverse cellular pathways and regulatory mechanisms. Additionally, the gene has been implicated in skeletal muscle development and maintenance, particularly in aged female skeletal muscle, and is associated with muscle weakness in a mouse model with Down syndrome, suggesting a potential role in sarcopenia (Gharpure2023Sexspecific).

## Function
RNF224, or ring finger protein 224, is involved in the ubiquitination process, a critical cellular mechanism for protein degradation and regulation. This protein is predicted to have ubiquitin-protein transferase activity, which is essential for tagging proteins with ubiquitin molecules, marking them for degradation by the proteasome (Zhang2024StarFunc:). The ubiquitination process is vital for maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating various cellular functions, including cell cycle progression, DNA repair, and signal transduction.

RNF224 contains a RING finger domain, a structural motif that facilitates the transfer of ubiquitin molecules to substrate proteins. This domain is characteristic of many E3 ubiquitin ligases, which play a pivotal role in the ubiquitination cascade by recognizing and binding specific substrate proteins (Zhang2024StarFunc:). Despite low sequence identities and structural similarities to known ubiquitin-protein ligases, RNF224 is predicted to perform similar functions, suggesting its involvement in crucial cellular processes (Zhang2024StarFunc:).

In terms of cellular localization, RNF224 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, indicating its involvement in diverse cellular pathways and regulatory mechanisms. Its activity in these compartments underscores its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to various cellular signals.

## Clinical Significance
The RNF224 gene is implicated in skeletal muscle development and maintenance, particularly in aged female skeletal muscle. Its upregulation has been associated with muscle weakness in a mouse model with Down syndrome, suggesting a potential mechanism relevant to sarcopenia in aging females (Gharpure2023Sexspecific). Sarcopenia, a condition characterized by the decline of muscle mass and strength, is more pronounced in postmenopausal women due to changes in estrogen levels, which can influence muscle gene expression (Gharpure2023Sexspecific). The study highlights that RNF224, among other genes, is differentially expressed in aged skeletal muscle, contributing to muscle pathology (Gharpure2023Sexspecific).

The research underscores the importance of understanding sex-specific pathogenesis of sarcopenia, as different genes are dysregulated in males and females (Gharpure2023Sexspecific). While the study does not provide specific information on diseases directly caused by RNF224 mutations, its altered expression is linked to muscle weakness and potentially to sarcopenia, particularly in females (Gharpure2023Sexspecific). This suggests that RNF224 could be a target for therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating age-related muscle decline.
