# TMC2

## Overview
TMC2 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane channel-like protein 2, which is a member of the TMC family of proteins. This protein is characterized by multiple transmembrane domains and is primarily involved in mechanotransduction, the process by which mechanical stimuli are converted into electrical signals. TMC2 is predominantly expressed in the inner ear hair cells, where it functions as a pore-forming subunit of mechanosensitive ion channels, playing a critical role in auditory and vestibular functions. The protein's expression is temporally regulated, with significant roles in the early development of mechanosensitivity in the cochlea and sustained expression in vestibular hair cells into adulthood. TMC2 interacts with other proteins to form a mechanosensory complex essential for hearing and balance, and it can compensate for the absence of TMC1 in certain contexts, highlighting its functional versatility (Marcovich2020Evolution; Jia2020TMC1; Corey2018Function).

## Structure
The TMC2 protein is part of the TMC family, which is characterized by multiple transmembrane domains. It is predicted to have a structure with up to ten transmembrane domains, similar to other members of the TMC family, such as TMC1 (Marcovich2020Evolution; Corey2018Function). The protein is thought to form dimers, as observed in studies involving heterologous expression systems (Marcovich2020Evolution). TMC2 is suggested to be a pore-forming subunit of mechanosensitive ion channels, playing a crucial role in auditory transduction (Jia2020TMC1).

The TMC2 protein shares structural similarities with the TMEM16 family of ion channels, which are known for their ion conduction pathways (Corey2018Function). Although specific domains or folds of TMC2 are not well-characterized, the protein is part of a conserved family with a signature sequence motif, indicating potential functional roles in ion channel regulation (Keresztes2003TMC). The protein's structure includes transmembrane helices, but detailed information on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms is limited (Keresztes2003TMC).

## Function
TMC2 is a protein that plays a critical role in mechanotransduction, the process by which mechanical stimuli are converted into electrical signals in cells. It is primarily expressed in the inner ear hair cells, where it functions as a pore-forming subunit of mechanosensitive ion channels. These channels are essential for auditory and vestibular functions, facilitating the conversion of sound waves and head movements into nerve signals (Corey2018Function; Jia2020TMC1).

In the cochlea, TMC2 expression begins around birth, peaks during the first postnatal week, and declines by postnatal day 10, while TMC1 expression rises and is maintained into adulthood. This temporal regulation suggests that TMC2 is involved in the early stages of mechanosensitivity development (Corey2018Function). TMC2 is also expressed in vestibular hair cells, where it persists into adulthood, indicating its role in maintaining vestibular function (Kawashima2011Mechanotransduction).

TMC2 is localized at the tips of stereocilia in hair cells, where it is necessary for mechanotransduction currents. It can compensate for the absence of TMC1 in certain contexts, restoring mechanotransduction in mutant hair cells (Kawashima2011Mechanotransduction; Jia2020TMC1). The protein's structure includes multiple transmembrane domains, suggesting its function as an ion channel (Marcovich2020Evolution).

## Interactions
TMC2 is a protein that plays a crucial role in mechanotransduction, particularly in the auditory system. It is known to interact with several other proteins to form part of a mechanosensory complex. TMC2, along with TMC1, acts as a pore-forming subunit of sensory transduction channels in vertebrate inner ear hair cells. These channels are integral to the mechanosensory complex and interact with various proteins such as PCDH15, LHFPL5, TMIE, and CIB2, which are essential for the proper functioning and localization of the transduction channels (Jia2020TMC1; Marcovich2020Evolution).

CIB2, a calcium and integrin-binding protein, interacts with TMC2 and is essential for mechanotransduction in auditory hair cells. This interaction is crucial for the normal operation of mechanotransducer channels and hearing in mice (Giese2017CIB2). The interaction between CIB2 and TMC2 is disrupted by certain mutations in CIB2, which can lead to hearing loss (Giese2017CIB2). TMC2 is also part of a multimeric mechanosensory complex in hair cells, which is essential for hearing and balance (Marcovich2020Evolution).
