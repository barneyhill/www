# RCSD1

## Overview
RCSD1, or RCSD domain containing 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, a critical component of cellular structure and function. The protein encoded by RCSD1 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, where it plays a significant role in cytoskeletal dynamics by interacting with other proteins such as CAPZ. This interaction facilitates the assembly and disassembly of actin filaments, which are essential for various cellular processes, including cell shape maintenance, motility, and immune cell function (Qiao2022Pancancer). The activity of the RCSD1 protein is modulated by its phosphorylation status, which influences its role in cellular signaling pathways and immune responses (Qiao2022Pancancer). Additionally, RCSD1 is implicated in cancer biology, where its expression levels and interactions with other proteins can affect tumor progression and patient prognosis (Qiao2022Pancancer).

## Function
The RCSD1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in cytoskeletal regulation, particularly through its involvement in actin cytoskeleton organization. This protein is essential for maintaining cellular structure and function, influencing processes such as cell shape, motility, migration, and adhesion. These functions are critical for tissue development and repair, as they enable cells to respond to environmental cues and maintain homeostasis (Qiao2022Pancancer).

RCSD1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, especially in regions where dynamic actin remodeling occurs. This localization is significant for its role in cellular signaling pathways that regulate cytoskeletal dynamics. The protein interacts with other cytoskeletal components, such as CAPZ, to facilitate the assembly and disassembly of actin filaments, which is vital for cellular processes like mitosis and immune cell function (Qiao2022Pancancer).

In healthy human cells, RCSD1's function is closely linked to its phosphorylation status, which modulates its activity and interactions with other proteins. This regulation is important for its role in cellular immunomodulatory processes and immune-related signaling pathways, highlighting its involvement in maintaining immune homeostasis and response (Qiao2022Pancancer).

## Clinical Significance
The RCSD1 gene is implicated in various cancers due to mutations, alterations in expression levels, and changes in its interactions. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), RCSD1 expression is associated with immune cell infiltration and clinical prognosis. Alterations in RCSD1, such as arm-level gain and high amplification, correlate with changes in immune cell infiltration, impacting patient outcomes (Qiao2022Pancancer). In LUAD, RCSD1 expression is lower in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues and is higher in early-stage cancers, non-smokers, and those without lymph node metastasis (Qiao2022Pancancer).

RCSD1 is also involved in gene fusions, such as the RCSD1-ABL1 and RCSD1-ABL2 fusions, which are identified in Ph-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). These fusions result from chromosomal rearrangements and are associated with poor prognosis and high relapse rates. The RCSD1-ABL1 fusion, for instance, is expected to produce a functional protein that may contribute to disease pathology (Yap2016Diagnostic; Raca2014RCSD1–ABL2fusion).

In several cancers, low RCSD1 expression is linked to poor overall survival, while higher expression is associated with better recurrence-free survival, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Qiao2022Pancancer).

## Interactions
The RCSD1 gene encodes a protein that is involved in cytoskeletal regulation and signal transduction. It interacts with several proteins that play roles in cancer development and prognosis. Notably, RCSD1 interacts with USP7, CD2AP, and CAPZA1, which are implicated in various cellular processes related to cancer (Qiao2022Pancancer). These interactions suggest that RCSD1 may be part of a complex network influencing cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular signaling pathways.

In the context of lung cancers, such as lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), RCSD1 expression is correlated with immune cell infiltration, which is crucial for the tumor microenvironment. This correlation involves interactions with immune molecules, including MHC molecules like HLA-DOA, HLA-DPB1, and HLA-DMB, as well as chemokines and receptors such as CCL19, CCL5, CXCL13, CCR2, CCR5, and CCR7 (Qiao2022Pancancer). These interactions highlight RCSD1's potential role in modulating immune responses within tumors.

The STRING database has been used to identify the top 50 proteins interacting with RCSD1, providing insights into its protein interaction network and its involvement in biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions (Qiao2022Pancancer). These interactions underscore the multifaceted role of RCSD1 in cellular regulation and its potential impact on cancer progression and treatment outcomes.
