# EIF4B

## Overview
The EIF4B gene encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4B (eIF4B), a protein that plays a pivotal role in the initiation of translation in eukaryotic cells. As a translation initiation factor, eIF4B is involved in the recruitment of ribosomes to mRNA, facilitating the unwinding of secondary structures in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of mRNA, which is crucial for efficient ribosome binding and the initiation of protein synthesis (Li1999Eukaryotic; Ali2017Eukaryotic). The protein contains an RNA recognition motif (RRM) and an arginine-rich region, enabling it to bind RNA and interact with other translation factors such as eIF4A and eIF3 (Méthot1996A). eIF4B is subject to regulation through phosphorylation, which modulates its activity and interactions, linking it to various cellular processes, including cell growth and survival (Ali2017Eukaryotic; Bettegazzi2017eIF4B). Dysregulation of EIF4B expression has been associated with several diseases, including cancers and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Goodman2019eIF4B; Horvilleur2013A).

## Structure
The eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) is a protein involved in the initiation of translation in eukaryotic cells. It contains several important domains that contribute to its function. The protein has an RNA recognition motif (RRM) near its amino terminus, which specifically binds to 18S rRNA, and an arginine-rich RNA binding region in the carboxy terminus that binds RNA nonspecifically (Méthot1996A). The DRYG domain, rich in aspartic acid, arginine, tyrosine, and glycine, is located between amino acids 214 and 327 and is crucial for eIF4B's self-association and interaction with the p170 subunit of eIF3 (Méthot1996A).

eIF4B undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at specific serine residues such as Ser422, Ser504, and Ser406. These modifications are regulated by various kinases and are linked to its role in translation and cellular processes (Bettegazzi2017eIF4B). The phosphorylation at Ser504 is particularly significant in linking synaptic activity with protein translation in neurons (Bettegazzi2017eIF4B).

The protein's molecular mass is approximately 69 kDa, although it migrates aberrantly on SDS-polyacrylamide gels at 80 kDa (Méthot1996A). The structure of eIF4B, including its primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, is not detailed in the available context.

## Function
EIF4B is a crucial component in the process of translation initiation in eukaryotic cells. It functions primarily by enhancing the helicase activity of EIF4A, which is essential for unwinding secondary structures in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of mRNA. This unwinding is necessary for the proper binding of the ribosome to mRNA, facilitating the initiation of protein synthesis (Li1999Eukaryotic; Ali2017Eukaryotic). EIF4B contains two RNA binding domains: an RNA recognition motif (RRM) in the N-terminus that binds to 18s rRNA, aiding interaction with the 40S ribosomal subunit, and an arginine-rich region in the carboxy-terminus that binds to mRNA in a non-sequence-specific manner (Li1999Eukaryotic).

EIF4B also interacts with the eIF3 complex, particularly through the eIF3A subunit, and this interaction is enhanced upon phosphorylation of EIF4B, which is induced by the activation of the S6K kinase (Ali2017Eukaryotic). In the context of cellular biology, EIF4B is involved in promoting cell survival by facilitating the translation of genes involved in cell proliferation and survival, such as CDC25C, c-MYC, ODC, BCL-2, and XIAP (Ali2017Eukaryotic). It is active in the cytoplasm, where it plays a key role in protein synthesis and cellular growth.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4B (EIF4B) gene have been implicated in several diseases. In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), overexpression of EIF4B is associated with poor prognosis. This overexpression correlates with increased levels of proteins such as DAXX, ERCC5, and BCL2, which are involved in apoptosis and DNA repair, contributing to tumor cell survival. The mTOR signaling pathway is implicated in the upregulation of EIF4B, and mTOR inhibitors have been shown to reduce EIF4B expression, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies (Horvilleur2013A).

In breast cancer, particularly estrogen receptor-negative cases, EIF4B is a significant predictor of poor outcomes and is associated with higher tumor grade. It plays a role in cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, contributing to the malignant phenotype (Modelska2015The).

EIF4B is also involved in the pathogenesis of C9orf72-associated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). It mediates the production of toxic dipeptides from expanded G4C2 repeats, a hallmark of these neurodegenerative diseases. Reducing EIF4B levels in model organisms has been shown to mitigate toxicity, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Goodman2019eIF4B).

## Interactions
EIF4B is involved in several critical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that facilitate translation initiation. It interacts with eIF4A and eIF4H to form stable complexes that enhance RNA binding and helicase activity, particularly in the presence of AMPPNP, a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog. These interactions are specific to eIF4AI, as eIF4B and eIF4H do not stimulate eIF4AIII (Rozovsky2008Interactions).

EIF4B also interacts with eIF3, specifically with the p170 subunit, through a region rich in aspartic acid, arginine, tyrosine, and glycine, known as the DRYG domain. This interaction is crucial for the association of mRNA with the 40S ribosomal subunit (Swain2024Disordered; Méthot1996A).

In terms of nucleic acid interactions, EIF4B contains an RNA recognition motif (RRM) and an arginine-rich region that are essential for RNA binding. These domains allow EIF4B to bind both specific and nonspecific RNA targets, enhancing the helicase activity of eIF4A and facilitating the unwinding of RNA secondary structures in the 5' untranslated region of mRNAs (Naranda1994Two; Méthot1994The). These interactions are vital for the formation of the 48S initiation complex, which is essential for mRNA scanning and the start of protein synthesis (Swain2024Disordered).
