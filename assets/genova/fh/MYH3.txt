# MYH3

## Overview
The MYH3 gene encodes the myosin heavy chain 3 protein, a critical component of the thick filament in striated muscle, primarily expressed during embryonic and fetal development. This protein functions as a molecular motor, converting chemical energy from ATP into mechanical force necessary for muscle contraction. It is categorized as a motor protein due to its role in facilitating muscle contraction through interactions with actin filaments. The myosin heavy chain 3 protein is integral to the formation of the sarcomere, the fundamental contractile unit of skeletal and cardiac muscle cells. MYH3 expression is high during fetal development and decreases postnatally, as it is replaced by other myosin isoforms in adult muscle tissue. Mutations in the MYH3 gene are associated with several congenital myopathies, including Freeman-Sheldon syndrome and Sheldon-Hall syndrome, which are characterized by joint contractures and skeletal anomalies (Toydemir2006Mutations; Tajsharghi2008Embryonic; Zhao2022Expanding).

## Structure
The MYH3 gene encodes the embryonic myosin heavy chain, a crucial component of the thick filament in striated muscle. The protein structure includes a motor domain, which is essential for its function as a molecular motor, facilitating muscle contraction through interactions with actin and ATP. The myosin heavy chain consists of two globular heads and a long α-helical-coiled coil rod domain, which are integral to its function in force transduction (Tajsharghi2008Embryonic).

The primary structure of MYH3 involves a sequence of amino acids that form the myosin heavy chain. The secondary structure is characterized by alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure refers to the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is crucial for its interaction with other muscle proteins. The quaternary structure involves the assembly of myosin molecules into thick filaments, which are essential for muscle contraction.

MYH3 can undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may affect its function. The gene also has splice variant isoforms, which can result in different functional properties, allowing for diverse roles in muscle development and function (Cho2019A).

## Function
The MYH3 gene encodes the embryonic myosin heavy chain, a crucial component of sarcomeric thick filaments in muscle cells. This protein is involved in converting chemical energy from ATP hydrolysis into mechanical force necessary for muscle contraction (Pokrzywa2015Developmental). MYH3 is primarily expressed during embryonic and fetal development, playing a significant role in the formation of the sarcomere, the contractile unit of skeletal and cardiac muscle cells (Zhao2022Expanding). The protein consists of a globular motor domain connected to a long coiled-coil rod domain, forming a dimer that assembles with other proteins to create the sarcomere structure (Zhao2022Expanding).

In healthy human cells, MYH3 expression is high during fetal development and declines postnatally, as it is replaced by other myosin isoforms in adult muscle tissue (Zieba2017A). The protein is active in the sarcomere, where it interacts with actin filaments to facilitate muscle contraction (Zieba2017A). MYH3 also plays a role in the regulation of TGFβ signaling pathways, which are important for muscle function and development (Zieba2017A). Its normal function is essential for proper muscle development and function, and disruptions can lead to various skeletal disorders (Zhao2022Expanding).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MYH3 gene are associated with several congenital myopathies, most notably Freeman-Sheldon syndrome (FSS) and Sheldon-Hall syndrome (SHS), which are types of distal arthrogryposis. These conditions are characterized by congenital joint contractures, particularly affecting the limbs and face. FSS is one of the most severe forms, marked by distinctive facial contractures, while SHS is the most common form (Toydemir2006Mutations). MYH3 mutations interfere with myosin's catalytic activity, affecting muscle fiber force production, which contributes to the clinical manifestations of these syndromes (Toydemir2006Mutations).

MYH3 variants are also linked to autosomal dominant multiple pterygium syndromes, which involve congenital contractures, multiple pterygia, and skeletal anomalies such as vertebral fusion and scoliosis (Carapito2016Proteinaltering). Additionally, MYH3 mutations have been identified in cases of spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome (SCT), a disorder characterized by vertebral fusion, scoliosis, and carpal and tarsal synostosis (Zieba2017A; Carapito2016Proteinaltering). These mutations can disrupt TGF-β signaling pathways, leading to altered muscle function and skeletal abnormalities (Zhao2022Expanding; Zieba2017A).
