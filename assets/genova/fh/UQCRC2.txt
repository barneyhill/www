# UQCRC2

## Overview
UQCRC2 is a gene that encodes the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase core protein 2, a critical component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III. This protein plays a pivotal role in the electron transport chain, facilitating the transfer of electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c, which is essential for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation. As a core protein, UQCRC2 is integral to the structural and functional integrity of complex III, contributing to the formation of supercomplexes with other mitochondrial complexes, thereby enhancing electron transfer efficiency. The protein is characterized by its LuxS/MPP-like metallohydrolase domains, which are crucial for its function. Mutations in the UQCRC2 gene can lead to mitochondrial dysfunctions, manifesting in various clinical conditions, including mitochondrial complex III deficiency, which underscores its importance in cellular energy metabolism and mitochondrial quality control (Abou2023Novel; Burska2021Homozygous; Lu2021AMPK).

## Structure
The UQCRC2 gene encodes the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase core protein 2, a component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III. This protein is integral to the electron transport chain, contributing to energy production within mitochondria. Structurally, UQCRC2 contains two LuxS/MPP-like metallohydrolase domains, which are crucial for its function (Abou2023Novel). The protein's secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which are essential for maintaining its stability and function within the complex (Burska2021Homozygous).

UQCRC2 plays a significant role in the quaternary structure of complex III by interacting with other subunits, such as UQCRC1, to form a functional dimer. This interaction is vital for the assembly and stability of the complex, as well as for the formation of supercomplexes with complexes I and IV (Burska2021Homozygous). Mutations in UQCRC2, such as Gly222Ala, can lead to conformational changes that affect protein-protein interactions and the overall assembly of complex III, highlighting the importance of its structural integrity (Burska2021Homozygous). The protein's structure and interactions are critical for its role in mitochondrial function and energy metabolism.

## Function
The UQCRC2 gene encodes a core protein of the mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 complex, also known as Complex III, which is a crucial component of the electron transport chain in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This protein plays a vital role in cellular respiration by facilitating the transfer of electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c, contributing to the generation of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation (Burska2021Homozygous; Miyake2013Mitochondrial).

In healthy human cells, UQCRC2 is involved in the assembly and function of Complex III, which is essential for maintaining the stability and activity of the electron transport chain. It forms a part of a symmetrical dimeric structure that is crucial for the formation of supercomplexes with Complexes I and IV, enhancing efficient electron transfer and energy conversion (Burska2021Homozygous). UQCRC2, along with UQCRC1, forms a heterodimer that constitutes a significant portion of Complex III's mass, playing a critical role in its structural integrity (Burska2021Homozygous).

The proper function of UQCRC2 is essential for maintaining mitochondrial quality control through processes like mitophagy, which is crucial for cellular homeostasis (Lu2021AMPK). Mutations in UQCRC2 can lead to mitochondrial dysfunctions, highlighting its importance in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function (Burska2021Homozygous).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the UQCRC2 gene are associated with mitochondrial complex III (CIII) deficiency, a condition that affects the electron transport chain and energy production in cells. This deficiency can lead to a range of clinical manifestations, including metabolic abnormalities such as lactic acidosis, hyperammonemia, and hypoglycemia. Patients with UQCRC2 mutations may experience recurrent episodes of metabolic decompensation, characterized by elevated blood lactate and metabolic acidosis (Abou2023Novel).

The clinical presentation of UQCRC2-related disorders can vary significantly. Some patients exhibit severe encephalomyopathy, developmental delays, and neurological symptoms such as Leigh-like syndrome, while others may have normal neurodevelopment despite frequent metabolic decompensations (Abou2023Novel; Burska2021Homozygous). Specific mutations, such as the Gly222Ala mutation, have been linked to severe encephalomyopathy and mitochondrial structural abnormalities, including defects in CIII assembly and impaired electron flux between mitochondrial complexes (Burska2021Homozygous).

The UQCRC2 mutation p.Arg183Trp has been identified in patients with neonatal-onset recurrent metabolic decompensation, presenting with symptoms like hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis (Miyake2013Mitochondrial). These findings underscore the importance of UQCRC2 in maintaining mitochondrial function and highlight the genetic complexity of CIII deficiency.

## Interactions
UQCRC2, a core protein of mitochondrial complex III, participates in several critical interactions within the mitochondrial respiratory chain. It is involved in the assembly and stability of complex III, interacting with other subunits such as UQCRC1 and UQCRFS1. Mutations in UQCRC2, such as Gly222Ala, can disrupt these interactions, leading to impaired complex III assembly and function (Burska2021Homozygous). 

The UQCRC2 protein also plays a role in mitophagy, a process crucial for maintaining mitochondrial quality. It interacts with the PINK1-PRKN pathway, facilitating PRKN recruitment to mitochondria, which is essential for mitophagy regulation. This interaction is significant in the context of alcohol-induced liver disease, where UQCRC2 overexpression enhances mitophagic flux and reduces liver damage (Lu2021AMPK).

Additionally, UQCRC2 mutations, such as Arg183Trp, can destabilize complex III by disrupting the hydrophobic core at the homodimer interface, affecting protein stability and function (Miyake2013Mitochondrial). These interactions highlight UQCRC2's role in both structural integrity and functional regulation of mitochondrial processes.
