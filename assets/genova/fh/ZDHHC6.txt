# ZDHHC6

## Overview
ZDHHC6 is a gene that encodes the protein zinc finger DHHC-type palmitoyltransferase 6, which is a member of the DHHC family of palmitoyltransferases. This protein is characterized by the presence of a conserved Asp-His-His-Cys (DHHC) motif, which is essential for its enzymatic activity. As a tetra-spanning membrane protein, ZDHHC6 is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it plays a critical role in the post-translational modification of proteins through palmitoylation. This modification involves the addition of palmitate, a fatty acid, to specific cysteine residues on target proteins, influencing their localization, stability, and function. ZDHHC6 is involved in the palmitoylation of several key ER proteins, including the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP3R) and calnexin, which are vital for calcium signaling and protein trafficking. The activity of ZDHHC6 is dynamically regulated by its own palmitoylation and depalmitoylation, mediated by other enzymes such as ZDHHC16 and Acyl Protein Thioesterase 2 (APT2), respectively. This regulation allows ZDHHC6 to modulate its function and maintain cellular homeostasis (Abrami2017Identification; Fredericks2014Stable; Gadalla2019Toward).

## Structure
ZDHHC6 is a protein that belongs to the DHHC family of palmitoyltransferases, characterized by a conserved Asp-His-His-Cys (DHHC) motif within a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) that is crucial for its catalytic activity (Gadalla2019Toward). The protein is a tetra-spanning membrane protein localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and contains 4-6 predicted transmembrane domains (TMDs) (Abrami2017Identification; Gadalla2019Toward). 

ZDHHC6 has a short N-terminal extension and a long C-terminal tail, which includes a domain of unknown structure and a variant SH3_2 domain (Abrami2017Identification). The C-terminus contains a KKNR motif that contributes to its ER localization (Abrami2017Identification). The protein undergoes palmitoylation at three cysteine residues (Cys-328, Cys-329, and Cys-343) within its SH3 domain, which is essential for its function, localization, and stability (Abrami2017Identification; Gadalla2019Toward). 

The palmitoylation of ZDHHC6 is regulated by another palmitoyltransferase, ZDHHC16, and depalmitoylation is mediated by Acyl Protein Thioesterase APT2 (Abrami2017Identification). This dynamic palmitoylation allows for the interconversion of eight differentially palmitoylated species, affecting the protein's activity and abundance (Abrami2017Identification).

## Function
ZDHHC6 is a palmitoyltransferase enzyme that plays a crucial role in the palmitoylation of proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This post-translational modification involves the addition of palmitate, a fatty acid, to specific cysteine residues on target proteins, affecting their localization, stability, and function (Abrami2017Identification). ZDHHC6 is involved in the palmitoylation of several key ER proteins, including the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP3R), calnexin, and the transferrin receptor, which are essential for calcium signaling and protein trafficking (Abrami2017Identification; Fredericks2014Stable).

The activity of ZDHHC6 is regulated by its own palmitoylation, which is mediated by another palmitoyltransferase, ZDHHC16, and reversed by Acyl Protein Thioesterase 2 (APT2). This dynamic palmitoylation-depalmitoylation cycle allows ZDHHC6 to exist in different activity states, enabling precise control over its function (Abrami2017Identification). The interaction between ZDHHC6 and selenoprotein K (Selk) is also critical for the palmitoylation and stability of IP3R, highlighting the importance of ZDHHC6 in maintaining proper calcium signaling in cells (Fredericks2014Stable).

Overall, ZDHHC6 is essential for the regulation of protein function and stability in the ER, impacting cellular homeostasis and signaling pathways (Abrami2017Identification).

## Clinical Significance
ZDHHC6, a palmitoyltransferase enzyme, has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in protein palmitoylation. In colorectal cancer (CRC), ZDHHC6 is overexpressed, contributing to tumorigenesis by promoting lipid biosynthesis and metabolic reprogramming. This overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and advanced pathological states in CRC patients (Shan2024Palmitoyltransferase). ZDHHC6 stabilizes PPARγ, a nuclear receptor involved in lipid metabolism, enhancing fatty acid biosynthesis and supporting cancer cell survival and growth (Shan2024Palmitoyltransferase). Inhibition of ZDHHC6 has been shown to reduce tumor growth in mouse models, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Shan2024Palmitoyltransferase).

ZDHHC6 is also associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disease. A genome-wide meta-analysis identified the ACSL5-ZDHHC6 locus as linked to ALS, with ZDHHC6 potentially being the relevant disease-associated gene. The study suggests that ZDHHC6 may play a role in ALS through its involvement in the stability and function of key endoplasmic reticulum substrates (Iacoangeli2020Genomewide). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ZDHHC6 in both cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.

## Interactions
ZDHHC6, a palmitoyltransferase enzyme, participates in several key interactions with other proteins, primarily within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It interacts with ZDHHC16, another palmitoyltransferase, which regulates ZDHHC6's activity through palmitoylation. This interaction is crucial for ZDHHC6's ability to palmitoylate substrates such as calnexin, affecting their stability and function (Abrami2017Identification).

ZDHHC6 also forms a complex with selenoprotein K (SelK) at the ER membrane. This interaction is essential for the palmitoylation and function of the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP3R), a critical component in calcium signaling. The DHHC6/Selk complex stabilizes the palmitoyl-DHHC6 intermediate, enhancing its catalytic efficiency and influencing IP3R stability and function (Fredericks2014Stable).

Additionally, ZDHHC6 interacts with proteins such as Bip and BAP31, which are involved in ER functions. These interactions are influenced by the palmitoylation state of ZDHHC6, which affects its localization and assembly into higher-order structures within the ER (Abrami2017Identification). These interactions highlight ZDHHC6's role in modulating protein function and stability through palmitoylation.
