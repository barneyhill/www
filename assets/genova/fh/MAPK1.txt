# MAPK1

## Overview
MAPK1, also known as ERK2, is a gene that encodes the mitogen-activated protein kinase 1, a serine/threonine kinase integral to the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. This protein plays a pivotal role in transducing extracellular signals into intracellular responses, thereby regulating a variety of cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and survival (Roskoski2012ERK1/2; Burotto2014The). The MAPK1 gene is located on chromosome 22 and is highly conserved across species, underscoring its essential function in cellular signaling (Kaur2017MAPK1). The protein's activity is modulated through phosphorylation, which triggers conformational changes necessary for its interaction with various substrates and regulatory proteins (Motta2020Enhanced). Dysregulation of MAPK1 has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (ReyesGibby2016MAPK1ERK2; Motta2020Enhanced).

## Structure
MAPK1, also known as ERK2, is a serine/threonine kinase with a well-defined molecular structure. The protein consists of a kinase domain that spans residues 25-313, featuring two lobes: a small N-terminal lobe and a large C-terminal lobe. The N-terminal lobe includes a five-stranded antiparallel beta sheet and a glycine-rich loop that interacts with ATP phosphates, crucial for its catalytic activity (Motta2020Enhanced). The C-terminal lobe contains six conserved segments and four short conserved beta strands, housing most of the catalytic residues (Motta2020Enhanced).

The activation segment of MAPK1 includes phosphorylatable residues Thr185 and Tyr187, which are essential for its regulation and activation (Motta2020Enhanced). Phosphorylation of these residues induces conformational changes that stabilize the active conformation of the protein, particularly through interactions like the Glu71-Lys54 salt bridge (Motta2020Enhanced).

MAPK1 also features key interaction regions, such as the D-site recruitment site (DRS) and the F-site recruitment site (FRS), which mediate binding with substrates and regulators (Motta2020Enhanced). These structural elements are critical for the protein's function in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. The protein's structure is further characterized by a compact enzyme form that lacks regulatory domains, yet maintains high specificity in substrate interactions (Canagarajah1997Activation).

## Function
MAPK1, also known as ERK2, is a critical component of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, which regulates various cellular processes in healthy human cells. This serine/threonine kinase is activated through a series of phosphorylation events initiated by upstream kinases, such as MEK1/2, in response to stimuli like growth factors, cytokines, and stress (Roskoski2012ERK1/2; Burotto2014The). Once activated, MAPK1 translocates to the nucleus, where it phosphorylates a wide range of substrates, including transcription factors such as c-Jun, c-Fos, and Elk-1, thereby influencing gene expression and promoting cell cycle progression (Burotto2014The; Pearson2001Mitogen-Activated).

In the cytoplasm, MAPK1 is involved in regulating cell movement and metabolism by phosphorylating proteins that affect cytoskeletal dynamics and cell migration (Kolch2005Coordinating). The spatial localization of MAPK1 within the cell determines its target substrates and effects, with its nuclear activity being crucial for the transcriptional activation of genes necessary for cell proliferation and differentiation (Roskoski2012ERK1/2; Burotto2014The). The pathway's precise regulation is essential for maintaining normal cellular functions and responses, including immune response and inflammation (Burotto2014The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MAPK1 gene, also known as ERK2, have been implicated in a range of diseases, particularly within the RASopathy clinical spectrum. These disorders are characterized by distinctive facial features, developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, and cardiac defects. Specific de novo missense variants in MAPK1 have been identified as causative factors for a neurodevelopmental disorder similar to Noonan Syndrome, a common RASopathy. These mutations lead to a gain-of-function behavior, resulting in enhanced MAPK signaling due to increased phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the kinase (Motta2020Enhanced).

The MAPK1 mutations disrupt normal interactions with regulatory proteins, such as MKP3, a phosphatase that negatively regulates ERK function. This disruption results in defective negative regulation and aberrant signaling, contributing to the pathogenesis of the associated disorders (Motta2020Enhanced). Additionally, MAPK1 has been associated with cancer pain in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, with specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) like rs8136867 showing significant associations with pain phenotypes (ReyesGibby2016MAPK1ERK2). These findings highlight the clinical significance of MAPK1 in both neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer-related conditions.

## Interactions
MAPK1, also known as ERK2, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in signal transduction pathways. In Leishmania donovani, MAPK1 interacts with the HSP90 foldosome complex, which includes HSP90, HSP70, STI1, and SGT. These interactions were confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis. MAPK1 directly interacts with HSP90 and HSP70, as evidenced by the disruption of interactions with STI1 and SGT upon treatment with geldanamycin, an HSP90 inhibitor (Kaur2017MAPK1).

MAPK1 also phosphorylates HSP70 and HSP90, with phosphorylation occurring at serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues for HSP70, and at threonine and tyrosine residues for HSP90. This phosphorylation is crucial for regulating the stability and function of these chaperones (Kaur2017MAPK1).

In the context of gastric cancer, MAPK1 interacts with the MITF protein, phosphorylating it at serine 73, which enhances MITF's activity. This interaction was validated through immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence assays (Wang2022MiR5855p).

In psoriasis, MAPK1 is part of a hub motif in the apoptosis-related protein interaction network, interacting with proteins like MAPK3 and RELA, and playing a role in the MAPK/ERK signaling cascade (Farahani2024Integrating).
