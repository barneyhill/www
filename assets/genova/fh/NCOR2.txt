# NCOR2

## Overview
NCOR2, or nuclear receptor corepressor 2, is a gene that encodes a pivotal regulatory protein involved in transcriptional repression. The protein, also known as the silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT), functions as a corepressor by interacting with various nuclear receptors and transcription factors. It plays a crucial role in modulating gene expression through the recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and other chromatin-modifying enzymes, leading to chromatin condensation and transcriptional inhibition. NCOR2 is integral to numerous cellular processes, including metabolism, inflammation, and development, and its activity is regulated by alternative splicing and post-translational modifications. The protein's interactions and regulatory capabilities make it a significant player in maintaining genomic stability and influencing disease pathogenesis, particularly in cancer (Paluvai2023Insights; Jiang2001Genomic; Mottis2013Emerging).

## Structure
NCOR2, also known as the silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT), is a large regulatory protein involved in transcriptional repression. It has a complex molecular structure characterized by several functional domains. The N-terminus of NCOR2 contains three repression domains (RD1, RD2, and RD3) that interact with epigenome-modifying enzymes and chromatin remodelers (Sun2020Nuclear). These domains are crucial for its role in gene repression, as they recruit additional proteins to form a large corepressor holocomplex (Jafari2022Nuclear).

NCOR2 also features two SANT domains, which are essential for its interaction with histone deacetylases (HDACs) such as HDAC3, HDAC4, HDAC5, and HDAC7 (Battaglia2010Transcription; Jafari2022Nuclear). The C-terminus of NCOR2 includes two interaction domains (ID1 and ID2) that facilitate interactions with various nuclear receptors (Sun2020Nuclear).

NCOR2 undergoes significant alternative splicing, resulting in multiple protein variants that influence its function and interaction with nuclear receptors (Jafari2022Nuclear). These splice variants allow for a diverse range of interactions and regulatory capabilities, contributing to the protein's functional versatility in transcriptional repression.

## Function
NCOR2, also known as the silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT), is a critical component in transcriptional regulation. It functions as a corepressor by forming complexes with histone deacetylases (HDACs), such as HDAC3, and other proteins like sin3A/B, GPS2, TBL1, and TBLR1, to repress gene expression by deacetylating histones, leading to chromatin condensation and transcriptional inhibition (Jiang2001Genomic; Mottis2013Emerging).

NCOR2 is involved in various cellular processes, including metabolism, inflammation, and development. It regulates metabolic pathways by interacting with nuclear receptors and transcription factors, influencing glucose and lipid homeostasis, and is implicated in the regulation of adipogenesis and mitochondrial oxidative metabolism (Paluvai2023Insights; Mottis2013Emerging). In the context of inflammation, NCOR2 represses proinflammatory genes by interacting with transcription factors such as NF-kB (Mottis2013Emerging).

NCOR2 is active in the nucleus, where it acts as a docking platform for additional regulatory proteins, exemplifying its role in the complex regulation of transcriptional activity and maintaining genomic stability (Mottis2013Emerging). Its function is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which affect its activity and localization (Mottis2013Emerging).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NCOR2 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In breast cancer, NCOR2/SMRT is identified as an independent prognostic indicator of poor outcomes. Its expression is significantly correlated with distant metastases and local recurrence, suggesting that changes in NCOR2 expression are associated with adverse patient outcomes (Green2008Prognostic). 

In spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), the methylation levels of NCOR2 correlate with disease severity. Specifically, hypermethylation in the 5'UTR region of NCOR2 is observed in SMA patients, with significant differences noted in male patients. These methylation changes may influence the severity of SMA, although no significant differences in NCOR2 expression levels were observed between different SMA types (Zheleznyakova2015Methylation).

NCOR2 is also involved in gene fusions associated with certain tumors. Recurrent fusions between NCOR2 and HMGA2 have been identified in osteoclastic giant cell-rich tumors of bone, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of these tumors (PANAGOPOULOS2022Recurrent). Additionally, a novel NCOR2-NTRK1 fusion has been detected in lung adenocarcinoma, which may contribute to chemoresistance and tumor growth (Zhang2021A).

## Interactions
NCOR2, also known as nuclear receptor corepressor 2, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role as a transcriptional corepressor. It forms complexes with histone deacetylases (HDACs), particularly HDAC3, to facilitate chromatin remodeling and transcriptional repression. This interaction is crucial for maintaining HDAC3 enzymatic activity, and disruption can lead to metabolic dysfunctions (Paluvai2023Insights).

In lung adenocarcinoma, NCOR2 interacts with the ubiquitin ligase CHAF1B, which promotes its ubiquitination and degradation, contributing to cisplatin resistance. This interaction primarily occurs in the nucleus, and knockdown of CHAF1B increases NCOR2 expression, enhancing cisplatin sensitivity (Gong2020Ubiquitin).

NCOR2 also interacts with HP1γ, a histone methylation reader protein, in lung adenocarcinoma. HP1γ downregulates NCOR2, which is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis (Alam2018HP1γ).

In ovarian cancer, NCOR2 is involved in the regulation of the p53/p21 pathway through its interaction with CBX3. CBX3 downregulates NCOR2, affecting cell proliferation and metabolism (Chen2022CBX3).
