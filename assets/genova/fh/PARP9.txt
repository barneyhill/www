# PARP9

## Overview
PARP9, or poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase family member 9, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly within the immune system. The protein, also known as B-aggressive lymphoma 1 (BAL1), is a member of the PARP family and is characterized by its unique structural features, including a 'split' KH domain and functional Macro domains that facilitate ADP-ribose binding (Suskiewicz2023Updated). Unlike other PARP family members, PARP9 lacks catalytic activity but plays a regulatory role in macrophage signaling by modulating ADP-ribosylation (Iwata2016PARP9). It is involved in enhancing interferon-stimulated gene expression and antiviral defense, often forming a complex with DTX3L, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, to mediate chromatin remodeling and immune responses (Zhang2015PARP9DTX3L). PARP9's interactions with other proteins, such as STAT1, further underscore its role in immune regulation and its potential implications in cancer and infectious diseases (Zhang2015PARP9DTX3L).

## Structure
PARP9, also known as B-aggressive lymphoma 1 (BAL1), is a member of the PARP family and is part of clade 3. It contains a 'split' KH domain with a large insertion that includes functional Macro domains, which serve as ADP-ribose binding domains. The KH domain, named after the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) K, primarily functions as a sequence-specific RNA-binding module (Suskiewicz2023Updated). 

PARP9 is a monomer in solution, as confirmed by analytical size exclusion chromatography and multi-angle light scattering, with an observed molecular weight of 94 kDa, close to the theoretical weight of 96 kDa (Ashok2021Reconstitution). The protein lacks catalytic activity but can suppress ADP-ribosylation induced by PARP14, indicating a regulatory role in macrophage signaling (Iwata2016PARP9).

The presence of nucleic acid-binding domains in PARP9 suggests a role in recognizing specific long DNA or RNA ligands, which may imply a connection between ADP-ribosylation and RNA biology (Suskiewicz2023Updated). The structural domains of PARP9 and its behavior in solution are crucial for understanding its role in the DTX3L-PARP9 complex (Ashok2021Reconstitution).

## Function
PARP9, also known as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase family member 9, plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in the immune response and antiviral defense. In healthy human cells, PARP9 is involved in enhancing interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression and antiviral function. It forms a complex with DTX3L, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which targets histones for ubiquitination, leading to chromatin remodeling and increased ISG expression (Zhang2015PARP9DTX3L).

PARP9 also acts as a noncanonical sensor for RNA viruses in dendritic cells, initiating and amplifying type I interferon production independently of the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) pathway. This function is crucial for the innate immune response against RNA virus infections, as PARP9 can recognize and bind viral RNA, activating the PI3K and AKT3 pathways, which are essential for downstream signaling and immune response (Xing2021Identification).

In macrophages, PARP9 promotes pro-inflammatory responses via the IFNg-STAT1 pathway, enhancing STAT1 phosphorylation and activation. This activity suggests that PARP9 plays a role in regulating immune responses and maintaining homeostasis in healthy human cells (Iwata2016PARP9).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PARP9 gene have been linked to various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and immune responses. In gliomas, high PARP9 expression is associated with poor prognosis and advanced clinicopathological features. It is also correlated with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint molecules, suggesting a role in tumor immune evasion and as a potential target for immunotherapy (Xu2020Molecular). In breast cancer, PARP9 is frequently overexpressed and is associated with increased cancer cell migration and metastasis, indicating its involvement in cancer progression (Tang2018PARP9).

PARP9 also plays a significant role in the immune response to infections. It is involved in regulating type I interferon production, which is crucial for antiviral defense. Alterations in PARP9 expression can impact the immune response to viral infections, potentially affecting clinical outcomes (Xing2021Identification; Zhang2015PARP9DTX3L). In the context of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, PARP9 is necessary for controlling the infection, and its deficiency leads to increased bacterial burden and lung inflammation, highlighting its protective role (Thirunavukkarasu2023Poly(ADPribose) page 1 of 10). These findings underscore the clinical significance of PARP9 in both cancer and infectious diseases.

## Interactions
PARP9 interacts with DTX3L to form a high-affinity heterodimer complex that plays significant roles in ubiquitination and ADP-ribosylation. The D3 domain of DTX3L is crucial for its interaction with PARP9, exhibiting nanomolar affinity, and this interaction is essential for the complex's enzymatic functions, including E3 ligase and ADP-ribosyl transferase activities (Ashok2021Reconstitution). The complex is involved in various cellular processes, such as DNA damage response and antiviral response, and is overexpressed in certain cancers (Ashok2021Reconstitution).

PARP9 also interacts with STAT1, enhancing interferon signaling and controlling viral infections. This interaction is mediated by specific domains within PARP9 and DTX3L, with PARP9 binding to STAT1 through its Macro1-Macro2 and PARP domains (Zhang2015PARP9DTX3L). The PARP9-DTX3L complex targets host histone H2BJ and viral 3C proteases, promoting the expression of interferon-stimulated genes and enhancing the immune response against viral infections (Zhang2015PARP9DTX3L).

In macrophages, PARP9 interacts with PARP14, and these proteins cross-regulate macrophage activation through STAT1 ADP-ribosylation, with implications for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases (Iwata2016PARP9).
