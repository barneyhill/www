# VPS35L

## Overview
VPS35L is a gene that encodes the VPS35 endosomal protein sorting factor like, a critical component of the Retriever complex involved in endosomal recycling. The protein plays a pivotal role in the recycling of membrane proteins, maintaining cellular homeostasis and signaling. Structurally, VPS35L is characterized by an α/α solenoid fold and a unique N-terminal 'belt' sequence that stabilizes its interaction with other components of the Retriever complex, such as VPS29. Functionally, VPS35L is essential for endosomal cargo recycling and autophagy, with its activity being crucial for early embryonic development and cellular processes like receptor recycling and membrane trafficking. Mutations in VPS35L are linked to various disorders, including a syndrome similar to 3C/Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance (Otsuji2022Clinical; Kato2019Biallelic; Boesch2023Structural).

## Structure
VPS35L is a key component of the Retriever complex, which is involved in endosomal recycling. The protein adopts an α/α solenoid fold comprising 32 α-helices, contributing to its compact and twisted conformation (Boesch2023Structural). A unique feature of VPS35L is its N-terminal 'belt' sequence, which wraps around its C-terminal region and the bound VPS29, playing a crucial role in stabilizing the complex. This 'belt' sequence is absent in the Retromer complex, highlighting structural differences between Retriever and Retromer (Boesch2023Structural).

The CCDC22-CCDC93 dimer interacts with VPS35L, forming an extended heterodimer with four coiled coils. The last two and a half-coiled coils (CC2b, CC3, and CC4) interact with a conserved surface at the outer ridge of the C-terminal region of VPS35L, which is crucial for the structural integrity of the Retriever-CCC complex (Boesch2023Structural).

Mutations in VPS35L, particularly in the 'belt' sequence, can disrupt its interaction with VPS29 and other CCC components, affecting the assembly and function of the Retriever complex (Boesch2023Structural). These mutations are associated with various disorders, including cancer and developmental syndromes (Otsuji2022Clinical; Kato2019Biallelic).

## Function
VPS35L is a crucial component of the retriever complex, which is involved in the recycling of membrane proteins in healthy human cells. This complex, formed by the interaction of VPS35L with proteins such as VPS29 and DSCR3, is essential for the proper recycling of membrane proteins like ITGA5 and ITGB1, maintaining cellular homeostasis and signaling (Kato2019Biallelic). VPS35L also plays a significant role in endosomal cargo recycling, interacting with the CCC and WASH complexes to facilitate the recycling of integral membrane proteins, preventing their degradation in lysosomes (Kato2019Biallelic).

In addition to its role in protein recycling, VPS35L is involved in autophagy. Knockout studies in HeLa cells have shown that the absence of VPS35L leads to decreased autophagic flux, indicating its importance in maintaining autophagic activity (Kato2019Biallelic). VPS35L is also critical for early embryonic development, as evidenced by the embryonic lethality observed in Vps35l knockout mice, highlighting its essential role in developmental processes (Kato2019Biallelic).

VPS35L is active in the cytoplasm and endosomes, where it contributes to cellular processes like receptor recycling and membrane trafficking, impacting cellular homeostasis and signaling (Otsuji2022Clinical).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the VPS35L gene are associated with a syndrome similar to 3C/Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome (3C/RSS), characterized by congenital cranio-cerebello-cardiac dysplasia. This condition includes symptoms such as craniofacial anomalies, cerebellar malformations, cardiac defects, coloboma, microphthalmia, and skeletal malformations (Otsuji2022Clinical; Kato2019Biallelic). The syndrome results from biallelic pathogenic variants in VPS35L, which lead to dysfunction of the retriever complex, a crucial component in endosomal cargo recycling (Kato2019Biallelic). The instability of the VPS35L protein, particularly the A919T variant, disrupts its interaction with VPS29, preventing the formation of the retriever complex and impairing autophagy (Kato2019Biallelic).

VPS35L mutations also affect lipid metabolism, contributing to conditions such as hypercholesterolemia. This is due to impaired expression of lipoprotein receptors like LDLR and LRP1, leading to reduced LDL uptake (Otsuji2022Clinical). Additionally, VPS35L-associated Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome can present with immunological issues, including hypogammaglobulinemia and common variable immunodeficiency, which may require immune globulin therapy (Otsuji2022Clinical). The severity of these clinical manifestations often correlates with the expression levels of VPS35L protein (Otsuji2022Clinical).

## Interactions
VPS35L is a core component of the retriever complex, which is involved in endosomal protein sorting and recycling. It forms a heterotrimeric complex with VPS29 and DSCR3, essential for maintaining plasma membrane homeostasis by recycling cell surface proteins and preventing their degradation in lysosomes (Kato2019Biallelic). The VPS35L-A919T variant is unable to co-immunoprecipitate with VPS29, leading to instability and dysfunction of the retriever complex (Kato2019Biallelic). This interaction is crucial for the proper functioning of the retriever complex and endosomal cargo recycling, with implications for conditions like 3C/Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome (Kato2019Biallelic).

VPS35L also interacts with the CCC and WASH complexes, which are involved in autophagy and protein sorting. These interactions are necessary for the recycling of lipoprotein receptor proteins, such as the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and LRP1, which are critical for lipid metabolism and cellular uptake processes (Otsuji2022Clinical). Disruptions in these interactions due to VPS35L variants can lead to impaired endosomal protein sorting and contribute to the pathogenesis of Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome (Otsuji2022Clinical).
