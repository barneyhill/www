# LYPD4

## Overview
LYPD4 is a gene that encodes the protein LY6/PLAUR domain containing 4, which is a member of the Ly6/uPAR family. This family is characterized by the presence of a LU domain, known for its three-fingered folding topology, which is crucial for the protein's stability and function (Loughner2016Organization; Leth2019Evolution). Unlike some other members of its family, LYPD4 lacks a GPI-anchor signal peptide, indicating it is not membrane-tethered (Loughner2016Organization). The protein is specifically expressed in the testis and localized in the acrosomes of sperm, where it plays a vital role in male fertility by facilitating sperm migration and binding to the zona pellucida during fertilization (Wang2020LYPD4). LYPD4 is involved in stabilizing the ADAM protein complex on the sperm surface, which is essential for these processes (Wang2020LYPD4). The gene and its encoded protein are conserved across mammals, including humans and mice, underscoring their evolutionary significance in reproductive biology (Wang2020LYPD4).

## Structure
LYPD4 is a member of the Ly6/uPAR family, characterized by the presence of a LU domain, which typically exhibits a three-fingered folding topology with three long loops projecting from a disulfide-rich core (Loughner2016Organization; Leth2019Evolution). The LU domain is defined by a consensus sequence of 60-90 residues with specific disulfide bonds, contributing to the protein's stability and function (Leth2019Evolution). 

LYPD4 lacks a GPI-anchor signal peptide, as predicted by the 'Pre-dGPI' program, indicating it is not membrane-tethered like some other Ly6/uPAR family proteins (Loughner2016Organization). The protein is expressed specifically in the testis and is localized in the acrosomes of human and mouse sperm, playing a crucial role in fertilization (Wang2020LYPD4). 

During sperm maturation, LYPD4 undergoes a size change, possibly due to the loss of small peptides, as indicated by mass spectrometry analysis, which identified nine signature peptides in mouse LYPD4, excluding the first 38 N-terminal and the last 27 C-terminal amino acids (Wang2020LYPD4). This suggests potential post-translational modifications or peptide loss during maturation. The protein's role in stabilizing the ADAM complex on the sperm acrosomal membrane is crucial for sperm migration and zona pellucida binding, essential for male fertility (Wang2020LYPD4).

## Function
LYPD4 is a gene that encodes a protein specifically expressed in the testes and sperm, playing a crucial role in male fertility. The protein is a member of the LY6/uPAR family and is conserved across mammals, including humans and mice. In humans, LYPD4 is localized in the equatorial segment of mature sperm, suggesting its involvement in sperm function and fertilization processes (Wang2020LYPD4).

LYPD4 is identified as an acrosomal protein, which is essential for sperm migration and binding to the zona pellucida, a critical step in fertilization. In mice, knockout studies have shown that the absence of Lypd4 leads to male infertility due to defects in sperm migration through the female reproductive tract and impaired binding to the zona pellucida (Wang2020LYPD4). The protein is involved in anchoring the ADAM protein complex on the sperm surface, which is crucial for these processes (Wang2020LYPD4).

LYPD4 undergoes post-translational modifications during sperm maturation in the epididymis, indicating its dynamic role in sperm development and function (Wang2020LYPD4). The protein's interaction with other sperm membrane complexes suggests its importance in maintaining sperm fertilizing ability (Wang2020LYPD4).

## Interactions
LYPD4 is a protein that plays a crucial role in sperm function, particularly in sperm migration and fertilization. It is involved in interactions with the ADAM protein complex, which is essential for sperm migration and binding to the zona pellucida. Although a direct interaction between LYPD4 and ADAM3 has not been detected, LYPD4 is believed to interact with other members of the ADAM complex to stabilize it. In Lypd4 knockout mice, there is a significant reduction in ADAM3 and other ADAM proteins, such as ADAM5, ADAM4, and ADAM6b, indicating LYPD4's role in maintaining these proteins (Wang2020LYPD4).

LYPD4 may also interact with proteins like ACE, LY6K, and CMTM2A/B, which have been shown to affect sperm function and localization in other knockout models (Fujihara2019Identification). Additionally, LYPD4 is associated with CD55 in a Ca2+-dependent process, although they do not co-localize on the sperm surface. This interaction is complex and may involve regulatory mechanisms that influence sperm fertilization ability (Watanabe2024Ca2+evoked). These interactions highlight LYPD4's role in forming and maintaining protein complexes crucial for sperm function and male fertility.
