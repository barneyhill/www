# EXTL2

## Overview
The EXTL2 gene encodes the protein exostosin-like glycosyltransferase 2, which is a type II transmembrane glycosyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) (Kitagawa1999The). This enzyme plays a crucial role in the initiation of heparan sulfate synthesis by transferring N-acetylgalactosamine and N-acetylglucosamine to the glycosaminoglycan-protein linkage region (Kitagawa1999The). EXTL2 is primarily active in the Golgi apparatus, where it contributes to the modification and maturation of proteoglycans, impacting cellular functions such as signaling and structural integrity (Kitagawa1999The). The protein's activity is essential for maintaining normal cellular functions and tissue homeostasis, as it regulates the synthesis and sorting of GAGs, which are key components of the extracellular matrix and cell surfaces (Kitagawa1999The). Additionally, EXTL2 has been implicated in neuroinflammatory conditions, such as multiple sclerosis, due to its role in limiting the production of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, which are known to inhibit axonal regeneration (Pu2020The).

## Structure
The EXTL2 protein is involved in glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis and functions as an α1,4-N-acetylhexosaminyltransferase. It has a single open reading frame of 990 base pairs, coding for a protein of 330 amino acids (Kitagawa1999The). The protein includes one potential N-glycosylation site and exhibits a type II transmembrane protein topology, which is characteristic of many glycosyltransferases (Kitagawa1999The). The EXTL2 protein is structurally characterized by its GT64 domain, which adopts a GT-A fold and binds UDP-GlcNAc or UDP-GalNAc with the aid of a manganese cofactor (Wilson2022The). EXTL2 exists as a symmetric homodimer, similar to the mouse EXTL2 GT64-domain homodimer, suggesting a conserved interaction mode among exostosins (Wilson2022The).

The enzyme's activity is associated with its role in transferring N-acetylgalactosamine and N-acetylglucosamine to the glycosaminoglycan-protein linkage region, contributing to the initiation of heparan sulfate synthesis (Kitagawa1999The). The EXTL2 protein also exhibits α1,4-GlcNAc transferase activity, which is involved in heparan sulfate biosynthesis (Kitagawa1999The). The soluble form of the enzyme, generated by replacing the first 57 amino acids with a cleavable insulin signal sequence, is secreted as a 66-kDa protein, which reduces to 60-kDa after N-glycosidase treatment, indicating utilization of the N-linked glycosylation site (Kitagawa1999The).

## Function
The EXTL2 gene encodes an enzyme known as α1,4-N-acetylhexosaminyltransferase, which plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in human cells. This enzyme is involved in transferring N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to the glycosaminoglycan-protein linkage region, specifically to the tetrasaccharide-serine structure GlcAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xylβ1-O-Ser, which is essential for the initiation of heparan sulfate synthesis (Kitagawa1999The). EXTL2 is primarily active in the Golgi apparatus, where it contributes to the modification and maturation of proteoglycans, impacting cell signaling, proliferation, and structural integrity (Kitagawa1999The).

In healthy cells, EXTL2 functions to regulate the synthesis and sorting of GAGs, which are crucial components of the extracellular matrix and cell surfaces. This regulation is vital for maintaining normal cellular functions and tissue homeostasis, as GAGs interact with various proteins through specific saccharide sequences (Kitagawa1999The). EXTL2 also plays a role in limiting the production of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), which are part of the extracellular matrix and known to inhibit axonal regeneration and remyelination (Pu2020The).

## Clinical Significance
The EXTL2 gene, encoding exostosin-like glycosyltransferase 2, has been implicated in various neuroinflammatory conditions, particularly multiple sclerosis (MS). Genetic variations in EXTL2 are associated with increased deposition of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) in demyelinated lesions, which can exacerbate axonal damage and enhance microglia/macrophage activity, contributing to the pathology of MS (Pu2020The). In EXTL2-deficient mice, there is excessive CSPG accumulation, promoting neuroinflammation and axonal injury, suggesting that EXTL2 plays a protective role in limiting inflammation and lesion expansion after central nervous system (CNS) injury (Pu2020The).

The study of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in MS databases identified significant associations with MS, mapping to the region containing EXTL2, indicating potential MS susceptibility variants (Pu2020The). However, the precise genetic contribution of EXTL2 to MS progression remains challenging to assess without well-powered genetic studies (Pu2020The).

EXTL2's role in regulating CSPG synthesis and deposition suggests its involvement in neuroinflammatory responses, which could have broader implications for conditions involving demyelination and CNS injury (Pu2020The). Further research is needed to fully understand its role and therapeutic potential in these conditions.
