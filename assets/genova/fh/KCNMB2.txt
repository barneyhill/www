# KCNMB2

## Overview
The KCNMB2 gene encodes the potassium calcium-activated channel subfamily M regulatory beta subunit 2, a critical component of large conductance Ca2+- and voltage-activated potassium (BK) channels. These channels are integral membrane proteins that play a pivotal role in regulating cellular excitability by modulating potassium ion flow across the cell membrane. The protein encoded by KCNMB2, often referred to as the β2 subunit, is characterized by its 'ball-and-chain' domain, which is essential for the fast inactivation of BK channels, a process that influences the channel's functional dynamics (Bentrop2001NMR; Wallner1999Molecular). The β2 subunit also contains transmembrane domains and endocytic sorting signals that regulate the surface expression and internalization of the channel, thereby affecting its physiological roles in various tissues, including smooth muscle and the brain (Zarei2007Endocytic). Alterations in the KCNMB2 gene have been associated with clinical conditions such as hyperaldosteronism and the pharmacogenomics of preterm labor treatment, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Yoon2020Effects; Larsen2016Hyperaldosteronism).

## Structure
The KCNMB2 gene encodes the β2 subunit of large conductance Ca2+- and voltage-activated potassium channels (BK channels). The protein's structure is characterized by a 'ball-and-chain' domain, which is crucial for the fast inactivation of BK channels. This domain consists of two parts: the 'ball domain' (residues 1-17) and the 'chain domain' (residues 20-45), connected by a flexible linker. The 'ball domain' features a flexible N terminus anchored at a loop-helix motif, while the 'chain domain' is a 4-turn helix with an unfolded region at its C terminus (Bentrop2001NMR).

The β2 subunit also contains two transmembrane domains and endocytic sorting signals located near the C-terminus, which regulate the surface expression of the channel by promoting internalization and targeting to endosomes (Zarei2007Endocytic). These signals include overlapping tyrosine- and dileucine-based motifs, which are crucial for the subunit's regulatory function (Zarei2007Endocytic).

The β2 subunit's structure and associated signals play a significant role in modulating the functional and pharmacological properties of the BK channel's α subunit, affecting cellular excitability and vascular tone (Zarei2007Endocytic).

## Function
The KCNMB2 gene encodes the β2-subunit of large conductance Ca2+- and voltage-activated potassium (BK) channels, which are crucial for regulating cell excitability and providing feedback to control Ca2+ influx. The β2-subunit is essential for endowing the non-inactivating BK channel with fast inactivation, a process mediated by the 'ball-and-chain' mechanism involving the N terminus of KCNMB2. This mechanism is characterized by a slow dissociation rate and high affinity, similar to the inactivation observed in voltage-gated potassium channels (Bentrop2001NMR).

KCNMB2 also plays a significant role in modulating the surface expression of the BK channel's pore-forming α subunit (hSlo) through endocytic trafficking signals. These signals can decrease hSlo surface expression, suggesting a regulatory mechanism for channel expression via endocytosis. This modulation is important for the physiological roles of BK channels in different tissues, such as controlling vascular tone in smooth muscle and contributing to neural transmission in the brain (Zarei2007Endocytic).

In the context of colonic K+ secretion, KCNMB2 influences the activation and inactivation properties of the KCa1.1 channel, increasing its Ca2+ sensitivity and mediating rapid inactivation through its N-terminal ball-and-chain domain (Larsen2017Intact).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the KCNMB2 gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions. In the context of preterm labor, polymorphisms in the KCNMB2 gene have been associated with the efficacy and adverse drug events of ritodrine therapy. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) such as rs7624046 and rs9839376 are linked to a higher hazard of earlier delivery, while rs7625907 is associated with a reduced incidence of adverse drug events (Yoon2020Effects).

In the realm of renal physiology, KCNMB2 knockout mice exhibit hyperaldosteronism due to decreased renal potassium excretion. This condition is characterized by elevated plasma aldosterone levels, which are not due to primary aldosteronism but rather a compensatory mechanism to maintain potassium balance. These findings suggest that alterations in KCNMB2 expression or function could mimic conditions of primary hyperaldosteronism, potentially affecting aldosterone regulation and potassium homeostasis (Larsen2016Hyperaldosteronism).

However, studies investigating the association of KCNMB2 with neurological conditions such as hippocampal sclerosis and limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathological change (LATE-NC) have not found significant links, indicating that KCNMB2 may not play a major role in these disorders (Dugan2021Analysis).

## Interactions
The KCNMB2 gene encodes the β2 subunit of large conductance voltage and calcium-activated potassium (MaxiK) channels, which interact with the pore-forming α subunit (hSlo) to modulate channel activity. This interaction influences the surface expression and internalization of the hSlo channel. When coexpressed with hSlo, the β2 subunit induces a punctuated expression pattern, suggesting colocalization and potential interaction within vesicles. This interaction leads to the internalization of both hSlo and β2, targeting them to an endosomal compartment, as indicated by colocalization with the endosomal marker RhoB GTPase (Zarei2007Endocytic).

The β2 subunit also plays a role in the inactivation of MaxiK channels. It contains an N-terminal inactivation domain that acts as an inactivating 'ball' peptide, occluding the K+ conducting pore of the α subunit. This mechanism is similar to the 'ball and chain' inactivation seen in other voltage-dependent K+ channels. The β2 subunit's N-terminal peptide can induce fast inactivating currents when coexpressed with the α subunit, highlighting its role in modulating channel inactivation (Wallner1999Molecular).
