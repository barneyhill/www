# VSTM1

## Overview
VSTM1, or V-set and transmembrane domain containing 1, is a gene that encodes proteins involved in immune regulation. The gene produces two primary isoforms: VSTM1-v1 and VSTM1-v2. VSTM1-v1 is a type I transmembrane protein characterized by an extracellular immunoglobulin V-like (IgV-like) domain and two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs), which play a role in inhibitory immune signaling by recruiting phosphatases such as SHP-1 and SHP-2 (LI2014Vset). In contrast, VSTM1-v2 is a secretory glycoprotein that functions similarly to a cytokine, promoting IL-17A secretion by CD4+ T cells and influencing Th17 cell differentiation (Liu2016Enhanced; Guo2012VSTM1v2). The differential expression and function of these isoforms underscore the gene's significance in modulating immune responses and its potential implications in various immune-related diseases (Zhou2016Synergistic).

## Structure
The VSTM1 gene encodes two primary isoforms: VSTM1-v1 and VSTM1-v2. VSTM1-v1 is a type I transmembrane protein composed of 236 amino acids. It features an extracellular immunoglobulin V-like (IgV-like) domain and two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) in its cytoplasmic region, suggesting a role in inhibitory immune signaling (LI2014Vset; Li2013Preparation). The ITIM motifs are involved in recruiting phosphatases such as SHP-1 and SHP-2, which can downregulate cell activation (LI2014Vset).

VSTM1-v2, in contrast, is a secretory glycoprotein lacking the transmembrane domain, consisting of 205 amino acids. It is characterized by three N-glycosylation sites, which contribute to its molecular mass of approximately 55 kDa due to glycosylation (Guo2012VSTM1v2). VSTM1-v2 is secreted via the classical ER/Golgi pathway and functions similarly to a cytokine, promoting IL-17A secretion by CD4+ T cells (Liu2016Enhanced; Guo2012VSTM1v2).

Both isoforms share an IgV-like domain, which is a common structural motif in immune system proteins, and are subject to post-translational modifications such as glycosylation (Liu2016Enhanced; Guo2012VSTM1v2).

## Function
The VSTM1 gene encodes a protein involved in immune system regulation, primarily expressed in immune cells such as monocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. VSTM1 has multiple variants, with VSTM1-v1 and VSTM1-v2 being the most functionally predominant. VSTM1-v1, also known as signal inhibitory receptor on leukocytes-1 (SIRL-1), is a type I membrane protein that negatively regulates neutrophil activity through its extracellular IgV-like domain and two ITIM motifs in its cytoplasmic tail (LI2014Vset; Zhou2016Synergistic). These motifs recruit phosphatases like SHP-1 and SHP-2, inhibiting signaling pathways involved in immune responses (LI2014Vset).

VSTM1-v2, in contrast, is a soluble glycoprotein that promotes the differentiation and activation of Th17 cells by increasing IL-17A production in CD4+ T cells, suggesting a role in modulating immune responses, particularly in inflammatory conditions (Guo2012VSTM1v2). This variant is secreted via the classical ER/Golgi pathway and is N-glycosylated, indicating its function as a secreted cytokine (Guo2012VSTM1v2).

Overall, VSTM1 plays a crucial role in immune regulation and leukocyte differentiation, with its expression levels correlating with the maturation state of myeloid cells (Zhou2016Synergistic).

## Clinical Significance
The VSTM1 gene has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in immune regulation. Alterations in VSTM1 expression are associated with atopic dermatitis (AD), an inflammatory skin condition. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the VSTM1 promoter, rs612529, affects the expression of the signal inhibitory receptor on leukocytes-1 (SIRL-1). The C allele of this SNP is linked to increased methylation and reduced expression of SIRL-1 in monocytes, correlating with a higher risk of AD (Kumar2017A).

In hematopoietic malignancies, VSTM1 is often silenced due to promoter hypermethylation. This silencing is observed in various hematopoietic tumor cell lines and can be reversed by pharmacological demethylation, suggesting a potential role for VSTM1 as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in these cancers (LI2014Vset).

In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), VSTM1-v2, a splicing variant of VSTM1, is overexpressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and correlates with disease activity. This variant is associated with the differentiation of Th17 cells, which are central to RA pathogenesis (Wang2016Expression).

## Interactions
The VSTM1 gene encodes proteins that participate in various interactions influencing immune cell signaling. The VSTM1-v1 isoform is a type I transmembrane protein that contains two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) in its cytoplasmic region. These ITIMs interact with the sarcoma homology 2 domain of phosphatases, such as SHP-1 and SHP-2, leading to the inactivation of different kinases and downregulation of cell activation. This interaction helps prevent excessive immune reactions and maintain immune system balance (LI2014Vset).

VSTM1-v1 also inhibits fragment crystallizable epsilon receptor I-mediated signaling, which is involved in reactive oxygen species production and the microbicidal activity of phagocytes, through the recruitment of SHP phosphatases (LI2014Vset). The VSTM1-v2 isoform, a soluble glycoprotein, is suggested to function as a cytokine, promoting the differentiation and activation of Th17 cells, although specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed (Guo2012VSTM1v2).

The regulation of VSTM1 expression is influenced by a functional SNP, rs612529, which affects the binding of transcription factors PU.1 and YY1 to the VSTM1 promoter, demonstrating allele-specific binding and suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation (Kumar2017A).
