# PMCH

## Overview
The PMCH gene encodes the precursor protein pro-melanin-concentrating hormone, which is subsequently processed into several biologically active peptides, including melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), neuropeptide E-I (NEI), and neuropeptide G-E (NGE) (Bittencourt2018Neuroanatomical). MCH is a neuropeptide primarily active in the hypothalamus, where it plays a pivotal role in regulating energy homeostasis, appetite, and feeding behavior by interacting with its receptors, MCHR1 and MCHR2, which are G protein-coupled receptors (Bittencourt2018Neuroanatomical; SegalLieberman2006Melaninconcentrating). Beyond its metabolic functions, PMCH expression in Th2 cells suggests a role in immune responses, potentially linking it to conditions such as obesity and asthma (Sandig2007Human). The gene's involvement in both metabolic and neurological pathways underscores its clinical significance, particularly in the context of disorders like obesity and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Bolborea2023Loss; MacNeil2013The).

## Structure
The PMCH gene encodes the precursor to melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), a neuropeptide involved in various physiological functions. The primary structure of the PMCH protein includes specific amino acid sequences that are processed into several peptides, including MCH and neuropeptide EI (NEI) (Breton1993Isolation). The PMCH protein sequence is predicted to have several functional domains, such as pro-MCH, CSP, IL7, and XPGI, along with low complexity sequences (Sun2013Molecular). 

The secondary structure of PMCH may include common motifs like alpha helices and beta sheets, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure refers to the overall three-dimensional shape of the protein, which is crucial for its function, but specific details are not mentioned. The quaternary structure, involving the assembly of multiple peptide chains, is not detailed in the provided context.

Post-translational modifications of the PMCH protein include phosphorylation, with eight predicted phosphorylation sites, but it lacks a signal peptide sequence, suggesting it is not secreted (Sun2013Molecular). The PMCH gene also exhibits splice variants, which may result in different isoforms with distinct functions, although specific isoforms are not detailed in the context (Breton1993Isolation).

## Function
The PMCH gene encodes the pro-melanin-concentrating hormone, which is processed into several peptides, including melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), neuropeptide E-I (NEI), and neuropeptide G-E (NGE) (Bittencourt2018Neuroanatomical). MCH is a 19-amino acid peptide primarily active in the hypothalamus, where it plays a crucial role in regulating energy homeostasis and appetite (SegalLieberman2006Melaninconcentrating). It influences feeding behavior and energy expenditure by binding to its receptors, MCHR1 and MCHR2, which are G protein-coupled receptors involved in these physiological processes (Bittencourt2018Neuroanatomical).

In humans, MCH is synthesized in the lateral hypothalamus and zona incerta regions of the brain and is involved in the modulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, influencing growth hormone secretion (SegalLieberman2006Melaninconcentrating). The PMCH gene is also expressed in Th2 cells, a subset of CD4+ T helper cells, suggesting a role in immune responses and potential links to metabolic conditions such as obesity and asthma (Sandig2007Human). The expression of PMCH in Th2 cells indicates its involvement in immune system processes, potentially acting similarly to Th2 cytokines (Sandig2007Human).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PMCH gene, which encodes the pro-melanin concentrating hormone, have been implicated in various metabolic and neurological conditions. In the context of energy homeostasis, PMCH expression is crucial during early development and puberty. Disruption of PMCH expression can lead to significant changes in body weight and energy balance. For instance, PMCH-deficient mice exhibit a lean phenotype with increased metabolic rates and resistance to diet-induced obesity, suggesting that PMCH plays a role in promoting energy storage and weight gain (MacNeil2013The; Marsh2002Melaninconcentrating).

In humans, while specific mutations in the PMCH gene have not been conclusively linked to obesity, variations in its expression may influence body mass index (BMI) in certain populations, such as those treated with antipsychotic medications like olanzapine (MacNeil2013The). Additionally, PMCH neurons in the lateral hypothalamus have been associated with neurodegenerative processes in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), where a reduction in PMCH-positive neurons correlates with the presence of phosphorylated TDP-43 pathology, suggesting a potential role in disease progression (Bolborea2023Loss). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PMCH in metabolic and neurological disorders.

## Interactions
The PMCH gene encodes the prepro-MCH protein, which is processed into several peptides, including melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), neuropeptide EI (NEI), and neuropeptide GE (NGE). These peptides are involved in neuropeptide signaling, although specific protein interactions are not detailed in the available context (Bittencourt2018Neuroanatomical). MCH operates through interactions with its receptors, MCHR1 and MCHR2, which are G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) involved in various physiological functions such as energy homeostasis and feeding behavior (Presse2014The).

MCH is known to modulate the activity of melanin-concentrating hormone neurons through inhibitory interactions. Histamine inhibits MCH neurons by activating the H3 receptor (H3R), which is a postsynaptic GPCR. This interaction is mediated through G protein-dependent inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels, leading to the hyperpolarization of the neurons' resting membrane potential (Parks2014Histamine). The inhibitory effects of histamine on MCH neurons are specific to the H3 receptor, as they are not observed with H1 or H2 receptor agonists (Parks2014Histamine). These interactions suggest a regulatory mechanism between histamine and MCH in sleep and arousal (Parks2014Histamine).
