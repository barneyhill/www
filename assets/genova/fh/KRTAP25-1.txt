# KRTAP25-1

## Overview
KRTAP25-1 is a gene that encodes the keratin-associated protein 25-1, which is a member of the keratin-associated protein (KAP) family. These proteins are integral components of the hair shaft, playing a crucial role in the formation and structural integrity of hair fibers. The KAP family is characterized by their high cysteine content, which facilitates the formation of disulfide bonds, contributing to the rigidity and resilience of hair. Keratin-associated protein 25-1 is specifically involved in the complex network of interactions that occur between keratin intermediate filaments and other KAPs, which are essential for the mechanical properties of hair. Variations in the KRTAP25-1 gene have been studied in relation to hair texture and other phenotypic traits, highlighting its significance in dermatological and genetic research (Qiu2020aarFDC).
