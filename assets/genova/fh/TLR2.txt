# TLR2

## Overview
TLR2 (Toll-like receptor 2) is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein toll-like receptor 2, which is a pivotal component of the innate immune system. This receptor is primarily involved in the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) from a diverse array of microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. TLR2 is expressed on the surface of various immune cells, such as monocytes, neutrophils, and mast cells, where it plays a crucial role in initiating immune responses by forming heterodimers with other toll-like receptors, such as TLR1 and TLR6, to broaden its ligand recognition capabilities (Colleselli2023An; Flo2001Differential). The protein's structure includes leucine-rich repeat (LRR) modules and a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain, which are essential for ligand binding and downstream signaling, respectively (Jin2008Structures). TLR2's involvement in immune responses extends to maintaining symbiotic relationships with commensal bacteria and contributing to the pathogenesis of various infectious and autoimmune diseases, underscoring its clinical significance (Round2011The; Liu2013TLR2).

## Structure
TLR2 (Toll-like receptor 2) is a protein that plays a crucial role in the innate immune system by recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns. The primary structure of TLR2 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains essential for its function. The secondary structure includes leucine-rich repeat (LRR) modules, which are responsible for ligand binding and form a horseshoe-like structure with a hydrophobic core (Jin2008Structures).

The tertiary structure of TLR2 involves the folding of these LRR modules into a three-domain architecture, comprising N-terminal, central, and C-terminal domains. The central domain is particularly important for ligand binding and receptor dimerization (Jin2007Crystal). TLR2's quaternary structure involves forming heterodimers with TLR1 or TLR6, which is essential for its signaling function. The TLR1-TLR2 heterodimer is stabilized by interactions with lipopeptides, such as Pam3CSK4, which bind at the interface of the two receptors (Jin2007Crystal).

TLR2 also contains a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain, which is crucial for downstream signaling. This domain has a common fold with a five-stranded beta sheet surrounded by alpha helices, and the BB loop within this domain is essential for dimerization and adaptor recruitment (Jin2008Structures). Common post-translational modifications of TLR2 include glycosylation and phosphorylation, which may influence its activity and interactions.

## Function
Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) is a critical component of the innate immune system, primarily involved in recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) from a variety of microorganisms, including gram-positive bacteria, mycoplasma, mycobacteria, and yeast. TLR2 is expressed on the surface of several immune cells, including monocytes, neutrophils, and mast cells, where it plays a pivotal role in initiating immune responses (Varadaradjalou2003Toll‐like; O’Mahony2008Differential; Flo2001Differential).

In monocytes and neutrophils, TLR2 expression can be up-regulated by cytokines such as GM-CSF and IFN-γ, enhancing the cells' ability to respond to microbial ligands. This up-regulation leads to increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-8 (IL-8), which is crucial for neutrophil activation and recruitment to infection sites (KurtJones2002Role). TLR2 also plays a role in the activation of mast cells, where it mediates the release of cytokines and histamine in response to bacterial components like peptidoglycan, contributing to a pro-Th2 immune response (Varadaradjalou2003Toll‐like).

TLR2 is also involved in maintaining symbiotic relationships with commensal bacteria in the gut, such as Bacteroides fragilis. It facilitates the colonization of these bacteria by promoting immunologic tolerance through interactions with regulatory T cells, thereby helping to suppress pro-inflammatory responses (Round2011The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the TLR2 gene have been implicated in various diseases. In tuberculosis, the TLR2 Arg753Gln polymorphism is associated with an increased risk, particularly in Turkish patients, where carriers have a 6.04-fold increased risk of developing the disease (Corr2009Genetic). TLR2 polymorphisms also influence susceptibility to pulmonary tuberculosis, with certain haplotypes linked to higher susceptibility and affecting natural killer cell counts (Chen2010Tolllike).

In autoimmune diseases, TLR2 expression is altered, contributing to disease pathogenesis. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), TLR2 activation is linked to angiogenesis and inflammation, although specific polymorphisms like Arg677Trp and Arg753Gln do not show a strong association with RA susceptibility (Corr2009Genetic; Liu2013TLR2). In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), increased TLR2 expression is involved in cytokine dysregulation, exacerbating disease symptoms (Liu2013TLR2).

TLR2 also plays a role in the immune response to viral infections. The R753Q polymorphism impairs TLR2's ability to recognize certain viral proteins, increasing the risk of complications in liver transplant patients with chronic hepatitis C (OliveiraNascimento2012The). These findings highlight the clinical significance of TLR2 in various infectious and autoimmune conditions.

## Interactions
TLR2 (Toll-like receptor 2) is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in the immune response. TLR2 forms heterodimers with other Toll-like receptors, such as TLR1 and TLR6, to recognize a broad range of microbial ligands. The TLR2/1 heterodimer is responsible for detecting triacylated lipopeptides, while the TLR2/6 heterodimer recognizes diacylated lipopeptides (Colleselli2023An). TLR2 can also form heterodimers with TLR4 and TLR10, expanding its ligand recognition capabilities (Francisco2022Induction; Colleselli2023An).

The TIR domain of TLR2 is essential for signaling, facilitating interactions with adaptor proteins such as MyD88 and TIRAP. These interactions are critical for downstream signaling pathways that lead to the activation of NF-κB and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Nada2012Molecular; Sampaio2018Investigation). Specific residues in the TLR2 TIR domain, such as Arg-748 and Phe-749, are crucial for its interaction with TLR1, as well as for the recruitment of adaptor proteins (Gautam2006Structural).

Additionally, TLR2 interacts with proteins like ACTR1A, which has been identified as a novel regulator of the TLR2 signaling cascade, particularly in the presence of statins (Kamal2019Crosslinking). These interactions highlight the complex network of protein interactions that TLR2 engages in to mediate immune responses.
