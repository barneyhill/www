# SEMA6C

## Overview
SEMA6C is a gene that encodes the protein semaphorin 6C, a member of the semaphorin family known for its role as a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes. Semaphorin 6C is particularly significant in the nervous system, where it functions as a guidance cue for axons, influencing neurogenesis and synapse stabilization. It achieves this by inhibiting axonal extension and promoting growth cone collapse, which is essential for the formation of neural networks (Wagner2023Semaphorin). Beyond the nervous system, semaphorin 6C is crucial in neuromuscular communication and ovarian follicle development, highlighting its diverse roles in cellular interactions and tissue-specific functions (Fard2023SEMA6C:; Wagner2023Semaphorin). The gene's expression and activity are primarily observed in the brain and skeletal muscle, underscoring its importance in maintaining neuromuscular junction stability and cellular communication.

## Structure


## Function
SEMA6C, a member of the semaphorin family, is a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the nervous system. It plays a crucial role in neurogenesis and synapse stabilization, especially in the murine brain and developing embryos. SEMA6C functions as a guiding cue for axons, inhibiting axonal extension and outgrowth in neurons through growth cone collapse, which is essential for proper neural network formation (Wagner2023Semaphorin). 

In addition to its role in the nervous system, SEMA6C is involved in neuromuscular communication. It is highly expressed at neuromuscular junctions, and its expression decreases significantly following muscle denervation, indicating its importance in maintaining synaptic connections in motoneurons (Wagner2023Semaphorin). 

SEMA6C also plays a role in ovarian follicle development by regulating cellular connections between oocytes and granulosa cells, which is critical for proper communication and follicle maturation (Wagner2023Semaphorin). 

While SEMA6C's functions in healthy human cells are not fully understood, its involvement in these processes suggests it is vital for maintaining cellular interactions and communication in specific tissues. Its expression and activity are primarily observed in the brain and skeletal muscle, contributing to neuromuscular junction stability (Fard2023SEMA6C:).

## Clinical Significance
SEMA6C has been implicated in the progression of pancreatic cancer. Downregulation of SEMA6C is associated with increased proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells through the activation of the AKT/GSK3/β-catenin/cyclin D1 signaling pathway. This downregulation correlates with poorer survival rates in patients, suggesting that SEMA6C acts as a tumor suppressor in this context (Hung2022Semaphorin). The study by Hung et al. highlights that targeting the pathway with CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as Palbociclib, could be a potential therapeutic strategy for treating pancreatic cancers with low SEMA6C expression (Hung2022Semaphorin).

SEMA6C expression is also regulated by miR-124-3p, a microRNA that suppresses its expression. High levels of miR-124-3p are linked to worse survival outcomes in pancreatic cancer patients. Inhibiting miR-124-3p can restore SEMA6C levels, thereby reducing cancer cell proliferation, which presents another potential therapeutic approach (Hung2022Semaphorin).

In addition to its role in cancer, SEMA6C is involved in neuromuscular communication and is crucial for maintaining neuromuscular junctions. Its concentration decreases following muscle denervation, indicating its importance in neuromuscular health (Wagner2023Semaphorin).

## Interactions
SEMA6C, a member of the semaphorin family, participates in several interactions with other proteins that are crucial for its role in cellular signaling. SEMA6C interacts with plexin receptors, specifically Plexin-A1, to mediate signal transduction processes that influence cellular activities such as neuromuscular communication and ovarian follicle development (Hota2012Plexin; Wagner2023Semaphorin). In the context of cancer, SEMA6C has been shown to interact with the tyrosine kinase c-Abl, leading to its phosphorylation. This interaction subsequently activates Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK), which is independent of cell-matrix adhesion, and is part of a signaling cascade that includes ERK and YAP activation, impacting cancer cell viability and growth (Fard2023SEMA6C:).

SEMA6C also forms a complex with c-Abl, which upregulates its kinase activity, leading to FAK phosphorylation. This suggests a novel SEMA6C signaling cascade in cancer cells (Fard2023SEMA6C:). These interactions highlight the role of SEMA6C in modulating key signaling pathways that are critical for both normal physiological processes and cancer progression.
