# ALDH1A2

## Overview
ALDH1A2 is a human gene that encodes the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A2, also known as RALDH2. This enzyme is a member of the aldehyde dehydrogenase family and plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of retinoic acid (RA) from retinaldehyde. RA is a critical signaling molecule involved in regulating gene expression during embryonic development and maintaining physiological homeostasis. The ALDH1A2 protein functions as a homotetramer and is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it catalyzes the irreversible conversion of retinaldehyde to RA. This enzymatic activity is essential for processes such as cardiac and renal development, as well as for modulating cellular growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. Mutations in the ALDH1A2 gene have been linked to various congenital anomalies and developmental disorders, underscoring its significance in human health (Beecroft2021Biallelic; Sládek2003Human; El2010A).

## Structure
The ALDH1A2 protein is a homotetramer composed of 55 kD monomers, with its three-dimensional structure determined and available under PDB ID: 4X2Q (Beecroft2021Biallelic). The primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, which includes specific domains such as the nucleotide-binding domain and the catalytic domain. The secondary structure features alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to the protein's stability and function (Beecroft2021Biallelic).

The tertiary structure of ALDH1A2 involves the folding of the protein into a specific three-dimensional shape, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity. This structure includes a catalytic site where key interactions occur, such as those involving Cys320, Thr321, and Asn187, which are important for inhibitor binding (Chen2017Structural). The quaternary structure is characterized by the assembly of the protein into a tetramer, which is essential for its biological function (Chen2017Structural).

ALDH1A2 also features a large flexible loop (residues 475-495) that becomes structured upon inhibitor binding, facilitating interactions with neighboring monomers in the tetramer (Chen2017Structural). The protein's structure allows it to accommodate diverse small molecules, making it a target for selective inhibitor design (Chen2017Structural).

## Function
The human gene ALDH1A2 encodes an enzyme that plays a critical role in the synthesis of retinoic acid (RA) from retinaldehyde, a process essential for normal development and physiological homeostasis. This enzyme, also known as RALDH2, is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is responsible for the irreversible conversion of retinaldehyde to RA, a key signaling molecule involved in various biological processes (Sládek2003Human; El2010A).

In healthy human cells, ALDH1A2 is crucial for embryonic development, particularly in the formation of the heart and kidneys. It is the dominant enzyme responsible for generating RA in embryonic tissues, influencing processes such as nephrogenesis and cardiac development (Pavan2009ALDH1A2; El2010A). RA produced by ALDH1A2 regulates gene expression by binding to nuclear receptors, which then modulate the transcription of genes involved in cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (Zhu2022Variants).

ALDH1A2 also plays a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing inflammation. It has been implicated in the anti-inflammatory response in chondrocytes, suggesting its involvement in protecting against inflammatory diseases like osteoarthritis (Zhu2022Variants). The enzyme's activity is essential for the proper functioning of healthy cells, and its loss or dysfunction can lead to developmental abnormalities and disease (Kim2005The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ALDH1A2 gene are associated with a range of congenital anomalies and developmental disorders. Biallelic hypomorphic variants in ALDH1A2 have been linked to a novel lethal multiple congenital anomaly syndrome characterized by diaphragmatic, pulmonary, and cardiovascular defects. This syndrome often results in neonatal lethality due to severe pulmonary hypoplasia and respiratory failure (Beecroft2021Biallelic). 

ALDH1A2 mutations are also implicated in congenital heart diseases, such as Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). Specific mutations, like p.Ala151Ser and p.Ile157Thr, affect the protein's tetramerization domain, potentially disrupting its function and contributing to the development of TOF (Pavan2009ALDH1A2). 

Alterations in ALDH1A2 expression can lead to neural tube defects (NTDs), including spina bifida. Certain polymorphisms in the gene have been associated with an increased risk of NTDs, suggesting that these genetic variations may influence the risk of such defects (Deak2005Analysis). 

The gene's role in the retinoic acid pathway is crucial for normal embryonic development, and disruptions in this pathway due to ALDH1A2 mutations can lead to significant developmental issues (Leon2022ALDH1A2‐related).
