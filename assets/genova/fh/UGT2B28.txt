# UGT2B28

## Overview
UGT2B28 is a gene that encodes the enzyme UDP glucuronosyltransferase family 2 member B28, which is part of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase family. This enzyme is primarily involved in the glucuronidation process, a critical biochemical pathway that facilitates the metabolism and excretion of steroid hormones and bile acids by conjugating them with glucuronic acid. The UGT2B28 protein is predominantly expressed in the liver, mammary gland, and prostate, where it plays a significant role in the inactivation and regulation of androgens and estrogens, thus influencing hormonal balance and responses (Lévesque2001Isolation). The enzyme is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and perinuclear membranes, where it modulates steroid hormone action by conjugating steroid molecules before they enter the nucleus (Lévesque2001Isolation). UGT2B28's activity is crucial for maintaining steroid homeostasis and detoxification processes, although it is less efficient compared to other UGT enzymes (Meech2019The). The gene's expression and function have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of prostate cancer and other hormone-sensitive conditions (Belledant2016The; Albertsen2019Whole).

## Structure
The UGT2B28 gene encodes a UDP-glucuronosyltransferase enzyme involved in steroid metabolism. The primary structure of the UGT2B28 type I protein consists of 529 amino acids, featuring an open reading frame of 1587 base pairs (Lévesque2001Isolation). This protein includes essential domains such as an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) targeting signal, a membrane anchoring region, and substrate and cofactor binding domains (Lévesque2001Isolation). The C-terminal region is highly conserved and contains the UDP-glucuronic acid (UDPGA) binding site, crucial for its enzymatic activity (Lévesque2001Isolation).

UGT2B28 has three isoforms: type I, type II, and type III. Type I is the full-length protein, while types II and III are shorter due to deletions in their nucleotide sequences. Type II lacks the UDPGA binding domain and the transmembrane region, resulting in a truncated protein of 335 amino acids. Type III, with a 351 bp deletion, retains the UDPGA binding domain and a hydrophobic transmembrane region, resulting in a 412-amino acid protein (Lévesque2001Isolation). All isoforms have a potential asparagine-linked glycosylation site, indicating post-translational modification (Lévesque2001Isolation). The role of types II and III remains unclear, but type III may form dimers with other UGT proteins (Lévesque2001Isolation).

## Function
UGT2B28 is a member of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase family, which plays a crucial role in the glucuronidation process. This enzyme is involved in the metabolism and elimination of steroid hormones and bile acids by conjugating them with glucuronic acid, making these compounds more water-soluble and facilitating their excretion from the body (Lévesque2001Isolation). UGT2B28 is primarily expressed in the liver, mammary gland, and prostate, where it contributes to the inactivation of androgens and estrogens, thus regulating their bioavailability and hormonal responses (Lévesque2001Isolation; Belledant2016The).

The enzyme is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and perinuclear membranes, where it modulates steroid hormone action by conjugating steroid molecules before they enter the nucleus (Lévesque2001Isolation). UGT2B28's activity is significant in the liver, where it works alongside other UGT enzymes to maintain steroid homeostasis and detoxification processes (Lévesque2001Isolation). Despite its lower efficiency compared to other UGTs, UGT2B28 contributes to the metabolism of androgens and other signaling molecules, highlighting its role in maintaining intracellular steroid hormone balance (Meech2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the UGT2B28 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in prostate cancer (PCa) progression. Overexpression of UGT2B28 in prostate tumors is associated with more aggressive cancer phenotypes, including smaller tumor volume, lower prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, positive nodal status, and higher Gleason scores. This overexpression is linked to increased circulating levels of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, suggesting a role in modifying hormone bioavailability and disease progression (Belledant2016The). Conversely, UGT2B28 deficiency, characterized by the absence of the gene, results in lower levels of circulating testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, with increased levels of the adrenal precursor androstenedione. This deficiency is associated with a reprogramming of the endocrine system, potentially adapting hormone bioavailability to the reduced conjugation capacity (Belledant2016The).

In addition to its role in PCa, UGT2B28 has been implicated in other conditions. Genetic deletions of UGT2B28 have been linked to Addison's disease and biochemical recurrence in PCa patients (Belledant2016The). Furthermore, UGT2B28 deletions have been identified in a family with endometriosis, suggesting a potential role in the pathogenesis of this condition (Albertsen2019Whole). These findings underscore the importance of UGT2B28 in regulating hormonal exposure and its potential impact on various hormone-sensitive diseases.

## Interactions
UGT2B28, a member of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase family, is involved in various interactions that influence its function. The enzyme is known to be expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum and perinuclear membranes, suggesting its role in modulating steroid hormone action by conjugating steroids before they enter the nucleus (Lévesque2001Isolation). UGT2B28 has been shown to interact with the androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway. Its expression is influenced by AR and its splice variant AR-v7, which bind directly to the UGT2B28 promoter, indicating a regulatory interaction that affects its expression levels in prostate cancer cells (Ravindran2022Uridine).

The study of UGT2B28 also highlights potential interactions with other proteins in the UGT2B family. Although specific protein interactions are not detailed, the conservation of a dimerization signature motif across UGT2B enzymes suggests the potential for both homo- and heterodimerization, which could influence the enzyme's activity and function (Lewis2011Homodimerization). This motif is characterized by hydrophobic surface residues and 'proline brackets', indicating a protein-protein interaction site that may facilitate the formation of catalytically active dimers (Lewis2011Homodimerization).
