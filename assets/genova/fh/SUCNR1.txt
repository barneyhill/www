# SUCNR1

## Overview
SUCNR1 is a gene that encodes the protein succinate receptor 1, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in various physiological processes. This receptor is characterized by its seven transmembrane domain structure, typical of Class A GPCRs, and is activated by succinate, an intermediate in the citric acid cycle. Succinate receptor 1 plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling pathways that regulate energy metabolism, inflammation, and blood pressure. It is expressed in multiple tissues, including adipose tissue, liver, heart, and kidney, where it influences processes such as lipolysis, hepatic stress response, cardiac output, and blood pressure regulation. Additionally, SUCNR1 is implicated in immune modulation and has been associated with several diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, and cancer, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (He2004Citric; Okovityi2015Succinate; Gilissen2016Insight; Wu2023Extracellular).

## Structure
The SUCNR1 protein, also known as succinate receptor 1, is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a canonical seven transmembrane (TM) domain structure typical of Class A GPCRs (Liu2024Structural). The receptor's primary structure includes specific amino acids crucial for its function, such as R99, R281, R252, and H103, which are important for succinate binding by neutralizing its negative charges (Gilissen2016Insight). 

The secondary structure features transmembrane helices connected by extracellular loops, with a notable β-hairpin in the second extracellular loop (ECL2) that stabilizes ligand binding (Liu2024Structural). The tertiary structure includes a central orthosteric ligand-binding pocket on the extracellular side, surrounded by TM1, TM2, TM3, and TM7, and capped by the β-hairpin of ECL2 (Liu2024Structural). 

Post-translational modifications include two N-glycosylation sites at N8 and N168, and a phosphorylation site at S326, which may be important for receptor internalization (Gilissen2016Insight). The receptor also contains conserved motifs like DRY, PIF, and NPxxY, which are common in GPCR activation (Liu2024Structural). 

SUCNR1 has two possible open-reading frames, resulting in proteins of 330 or 334 amino acids, with the 330-AA protein being more likely expressed (Gilissen2016Insight).

## Function
SUCNR1, also known as succinate receptor 1, is a G-protein-coupled receptor that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes in healthy human cells. It is activated by succinate, a key intermediate in the citric acid cycle, and is involved in cellular signaling pathways that regulate energy metabolism, inflammation, and blood pressure (He2004Citric; Gilissen2016Insight).

In adipocytes, SUCNR1 inhibits lipolysis, which may help regulate fatty acid release under conditions of energy abundance (Okovityi2015Succinate). In the liver, SUCNR1 is expressed in hepatic stellate cells and may act as an early detector of hepatic stress, contributing to tissue restoration (Okovityi2015Succinate). In the heart, SUCNR1 is involved in increasing cardiac output and myocardial hypertrophy through pathways involving ERK1/2 and calcium signaling (Okovityi2015Succinate).

SUCNR1 also plays a role in the regulation of blood pressure through the renin-angiotensin system, with its expression in various nephron segments of the kidney (Gilissen2016Insight). In the immune system, SUCNR1 is involved in modulating immune responses and inflammation, particularly through macrophage M2 polarization (Wu2023Extracellular). The receptor's activation by succinate is highly specific, indicating its precise role in cellular metabolism and stress response (Gilissen2016Insight).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SUCNR1 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In diabetic mouse models, succinate accumulation in the kidneys activates the SUCNR1 receptor, leading to increased renin release, which may contribute to diabetes-induced hypertension and diabetic nephropathy, a major complication characterized by renal damage (Gilissen2016Insight). In humans, a specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the SUCNR1 gene, rs73168929, has been associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and essential hypertension (EH) in a northern Chinese Han population. This SNP affects mRNA stability and miRNA binding, potentially influencing the renin-angiotensin system and contributing to these conditions (Du2021Associations).

SUCNR1 is also involved in cancer progression. In lung cancer, elevated SUCNR1 expression is linked to tumor progression, although it does not significantly correlate with overall survival. The receptor's activation promotes cancer metastasis by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition and macrophage polarization, which are crucial for tumor-associated macrophage behavior and cancer cell migration (Wu2020CancerDerived). These findings suggest that SUCNR1 plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of metabolic and cancer-related diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
SUCNR1, also known as succinate receptor 1, is a G-protein-coupled receptor that primarily interacts with Gi/o proteins to mediate its signaling pathways. Upon binding with its ligand succinate, SUCNR1 undergoes structural changes that facilitate the coupling with Gi proteins, as evidenced by the outward movement of transmembrane helices TM5 and TM6 and the inward movement of TM7, which are typical features of activated GPCRs (Liu2024Structural). This interaction is crucial for the receptor's role in various physiological processes, including the regulation of blood pressure and immune responses.

SUCNR1 is also involved in the activation of signaling pathways such as ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt, which are important for processes like platelet aggregation and osteoclastogenesis (Gilissen2016Insight; Guo2017Succinate). In the context of osteoclastogenesis, SUCNR1 activation by succinate leads to the stimulation of the NF-kB signaling pathway, which is essential for bone resorption activities (Guo2017Succinate). The receptor's interaction with these signaling molecules highlights its role in both metabolic and inflammatory pathways, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in related disorders.
