# INA

## Overview
The INA gene encodes the internexin neuronal intermediate filament protein alpha (α-internexin), a type IV intermediate filament protein predominantly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS). This protein is integral to the structural framework of neurons, contributing to the assembly and maintenance of the neuronal cytoskeleton. α-Internexin is involved in forming filamentous networks by self-assembling into 10-nm filaments and interacting with neurofilament triplet proteins, thereby acting as a fourth subunit in neurofilaments. It plays a crucial role in neuronal development, particularly in axonal outgrowth and neurite elongation, and maintains structural integrity in mature neurons. The protein's interactions with other cytoskeletal components and its involvement in neurofilament assembly underscore its importance in neuronal function and stability (Zhao2016αInternexin; Yuan2006αInternexin).

## Structure
The INA gene encodes the protein α-internexin, a type IV intermediate filament protein primarily found in neurons. The primary structure of α-internexin consists of a central alpha-helical rod domain flanked by non-helical head and tail domains, which is characteristic of intermediate filament proteins (Szeverenyi2008The). The secondary structure is enriched with alpha-helices, facilitating the formation of coiled-coil dimers (Steinert1999Molecular). These dimers are capable of forming both homodimers and heterodimers, particularly with type III intermediate filament protein vimentin, contributing to the protein's tertiary structure (Steinert1999Molecular).

In terms of quaternary structure, α-internexin assembles into higher-order filamentous networks. It can coassemble with neurofilament triplet proteins (NF-L, NF-M, and NF-H) into a single filamentous network, acting as a fourth subunit in neurofilaments (Yuan2006αInternexin). This coassembly is facilitated by the similar molecular packing and alignment parameters shared with other intermediate filament proteins, allowing for promiscuous co-assembly (Steinert1999Molecular). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence the dynamics and stability of these filament structures, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context (Szeverenyi2008The).

## Function
The INA gene encodes α-internexin, a neuronal intermediate filament protein that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity and function of neurons. α-Internexin is a type IV intermediate filament protein that is primarily expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) and is involved in the assembly of the neuronal cytoskeleton. It participates in forming a filamentous network by self-assembling into 10-nm filaments and can form heteropolymers with neurofilament triplet proteins (NF-L, NF-M, and NF-H), acting as a fourth subunit of neurofilaments in the mature CNS (Zhao2016αInternexin; Yuan2006αInternexin).

In developing neurons, α-internexin is expressed earlier than neurofilament proteins and is essential for axonal outgrowth and neurite elongation. It supports the elongation of axonal neurites by facilitating the accumulation of acetylated microtubules, which are crucial for axonal stability (Shea1999Neuronal; Zhao2016αInternexin). Despite its significant roles, α-internexin knockout mice exhibit normal nervous system development, suggesting compensatory mechanisms by other proteins (Zhao2016αInternexin). In the adult CNS, α-internexin maintains a stable stoichiometry with neurofilament proteins, contributing to the structural integrity and transport functions of neurofilaments (Yuan2006αInternexin).

## Clinical Significance
The INA gene, encoding the internexin neuronal intermediate filament protein alpha, has clinical significance in the context of gliomas and neurodegenerative diseases. In gliomas, INA expression is considered a potential biomarker for prognosis. It is differentially expressed across various glioma grades, with strong expression in oligodendroglioma (grade II) and weak expression in oligoastrocytoma (grade III). Glioblastoma (grade IV) typically shows no INA expression. The presence of INA expression, along with the 1p19q deletion, is associated with longer progression-free and overall survival in anaplastic glioma (grade III) compared to glioblastoma, suggesting its role as a prognostic factor in oligodendroglioma (LépinouxChambaud2013Review).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, intermediate filaments, including those encoded by the INA gene, are implicated in conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Alterations in intermediate filaments, such as abnormal accumulation and impaired axonal transport, are common in these diseases. Although the INA gene itself is not specifically mentioned in relation to these conditions, the role of intermediate filaments in maintaining neuronal integrity suggests potential involvement in neurodegenerative processes (LépinouxChambaud2013Review).

## Interactions
Internexin neuronal intermediate filament protein alpha (INA) is known to interact with several other neuronal intermediate filament proteins, forming both homodimers and heterodimers. It can form heterodimers with neurofilament proteins such as NF-L, NF-M, and NF-H, as well as with peripherin. These interactions are significant for the assembly of intermediate filament proteins in neuronal cells, contributing to cytoskeletal reorganization during development and axonal regeneration (Athlan1997Heterodimeric).

INA also coassembles with the neurofilament triplet proteins into a single filamentous network, functioning as a fourth subunit in neurofilaments. This coassembly is crucial for the transport and structural integrity of neurofilaments in the central nervous system (Yuan2006αInternexin). The stoichiometry of these proteins in axonal neurofilaments is maintained at a molar ratio of 4:2:2:1 (NF-L:α-internexin:NF-M:NF-H) (Yuan2006αInternexin).

INA also interacts with other proteins such as myosin Va, microtubule-associated proteins, and the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor, suggesting its role in integrating diverse macromolecules into functional units. It binds selectively to membrane cytoskeletal protein 4.1R and other scaffold proteins of the postsynaptic density, indicating its potential role in facilitating the integration of neurofilaments with membrane-associated cytoskeletal and receptor components (Yuan2006αInternexin).
