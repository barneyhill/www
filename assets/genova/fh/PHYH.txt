# PHYH

## Overview
The PHYH gene encodes the enzyme phytanoyl-CoA 2-hydroxylase, a member of the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenase superfamily, which plays a crucial role in the α-oxidation of phytanic acid. This enzyme is essential for the conversion of phytanic acid to pristanic acid, a process that occurs in peroxisomes and is vital for lipid metabolism. Phytanoyl-CoA 2-hydroxylase requires Fe(II) as a cofactor and 2-oxoglutarate as a co-substrate to function effectively (Mukherji2001Structurefunction; McDonough2005Structure). Mutations in the PHYH gene can lead to Refsum's disease, characterized by the accumulation of phytanic acid, resulting in various clinical symptoms (Jansen2000Human). The enzyme's interactions with proteins such as FKBP52 and PAHX-AP a1 suggest its involvement in broader cellular processes beyond its metabolic role (Lee2000Identification; Chambraud1999Immunophilins).

## Structure
The PHYH gene encodes the enzyme phytanoyl-CoA 2-hydroxylase, which is involved in the α-oxidation of phytanic acid. The enzyme is a member of the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenase superfamily and requires Fe(II) as a cofactor and 2-oxoglutarate as a co-substrate (Mukherji2001Structurefunction; McDonough2005Structure). The primary structure of PHYH includes conserved motifs such as the HXD motif, which is crucial for iron binding, located at positions 175-177 (Jansen2004Molecular).

The secondary structure of PHYH features a double-stranded β-helix (DSBH) core, also known as a jelly-roll motif, which is common among 2OG oxygenases. This core supports the iron-binding ligands His 175, Asp 177, and His 264 (McDonough2005Structure; Schofield2007Structural). The tertiary structure of PHYH reveals a mixed α-β fold with a major and a minor β-sheet surrounded by α-helices and 3_10 helices (McDonough2005Structure).

The enzyme is initially synthesized as a proprotein with a peroxisomal targeting signal, which is cleaved to produce the mature form (Schofield2007Structural). Mutations in the PHYH gene often cluster around the Fe(II) and 2OG binding sites, affecting the enzyme's catalytic activity and leading to Refsum disease (McDonough2005Structure).

## Function
The PHYH gene encodes the enzyme phytanoyl-CoA 2-hydroxylase, which is crucial for the alpha-oxidation of phytanic acid, a branched-chain fatty acid. This enzyme catalyzes the hydroxylation of phytanoyl-CoA to 2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA, a key step in the conversion of phytanic acid to pristanic acid, which can then be further metabolized by beta-oxidation (Jansen2004Molecular; van2006Phytanic). The enzyme is located in peroxisomes, cellular organelles involved in various metabolic functions, and is targeted there via a peroxisome targeting sequence (PTS2) recognized by the PTS2-receptor (Pex7p) (Jansen2004Molecular; Wanders2003Phytanic).

Phytanoyl-CoA 2-hydroxylase belongs to the super-family of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases, requiring iron(II) as a cofactor, and dioxygen and 2-oxoglutarate as cosubstrates (Jansen2004Molecular). Its activity is essential for preventing the accumulation of phytanic acid, which can lead to disorders such as Refsum disease when deficient (Jansen2004Molecular; Wanders2003Phytanic). The enzyme's function is critical for maintaining normal metabolic processes in healthy human cells, highlighting its role in lipid metabolism and peroxisomal function (Wierzbicki2007Peroxisomal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PHYH gene, which encodes the enzyme phytanoyl-CoA 2-hydroxylase, are linked to Refsum's disease, a rare autosomal recessive disorder. This condition is characterized by the accumulation of phytanic acid in plasma and tissues, leading to symptoms such as retinitis pigmentosa, anosmia, sensory neuropathy, and cerebellar ataxia (Jansen2000Human; Mukherji2001Structurefunction). The disease results from deficient activity of the enzyme due to various mutations, including missense mutations, deletions, and splice site mutations, which lead to inactive or unstable enzyme forms (Jansen2000Human).

Specific mutations, such as the in-frame 111 bp deletion and missense mutations like c.823C→T and c.610G→A, have been shown to cause complete inactivation of the enzyme (Jansen2000Human). The c.530A→G mutation results in complete inactivation, while c.734G→A causes partial deficiency (Jansen2000Human). The PHYH:c.678+5G>T variant is associated with a milder form of Refsum's disease, causing in-frame exon skipping (Daich2024PHYH).

Refsum's disease is distinct from other peroxisomal disorders, such as Zellweger syndrome, due to its specific genetic and clinical profile (Wierzbicki2002Refsum’s). Treatment typically involves dietary restrictions and procedures to reduce phytanic acid levels, which can alleviate some symptoms (Wierzbicki2002Refsum’s).

## Interactions
Phytanoyl-CoA 2-hydroxylase (PHYH) is known to interact with several proteins, indicating its involvement in various cellular processes. One significant interaction is with FKBP52, a member of the FK506-binding protein family. This interaction is specific, as PHYH does not bind to FKBP12, another member of the same family. The association between PHYH and FKBP52 is maintained even in the presence of the immunosuppressant FK506, suggesting a potential role in cellular signaling pathways related to immunosuppressant drugs (Chambraud1999Immunophilins).

PHYH also interacts with a brain-specific protein known as PAHX-AP a1, which is associated with brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1 (BAI1). This interaction may be involved in brain-specific signal transduction pathways, potentially contributing to the neurological symptoms observed in Refsum disease (Lee2000Identification).

Additionally, PHYH has been identified in interactions with human coagulation factor VIII, suggesting a possible role in clotting factor regulation (Jansen2004Molecular). These interactions highlight the diverse functional roles PHYH may play beyond its enzymatic activity in phytanic acid metabolism.
