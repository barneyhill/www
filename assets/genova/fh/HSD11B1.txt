# HSD11B1

## Overview
The HSD11B1 gene encodes the enzyme hydroxysteroid 11-beta dehydrogenase 1 (11β-HSD1), a crucial component in the regulation of glucocorticoid metabolism. This enzyme, categorized as an oxidoreductase, is primarily involved in the conversion of inactive cortisone to active cortisol, thereby modulating local glucocorticoid levels in various tissues, including the liver, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle (Kragl2022Effects; Lavery2012Lack). The activity of 11β-HSD1 is essential for maintaining energy homeostasis and influencing metabolic processes, immune responses, and stress adaptation (Gray2017Getting). Dysregulation of HSD11B1 expression or function has been implicated in several clinical conditions, such as cortisone reductase deficiency, metabolic syndrome, and certain cancers, highlighting its significance as a potential therapeutic target (Li2018Hydroxysteroid; Draper2003Mutations).

## Structure
The HSD11B1 gene encodes the enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1), a 34-kDa glycoprotein composed of 292 amino acids (Draper200511βHydroxysteroid; GomezSanchez202111βhydroxysteroid). The primary structure of 11β-HSD1 includes a sequence of amino acids that form the polypeptide chain, with significant homology to other species, such as 77% identity with the rat enzyme (Tannin1991The; Draper200511βHydroxysteroid).

The secondary structure of 11β-HSD1 features a Rossmann fold, a motif common for NADP(H) binding, consisting of alternating α-helices and β-strands (GomezSanchez202111βhydroxysteroid). The enzyme's tertiary structure is characterized by its orientation within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, with the catalytic domain located in the ER lumen (Draper200511βHydroxysteroid; GomezSanchez202111βhydroxysteroid).

In terms of quaternary structure, 11β-HSD1 can form homodimers, which significantly enhance its enzymatic efficiency by lowering its Km (GomezSanchez202111βhydroxysteroid). Glycosylation, although not essential for activity, is thought to stabilize the protein and prevent aggregation within the ER (Draper200511βHydroxysteroid). The enzyme also contains a GxxxGxG motif and a catalytic triad of Ser, Tyr, and Lys residues crucial for its activity (GomezSanchez202111βhydroxysteroid).

## Function
The HSD11B1 gene encodes the enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1), which is crucial for the conversion of inactive cortisone to active cortisol in various tissues. This enzyme is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum and plays a significant role in regulating local glucocorticoid levels, impacting metabolic processes, immune response, and stress adaptation (Kragl2022Effects; Lavery2012Lack).

In healthy human cells, 11β-HSD1 is involved in the regeneration of glucocorticoids, which are essential for activating glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors. This activity is particularly important in tissues such as the liver, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and bone, where it influences energy homeostasis and tissue-specific glucocorticoid effects (Kragl2022Effects; Gray2017Getting). In the liver and adipose tissue, 11β-HSD1 contributes to metabolic regulation by modulating local cortisol levels, which can affect insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism (Lavery2012Lack).

The enzyme's activity is also linked to bone tissue homeostasis, where it provides the necessary glucocorticoid stimulus for osteoblast differentiation, thus playing a role in bone health and potentially influencing the development of osteoporosis (Kragl2022Effects).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the HSD11B1 gene have significant clinical implications. In gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), HSD11B1 overexpression and copy-number gain (CNG) are associated with aggressive tumor behavior and poor prognosis. High HSD11B1 expression is linked to larger tumor size, higher mitotic rate, and unfavorable mutations in KIT/PDGFRA/BRAF, contributing to shorter disease-free survival (DFS) in patients (Li2018Hydroxysteroid). The gene's overexpression is particularly prevalent in high-risk and metastatic GISTs, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for identifying high-risk cases (Li2018Hydroxysteroid).

In the context of metabolic disorders, mutations in HSD11B1 can lead to cortisone reductase deficiency (CRD), characterized by impaired conversion of cortisone to cortisol, resulting in androgen excess and symptoms similar to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (Draper2003Mutations). The interaction between HSD11B1 and hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PD) mutations is crucial for CRD manifestation, highlighting a digenic triallelic mode of inheritance (Draper2003Mutations). Additionally, increased HSD11B1 expression is associated with obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and it is considered a target for drug development in treating metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes (White2018Alterations).

## Interactions
HSD11B1, or hydroxysteroid 11-beta dehydrogenase 1, is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the conversion of inactive cortisone to active cortisol, impacting glucocorticoid receptor activation in various tissues such as liver, lung, and adipose tissue (Staab201011β-Hydroxysteroid). This enzyme is primarily an NADPH-dependent reductase, and its activity is influenced by the availability of NADPH, which is regenerated by hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PD) in the endoplasmic reticulum (Draper2003Mutations). 

HSD11B1 interacts with H6PD, which is crucial for its oxoreductase activity. This interaction is significant in the context of cortisone reductase deficiency (CRD), where mutations in both HSD11B1 and H6PD contribute to the disease phenotype (Draper2003Mutations). The enzyme's activity is also modulated by various cytokines and metabolic regulators, including inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α and IL-1β, which can upregulate HSD11B1 expression in a tissue-specific manner (Staab201011β-Hydroxysteroid). 

HSD11B1 is involved in broader metabolic and inflammatory pathways, influencing the expression of genes related to metabolism and inflammation through its role in glucocorticoid metabolism (Staab201011β-Hydroxysteroid).
