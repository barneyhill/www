# SH2B3

## Overview
The SH2B3 gene encodes the SH2B adaptor protein 3, commonly referred to as LNK, which is a member of the SH2B family of adaptor proteins. This protein is characterized by its distinct domain architecture, including an N-terminal dimerization domain, a central pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and a C-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, which facilitate its role in cellular signaling pathways (Devallière2011The; Morris2021The). LNK functions primarily as a negative regulator of cytokine signaling, particularly within the JAK-STAT pathway, and is involved in the regulation of hematopoietic stem cell proliferation and endothelial cell adhesion (Morris2021The; Devallière2012LNK). Mutations in SH2B3 have been implicated in various hematological and autoimmune disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Devallière2011The; Arfeuille2023Germline).

## Structure
The SH2B3 protein, also known as LNK, is a member of the SH2B family of adaptor proteins and is characterized by its distinct domain architecture. It comprises an N-terminal dimerization domain, a central pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and a C-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domain (Devallière2011The; Morris2021The). The dimerization domain, approximately 60 residues long, facilitates protein-protein interactions and allows for homo- or heterodimerization among SH2B family members, although LNK homodimerization has been demonstrated only in artificial models (Morris2021The). The PH domain, about 120 residues, is crucial for protein localization and interacts with phosphatidylinositol lipids in the cell membrane (Devallière2011The; Morris2021The). The SH2 domain, around 100 residues, is responsible for recognizing and binding target proteins, playing a critical role in LNK's function (Morris2021The; Sinclair2019SH2B3).

The SH2 domain of LNK adopts a canonical fold with three central beta strands flanked by alpha helices, and includes a short helix on the N-terminal boundary (Morris2021Structural). This domain is monomeric, unlike APS, which forms a dimer via its α-B helix (Morris2021The). The SH2 domain's phosphotyrosine binding pocket is homologous to that of SH2B1, with specific residues downstream of the phosphotyrosine conferring specificity (Morris2021Structural; Sinclair2019SH2B3). The PH and dimerization domains of LNK resemble those of APS, but large linker regions between domains are predicted to be unstructured (Morris2021The). SH2B3 is subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which can affect its interactions and function (Morris2021The).

## Function
The SH2B3 gene encodes the adaptor protein LNK, which plays a crucial role in regulating various signaling pathways in healthy human cells. LNK functions primarily as a negative regulator of cytokine signaling, particularly within the JAK-STAT pathway, which is essential for controlling cell proliferation and inflammation. By binding to phosphotyrosine residues on signaling proteins, LNK constrains the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, thereby preventing excessive proliferative and inflammatory responses (Morris2021The; Niemeyer2024&lt; i&gt; SH2B3&lt).

In hematopoietic cells, LNK is highly expressed and regulates the self-renewal and proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) by inhibiting thrombopoietin (TPO) and erythropoietin signaling pathways. It achieves this by interacting directly with JAK2, a tyrosine kinase, and modulating its activity to control downstream activation of STAT5, which is crucial for normal blood cell development (Morris2021The; Niemeyer2024&lt; i&gt; SH2B3&lt).

LNK also plays a significant role in endothelial cells by regulating integrin-mediated signaling pathways, which are vital for cell adhesion and migration. It interacts with integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and targets α-parvin, affecting focal adhesion dynamics and stabilizing cell attachment to the extracellular matrix (Devallière2012LNK).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SH2B3 gene, also known as LNK, have been implicated in various hematological and autoimmune disorders. Bi-allelic germline loss-of-function mutations in SH2B3 are associated with a juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML)-like disorder, characterized by increased JAK/STAT signaling and expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. This condition often resolves spontaneously and is linked to a hypomethylated DNA pattern, suggesting a favorable prognosis (Arfeuille2023Germline). SH2B3 mutations are also found in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), with a prevalence of 5 to 7% in MPN patients, increasing to 13% in cases of leukemic transformation. These mutations often coexist with other driver mutations, such as JAK2, MPL, and CALR, contributing to the MPN phenotype (Maslah2017The).

In the context of autoimmune diseases, SH2B3 has been linked to type 1 diabetes, coeliac disease, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and multiple sclerosis. The SNP rs3184504 in SH2B3 is associated with these conditions, affecting T-cell proliferation and immune response (Devallière2011The). Additionally, SH2B3 mutations are involved in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), particularly in cases with intrachromosomal amplification of chromosome 21, where they are associated with poor prognosis (Sinclair2019SH2B3).

## Interactions
SH2B3, also known as LNK, is an adaptor protein that participates in various protein interactions, playing a crucial role in signaling pathways. It interacts with JAK2 and SHP2, inhibiting the JAK2/STAT3 and SHP2/Grb2/PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, which are important for cancer cell survival and metastasis (Wang2022TGFβ1SH2B3). In hematopoietic cells, SH2B3 binds to phosphorylated tyrosine residues on JAK2 or JAK3, acting as a negative regulator of cytokine signaling (Arfeuille2023Germline). 

SH2B3 also interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, which bind to phosphoserine residues on SH2B3, preventing its binding to JAK2 and thereby increasing JAK2 activity and downstream STAT5 activation (Morris2021The). It can bind to both wild-type and mutant forms of JAK2, such as the JAK2 V617F mutation, and modulates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway in myeloproliferative neoplasms (Maslah2017The). 

In endothelial cells, SH2B3 regulates integrin signaling by forming a complex with integrin-linked kinase (ILK), inhibiting the ILK-α-parvin interaction, which affects cell adhesion and migration (Devallière2012LNK). These interactions highlight SH2B3's role as a key regulator in various cellular processes.
