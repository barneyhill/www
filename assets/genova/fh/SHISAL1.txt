# SHISAL1

## Overview
SHISAL1 (shisa like 1) is a gene that encodes the SHISAL1 protein, which plays a significant role in cellular signaling pathways, particularly in modulating Wnt and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling. These pathways are essential for various biological processes, including cell differentiation, embryogenesis, and tissue homeostasis. The SHISAL1 protein is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, where it is involved in protein maturation and trafficking, indicating its role in regulating protein processing and cellular signaling (Sharma2024Genomewide). The gene has been associated with several physiological and pathological conditions, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), highlighting its potential importance in metabolic and developmental processes (Liu2019Key; Sharma2024Genomewide). Despite its associations, the precise mechanisms and clinical implications of SHISAL1 remain subjects of ongoing research.

## Function
SHISAL1 (shisa like 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cellular signaling pathways, particularly modulating Wnt and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling. These pathways are crucial for cell differentiation and development, impacting processes such as embryogenesis and tissue homeostasis. The SHISAL1 protein is typically active in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, where it influences protein maturation and trafficking. This localization suggests a role in the regulation of protein processing and cellular signaling (Sharma2024Genomewide).

In the context of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), SHISAL1 has been identified as significantly associated with the development risk of the condition. Functional analysis using in silico tools indicates that SHISAL1 is involved in cellular responses to fibroblast growth factor and cell proliferation, suggesting its role in cellular growth and development processes (Sharma2024Genomewide). Additionally, SHISAL1 is upregulated in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), although specific molecular processes or cell biology roles in this context are not detailed (Liu2019Key). These findings highlight the potential importance of SHISAL1 in various physiological and pathological processes.

## Clinical Significance
The SHISAL1 gene has been implicated in several conditions through alterations in its expression levels, although specific diseases directly resulting from mutations in SHISAL1 are not well-documented. In German Holstein cows, SHISAL1 has been identified as a potential candidate gene associated with ketosis, a condition related to lipid metabolism and fatty liver disease (Klein2019Phenotypic). This suggests a possible role in metabolic processes, although the exact mechanisms remain unclear.

In humans, SHISAL1 is noted for its upregulation in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), indicating a potential involvement in the disease's pathophysiology (Liu2019Key). However, the specific impact of SHISAL1 expression changes in T2DM is not detailed, and further research is needed to elucidate its role.

Additionally, SHISAL1 shows significant differential expression in human dental pulp stem cells from molars, although the clinical implications of this finding are not specified (Faruangsaeng2022Comparative). Overall, while SHISAL1 is associated with various conditions through expression alterations, its precise clinical significance and the consequences of its mutations require further investigation.
