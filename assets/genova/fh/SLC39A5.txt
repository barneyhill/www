# SLC39A5

## Overview
SLC39A5 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 39 member 5, which is a zinc transporter belonging to the ZIP (Zrt/Irt-like Protein) family. This transmembrane protein plays a pivotal role in zinc homeostasis by facilitating the uptake of zinc into cells, which is crucial for numerous cellular processes, including enzyme function and insulin secretion (Chim2021Genetic). SLC39A5 is primarily located on the cell surface, where it regulates zinc efflux, particularly in the gut, to maintain systemic zinc balance (Chim2021Genetic). The protein's interactions with other members of the SLC39A family and its regulation through microRNAs underscore its complex role in cellular zinc management (Weaver2011Regulation; Qu2021PanCancer). Variations in the SLC39A5 gene have been associated with several health conditions, including metabolic disorders, lung adenocarcinoma, and high myopia, highlighting its clinical significance (Feng2017Mutational; Chim2021Genetic; Liu2021SLC39A5).

## Function
The SLC39A5 gene encodes a zinc transporter protein that is part of the solute carrier family 39 (ZIP), which facilitates zinc uptake into cells. This protein plays a crucial role in maintaining zinc homeostasis, which is essential for various cellular functions, including enzyme activity and insulin secretion (Chim2021Genetic). In healthy human cells, SLC39A5 is involved in regulating zinc levels within cells, ensuring proper zinc balance to support metabolic processes and prevent metabolic disorders (Chim2021Genetic).

SLC39A5 is primarily active on the cell surface, where it facilitates the efflux of excess zinc into the gut lumen, thus maintaining systemic zinc homeostasis (Chim2021Genetic). The protein's activity is crucial for the regulation of zinc levels in the body, as evidenced by the association of loss-of-function variants in SLC39A5 with elevated serum zinc levels (Chim2021Genetic). In the context of pancreatic β-cells, SLC39A5 is involved in glucose sensing and insulin secretion, primarily through the regulation of glucose transporter 2 (Glut2) expression and pathways mediated by sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) (Wang2018The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SLC39A5 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In the context of metabolic health, loss-of-function (LOF) variants in SLC39A5 are associated with increased circulating zinc levels and a nominal reduction in the risk of type II diabetes (T2D). These variants may offer protective effects against non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) by improving liver function and reducing hyperglycemia in obesogenic settings (Chim2021Genetic).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), SLC39A5 is significantly upregulated, and its overexpression correlates with poorer overall survival and disease-free survival. It promotes LUAD cell proliferation and tumorigenesis by modulating cell cycle progression and apoptosis, primarily through the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (Liu2021SLC39A5).

SLC39A5 mutations have also been implicated in high myopia. Several heterozygous mutations, such as p.Pro287Leu, p.Arg319Thr, and p.Arg84Trp, have been identified in patients with high myopia, suggesting a potential role in the development of this condition (Feng2017Mutational; Jiang2014Detection). These mutations may affect zinc transport and homeostasis, contributing to the pathogenesis of high myopia (Liu2020Mutation).

## Interactions
The SLC39A5 gene, part of the solute carrier family 39, is involved in zinc transport and has been shown to participate in various protein interactions. Physical interactions have been identified between SLC39A5 and other members of the SLC39A family, such as SLC39A10 and SLC39A6, indicating its role in forming complexes that may be crucial for its function in zinc ion transport and homeostasis (Qu2021PanCancer). These interactions suggest that SLC39A5 may work in concert with other zinc transporters to regulate cellular zinc levels effectively.

In addition to protein interactions, the regulation of SLC39A5 involves interactions with nucleic acids, particularly through its 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR). This region is highly conserved and contains specific structural features that allow it to bind with polysome-associated proteins, which may play a role in the regulation of SLC39A5 translation. The 3′-UTR also interacts with microRNAs, such as miR-328 and miR-193a-3p, which target this region and potentially influence the gene's expression in response to zinc availability (Weaver2011Regulation). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms governing SLC39A5 function.
