# NAP1L3

## Overview
NAP1L3, or nucleosome assembly protein 1 like 3, is a gene that encodes a histone chaperone protein involved in chromatin assembly and remodeling. This protein plays a pivotal role in maintaining chromatin structure and regulating gene expression, particularly in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) where it is highly expressed. NAP1L3 is characterized by a conserved NAP domain, which is essential for its function in histone binding and nucleosome assembly, and an acidic C-terminal domain that may influence histone interactions. The protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and transcriptional programs necessary for cell proliferation and differentiation. NAP1L3's activity is crucial for the balance between self-renewal and differentiation of HSCs, impacting cellular proliferation and lineage regeneration. Additionally, NAP1L3 has been associated with oncological conditions, such as acute myeloid leukemia and hepatocellular carcinoma, where its expression is modulated by specific regulatory pathways, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Heshmati2018The; Lv2021CircRNA).

## Structure
NAP1L3 is a member of the nucleosome assembly protein family, characterized by a conserved NAP domain essential for histone binding and nucleosome assembly. This domain exhibits a dome-shaped architecture with a dimerization helix and an alpha-beta domain in each monomer, facilitating its role as a histone chaperone (Park2006Structure). The NAP domain is crucial for the protein's function in chromatin assembly and disassembly, as well as transcription regulation (Park2006Structure).

NAP1L3 contains an acidic C-terminal domain, which is mostly unstructured and may contribute to histone binding. This domain is conserved in composition but varies in length across species, potentially influencing its interaction with histones (Park2006Structure). The accessory domain of NAP1L3, which includes PKE*P**K*EE repeats, is hypothesized to regulate nuclear localization by masking the nuclear export sequence (NES), thus determining functional specificity (Park2006Structure).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may regulate NAP1L3's function and interactions, particularly in its role in nuclear shuttling and cell-cycle regulation (Park2006Structure). However, specific details on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of NAP1L3 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
NAP1L3 (nucleosome assembly protein 1 like 3) is a histone chaperone that plays a critical role in chromatin assembly and remodeling, which are essential for maintaining chromatin structure and regulating gene expression in healthy human cells. It is highly expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and is crucial for their maintenance and differentiation. NAP1L3 regulates transcriptional programs necessary for cell cycle progression, including pathways involving E2F targets, G2/M checkpoint, and MYC targets, indicating its involvement in cell cycle regulation (Heshmati2018The).

In the nucleus, NAP1L3 interacts with histones to facilitate the assembly of nucleosomes, the fundamental units of chromatin, thereby influencing DNA packaging and gene expression. This protein is involved in establishing a chromatin landscape that is essential for the function of HSCs and is propagated to more mature hematopoietic cells through epigenetic mechanisms (Heshmati2018The). NAP1L3's activity is crucial for maintaining the balance between self-renewal and differentiation of HSCs, impacting cellular proliferation and lineage regeneration (Heshmati2018The). Despite its significant role in HSC function, NAP1L3 has not been associated with clinical outcomes in hematological malignancies (Heshmati2018The).

## Clinical Significance
NAP1L3 has been implicated in several hematological and oncological conditions due to its role in chromatin assembly and regulation. In hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), NAP1L3 is crucial for maintaining cell cycle progression and differentiation. Its overexpression has been observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), suggesting a potential role in leukemogenesis. This overexpression is associated with pathways involving HOXA genes, MYC, and E2F targets, which are critical for cell cycle regulation and differentiation, indicating that NAP1L3 may contribute to the transformation or maintenance of AML cells (Heshmati2018The).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), NAP1L3 expression is modulated by circRNA GFRA1, which acts as a sponge for miR-498, leading to increased NAP1L3 levels. This interaction promotes HCC progression, as NAP1L3 is involved in cell viability and pre-mRNA splicing. The circGFRA1/miR-498/NAP1L3 axis has been identified as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in HCC, highlighting the clinical significance of NAP1L3 in cancer progression (Lv2021CircRNA). These findings underscore the importance of NAP1L3 in both hematological and solid tumor contexts, suggesting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target.

## Interactions
NAP1L3, a histone chaperone, is involved in chromatin assembly and transcriptional regulation. It interacts with mitotic cyclins and has been shown to augment p300/CBP gene transcription of E2F1 and p53, which are crucial for cell cycle progression and apoptosis (Heshmati2018The). NAP1L3 is also implicated in the transcriptional regulation of genes necessary for cell cycle progression, including MYC and E2F targets (Heshmati2018The). 

In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), NAP1L3 expression is regulated by circGFRA1, which acts as a molecular sponge for miR-498. This interaction reduces miR-498 levels, leading to increased NAP1L3 expression. The miR-498 directly targets NAP1L3, and its overexpression decreases NAP1L3 mRNA and protein levels, an effect reversed by circGFRA1 (Lv2021CircRNA). This regulatory pathway highlights the role of NAP1L3 in HCC progression through the miR-498/NAP1L3 axis (Lv2021CircRNA).

NAP1L3's involvement in chromatin dynamics suggests potential interactions with other chromatin-associated proteins, influencing transcription regulation and chromatin remodeling processes, although specific protein interactions are not detailed in the provided context.
