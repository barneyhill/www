# WSB2

## Overview
The WSB2 gene encodes the protein WD repeat and SOCS box containing 2, which is a crucial component of the cellular machinery involved in protein degradation and signal transduction. This protein is characterized by the presence of WD40 repeats and a SOCS box, which facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions and ubiquitination pathways. As part of the CRL5 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, WSB2 is involved in the ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation of target proteins, such as the pro-apoptotic protein NOXA, thereby playing a significant role in regulating apoptosis and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Jiao2024Disruption). Additionally, WSB2 interacts with various receptors, including the interleukin-21 receptor (IL-21R), modulating immune responses and influencing cell signaling pathways (Nara2010Regulation). The dysregulation of WSB2 expression has been implicated in several cancers, where it is associated with tumor progression and poor clinical outcomes, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2019WD; Ma2020miR‑28‑5p).

## Structure
WSB2 is a protein characterized by the presence of WD40 repeats and a SOCS box, which are crucial for its function in protein-protein interactions and ubiquitination pathways. The WD40 repeats are typically involved in facilitating protein-protein interactions, while the SOCS box, which includes the BC box and the Cullin 5 (CUL5) box, is essential for interaction with Elongin B/C and CUL5, forming part of the CRL5 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (Jiao2024Disruption). This complex is responsible for the ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation of target proteins such as NOXA (Jiao2024Disruption).

WSB2 is detected as two bands of approximately 47 and 40 kDa, with the lower band possibly representing a cleaved or degraded form (Nara2010Regulation). The protein's structure allows it to interact with various proteins, including the interleukin-21 receptor (IL-21R) and BCL-2 family proteins, indicating its role in signal transduction and apoptosis regulation (Jiao2024Disruption; Nara2010Regulation). The SOCS box is particularly critical for its function in NOXA degradation, as mutations in this domain impair its ability to decrease NOXA protein levels (Jiao2024Disruption).

## Function
WSB2 is involved in several molecular processes crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis. It functions as part of the CRL5 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, where it mediates the ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation of the pro-apoptotic protein NOXA. This activity is essential for regulating apoptosis, as WSB2 helps maintain low levels of NOXA, preventing spontaneous apoptosis in healthy cells (Jiao2024Disruption). WSB2's role in apoptosis regulation is further supported by its interactions with BCL-2 family proteins on the outer mitochondrial membrane, suggesting its involvement in mitochondrial apoptosis pathways (Jiao2024Disruption).

WSB2 also negatively regulates the expression and signal transduction of the interleukin-21 receptor (IL-21R). It interacts with the membrane-proximal intracellular region of IL-21R, reducing IL-21R expression and IL-21-induced signal transduction, which is significant for modulating immune responses (Nara2010Regulation). Additionally, WSB2 regulates the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSF-R), influencing its cell surface expression and signaling, which is crucial for neutrophil development and myeloid cell proliferation (Erkeland2006Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the WSB2 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In melanoma, WSB2 is highly expressed and associated with clinicopathological characteristics. Knockdown of WSB2 in melanoma cells inhibits cell viability, migration, and cell cycle progression, suggesting its role in promoting tumor growth and progression (Zhang2019WD). In breast cancer, WSB2 is upregulated in tumor tissues and linked to poor survival outcomes. It promotes cell migration, and its expression is negatively regulated by miR-28-5p, which binds to the 3'UTR of WSB2 mRNA (Ma2020miR‑28‑5p).

WSB2 is also overexpressed in other cancer types, such as prostate adenocarcinoma and liver hepatocellular carcinoma, where it correlates with clinical parameters like Gleason score and pathological stage. High WSB2 expression is associated with shorter overall survival in liver cancer (Jiao2024Disruption). WSB2's role in cancer involves modulating apoptosis through its interaction with the CRL5 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which degrades the pro-apoptotic protein NOXA. Disruption of this interaction can lead to synthetic lethality when combined with inhibitors of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins, highlighting WSB2 as a potential therapeutic target (Jiao2024Disruption).

## Interactions
WSB2 interacts with various proteins, primarily through its role in the CRL5 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. It is involved in the degradation of NOXA, a pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family protein, by mediating its ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation. This interaction is crucial for regulating apoptosis, as the disruption of WSB2 leads to NOXA accumulation, sensitizing cells to apoptosis when anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins are inhibited (Jiao2024Disruption). WSB2 interacts with multiple BCL-2 family proteins, including MCL-1, BCL-2, BCL-XL, and BAD, although it does not alter their turnover (Jiao2024Disruption).

WSB2 also interacts with the interleukin-21 receptor (IL-21R), specifically binding to the membrane-proximal intracellular region of IL-21R, which includes the box1 and box2 regions. This interaction leads to decreased IL-21R protein levels and attenuates IL-21-induced signal transduction by reducing IL-21R expression levels in lymphoid cells (Nara2010Regulation).

In breast cancer, WSB2 is targeted by miR-28-5p, which inhibits WSB2 expression by binding to its 3'UTR. This interaction affects breast cancer cell migration, as WSB2 overexpression can counteract the inhibitory effects of miR-28-5p (Ma2020miR‑28‑5p).
