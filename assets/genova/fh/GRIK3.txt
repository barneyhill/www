# GRIK3

## Overview
GRIK3 is a gene that encodes the glutamate ionotropic receptor kainate type subunit 3, also known as GluK3, which is a component of the kainate receptor family. These receptors are a subset of the ionotropic glutamate receptors, which are critical for mediating excitatory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. The GluK3 protein is a transmembrane receptor that plays a significant role in synaptic transmission and plasticity. Structurally, it forms a tetrameric complex with other kainate receptor subunits, contributing to the receptor's functional diversity and regulatory mechanisms (Kumari2019Structurala). GRIK3 has been implicated in various neurological and psychiatric disorders, as well as in cancer progression, highlighting its importance in both normal physiological processes and disease states (Xiao2019Glutamate; Begni2002Association).

## Structure
The GRIK3 gene encodes the GluK3 subunit of kainate receptors, which are part of the ionotropic glutamate receptor family. The protein structure includes several key domains: the amino-terminal domain (ATD), the ligand-binding domain (LBD), and the transmembrane domain (TM) (Kumari2019Structurala). The ATD is organized in a dimer of dimers configuration, while the TM domains exhibit a four-fold symmetry (Kumari2019Structurala). The LBD undergoes significant conformational changes between different states, adopting a symmetric arrangement in the desensitized state and an asymmetric configuration in the antagonist-bound state (Kumari2019Structurala).

The quaternary structure of GluK3 forms a tetrameric receptor complex, similar to other kainate receptors like GluK2 (Kumari2019Structurala). The receptor's architecture is characterized by a three-layered structure, with the ATD, LBD, and TM domains contributing to its overall assembly (Kumari2019Structurala). Post-translational modifications, such as N-linked glycosylation, play a crucial role in modulating the receptor's gating properties and stability, particularly at specific asparagine residues (Asn 247 and Asn 402) (Kumari2019Structurala). These modifications are essential for mediating inter-domain interactions and influencing the receptor's functional dynamics (Kumari2019Structurala).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GRIK3 gene have been associated with several neurological and psychiatric disorders. In schizophrenia, certain polymorphisms in GRIK3, such as the ser310ala polymorphism, have been linked to increased susceptibility. The ala310 allele is more prevalent in schizophrenic patients, suggesting a potential genetic risk factor (Begni2002Association). Other studies have identified specific haplotypes within GRIK3 that are significantly associated with schizophrenia, indicating a higher risk for the disorder (Djurovic2009A).

GRIK3 has also been implicated in recurrent major depressive disorder (R-MDD). A significant maternal association of the GluR7 T allele of the GRIK3 gene with R-MDD has been observed, suggesting that GRIK3 may be a susceptibility factor in mood disorders (Schiffer2006Association).

In type 2 diabetes patients, the GRIK3 gene is associated with diabetic retinopathy, a complication that can lead to visual loss and blindness. An increased proportion of GG homozygotes for the rs534131 polymorphism in GRIK3 has been found among patients with this condition (Kochetova2020The).

Alterations in GRIK3 expression have also been linked to cancer. In breast cancer, GRIK3 expression is higher in cancerous tissues and is associated with enhanced proliferation and migration of cancer cells, suggesting its role in cancer progression (Xiao2019Glutamate).

## Interactions
GRIK3, a subunit of kainate receptors, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. One notable interaction is with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). GRIK3 forms complexes with EGFR, suggesting a regulatory role in EGFR signaling pathways, which may impact cell proliferation and tumorigenesis (Xu2013A). This interaction indicates that GRIK3 could modulate cell proliferation through multiple mechanisms, including its association with EGFR.

In the context of cancer, GRIK3 has been shown to interact with the SPDEF/CDH1 signaling pathway. Overexpression of GRIK3 in breast cancer cells downregulates CDH1 and SPDEF, which are associated with cancer cell metastasis. Restoration of CDH1 or SPDEF expression in GRIK3-overexpressing cells suppresses the enhanced proliferation and migration induced by GRIK3, highlighting the importance of these interactions in cancer progression (Xiao2019Glutamate).

GRIK3 is also regulated by microRNAs in colorectal cancer. It is targeted by miR-1205 and miR-331-3p, which bind to its 3' UTR, affecting its expression. These interactions are crucial for the regulation of GRIK3 expression and its role in cancer cell proliferation and migration (Fang2021CircASXL1; Du2020Hsacirc0038646).
