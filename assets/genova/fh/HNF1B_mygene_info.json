transcription factors. The protein binds to DNA as either a homodimer, or a heterodimer with the related protein hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-alpha. The gene has been shown to function in nephron development, and regulates development of the embryonic pancreas. Mutations in this gene result in renal cysts and diabetes syndrome and noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and expression of this gene is altered in some types of cancer. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.[provided by RefSeq, Sep 2009].", "symbol": "HNF1B", "taxid": 9606, "type_of_gene": "protein-coding", "umls": {"cui": "C1420636"}, "unigene": "Hs.191144", "uniprot": {"Swiss-Prot": "P35680", "TrEMBL": ["Q6FHW6", "A0A0C4DGS8", "E0YMJ6", "A0A087WZC2", "E0YMJ8", "A0A087WXS2"]}, "wikipedia": {"url_stub": "HNF1B"}}
