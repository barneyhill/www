# BAIAP2L2

## Overview
BAIAP2L2 is a gene that encodes the BAR/IMD domain containing adaptor protein 2 like 2, a member of the I-BAR protein family. This protein is involved in the regulation of membrane curvature and actin cytoskeleton dynamics, playing a critical role in cellular processes such as mechanotransduction in cochlear hair cells. The protein is essential for the maintenance of stereocilia, which are crucial for hearing, and its absence can lead to progressive hearing loss (Carlton2020Loss). BAIAP2L2 is also implicated in various cancers, where its altered expression is associated with disease progression and prognosis, particularly in liver hepatocellular carcinoma and prostate cancer (Han2022Prognostic; Song2021BAIAP2L2). The protein's interactions with other cellular components underscore its importance in both normal physiological functions and pathological conditions (Yan2021BAIAP2L2).

## Structure


## Function
The BAIAP2L2 gene encodes a protein that is crucial for the maintenance of mechanotransducing stereocilia in cochlear hair cells, which are essential for hearing. This protein is a member of the I-BAR protein family, known for its ability to detect and induce negative membrane curvature and bind to actin, playing a significant role in actin filament assembly and cytoskeletal organization (Carlton2020Loss). BAIAP2L2 localizes to the tips of the shorter stereocilia in both inner and outer hair cells, where it interacts with several proteins, including CDC42, RAC1, EPS8, and ESPNL, which are important for the morphogenesis and maintenance of stereociliary bundles (Carlton2020Loss).

The protein's localization is dependent on the motor protein MYO15A and its cargo EPS8, indicating a complex transport mechanism to the stereocilia tips (Carlton2020Loss). In the absence of BAIAP2L2, there is a progressive loss of stereocilia rows, leading to a reduction in mechanotransduction (MET) currents and eventual deafness, highlighting its essential role in maintaining the structure and function of stereocilia (Yan2021BAIAP2L2; Carlton2020Loss).

## Clinical Significance
The BAIAP2L2 gene is implicated in several cancers, with alterations in its expression linked to disease progression and prognosis. In liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), BAIAP2L2 is overexpressed due to genetic alterations such as gene amplification and reduced DNA methylation. This overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and correlates with clinical features like histologic grade and tumor status (Han2022Prognostic). BAIAP2L2 also shows high diagnostic value for LIHC, with a significant area under the curve in ROC analysis (Han2022Prognostic).

In prostate cancer (PCa), BAIAP2L2 is significantly upregulated and linked to poor prognosis. It facilitates cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion through the VEGF and apoptosis signaling pathways. Silencing BAIAP2L2 in PCa cells inhibits these pathways, suggesting its role in tumorigenesis (Song2021BAIAP2L2).

In gastric cancer, BAIAP2L2 is highly expressed and associated with tumor characteristics such as size and metastasis. Its knockdown reduces cell proliferation and migration, indicating its role in cancer progression via the AKT/mTOR and Wnt3a/β-catenin pathways (Liu2020BAIAP2L2).

## Interactions
BAIAP2L2, also known as Pinkbar, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. In liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), BAIAP2L2 interacts with several proteins, including MTSS1, AMPH, FCHO1, SYT9, PDK2, MTSS1L, PM20D1, CHST4, and PALM3, forming a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. MTSS1 is highlighted as a novel biomarker of tumors, with its elevated expression linked to poor prognosis in liver cancer (Han2022Prognostic).

In cochlear hair cells, BAIAP2L2 interacts with proteins such as CDC42, RAC1, EPS8, and ESPNL, which are concentrated at the tips of stereocilia. These interactions are essential for the maintenance and stability of stereocilia, and the SH3 domain of BAIAP2L2 is necessary for these interactions (Carlton2020Loss). BAIAP2L2 also interacts with CAPZB2, TWF2, and EPS8L2, components of the row 2 complex in stereocilia, and its localization is dependent on CIB2, a component of the MET complex (Yan2021BAIAP2L2).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, BAIAP2L2 interacts with GABPB1, inhibiting its ubiquitin-mediated degradation and promoting its stability and nuclear translocation. This interaction is facilitated by the SH3 domain of BAIAP2L2 (Jia2022BAIAP2L2).
