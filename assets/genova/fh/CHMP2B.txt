# CHMP2B

## Overview
The CHMP2B gene encodes the charged multivesicular body protein 2B, a critical component of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport III (ESCRT-III). This protein plays a pivotal role in endosomal sorting, membrane remodeling, and synaptic function, particularly within neuronal cells. CHMP2B is characterized by its ability to cycle between monomeric and oligomerized states, forming part of a larger complex essential for its function in endosomal sorting (van2007CHMP2B). The protein's structural features include coiled-coil domains and a Snf-7 domain, which facilitate its interaction with lipid membranes and other ESCRT-III components (van2007CHMP2B). Mutations in the CHMP2B gene, such as C-terminal truncations, have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases like frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), underscoring its importance in maintaining neuronal health and function (GhaziNoori2012Progressive; van2007CHMP2B).

## Structure
The CHMP2B protein is a component of the ESCRT-III complex, involved in endosomal sorting. It is a 213-amino-acid protein with two coiled-coil domains located at residues 1-50 and 120-150, and a large predicted Snf-7 domain spanning residues 16-178 (van2007CHMP2B). The protein is characterized by a basic N-terminal and an acidic C-terminal half, which is typical of charged multivesicular body proteins (van2007CHMP2B).

CHMP2B cycles between a monomeric state in the cytosol and an oligomerized state in large ESCRT-III complexes on the endosome membrane (van2007CHMP2B). This oligomerization represents its quaternary structure, where it forms part of a larger complex essential for its function in endosomal sorting. The protein's ability to form a reticular-like network on membranes is indicative of its structural role in membrane remodeling (Alqabandi2021The).

Mutations in CHMP2B, such as C-terminal truncations, disrupt its normal function and lead to neurodegenerative diseases like frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) (van2007CHMP2B). These mutations can affect the protein's ability to bind with VPS4 AAA-ATPase, crucial for the recycling of ESCRT-III components (van2007CHMP2B).

## Function
The CHMP2B gene encodes a protein that is a core component of the ESCRT-III complex, which is crucial for various cellular processes, including endosomal sorting, membrane remodeling, and synaptic function. In healthy human cells, CHMP2B is involved in the trafficking of ubiquitinated proteins from endosomes to lysosomes, a process essential for lysosomal degradation. This function is part of the broader endo-lysosomal pathway, which is vital for the degradation of proteins like the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (Han2012The).

CHMP2B is highly expressed in neurons, particularly in dendritic spines, where it plays a significant role in maintaining dendritic branching, synapse density, and synaptic plasticity. It is part of a stable ESCRT-III complex associated with the postsynaptic cytoskeleton, suggesting its involvement in shaping dendritic spines and maintaining synaptic structures (Chassefeyre2015Regulation). The protein polymerizes into filaments that adhere to lipid membranes, altering their curvature, which is crucial for synaptic plasticity and receptor delivery in spines (Chassefeyre2015Regulation).

CHMP2B's interaction with other ESCRT-III components, such as CHMP4B, is essential for its function in dendrite morphogenesis and synaptic stability. Mutations affecting these interactions can lead to neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting the importance of CHMP2B in maintaining neuronal health (Chassefeyre2015Regulation; Han2012The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CHMP2B gene are linked to several neurodegenerative diseases, most notably frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). These mutations often result in C-terminal truncations of the CHMP2B protein, which disrupts its role in the endosomal sorting complex required for transport III (ESCRT-III), leading to defects in endosomal and autophagic trafficking (Urwin2009The; GhaziNoori2012Progressive). 

In FTD, particularly a form linked to chromosome 3 (FTD-3), CHMP2B mutations cause disruptions in endosome-lysosome fusion, leading to neuronal dysfunction (Urwin2010Disruption). Specific mutations, such as those affecting the splice site of exon 6, have been identified in Danish and Belgian families, resulting in truncated proteins and associated with familial FTD (Krasniak2016The; van2007CHMP2B).

In ALS, CHMP2B mutations are associated with a lower motor neuron predominant form of the disease. These mutations lead to cellular pathologies, including cytoplasmic vacuoles and impaired autophagy, contributing to the disease phenotype (Cox2010Mutations). The CHMP2B intron5 mutation, in particular, has been linked to a spectrum of symptoms encompassing both ALS and FTD, suggesting a pathological continuum between these conditions (Vernay2016A).

## Interactions
CHMP2B, a component of the ESCRT-III complex, is involved in various protein interactions crucial for its function. It interacts with CHMP4B, another ESCRT-III component, and this interaction is essential for maintaining synaptic stability and plasticity (Chassefeyre2015Regulation). CHMP2B also interacts with the Shank-Homer network and GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors, but not with GluA2-containing AMPA receptors, indicating its specific role in synaptic function (Chassefeyre2015Regulation).

Mutations in CHMP2B, such as T104N and Intron5, affect its interactions with other proteins. The T104N mutation reduces its interaction with VPS4B, a protein that helps dissociate ESCRT components from the endosomal membrane, while increasing its interaction with Snf7-2, another ESCRT-III component (Han2012The). The CHMP2B Intron5 mutation enhances its binding to spastin, a microtubule-severing protein, which is linked to hereditary spastic paraplegias (Chen2022The).

CHMP2B also shows a strong affinity for PI(4,5)P2-containing membranes, forming a reticulum-like structure that affects membrane rigidity. This interaction is modulated by CHMP3, which confines CHMP2B to patches on the membrane (Alqabandi2021The).
