# PHKG1

## Overview
The PHKG1 gene encodes the phosphorylase kinase catalytic subunit gamma 1, a critical component of the phosphorylase kinase (PhK) complex, which is a key regulatory enzyme in glycogen metabolism. As a kinase, the protein plays a pivotal role in the activation of glycogen phosphorylase, facilitating the breakdown of glycogen into glucose-1-phosphate, thus contributing to energy release, particularly in muscle and liver tissues (Winchester2007In). The PHKG1 gene is expressed in various tissues, including muscle, brain, heart, and tongue, indicating its broader role in energy metabolism beyond muscle-specific functions (Winchester2007In). The protein's activity is modulated by interactions with other subunits of the PhK complex, particularly the delta subunit, which binds calcium ions essential for enzyme activation (Boulatnikov2009Expressed). Mutations in PHKG1 have been linked to glycogen storage diseases, although they account for only a minority of cases, suggesting the involvement of additional genetic factors (Burwinkel2003Muscle).

## Structure
The PHKG1 gene encodes the gamma subunit of phosphorylase kinase, which plays a crucial role in glycogen metabolism. The primary structure of the PHKG1 protein includes amino acid sequences that form the basis for its function. The secondary structure likely consists of alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of kinase domains, although specific details are not provided in the context.

The tertiary structure of PHKG1 involves the 3D folding necessary for its catalytic activity, particularly in the context of its role in phosphorylase kinase. The quaternary structure of phosphorylase kinase is a large hexadecameric complex composed of four different subunits: α, β, γ, and δ, with the γ subunit, encoded by PHKG1, providing catalytic activity (Winchester2007In).

PHKG1 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different mRNA variants. One such variant is a truncated form that lacks the C-terminal calmodulin binding domains, suggesting a potential Ca2+-independent catalytic activity (Winchester2007In). This truncated variant includes an additional 21 amino acids, which are highly conserved among humans and primates, and contains a putative protein kinase C phosphorylation site, potentially influencing Ca2+ regulation (Winchester2007In). These splice variants may lead to isoforms with distinct functions and tissue-specific expression patterns (Winchester2007In).

## Function
The PHKG1 gene encodes the gamma subunit of phosphorylase kinase (PhK), a key regulatory enzyme in glycogen metabolism. PhK catalyzes the rate-limiting step in glycogenolysis by activating glycogen phosphorylase, which breaks down glycogen into glucose-1-phosphate. This process is crucial for maintaining blood glucose levels and providing energy for muscle contraction (Winchester2007In). Traditionally, PHKG1 has been considered a muscle-specific gene, encoding the cM subunit, while PHKG2 is liver-specific, encoding the cL subunit. However, PHKG1 is expressed in a variety of tissues beyond muscle, including the brain, heart, and tongue, suggesting a broader role in energy metabolism across different tissues (Winchester2007In).

In healthy human cells, PHKG1 is involved in the hormonal and neuronal control of glycogenolysis, playing a vital role in energy release in muscle and liver cells. The enzyme is active in the cytoplasm, particularly in tissues with high energy demands (Jones1990Localisation). The presence of an alternative intronic polyadenylation site in PHKG1 suggests potential regulatory mechanisms that may influence its expression and function in various tissues (Winchester2007In).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PHKG1 gene are associated with glycogen storage diseases, particularly affecting muscle tissue. In pigs, a specific splice mutation, g.8283C.A, in the PHKG1 gene leads to abnormal splicing of mRNA, resulting in a premature stop codon and reduced protein levels due to nonsense-mediated decay. This mutation causes phosphorylase kinase (PhK) enzyme deficiency, leading to high glycogen content in muscle, a condition known as muscle glycogenosis. This condition is characterized by low meat quality traits, such as low pH and water-holding capacity, commonly referred to as 'acid meat' (Ma2014A).

In humans, the PHKG1 gene has been investigated in the context of muscle glycogenosis with low PhK activity. However, mutations in PHKG1 explain only a minority of cases, suggesting that other genetic factors may contribute to the condition. The study found no sequence abnormalities in PHKG1 among patients with muscle glycogenosis, indicating that mutations in this gene are not a common cause of the disease (Burwinkel2003Muscle). The complexity of diagnosing PhK deficiency suggests that other genetic or biochemical factors may influence the condition (Burwinkel2003Muscle).

## Interactions
PHKG1, the gamma subunit of phosphorylase kinase, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its function in glycogen metabolism. It forms part of the phosphorylase kinase complex, which includes the alpha, beta, and delta subunits. The delta subunit, which is a calmodulin (CaM) subunit, binds calcium ions, a critical factor for the activation of the enzyme complex (Boulatnikov2009Expressed). The interaction between the gamma subunit and the delta subunit is essential for the enzyme's regulatory function, as calcium binding to the delta subunit modulates the activity of the gamma subunit (Boulatnikov2009Expressed).

PHKG1 is also involved in interactions that are influenced by phosphorylation. The activity of the gamma subunit is regulated by the phosphorylation of the alpha and beta subunits, which modulates the overall activity of the phosphorylase kinase complex (Guo2019Transcriptome). These interactions are crucial for the enzyme's role in glycogen breakdown, as they facilitate the phosphorylation and activation of glycogen phosphorylase.

Additionally, PHKG1 has been implicated in pathways related to glycogenolysis and carbohydrate metabolism, interacting with other proteins such as PYGM, PHKB, and PHKA1, which are involved in glycogen storage diseases (Hossain2016Towards).
