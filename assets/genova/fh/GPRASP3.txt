# GPRASP3

## Overview
GPRASP3 is a gene that encodes the protein G protein-coupled receptor associated sorting protein family member 3. This protein is part of a family involved in the regulation and sorting of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are critical for various cellular signaling pathways. GPRASP3 plays a role in the trafficking and degradation of GPCRs, influencing receptor availability and signaling efficacy. The protein is categorized as a sorting protein, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis by modulating receptor recycling and downregulation. Understanding the function and interactions of GPRASP3 is important for elucidating its role in physiological processes and potential implications in disease states.
