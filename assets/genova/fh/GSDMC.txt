# GSDMC

## Overview
GSDMC, or gasdermin C, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the gasdermin family, which is primarily involved in the process of pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death associated with inflammation. The gasdermin C protein is categorized as a pore-forming protein, playing a significant role in cellular processes such as differentiation, proliferation, and maintaining homeostasis by influencing cell membrane dynamics. It is predominantly active in the cytoplasm and is regulated by various signaling pathways, including the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) pathway. GSDMC is expressed in specific tissues, including keratinocytes, the trachea, and the spleen, and has been implicated in the progression of various cancers, where its upregulation is associated with poor prognosis (Zheng2022A; p&gt; Role; Li2020&lt).

## Function
GSDMC (gasdermin C) is a member of the gasdermin family, which plays a crucial role in pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death associated with inflammation. In healthy human cells, GSDMC is involved in cellular processes such as differentiation and proliferation. It is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it can form pores in the cell membrane, influencing cell signaling and maintaining homeostasis (p&gt; Role; Li2020&lt).

The protein's activity is regulated by various signaling pathways, including the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway, which is known to influence its expression levels. GSDMC is expressed in specific tissues such as keratinocytes, the trachea, and the spleen (Zheng2022A). While its role in healthy cells is not extensively detailed, the structural features shared with other gasdermin family members suggest that GSDMC may have similar functions related to cell membrane dynamics and inflammatory responses (p&gt; Role; Li2020&lt).

In the context of cancer, GSDMC has been observed to be upregulated in various cancers, where it can promote tumor cell proliferation and is associated with poor prognosis (Zheng2022A). However, its specific functions in non-cancerous cells remain less well-defined.

## Clinical Significance
The GSDMC gene has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), overexpression of GSDMC promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting its role as a potential therapeutic target. Knockdown of GSDMC in PAAD cell lines results in decreased cell proliferation and migration, indicating its significant role in tumor progression (Yan2022System). In breast cancer, high GSDMC expression is associated with poor overall survival and is linked to immune checkpoint regulation, suggesting its involvement in tumor immune evasion (Sun2022LINC00511hsamiR573). 

In colorectal cancer, GSDMC is upregulated in the presence of mutated APC and inactivation of TGFBR2, promoting cancer proliferation. It is not expressed in normal colonic tissues but is highly expressed in cancerous tissues, indicating its potential as an oncogene (Miguchi2016Gasdermin). GSDMC is also involved in pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death, which can enhance antitumor immunity. This role is significant in breast cancer, where GSDMC-mediated pyroptosis could be a therapeutic strategy (Hou2020PDL1mediated). These findings highlight GSDMC's potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target across various cancer types.

## Interactions
GSDMC (gasdermin C) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a crucial role in the process of pyroptosis. One significant interaction is with caspase-8, which cleaves GSDMC, a critical step for inducing pyroptosis. This interaction is particularly important in the context of α-ketoglutarate (α-KG)-induced pyroptosis, where caspase-8 is activated by the death receptor 6 (DR6) and subsequently cleaves GSDMC at the Asp240 site (Zhang2021The). The formation of DR6 receptosomes, which recruit caspase-8 and GSDMC, is essential for this process (Zhang2021The).

GSDMC also interacts with the nuclear PD-L1 (nPD-L1) and phosphorylated Stat3 (p-Y705-Stat3) complex, which binds to the GSDMC promoter, leading to its transcriptional activation under hypoxic conditions. This interaction facilitates the switch from apoptosis to pyroptosis in cancer cells (Hou2020PDL1mediated). The cleavage of GSDMC by caspase-8, activated by TNFα, is crucial for this switch, highlighting the role of GSDMC in tumor necrosis and its potential impact on antitumor immunity (Hou2020PDL1mediated). These interactions underscore GSDMC's involvement in complex cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target.
