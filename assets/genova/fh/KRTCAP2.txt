# KRTCAP2

## Overview
KRTCAP2 is a gene that encodes the keratinocyte-associated protein 2, a subunit of the mammalian oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex. This protein is integral to the process of N-glycosylation, a critical post-translational modification that occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum and is essential for proper protein folding and quality control in eukaryotic cells. Keratinocyte-associated protein 2 is characterized as a polytopic membrane protein with three transmembrane domains and a cytosolic C-terminal di-lysine motif, which facilitates its retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (Roboti2012Keratinocyteassociated). The protein is preferentially associated with the STT3A isoform of the OST complex, suggesting a role in co-translational N-glycosylation (Roboti2012Keratinocyteassociated). KRTCAP2 has been implicated in various clinical contexts, including cancer, where it may influence disease progression and serve as a prognostic marker (Lee2022Systematic; Liu2021A).

## Structure
Keratinocyte-associated protein 2 (KRTCAP2) is a subunit of the mammalian oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, characterized by its role in N-glycosylation of nascent proteins. The protein is a putative polytopic membrane protein with three transmembrane spans, as confirmed by trypsin protection assays, indicating its topology with the N-terminus in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen and the C-terminus in the cytosol (Roboti2012Keratinocyteassociated). KRTCAP2 contains a classical ER localization motif, specifically a C-terminal di-lysine motif (KKxx), which is crucial for its retention in the ER (Roboti2012Keratinocyteassociated).

The primary structure of KRTCAP2 is a 162-amino-acid polypeptide with an expected mass of approximately 18 kDa, although a predominant form of approximately 15 kDa is observed, likely due to alternative initiation of translation at downstream AUG codons (Met26 or Met27) (Roboti2012Keratinocyteassociated). The protein also features a single potential N-glycosylation site, which is a common post-translational modification affecting protein function and stability (Roboti2012Keratinocyteassociated). KRTCAP2 is preferentially incorporated into OST isoforms containing the STT3A subunit, although it also interacts with STT3B (Roboti2012Keratinocyteassociated; Hamieh2017Selenoprotein).

## Function
Keratinocyte-associated protein 2 (KCP2), encoded by the KRTCAP2 gene, functions as a subunit of the mammalian oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, which is crucial for N-glycosylation, a post-translational modification process essential for protein folding and quality control in eukaryotic cells (Roboti2012Keratinocyteassociated). KCP2 is particularly associated with the STT3A isoform of the OST complex, indicating its role in co-translational N-glycosylation (Roboti2012Keratinocyteassociated). 

KCP2 is characterized as a triple-spanning membrane protein with a cytosolic C-terminal di-lysine motif, which aids in its localization to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Roboti2012Keratinocyteassociated). This motif is crucial for the protein's retention in the ER, as it facilitates binding with coat protein I (COPI) components, which are involved in retrograde transport between the Golgi complex and the ER (Roboti2012Keratinocyteassociated).

The protein is expressed at higher levels in tissues with active secretion, such as the pancreas and liver, suggesting its involvement in glycoprotein synthesis (Roboti2012Keratinocyteassociated). KCP2's interaction with OST components, particularly STT3A and OST48, suggests it may modulate N-glycosylation efficiency in a substrate-specific manner, enhancing the processing of specific protein precursors (Roboti2012The).

## Clinical Significance
KRTCAP2 has been implicated in several types of cancer, suggesting its potential clinical significance. In gastric cancer, KRTCAP2 is associated with a protective effect, as indicated by a significant association with a reduced risk of the disease. This is supported by a burden test showing an odds ratio of 0.65, suggesting that mutations in KRTCAP2 may confer a protective effect against gastric cancer (Lee2022Systematic). 

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), KRTCAP2 is identified as a highly connected gene within the network of copy number alterations, indicating its potential influence on biological activities related to cancer (ElKafrawy2022Genomic). 

Additionally, KRTCAP2 is part of a six-gene signature associated with glycolysis and immune response, which serves as a prognostic predictor for uveal melanoma. This gene signature is linked to overall survival and immune cell infiltration, suggesting that KRTCAP2 may play a role in the immune microenvironment of this cancer type (Liu2021A). 

While KRTCAP2 is mentioned in the context of congenital disorders of glycosylation, it does not appear to be critical for specific glycosylation functions, as indicated by studies showing no impact on LOX N-glycosylation (Kas2023Functional).

## Interactions
Keratinocyte-associated protein 2 (KRTCAP2) is a subunit of the mammalian oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, which is involved in the N-glycosylation process within the endoplasmic reticulum. KRTCAP2 specifically interacts with the catalytic OST subunits STT3A and STT3B, with a stronger association observed with STT3A. This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation studies, where a significant proportion of overexpressed STT3A co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged KRTCAP2, and a fraction of endogenous STT3A was also found in complex with KRTCAP2. STT3B also co-immunoprecipitated with KRTCAP2, though to a lesser extent (Roboti2012Keratinocyteassociated).

KRTCAP2 is also associated with OST48, another subunit of the OST complex, indicating a specific interaction that is not mediated by STT3A or STT3B. This suggests that KRTCAP2 is preferentially incorporated into STT3A-containing isoforms of the OST complex (Roboti2012Keratinocyteassociated). The protein is characterized by three transmembrane spans and a cytosolic C-terminus, which includes a KKxx motif contributing to its localization in the endoplasmic reticulum (Roboti2012Keratinocyteassociated).
