# UBE2T

## Overview
UBE2T is a gene that encodes the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 T, a member of the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitination process, a post-translational modification critical for protein degradation, DNA repair, and cell cycle regulation. UBE2T is particularly significant in the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway, where it facilitates the monoubiquitination of the FANCI-FANCD2 complex, a crucial step in the repair of DNA interstrand cross-links (Stewart2016E2; Alpi2016Mechanism). Structurally, the enzyme is characterized by a conserved UBC domain and forms a specific complex with the RING domain of the E3 ligase FANCL, underscoring its specialized function in DNA repair (Hodson2014Structure). Clinically, mutations in UBE2T are associated with Fanconi anemia, while its overexpression is linked to various cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (PerezPeña2017Ubiquitinconjugating; Rickman2015Deficiency).

## Structure
UBE2T, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, is characterized by a typical UBC-fold, which includes a four-stranded beta meander flanked by an N-terminal helix and two C-terminal helices (Hodson2014Structure). The primary structure of UBE2T consists of 197 amino acids, with a conserved UBC domain essential for its catalytic activity (Huang2023Backbone). The tertiary structure of UBE2T has been resolved to a high degree of accuracy, with a root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) of 0.67 Å across all alpha-carbon atoms when comparing its bound and unbound forms, indicating minimal structural rearrangement upon binding (Hodson2014Structure).

In terms of quaternary structure, UBE2T forms a specific 1:1 stoichiometric complex with the RING domain of the E3 ligase FANCL, which is crucial for its role in the Fanconi Anemia pathway (Hodson2014Structure). The interaction between UBE2T and FANCL involves a conserved hydrophobic interface and specific electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions, highlighting the specificity of this E3-E2 pairing (Hodson2014Structure). UBE2T does not form complexes with other E2s, underscoring its unique interaction with FANCL (Hodson2014Structure).

## Function
UBE2T, also known as FANCT, is an E2-conjugating enzyme that plays a critical role in the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway, which is essential for maintaining genomic stability. In healthy human cells, UBE2T functions by facilitating the monoubiquitination of the FANCI-FANCD2 heterodimer, a key step in the FA pathway's signal transduction cascade. This process is crucial for recruiting DNA repair factors to sites of DNA damage, particularly in the repair of DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs) (Stewart2016E2; Alpi2016Mechanism).

UBE2T interacts specifically with the RING E3 ligase FANCL, forming a unique interface necessary for its function. This interaction is highly specific and is vital for regulating monoubiquitination events that maintain genomic stability (Alpi2016Mechanism). The enzyme is active in the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it contributes to cellular homeostasis by preventing chromosomal breakages and maintaining cellular integrity (Alpi2016Mechanism).

Mutations in UBE2T can lead to Fanconi anemia, characterized by congenital malformations, hematological abnormalities, and chromosomal instability, underscoring its importance in DNA repair processes (Alpi2016Mechanism).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the UBE2T gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in relation to Fanconi anemia and various cancers. UBE2T mutations are causative for the FA-T subtype of Fanconi anemia, as demonstrated by compound heterozygous mutations leading to cellular defects associated with this condition (Rickman2015Deficiency). In cancer, UBE2T is frequently overexpressed and linked to poor prognosis in several types, including breast, lung, gastric, prostate, nasopharyngeal, renal cell carcinoma, colorectal, and ovarian cancers (PerezPeña2017Ubiquitinconjugating; Cui2022UBE2T; Hao2019UBE2T; Alpi2016Mechanism; Wu2021Ubiquitinconjugating).

In breast and lung cancers, UBE2T overexpression is associated with poor outcomes and is amplified in a significant percentage of tumors (PerezPeña2017Ubiquitinconjugating). In renal cell carcinoma, high UBE2T expression correlates with decreased survival rates and is involved in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, promoting tumor growth (Hao2019UBE2T). In colorectal cancer, UBE2T facilitates the degradation of the tumor suppressor p53, enhancing cancer cell proliferation and invasion (Wu2021Ubiquitinconjugating). In ovarian cancer, UBE2T is linked to epithelial-mesenchymal transition and interacts with BRCA genes, suggesting a role in cancer development and progression (Cui2022UBE2T). These findings highlight UBE2T as a potential target for therapeutic interventions across various malignancies.

## Interactions
UBE2T, an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, is involved in several critical protein interactions, particularly within the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway. It interacts with the E3 ligase FANCL, forming a minimal E3 module essential for the monoubiquitination of the FANCI-FANCD2 heterodimer, a key step in DNA repair (Alpi2016Mechanism). This interaction is characterized by a unique interface involving specific residues, such as Tyr311 of FANCL and Arg60 of UBE2T, which extends beyond typical E3-E2 interactions (Alpi2016Mechanism).

UBE2T also interacts with FANCI, regulating its monoubiquitination, which is crucial for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) progression by promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Zhang2022UBE2T). In colorectal cancer, UBE2T facilitates the ubiquitination and degradation of the tumor suppressor protein p53, promoting cancer cell growth and proliferation (Wu2021Ubiquitinconjugating).

These interactions highlight UBE2T's role in various cellular processes, including DNA repair and cancer progression, through its ability to form specific complexes with other proteins, influencing their stability and function.
