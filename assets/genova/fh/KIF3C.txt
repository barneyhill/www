# KIF3C

## Overview
KIF3C is a gene that encodes the kinesin family member 3C, a motor protein belonging to the kinesin superfamily. This protein plays a critical role in intracellular transport, particularly within neuronal cells, by facilitating the movement of membranous organelles along microtubules. KIF3C forms a heterodimer with KIF3A, which is essential for its function in anterograde transport within axons and dendrites, thereby contributing to neuronal function and signaling (Yang1998Characterization; Muresan1998KIF3C). The protein is predominantly expressed in neural tissues, such as the brain and retina, but is also present in non-neuronal tissues, indicating a broader role in cellular transport processes (Muresan1998KIF3C). KIF3C's interactions with other proteins, including the fragile X mental retardation protein, underscore its involvement in the regulation of microtubule dynamics and local protein synthesis in neurons (Davidovic2007The; Gumy2013The). Additionally, KIF3C has been implicated in various cancers and hereditary conditions, highlighting its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Chen2023Double; Zhong2023The).

## Structure
KIF3C is a kinesin-like motor protein composed of 796 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 89,828 Da (Muresan1998KIF3C). The primary structure includes a unique 26-amino acid insertion in the motor domain, which is not found in other kinesin superfamily members (Yang1998Characterization). This insertion is part of a glycine-rich region within the motor domain, believed to be involved in conformational changes during the kinesin mechanochemical cycle (Muresan1998KIF3C).

The secondary structure of KIF3C features an α-helical coiled-coil region in the central stalk domain, which suggests potential for dimerization (Yang1998Characterization; Muresan1998KIF3C). The tertiary structure includes a globular tail domain at the C-terminus, which is similar to KIF3B and KRP95, and may be involved in protein or cargo interactions (Yang1998Characterization).

In terms of quaternary structure, KIF3C forms a heterodimer with KIF3A, but not with KIF3B, indicating specific interaction patterns (Muresan1998KIF3C). KIF3C is also associated with membrane vesicles and exhibits nucleotide-dependent microtubule-binding activity (Muresan1998KIF3C). The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which may contribute to its multiple isoelectric forms (Muresan1998KIF3C).

## Function
KIF3C is a kinesin motor protein involved in intracellular transport processes, particularly in neuronal cells. It forms a heteromeric complex with KIF3A, which is crucial for its function in transporting membranous organelles along microtubules. This complex is involved in the anterograde transport of vesicles and other cargo within axons and dendrites, contributing to the distribution of cellular components necessary for neuronal function and signaling (Yang1998Characterization; Muresan1998KIF3C).

KIF3C is primarily expressed in neural tissues, including the brain, spinal cord, and retina, where it is localized in cell bodies, dendrites, and axons. It is particularly concentrated in large neurons, cell bodies, and dendrites, with less frequent axonal staining (Yang1998Characterization; Muresan1998KIF3C). The protein is also found in non-neuronal tissues such as the kidney, pancreas, and lung, suggesting a broader role in intracellular membrane trafficking and sorting (Muresan1998KIF3C).

KIF3C exhibits nucleotide-dependent microtubule-binding activity, characteristic of kinesins, and is likely a plus-end-directed motor, although its motor activity and directionality have not been directly demonstrated (Muresan1998KIF3C). Its role in fast axonal transport is supported by its high concentration in the optic nerve (Muresan1998KIF3C).

## Clinical Significance
The KIF3C gene is implicated in various cancers and hereditary conditions due to its altered expression and mutations. In gastric cancer, KIF3C is overexpressed, correlating with poor prognosis and promoting malignant behaviors such as cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Knockdown of KIF3C in gastric cancer cells results in reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhong2023The). In prostate cancer, KIF3C is highly expressed and associated with poor prognosis, promoting proliferation and invasion. Its expression is regulated by m6A modification, which stabilizes KIF3C mRNA (Ma2021METTL3mediated).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), KIF3C acts as an oncogene, with high expression linked to advanced disease stages and poor survival outcomes. It is modulated by microRNAs miR-150-5p and miR-186-3p, which can inhibit its oncogenic effects (Liu2021Kinesin). KIF3C is also involved in hereditary gingival fibromatosis, where mutations lead to increased expression and activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, contributing to fibrotic activity (Chen2023Double). These findings highlight KIF3C's role in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
KIF3C, a member of the kinesin superfamily, participates in several protein interactions crucial for its function in intracellular transport. It forms a complex with KIF3A, but not with KIF3B, indicating a specific interaction pattern within the kinesin-II family (Yang1998Characterization; Muresan1998KIF3C). This complex formation is facilitated by the coiled-coil region, suggesting direct interaction between KIF3C and KIF3A (Muresan1998KIF3C). KIF3C also associates with a kinesin-associated protein (KAP) subunit, specifically KAP3, which is a common feature in KIF3A/KIF3B and KIF3A/KIF3C complexes (Yang1998Characterization).

KIF3C interacts with the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), acting as a molecular adaptor between FMRP and dendritic RNA granules. This interaction is crucial for the transport of RNA granules along neuronal microtubules, facilitating local protein synthesis in neurons (Davidovic2007The). The interaction between KIF3C and FMRP is protein-protein based and involves the C-terminal region of KIF3C, which serves as a cargo docking domain (Davidovic2007The). These interactions highlight KIF3C's role in neuronal transport processes and its involvement in the regulation of microtubule dynamics during axon growth and regeneration (Gumy2013The).
