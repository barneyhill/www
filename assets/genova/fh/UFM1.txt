# UFM1

## Overview
UFM1 (ubiquitin fold modifier 1) is a gene that encodes a small ubiquitin-like protein involved in a post-translational modification process known as UFMylation. This protein is characterized by a ubiquitin-like fold and plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including maintaining endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis, modulating the unfolded protein response, and participating in the DNA damage response. UFM1 is synthesized as a precursor and undergoes post-translational processing to become active, interacting with specific enzymes such as Uba5 and Ufc1 to facilitate its conjugation to target proteins. The UFM1 protein is integral to cellular homeostasis and has been implicated in several clinical conditions, including neurological disorders and cancer, due to its role in protein stability and function (Komatsu2004A; Witting2021Highly; Hamilton2017UFM1).

## Structure
UFM1 (ubiquitin fold modifier 1) is a small protein with a molecular mass of approximately 9.1 kDa, consisting of 85 amino acids. It is characterized by a ubiquitin-like fold, specifically a β-grasp structure, which includes secondary structure elements ordered as β-β-α-β-β-α (Komatsu2004A; Kim2018Structural). Despite its structural similarity to ubiquitin, UFM1 shares only 16% sequence identity with it (Ha2008Structural).

UFM1 is synthesized as a precursor and undergoes post-translational processing to expose a conserved C-terminal glycine residue, which is crucial for its conjugation to target proteins. This processing involves cleavage at the C-terminus, similar to ubiquitin, where the C-terminal Gly-Gly sequence is essential (Ha2008Structural; Komatsu2004A). The mature form of UFM1 is activated by the E1-like enzyme Uba5 and transferred to the E2-like enzyme Ufc1, facilitating its role in protein conjugation (Komatsu2004A).

The interaction of UFM1 with its specific protease, UfSP, involves key residues such as Pro88, Arg89, and Val92, which are crucial for its recognition and binding (Kim2018Structural). These interactions highlight the specificity of UFM1 in its biological functions.

## Function
UFM1 (ubiquitin fold modifier 1) is a ubiquitin-like protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes through a post-translational modification process known as UFMylation. This process involves the covalent attachment of UFM1 to target proteins, influencing their stability and function. UFM1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it is involved in maintaining ER homeostasis and managing ER stress. It modulates the unfolded protein response (UPR) by interacting with proteins such as DDRGK1 and UFL1, which are part of the UFM1 system, helping to stabilize key UPR signal transducers like IREα (Wang2023The; Witting2021Highly).

UFM1 is also involved in transcriptional regulation, particularly in the modulation of estrogen receptor α (ERα) transactivation, and the expression of genes critical for erythropoiesis. It facilitates the UFMylation of the activating signal co-integrator 1 (ASC1), crucial for ERα transactivation and the transcriptional activation of ERα target genes (Witting2021Highly). UFM1 plays a critical role in the DNA damage response by facilitating the formation and recruitment of the MRN complex to DNA damage sites, essential for proper ATM activation and DNA repair (Witting2021Highly). These functions underscore UFM1's importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing disease onset.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the UFM1 gene are associated with several severe neurological disorders. One notable condition is hypomyelinating leukodystrophy type 14, characterized by improper myelin formation in the central nervous system. This disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and presents with symptoms such as hypotonia, spasticity, seizures, and developmental delays. A specific mutation, c.-155_-153delTCA, is identified as a founder mutation in the Roma population, with a carrier frequency of 3-25%. Patients with this mutation often experience severe developmental delay, microcephaly, and a median survival of two years (Hamilton2017UFM1; Szűcs2021Four).

The UFM1 gene is also implicated in a recessive variant of hypomyelination with atrophy of the basal ganglia and cerebellum (H-ABC). This condition is marked by severe encephalopathy, developmental delay, and early death. The mutation c.-273_-271delTCA in the UFM1 promoter region is prevalent in the Roma population and is associated with a severe clinical phenotype, including lack of development and severe epileptic encephalopathy (Hamilton2017UFM1).

Alterations in UFM1 expression have been linked to various diseases, including cancer and diabetes, where it plays a role in cellular stress responses and apoptosis (Yu2019The).

## Interactions
UFM1 (ubiquitin fold modifier 1) is involved in various protein interactions, primarily through the UFMylation pathway. It interacts with the UBA5 enzyme via a conserved LIR/UFIM motif, which is crucial for binding and facilitating the ufmylation process. This interaction is characterized by nonpolar interactions involving key residues such as Trp-341, Ile-343, and Val-346, which stabilize the UFM1-UBA5 complex (Habisov2016Structural). UFM1 also competes with LC3/GABARAP proteins for binding to the LIR/UFIM motif, highlighting its specificity and competitive nature in these interactions (Habisov2016Structural).

UFM1 is part of a multiprotein complex involving UFL1 and UFBP1, which plays a role in ribosome UFMylation. The UFM1 E3 ligase complex, including UFL1, UFBP1, and CDK5RAP3, recognizes and releases 60S ribosomes from ER translocons, with UFM1 being 'sandwiched' between specific domains of UFBP1 (Makhlouf2024The). UFM1 also interacts with ribosomal proteins such as RPL26, influencing protein translation and stability (Banerjee2020Decrypting). These interactions are essential for various cellular processes, including ER-phagy and the DNA damage response (Ishimura2022The; Banerjee2020Decrypting).
