# RAMAC

## Overview
The RAMAC gene encodes the RNA guanine-7 methyltransferase activating subunit, a critical component in the post-transcriptional modification of RNA. This protein functions as an activating subunit within the RNA guanine-7 methyltransferase complex, playing a pivotal role in the methylation of RNA by facilitating the addition of a methyl group to the guanine base at the 7th position, forming the m7G cap. This cap is essential for RNA stability, nuclear export, and efficient translation, underscoring the importance of RAMAC in gene expression and mRNA stability (Trotman2018A). The RAMAC protein interacts with RNA guanine-7 methyltransferase (RNMT) to form a heterodimeric complex, which is crucial for the methylation process and the maintenance of mRNA integrity (Varshney2016Molecular). Through its interaction with RNMT, RAMAC enhances the catalytic efficiency of the methyltransferase, highlighting its role as a regulatory subunit in RNA processing (Varshney2016Molecular).

## Function
The RAMAC gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the methylation of RNA, specifically facilitating the addition of a methyl group to the guanine base at the 7th position, forming the m7G cap. This modification is essential for RNA stability, nuclear export, and efficient translation. RAMAC functions as an activating subunit in the RNA guanine-7 methyltransferase complex, primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it stimulates the activity of RNA guanine-7 methyltransferase (RNMT) (Trotman2018A). 

In healthy human cells, RAMAC is involved in the process of mRNA recapping, which restores the N7-methylguanosine cap on the 5' end of eukaryotic mRNAs. This cap is crucial for gene expression and mRNA stability, as it protects mRNA from degradation and facilitates translation initiation (Trotman2018A). RAMAC, in conjunction with RNMT, forms a heterodimeric cap methyltransferase complex that is involved in the methylation of the cap at the N7 position, ensuring that only properly capped mRNAs are expressed (Trotman2018A). The interaction between RAMAC and RNMT is vital for the formation of the cytoplasmic capping metabolon, which regenerates cap 0 on uncapped RNA, highlighting its role in maintaining mRNA integrity and function (Trotman2018A).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
The RNA guanine-7 methyltransferase activating subunit (RAMAC) interacts with RNA guanine-7 methyltransferase (RNMT) to facilitate the methylation of RNA molecules. The RAMAC protein, specifically its activation domain (residues 2-45), binds to a positively charged surface groove on RNMT, which is distant from the active site. This interaction stabilizes a lobe structure in RNMT that co-evolved with RAMAC, necessary for RAMAC binding (Varshney2016Molecular). The binding of RAMAC results in the optimal positioning of helix A in RNMT, crucial for substrate interaction in the active site, and increases the recruitment of the methyl donor, AdoMet, thereby allosterically activating RNMT (Varshney2016Molecular).

The interaction between RAMAC and RNMT is primarily charge-based, involving electrostatic interactions between negatively charged residues of RAMAC and a positively charged groove on RNMT. This interaction neutralizes and stabilizes repulsive forces between the RNMT lobe and α-helix hinge, enhancing RNMT's catalytic efficiency (Varshney2016Molecular). Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that these interactions are stable, with RAMAC binding stabilizing specific regions of RNMT, such as the α-helix hinge and helix A, which are important for maintaining the active site's conformation (Varshney2016Molecular).
