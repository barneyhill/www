# ME1

## Overview
The ME1 gene encodes the cytosolic enzyme malic enzyme 1, which is a key player in cellular metabolism. This enzyme is classified as an oxidoreductase and is responsible for catalyzing the oxidative decarboxylation of malate to pyruvate, a reaction that concurrently generates NADPH from NADP+. The production of NADPH is crucial for various biosynthetic processes, including lipid and cholesterol synthesis, as well as for maintaining redox balance within the cell (Alektiar2024Malic; Simmen2020Malic). Structurally, malic enzyme 1 is a tetrameric protein, with its active site located at the interface of specific domains, facilitating its enzymatic function (Hsieh2014Structural). ME1 is involved in several metabolic pathways and interacts with other enzymes to enhance NADPH production, playing a significant role in both normal cellular physiology and pathological conditions such as cancer (Simmen2020Malic; Yao2017Evidence).

## Structure
The human ME1 gene encodes the cytosolic NADP-dependent malic enzyme, which catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of malate to pyruvate, producing NADPH. The enzyme is composed of a primary structure of amino acids that form specific domains. The monomeric unit of ME1 consists of four domains: Domain A (residues 23-130) is predominantly helical and binds fumarate; Domain B (residues 131-277 and 464-535) contains a central five-stranded parallel β-sheet surrounded by helices; Domain C (residues 278-463) features a dinucleotide-binding Rossmann fold with a modification; and Domain D (residues 536-579) includes one helix followed by a long extended random coil structure (Hsieh2014Structural).

The active site of ME1 is located at the interface of domains B and C, while domains A and D are involved in dimer and tetramer formation. The enzyme exists as a stable tetramer, organized as a dimer of dimers, which is crucial for its structural integrity and function (Hsieh2014Structural). The quaternary structure is maintained by specific interactions, such as salt bridges and hydrophobic interactions, which are essential for the enzyme's stability (Hsieh2009Functional). The enzyme is noncooperative and nonallosteric, distinguishing it from its mitochondrial counterpart (Hsieh2014Structural).

## Function
Malic enzyme 1 (ME1) is a cytosolic enzyme that plays a crucial role in intermediary metabolism by catalyzing the oxidative decarboxylation of malate to pyruvate, while concurrently reducing NADP+ to NADPH. This reaction is significant for lipid and cholesterol biosynthesis, as NADPH is a necessary cofactor for these processes (Alektiar2024Malic; Simmen2020Malic). ME1 is involved in linking cytosolic and mitochondrial processes through the production of pyruvate, which is further converted to acetyl-CoA in the mitochondria, facilitating the synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol (Alektiar2024Malic).

In healthy cells, ME1 contributes to the cytosolic NADPH pool, which is essential for antioxidative stress pathways, detoxification, and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Simmen2020Malic). It supports the biosynthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol, counteracts ROS, and participates in the transfer of excess mitochondrial acetyl-CoA to the cytosol for incorporation into cholesterol and fatty acids (Simmen2020Malic). ME1 is also involved in the Warburg effect, characteristic of many cancer cells, by participating in aerobic glycolysis and lactate secretion (Simmen2020Malic). The enzyme's activity is regulated by post-translational modifications, such as acetylation and phosphorylation, which affect its interactions with other metabolic pathways (Simmen2020Malic).

## Clinical Significance
Malic enzyme 1 (ME1) plays a significant role in cancer biology, with its expression levels and interactions influencing various cancer types. Elevated ME1 expression is observed in several tumors, including those in the gastrointestinal tract, hepatobiliary system, and aerodigestive tract, and is associated with poor prognosis and adverse patient outcomes (Simmen2020Malic). In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), high ME1 expression predicts post-transplant survival and is linked to increased leukocyte proliferation and resistance to standard chemotherapy, although it shows sensitivity to kinase inhibitors (Ortiz2022High). ME1's role in NADPH production is crucial for redox homeostasis, protecting tumor cells from reactive oxygen species during proliferation (Ortiz2022High).

In basal-like breast cancer (BLBC), ME1 is significantly upregulated, promoting aerobic glycolysis and contributing to larger tumor size, higher grade, and chemotherapy resistance (Liao2018ME1). ME1 expression enhances glucose uptake and lactate production, while its knockdown decreases these processes, indicating its role in the Warburg effect (Liao2018ME1). High ME1 expression correlates with poorer overall survival and relapse-free survival in breast cancer patients (Liao2018ME1). These findings suggest that ME1 is a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target in various cancers.

## Interactions
Malic enzyme 1 (ME1) is known to interact with 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD), a key enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway. This interaction enhances the enzymatic activity of 6PGD without relying on ME1's own enzymatic function. ME1 forms a hetero-oligomer complex with 6PGD, which increases the binding affinity of 6PGD to its substrate, thereby promoting NADPH generation and cell proliferation. This interaction is crucial for the activation of 6PGD and is independent of ME1's enzymatic activity (Yao2017Evidence).

ME1 also interacts with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), another enzyme involved in NADPH production. This interaction enhances G6PD's activity and substrate binding, suggesting a coordinated network of NADPH metabolic pathways involving ME1, 6PGD, and G6PD (Yao2017Evidence).

The interaction between ME1 and 6PGD has been confirmed through various experimental methods, including immunoprecipitation and surface plasmon resonance, with a dissociation constant of approximately 14.3 μM, indicating a specific and measurable interaction (Yao2017Evidence). These findings highlight ME1's role in modulating metabolic pathways through structural interactions with other enzymes.
