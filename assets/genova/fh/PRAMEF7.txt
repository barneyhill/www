# PRAMEF7

## Overview
PRAMEF7 is a gene that encodes the protein PRAME family member 7, which is part of the PRAME (Preferentially Expressed Antigen in Melanoma) gene family. This family is known for its involvement in various biological processes, including immune response and cancer biology. PRAME family member 7 is categorized as a cancer-testis antigen, a group of proteins typically expressed in a wide range of tumors but with limited expression in normal tissues, making them potential targets for cancer immunotherapy. The gene has been implicated in several diseases, including speech and language disorders, endometrial cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY), highlighting its diverse roles in human health and disease (Lei2017Axon; Deng2019Identification; MosconaNissan2024Whole).

## Clinical Significance
PRAMEF7, a member of the PRAME gene family, has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to mutations and alterations in its expression. In the context of speech and language disorders, PRAMEF7 is suggested to play a role in axon guidance pathways, which are critical for speech and language evolution. Mutations in the PRAME gene family, including PRAMEF7, have been observed in patients with these disorders, indicating a potential link to speech and language impairments (Lei2017Axon).

In cancer, PRAMEF7 is part of the cancer-testis antigen group, which is predominantly expressed in tumors and has been identified as a potential biomarker for endometrial cancer. A specific missense mutation in PRAMEF7, c.[1037T>C], has been noted in this context (HNRNPCL1&lt; &lt; em&gt; /em&gt; Gao2020&lt; p&gt). Additionally, PRAMEF7 mutations have been detected in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, with a mutation rate of 2.6% in a study cohort, suggesting its involvement in the disease's molecular pathogenesis (Deng2019Identification).

PRAMEF7 has also been associated with Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY), where its variant distribution showed statistical significance, indicating a potential role in the disease (MosconaNissan2024Whole).
