# FHIP1A

## Overview
FHIP1A is a gene that encodes the protein FHF complex subunit HOOK interacting protein 1A, which is a critical component of the FTS-Hook-FHIP (FHF) complex. This protein is involved in intracellular transport processes, particularly in linking cytoplasmic dynein-1, a motor protein, to various cellular cargos, thereby facilitating their movement along microtubules. FHIP1A interacts with Hook proteins, such as Hook1 and Hook3, to form complexes that are essential for the association with motile dynein/dynactin complexes, indicating its significant role in cellular transport mechanisms (Christensen2021Cytoplasmic). Additionally, FHIP1A is implicated in endosomal transport and is associated with the AP-4 adaptor complex and the transferrin receptor, suggesting its involvement in transferrin receptor recycling or other endosome-related functions (Christensen2021Cytoplasmic). The protein's interactions and functions are crucial for maintaining cellular organization and signaling pathways, highlighting its importance in cellular function and structure (Christensen2021Cytoplasmic).

## Function
FHIP1A, also known as FHF complex subunit HOOK interacting protein 1A, is a component of the FTS-Hook-FHIP (FHF) complex, which plays a crucial role in intracellular transport processes. This complex is involved in linking cytoplasmic dynein-1, a motor protein, to various cellular cargos, facilitating their movement along microtubules. FHIP1A interacts with Hook proteins, specifically Hook1 and Hook3, to form complexes that associate with motile dynein/dynactin complexes, suggesting its involvement in cellular transport mechanisms (Christensen2021Cytoplasmic).

FHIP1A is implicated in endosomal transport, as it is associated with the AP-4 adaptor complex and the transferrin receptor (TFR), indicating a role in TFR recycling or other endosome-adjacent functions (Christensen2021Cytoplasmic). The protein's expression is notably lower in certain cell lines, suggesting it may have more prominent roles in other cell types (Christensen2021Cytoplasmic).

The FHF complex, including FHIP1A, is essential for the diversity of cytoplasmic dynein-1 cargo, impacting cellular organization and signaling pathways. Through its interactions, FHIP1A contributes to the regulation of dynein/dynactin-mediated transport processes, which are vital for maintaining cellular function and structure (Christensen2021Cytoplasmic).

## Interactions
FHIP1A, a component of the FHF complex, interacts with various proteins, particularly within the context of cytoplasmic dynein-1 cargo transport. It forms complexes with Hook proteins, specifically Hook1 and Hook3, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments in 293T cells. These interactions are crucial for the association of FHIP1A with dynein/dynactin complexes, which are involved in cellular motility (Christensen2021Cytoplasmic). The BioID approach revealed that FHIP1A's protein interactome is enriched for endosome-associated proteins, consistent with its role in endosomal functions. The dataset also indicated potential interactions with cytoskeletal components, as suggested by the presence of kinesin hits (Christensen2021Cytoplasmic).

FHIP1A shares many interactome hits with FHIP1B, indicating partial redundancy. Both proteins associate with the AP-4 adaptor complex, and FHIP1A uniquely interacts with the transferrin receptor and sorting nexins SNX2 and SNX30, suggesting a role in transferrin receptor recycling or related endosomal functions (Christensen2021Cytoplasmic). The FHF complex, involving FHIP1A, is recruited to endosome cargo and interacts with KIF1C, a kinesin-3 motor, which facilitates dynein movement by partially opening Hook3 and recruiting dynein/dynactin (Ali2023KIF1C).
