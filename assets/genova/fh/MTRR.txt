# MTRR

## Overview
The MTRR gene encodes the enzyme 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase reductase, commonly referred to as methionine synthase reductase (MSR). This enzyme is a member of the ferredoxin-NADP(+) reductase (FNR) family and functions as a flavoprotein, playing a pivotal role in the folate and homocysteine metabolic pathways. MSR is essential for the regeneration of methionine synthase (MTR) to its active form, facilitating the conversion of homocysteine to methionine, a critical process for DNA synthesis, repair, and cellular methylation reactions (Zhang2020The). The MTRR gene's product is characterized by its ability to bind flavin mononucleotide (FMN), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), and NADP(H), which are crucial for its electron transfer function (Sadhukhan2020Structural). Mutations in the MTRR gene have been associated with various clinical conditions, including homocystinuria, neural tube defects, and an increased risk of certain cancers, underscoring its significance in human health (Leclerc1998Cloning; Ohnami2008His595Tyr).

## Structure
The MTRR gene encodes the methionine synthase reductase protein, which plays a crucial role in the folate and homocysteine metabolic pathways. The primary structure of MTRR consists of 698 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 77,700 Da (Leclerc1998Cloning). The protein is a member of the FNR family of electron transferases and shares significant sequence identity with human cytochrome P450 reductase and C. elegans methionine synthase reductase (Leclerc1998Cloning).

The secondary structure of MTRR includes domains for binding flavin mononucleotide (FMN), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), and NADP(H), which are essential for its function in electron transfer (Sadhukhan2020Structural). The tertiary structure is characterized by a hinge region connecting the FMN binding domain to the connecting domain, facilitating the protein's dynamic function (Sadhukhan2020Structural).

MTRR's quaternary structure involves interactions that are crucial for its function, as evidenced by the impact of polymorphic variations like the I49M mutation, which affects the protein's functional dynamics without significantly altering its structural stability (Sadhukhan2020Structural). The protein's structure is further refined through molecular dynamics simulations, ensuring high stereochemical quality (Sadhukhan2020Structural).

## Function
The MTRR gene encodes the enzyme methionine synthase reductase (MSR), which is crucial for the folate-homocysteine metabolism pathway in eukaryotic cells. This enzyme is a member of the ferredoxin-NADP(+) reductase (FNR) family and functions as a flavoprotein containing FAD and FMN. Its primary role is to regenerate methionine synthase (MTR) to an active state by transferring electrons from NADPH to FAD to FMN to cob(II)alamin, a process essential for the synthesis of methionine (Zhang2020The). Methionine is a vital amino acid necessary for DNA synthesis, repair, and cellular methylation reactions. MTRR activity occurs in the cytoplasm and is critical for maintaining normal cellular function and preventing homocysteine accumulation, which can lead to cardiovascular and neurological disorders.

The N-terminus of MTRR, particularly the conserved FMN_Red domain, plays a significant role in the oxidation-reduction process and is implicated in MTR reactivation beyond just electron transfer. Variations in this region can affect the enzyme's ability to promote MTR catalysis, potentially leading to clinical conditions like spina bifida (Zhang2020The). The N-terminus can promote MTR enzymatic activity through an allosteric effect, despite the lack of direct interaction between MTRR and MTR (Zhang2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MTRR gene are associated with several clinical conditions. One significant condition linked to MTRR mutations is homocystinuria, characterized by elevated homocysteine levels in the blood, which can lead to cardiovascular problems, skeletal abnormalities, and neurological symptoms (Leclerc1998Cloning). The MTRR gene is crucial for the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine, and defects in this process can result in hyperhomocysteinemia, contributing to the pathology of homocystinuria (Richard2012Oxidative).

Alterations in the MTRR gene have also been implicated in the risk of nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P). The MTRR A66G polymorphism significantly increases the risk of NSCL/P, with specific genotypes showing higher odds ratios compared to others (Wang2016MTR). Additionally, the His595Tyr polymorphism in the MTRR gene is associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer, particularly under a recessive model (Ohnami2008His595Tyr).

Furthermore, the MTRR gene has been linked to neural tube defects (NTDs) such as spina bifida, especially when combined with low cobalamin (vitamin B12) levels. The I22M polymorphism in the MTRR gene may increase the risk of NTDs, highlighting the interaction between genetic and nutritional factors (Wilson1999A).

## Interactions
MTRR (5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase reductase) is involved in the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine, a process crucial for DNA synthesis and repair. It interacts with methionine synthase (MTR) by regenerating its active form, which is essential for maintaining MTR stability and facilitating cobalamin uptake necessary for homocysteine methylation (Portillo2020Proteinprotein). The N-terminus of MTRR plays a significant role in these interactions, particularly through its conserved FMN_Red domain, which is involved in the oxidation-reduction process. This region is crucial for the electron transfer necessary for MTR reactivation (Zhang2020The).

The N-terminal arginine residues of MTRR are highly conserved and play a critical role in binding MTR, enhancing MTR enzymatic activities for methionine formation. Deletion of these arginines reduces the ability to stimulate MTR catalysis due to weakened binding affinity and altered 3D structure and electrostatic potential (Zhang2020The). These interactions are not only important for electron transfer but also for promoting MTR catalysis, acting as a molecular chaperone that influences MTR activity depending on the state of the enzyme and the specific N-terminal sequence of MTRR (Zhang2020The).
