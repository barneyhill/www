# SLC35G6

## Overview
SLC35G6 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 35 member G6, which is part of the solute carrier (SLC) family of proteins. These proteins are typically involved in the transport of various molecules across cellular membranes, and SLC35G6 is believed to function as a transmembrane transporter. While the specific substrates and physiological roles of SLC35G6 remain to be fully elucidated, its expression has been linked to certain pathological conditions, particularly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with lymphomatous effusions. The gene's expression profile and potential involvement in disease pathways suggest it may serve as a biomarker for specific lymphoma phenotypes, although further research is needed to confirm its broader clinical significance (Abdollahi2021Deciphering; Spreiz2013Chromosomal).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
SLC35G6 has been implicated in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with lymphomatous effusions. Research indicates that SLC35G6 is pathogenic in a significant number of effusion-associated DLBCL cases, suggesting its potential role in the aggressive spread of lymphoma cells. The gene was found to be pathogenic in 8 out of 9 effusion-associated DLBCL samples, highlighting its specific association with the effusion phenotype of this lymphoma type (Abdollahi2021Deciphering). This suggests that SLC35G6 could serve as a potential biomarker for effusion-associated DLBCL, although further validation is required to confirm its clinical significance (Abdollahi2021Deciphering).

The study also noted higher expression levels of SLC35G6 in DLBCL cell lines compared to lymphoblastoid cell lines, although the lack of an available antibody prevented validation of its protein expression (Abdollahi2021Deciphering). Despite these findings, the clinical significance of SLC35G6 in other conditions remains unclear, as other studies have not provided specific information on its role in diseases outside of DLBCL (Gu2020Molecular; Spreiz2013Chromosomal).
