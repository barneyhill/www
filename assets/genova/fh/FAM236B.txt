# FAM236B

## Overview
FAM236B is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 236 member B. This protein is part of a larger family characterized by conserved sequence motifs, although its specific biological role remains to be fully elucidated. The FAM236B protein is implicated in various cellular processes, potentially involving signal transduction pathways, given its structural features that suggest a role in intracellular signaling. Research into the FAM236B gene and its encoded protein is ongoing, with studies aiming to clarify its function and interactions within the cell, as well as its potential implications in human health and disease.
