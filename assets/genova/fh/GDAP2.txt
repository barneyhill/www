# GDAP2

## Overview
The GDAP2 gene encodes the ganglioside induced differentiation associated protein 2, which is a member of the GDAP family. This protein is characterized by the presence of an N-terminal macro domain and a C-terminal CRAL-TRIO domain, which are involved in lipid binding and transport, as well as signal transduction processes (Dong2020Novel). The GDAP2 protein is predominantly expressed in the human brain, particularly in the cerebellum, indicating its potential role in neurological functions and stress adaptation (Dong2020Novel; Eidhof2018GDAP2). Although the specific interactions and functions of GDAP2 are not fully elucidated, its involvement in lipid-mediated signaling pathways and its unique interaction profile, distinct from other macrodomain proteins, suggest a specialized role in cellular processes (Sowa2021A; Rack2016Macrodomains:). Mutations in the GDAP2 gene have been associated with neurodegenerative disorders, such as autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia-27, highlighting its clinical significance (Breza2020A; Eidhof2018GDAP2).

## Structure


## Function
The GDAP2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the GDAP family, characterized by the presence of an N-terminal macro domain and a lipid-binding CRAL-TRIO domain. These domains are involved in significant biological processes, including signal transduction, lipid transport, and the maintenance of cellular compartments and membranes (Dong2020Novel). The CRAL-TRIO domain, in particular, is known for binding small lipophilic molecules, which integrates lipid metabolism with other biochemical processes. This domain's integrity is crucial, as damage to it is implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, including spinocerebellar ataxia (Dong2020Novel).

GDAP2 is highly expressed in the human brain, especially in the cerebellum, suggesting its importance in neurological functions (Dong2020Novel). Although the specific functions of GDAP2 in healthy human cells are not fully elucidated, its involvement in maintaining cellular stress equilibrium is suggested by studies showing that GDAP2 mRNA levels decrease under oxidative stress and starvation conditions in model organisms (Eidhof2018GDAP2). This indicates that GDAP2 may play a role in stress adaptation, potentially influencing neuronal differentiation and survival through its activity in the cytoplasm and mitochondria (Eidhof2018GDAP2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GDAP2 gene have been implicated in a new form of cerebellar ataxia, specifically autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia-27 (SCAR27). This condition is characterized by symptoms such as gait imbalance, dysarthria, spasticity, and in some cases, dementia. Biallelic loss-of-function mutations in GDAP2, such as nonsense and frameshift mutations, lead to truncated proteins that likely disrupt the CRAL-TRIO domain, which is crucial for lipid transport and cellular compartment maintenance (Dong2020Novel; Eidhof2018GDAP2).

Research using Drosophila models has shown that loss of GDAP2 function results in decreased survival under stress conditions, suggesting that GDAP2 is a stress-responsive gene. These models exhibited locomotor defects and shortened lifespan, supporting the role of GDAP2 in neurodegenerative processes (Eidhof2018GDAP2).

Clinically, patients with GDAP2 mutations present with cerebellar ataxia, spasticity, and dementia, with neuropathological findings indicating cerebellar and global cerebral atrophy. The mutations are linked to increased susceptibility to oxidative stress and starvation, contributing to the neurodegenerative phenotype observed in affected individuals (Breza2020A; Eidhof2018GDAP2).

## Interactions
GDAP2 (ganglioside induced differentiation associated protein 2) is a protein with domains that suggest potential interactions with lipids and other molecules, although specific protein interactions are not well-documented. The protein contains an N-terminal macro domain and a C-terminal CRAL-TRIO domain, the latter of which has been identified as having a lipid-binding pocket composed mainly of hydrophobic amino acids. This domain is known for binding lipophilic ligands such as tocopherol and phospholipids, indicating a role in lipid-related processes (Chou2024Rapid).

Despite its structural similarities to other macrodomain proteins, GDAP2 does not bind ADP-ribose, a characteristic that distinguishes it from proteins like MacroD1 and MacroD2. This was confirmed through studies using ratiometric FRET signals, which showed no significant binding of GDAP2 to ADP-ribose (Sowa2021A). Additionally, GDAP2 has been noted to have specificity for poly(A) rather than ADP-ribose derivatives, suggesting a unique interaction profile compared to other macrodomain proteins (Rack2016Macrodomains:).

The CRAL-TRIO domain's involvement in lipid binding suggests that GDAP2 may participate in lipid-mediated signaling pathways, although specific interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids have not been detailed in the available literature (Rack2016Macrodomains:).
