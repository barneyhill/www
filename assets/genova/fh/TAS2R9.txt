# TAS2R9

## Overview
TAS2R9 is a gene that encodes the protein taste 2 receptor member 9, which is part of the TAS2R family of bitter taste receptors. These receptors are categorized as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and are primarily involved in the detection of bitter compounds. The TAS2R9 receptor is expressed in human enteroendocrine cells and plays a crucial role in glucose homeostasis by influencing glucose and insulin levels. Variations in the TAS2R9 gene have been linked to metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, highlighting its significance in glucose regulation. The receptor's function is modulated by specific genetic variations, which can alter its response to ligands and affect its role in metabolic processes (Meyerhof2011Molecular; Dotson2008Bitter). Additionally, TAS2R9 has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, where its expression in cancer-associated fibroblasts suggests potential as a therapeutic target (Hung2023A).

## Function
The TAS2R9 gene encodes a bitter taste receptor that is part of the TAS2R family, which are G protein-coupled receptors involved in the perception of bitter compounds. TAS2R9 is expressed in human enteroendocrine cells, where it plays a significant role in glucose homeostasis. This receptor is involved in the regulation of glucose and insulin levels, with variations in the TAS2R9 gene linked to glucose dysregulation and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (Dotson2008Bitter). The receptor's function is influenced by a single amino acid change, from alanine to valine at position 189, which significantly affects its ability to respond to ligands (Dotson2008Bitter).

TAS2R9 is also implicated in the secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), a hormone involved in glucose metabolism. Stimulation of TAS2R9 by certain ligands, such as the drug ofloxacin, can promote GLP-1 secretion, suggesting a mechanism by which this receptor influences glucose homeostasis beyond taste perception (Meyerhof2011Molecular; Dotson2008Bitter). The receptor's activity in enteroendocrine cells highlights its role in nutrient-dependent hormonal responses, potentially affecting metabolic processes and food preferences (Dotson2008Bitter).

## Clinical Significance
The TAS2R9 gene has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to mutations and alterations in its expression. In cancer, TAS2R9 is notably expressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), where its expression is significantly higher compared to normal fibroblasts. This suggests its potential as a therapeutic target in PDAC. TAS2R9 alterations, such as gene amplification, are observed in 1.9% of samples from the TCGA pan-cancer atlas database, with a somatic mutation frequency of 0.5%. Elevated TAS2R9 expression is associated with worse survival in cancers with dense stroma, including breast, ovarian, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (Hung2023A).

In metabolic disorders, TAS2R9 is linked to glucose and insulin homeostasis, particularly in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TAS2R9, such as rs3741845, are associated with dysregulated glucose and insulin homeostasis. This SNP results in an amino acid change that affects the receptor's function, potentially contributing to T2DM (Dotson2008Bitter). The gene's role in glucose regulation is further supported by its expression in enteroendocrine L cells, where it may influence GLP-1 secretion, impacting glucose metabolism (Dotson2008Bitter).

## Interactions
TAS2R9, a bitter taste receptor, is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that interacts with the G protein subunit α-gustducin. This interaction is crucial for the transduction of bitter taste signals. The receptor's activation by specific ligands, such as ofloxacin, pirenzepine, and procainamide, leads to the secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in enteroendocrine cells, a process mediated by α-gustducin (Dotson2008Bitter). This suggests that TAS2R9 is involved in a signaling pathway that regulates glucose homeostasis through its interaction with α-gustducin.

The receptor's function is influenced by genetic variations, such as the rs3741845 SNP, which results in an amino acid change from alanine to valine at position 187. This change affects the receptor's ability to respond to its ligands, indicating that the interaction between TAS2R9 and its ligands is critical for its function (Dotson2008Bitter). While the context does not provide specific information on other protein interactions, the role of TAS2R9 in glucose regulation and its expression in various tissues suggest it may participate in broader metabolic pathways (Dotson2008Bitter).
