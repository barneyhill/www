# FGL1

## Overview
FGL1, or fibrinogen-like 1, is a gene that encodes the protein fibrinogen-like protein 1, which is a member of the fibrinogen superfamily. This protein is primarily secreted by hepatocytes in the liver and is characterized by its fibrinogen-like domain, which facilitates its role as a hepatokine involved in liver regeneration, metabolic regulation, and immune modulation. Unlike traditional fibrinogen proteins, FGL1 lacks coagulation functions but plays a crucial role in immune regulation by interacting with the immune inhibitory receptor LAG-3, thereby influencing T cell activity. This interaction is significant in the context of cancer, where FGL1 is often upregulated, contributing to immune evasion by tumors. Additionally, FGL1 is implicated in metabolic processes, affecting insulin sensitivity and energy balance, and is considered a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in various cancers and metabolic disorders (Wang2019Fibrinogenlike; Chen2024FGL1; Liu2022Implication).

## Structure
Fibrinogen-like protein 1 (FGL1) is a 68-kilodalton protein primarily secreted by hepatocytes in the liver. It is a disulfide bond-linked homodimer, indicating a quaternary structure (Qian2021Fibrinogenlike; Sulimai2022Fibrinogen). The protein contains a fibrinogen-like domain at its C-terminal, which is highly homologous to the β and γ subunits of fibrinogen, although it lacks the platelet binding site, cross-linking region, and thrombin-sensitive site necessary for coagulation (Wang2019Fibrinogenlike; Sulimai2022Fibrinogen). 

FGL1 is composed of a coil-coil domain (CCD) and a fibrinogen-like domain (FD). The FD is responsible for binding to LAG3, an immune inhibitory receptor, while the CCD does not participate in this interaction (Wang2019Fibrinogenlike). The interaction between FGL1 and LAG3 is highly specific and conserved across species, with a high affinity indicated by a Kd value of ~1.5 nM (Wang2019Fibrinogenlike). 

The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, although specific details on these modifications or any splice variant isoforms are not provided in the available context.

## Function
Fibrinogen-like protein 1 (FGL1) is primarily secreted by hepatocytes in the liver and plays a significant role in liver regeneration and repair. It promotes hepatocyte mitosis through an autocrine mechanism, which is crucial for maintaining liver health, particularly following liver injury (Chen2024FGL1; Demchev2013Targeted). FGL1 is involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism and glucose homeostasis, influencing metabolic processes such as insulin resistance and liver lipid metabolism (Chen2024FGL1; Demchev2013Targeted). 

The protein is also implicated in energy substrate utilization, with FGL1 null mice showing increased body weight and altered lipid profiles, indicating its role in metabolic regulation (Demchev2013Targeted). FGL1 acts as a hepatokine, facilitating communication between the liver and other tissues, such as adipose tissue and muscle, affecting insulin sensitivity and energy balance (Qian2021Fibrinogenlike; Liu2022Implication). 

FGL1 is a part of the fibrinogen superfamily but lacks the classic coagulation functions, as it does not possess platelet-binding sites or thrombin-sensitive sites (Liu2022Implication). It is also involved in immune regulation, acting as a functional ligand for the immune inhibitory receptor LAG-3, which may have implications for immune response modulation (Liu2022Implication).

## Clinical Significance
Fibrinogen-like protein 1 (FGL1) is implicated in various diseases due to its role in immune regulation and cancer progression. In cancer, FGL1 is upregulated in several types, including lung, prostate, breast, and colorectal cancers, where it acts as an immune inhibitory ligand of LAG-3, contributing to immune escape and tumor progression (Qian2021Fibrinogenlike; Wang2019Fibrinogenlike). High FGL1 expression is associated with poor prognosis in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), correlating with decreased overall survival and increased tumor metastasis (Wang2019Fibrinogenlike; Lv2021FGL1). In lung adenocarcinoma, FGL1 promotes tumor progression by regulating MYC-target genes and is linked to poor prognosis and drug resistance (Tang2022The).

In liver cancer, FGL1 acts as a tumor suppressor, with lower expression linked to poor differentiation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Liu2022Implication). The gene's expression is also altered in metabolic disorders, where elevated FGL1 levels are associated with obesity-related insulin resistance and adipogenesis (Liu2022Implication). These findings highlight FGL1's potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in various cancers and metabolic conditions.

## Interactions
Fibrinogen-like protein 1 (FGL1) is known to interact with the lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3), a type I transmembrane protein found on activated T cells, NK cells, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. This interaction is characterized by high affinity and specificity, involving the fibrinogen-like domain of FGL1 and the D1-D2 domains of LAG-3. The binding is independent of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, which is another known ligand for LAG-3 (Qian2021Fibrinogenlike; Wang2019Fibrinogenlike). 

FGL1's interaction with LAG-3 plays a significant role in immune regulation by inhibiting T cell activation and proliferation. This interaction is crucial in contexts such as cancer, where FGL1 is upregulated and contributes to immune evasion by tumors. Blocking the FGL1/LAG-3 interaction has been shown to enhance antitumor immunity by promoting the activation and expansion of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (Wang2019Fibrinogenlike; Sulimai2022Fibrinogen). 

FGL1 does not bind to other fibrinogen domain-containing proteins, indicating its specificity for LAG-3. This specificity is further supported by studies using monoclonal antibodies that block FGL1's binding to LAG-3, demonstrating its role as an immune inhibitory ligand (Wang2019Fibrinogenlike).
