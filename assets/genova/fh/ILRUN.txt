# ILRUN

## Overview
The ILRUN gene encodes a protein known as the inflammation and lipid regulator with UBA-like and NBR1-like domains, which plays a critical role in modulating immune responses and lipid metabolism. This protein is characterized by its ubiquitin-associated (UBA)-like domain and neighbor of BRCA1 gene 1 (NBR1)-like domain, which are essential for its function in binding ubiquitinated proteins and mediating protein-protein interactions, respectively. ILRUN acts as an inhibitor of proinflammatory and antimicrobial cytokines, such as type-I interferons and tumor necrosis factor alpha, by promoting the degradation of transcriptional coactivators involved in cytokine transcription. The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the testis, heart, ovary, and adipose tissue, indicating its involvement in immune regulation and metabolic processes. Alterations in ILRUN expression have been linked to several diseases, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia, obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus, underscoring its clinical significance in inflammatory and metabolic disorders (Akhil2023Systemic; Ambrose2020Molecular).

## Structure
The ILRUN protein, encoded by the human ILRUN gene, is a 298 amino acid protein featuring two key domains: a ubiquitin-associated (UBA)-like domain and a neighbor of BRCA1 gene 1 (NBR1)-like domain. The UBA-like domain, located at residues 23-64, is predicted to form a three-helix bundle with a conserved LGF motif, which is involved in ubiquitin binding and may include an additional helix at the N-terminus, forming a non-canonical four-helix structure (Ambrose2020Molecular). The NBR1-like domain, spanning residues 71-180, exhibits a fibronectin type-III topology with seven antiparallel β-strands forming a small β-sandwich. This domain is homologous to the FW domain of NBR1 and contains four conserved tryptophan residues, three of which are buried in the hydrophobic core and one exposed (Ambrose2020Molecular).

The C-terminal region of ILRUN, residues 181-298, is largely unstructured and contains three phosphorylation sites at serine residues 215, 222, and 272 (Ambrose2020Molecular). A shorter isoform, ILRUNb, lacks residues 105-170 of the NBR1 domain, resulting in a 232 amino acid protein (Ambrose2020Molecular). The ILRUN protein is expressed in various human tissues, with the highest levels in the testis and activated B-cells (Ambrose2020Molecular).

## Function
The ILRUN gene encodes a protein that functions as an inhibitor of proinflammatory and antimicrobial cytokines, specifically targeting type-I interferons (IFNα and IFNβ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) (Ambrose2020Molecular). This regulation is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis, preventing excessive inflammatory responses that could lead to autoimmune diseases or cytokine storms (Ambrose2020Molecular). ILRUN achieves this by promoting the degradation of transcriptional coactivators p300 and CBP, which are part of the IFNβ enhanceosome complex, thereby inhibiting IRF3-DNA binding and impairing the transcription of these cytokines (Ambrose2020Molecular).

The protein contains UBA-like and NBR1-like domains, which are essential for its function. The UBA-like domain is involved in binding ubiquitinated proteins, facilitating their degradation, while the NBR1-like domain may mediate dimerization or association with small molecules (Ambrose2020Molecular). ILRUN is highly expressed in tissues such as the testis, heart, ovary, and adipose tissue, suggesting its role in specific cellular processes related to immune regulation and lipid metabolism (Ambrose2020Molecular). The protein's activity in these tissues indicates its involvement in balancing immune responses and metabolic functions, impacting organismal health (Ambrose2020Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
The ILRUN gene is implicated in several diseases due to its role in regulating inflammation and lipid metabolism. Alterations in ILRUN expression are associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), where it regulates interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) signaling, potentially affecting the expansion of CLL clones through chronic immune stimulation (Lin2021Genomewide). High expression of ILRUN in CLL is linked to improved patient survival, suggesting its expression levels may influence disease prognosis (Barrow2020Analysis).

ILRUN is also associated with obesity, as it impacts lipid metabolism. Methylation changes affecting ILRUN expression are linked to body mass index (BMI) and lipid metabolites, contributing to obesity risk (Nikpay2023Genomewide). The gene's expression is correlated with increased malignancy and invasiveness in several cancers, potentially promoting metastasis through the extracellular signal-related kinases (ERK) signaling pathway (Ambrose2020Molecular).

In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), ILRUN expression is significantly lower in patients compared to healthy controls, indicating a potential role in the disease's etiology (Akhil2023Systemic). These associations highlight ILRUN's clinical significance in various inflammatory and metabolic disorders.

## Interactions
The ILRUN protein, previously known as C6orf106, is involved in several interactions that modulate immune responses. It acts as an inhibitor of proinflammatory and antimicrobial cytokines, particularly type-I interferons (IFNs) and TNFα, by targeting transcriptional co-activators CBP/p300 for degradation. This process is facilitated by the UBA-like domain of ILRUN, which binds to ubiquitinated proteins, suggesting a role in directing CBP/p300 to the proteasome for degradation (Ambrose2020Molecular).

ILRUN's NBR1-like domain, characterized by a β-sandwich structure, is implicated in protein-protein interactions, potentially mediating dimerization or association with small molecules (Ambrose2020Molecular). The FW domain of ILRUN, similar to that in NBR1, is involved in interactions with the transcription factor IRF3, although the specific role of the FW domain in this interaction remains unclear (Zhang2022Structural). Deletion of the FW domain disrupts ILRUN's ability to inhibit IRF3 signaling, indicating its importance in protein-protein interactions (Zhang2022Structural).

ILRUN's interactions are crucial for its function in modulating immune responses, particularly through its effects on cytokine transcription and its involvement in ubiquitin-related processes (Ambrose2020Molecular).
