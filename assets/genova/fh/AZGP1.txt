# AZGP1

## Overview
AZGP1, or alpha-2-glycoprotein 1, zinc-binding, is a gene that encodes a soluble protein involved in various physiological processes, including lipid metabolism and immune modulation. The protein, often referred to as zinc-α2-glycoprotein (ZAG), is characterized by a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-like fold, which allows it to bind small hydrophobic ligands rather than antigenic peptides. ZAG is predominantly expressed in the liver, adipose tissue, and secretory epithelial cells, and is present in most body fluids, where it functions as an adipokine influencing lipid degradation and energy homeostasis (Bing2004Zincα2glycoprotein; Falvella2007AZGP1). The protein's ability to stimulate lipolysis and promote the browning of white adipose tissue underscores its role in energy expenditure and thermogenesis (Elattar2018The). Additionally, AZGP1 has been implicated in cancer biology, where its expression levels can influence tumor progression and serve as a prognostic marker in various cancers, including prostate and gastric cancer (Huang2013Decreased; Burdelski2015Reduced).

## Structure
The AZGP1 gene encodes the zinc-α2-glycoprotein (ZAG), which is characterized by a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-like protein fold. The protein structure includes a groove between the α1 and α2 domain helices, similar to MHC molecules, but it is soluble and binds small hydrophobic ligands rather than antigenic peptides (Kumar2013Strong). The α1-α2 groove is involved in binding small hydrophobic molecules, while the α3 domain forms tetrameric structures that enhance ZAG's binding capacity (Lau2019Crystal). 

ZAG contains a tightly-bound zinc ion near its groove and approximately 15 weak zinc binding sites on its surface, which are specific to zinc and can induce oligomerization, forming dimers and trimers (Zahid2015Zincinduced). The protein's secondary structure includes β-sheets, coils, and turns, with a-helices remaining stable during molecular dynamics simulations (Kumar2013Strong). 

Post-translational modifications include glycosylation at specific sites, such as Asn-239 in the α3 domain, which may influence the protein's structural or functional roles (Lau2019Crystal). The presence of glycosylation can affect the binding sites and overall structure of ZAG (Delker2004Crystallographic).

## Function
AZGP1, also known as alpha-2-glycoprotein 1, zinc-binding, is a protein involved in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. It stimulates lipolysis, the breakdown of fats into free fatty acids and glycerol, by activating hormone-sensitive lipase through increased intracellular cAMP levels. This process is mediated via the β3 adrenoreceptor, leading to the mobilization of stored lipids and increased serum-free fatty acid levels (Bing2004Zincα2glycoprotein; Tisdale2009Zincα2glycoprotein).

AZGP1 is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, adipose tissue, and secretory epithelial cells, and is found in most body fluids (Falvella2007AZGP1). In adipose tissue, AZGP1 acts as an adipokine, influencing the local regulation of adipose tissue function by promoting lipid degradation in adipocytes (Falvella2007AZGP1). It also plays a role in the browning of white adipose tissue, enhancing energy expenditure and thermogenesis by up-regulating thermogenic genes and promoting the differentiation of white adipocyte progenitors into brown-like cells (Elattar2018The).

In healthy human cells, AZGP1 is involved in maintaining energy balance and modulating immune responses, although its specific functions in these processes are not fully elucidated (Fang2022AZGP1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the AZGP1 gene have been linked to various cancers, impacting prognosis and disease progression. In gastric cancer, decreased AZGP1 expression is associated with poor prognosis, correlating with more aggressive tumor characteristics such as poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas and advanced T stage. High AZGP1 expression is linked to better overall and 5-year survival rates, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Huang2013Decreased).

In prostate cancer, reduced AZGP1 expression is an independent predictor of early PSA recurrence and is associated with ERG-fusion positive and PTEN-deleted cancers. This reduction is linked to adverse outcomes, including high Gleason scores and advanced tumor stages. AZGP1 expression levels are also associated with specific molecular subgroups of prostate cancer, influencing prognosis and treatment strategies (Burdelski2015Reduced).

In intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, low AZGP1 expression correlates with poor prognosis and shorter life expectancy. AZGP1 is suggested to act as a tumor suppressor, with its activation by lenvatinib inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition through the TGF-β1/Smad3 pathway (Deng2023AZGP1). In hepatocellular carcinoma, AZGP1 suppresses tumor progression by inhibiting cell growth, migration, invasion, and metastasis, highlighting its role as a potential therapeutic target (Tian2016Downregulation).

## Interactions
AZGP1, also known as alpha-2-glycoprotein 1, zinc-binding, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In colorectal cancer, AZGP1 interacts with the actin-binding protein filamin A (FLNA). This interaction is crucial for promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a key process in cancer metastasis. AZGP1 binds to FLNA, preventing its proteolysis and nuclear translocation, which is associated with reduced metastatic potential. The interaction with FLNA is mediated by the kinase PAK2, which phosphorylates FLNA, maintaining its stability and promoting metastasis (Ji2019Zincα2glycoprotein).

In hepatic cancer, AZGP1 interacts with the TGF-β1-ERK2 signaling pathway. It inhibits the phosphorylation of ERK2, thereby blocking TGF-β1-induced EMT and invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. This suggests that AZGP1 interferes with the crosstalk between TGF-β1 and Ras/ERK signaling, influencing EMT and cell invasiveness (Xu2016AZGP1).

AZGP1 also has potential roles in immunoregulation and cell adhesion. It contains an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence in its a3 domain, facilitating cell adhesion through interactions with integrins, similar to fibronectin (Hassan2008Zinc).
