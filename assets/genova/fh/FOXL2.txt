# FOXL2

## Overview
FOXL2 is a gene that encodes the forkhead box L2 protein, a transcription factor belonging to the forkhead family, characterized by a conserved forkhead domain. This protein plays a pivotal role in ovarian development and function, particularly in the differentiation and maintenance of granulosa cells, which are essential for oocyte maturation and folliculogenesis (Georges2014The; Tucker2021The). The FOXL2 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis, through its interactions with other proteins and its ability to modulate gene expression (Jin2020FOXL2; Tucker2021The). Mutations in the FOXL2 gene are linked to clinical conditions such as Blepharophimosis-Ptosis-Epicanthus Inversus Syndrome (BPES) and adult-type ovarian granulosa cell tumors, highlighting its significance in both developmental and pathological contexts (Takahashi2013The; Caburet2004A).

## Structure
The FOXL2 protein is a transcription factor characterized by a conserved forkhead domain, also known as a winged helix domain, which is approximately 100-110 amino acids in length. This domain is crucial for DNA binding and consists of three alpha helices, three beta sheets, and two 'wing' regions, enabling monomeric DNA binding (Moumné2008The; Tucker2021The). The forkhead domain is highly conserved across vertebrate species, indicating its essential role in the protein's function (Cocquet2003Structure).

The FOXL2 protein also contains a polyalanine tract, which is conserved in mammals and consists of 14 alanine residues. Expansions of this tract to 24 alanines are associated with Blepharophimosis Ptosis Epicanthus inversus Syndrome (BPES) type II (Cocquet2003Structure; Caburet2004A). The protein is a single-exon gene and is not subject to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, which affects its expression levels (Moumné2008The).

Post-translational modifications of FOXL2 include phosphorylation, sulfation, acetylation, and SUMOylation. These modifications are crucial for its stability and function, influencing its activity and localization within the cell (Georges2011SUMOylation). The presence of a nuclear localization signal within the forkhead domain ensures its localization to the nucleus, where it functions as a transcription factor (Moumné2008The).

## Function
FOXL2 is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in ovarian development and function. It is involved in promoting female sex determination by repressing male pathways, such as the suppression of the SOX9 gene, which is essential for testis development (Georges2014The; Tucker2021The). FOXL2 is crucial for the differentiation and maintenance of ovarian granulosa cells, which support oocyte maturation and growth during folliculogenesis (Georges2014The). It regulates the expression of genes involved in estrogen signaling, such as Cyp19a1, which encodes the aromatase enzyme responsible for estradiol production (Georges2014The).

FOXL2 also plays a role in maintaining genomic stability by regulating DNA double-strand break repair mechanisms, balancing homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining (Tucker2021The). It influences cell cycle progression and apoptosis, impacting proteins like cyclin D1 and BID (Tucker2021The). In the nucleus, FOXL2 binds to DNA to modulate gene expression, ensuring the proper function and identity of granulosa cells by repressing testis-specific genes and activating ovarian-specific genes (Georges2014The; Baere2010The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FOXL2 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. One of the primary disorders linked to FOXL2 mutations is Blepharophimosis-Ptosis-Epicanthus Inversus Syndrome (BPES), an autosomal dominant condition characterized by eyelid malformations. BPES is divided into two types: Type I, which includes premature ovarian failure (POF), and Type II, which does not involve ovarian dysfunction. Mutations in the FOXL2 gene, particularly those leading to polyalanine expansions, are common in BPES and can result in protein mislocalization and aggregation, affecting its function (Caburet2004A; Méjécase2021The; Verdin2012<i>FOXL2).

FOXL2 is also implicated in adult-type ovarian granulosa cell tumors (AGCTs), where a specific somatic mutation, c.402C>G (p.C134W), is found in a high percentage of cases. This mutation is associated with faster cell cycling and reduced apoptosis, contributing to tumor development (Takahashi2013The; Verdin2012<i>FOXL2). The mutation's presence in AGCTs highlights FOXL2's role as a potential tumor suppressor or oncogene (Tucker2021The). Despite the association with BPES, germline FOXL2 mutations do not typically lead to granulosa cell tumors, suggesting different pathogenic mechanisms (McTavish2013Granulosa).

## Interactions
FOXL2 is a transcription factor that engages in various protein-protein interactions, influencing its role in cellular processes such as apoptosis, DNA repair, and transcription regulation. It interacts with SIRT1, a deacetylase that represses FOXL2's pro-apoptotic activity (L’Hôte2012Discovery). FOXL2 also binds with CREM-t2a, which can either activate or inhibit transcription depending on the promoter context, affecting genes like CYP19A1 and PTGS2 (L’Hôte2012Discovery). Interaction with BANF1 results in a mild inhibition of FOXL2's transactivation capacity and abrogation of its pro-apoptotic function (L’Hôte2012Discovery).

FOXL2 is involved in DNA double-strand break repair pathways through interactions with the Ku complex proteins XRCC5 and XRCC6. The acetylation status of FOXL2 at lysine 124 is crucial for these interactions, influencing the choice between non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) repair pathways (Jin2020FOXL2). FOXL2 competes with XRCC5 for binding to XRCC6, regulating the formation of the Ku complex (Jin2020FOXL2).

In ovarian cells, FOXL2 interacts with Steroidogenic Factor-1 (SF-1), suppressing SF-1-induced transcription of the CYP17 gene, a process disrupted by certain FOXL2 mutations (Park2010FOXL2). These interactions highlight FOXL2's multifaceted role in cellular regulation and its potential implications in disease.
