# LMF1

## Overview
Lipase maturation factor 1 (LMF1) is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which plays a pivotal role in lipid metabolism by facilitating the maturation and activation of lipases within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of human cells. The LMF1 protein is categorized as an ER-resident chaperone, essential for the proper folding and assembly of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic lipase (HL), which are crucial for lipid homeostasis (Neher2019Lipase; Wu2021Lipoprotein). Structurally, LMF1 is characterized by multiple transmembrane domains and a conserved C-terminal domain, which are vital for its function in lipase maturation (Wu2021Lipoprotein; Guo2022A). Mutations in the LMF1 gene can lead to severe hypertriglyceridemia, underscoring its importance in normal lipid metabolism and its potential clinical significance in lipid disorders (Ehrhardt2014Embryonic; Serveaux2018New).

## Structure
The LMF1 protein is encoded by the human LMF1 gene and consists of 567 amino acids. It is predicted to contain five transmembrane domains and a conserved C-terminal LMF1 domain, which are crucial for its function in lipase maturation (Wu2021Lipoprotein; Guo2022A). The protein's tertiary structure is affected by mutations, such as the c.1523C > T mutation, which alters a helix into a coil, impacting its stability and turnover (Guo2022A). 

LMF1 acts as an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident chaperone, essential for the folding and dimerization of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic lipase (HL) (Serveaux2020Involvement; Wu2021Lipoprotein). The protein's role in stabilizing LPL in the ER may involve promoting dimerization or interacting with ER-resident chaperones to facilitate disulfide bond formation (Wu2021Lipoprotein). 

In Toxoplasma gondii, LMF1 is localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane and interacts with various proteins, suggesting its involvement in mitochondrial morphology and dynamics, although these findings may not directly apply to the human protein (Souza2022IMC10).

## Function
Lipase maturation factor 1 (LMF1) is a crucial protein involved in the maturation and activation of lipases, particularly lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic lipase (HL), within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of healthy human cells. LMF1 functions as an ER-resident chaperone, facilitating the proper folding and assembly of these lipases, which are essential for lipid metabolism (Neher2019Lipase; Wu2021Lipoprotein). The protein is involved in post-translational modifications, such as N-glycosylation and disulfide bond formation, which are necessary for the enzymatic activity of LPL and HL (Wu2021Lipoprotein).

LMF1 plays a role in maintaining ER redox homeostasis by enabling the formation of LPL's disulfide bonds, preventing aggregation due to incorrect intermolecular disulfide bonds (Neher2019Lipase). This process ensures that lipases can exit the ER and function effectively in lipid metabolism, contributing to lipid homeostasis and energy balance in the organism (Wu2021Lipoprotein). Deficiency in LMF1 can lead to the accumulation of inactive lipases in the ER, resulting in severe hypertriglyceridemia, highlighting its importance in normal lipid metabolism (Wu2021Lipoprotein).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LMF1 gene are associated with severe hypertriglyceridemia (HTG), a condition characterized by elevated triglyceride levels in the blood, which can lead to acute pancreatitis and cardiovascular diseases. LMF1 is crucial for the maturation of lipases, including lipoprotein lipase (LPL), hepatic lipase (HL), and endothelial lipase (EL). Mutations in LMF1 can impair lipase activity, leading to lipase deficiency and severe HTG (Ehrhardt2014Embryonic; Serveaux2018New).

Several studies have identified rare genetic variants of LMF1 in patients with severe HTG. For instance, a heterozygous missense mutation in LMF1, combined with a mutation in the LPL gene, was found to significantly reduce LPL levels, exacerbating HTG symptoms (Guo2022A). Another study identified a homozygous exon 6 deletion in LMF1, which was associated with intermittent severe HTG and a multifactorial chylomicronemia syndrome (Serveaux2020Involvement).

In a mouse model, complete LMF1 deficiency resulted in severe hypertriglyceridemia and neonatal lethality, underscoring the gene's critical role in lipid metabolism (Ehrhardt2014Embryonic). These findings highlight the clinical significance of LMF1 mutations in lipid disorders.

## Interactions
Lipase maturation factor 1 (LMF1) is involved in the maturation and activation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic lipase (HL) by facilitating their proper folding and function within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). LMF1 is an ER-resident protein that may stabilize LPL by promoting its dimerization or by interacting with ER-resident chaperones such as ERp72, ERp44, ERdj5, and thioredoxin to facilitate disulfide bond formation (Wu2021Lipoprotein). The importance of LMF1 in LPL maturation is underscored by the severe hypertriglyceridemia observed in mice with a global deficiency in LMF1, which results in the accumulation of inactive LPL and hepatic lipase in the ER (Wu2021Lipoprotein).

In Toxoplasma gondii, LMF1 has been identified as a Fis1 interactor, crucial for maintaining mitochondrial morphology. It localizes to the outer mitochondrial membrane through protein-protein interactions, despite lacking typical localization signals. LMF1 knockout results in abnormal mitochondrial morphologies, indicating its role in maintaining the typical lasso shape of mitochondria in intracellular parasites. This suggests that LMF1 interacts with Fis1 and other proteins to maintain membrane contact sites important for mitochondrial positioning and morphology (Jacobs2020Identification).
