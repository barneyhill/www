# NOX3

## Overview
NOX3 is a gene that encodes the protein NADPH oxidase 3, a member of the NADPH oxidase family, which is primarily involved in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This protein is categorized as a transmembrane enzyme and is predominantly expressed in the inner ear, where it plays a critical role in the formation of otoconia, structures necessary for balance and spatial orientation (Katsuyama2011Physiological; Brandes2014Nox). NOX3 forms a complex with the membrane subunit p22phox, which is essential for its structural maturation and function (Leto2009Targeting; Nakano2007Critical). While NOX3 exhibits some basal activity, its function can be modulated by interactions with various cytosolic proteins and cofactors, such as NOXO1 and Rac1, although the latter's influence is less pronounced compared to other Nox enzymes (Ueyama2006Involvement; Brandes2014Nox). The gene's clinical significance is highlighted by its association with vestibular defects and hearing loss, particularly in response to ototoxic drugs and noise exposure (Paffenholz2004Vestibular; Elbatreek2020NOX).

## Structure
NOX3 is a member of the NADPH oxidase family, characterized by a conserved structure that includes a NADPH-binding site at the C-terminus and a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-binding region near the C-terminal transmembrane domain. It contains six conserved transmembrane domains and four heme-binding histidines, which are essential for its function in electron transport and reactive oxygen species production (Panday2014NADPH). The protein is suggested to have a bis-heme motif, where two heme groups are ligated to the protein backbone by histidine residues, a feature common to several membrane cytochromes (Nakano2007Critical).

NOX3 forms a heterodimeric complex with the membrane subunit p22phox, which is crucial for its structural maturation, stability, and plasma membrane targeting (Leto2009Targeting; Nakano2007Critical). This interaction is necessary for the proper glycosylation and function of NOX3, as p22phox enhances its glycosylation and membrane localization (Nakano2007Critical). The protein's activity is also dependent on the acquisition of heme, as inhibiting heme biosynthesis significantly reduces its superoxide production (Nakano2007Critical). NOX3's structure and function are closely related to other NOX family members, particularly NOX2, sharing 56% amino acid identity (Panday2014NADPH).

## Function
NOX3 (NADPH oxidase 3) is an enzyme primarily expressed in the inner ear, where it plays a crucial role in the formation of otoconia, structures essential for balance and spatial orientation (Katsuyama2011Physiological; Brandes2014Nox). The enzyme functions as part of a multicomponent system, similar to other members of the Nox family, and is involved in generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) by transferring electrons from NADPH to oxygen (Leto2009Targeting). 

NOX3 activity is regulated by interactions with various cytosolic proteins and cofactors, including p22phox, which is necessary for its maturation and stabilization (Leto2009Targeting; Brandes2014Nox). Although NOX3 exhibits some basal activity without cytosolic subunits, its activity can be enhanced by factors such as Noxo1 and Rac1, although the latter's influence is less pronounced compared to other Nox enzymes (Ueyama2006Involvement; Brandes2014Nox). 

In healthy human cells, NOX3's primary function is linked to its role in the inner ear, contributing to the perception of gravity and balance through the development of otoconial structures (Leto2009Targeting; Ueyama2006Involvement).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NOX3 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting the inner ear. Mutations in NOX3 can lead to vestibular defects due to the absence of otoconia, which are essential for balance and spatial orientation. This results in a phenotype characterized by a tilted head position and poor motor coordination, as observed in head-tilt mice (Paffenholz2004Vestibular). These mutations include nonsense and missense mutations that disrupt the NADPH binding site, leading to a loss of function (Paffenholz2004Vestibular).

NOX3 is also implicated in hearing loss, particularly in response to ototoxic drugs like cisplatin. The enzyme's role in generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) contributes to cochlear damage and apoptosis, which can be mitigated by NOX3 knockdown (Katsuyama2011Physiological; Bánfi2004NOX3). Increased NOX3 expression is linked to noise-induced hearing loss, as it leads to cochlear inflammation and apoptosis (Elbatreek2020NOX).

Beyond the inner ear, NOX3 has been associated with insulin resistance. In db/db mice, elevated NOX3 expression in the liver correlates with increased ROS production, contributing to lipid accumulation and insulin resistance (Katsuyama2011Physiological).

## Interactions
NOX3 (NADPH oxidase 3) is involved in generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and interacts with several proteins to form a functional enzyme complex. A key interaction is with p22phox, a small transmembrane protein that is crucial for the maturation, stabilization, and correct trafficking of NOX3. This interaction provides a binding platform for cytosolic activator proteins, facilitating the activation of NOX3 (Rastogi2017NOX; Brandes2014Nox).

NOX3 activity is also modulated by interactions with cytosolic subunits such as NOXA1 and NOXO1. NOXA1 can enhance NOX3 activity, although it may inhibit activity when supported by NOXO1, depending on the specific interactions and mutations present (Ueyama2006Involvement). NOXO1 can activate human NOX3 even in the absence of NOXA1 or p67phox, with different isoforms of NOXO1 showing varying levels of activity (Brandes2014Nox).

The role of Rac1, a small GTPase, in NOX3 activation is debated. Some studies suggest that Rac1 enhances NOX3 activity when co-expressed with certain cofactors, while others indicate that Rac1 does not influence NOX3 activity (Ueyama2006Involvement; Brandes2014Nox). Despite the presence of a Rac binding site, functional studies have not consistently demonstrated Rac-dependent activation of NOX3 (Brandes2014Nox).
