# IFIT1

## Overview
The IFIT1 gene encodes the interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1, a key player in the innate immune response, particularly in antiviral defense. This protein is characterized by its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and contribute to its structural integrity. IFIT1 is primarily involved in inhibiting viral replication by binding to viral mRNA, thereby preventing its translation. It achieves this by recognizing and binding to the 5′-end of viral mRNAs that lack 2'-O-methylation, a modification present in host mRNAs, thus distinguishing between self and nonself RNA. The protein forms complexes with other IFIT family members, enhancing its antiviral efficacy. Beyond its role in immune defense, IFIT1 is implicated in various cancers, where its altered expression can influence tumor progression and metastasis, making it a potential biomarker for prognosis and therapeutic targeting (Fensterl2015InterferonInduced; Abbas2017Structure; Pidugu2019Emerging).

## Structure
The IFIT1 protein is characterized by its multiple tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which are 34 amino acid sequences that form helix-turn-helix structures. These motifs facilitate protein-protein interactions and contribute to the protein's secondary and tertiary structures (Fensterl2015InterferonInduced; Pidugu2019Emerging). The tertiary structure of IFIT1 is monomeric and clamp-shaped, featuring a positively charged pocket that binds RNA, particularly viral mRNA 5'-ends lacking 2'-O-methylation (Fensterl2015InterferonInduced; Abbas2017Structure). 

The protein's quaternary structure involves the potential formation of complexes with other IFIT proteins, although IFIT1 primarily complexes with Ifit1c (Fensterl2015InterferonInduced). IFIT1 can also form homo-oligomers and interact with other IFIT family members, except IFIT5, to form protein complexes in cells (Pidugu2019Emerging). 

Structurally, IFIT1 contains a central RNA-binding tunnel, approximately 30-40 Å in length and 12-19 Å in width, which accommodates single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) with a total of five nucleotides (Abbas2017Structure). The tunnel is divided into regions for cap-binding and sensing 2'-O methylation, crucial for distinguishing self from nonself mRNA (Abbas2017Structure).

## Function
IFIT1 (interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1) is a crucial component of the innate immune response, primarily involved in antiviral defense mechanisms. In healthy human cells, IFIT1 is typically expressed at low levels but is significantly upregulated in response to viral infections and interferon signaling (Fensterl2015InterferonInduced). The protein functions by selectively inhibiting the translation of viral mRNA, thereby preventing viral replication. It achieves this by binding to the 5′-end of viral mRNAs, which are often capped to mimic host mRNA, and blocking their translation (Abbas2017Structure). IFIT1 competes with the translation initiation factor eIF4F, specifically recognizing foreign capped mRNAs while remaining inactive against host mRNAs that are marked by ribose 2′-O methylation at the first cap-proximal nucleotide (N1), a molecular signature of 'self' (Abbas2017Structure).

Structurally, IFIT1 forms a positively charged RNA-binding tunnel that engages the cap in multiple conformations, allowing it to differentiate between self and nonself mRNA (Abbas2017Structure). This selective recognition mechanism helps IFIT1 impede viral replication by binding the 5′ end of viral RNA, leading to translational inhibition (Abbas2017Structure). IFIT1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with viral and cellular RNAs and proteins to exert its antiviral effects (Fensterl2015InterferonInduced).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the IFIT1 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In OSCC, overexpression of IFIT1, along with IFIT3, enhances cell invasion and metastasis by promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and increasing the activation of EGFR and AKT pathways. This overexpression is associated with advanced cancer stages, lymph node metastasis, and poor survival rates, suggesting that IFIT1 could serve as a prognostic biomarker and influence the effectiveness of EGFR-targeted therapies like gefitinib (Pidugu2019IFIT1).

In HCC, IFIT1 expression is significantly increased in metastatic tissues. Silencing IFIT1 in HCC cell lines reduces cell migration and the expression of proteins associated with cell aggressiveness, indicating its role in cancer progression and metastasis (Liu2021Cancerassociated).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), IFIT1 is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis, shorter overall survival, and drug resistance. Its expression is correlated with immune cell infiltration, potentially affecting prognosis through immune modulation (Zhao2023The).

## Interactions
The human IFIT1 protein is involved in various interactions with both proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in antiviral defense. IFIT1 forms a multi-protein complex with IFIT2 and IFIT3, facilitated by a conserved YxxxL motif in the C-terminus, with IFIT3 acting as a central scaffold (Pidugu2019Emerging). This complex formation is crucial for enhancing antiviral responses. IFIT1 also interacts with viral RNA, particularly recognizing non-self, capped viral mRNAs and uncapped 5′ triphosphate RNA (PPP-RNA), which helps inhibit viral replication by competing with the eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) for binding to the m7Gppp-cap (Abbas2017A; Abbas2013Structural).

In addition to its interactions with viral RNA, IFIT1 has been shown to physically interact with the eukaryotic elongation factor-1a (eEF1A). This interaction is mediated through the 174-328 amino acids region of IFIT1, which contains TPR motifs 4-7 (Li2009The). The association between IFIT1 and eEF1A suggests a potential regulatory mechanism in cellular processes influenced by interferon signaling (Li2009The). These interactions highlight IFIT1's role in modulating immune responses and inhibiting viral propagation.
