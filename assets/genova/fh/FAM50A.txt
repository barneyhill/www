# FAM50A

## Overview
The FAM50A gene encodes a protein known as family with sequence similarity 50 member A, which is ubiquitously expressed and primarily localized in the nucleus. This protein is involved in critical cellular processes, including RNA processing and transcription regulation, particularly through its interactions with components of the spliceosome, such as the U5 and C-complex proteins. FAM50A plays a significant role in mRNA splicing, which is essential for normal neuronal proliferation, differentiation, and craniofacial development. Mutations in the FAM50A gene are linked to Armfield X-linked intellectual disability syndrome, a condition characterized by intellectual disability and developmental delays, highlighting the gene's importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and development (Haghshenas2021Detection; Lee2020Mutations).

## Function
The FAM50A gene encodes a protein that is ubiquitously expressed and primarily localized in the nucleus, where it plays a significant role in RNA processing and transcription regulation. FAM50A is involved in mRNA splicing, interacting with components of the spliceosome, specifically the U5 and C-complex proteins, which are crucial for proper mRNA splicing during development (Lee2020Mutations). The protein's interaction with spliceosome components suggests its involvement in RNA processing, and co-immunoprecipitation assays have confirmed its physical interaction with spliceosome effectors (Lee2020Mutations).

In healthy cells, FAM50A is implicated in maintaining normal cellular gene expression programs and preventing apoptosis and cell death. Its role in mRNA splicing and processing is essential for normal neuronal proliferation and differentiation, as well as proper craniofacial development (Lee2020Mutations). The gene's function is also linked to the regulation of apoptosis, as evidenced by the upregulation of tp53 and its downstream target mdm2 in FAM50A knockout models (Lee2020Mutations). These molecular activities highlight the importance of FAM50A in cellular homeostasis and development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FAM50A gene are associated with Armfield X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) syndrome, a condition characterized by intellectual disability, developmental delays, and various physical abnormalities. This syndrome is considered a spliceosomopathy, as FAM50A mutations disrupt normal mRNA processing during development, affecting the spliceosome C complex (Lee2020Mutations). Clinical features of Armfield XLID syndrome include global developmental delay, seizures, short stature, craniofacial anomalies, and ocular abnormalities such as glaucoma (Haghshenas2021Detection; Lee2020Mutations).

Research has identified several pathogenic missense variants in FAM50A, such as c.764A>G (p.Asp255Gly) and c.761A>G (p.Glu254Gly), which are linked to the disease phenotype (Haghshenas2021Detection; Lee2020Mutations). These mutations are located in conserved regions of the gene and are predicted to affect protein stability and function (Lee2020Mutations). Studies using zebrafish models have demonstrated that FAM50A mutations lead to defects in neurogenesis and craniofacial development, mirroring the human condition (Lee2020Mutations). The identification of a specific DNA methylation signature associated with FAM50A mutations further supports its role in diagnosing and understanding the molecular mechanisms of Armfield XLID syndrome (Haghshenas2021Detection).

## Interactions
The FAM50A protein is known to interact with components of the spliceosome, particularly the U5 and C-complex proteins. This interaction was demonstrated through a FAM50A pulldown assay followed by mass spectrometry, which identified 99 interactors, with a significant focus on RNA processing proteins. Notably, FAM50A was shown to physically interact with EFTUD2 and DDX41, which are part of the U5 and C-complex, respectively. These interactions were validated using co-immunoprecipitation assays in U-87 glioblastoma cells, confirming the presence of FAM50A and its partners through immunoblotting (Lee2020Mutations).

FAM50A is also implicated in the spliceosome C-complex, involved in mRNA splicing. In fam50a knockout zebrafish, gene set enrichment analysis revealed upregulation of genes involved in mRNA splicing, and altered splice junctions were observed, particularly at 3′ splice sites. These findings suggest that FAM50A plays a role in spliceosome C-complex impairment, although its specific role and recruitment process remain unclear (Lee2020Mutations).

Additionally, FAM50A has been identified as a moderately abundant protein in the C complex, suggesting its association with this complex, although specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids were not detailed (Agafonov2011Semiquantitative).
