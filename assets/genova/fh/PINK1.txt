# PINK1

## Overview
PINK1 (PTEN induced kinase 1) is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial serine/threonine-protein kinase, which plays a pivotal role in mitochondrial quality control and cellular homeostasis. The protein product of PINK1 is involved in the identification and removal of damaged mitochondria through a process known as mitophagy, thereby maintaining cellular energy balance and preventing the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria. Upon mitochondrial damage, PINK1 accumulates on the outer mitochondrial membrane and recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin, facilitating the autophagic elimination of impaired mitochondria. This kinase activity is crucial for neuroprotection and cellular homeostasis, as it phosphorylates ubiquitin and other substrates, enhancing Parkin's recruitment and activation. Mutations in the PINK1 gene are associated with early-onset Parkinson's disease, highlighting its clinical significance in neurodegenerative disorders (Sekine2018PINK1; Narendra2010PINK1; Vizziello2021Disruption).

## Structure
PINK1 (PTEN induced kinase 1) is a 581-amino acid protein with a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct regions. The primary structure features an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS), a putative transmembrane helix, an N-terminal linker region, a serine/threonine kinase domain, and a C-terminal extension (CTE) (Rasool2018New; Trempe2013Structure). The kinase domain is characterized by a bilobular structure with an N-lobe and C-lobe, containing an activation loop for magnesium ion coordination, a catalytic loop with an aspartate for phosphoryl transfer, a regulatory aC-helix, and a P-loop for ATP binding (Rasool2018New).

The secondary structure of PINK1 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, with the C-lobe maintaining a largely alpha-helical architecture (Rasool2018New). The tertiary structure involves a folded kinase domain similar to the calmodulin-dependent kinase family, featuring N-and C-terminal lobes with a catalytic and ATP:Mg2+ binding site in the cleft between them (Trempe2013Structure). Unique to PINK1 are three loop insertions in the N-terminal lobe, which contain Parkinson's disease mutations (Trempe2013Structure).

PINK1 undergoes post-translational modifications, notably autophosphorylation at specific serine residues, which are crucial for its activation and function (Rasool2018New). The protein also has splice variant isoforms, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
PINK1 (PTEN induced kinase 1) is a mitochondrial serine/threonine-protein kinase that plays a critical role in maintaining mitochondrial quality control. In healthy human cells, PINK1 is involved in identifying and initiating the degradation of damaged mitochondria through a process known as mitophagy. Upon mitochondrial damage, PINK1 accumulates on the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin from the cytosol. This recruitment is essential for the autophagic elimination of impaired mitochondria, thereby maintaining cellular energy balance and preventing the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria (Sekine2018PINK1; Narendra2010PINK1).

PINK1's kinase activity is crucial for its function, as it phosphorylates ubiquitin and other substrates on the OMM, which enhances Parkin's recruitment and activation. This phosphorylation creates a positive feedback loop that amplifies the signal of mitochondrial damage, facilitating the clearance of defective mitochondria (Sekine2018PINK1). PINK1 also interacts with mitochondrial chaperones like TRAP1, phosphorylating them to protect cells against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis by inhibiting cytochrome c release, a key step in the apoptotic pathway (Pridgeon2007PINK1). Through these mechanisms, PINK1 plays a vital role in cellular homeostasis and neuroprotection.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PINK1 gene are significantly associated with early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD), particularly in its autosomal recessive form. These mutations can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, a key factor in the pathogenesis of PD, by impairing the PINK1-Parkin pathway involved in mitophagy, which is essential for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis in neurons (Vizziello2021Disruption). PINK1 mutations result in decreased Complex I activity, leading to deficient synaptic function and increased susceptibility to cellular stress, contributing to neuronal degeneration (Morais2009Parkinson’s).

Homozygous mutations in PINK1, such as truncating nonsense and missense mutations, have been identified in consanguineous families with early-onset PD, suggesting a hereditary component (Valente2004Hereditary). Heterozygous mutations in PINK1 have also been implicated as a risk factor for later-onset PD, with studies showing an enrichment of these mutations in PD patients compared to controls (Abou‐Sleiman2006A).

The clinical presentation of PINK1-related parkinsonism often resembles late-onset PD, with a slow progression and good response to L-dopa treatment (Valente2004PINK1). The presence of PINK1 mutations in both familial and sporadic cases highlights their significant role in the genetic etiology of Parkinson's disease (Nuytemans2010Genetic).

## Interactions
PINK1 (PTEN induced kinase 1) is involved in several critical protein interactions that play a role in mitochondrial quality control and autophagy. PINK1 interacts with Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, to mediate mitophagy, the selective autophagy of damaged mitochondria. This interaction is essential for maintaining mitochondrial morphology and function, particularly through processes like fission and fusion (Salazar2018The). PINK1 phosphorylates Parkin, facilitating its recruitment to the mitochondrial membrane, which is crucial for the ubiquitination and degradation of damaged mitochondria (Salazar2018The).

PINK1 also interacts with Beclin1, a pro-autophagic protein, to enhance autophagy. This interaction requires the full-length PINK1 protein and is independent of its kinase activity. The interaction is significant for promoting both basal and starvation-induced autophagy, which is reduced when Beclin1 expression is knocked down (Michiorri2010The).

Additionally, PINK1 forms complexes with other proteins such as DJ-1 and HtrA2/Omi, contributing to mitochondrial homeostasis and response to oxidative stress (Salazar2018The; Sim2012Analysis). These interactions highlight PINK1's role in neuroprotective pathways and its potential implications in neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease.
