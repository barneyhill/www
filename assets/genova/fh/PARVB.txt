# PARVB

## Overview
PARVB is a gene that encodes the protein parvin beta, which is a member of the parvin family of cytoskeletal proteins. Parvin beta is characterized by its tandem calponin homology (CH) domains, which are integral to its function in cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization (Mongroo2004βparvin). As an adaptor protein, parvin beta plays a crucial role in integrin-mediated signaling pathways, particularly through its interactions with integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and paxillin, contributing to the regulation of cell spreading, adhesion, and signal transduction (Stiegler2012Structural; Rosenberger2003Interaction). The protein is involved in the formation of the PINCH-ILK-parvin (PIP) complex, which is essential for cell-extracellular matrix interactions and maintaining cellular structure (Wu2004The). Parvin beta's regulatory functions in these pathways are significant for normal cellular processes and have implications in cancer progression, where its expression levels can influence tumor behavior and patient prognosis (Kimura2010Functional; Yu2021Construction).

## Structure
PARVB (parvin beta) is a protein characterized by its tandem calponin homology (CH) domains, specifically CH1 and CH2, which are crucial for its interactions with other proteins and its role in cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization (Mongroo2004βparvin). The CH2 domain of β-parvin is particularly important for binding to paxillin and integrin-linked kinase (ILK), facilitating its localization to focal adhesions (Stiegler2012Structural). The CH2 domain contains eight α-helices, with four forming the common CH domain core, and includes an additional N-terminal helix, αN, which interacts with other helices via van der Waals and electrostatic interactions (Stiegler2012Structural).

The crystal structure of the β-parvin CH2 domain in complex with the paxillin LD1 motif reveals a conserved hydrophobic patch on the surface of the CH2 domain, which is crucial for binding (Stiegler2012Structural). The primary sequences of β-parvin and α-parvin CH2 domains differ at only 14 residues, and their structures superpose well, indicating a high degree of structural conservation (Stiegler2012Structural).

PARVB undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that share a common C-terminal region but differ in their N-terminal regions (Mongroo2004βparvin). These isoforms may have distinct functional roles due to variations in their N-terminal sequences.

## Function
PARVB (parvin beta) is a protein that plays a significant role in integrin-mediated signaling pathways, particularly in cell adhesion, cytoskeletal organization, and signal transduction. It is an adaptor protein that interacts with integrin-linked kinase (ILK), and this interaction is crucial for its function in cellular processes. PARVB is involved in the regulation of ILK signaling, where it acts as an inhibitor, preventing excessive signal transmission that could lead to oncogenic effects (Kimura2010Functional; Mongroo2004βparvin).

In healthy cells, PARVB is active in focal adhesions, where it contributes to cell spreading and adhesion by interacting with other proteins such as ARHGEF6 and paxillin. This interaction is essential for the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, which is critical for cell movement and stability (Stiegler2012Structural; Rosenberger2003Interaction). PARVB's role in focal adhesion targeting is facilitated by its CH2 domain, which binds to paxillin LD motifs, highlighting its involvement in maintaining cellular structure (Stiegler2012Structural).

PARVB also modulates the ILK-Akt/PKB signaling pathway, influencing the expression of genes like VEGF-A and stabilizing HIF-1a levels, which are important for cell survival and response to hypoxia (Kimura2010Functional). Its regulatory function in these pathways underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing tumor progression.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PARVB gene have been implicated in various cancers and other conditions. In glioblastoma (GBM), overexpression of PARVB is associated with poor prognosis and is linked to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that enhances cell migration and invasion. This overexpression correlates with shorter survival in GBM patients and is mediated through the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, suggesting that PARVB could be a potential therapeutic target in GBM (Yu2021Construction).

In tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC), particularly the endophytic subtype, PARVB is significantly overexpressed. This overexpression is associated with increased cell migration and lower metastasis-free survival rates, indicating its role in cancer invasiveness and metastasis. PARVB's involvement in actin reorganization and focal adhesions is crucial for these processes, making it a potential biomarker for high-risk TSCC (Eslami2014PARVB).

In urothelial cell carcinoma of the upper urinary tract, PARVB is downregulated, and its low expression is linked to poorer disease-specific survival. This suggests that PARVB may act as a tumor suppressor in this context, with its expression levels serving as an independent prognostic factor for disease-free survival (Wu2010Expression).

## Interactions
PARVB (parvin beta) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization. It directly binds to integrin-linked kinase (ILK) through its C-terminal calponin homology (CH2) domain, forming part of the PINCH-ILK-parvin (PIP) complex, which is essential for cell-extracellular matrix interactions (Wu2004The). PARVB also interacts with paxillin, a scaffolding protein, by binding to its leucine-aspartic acid repeat (LD) motifs via the CH2 domain. This interaction is important for the localization of PARVB to focal adhesions, structures that connect the cell cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix (Stiegler2012Structural).

PARVB competes with α-parvin for binding to ILK, as both proteins cannot bind ILK simultaneously. Overexpression of PARVB inhibits the formation of the ILK-α-parvin complex, which is crucial for cell survival, and promotes apoptosis (Zhang2004Distinct). PARVB also interacts with ARHGEF6 (aPIX), suggesting a role in integrin-mediated signaling during cell spreading (Rosenberger2003Interaction). In the context of cancer, PARVB inhibits ILK signaling, which is implicated in tumor progression, by suppressing ILK kinase activity and downstream phosphorylation events (Mongroo2004βparvin).
