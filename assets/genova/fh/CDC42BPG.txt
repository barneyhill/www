# CDC42BPG

## Overview
CDC42BPG is a gene that encodes the protein CDC42 binding protein kinase gamma, a serine/threonine kinase involved in various cellular processes. This protein plays a crucial role in cytoskeletal organization by interacting with the small GTPase CDC42, which is essential for actin filament assembly and regulation of cell shape. The kinase activity of CDC42 binding protein kinase gamma influences cell migration, adhesion, and structural integrity, thereby impacting cellular responses to environmental stimuli and intercellular communication. Its involvement in these processes underscores its significance in maintaining cellular architecture and function. Additionally, CDC42BPG has been implicated in disease contexts, such as cancer and hyperuricemia, highlighting its clinical relevance (Yasukochi2017Identification; Ruscetta2023Opportunities).

## Function
CDC42BPG, also known as CDC42 binding protein kinase gamma, is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a significant role in cytoskeletal organization. It interacts with the small GTPase CDC42, which is crucial for actin filament assembly and regulation of cell shape. This interaction facilitates various cellular processes, including cell migration and adhesion, by influencing the dynamics of the cytoskeleton. CDC42BPG is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the structural integrity and motility of cells, impacting how cells respond to their environment and communicate with other cells. These functions are essential for maintaining normal cellular architecture and function, which are critical for the overall health and development of an organism. The protein's activity in these processes underscores its importance in cellular biology, particularly in maintaining the balance and organization of the cytoskeleton, which is vital for numerous cellular activities (Yasukochi2017Identification).

## Clinical Significance
CDC42BPG, also known as CDC42 binding protein kinase gamma, has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in cellular signaling pathways. Alterations in the expression of CDC42BPG have been associated with cancer progression and metastasis. Specifically, the MRCKγ protein, encoded by CDC42BPG, is involved in cell motility and F-actin organization, processes that are crucial for cancer cell invasiveness (Ruscetta2023Opportunities). Genomic alterations in CDC42BPG, such as gene amplifications and missense mutations, have been observed in 9% of patients across 32 cancer types, suggesting a significant role in cancer development (Ruscetta2023Opportunities).

In the context of hyperuricemia, a condition characterized by elevated uric acid levels in the blood, CDC42BPG has been identified as a novel susceptibility locus. The single nucleotide variant rs55975541 in CDC42BPG is significantly associated with serum uric acid concentration in a Japanese population, indicating that this gene may independently affect uric acid levels and contribute to hyperuricemia (Yasukochi2017Identification). This finding highlights the importance of genetic background in disease susceptibility, particularly in non-European populations where genetic relations have not been as extensively defined (Yasukochi2017Identification).

## Interactions
CDC42BPG, also known as CDC42-binding protein kinase gamma, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It is a serine/threonine kinase that interacts with the small GTPase CDC42, which plays a role in cytoskeletal organization, cell division, and cell migration (Losier2024Identification). CDC42BPG has been identified as a negative regulator of pexophagy, a type of autophagy related to peroxisomes, by inhibiting autophagy under stress conditions such as clofibrate treatment and starvation (Losier2024Identification).

In the context of cancer, CDC42BPG is suggested to have growth-suppressive effects on osteosarcoma cells by inhibiting CDC42, which is known to activate migration and metastasis in these cells (Tsuda2017Identification). This interaction is part of a feedback loop involving p53, where CDC42 negatively regulates p53 through miR-29, and CDC42BPG may inhibit CDC42, thus influencing the p53/CDC42 pathway (Tsuda2017Identification).

CDC42BPG is also mentioned as a candidate gene for germline cutaneous melanoma susceptibility, although specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids in this context are not detailed (Yepes2020Using).
