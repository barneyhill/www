# MCUB

## Overview
MCUB, or mitochondrial calcium uniporter dominant negative subunit beta, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of mitochondrial calcium uptake. The protein, categorized as a transmembrane protein, is a component of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex (MCUC) and functions as a dominant negative regulator. Unlike the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), MCUB lacks channel activity due to specific amino acid substitutions, which allows it to modulate the activity of the uniporter complex by reducing calcium influx into mitochondria. This regulation is crucial for maintaining calcium homeostasis, particularly in tissues such as the heart and lungs, where it helps protect against calcium overload during stress conditions. MCUB's role in modulating mitochondrial calcium uptake has significant implications for cellular energy production, metabolism, and apoptosis, and it is involved in various physiological and pathological processes, including cardiovascular diseases and cancer (Huo2020MCUb; Lambert2020MCUB; Marchi2014The).

## Structure
MCUB, also known as mitochondrial calcium uniporter dominant negative subunit beta, is a protein that shares approximately 50% sequence similarity with the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) and features a similar protein topology. It is a 33-kDa protein with two transmembrane domains, and both its N- and C-termini are oriented towards the intermembrane space (Marchi2014The). The primary structure of MCUB includes a slightly altered 'DIME' motif, which is crucial for calcium selectivity, differing from MCU by two residues in the pore-forming region (Marchi2014The; Huo2020MCUb).

MCUB does not exhibit channel activity when reconstituted in a lipid bilayer, suggesting it acts as a dominant-negative subunit within the mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex (Marchi2014The). It can form hetero-oligomers with MCU, affecting the quaternary structure of the uniporter complex and modulating calcium uptake (Raffaello2013The). The expression of MCUB is tissue-specific, with higher levels in the heart and lung, which influences mitochondrial calcium uptake and provides protection against calcium overload during stress conditions (Huo2020MCUb; Marchi2014The).

## Function
MCUb, also known as mitochondrial calcium uniporter dominant negative subunit beta, is a protein that modulates the activity of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex. It acts as a dominant negative regulator, influencing calcium uptake into mitochondria by incorporating into the uniporter channel and reducing its activity (Mammucari2017Structure; Murgia2015Molecular). MCUb shares structural similarities with MCU, including two transmembrane domains, but lacks channel activity due to specific amino acid substitutions in the pore-forming region (Marchi2014The; Cui2019Progress).

In healthy human cells, MCUb plays a crucial role in maintaining calcium homeostasis by modulating mitochondrial calcium uptake. This regulation is important for cellular energy production, metabolism, and apoptosis (Lambert2020MCUB). The expression of MCUb varies across tissues, with higher levels in tissues like the heart, which are characterized by low amplitude calcium transients (Murgia2015Molecular). By limiting calcium influx, MCUb helps prevent excessive calcium entry into mitochondria, which could be detrimental to cell function (Mammucari2017Structure). This function is particularly significant in tissues that require tight regulation of calcium dynamics to maintain cellular and organismal homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MCUB gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cardiovascular diseases. MCUB acts as a dominant negative regulator of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex, inhibiting mitochondrial calcium uptake. This function is crucial in protecting the heart from ischemic damage. Overexpression of MCUB in cardiomyocytes has been shown to reduce mitochondrial calcium uptake, thereby providing protection against ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury by decreasing mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening and limiting infarct size and pathological remodeling (Huo2020MCUb). Conversely, deletion of the Mcub gene exacerbates cardiac remodeling and increases infarct size following ischemic injury, indicating that MCUB plays a protective role in the heart (Huo2020MCUb).

In cancer, MCUB expression levels have been inversely correlated with overall survival in gliomas, suggesting a potential pro-tumorigenic role. Knockdown of MCUB in glioma cells suppresses proliferation, migration, and invasion, highlighting its potential impact on tumor progression (Marchi2019Mitochondrial). These findings suggest that MCUB could be a target for therapeutic interventions in both cardiac and cancer pathologies.

## Interactions
MCUB, a subunit of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex (MCUC), plays a significant role in modulating mitochondrial calcium uptake through its interactions with other proteins in the complex. Unlike MCU, MCUB does not directly interact with MICU1 or MICU2. Instead, its incorporation into the uniporter channel displaces MCU and MCU-bound MICU1/2, altering the stoichiometry of the regulatory subunits and acting as a stress-responsive mechanism to limit calcium uptake (Lambert2020MCUB).

MCUB acts as a dominant negative regulator by preventing protein-protein interactions between MCU and several mitochondrial complexes and pathways. It serves as a protein barrier, affecting the MCUC activity and protecting mitochondria from calcium overload and associated cell death (Herran2024Systematic). The interaction of MCU with MCUB is stable, but silencing MCUB leads to a substantial remodeling of the MCU interactome, allowing novel interactions with mitochondrial proteins involved in stress response pathways (Herran2024Systematic).

MCUB also disrupts the interaction between MCU and EMRE, an essential component for proper pore conformation in the MCU-complex, thereby inhibiting acute mitochondrial calcium uptake (Huo2020MCUb). These interactions highlight MCUB's crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial function and calcium homeostasis.
