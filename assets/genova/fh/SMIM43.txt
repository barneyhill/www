# SMIM43

## Overview
SMIM43 is a gene that encodes the small integral membrane protein 43, which is involved in various cellular processes, particularly within the kidneys. This protein is categorized as a small integral membrane protein and plays a significant role in cytoskeletal organization and glucose transport, essential for maintaining cellular structure and energy balance (Acoba2024Kidney). SMIM43 is notably expressed in healthy kidney tissues and is upregulated in response to nephrotoxicant exposure, suggesting its involvement in cellular stress responses and injury repair mechanisms (Merrick2023Insights). Despite being classified as a 'pathway-orphan' gene, its expression patterns and regulatory roles underscore its potential importance in kidney health and disease pathogenesis (Acoba2024Kidney). Additionally, SMIM43 has been implicated in various diseases, including acute HIV infection and hepatitis C liver cirrhosis, highlighting its broader clinical significance (Parker2023Gene).

## Function
SMIM43, a small integral membrane protein, is involved in several cellular processes in healthy human cells. It plays a role in cytoskeletal organization and glucose transport, which are crucial for maintaining cellular structure and energy balance (Acoba2024Kidney). The protein is expressed in healthy kidneys and is implicated in the regulation of these processes, suggesting its importance in normal kidney function (Acoba2024Kidney).

In the context of renal proximal tubule epithelial cells, SMIM43 has been identified as upregulated in response to nephrotoxicant exposure, indicating its potential involvement in cellular stress responses and injury repair mechanisms (Merrick2023Insights). This upregulation suggests that SMIM43 may play a role in the cellular adaptation to environmental stressors, contributing to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis under adverse conditions (Merrick2023Insights).

Despite being categorized as a 'pathway-orphan' gene, SMIM43's expression patterns and regulatory roles in cellular processes highlight its potential significance in kidney health and disease pathogenesis. Further research is needed to fully elucidate its functions and interactions within cellular pathways (Acoba2024Kidney).

## Clinical Significance
The gene SMIM43, also known as TMEM155, has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels. During acute HIV infection, SMIM43 is one of the most highly over-expressed genes, ranking third in terms of fold change. Despite this significant overexpression, it was not correlated with viral load, suggesting its role might be independent of viral load dynamics. This consistent upregulation among individuals with acute HIV indicates its potential as a biomarker for recent infection (Parker2023Gene).

Outside of HIV, SMIM43 has been associated with several other conditions. It has been linked to hepatitis C liver cirrhosis, brain tumors, essential tremor, basal cell nevus syndrome fibroblasts, nystagmus, cerebellar atrophy with motor neuronopathies, and regulation of female fertility (Parker2023Gene). In the context of kidney health, SMIM43 is identified as a 'pathway-orphan' gene, potentially involved in regulating cytoskeletal organization and glucose transport, which may have implications in chronic kidney disease (Acoba2024Kidney). Additionally, SMIM43 has shown significant expression changes in response to nephrotoxicants in renal injury studies, indicating its involvement in cellular responses to toxic exposures (Merrick2023Insights).
