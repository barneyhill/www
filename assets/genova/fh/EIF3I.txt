# EIF3I

## Overview
The EIF3I gene encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit I, a crucial component of the eIF3 complex, which is integral to the initiation of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. The protein encoded by EIF3I is characterized by a WD repeat domain, facilitating protein-protein interactions essential for its function within the eIF3 complex (Rezende2014The; Marchione2013The). As part of the eIF3b-g-i module, EIF3I plays a dynamic role in translation initiation, particularly in mRNA recruitment and stabilization of the pre-initiation complex (Valášek2017Embraced). Beyond its fundamental role in translation, EIF3I is implicated in various cellular processes, including interactions with viral proteins and oncogenic pathways, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states such as cancer (Wang2013OverexpressedeIF3I; Pan2017EIF3i).

## Structure
The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit I (EIF3I) is a component of the eIF3 complex, which is essential for the initiation of protein synthesis. EIF3I is characterized by a WD repeat domain, consisting of seven defined WD repeats that span nearly its entire length. These repeats are involved in protein-protein interactions and are conserved across different eukaryotic species, indicating their importance in the protein's function (Rezende2014The; Marchione2013The).

The secondary structure of EIF3I includes a WD40 β-propeller, a common structural motif in proteins that facilitates interactions with other proteins. This β-propeller structure is shared with the eIF3b subunit, and they are connected via the C-terminal extended α-helical domain of eIF3b (Valášek2017Embraced).

In terms of quaternary structure, EIF3I is part of the eIF3b-g-i module within the eIF3 complex. This module is mobile and plays a dynamic role in translation initiation, particularly during mRNA recruitment and stabilization of the pre-initiation complex (Valášek2017Embraced). Specific residues in EIF3I are involved in interactions with other eIF3 subunits, such as eIF3b and eIF3g, highlighting its role in the structural integrity and function of the eIF3 complex (Rezende2014The). 

Post-translational modifications of EIF3I, such as phosphorylation, are suggested but not detailed in the available literature (Marchione2013The). There is no specific information on splice variant isoforms of EIF3I in the provided context.

## Function
The EIF3I gene encodes a subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex, which is essential for the initiation of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. The eIF3 complex plays a critical role in assembling the 40S ribosomal subunit with mRNA and initiator tRNA, facilitating the start of translation. EIF3I is one of the core subunits of the eIF3 complex and is crucial for the formation of the 43S preinitiation complex, which is necessary for the recruitment of mRNAs to the ribosome (Zhou2005PCI).

In healthy human cells, EIF3I is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the regulation of gene expression and cellular growth. The eIF3 complex, including EIF3I, is involved in the regulation of translation initiation, which is a key step in protein synthesis. This process is vital for cell growth and proliferation, as it ensures that proteins are synthesized efficiently and accurately. The eIF3 complex also plays a role in preventing premature association between ribosomal subunits, thereby maintaining the fidelity of translation initiation (Marchione2013The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the EIF3I gene have been implicated in various cancers, including gliomas and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In gliomas, particularly astrocytomas of WHO grades I-IV, EIF3I expression is significantly increased compared to non-neoplastic cortical control brain tissue. This increase is associated with poorer overall survival in glioma patients, suggesting that EIF3I could serve as a prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target in glioma therapy (Krassnig2021A). EIF3I's role in gliomas is further supported by its association with the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which is known to be dysregulated in these tumors (Krassnig2021A).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, EIF3I is often overexpressed, leading to the activation of oncogenic Akt1 signaling. This interaction prevents the dephosphorylation of Akt1 by PP2A, resulting in constitutively active Akt1 signaling, which promotes tumorigenic properties such as increased cell proliferation and tumor growth. EIF3I overexpression is observed in a significant proportion of HCC tumors, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention, particularly through the use of Akt1 inhibitors (Wang2013OverexpressedeIF3I).

## Interactions
The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit I (EIF3I) is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. EIF3I is a component of the eIF3 complex, which is essential for translation initiation. It interacts with other subunits such as eIF3b and eIF3g, forming a module that relocates to the ribosomal subunit interface during translation initiation, influencing start codon selection (Llácer2018eIF3b; Valášek2017Embraced).

EIF3I also interacts with the matrix (M) protein of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), affecting viral replication. This interaction was demonstrated through various assays, including GST pull-down and yeast two-hybrid systems, and was shown to influence VSV growth (Pan2017EIF3i).

In the context of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), EIF3I interacts with the oncogenic protein Akt1. This interaction enhances Akt1 phosphorylation and kinase activity, promoting tumorigenesis. EIF3I prevents the dephosphorylation of Akt1 by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), leading to sustained Akt1 signaling (Wang2013OverexpressedeIF3I).

EIF3I also interacts with PDL1, playing a role in diabetic ulcer healing by regulating the eIF3I-PDL1-IRS4 axis, which is crucial for re-epithelialization and inflammatory response (Kuai2022PDL1).
