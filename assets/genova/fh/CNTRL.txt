# CNTRL

## Overview
The CNTRL gene encodes the protein centriolin, a centrosomal protein that plays a pivotal role in cell division, particularly during the final stages of cytokinesis. Centriolin is characterized by its structural features, including coiled-coil regions and leucine-rich repeat motifs, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins. Functionally, centriolin is essential for the anchoring of exocyst and SNARE complexes at the midbody, enabling the abscission process that separates daughter cells. It also contributes to centrosome maturation and cell cycle progression, with its activity peaking during metaphase. Disruptions in centriolin function or expression can lead to cytokinesis failure and chromosomal instability, which are associated with oncogenesis and various cancers (Gromley2005Centriolin; Doxsey2005CENTROSOMES; Gromley2003A).

## Structure
Centriolin (CNTRL) is a centrosomal protein with a molecular weight of approximately 270 kDa. It is characterized by several structural features, including multiple coiled-coil regions and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs near the NH2 terminus. These LRR motifs are part of the SDS22-like LRR subfamily, which are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions (Muto2010CLERC; Gromley2003A). The NH2 terminus of centriolin shares homology with yeast spindle pole body proteins Nud1p and Cdc11p, which are involved in mitosis and cytokinesis (Gromley2003A). 

The carboxy terminus of centriolin is identical to CEP110, a centrosomal protein associated with oncogenic activity (Gromley2003A). Centriolin's structure includes domains that are crucial for its function in centrosome maturation and cytokinesis. The protein's secondary structure is indicated by the presence of coiled-coil regions, which are interrupted by noncoiled domains (Gromley2003A). 

Centriolin is involved in microtubule dynamics, potentially influencing microtubule stability and destabilization through its interaction with other centrosomal proteins (Kumari2018Regulation). The protein's role in cytokinesis and its structural similarities with oncogenic proteins suggest its involvement in oncogenesis (Gromley2003A).

## Function
Centriolin, encoded by the CNTRL gene, is a crucial protein involved in the final stages of cytokinesis, particularly in the process of abscission, which is the separation of daughter cells. It localizes to the midbody during cytokinesis and is essential for anchoring exocyst and SNARE complexes, which are necessary for secretory-vesicle-mediated abscission (Gromley2005Centriolin). Centriolin interacts with components of the exocyst complex, such as sec3, sec5, sec8, sec15, exo70, and exo84, and is necessary for the midbody localization of v-SNARE and t-SNARE proteins, including endobrevin/VAMP8 and syntaxin-2 (Gromley2005Centriolin).

In addition to its role in cytokinesis, centriolin is involved in cell cycle progression. It localizes to the maternal centriole and intercellular bridge, influencing entry into the S phase of the cell cycle (Gromley2003A). The protein is also associated with centrosome maturation, with its levels peaking at metaphase and diminishing by late anaphase/telophase (Gromley2003A). Disruption of centriolin leads to cytokinesis failure, resulting in multinucleated cells and persistent intercellular bridges, highlighting its critical role in cell division (Seronick2022CRISPRCas9).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the CNTRL gene, which encodes the protein centriolin, have been implicated in various diseases, particularly those related to cell cycle regulation and cancer. Centriolin is crucial for cytokinesis, the final step of cell division, and its dysfunction can lead to cytokinesis failure, resulting in chromosomal instability and tumorigenesis (Doxsey2005CENTROSOMES). This instability is a hallmark of many cancers, where abnormalities in centrosome number and function are frequently observed (Schatten2018Functions).

Centriolin's role in recruiting factors necessary for targeted secretion to the midbody during cell division is essential for proper cell cycle progression. Depletion of centriolin causes defects similar to those seen in cells lacking centrosomes, which can lead to G1 phase arrest and contribute to tumorigenesis (Doxsey2005CENTROSOMES). The potential link between centriolin dysfunction and cancer is further supported by its involvement in centrosome amplification, a recognized feature in various human tumors, including breast, colon, and prostate cancers (Schatten2018Functions).

Overall, disruptions in CNTRL interactions and expression levels can significantly impact cellular division processes, contributing to the development and progression of cancer.

## Interactions
Centriolin (CNTRL) is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its role in cytokinesis and cell cycle progression. It interacts with components of the exocyst complex, including sec15, sec8, and sec5, as well as the SNARE-associated protein snapin. These interactions are essential for anchoring the exocyst and SNARE complexes at the midbody during cytokinesis, facilitating secretory-vesicle-mediated abscission (Gromley2005Centriolin). Centriolin's presence at the midbody is independent of the exocyst complex, as depletion of sec5 disrupts the exocyst without affecting centriolin's localization (Gromley2005Centriolin).

Centriolin also interacts with HectD1, a ubiquitin E3 ligase, in a cell cycle-dependent manner. This interaction peaks during mitosis, suggesting that centriolin may serve as a substrate for HectD1, potentially involving ubiquitination processes (Salas2023Centriolin). The interaction between centriolin and HectD1 is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies, showing their co-localization at spindle poles during mitosis (Salas2023Centriolin). These interactions highlight centriolin's role in coordinating complex cellular processes during cell division.
