# SUPT6H

## Overview
SUPT6H is a gene that encodes the SPT6 protein, a histone chaperone and transcription elongation factor, which plays a pivotal role in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation. The SPT6 protein is primarily active in the nucleus, where it interacts with RNA polymerase II and histones to facilitate transcriptional elongation and maintain chromatin structure. This protein is crucial for the elongation phase of transcription and is involved in various cellular processes, including DNA replication and genome stability. Its interactions with other proteins, such as the human Iws1 and components of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2, underscore its multifaceted role in gene expression regulation. The SUPT6H gene has been implicated in several cancers, where its mutations and alterations can influence tumor growth and progression, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Ponting2002Novel; Miller2022The; Oqani2019Iws1; Zhang2024A).

## Function
SUPT6H encodes a histone chaperone and transcription elongation factor that plays a critical role in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation in human cells. The protein is primarily active in the nucleus, where it interacts with RNA polymerase II and histones to facilitate transcriptional elongation and maintain chromatin structure (Ponting2002Novel; Oqani2019Iws1). SUPT6H binds to the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, particularly when phosphorylated at Ser2, which is essential for proper pre-mRNA splicing and mRNA export (Oqani2019Iws1). This interaction is crucial for the elongation phase of transcription and is associated with the recruitment of SETD2, responsible for the trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine 36 (H3K36me3), a modification important for transcription accuracy (Oqani2019Iws1).

SUPT6H is also involved in DNA replication and genome stability. It interacts with the replication machinery, and its depletion can impair DNA replication, leading to genome instability (Miller2022The). The protein's role in transcription and replication highlights its importance in maintaining cellular and genomic integrity, influencing processes such as embryonic stem cell maintenance and differentiation (Miller2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SUPT6H gene have been implicated in various cancers. In breast cancer, SUPT6H is identified as a potential biomarker due to its role in controlling the expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα). A decrease in SUPT6H protein levels, possibly due to mutations, can lead to increased tumor growth by unwinding chromatin and exposing it for unhindered expression of ERα, making it a potential therapeutic target (Zhang2024A). In gastrointestinal cancers, SUPT6H promotes tumor growth through transcription elongation and mRNA processing, with its tumor-promotive function regulated by posttranslational modifications rather than changes in expression levels (Konishi2021The). The gene also shows significant mutations in ulcerative colitis-associated colorectal cancer, suggesting a role in epigenetic regulation in the context of chronic inflammation (Yan2019Whole).

SUPT6H has been associated with germ cell tumors, where rare germline variants may predispose progenitor germ cells to malignant transformation (p&gt; Crowgey2020&lt; Germline). Additionally, SUPT6H is involved in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation, potentially affecting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in breast cancer (Lavin2020Unresolved). These findings highlight the gene's significance in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
The SUPT6H gene encodes the SPT6 protein, which is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. SPT6 interacts with the Ser2-phosphorylated C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), a crucial interaction for mRNA processing and export. This binding is mediated by the SH2 domain of SPT6, which specifically recognizes Ser2-phosphorylated residues, distinguishing it from other phosphorylation states (Yoh2007The).

SPT6 also interacts with the human Iws1 protein, which connects SPT6 to the RNA export factor REF1/Aly. This interaction is essential for mRNA processing and export, as Iws1 facilitates the recruitment of REF1/Aly to the transcription complex (Yoh2007The). SPT6 binds to Iws1 through its N-terminal region, while the C-terminal SH2 domain interacts with RNAPIIo (Yoh2007The).

In addition, SPT6 interacts with components of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), particularly Suz12. This interaction is direct and does not require RNA, allowing SPT6 to displace Ezh2 from Suz12, thereby counteracting PRC2 recruitment to chromatin and alleviating transcriptional repression (Wang2017The).
