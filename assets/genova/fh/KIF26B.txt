# KIF26B

## Overview
KIF26B is a gene that encodes the protein kinesin family member 26B, which is part of the kinesin superfamily of motor proteins. This protein is classified as an N-type kinesin, indicating its role in intracellular transport along microtubules towards their plus-end (Seog2004Molecular). Kinesin family member 26B is involved in various cellular processes, including cell polarity, migration, and adhesion, particularly in endothelial and mesenchymal cells. It plays a significant role in the planar cell polarity signaling pathway by interacting with proteins such as Dishevelled (Dvl) and Daam1, which are crucial for microtubule stabilization and cell motility (GuillabertGourgues2016Kif26b). The protein's function is regulated through post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which influence its stability and degradation (Terabayashi2012Phosphorylation). KIF26B's expression and activity are implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and developmental disorders, underscoring its importance in cellular organization and function (Bartik2022Whole; Yang2018Upregulation).

## Structure
KIF26B is a member of the kinesin superfamily, specifically classified as an N-type kinesin, which suggests it moves towards the plus-end of microtubules (Seog2004Molecular). The protein contains a motor domain that is crucial for its interaction with microtubules and is involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis, essential for its function in intracellular transport (Wojcik2018De; GuillabertGourgues2016Kif26b). This motor domain is highly conserved and shares over 40% amino acid sequence similarity with the kinesin 8 motor domain (Wojcik2018De).

KIF26B also interacts with proteins such as Dishevelled (Dvl) and Daam1, which are part of the Wnt planar cell polarity signaling pathway, indicating its role in cell polarity and migration (GuillabertGourgues2016Kif26b). The protein is involved in microtubule stabilization, which is crucial for cell polarity and motility (GuillabertGourgues2016Kif26b).

Post-translational modifications of KIF26B include phosphorylation, which affects its stability and function. Phosphorylation by CDKs is linked to its dissociation from microtubules and subsequent degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Terabayashi2012Phosphorylation). The protein's expression is also regulated by the Wnt5a-Ror signaling pathway, which modulates its levels through a noncanonical mechanism (Susman2017Kinesin).

## Function
KIF26B is a kinesin family protein that plays a crucial role in cell polarity, migration, and adhesion, particularly in endothelial and mesenchymal cells. In endothelial cells, KIF26B is involved in the planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway, interacting with Dishevelled (Dvl) and Daam1 to regulate microtubule (MT) stabilization, which is essential for directional migration and cell polarity during angiogenesis (GuillabertGourgues2016Kif26b). KIF26B stabilizes the MT network, facilitating the proper orientation of the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) and Golgi apparatus, which are critical for establishing cell polarity and directional movement (GuillabertGourgues2016Kif26b).

In mesenchymal cells, KIF26B regulates cell adhesion and polarization by modulating integrin α8 expression and interacting with nonmuscle myosin heavy chain II (NMHC II), specifically MYH10. This interaction enhances cell-cell adhesion, which is vital for kidney development (Uchiyama2010Kif26b). KIF26B also undergoes phosphorylation and polyubiquitination, leading to its degradation, a process crucial for kidney development and regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4 (Terabayashi2012Phosphorylation). These molecular activities highlight KIF26B's significant role in maintaining cellular organization and function in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the KIF26B gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly cancers and developmental disorders. In ovarian cancer, KIF26B is upregulated and associated with increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, contributing to the aggressiveness of the disease. High expression levels of KIF26B correlate with reduced overall survival and poor prognosis in ovarian cancer patients (Yang2018Upregulation). Similarly, in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), KIF26B overexpression is linked to tumor progression and poor clinical outcomes. The gene promotes HCC cell proliferation and invasion through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (Li2019miR450b5p).

KIF26B is also involved in developmental disorders. Mutations in KIF26B have been associated with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and kidney malformations, such as renal hypodysplasia, due to its role in kidney development (Bartik2022Whole). A de novo missense variant in KIF26B, p.Gly546Ser, has been linked to pontocerebellar hypoplasia with infantile spinal muscular atrophy, affecting the gene's function in cell adhesion and neurodevelopment (Wojcik2018De). These findings highlight the clinical significance of KIF26B in both cancer progression and developmental abnormalities.

## Interactions
KIF26B is known to interact with several proteins, forming multiprotein complexes that play crucial roles in cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with the Dishevelled (Dvl) and Dishevelled-associated activator of morphogenesis (Daam1) complexes, which are part of the planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway. This interaction is essential for regulating endothelial cell polarity and migration. KIF26B associates with microtubule structures and is involved in microtubule stabilization, which is critical for cell polarity and directional migration (GuillabertGourgues2016Kif26b).

KIF26B also interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4. This interaction is mediated by phosphorylation at specific sites by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which enhances its polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. This regulatory mechanism is significant during kidney development (Terabayashi2012Phosphorylation).

In the context of WNT5A signaling, KIF26B interacts with noncanonical WNT5A receptors ROR1 and ROR2, as well as the Frizzled (FZD) family of receptors and the Dishevelled (DVL) family of proteins. These interactions promote KIF26B degradation, highlighting its role in WNT5A-dependent signaling pathways (Karuna2018Identification).
