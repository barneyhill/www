# LIMS4

## Overview
LIMS4, or LIM zinc finger domain containing 4, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in critical cellular processes, particularly cytoskeletal organization and cell adhesion. The protein, also named LIMS4, is characterized by the presence of LIM domains, which are specialized zinc finger motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions. These interactions are crucial for the protein's role in maintaining cell structure and integrity. Predominantly active in the cytoplasm, LIMS4 contributes to the organization of the cytoskeleton, a network of fibers essential for providing structural support to cells and facilitating various cellular functions, including movement and division. Additionally, LIMS4 plays a significant role in cell adhesion, which is vital for maintaining tissue integrity and enabling cellular communication. Through its participation in signaling pathways, LIMS4 helps regulate processes critical for the proper functioning of cells and tissues, ensuring correct cell adhesion to each other and the extracellular matrix, thereby supporting the structural and functional stability of tissues (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Function
LIMS4 (LIM zinc finger domain containing 4) encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in cellular processes such as cytoskeletal organization and cell adhesion. The protein is characterized by the presence of LIM domains, which are specialized zinc finger motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions. These interactions are essential for the protein's function in maintaining cell structure and integrity. LIMS4 is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the organization of the cytoskeleton, a network of fibers that provides structural support to cells and is involved in various cellular functions including movement and division.

The protein's role in cell adhesion is vital for maintaining tissue integrity and facilitating cellular communication. By participating in signaling pathways, LIMS4 helps regulate processes that are critical for the proper functioning of cells and tissues. The interactions mediated by the LIM domains of LIMS4 are integral to its function in these pathways, ensuring that cells adhere correctly to each other and to the extracellular matrix. This adhesion is crucial for the formation and maintenance of tissues, impacting overall organismal health by supporting the structural and functional stability of cells within tissues.
