# CHRNA5

## Overview
The CHRNA5 gene encodes the cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 5 subunit, a component of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which are categorized as ligand-gated ion channels. These receptors are integral to cholinergic signaling in the central nervous system, influencing neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity. The α5 subunit, although not directly involved in ligand binding, modulates receptor properties by affecting ion channel permeability and receptor sensitivity to acetylcholine. It plays a crucial role in cognitive functions, particularly in the prefrontal cortex, by enhancing calcium permeability and preventing receptor desensitization during prolonged exposure to neurotransmitters. The CHRNA5 gene is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that contribute to the functional diversity of nAChRs. Variations in this gene have been linked to several neuropsychiatric and smoking-related disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Scholze2020The; Venkatesan2020Chrna5is; Brynildsen2021Linking).

## Structure
The CHRNA5 gene encodes the α5 subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which are ligand-gated ion channels. The α5 subunit is characterized by a large cytoplasmic loop between the third and fourth transmembrane domains, known as the M3-M4 loop, which is significant for receptor assembly, trafficking, and targeting to the plasma membrane (Scholze2020The). This loop may also mediate G protein signaling, adding a metabotropic dimension to the receptor's function (Scholze2020The).

The α5 subunit does not contribute to the primary or complementary ligand-binding sites but influences the receptor's properties through its involvement in the channel's lining and potential allosteric binding sites (Scholze2020The). The α5 subunit can co-assemble with other subunits like α4, β2, α3, and β4 to form various receptor subtypes, contributing to the diversity of nAChR functions (Scholze2020The).

Alternative splicing of the CHRNA5 gene results in multiple isoforms, with isoform-1 being the full-length transcript and the most abundant. Isoforms-2, -3, and -4 can form a completely folded extracellular domain without any transmembrane domain, while isoform-5 lacks a significant part of the distorted β sandwich, indicating potential instability (Falvella2013Multiple).

## Function
The CHRNA5 gene encodes the α5 subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which are crucial for cholinergic modulation in the central nervous system. These receptors are ligand-gated ion channels that, when activated by acetylcholine, allow the influx of calcium and other ions into neurons, influencing neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity (Doyle2011In). The α5 subunit is particularly important for the rapid onset of cholinergic responses in the prefrontal cortex, a region involved in attention and executive function. It enhances the sensitivity of nicotinic receptors to acetylcholine and increases calcium permeability, which is essential for optimal attention performance (Venkatesan2020Chrna5is).

In healthy cells, the α5 subunit plays a protective role by preventing desensitization of nicotinic receptors during prolonged exposure to acetylcholine or nicotine, thereby maintaining effective cholinergic signaling (Venkatesan2020Chrna5is). The α5 subunit is also involved in corticothalamic signaling and sensory input processing, influencing the timing of peak cholinergic modulation of layer 6 pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex (Venkatesan2020Chrna5is). This subunit's function is critical for maintaining attention and cognitive processes, and its disruption is linked to attention deficits and cognitive impairments (Venkatesan2020Chrna5is).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CHRNA5 gene, which encodes the alpha 5 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. The D398N single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in CHRNA5 is associated with increased risk for nicotine and opioid dependence, while it appears to be protective against alcohol and cocaine dependence (Brynildsen2021Linking). This SNP affects the function of neural circuits involved in drug reward and aversion, impacting dopamine release in the brain's reward pathways (Brynildsen2021Linking).

The CHRNA5 gene is also linked to smoking-related diseases. The SNP rs16969968 in CHRNA5 is associated with nicotine dependence and has been identified as a predictor of smoking-related behaviors and diseases, including lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (Yao2021Epigenomewide; Ware2012From). Alterations in CHRNA5 expression, influenced by DNA methylation, have been suggested to play a causal role in these conditions (Yao2021Epigenomewide).

Additionally, genetic variations in the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 gene cluster have been associated with alcohol dependence, highlighting the gene's role in addictive behaviors (Wang2008Genetic). These findings underscore the clinical significance of CHRNA5 in substance dependence and related health issues.

## Interactions
The CHRNA5 protein, encoded by the CHRNA5 gene, is involved in several significant protein interactions that influence cancer progression. In laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), CHRNA5 interacts with the RABL6 protein, a member of the Ras family of small GTPases. This interaction is enhanced by nicotine and is crucial for the metastatic ability of LSCC cells. CHRNA5 binds specifically to the RABL6-39-279 amino acid region, and this interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays (Shen2024Nicotineinduced). The CHRNA5-RABL6 complex may prevent the degradation of RABL6, facilitating its sustained expression and promoting LSCC metastasis (Shen2024Nicotineinduced).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), CHRNA5, through its encoded α5-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α5-nAChR), is associated with the regulation of PD-L1 expression via the STAT3/JAB1-PD-L1 signaling pathway. This interaction is implicated in immune escape mechanisms, where α5-nAChR expression correlates with increased PD-L1 levels, contributing to an immunosuppressive tumor environment (Zhu2022Alpha5). These interactions highlight the role of CHRNA5 in modulating cancer cell behavior and suggest potential therapeutic targets for intervention.
