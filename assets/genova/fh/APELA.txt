# APELA

## Overview
APELA, also known as Elabela, is a gene that encodes a peptide ligand for the apelin receptor (APJ), which is a G protein-coupled receptor. The protein product of APELA, referred to as the apelin receptor early endogenous ligand, plays a pivotal role in various physiological processes, particularly in cardiovascular development and function. It is expressed in human embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, and adult kidney tissue, indicating its function as a natural hormone in humans (Wang2015ElabelaApelin). The APELA protein is involved in critical signaling pathways, such as the suppression of cAMP production and activation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which are essential for cellular communication and function (Wang2015ElabelaApelin). Its interaction with the APJ receptor is crucial for processes like angiogenesis and blood vessel relaxation, underscoring its importance in maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis and development (Wang2015ElabelaApelin).

## Function
APELA, also known as ELABELA, is a peptide ligand for the apelin receptor (APJ), a G protein-coupled receptor. In healthy human cells, APELA is involved in several critical molecular processes, particularly in cardiovascular development and function. It is expressed in human embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, and adult kidney tissue, suggesting its role as a natural hormone in humans (Wang2015ElabelaApelin). APELA activates the APJ receptor, leading to the suppression of cAMP production, activation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and mobilization of intracellular calcium, which are key signaling pathways in cellular communication and function (Wang2015ElabelaApelin).

APELA plays a significant role in angiogenesis, promoting vascular tube formation in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells, and induces blood vessel relaxation in a dose-dependent manner (Wang2015ElabelaApelin). This activity is crucial for regulating the circulatory system during both embryonic development and adulthood. APELA's expression in the kidney aligns with its role in maintaining fluid balance and blood pressure, indicating its function as a paracrine or endocrine hormone (Wang2015ElabelaApelin). The ELA-APJ signaling pathway is conserved across vertebrates, underscoring its importance in cardiovascular homeostasis and development (Wang2015ElabelaApelin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the APELA gene, also known as Elabela, have been associated with several clinical conditions. Variants in the 5'-UTR of the APELA gene, specifically c.-306A > G and c.-145A > G, have been linked to preeclampsia (PE), a pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure and potential organ damage. These variants are rare and were found exclusively in individuals with PE, suggesting they may impair APELA expression and contribute to the disease's pathogenesis by affecting placental development and angiogenesis (Yang2019Variants).

APELA is also implicated in cardiovascular development, and its deficiency can lead to cardiovascular defects. In animal models, the absence of APELA results in embryonic lethality and underdeveloped cardiovascular structures, highlighting its critical role in heart morphogenesis (Chapman2021The; Eberlé2019Elabela). Additionally, APELA's interaction with the APJ receptor is crucial for normal cardiovascular function, and disruptions in this interaction may contribute to cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure and hypertension (Marsault2019The; Eberlé2019Elabela). These findings underscore the potential of targeting the APELA-APJ axis in therapeutic strategies for related conditions.

## Interactions
APELA, also known as Elabela, is a peptide ligand that interacts with the apelin receptor (APJ), a G protein-coupled receptor. APELA binds to APJ and activates distinct signaling pathways, including G protein-dependent and β-arrestin-dependent pathways. This interaction influences physiological activities such as cardiac development and fluid homeostasis (Jiang2021The). APELA shows a strong bias towards β-arrestin-dependent signaling, which is significant for its role in receptor internalization and activation (Jiang2021The).

In zebrafish, APELA is involved in blood vessel regeneration and remodeling. It interacts with the apelin receptor (Aplnr) to mediate receptor internalization and activation, playing a crucial role in vessel formation and remodeling processes (Nys2024Apela). APELA's interaction with Aplnr is essential for cardiac development, as zebrafish embryos deficient in APELA or Aplnr exhibit cardiac malformations (Nys2024Apela).

APELA also interacts with various signaling pathways, such as the AKT pathway, which is implicated in angiogenesis and vessel remodeling. This interaction is crucial for the formation of the sub-intestinal venous plexus in zebrafish embryos (Nys2024Apela). These interactions highlight APELA's role in cardiovascular development and its potential therapeutic applications.
