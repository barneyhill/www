# ENTPD7

## Overview
ENTPD7 is a gene that encodes the protein ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 7, a member of the ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase (ENTPDase) family. This family of enzymes is involved in the regulation of extracellular nucleotide levels, particularly ATP and ADP, by hydrolyzing them into AMP. ENTPD7 is characterized as a transmembrane protein with a significant extracellular domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity. Unlike other ENTPD family members that are typically found on the cell surface, ENTPD7 is expressed as a luminal enzyme within intracellular organelles, playing a unique role in cellular processes (Möller2007Monitoring). The protein is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including immune regulation and cancer progression, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target (Wen2019Inhibition; Giuliani2021Ectonucleotidases).

## Structure
ENTPD7 is a member of the ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase (ENTPDase) family, which consists of proteins that regulate extracellular ATP levels. The molecular structure of ENTPD7 includes cytosolic N-and C-terminal tails, two transmembrane spanning domains, and an extracellular domain of approximately 440 amino acids. This extracellular domain contains the ligand-binding site and four conserved cysteines, which are likely involved in forming intrachain disulfide bridges (Möller2007Monitoring). ENTPD7 shares structural similarities with the actin/HSP70/sugar kinase superfamily, indicating a conserved evolutionary pathway (Möller2007Monitoring).

ENTPD7 is expressed as a luminal enzyme within intracellular organelles, distinguishing it from other ENTPD family members that are cell surface enzymes (Möller2007Monitoring). The protein's structure is similar to P2X purinoceptors, which are known for their role in ligand-gated ion channel activity (Möller2007Monitoring). The high sequence identity among ENTPD orthologues (80-90%) suggests a conserved function across species, while paralogues within a species show lower identity (30-50%) (Möller2007Monitoring). The lack of specific antibodies recognizing ENTPD7 in its native conformation has posed challenges for structural studies (Möller2007Monitoring).

## Function
ENTPD7, or ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 7, is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the hydrolysis of extracellular nucleotides, specifically ATP and ADP, into AMP. This activity is significant in regulating extracellular ATP levels, which are pivotal in purinergic signaling pathways. In healthy human cells, ENTPD7 is expressed on the surface of mucosal epithelial cells in the small intestine, where it modulates the luminal ATP concentration. This regulation is essential for controlling the development and function of Th17 cells, a subset of T helper cells involved in immune responses (Vuerich2019Ectonucleotidases; Giuliani2021Ectonucleotidases).

By maintaining appropriate ATP levels, ENTPD7 helps prevent excessive inflammation and supports immune homeostasis in the gut. In the absence of ENTPD7, as observed in Entpd7 -/- mice, there is an accumulation of Th17 cells due to elevated ATP levels, indicating the enzyme's role in maintaining immune balance (Giuliani2021Ectonucleotidases). This function is crucial for preventing inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel diseases, where dysregulation of Th17 cells is a contributing factor (Giuliani2021Ectonucleotidases).

## Clinical Significance
ENTPD7 has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels. In lung cancer, ENTPD7 is overexpressed in cancerous tissues and cell lines compared to normal lung epithelial cells. This overexpression is associated with advanced TNM stages and lower survival rates in patients. Silencing ENTPD7 in lung cancer cells leads to decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis, suggesting its role in cancer progression and potential as a therapeutic target (Wen2019Inhibition).

In glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer, a circular RNA derived from the ENTPD7 gene, known as circENTPD7, is overexpressed. This overexpression correlates with advanced tumor classification and poor survival outcomes. CircENTPD7 acts as a miRNA sponge, influencing the expression of genes like ROS1, which promotes tumor growth and motility (Zhu2020A).

ENTPD7 also plays a role in inflammatory conditions. In the context of inflammatory bowel diseases, ENTPD7 regulates Th17 cell maturation in the small intestine by controlling luminal ATP levels. Its deficiency leads to increased Th17 cell accumulation, suggesting its involvement in immune response modulation (Giuliani2021Ectonucleotidases).

Additionally, ENTPD7 expression is altered in pulmonary arterial hypertension, where it is upregulated in endothelial cells, potentially contributing to disease pathogenesis (Hennigs2019The). In bipolar disorder, ENTPD7 is differentially expressed, indicating a possible link to the disorder's pathogenesis through oxidative stress pathways (Seregin2023Differential).
