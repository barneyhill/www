# HPRT1

## Overview
The HPRT1 gene encodes the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HGPRT), a critical component of the purine salvage pathway. This enzyme is responsible for catalyzing the conversion of hypoxanthine to inosine monophosphate (IMP) and guanine to guanosine monophosphate (GMP), utilizing 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) as a substrate. HGPRT is categorized as a transferase enzyme, specifically involved in nucleotide metabolism, and is essential for maintaining nucleotide balance and supporting DNA and RNA synthesis (Davidson1989Human; Krenitsky1969Human). The enzyme's activity is crucial for preventing the overproduction of uric acid, thereby reducing the risk of conditions such as gout (Krenitsky1969Human). Mutations in the HPRT1 gene can lead to significant clinical conditions, including Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, characterized by neurological dysfunction and hyperuricemia (Duan2004Structural; Torres2010Clinical). Additionally, alterations in HPRT1 expression have been linked to various cancers, influencing tumor proliferation and immune interactions (Lu2024Prognostic).

## Structure
The HPRT1 gene encodes the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, which plays a crucial role in the purine salvage pathway. The enzyme's primary structure consists of 217 amino acid residues, with a significant portion of these residues being mutable, as evidenced by the identification of numerous missense mutations affecting its function (Duan2004Structural).

The secondary structure of HPRT1 includes 10 beta-strands and six alpha-helices, forming a core region characterized by a parallel beta-sheet flanked by alpha-helices (Duan2004Structural). The tertiary structure features a core α/β structure resembling the nucleotide-binding fold of dehydrogenases, with a second lobe composed of residues from the amino and carboxy termini (Eads1994The). This structure is crucial for the enzyme's catalytic activity, as it facilitates the transfer of ribose and phosphate groups (Eads1994The).

In terms of quaternary structure, HPRT1 can form dimers or tetramers, depending on the bound ligand and environmental conditions such as ionic strength and pH (Duan2004Structural; Eads1994The). The enzyme's active site is located in a cleft above the central beta-sheet, where it binds substrates like GMP (Eads1994The). The enzyme's structure and function are further influenced by specific residues involved in ligand binding and dimer interactions, such as those in the catalytic loop (Duan2004Structural).

## Function
The HPRT1 gene encodes the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT), which is crucial for the purine salvage pathway in human cells. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of hypoxanthine to inosine monophosphate (IMP) and guanine to guanosine monophosphate (GMP) using 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) as a substrate. This process is essential for recycling purines, maintaining nucleotide balance, and supporting DNA and RNA synthesis (Davidson1989Human; Eads1994The; Krenitsky1969Human).

HGPRT is active in the cytoplasm and plays a significant role in preventing the overproduction of uric acid, which can lead to conditions such as gout. The enzyme's activity is regulated by magnesium ions, which enhance its catalytic efficiency by forming complexes with the substrate (Krenitsky1969Human). The enzyme's structure includes a core α/β fold and a flexible loop that sequesters the active site during catalysis, ensuring specificity and function (Schramm1999The2.0Åstructureofhumanhypoxanthineguaninephosphoribosyltransferaseincomplexwithatransitionstateanaloginhibitor).

In healthy human cells, HGPRT's function is vital for maintaining nucleotide pools and preventing the accumulation of DNA and nucleotide lesions, thereby reducing replication errors and the risk of genetic disorders (Agrahari2019Understanding).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HPRT1 gene are primarily associated with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS), a severe neurogenetic disorder characterized by hyperuricemia, neurological dysfunction, and self-injurious behavior. This condition is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, which is crucial for the purine salvage pathway. LNS is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner, predominantly affecting males, though rare cases in females have been reported due to skewed X-chromosome inactivation (Duan2004Structural; AlBakheet2023Detailed; Torres2010Clinical).

Other conditions related to HPRT1 mutations include HPRT-related hyperuricemia with neurological dysfunction (HRND) and HPRT-related hyperuricemia (HRH), which are less severe than LNS. HRND lacks the self-injurious behavior seen in LNS, while HRH is relatively benign (Duan2004Structural).

Alterations in HPRT1 expression have also been implicated in various cancers. The gene is upregulated in several tumor types, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, where it is associated with tumor cell proliferation and immune evasion. HPRT1 expression correlates with immune cell infiltration and can influence the tumor microenvironment, affecting prognosis and treatment outcomes (Lu2024Prognostic).

## Interactions
HPRT1 (hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1) is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are significant for its function in nucleotide metabolism. One notable interaction is with the ALDH16A1 protein, a non-catalytic enzyme. ALDH16A1 is hypothesized to interact with HPRT1, potentially forming complexes that influence uric acid metabolism. This interaction is particularly relevant in the context of gout, where disruptions in the interaction may contribute to hyperuricemia (Vasiliou2013ALDH16A1).

HPRT1 also forms homotetrameric structures, which are crucial for its enzymatic activity. The protein interacts through three separate dimer interfaces: A-B, A-C, and A-D, with the A-C interface being functionally important. Mutations in these regions can lead to severe phenotypes, affecting the protein's ability to bind ligands and maintain structural integrity (Duan2004Structural).

In the context of cancer, HPRT1 is involved in complex networks of interactions with various genes and chemicals. It shows strong correlations with genes like DNAJC3, PDIA3, and ISYNA1, which are involved in metabolic processes related to nucleosides. These interactions may have implications for cancer prognosis and treatment (Lu2024Prognostic).
