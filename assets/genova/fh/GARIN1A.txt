# GARIN1A

## Overview
GARIN1A is a gene that encodes the protein golgi associated RAB2 interactor 1A, which plays a crucial role in cellular processes related to the Golgi apparatus. This protein is involved in the regulation of vesicular trafficking, a fundamental process for maintaining cellular homeostasis and facilitating communication between different cellular compartments. As a Golgi-associated protein, it interacts with RAB2, a member of the RAB family of small GTPases, which are key regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking. The precise mechanisms by which GARIN1A influences these processes are still under investigation, but its involvement in the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway suggests a significant role in cellular signaling and regulation (Qiu2020aarFDC). Understanding the function and interactions of GARIN1A is essential for elucidating its potential implications in various diseases and developing targeted therapeutic strategies.
