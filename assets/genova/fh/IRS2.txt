# IRS2

## Overview
Insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2) is a gene that encodes a key adaptor protein involved in the insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling pathways. The IRS2 protein plays a pivotal role in regulating glucose metabolism and cellular growth processes. It is categorized as an adaptor protein due to its function in facilitating interactions between receptors and downstream signaling molecules. IRS2 is integral to the translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 to the cell surface, a critical step in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. It also participates in various signaling pathways, including the PI3K→PDK1→AKT and GRB2/SOS→RAS kinase cascades, which are essential for processes such as DNA repair, apoptosis, and cellular longevity (White2014IRS2). Beyond its metabolic functions, IRS2 is involved in pancreatic β-cell growth, central nervous system nutrient sensing, and endothelial cell function, highlighting its diverse roles in maintaining metabolic homeostasis and energy balance (White2014IRS2).

## Structure
IRS2 is a large protein with over 1,200 amino acid residues. It contains an amino-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, each approximately 100 amino acids in length. These domains are crucial for its interaction with the insulin receptor (IR), with the PH domain linking IRS2 to the activated IR and the PTB domain enhancing this interaction by binding to the phospho-NPEY motif within the IR juxtamembrane region (Copps2012Regulation). IRS2 also contains a unique kinase regulatory loop binding (KRLB) domain, which interacts directly with the catalytic site of IR (Copps2012Regulation).

The C-terminal tail of IRS2 is intrinsically disordered, allowing for dynamic interactions that facilitate the recruitment and activation of signaling effectors. This region includes a 174-amino-acid segment known as the invasion (INV) region, which is essential for promoting cell invasion but not for glucose uptake (MercadoMatos2018Identification). IRS2 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation on tyrosine residues, which is critical for the recruitment of downstream signaling molecules like PI3K (Peng2018IRS). Additionally, IRS2 can be acetylated, which impairs its insulin signaling capabilities by reducing tyrosine phosphorylation (Peng2018IRS).

## Function
IRS2 (insulin receptor substrate 2) is a critical adaptor protein in insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling pathways, playing a significant role in glucose metabolism and cellular growth processes. In healthy human cells, IRS2 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it facilitates downstream signaling cascades essential for maintaining metabolic homeostasis and energy balance. It is involved in the translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 to the cell surface, a crucial step in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, particularly in adipose tissue (Zhou1997Insulin).

IRS2 interacts with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), which is vital for the recruitment of GLUT4, and is part of two main signaling branches: the PI 3-kinase→PDK1→AKT and the GRB2/SOS→RAS kinase cascades. These pathways are involved in various cellular processes, including DNA damage repair, apoptosis, and longevity (White2014IRS2). IRS2 also plays a role in pancreatic β-cell growth and survival, central nervous system nutrient sensing, and endothelial cell function (White2014IRS2).

In the liver, IRS2 is crucial for regulating glucose and lipid metabolism, influencing processes like lipogenesis and gluconeogenesis. It helps maintain normal insulin signaling and metabolic homeostasis, impacting systemic glucose tolerance and preventing hyperglycemia (Taniguchi2005Complementary; Dong2006Irs1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression or function of the IRS2 gene are linked to several diseases and conditions. IRS2 plays a critical role in insulin signaling, and its dysfunction is associated with metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes. In mice, the disruption of IRS2 leads to impaired insulin signaling and pancreatic β-cell function, resulting in insulin resistance and progressive glucose intolerance, which are characteristic of type 2 diabetes (Sesti2001Defects; Withers1998Disruption). IRS2 is also implicated in cardiovascular diseases, with specific polymorphisms like Gly(1057)Asp associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease (Lavin2016IRS).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, altered IRS2 signaling is linked to Alzheimer's disease. Reduced IRS2 levels and increased serine phosphorylation of IRS proteins are observed in Alzheimer's patients, suggesting a connection to insulin resistance in the brain (Lavin2016IRS). Additionally, IRS2 is involved in diabetic complications such as diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy, where its altered expression contributes to retinal degeneration and neuronal dysfunction (Lavin2016IRS). These findings highlight the clinical significance of IRS2 in various diseases, emphasizing its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
IRS2 (insulin receptor substrate 2) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in insulin signaling pathways. IRS2 interacts with the insulin receptor (IR) and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) through its pleckstrin homology (PH) and phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains, which facilitate its recruitment to these receptors (Copps2012Regulation; Shaw2011The). The unique kinase regulatory loop binding (KRLB) domain of IRS2 interacts directly with the catalytic site of the IR, distinguishing its function from IRS1 (Copps2012Regulation).

IRS2 also plays a role in the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway by binding to the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K through its multiple PI3K binding motifs (Shaw2011The). This interaction is essential for the downstream activation of Akt, a key player in glucose metabolism and cell survival (White2002IRS).

Additionally, IRS2 is involved in forming a tertiary complex with JAK2 and SH2-B, which enhances the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS2 in response to leptin, promoting its interaction with other signaling molecules (Duan2004SH2B). These interactions highlight IRS2's role as a scaffold protein, organizing signaling complexes and facilitating various cellular processes.
