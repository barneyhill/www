# ZCCHC17

## Overview
ZCCHC17 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger CCHC-type containing 17 protein, also known as pNO40. This protein is a member of the zinc finger CCHC-type superfamily and is characterized by its involvement in RNA metabolism, particularly within the nucleolus. The protein features a CCHC-type zinc finger motif, an S1 RNA-binding domain, and clusters of basic amino acids that may function as a nucleolar targeting signal. ZCCHC17 plays a critical role in regulating ribosomal RNA (rRNA) biogenesis and mRNA processing, acting as a negative regulator of rDNA transcription and interacting with various splicing factors. It is implicated in several cellular processes, including RNA splicing and mRNA export, and has been identified as a master regulator of synaptic gene expression, particularly in the context of Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, alterations in ZCCHC17 expression have been associated with diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and hepatocellular carcinoma, highlighting its clinical significance (Bartosch2023ZCCHC17; Liu2022ZCCHC17; Wang2021The).

## Structure
ZCCHC17, also known as pNO40, is a protein that is part of the zinc finger CCHC-type superfamily. It is characterized by a CCHC-type zinc finger motif located in the middle of the protein, which is crucial for its function in nucleic acid binding (Wang2021The; AceitunoValenzuela2020Genomewide). The protein also contains an S1 RNA-binding domain at its N-terminus, which is involved in protein-protein interactions and RNA binding (Bartosch2023ZCCHC17; Wang2021The). At the C-terminus, ZCCHC17 has clusters of basic amino acids that may serve as a nucleolar targeting signal (Wang2021The).

The molecular structure of ZCCHC17 includes two nuclear localization signals, indicating its presence in the nucleus and nucleolus (Bartosch2023ZCCHC17). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including RNA splicing and mRNA export, and interacts with several splicing factors such as SRSF1 and SRSF2 (Bartosch2023ZCCHC17; Wang2021The). ZCCHC17's structure and interactions suggest its role as a master regulator of synaptic gene expression, particularly in the context of Alzheimer's disease (Tomljanovic2017ZCCHC17).

## Function
ZCCHC17, also known as pNO40, is a protein that plays a crucial role in RNA metabolism within healthy human cells. It is primarily located in the nucleolus and is involved in the regulation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) biogenesis as a core component of the 60S ribosomal subunit. The protein contains an S1 RNA binding region on its N-terminus, a CCHC-type zinc finger motif in the middle, and clusters of basic amino acids on its C-terminus, which may serve as a nucleolar targeting signal (Wang2021The). ZCCHC17 acts as a negative regulator of rDNA transcription by interacting with the upstream binding factor (UBF), reducing its binding to the rDNA promoter (Wang2021The).

ZCCHC17 also interacts with SR-family splicing factors, such as Pnn, and recruits them from nuclear speckles to nucleoli, contributing to rRNA splicing regulation. This interaction affects mRNA quality control, as overexpression of ZCCHC17 has been shown to reduce pre-mRNA splicing, poly(A)+ RNA nuclear export, and RNA polymerase II activity (Wang2021The; AceitunoValenzuela2020Genomewide). These functions highlight ZCCHC17's importance in maintaining proper RNA processing and export, which are essential for normal cellular functions related to protein synthesis and RNA metabolism.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the ZCCHC17 gene have been implicated in several diseases, notably Alzheimer's disease (AD) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In Alzheimer's disease, ZCCHC17 is identified as a master regulator of synaptic gene expression. Its dysfunction is associated with decreased expression of synaptic genes, contributing to synaptic dysfunction early in the disease process, even before significant neuronal loss or gliosis occurs (Bartosch2023ZCCHC17; Tomljanovic2017ZCCHC17). The decline in ZCCHC17 protein levels is linked to RNA splicing abnormalities and cognitive decline, suggesting that maintaining its function could support cognitive resilience in AD (Bartosch2023ZCCHC17; Cortese2024ZCCHC17).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, ZCCHC17 is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, likely due to abnormal methylation. This overexpression correlates with poor prognosis and is associated with various clinical features such as higher tumor mutational burden, microsatellite instability, and immune checkpoint gene expression (Liu2022ZCCHC17). High ZCCHC17 expression is linked to worse overall survival and progression-free survival, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker and its involvement in immune regulation within the tumor microenvironment (Liu2022ZCCHC17).

## Interactions
ZCCHC17, also known as pNO40, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in RNA metabolism. It interacts with the upstream binding factor (UBF), acting as a negative regulator of rDNA transcription by reducing UBF's binding to the rDNA promoter (Wang2021The). ZCCHC17 also binds to the splicing factor SRSF2, affecting the splicing process indirectly (Wang2021The). 

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, ZCCHC17 shares a substantial number of binding partners with tau, a protein associated with the disease. Approximately 55% of ZCCHC17 interactors are also tau interactors, including synaptic vesicle proteins, RNA splicing proteins, and RNA binding proteins (Bartosch2023ZCCHC17). This overlap suggests a potential role in synaptic dysfunction and RNA processing abnormalities observed in Alzheimer's disease (Bartosch2023ZCCHC17).

ZCCHC17 is also involved in interactions related to RNA processing pathways, such as RNA binding, RNA splicing, and nonsense-mediated decay. These interactions are crucial for maintaining synaptic function and cognitive resilience, particularly in the context of Alzheimer's disease (Bartosch2023ZCCHC17). The protein's interactions with transcription and splicing factors further support its role in regulating synaptic gene expression (Tomljanovic2017ZCCHC17).
