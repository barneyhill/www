# ARHGAP6

## Overview
ARHGAP6 is a gene that encodes the Rho GTPase activating protein 6, a member of the GTPase-activating protein family. This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton by specifically targeting RhoA, a member of the Rho family of GTPases, to modulate cell shape, motility, and division (Schaefer1997Cloning; Prakash2000Functional). The ARHGAP6 protein is characterized by a RhoGAP domain, which is essential for its function, and several proline-rich motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions (Prakash2000Functional). Beyond its role in cytoskeletal dynamics, ARHGAP6 is involved in cellular signaling pathways, including the enhancement of phospholipase C-δ1 activity, and has been implicated in various clinical conditions such as microphthalmia with linear skin defects, cardiac arrhythmias, and amelogenesis imperfecta (Hu2012Amelogenesis; Ochocka2008Regulation; Potet2009Genetic). Additionally, ARHGAP6 is associated with gastric signet-ring cell cancer through gene fusion events, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular functions and disease states (Shu2018Prognostic; Nakayama2019Enrichment).

## Structure
The ARHGAP6 protein is encoded by the ARHGAP6 gene and consists of 974 amino acids in its longest isoform. It features a RhoGAP domain, which spans amino acids 410-562, and is crucial for its function as a GTPase-activating protein specific for RhoA (Prakash2000Functional). The protein also contains three proline-rich motifs with putative SH3-binding sites, which are involved in protein-protein interactions (Prakash2000Functional). The C-terminal region of ARHGAP6 includes a polyproline motif and a segment homologous to the WASP protein family, sharing over 90% identity (Prakash2000Functional).

Alternative splicing of ARHGAP6 results in various isoforms, including a 771 amino acid version when exon 1a is spliced out, and truncations of the C-terminus by 338 or 249 amino acids if exons 11 and 12 are alternatively spliced (Prakash2000Functional). The N-terminal region is implicated in membrane interactions and signaling functions, containing a tyrosine phosphorylation site and several protein interaction motifs outside the RhoGAP domain (Prakash2000Functional). The protein's role in actin cytoskeleton remodeling is partly independent of its RhoGAP activity, indicating additional functions beyond GTPase activation (Prakash2000Functional).

## Function
ARHGAP6 encodes a GTPase-activating protein that specifically targets RhoA, a member of the Rho family of GTPases, but not Rac1 or Cdc42. This protein plays a crucial role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for maintaining cell shape, motility, and division (Schaefer1997Cloning; Prakash2000Functional). In healthy human cells, ARHGAP6 is involved in actin-cytoskeleton rearrangement by colocalizing with actin filaments and recruiting F-actin into growing processes (Ochocka2008Regulation). It promotes the extension of cytoplasmic processes and retraction of the cell body, leading to the disappearance of stress fibers and changes in cell morphology (Prakash2000Functional).

ARHGAP6 also enhances the activity of phospholipase C-δ1 (PLC-δ1) by increasing its Vmax, which suggests a role in cellular signaling pathways (Ochocka2008Regulation). The protein contains a rhoGAP domain and SH3-binding motifs, which are important for its function in signal transduction complexes at the plasma membrane (Schaefer1997Cloning). These activities highlight ARHGAP6's dual role as a GAP for RhoA and as a cytoskeletal protein facilitating actin remodeling (Prakash2000Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ARHGAP6 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions. ARHGAP6 is associated with microphthalmia with linear skin defects (MLS syndrome), an X-linked dominant disorder characterized by eye, skin, and central nervous system malformations, and potentially cardiac conduction disturbances. However, the loss of rhoGAP function of ARHGAP6 does not contribute to the MLS phenotype, suggesting other functions of ARHGAP6 may be involved (Potet2009Genetic).

In the context of cardiac function, ARHGAP6 acts as a negative regulator of the HERG channel, which is crucial for cardiac repolarization. Alterations in ARHGAP6 expression can affect HERG trafficking to the plasma membrane, potentially leading to cardiac arrhythmias and conditions like Long QT syndrome (LQTS) (Potet2009Genetic).

ARHGAP6 deletions have also been linked to amelogenesis imperfecta, a condition affecting enamel formation. In two families studied, deletions in ARHGAP6 that also affected the AMELX gene resulted in enamel malformations, indicating a genetic link between ARHGAP6 and dental phenotypes (Hu2012Amelogenesis).

Additionally, ARHGAP6 is involved in gastric signet-ring cell cancer through the CLDN18-ARHGAP6 fusion, which is associated with poor prognosis and chemotherapy resistance (Shu2018Prognostic; Nakayama2019Enrichment).

## Interactions
ARHGAP6 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It specifically interacts with RhoA, a member of the Rho GTPase family, to inactivate it, thereby preventing stress fiber formation in cells (Prakash2000Functional). ARHGAP6 does not activate Rac1 or Cdc42, indicating its specificity for RhoA (Prakash2000Functional).

ARHGAP6 also forms a complex with phospholipase C-δ1 (PLC-δ1), enhancing its activity. This interaction is specific, as ARHGAP6 does not interact with other phospholipase C isoforms like PLC-γ1 or PLC-β1 (Ochocka2008Regulation). The ARHGAP6/PLC-δ1 complex increases the Vmax of PLC-δ1, suggesting a role in actin-cytoskeleton rearrangement and potentially contributing to hypertension (Ochocka2008Regulation).

In addition, ARHGAP6 is involved in the regulation of the HERG potassium channel. It reduces HERG surface expression by affecting its trafficking to the plasma membrane, a process that is independent of its rhoGAP activity. This regulation involves the activation of PLC, which modulates PIP2 levels, impacting HERG localization (Potet2009Genetic). These interactions highlight ARHGAP6's multifaceted role in cellular signaling and structural dynamics.
