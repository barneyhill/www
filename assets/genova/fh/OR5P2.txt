# OR5P2

## Overview
OR5P2 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 5 subfamily P member 2, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This protein is primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a significant role in the olfactory system by initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell (Foster2014Extrasensory). While OR5P2 is predominantly expressed in the olfactory epithelium, it is also found in non-olfactory tissues such as the human retina, suggesting potential roles beyond traditional olfactory functions (enz2020chronic; Jovancevic2017Deep). The receptor's activity is associated with the plasma membrane, where it contributes to the initial stages of odor detection (Zhao2015Latent). Further research is required to fully understand the diverse functions of OR5P2 across different tissues.

## Structure


## Function
OR5P2 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein involved in the detection of odor molecules, contributing to the sense of smell. This receptor is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in olfactory signal transduction. Upon binding specific odorants, OR5P2 initiates a signal transduction pathway that results in the generation of neuronal action potentials, ultimately leading to the perception of smell (Foster2014Extrasensory).

In healthy human cells, OR5P2 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it is involved in olfactory transduction, a process related to the sensory perception of smell (Zhao2015Latent). The receptor's activity is associated with the plasma membrane and olfactory receptor activity, indicating its role in the initial stages of odor detection (Zhao2015Latent).

OR5P2 is also expressed in non-olfactory tissues, such as the human retina, where its specific function remains unclear. However, its presence suggests potential roles beyond traditional olfactory perception, possibly involving local stimulation or interactions with blood-borne ligands (enz2020chronic; Jovancevic2017Deep). Further research is needed to elucidate the full range of functions of OR5P2 in various tissues.
