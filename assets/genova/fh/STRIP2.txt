# STRIP2

## Overview
STRIP2, or striatin interacting protein 2, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is a critical component of the striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complex. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal organization, cell signaling, and cancer progression. As a regulatory protein, striatin interacting protein 2 plays a significant role in modulating key signaling pathways such as the Hippo and Wnt/β-catenin pathways, which are essential for cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. It also influences the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK MAPK signaling pathway, impacting cell proliferation and cancer development (Kück2019STRIPAK; Li2023Cellular). STRIP2's interactions within the STRIPAK complex and its involvement in chromatin acetylation processes underscore its importance in maintaining cellular integrity and function (Zhang2023STRIP2; Hwang2014STRIPAK). The gene's clinical significance is highlighted by its association with non-small cell lung cancer and potential implications in Tourette Syndrome, making it a subject of interest for further research in disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets (Zhang2023STRIP2; Eriguchi2017Identification).

## Function
STRIP2 (striatin interacting protein 2) is a component of the STRIPAK complex, a highly conserved signaling complex involved in various cellular and developmental processes. In healthy human cells, STRIP2 interacts with striatins, which are regulatory subunits of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complex, playing a crucial role in transmitting extracellular signals to mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades (Kück2019STRIPAK). STRIP2 is involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal organization, affecting cell morphology and migration. Its depletion can lead to altered microtubule organization and cell elongation, indicating its role in maintaining cytoskeletal integrity (Hwang2014STRIPAK).

STRIP2 is also implicated in the regulation of key signaling pathways, including the Hippo and Wnt/β-catenin pathways, which are essential for cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. It acts as a positive regulator in the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK MAPK signaling pathway, influencing cell proliferation and cancer development (Li2023Cellular). Additionally, STRIP2 is involved in the regulation of vascular smooth muscle cell behavior through the P38 MAPK signaling pathway, affecting processes like cell proliferation and migration (Dai2019STRIP2). These functions highlight STRIP2's role in cellular signaling and structural organization.

## Clinical Significance
The STRIP2 gene has been implicated in the progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). High expression levels of STRIP2 in NSCLC tissues are associated with poor tumor differentiation, advanced TNM stage, lymph node metastasis, and cancer thrombus. Patients with elevated STRIP2 expression exhibit shorter overall and recurrence-free survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker. The gene's overexpression enhances cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while its knockdown suppresses these tumorigenic phenotypes, indicating its role in cancer progression (Zhang2023STRIP2).

STRIP2 interacts with IGF2BP3 to stabilize TMBIM6 mRNA, contributing to NSCLC progression. This interaction is crucial for the oncogenic effects of STRIP2, as IGF2BP3 knockdown negates these effects. The STRIP2-IGF2BP3 axis enhances TMBIM6 mRNA stability through m6A modification, promoting cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (Zhang2023STRIP2).

In Tourette Syndrome (TS), STRIP2 mutations have been identified, although they are not classified as hazardous. The gene's expression is significantly upregulated in the striatum compared to other brain regions, and lower expression levels are observed in TS patients, suggesting a potential link to the disorder (Eriguchi2017Identification).

## Interactions
STRIP2 (striatin interacting protein 2) is involved in various protein interactions, primarily as part of the striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complex. Within this complex, STRIP2 interacts with proteins such as PP2A, Mob3, and germinal center kinases (GCKs) through adaptor proteins. STRIP2, along with its paralog STRIP1, can associate with PP2Ac, although isoform 2 of STRIP2 lacks the C terminus necessary for this association (Tang2019Architecture; Hwang2014STRIPAK).

In the context of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), STRIP2 interacts directly with insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3). This interaction is crucial for the stabilization of TMBIM6 mRNA, which is enhanced through m6A modifications, promoting cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Zhang2023STRIP2). The interaction between STRIP2 and IGF2BP3 involves specific domains within each protein, with STRIP2 interacting through its 339-834 nt region and IGF2BP3 through its KH1 and KH2 domains (Zhang2023STRIP2).

STRIP2 is also implicated in chromatin acetylation processes, potentially regulated by H3K27 acetylation in its promoter region, catalyzed by the P300/CBP complex (Zhang2023STRIP2). These interactions highlight STRIP2's role in cellular signaling and cancer progression.
