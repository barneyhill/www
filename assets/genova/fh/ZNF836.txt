# ZNF836

## Overview
ZNF836 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 836, a member of the zinc finger protein family known for their role as transcription factors. These proteins are characterized by zinc finger motifs that facilitate DNA binding, allowing them to regulate gene expression by interacting with specific DNA sequences. Zinc finger protein 836 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it plays a significant role in cellular processes such as differentiation and development by modulating the transcription of target genes. The gene's involvement in various cellular pathways underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and organismal development. Additionally, ZNF836 has been implicated in certain pathological conditions, including its interaction with long noncoding RNAs in cancer and its involvement in fusion events in leukemia, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Severgnini2022Conjoined; Gao2020Identification; Perdomo-Sabogal2019Genetic).

## Function
ZNF836 is a member of the zinc finger protein family, characterized by zinc finger motifs that enable DNA binding. These proteins typically function as transcription factors, playing a crucial role in regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. ZNF836 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and development, by modulating the transcription of target genes. It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences the transcriptional landscape of the cell. Through its activity as a transcription factor, ZNF836 contributes to the precise control of gene expression necessary for maintaining normal cellular functions and organismal development. The protein's ability to bind DNA and regulate transcription underscores its importance in the complex network of gene regulation that governs cellular behavior and physiological outcomes.

## Interactions
ZNF836 is a zinc finger protein that participates in various interactions, primarily functioning as a transcription factor. In the context of Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma (UCEC), ZNF836 is identified as one of the top five binding proteins interacting with the long noncoding RNA RP11-357H14.17. This interaction suggests a role in the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network, which may influence gene expression and cancer progression (Gao2020Identification).

In pediatric B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL), ZNF836 is involved in an inter-chromosomal fusion event with DCAF8, identified as DCAF8::ZNF836. This fusion event is part of a broader study on conjoined genes and fusion events in leukemia, although specific details about the functional implications of this interaction are not provided (Severgnini2022Conjoined).

While ZNF836 is mentioned in the context of genetic variation and selection in human populations, specific interactions with proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed in these studies. The focus is more on the evolutionary aspects and potential local adaptation roles of zinc finger proteins, including ZNF836 (Perdomo-Sabogal2019Genetic).
