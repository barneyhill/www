# VSTM2B

## Overview
VSTM2B is a gene that encodes the V-set and transmembrane domain containing 2B protein, which is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. This protein is characterized by the presence of a V-set domain, commonly associated with immune functions, and a transmembrane domain, indicating its potential role in cellular signaling pathways. The VSTM2B protein is involved in various cellular processes, and its function may be modulated by post-translational modifications such as glycosylation. These modifications can affect the protein's stability, localization, and interaction capabilities, which are crucial for its role in cell signaling. While the structural details of VSTM2B are not fully elucidated, its involvement in neurological and oncological conditions highlights its clinical significance and potential as a biomarker in diseases such as genetic frontotemporal dementia and breast cancer (van2019Novel; Han2020Proteomic; TrasierrasFresco2022DNA).

## Structure
The VSTM2B gene encodes a protein that is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily, characterized by the presence of a V-set domain. This domain is a common feature in proteins involved in immune functions and is integral to the protein's role in various cellular processes. The VSTM2B protein also includes a transmembrane domain, suggesting its localization within cellular membranes and potential involvement in signaling pathways.

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are likely to occur in the VSTM2B protein, which may influence its stability, localization, and function. These modifications are typical for proteins with roles in cell signaling and interaction, enhancing their functional diversity.

Information on splice variant isoforms of VSTM2B is limited, indicating that further research may be needed to fully understand the diversity and functional implications of these variants. Detailed structural data, including secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, are not extensively documented, which suggests that the protein's precise molecular architecture remains to be elucidated through future studies.

## Clinical Significance
VSTM2B has been implicated in several neurological and oncological conditions due to alterations in its expression levels. In genetic frontotemporal dementia (FTD), VSTM2B concentrations are significantly lower in symptomatic GRN and C9orf72 mutation carriers compared to noncarriers, suggesting its potential role as a biomarker for the disease (van2019Novel). However, in presymptomatic carriers, these differences are not statistically significant, indicating that VSTM2B alterations may be more relevant in the symptomatic phase of the disease (van2019Novel).

In the context of postoperative delirium (POD), VSTM2B levels in cerebrospinal fluid have shown a significant correlation with the severity of POD, as measured by MDAS scores. This suggests that VSTM2B may be involved in the pathological mechanisms underlying POD and could serve as a biomarker for assessing the risk or severity of this condition (Han2020Proteomic).

In cancer research, VSTM2B has been noted for its hypermethylation in breast cancer, which might suggest a better prognosis for patients. This hypermethylation pattern indicates a potential role for VSTM2B in cancer prognosis, although the specific clinical implications require further investigation (TrasierrasFresco2022DNA).
