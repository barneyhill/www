# RBM27

## Overview
RBM27 (RNA binding motif protein 27) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in RNA metabolism, specifically in the PAXT-mediated nuclear RNA decay pathway. The protein, RNA binding motif protein 27, is categorized as an RNA-binding protein and plays a crucial role in the degradation of nuclear polyadenylated RNA (pA+ RNA) in human cells. It functions as a key component of the PAXT complex, interacting with other proteins such as ZC3H3 and PABPN1 to facilitate RNA turnover and maintain RNA homeostasis within the nucleus (Silla2020The). The RBM27 protein is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it forms part of a higher-order protein assembly that is essential for recruiting the RNA exosome to its substrates, ensuring efficient RNA processing and decay (Silla2020The). Mutations in the RBM27 gene have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism, and its dysregulation is implicated in cancer pathogenesis, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease (Chowdhury2023Autism; Wei2022Comprehensive).

## Function
RBM27 (RNA binding motif protein 27) is a critical component of the PAXT-mediated nuclear RNA decay pathway, which is essential for the degradation of nuclear polyadenylated RNA (pA+ RNA) in human cells. It interacts with components of the PAXT complex, including ZC3H3 and the RNA exosome core, to facilitate the turnover of these RNAs, thereby maintaining RNA homeostasis within the nucleus (Silla2020The). RBM27, along with its paralog RBM26, acts redundantly in this process, and their depletion leads to the upregulation of specific PAXT-sensitive transcripts, indicating their role in targeting these RNAs for decay (Silla2020The).

RBM27 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it forms part of a higher-order protein assembly that includes PABPN1 and ZC3H3, which is analogous to the MTREC complex found in other species like S. pombe (Silla2020The). This assembly is crucial for the recruitment of the RNA exosome to its substrates, ensuring efficient RNA processing and decay. The protein's interactions and functions highlight its importance in regulating gene expression and maintaining cellular homeostasis through RNA decay mechanisms (Silla2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the RBM27 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer. In the context of autism, RBM27 is identified as a candidate gene due to the presence of de novo missense variants in individuals with autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders. These variants are not found in unaffected siblings, suggesting a potential link to the disorder. The mutations, such as L13V and P79L, are believed to disrupt the gene's function, leading to decreased protein expression and defects in axon development, which may contribute to autism (Chowdhury2023Autism).

RBM27 is also involved in PAXT-mediated nuclear RNA decay, and its interactions with components of the PAXT complex are crucial for RNA processing. Disruptions in these interactions, such as through depletion of RBM27, can lead to the upregulation of certain RNA transcripts, indicating its role in maintaining RNA stability. This dysregulation may have implications for diseases where RNA processing is affected (Silla2020The).

In cancer, RBM27 is among the genes affected by 3′-UTR piSNVs, which can alter miRNA binding and contribute to posttranscriptional impairment. This dysregulation is associated with abnormal miRNA expression patterns in various cancers, highlighting RBM27's potential role in cancer pathogenesis (Wei2022Comprehensive).

## Interactions
RBM27 is involved in PAXT-mediated nuclear RNA decay and interacts with several proteins to form multiprotein complexes. It associates with its paralog RBM26, ZC3H3, and PABPN1, linking them to a fraction of the MTR4-ZFC3H1 dimer, which suggests their assembly with the PAXT complex and the RNA exosome (Silla2020The). RBM27 is enriched in nuclear polyadenylated RNA-bound proteomes upon exosome depletion, indicating its role in RNA metabolism. It is considered a principal component of the PAXT complex, with RBM26 functioning in a partially redundant manner (Silla2020The).

RBM27 interacts with MTR4, PABPN1, and ZC3H3, forming a sub-module similar to the MTREC complex in S. pombe. This interaction is enhanced when ZCCHC8 is depleted, which increases the interaction of MTR4 with PAXT components (Silla2020The). The depletion of RBM27, along with ZC3H3 and RBM26, leads to the upregulation of certain long non-coding RNAs, highlighting their role as nuclear exosome co-factors (Silla2020The). These interactions underscore RBM27's significant role in RNA decay processes and its involvement in complex formation with other proteins.
