# MAP3K13

## Overview
MAP3K13 is a gene that encodes the protein mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 13, also known as leucine zipper-bearing kinase (LZK). This protein is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a pivotal role in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, which are integral to various cellular processes, including growth, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. MAP3K13 is characterized by its leucine zipper domain, which facilitates dimerization, and a kinase domain that is essential for its enzymatic activity. The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cell survival and differentiation by activating downstream kinases. MAP3K13 is involved in the regulation of the NF-κB and JNK signaling pathways, which are crucial for cellular responses to stress and inflammation. Its activity is significant in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental stimuli, and it has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in these signaling pathways (Köster2024Regulation; Nguyen2022MAP3K).

## Structure
MAP3K13, also known as leucine zipper-bearing kinase (LZK), is a serine/threonine kinase involved in the MAPK signaling pathway. The protein structure of MAP3K13 includes a leucine zipper domain, which facilitates dimerization, and a kinase domain responsible for its enzymatic activity (Köster2024Regulation). The leucine zipper domain is crucial for the homodimerization process, which is a key aspect of its activation mechanism (Köster2024Regulation).

MAP3K13 lacks an N-terminal SH3 domain and a CRIB motif, which distinguishes it from other kinases in the MLK subfamily (Rattanasinchai2016MLK3). Instead, it features two leucine zipper motifs separated by a short spacer, and its C-terminal region is proline-rich, although the function of this region remains unknown (Rattanasinchai2016MLK3). The protein is heavily phosphorylated, a post-translational modification that regulates its activity (Köster2024Regulation).

Alternative splicing of MAP3K13 may produce different isoforms, potentially affecting its function and interactions (Köster2024Regulation). However, specific details about the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of MAP3K13 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
MAP3K13, also known as leucine zipper-bearing kinase (LZK), is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a significant role in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, which are crucial for linking extracellular signals to various cellular processes such as growth, proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis (Nguyen2022MAP3K). In healthy human cells, MAP3K13 is involved in the regulation of the NF-κB and JNK signaling pathways, which are essential for cellular responses to stress and inflammation (Nguyen2022MAP3K). 

MAP3K13 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it activates downstream kinases, influencing cell survival and differentiation (Nguyen2022MAP3K). It has been identified as a novel positive regulator of axon growth, indicating its involvement in neuronal development and function (Nguyen2022MAP3K). The kinase recognition motif of MAP3K13 is conserved across species, suggesting its functional significance in phosphorylation processes, which are essential for signal transduction and cellular responses (Cho2006Genetic). 

Overall, MAP3K13's activity in the MAPK signaling pathway underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental stimuli.

## Clinical Significance
MAP3K13, also known as leucine zipper-bearing kinase (LZK), has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in the MAPK signaling pathway. In hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer (HR+ HER2- BC), acquired mutations in MAP3K13 are associated with worse clinical outcomes, including shorter disease-free survival and overall survival. These mutations are often detected in metastatic breast cancer samples but not in early-stage samples, indicating their role in cancer progression and treatment resistance (Ferrando2023ESR1).

In colon cancer, MAP3K13 is involved in the miR-4500/MAP3K13 pathway, where it is regulated by the long noncoding RNA LINC01287. LINC01287 acts as a molecular sponge for miR-4500, leading to increased MAP3K13 expression, which promotes cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This pathway highlights MAP3K13's oncogenic role in colon cancer, suggesting it as a potential therapeutic target (Fu2021LINC01287).

Despite its involvement in cancer, a study on BRCA1/2-negative Chilean families found no significant association between breast cancer risk and single-nucleotide polymorphisms in MAP3K13, indicating that its role may vary across different genetic backgrounds (MoralesPison2023Association).

## Interactions
MAP3K13, also known as leucine zipper-bearing kinase (LZK), is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. It is a member of the MLK family and plays a role in regulating the NF-κB and JNK signaling pathways, which are associated with cancer progression (Nguyen2022MAP3K). In breast cancer, MAP3K13 overexpression stabilizes and enhances the transcriptional activity of the Myc oncogene, contributing to poor patient survival. This overexpression also promotes cancer cell viability and proliferation by maintaining the expression of gain-of-function mutant p53 (Nguyen2022MAP3K).

In colon cancer, MAP3K13 is regulated by the long non-coding RNA LINC01287 through its interaction with miR-4500. LINC01287 acts as a molecular sponge for miR-4500, reducing its levels and thereby upregulating MAP3K13 expression. This interaction is confirmed through luciferase reporter assays and RNA pull-down assays, which demonstrate that miR-4500 directly targets MAP3K13 (Fu2021LINC01287). The upregulation of MAP3K13 by LINC01287 leads to the activation of NF-κB signaling, influencing colon cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Fu2021LINC01287).
