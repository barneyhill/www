# OR52B2

## Overview
OR52B2 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 52 subfamily B member 2, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This protein functions primarily as an olfactory receptor, playing a critical role in the detection of odor molecules and the initiation of signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. While OR52B2 is predominantly active in the olfactory epithelium, it is also expressed in non-olfactory tissues, such as the kidney and skin, where it may influence processes like bicarbonate secretion and skin barrier function (Zhang2007Characterizing; Beito2024Role; Kang2021UVIrradiation). The gene's expression in diverse tissues suggests that OR52B2 may have broader physiological roles beyond olfaction, potentially impacting systemic metabolism and other organ systems (Santos2019The).

## Function
OR52B2 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein involved in the detection of odor molecules. This receptor is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. OR52B2 is primarily active in the olfactory epithelium, where it contributes to the diversity of odor detection and olfactory signaling (Zhang2007Characterizing).

In addition to its role in olfaction, OR52B2 has been implicated in other physiological processes. It is expressed in non-olfactory tissues, such as the kidney, where it is involved in the regulation of bicarbonate secretion in the proximal tubule, potentially influencing metabolic acidosis (Beito2024Role). OR52B2 is also upregulated in human keratinocytes under conditions of UVB irradiation and inflammation, suggesting a role in skin barrier function (Kang2021UVIrradiation).

The receptor's expression in various tissues indicates that OR52B2 may have broader implications beyond olfaction, potentially influencing systemic metabolism and physiological processes in different organ systems (Santos2019The).

## Clinical Significance
The OR52B2 gene has been implicated in various health conditions through its genetic variants and alterations in expression. In the context of developmental language disorders (DLD), genome-wide exome sequencing has identified a stop-gain variant in OR52B2 in a proband, suggesting a potential link between this gene and language impairments (van2024Genetic). However, the specific role of OR52B2 in these disorders remains unclear, as the excerpt does not provide detailed information on its direct involvement.

In thyroid cancer, OR52B2 has been included in a prognostic classifier based on DNA methylation profiles. This classifier distinguishes between well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas with good and poor prognoses, demonstrating 63% sensitivity and 92% specificity. The inclusion of OR52B2 in this classifier highlights its potential role as a biomarker for aggressive thyroid cancer subtypes (Bisarro2017Prognostic).

Additionally, OR52B2 has been identified as a gene under selection in the East Asian population, indicating its evolutionary significance. However, the specific health implications of this selection remain to be fully understood (Racimo2015Testing). Overall, while OR52B2 is associated with certain conditions, further research is needed to elucidate its clinical significance fully.
