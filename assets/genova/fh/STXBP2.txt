# STXBP2

## Overview
STXBP2, or syntaxin binding protein 2, is a gene that encodes the protein Munc18-2, a member of the Sec1/Munc18-like protein family. This protein plays a pivotal role in the immune system by facilitating the docking and fusion of lytic vesicles at the cell membrane, particularly in cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. Munc18-2 is essential for the exocytosis of cytotoxic granules, which are crucial for the immune response against infected or malignant cells. The protein interacts with syntaxin 11, a SNARE protein, to mediate this process. Mutations in the STXBP2 gene are linked to familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis type 5 (FHL5), a severe immune disorder characterized by impaired cytotoxic function and excessive inflammation (zur2009Familial; ViñasGiménez2019Molecular).

## Structure
The STXBP2 gene encodes the protein Munc18-2, which is part of the Sec1/Munc18-like protein family. This protein is crucial for the docking and fusion of lytic vesicles at the cell membrane, particularly in cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells (ViñasGiménez2019Molecular). Munc18-2 is composed of 593 amino acids and includes a large Sec1 domain (zur2009Familial). The protein structure is organized into three domains that are specifically involved in the granule fusion process. When the cytotoxic cell is polarized, Munc18-2 adopts an arch-shaped structure formed by these domains, which is essential for its function in membrane fusion (ViñasGiménez2019Molecular).

The central cavity of Munc18-2, formed by domains 1 and 3, is involved in binding to Syntaxin 11 and the exocytic SNARE complex, facilitating membrane fusion (ViñasGiménez2019Molecular). The protein's tertiary structure is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions, as seen with the highly conserved L243 residue, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of domains 2 and 3 (ViñasGiménez2019Molecular). Munc18-2 can also act as a chaperone for monomeric Syntaxin 11, aiding its transport to the plasma membrane (Benavides2020STXBP2R190C).

## Function
STXBP2, also known as syntaxin binding protein 2 or Munc18-2, is crucial for the cytotoxic function of immune cells, particularly natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). It plays a significant role in the docking and fusion of lytic vesicles at the cell membrane, a process essential for the degranulation mechanism that contributes to immune responses (ViñasGiménez2019Molecular). STXBP2 interacts with syntaxin 11, a SNARE protein, to facilitate the exocytosis of cytotoxic granules, which contain perforin and granzymes necessary for inducing apoptosis in target cells (Côte2009Munc182; zur2009Familial).

In healthy human cells, STXBP2 is predominantly localized on secretory lysosomes of CTLs, with lower levels on the plasma membrane, suggesting its role in delivering STX11 to the plasma membrane (ViñasGiménez2019Molecular). The protein is involved in the late steps of the secretory pathway, specifically in the release of cytotoxic granules, by binding to syntaxin-11, which is crucial for the proper exocytosis of these granules (Côte2009Munc182). This interaction is vital for maintaining the stability and function of protein complexes essential for effective cytotoxic responses in immune cells (Lopez2018BiAllelic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the STXBP2 gene are associated with familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis type 5 (FHL5), a severe immune disorder characterized by excessive immune activation and inflammation. FHL5 is caused by mutations that impair the binding of STXBP2 to syntaxin 11, which is crucial for cytotoxic granule release in natural killer (NK) and T cells. This impairment leads to reduced amounts of STXBP2 and syntaxin 11, resulting in defective cytotoxic activity and hyperinflammatory symptoms such as prolonged fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and cytopenia (Côte2009Munc182; zur2009Familial).

The mutations identified in STXBP2 include missense mutations, deletions, and splice-site mutations, which can lead to early-onset disease diagnosed before one year of age. These genetic alterations result in impaired NK and T cell function, similar to defects observed in patients with syntaxin-11 deficiency (Côte2009Munc182; zur2009Familial). The absence of functional STXBP2 destabilizes syntaxin 11, affecting the granule exocytosis machinery and leading to immune dysregulation (zur2009Familial).

Patients with FHL5 may also exhibit atypical features such as sensorineural hearing deficits, abnormal bleeding, and severe diarrhea, indicating a genotype-phenotype correlation and extending the clinical spectrum of the disorder (Pagel2012Distinct).

## Interactions
STXBP2, also known as syntaxin binding protein 2 or Munc18-2, is involved in critical protein interactions that regulate vesicle-mediated transport and membrane fusion processes. It primarily interacts with syntaxin 11, a member of the SNARE protein family, which is essential for the exocytosis of cytotoxic granules in natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) (Côte2009Munc182; zur2009Familial). This interaction is crucial for the stability and function of both proteins, as mutations in STXBP2 can disrupt this binding, leading to impaired immune cell function (zur2009Familial).

STXBP2 also interacts with other syntaxin proteins, such as STX3, and is part of the Sec1/Munc18 protein family, which includes STXBP1 and STXBP3. These proteins are involved in the docking and fusion of secretory vesicles at the plasma membrane (Lopez2018BiAllelic; Benavides2020STXBP2R190C). The interaction between STXBP2 and syntaxin 11 is particularly significant in hematopoietic cells, where it facilitates the late steps of the secretory pathway, enabling the release of cytotoxic granules (Côte2009Munc182). The functional interdependency between STXBP2 and other syntaxin proteins underscores its role in maintaining immune cell cytotoxicity and overall immune response (Lopez2018BiAllelic).
