# HOXB8

## Overview
The HOXB8 gene encodes the homeobox B8 protein, a transcription factor belonging to the homeobox gene family, which is characterized by a conserved DNA-binding domain known as the homeodomain. This protein plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression during development and cellular differentiation. As a transcription factor, homeobox B8 is involved in various biological processes, including the regulation of smooth muscle and myeloid cell functions, as well as influencing immune responses and tumorigenesis. The protein's ability to form heterodimers with Pbx proteins enhances its DNA-binding specificity and regulatory capabilities (Neuteboom1995The). Dysregulation of HOXB8 has been implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders and cancers, highlighting its clinical significance in both developmental biology and disease pathology (Bondos2020Contextdependent; Nagarajan2017Corticostriatal).

## Structure
The HOXB8 protein is characterized by a conserved homeodomain, a 60-amino acid DNA-binding motif consisting of three α-helices, which is crucial for its function as a transcription factor (ElMounayri2005Regulation). The primary structure of HOXB8 includes a hexapeptide sequence, LFPWMR, which is essential for cooperative DNA binding with Pbx1 and Pbx2 proteins (Neuteboom1995The). This hexapeptide is connected to the homeodomain by a linker of variable length, and its position relative to the homeodomain is important for DNA binding cooperativity (Neuteboom1995The).

The secondary structure of the HOXB8 protein involves helix-turn-helix motifs, typical of homeodomain proteins, which facilitate DNA binding (ElMounayri2005Regulation). Molecular dynamics simulations have shown that the hexapeptide can form stable folded structures in water, with a type I β-turn conformation being predominant in the trans isomer (Rundgren2007Molecular).

Post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination, affect the stability and degradation of HOXB8, with interactions involving CUL-4A leading to proteasomal degradation (Draime2018Posttranslational). These modifications are crucial for regulating the protein's function and stability. The presence of splice variant isoforms of HOXB8 has not been detailed in the available context.

## Function
HOXB8 is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in regulating gene expression in smooth muscle cells and myeloid cells. In smooth muscle tissues, HOXB8 is involved in repressing the activity of several smooth muscle-specific promoters, such as those for telokin, smooth muscle α-actin, and SM22α. This repression is achieved through competition with other homeodomain protein activators or by recruiting corepressor molecules via interaction with Pbx (ElMounayri2005Regulation). The expression of HOXB8 in smooth muscle cells suggests it may influence smooth muscle function and development by modulating the balance of gene activation and repression (ElMounayri2005Regulation).

In the context of myeloid cells, HOXB8 is crucial for maintaining cell proliferation and survival, particularly in response to interleukin-3 (IL-3) signaling. It supports the survival and proliferation of IL-3-dependent myeloid cell lines by repressing the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins like Bim, thereby preventing apoptosis (Salmanidis2013Hoxb8). HOXB8 also regulates the expression of microRNAs, such as the miR-17B92 cluster, which further modulates cell death and differentiation pathways (Salmanidis2013Hoxb8).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and dysregulation of the HOXB8 gene have been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders and cancers. In mice, mutations in HOXB8 result in behavioral abnormalities such as hyperanxiety, social impairments, and compulsive grooming behaviors, which are similar to human obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) spectrum disorders, particularly trichotillomania (Nagarajan2017Corticostriatal). These behavioral changes are linked to synaptic and physiological defects within the corticostriatal circuit, including increased cortical synapse and spine density and changes in synaptic plasticity (Nagarajan2017Corticostriatal). The study suggests that defective microglia, which are the only cells in the mouse brain labeled with the Hoxb8 cell lineage, may cause these neuropsychiatric disorders (Nagarajan2017Corticostriatal).

In cancer, HOXB8 expression has been associated with promoting proliferation, migration, and invasion in osteosarcoma cell cultures. It is required for the creation of tumor xenografts in mice, primarily through the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Knockdown of HOXB8 suppresses cell proliferation and reduces tumor growth, indicating its role in tumorigenic processes (Bondos2020Contextdependent). Additionally, over-expression of HOXB8 in transgenic mouse embryos has been linked to vertebral defects, suggesting a potential role in the pathogenesis of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) (Fendri2013Microarray).

## Interactions
HOXB8 is a transcription factor that interacts with other proteins and nucleic acids to regulate gene expression. It forms heterodimers with Pbx proteins, such as Pbx-1 and Pbx-2, which significantly enhance its DNA binding affinity and specificity. These interactions are facilitated by a conserved hexapeptide, LFPWMR, located N-terminal to the homeodomain of HOXB8. This hexapeptide is crucial for cooperative DNA binding with Pbx proteins, although the homeodomain also plays a critical role in these interactions (Neuteboom1995The).

HOXB8/Pbx-1 heterodimers undergo conformational changes upon binding to specific DNA sequences, as evidenced by shifts in fluorescence emission and circular dichroism spectroscopy. These changes are not observed with nonspecific DNA, indicating the specificity of the interaction (Sánchez1997Conformational). In smooth muscle cells, HOXB8 binds to AT-rich regions in the telokin promoter, competing with other homeodomain proteins like Hoxa10-1, and represses promoter activity (ElMounayri2005Regulation).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, HOXB8 is involved in immune response regulation and binds to promoters of genes like CD24 and LGR5, indicating its role in tumor stem cells (BertonnierBrouty2024HOXB6).
