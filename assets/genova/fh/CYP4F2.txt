# CYP4F2

## Overview
CYP4F2 is a gene that encodes the enzyme cytochrome P450 family 4 subfamily F member 2, a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes. This enzyme is primarily expressed in the liver and kidneys and plays a significant role in the metabolism of various substrates, including long-chain fatty acids, vitamins K and E, and arachidonic acid. As a heme-thiolate protein, CYP4F2 is involved in NADPH-dependent oxidation processes, contributing to the regulation of blood pressure and the metabolism of essential vitamins and fatty acids (Alvarellos2015PharmGKB; Edson2013Cytochrome). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining physiological homeostasis, and genetic variations in CYP4F2 have been linked to clinical conditions such as hypertension, altered warfarin dose requirements, and cardiovascular diseases (Geng2019Association; van2016CYP4F2).

## Structure
The CYP4F2 protein is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, which are heme-thiolate proteins involved in various metabolic processes. The primary structure of CYP4F2 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its higher-order structures. The secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which contribute to the protein's overall stability and function (Kim2018Identification). The tertiary structure of CYP4F2 forms a compact, globular shape with a heme-binding domain, essential for its enzymatic activity (Kim2018Identification). 

While specific details on the quaternary structure of CYP4F2 are not provided, it is generally understood that cytochrome P450 enzymes can function as monomers. The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation, which can affect its activity and stability (Jarrar2019Molecular). 

Splice variant isoforms of CYP4F2 may exist, resulting in proteins with varied functions, although specific isoforms are not detailed in the available context (Jarrar2019Molecular). The protein's structure is crucial for its role in metabolizing fatty acids, therapeutic drugs, and signaling molecules, including vitamin K (FarajzadehDehkordi2023Computational).

## Function
The CYP4F2 gene encodes an enzyme that is part of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, primarily expressed in the liver and kidneys. This enzyme is involved in the NADPH-dependent oxidation of various substrates, including long and very long-chain fatty acids, vitamin K, vitamin E, arachidonic acid (AA), and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) (Alvarellos2015PharmGKB). It plays a critical role in the metabolism of vitamin E and vitamin K by ω-hydroxylating these vitamins, which is essential for modulating their circulating plasma levels (Alvarellos2015PharmGKB). 

CYP4F2 catalyzes the synthesis of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) from AA, a process that influences vasoconstriction and natriuresis, thereby affecting blood pressure regulation (Alvarellos2015PharmGKB). The enzyme also contributes to fatty acid metabolism by catalyzing the ω-oxidation and chain shortening of very long-chain fatty acids, especially during fasting or when β-oxidation is impaired (Alvarellos2015PharmGKB). 

In the context of vitamin K metabolism, CYP4F2 is involved in the ω-hydroxylation of menaquinone-4 (MK4), a process crucial for the activation of clotting factors in the liver (Edson2013Cytochrome). This activity is important for maintaining proper levels of vitamin K, necessary for the γ-carboxylation of Gla proteins involved in blood clotting (Edson2013Cytochrome).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the CYP4F2 gene have been associated with several clinical conditions. The rs2108622 polymorphism, which results in a valine to methionine substitution (p.V433M), is linked to an increased risk of cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) in Caucasian males. This variant reduces the clearance of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) by decreasing their ω-oxidation, due to lower CYP4F2 protein levels (van2016CYP4F2).

CYP4F2 polymorphisms, including rs2108622 and rs1558139, have been associated with hypertension. The rs2108622 variant affects the production of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), a metabolite involved in blood pressure regulation, leading to increased hypertension risk (Geng2019Association). The rs2108622 polymorphism is also linked to increased warfarin dose requirements due to its impact on vitamin K metabolism (Jarrar2019Molecular).

Additionally, CYP4F2 variants have been implicated in cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary artery disease and ischemic stroke, particularly in specific populations (Wu2019Genetic). The gene's role in metabolizing arachidonic acid to 20-HETE is crucial for vascular function, and alterations can contribute to disease susceptibility (Stec2007Functional).
