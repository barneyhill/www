# DIAPH3

## Overview
DIAPH3 is a gene that encodes the protein diaphanous-related formin 3, a member of the formin family of proteins. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, playing a critical role in actin nucleation and elongation, which are essential processes for maintaining cell shape, division, and motility (Chesarone2009Unleashing; Stastna2011Differing). Diaphanous-related formin 3 is characterized by its formin homology domains, FH1 and FH2, which facilitate actin polymerization and interact with profilin-actin complexes to enhance filament elongation (Stastna2011Differing). The protein also contains regulatory domains that interact with Rho family GTPases, modulating its activity in response to cellular signals (Shah2024The). DIAPH3 is implicated in various cellular processes, including cytokinesis and microtubule stability, and its dysregulation is associated with several clinical conditions, such as auditory neuropathy and certain cancers (Kazama2020Loss; LabatdeHoz2021Formins).

## Structure
The DIAPH3 protein is a member of the formin family, characterized by its involvement in actin nucleation and elongation. It contains several key domains, including the formin homology 1 (FH1) and formin homology 2 (FH2) domains, which are crucial for actin polymerization. The FH2 domain facilitates the elongation of F-actin filaments from the barbed end, while the adjacent FH1 domain recruits profilin-actin complexes to enhance this process (Stastna2011Differing). DIAPH3 also features a diaphanous autoregulatory domain (DAD) and a diaphanous inhibitory domain (DID), which are involved in autoinhibition. This autoinhibition is relieved through interactions with Rho family GTPases, allowing actin monomer access to the FH2 domain (Shah2024The).

DIAPH3 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms with distinct functions. Isoform 1 is associated with plasma membrane blebbing, while isoform 7 is linked to filopodia formation (Stastna2011Differing). The GTPase-binding domain (GBD) and FH3 region are critical for determining the subcellular localization and protrusion specificity of these isoforms (Stastna2011Differing). Despite these functional insights, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of DIAPH3 are not provided in the available literature.

## Function
DIAPH3, a member of the diaphanous-related formin subfamily, plays a crucial role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for maintaining cell shape, division, and motility. It is involved in actin nucleation and polymerization, processes that are vital for the formation of linear actin filaments. These filaments are critical for various cellular functions, including the assembly and constriction of the contractile ring during cytokinesis, a process necessary for cell division (Kazama2020Loss; LabatdeHoz2021Formins).

DIAPH3 is also implicated in maintaining microtubule stability, which is important for the proper functioning of the mitotic spindle during cell division. This stability is achieved through interactions with microtubules via the FH2 domain, which may regulate microtubule dynamics during cytokinesis (Kazama2020Loss; Zhang2022Diaphanousrelated).

In healthy human cells, DIAPH3 is active in the cytoplasm and cell membrane, influencing processes such as cell migration and intracellular transport. Its role in actin and microtubule regulation underscores its importance in cellular architecture and movement, contributing to the structural integrity and dynamics of the cytoskeleton (Chen2023Comprehensive).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the DIAPH3 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. DIAPH3 has been linked to auditory neuropathy, autosomal dominant, 1 (AUNA1), a form of progressive human deafness characterized by abnormal or absent auditory brainstem responses while preserving cochlear outer hair cell function. This condition is often caused by a regulatory mutation in the 5' untranslated region of DIAPH3, leading to overexpression of DIAPH3 mRNA and protein, suggesting a gain-of-function effect (Chiereghin2022Role; robusto2014inherited; LabatdeHoz2021Formins).

DIAPH3 is also implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Variants in DIAPH3 have been identified in individuals with autism, and cases have been reported where DIAPH3 mutations co-occur with mutations in other autism-related genes, suggesting a complex genetic interplay in the manifestation of ASD (LabatdeHoz2021Formins).

In cancer, DIAPH3 is highly expressed in several types, including pancreatic adenocarcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and may contribute to tumorigenesis by affecting cell migration and invasion (Zhang2022Diaphanousrelated). In colorectal carcinoma, DIAPH3 overexpression is linked to enhanced cancer cell motility and metastasis (Foda2018Role).

## Interactions
DIAPH3, a member of the formin family, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in actin and microtubule dynamics. It interacts with the Dia-interacting protein (DIP), also known as WISH and NCKIPSD, which binds to the FH1 and FH2 domains of DIAPH3. This interaction is important for the regulation of actin dynamics (Chesarone2009Unleashing). Profilin, a protein that aids in actin polymerization, also binds to the FH1 domain of DIAPH3, facilitating the recruitment of profilin-actin complexes necessary for actin assembly (Chesarone2009Unleashing).

In the context of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, DIAPH3 has been shown to interact with several proteins, including cyclin B1 (CCNB1), CCNB2, centromere protein A (CENPA), and kinesin family member 14 (KIF14). These interactions are associated with processes such as mitotic nuclear division and chromosome segregation, and they may contribute to cancer progression (Zhang2022Diaphanousrelated).

DIAPH3 also plays a role in cytokinesis by generating β-actin networks at the cytokinetic furrow, which are essential for maintaining non-muscle myosin II and RhoA at this site. RhoA, a small G-protein, regulates DIAPH3 activity by binding to it and releasing its autoinhibition, thus promoting actin polymerization (Shah2024The).
