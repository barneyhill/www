# SLC36A3

## Overview
The SLC36A3 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 36 member 3, which is part of the solute carrier (SLC) family of transporters. This family is known for its role in facilitating the transport of small molecules across cellular membranes. SLC36A3 is categorized as a transmembrane protein, indicating its integral role in the cellular membrane structure and function. The protein is involved in the transport of amino acids and other small molecules, contributing to various physiological processes. Understanding the function and regulation of SLC36A3 is crucial, as it may have implications in metabolic pathways and potential clinical significance.
