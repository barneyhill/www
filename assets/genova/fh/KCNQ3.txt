# KCNQ3

## Overview
The KCNQ3 gene encodes the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily Q member 3, a critical component of the voltage-gated potassium channels, specifically the Kv7.3 subunit. These channels are integral membrane proteins that play a pivotal role in regulating neuronal excitability by contributing to the M-type potassium current, which is essential for controlling the excitability of neurons and preventing excessive firing. The KCNQ3 protein, characterized by its six-transmembrane domain structure, can form both homomeric and heteromeric channels, with the latter often involving other KCNQ subunits such as KCNQ2. These heteromeric channels are more effective in conducting potassium ions and are crucial for maintaining normal electrical excitability in neurons. The gene's expression in key brain regions underscores its importance in maintaining neuronal stability and preventing disorders such as benign familial neonatal epilepsy. Mutations in KCNQ3 can lead to a range of neurological disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Choveau2012Pore; Miceli2020A; Rogawski2000KCNQ2KCNQ3).

## Structure
The KCNQ3 protein is a member of the voltage-gated potassium channel family, characterized by a structure typical of six-transmembrane domain K+ channel gene superfamily members. It contains a highly conserved region rich in positively charged arginine residues in the fourth transmembrane domain (S4 helix), which acts as a voltage sensor, and a pore domain (P-loop) with the consensus sequence Thr-x-x-Thr-x-Gly-Tyr-Gly (Rogawski2000KCNQ2KCNQ3). The protein is divided into three modules: the voltage-sensor domain (VSD), the pore domain (PD), and the regulatory domain (RD). The VSD includes the S2-S4 segments, the PD comprises S5-S6, and the RD is located at the carboxy terminus (Choveau2018Phosphatidylinositol).

KCNQ3 can form functional homomeric channels or heteromeric channels with other KCNQ subunits, such as KCNQ2, KCNQ4, and KCNQ5, which is crucial for its physiological function (Choveau2012Pore). The assembly of these channels involves a two-step process: dimerization followed by tetramerization, with the C-terminal region playing a crucial role in this process (GomezPosada2010A). The TCC (tetramerization coiled-coil) domains, particularly TCC1, are essential for both homomeric and heteromeric channel assembly (Schwake2006Structural). The presence of alanine at position 315 in the pore helix is specific to tetrapods and affects the channel's surface expression and trafficking (GomezPosada2010A).

## Function
The KCNQ3 gene encodes a subunit of voltage-gated potassium channels, specifically the Kv7.3 subunit, which plays a crucial role in regulating neuronal excitability. These channels are part of the M-type potassium current, which is essential for controlling the excitability of neurons by limiting repetitive spike firing in response to persistent depolarizing stimuli. The M-current is activated when a neuron is depolarized towards the spike threshold, helping to repolarize the membrane back towards the resting potential and suppressing excessive firing, a mechanism known as 'spike-frequency adaptation' (Rogawski2000KCNQ2KCNQ3).

KCNQ3, along with KCNQ2, forms heteromeric channels that are more effective in conducting potassium ions than homomeric channels formed by either subunit alone. These channels are modulated by cyclic AMP (cAMP), which enhances their activity through phosphorylation, contributing to the maintenance of normal electrical excitability in neurons (Schroeder1998Moderate). The KCNQ3 protein is expressed in critical brain areas such as the hippocampus, neocortex, and thalamus, where it contributes to the proper functioning of potassium channels, maintaining the electrical stability of neurons and preventing excessive neuronal firing that can lead to seizures (Rogawski2000KCNQ2KCNQ3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KCNQ3 gene are associated with several neurological disorders, primarily benign familial neonatal epilepsy (BFNE) and benign familial neonatal convulsions (BFNC). These conditions are characterized by seizures occurring in the neonatal period. KCNQ3 mutations can lead to a spectrum of early-onset developmental and epileptic disorders due to their impact on the Kv7.3 voltage-gated potassium channels, which are crucial for regulating neuronal excitability (Miceli2020A).

Specific mutations, such as the M240R variant, result in a loss-of-function effect by altering the voltage sensitivity of the channel, leading to non-functional homomeric channels and a depolarizing shift in activation gating in heteromeric channels (Miceli2020A). Another mutation, T313I, affects the selectivity filter region of the channel, resulting in a total loss of function in homomeric channels and a modest suppression of current in heteromeric channels (Maghera2020Familial).

The clinical outcomes of these mutations can vary, with some cases being self-limiting and pharmacoresponsive, while others may require ongoing treatment. The potential for therapeutic interventions, such as the use of β-hydroxybutyrate to reverse channel dysfunction, is being explored (Miceli2020A).

## Interactions
KCNQ3, a subunit of potassium channels, primarily interacts with KCNQ2 to form functional heteromeric channels. These channels are efficiently trafficked to the plasma membrane, particularly to the axonal initial segment and nodes of Ranvier, which are crucial for neuronal excitability (GomezPosada2010A). KCNQ3 homomeric channels, however, are inefficiently trafficked and often retained in the endoplasmic reticulum unless a specific mutation, A315T, is present. This mutation allows KCNQ3 to be trafficked to the plasma membrane independently of KCNQ2 (GomezPosada2010A).

KCNQ3 also interacts with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), a phospholipid that regulates its activity. Several positively charged residues in KCNQ3, such as R190, R242, R243, H257, R364, and H367, are critical for PIP2 interactions. These interactions are essential for the channel's function and regulation, as they influence the channel's gating and stability (Choveau2018Phosphatidylinositol). The interaction with PIP2 occurs at multiple cytoplasmic domains, including the S2-S3 and S4-S5 linkers, and the S6Jx domain, which are crucial for channel opening and stabilization (Choveau2018Phosphatidylinositol).
