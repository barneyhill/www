# EXOC1

## Overview
EXOC1 is a gene that encodes the protein exocyst complex component 1, which is a critical part of the exocyst complex, an octameric protein assembly involved in vesicle trafficking and exocytosis. This complex plays a pivotal role in the tethering of secretory vesicles to specific sites on the plasma membrane, facilitating the transport of proteins and lipids to the cell surface, which is essential for various cellular processes such as secretion, cell migration, and growth (Feng2022Single; Mizuno2015Peri-implantation). The protein encoded by EXOC1 is active in the cytoplasm and at the cell membrane, where it contributes to the dynamic remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and the assembly of desmosomes, structures crucial for cell-cell adhesion (Mizuno2015Peri-implantation). Additionally, EXOC1 is involved in immune responses, particularly in the regulation of T cell signaling pathways, and has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease pathogenesis (Feng2022Single; Halim2023The).

## Structure


## Function
The EXOC1 gene encodes a protein that is a component of the exocyst complex, which is crucial for various cellular processes, including the regulation of cellular membrane exocytosis, secretion, and vesicle transport. This complex is involved in the tethering of vesicles to specific sites on the plasma membrane, facilitating exocytosis, which is essential for the transport of proteins and lipids to the cell surface (Feng2022Single; Mizuno2015Peri-implantation). 

In the context of immune responses, the exocyst complex, including EXOC1, plays a role in the regulation of T cell signaling pathways and may be involved in the downregulation of MHC-I coding genes. This interaction is significant for CD8+ T cell-mediated immune responses, which are crucial for combating infections and related neoplasia (Feng2022Single). 

EXOC1 is active in the cytoplasm and at the cell membrane, where it contributes to cellular processes such as cell migration, growth, and secretion. It is also involved in the dynamic remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, which is important for cell morphology and movement (Mizuno2015Peri-implantation). The exocyst complex, including EXOC1, is essential for the assembly of desmosomes, which are key structures in cell-cell adhesion (Mizuno2015Peri-implantation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the EXOC1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of cancer, particularly cervical cancer, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the EXOC1 gene have been studied for their potential association with disease susceptibility. Although a study in the northern Chinese Han population did not find a significant association between EXOC1 SNPs and cervical cancer risk, certain SNPs, such as rs13117307, were linked to clinical characteristics of cervical cancer patients, suggesting a possible role in disease progression (Feng2022Single).

In mice, the EXOC1 gene is crucial for early embryonic development. A null mutation in EXOC1 leads to peri-implantation lethality, indicating its essential role in the growth of the inner cell mass during early stages of development (Mizuno2015Peri-implantation). This highlights the gene's importance in cellular processes beyond its involvement in the exocyst complex.

The exocyst complex, including EXOC1, is also involved in various cellular functions such as protein trafficking and cell migration. Dysregulation of EXOC1 can impact these processes, potentially contributing to diseases like cancer, where altered expression may affect cell migration and invasion (Halim2023The).

## Interactions
EXOC1, a component of the exocyst complex, participates in several protein interactions crucial for its function in vesicle trafficking and cellular processes. It interacts with other exocyst components, including EXOC2, EXOC3, EXOC4, EXOC6, and EXOC7, forming part of the octameric exocyst complex involved in tethering vesicles to the plasma membrane (Halim2023The; Mukerji2012Proteomic). EXOC1 also interacts with SNARE proteins STX2 and SNAP23, forming a complex essential for the formation of syncytia in spermatocytes, which are multinucleated cell structures (Osawa2021EXOC1; Osawa2020EXOC1).

The interaction of EXOC1 with PPIP5K1, a protein involved in cell motility, has been demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation assays. This interaction suggests a role for EXOC1 in regulating cell motility and actin cytoskeleton organization (Machkalyan2016PPIP5K1). Additionally, EXOC1 is involved in interactions with small GTPases such as Rab, RhoA, and Ral, which regulate its function in vesicle-mediated transport and cell migration (Machkalyan2016PPIP5K1).

EXOC1's interaction with the HIV-1 Nef protein has been identified, suggesting a role in enhancing intercellular nanotube formation, which is significant in the context of viral pathogenesis (Mukerji2012Proteomic).
