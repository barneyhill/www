# LIMA1

## Overview
LIMA1, or LIM domain and actin binding 1, is a gene that encodes a cytoskeletal protein involved in the regulation of actin filament dynamics. The protein, also known as EPLIN, is characterized by the presence of a LIM domain, which is a cysteine-rich double zinc finger motif crucial for protein-protein interactions. LIMA1 plays a significant role in stabilizing actin filaments, thereby influencing cell shape, adhesion, and motility. It is involved in various cellular processes, including the maintenance of cell-cell junctions and the regulation of lipid metabolism. The protein interacts with several other proteins, such as α-catenin and F-actin, to mediate the connection between the cadherin-catenin complex and the cytoskeleton, acting as a mechanosensitive regulator. LIMA1's involvement in cholesterol metabolism and its regulatory role in cancer progression highlight its clinical significance, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Liu2024LIMA1; Duethorn2022Lima1; Wang2023Characterization).

## Structure
LIMA1, also known as EPLIN, is an actin-binding cytoskeletal protein characterized by the presence of a LIM structural domain. The protein has two isoforms: LIMA1-a, consisting of 600 amino acids, and LIMA1-b, with 759 amino acids. The LIM domain is a cysteine-rich double zinc finger structural domain, centrally located in the protein, and is derived from transcription factors Lin-11, Isl-1, and Mec-3. This domain is crucial for protein-protein interactions and is involved in the cross-linking and binding of actin filaments, promoting the parallel formation of actin filament structures (Wang2023Characterization).

LIMA1 contains two actin-binding domains located in the N-terminal and C-terminal regions, which are essential for its function in stabilizing actin filaments and preventing their depolymerization. The protein also interacts with α-catenin and F-actin, mediating the contact of the cadherin-catenin complex with the cytoskeleton, acting as a mechanosensitive regulator (Duethorn2022Lima1). The protein's structure includes a highly conserved 22-amino acid motif, known as the Eplin Motif, positioned adjacent to the carboxyl-terminus of the EPLIN LIM domain (Koch2012The).

## Function
The LIMA1 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in the organization and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton. LIMA1 stabilizes actin filaments, increasing the number and size of actin stress fibers, and inhibits active Rac-induced membrane folding. It interacts with the actin-related protein complex 2/3 (Arp2/3) to mediate actin filament nucleation and F-actin depolymerization, which is crucial for maintaining cell shape, adhesion, and motility (Wang2023Characterization).

LIMA1 is involved in the structural and functional interconnection of the cell membrane with the cytoskeleton, essential for processes such as cell division, migration, and invasion. It supports the maintenance of the epithelial cytoskeleton and cell-cell junctions, regulating lipid metabolism and angiogenesis (Wang2023Characterization). In endothelial cells, LIMA1 enhances cell-cell cohesion and adhesion junctions by attaching VE-cadherin and catenin complexes to the actin cytoskeleton (Wang2023Characterization).

LIMA1 also plays a role in cholesterol metabolism by interacting with the Niemann-Pick C1 Like 1 (NPC1L1) protein, regulating cholesterol absorption through the recruitment of myosin Vb (Liu2024LIMA1). Its involvement in lipid metabolism is further highlighted by its regulation through ubiquitin-mediated proteasome degradation, with RNF40 identified as an E3 ubiquitin ligase targeting LIMA1 for degradation (Liu2024LIMA1).

## Clinical Significance
The LIMA1 gene has significant clinical implications in various cancers due to its role in tumor suppression and regulation of cellular processes. In digestive system cancers, such as esophageal and gastric cancer, LIMA1 expression is often downregulated, correlating with higher tumor grades and poorer patient survival. This suggests its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target. Overexpression of LIMA1 has been shown to reduce cancer cell aggressiveness, indicating a protective role against tumor progression (Wang2023Characterization).

In MALT lymphoma, LIMA1 is converted from a tumor suppressor into an oncogenic protein by the API2-MALT1 fusion, highlighting a mechanism by which LIMA1 deregulation contributes to lymphomagenesis (Nie2015Conversion). In prostate cancer, LIMA1 acts as a negative regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), with its depletion enhancing cancer cell invasion and metastasis (Wang2023Characterization).

LIMA1 is also involved in cholesterol metabolism, where mutations can lead to altered cholesterol absorption. For instance, a frameshift variant in LIMA1 has been associated with low cholesterol levels in certain populations, indicating its role in lipid metabolism disorders (Liu2024LIMA1). These findings underscore the diverse roles of LIMA1 in disease pathogenesis and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
LIMA1, also known as LIM domain and actin binding 1, participates in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. It binds to actin filaments, stabilizing the actin network and influencing cell motility and adhesion (Wang2023Characterization). LIMA1 interacts with α-catenin, facilitating the connection of the cadherin-catenin complex with F-actin, which is essential for maintaining cell-cell junctions (Wang2023Characterization). It also associates with E-cadherin and vinculin, contributing to the stability of the zonula adherens (Wang2023Characterization).

LIMA1 is involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism through its interaction with the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF40, which promotes its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Liu2024LIMA1). This interaction is mediated by the N-terminal region of LIMA1, specifically the 1-166 amino acid fragment, which is crucial for binding to RNF40 (Liu2024LIMA1). LIMA1 also interacts with the actin-stabilizing protein LUZP1, regulating actin and actin-related protein levels, which affects cell migration and ciliogenesis (Wang2023Characterization).

In the context of cancer, LIMA1 interacts with the API2-MALT1 fusion protein, a mechanism implicated in lymphomagenesis (Nie2015Conversion). This interaction is specific to the API2 moiety of API2-MALT1 and involves the C terminus of LIMA1, which contains two AKAS motifs critical for binding (Nie2015Conversion).
