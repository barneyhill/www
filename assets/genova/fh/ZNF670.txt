# ZNF670

## Overview
ZNF670 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 670, a member of the KRAB zinc-finger protein (KZFP) family, which is the largest family of transcription factors in mammals. The protein is characterized by a KRAB domain and a C-terminal C2H2 zinc finger array, which are essential for its DNA-binding capabilities. ZNF670 is notably expressed during early embryonic development and the initial stages of embryonic stem cell differentiation, suggesting its involvement in regulating gene expression during these critical periods. The gene's expression is part of the EM7 module, linked to cell cycle regulation, indicating a potential role in balancing cell proliferation and differentiation (Shen2021Conserved).

## Function
ZNF670 is a member of the KRAB zinc-finger protein (KZFP) family, which is the largest family of transcription factors in mammals. These proteins are characterized by a KRAB domain and a C-terminal C2H2 zinc finger array, which confer DNA-binding potential. ZNF670, like other young-zinc-finger-containing KZFPs, is highly expressed during early embryonic development and early stages of embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation. This expression pattern suggests that ZNF670 may play a significant role in regulating gene expression during these critical developmental phases (Shen2021Conserved).

The expression of ZNF670 is part of the EM7 module, which is associated with enriched biological processes such as cell cycle regulation. This indicates that ZNF670 may be involved in maintaining the balance between cell proliferation and differentiation during early development (Shen2021Conserved). Although specific molecular functions of ZNF670 in healthy human cells are not detailed, its high expression during early development stages implies a role in transcriptional regulation, potentially impacting cell differentiation and development (Shen2021Conserved).
