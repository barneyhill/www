# RAF1

## Overview
RAF1 is a gene that encodes the Raf-1 proto-oncogene, a serine/threonine kinase, which is a critical component of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. This pathway is essential for regulating various cellular processes, including cell division, differentiation, and survival. The Raf-1 protein, also known as Raf-1 kinase, is activated through interactions with RAS proteins, leading to a cascade of phosphorylation events that transmit signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus. As a kinase, Raf-1 plays a pivotal role in modulating cellular responses to external stimuli and is involved in processes such as cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. Mutations in the RAF1 gene are implicated in several disorders, including Noonan syndrome and various cancers, underscoring its significance in both normal cellular function and disease pathogenesis (Lim2023Prevalence; Denayer2008Clinical).

## Structure
RAF1, also known as Raf-1, is a serine/threonine kinase involved in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. The protein is composed of several key domains, including the Ras-binding domain (RBD) and the cysteine-rich domain (CRD), which are crucial for its interaction with Ras proteins and subsequent activation of the MAPK pathway (Tran2020KRAS; Cookis2021Crystal). The CRD is involved in stabilizing both the autoinhibited and active states of RAF1, interacting with the membrane, Ras, 14-3-3 proteins, and the kinase domain (Tran2020KRAS).

The secondary structure of the RAF1 CRD includes five beta-strands and a region with helical character, forming two beta-sheets with a Zn2+ binding site (Mott1996The). The CRD's structure is flexible, allowing it to interact with various ligands and participate in allosteric communication within the Ras-Raf complex (Mott1996The; Cookis2021Crystal).

RAF1 undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which regulate its activity. These modifications are essential for its function in signal transduction (Tran2020KRAS). The protein can exist in different isoforms due to splice variants, which may have distinct functional roles (Tran2020KRAS).

## Function
RAF1, also known as Raf-1, is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a pivotal role in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, which is essential for regulating cell division, differentiation, and survival. In healthy human cells, RAF1 is activated by binding to RAS proteins, which facilitates its recruitment to the plasma membrane. This activation triggers a phosphorylation cascade involving MEK1/2 and ERK1/2, ultimately transmitting signals from the cell surface to the nucleus (Leicht2007Raf; Wellbrock2004The).

RAF1 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. It interacts with mitochondrial components to modulate the phosphorylation state of the pro-apoptotic protein BAD, thereby preventing apoptosis, a mechanism that is independent of the MEK and ERK pathways (McCubrey2007Roles). RAF1 also plays a role in arterial morphogenesis and arterial-venous patterning through its regulation of the ERK signaling pathway, which is crucial for vascular development (Deng2013Endothelial).

The activity of RAF1 is tightly regulated by phosphorylation at specific sites, such as Ser259, which recruits 14-3-3 proteins to inactivate RAF1. Dephosphorylation of these sites releases 14-3-3, leading to RAF1 activation (Deng2013Endothelial). RAF1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and at the cell membrane, where it integrates signals from growth factors and other extracellular cues to modulate cellular responses (Leicht2007Raf).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RAF1 gene are associated with several disorders, most notably Noonan syndrome (NS) and LEOPARD syndrome. These conditions are part of a group known as neuro-cardiofacial-cutaneous (NCFC) syndromes, characterized by features such as cardiac defects, facial dysmorphism, short stature, and skin abnormalities (Denayer2008Clinical). RAF1 mutations are found in 3-17% of NS cases and are strongly correlated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, with a prevalence of up to 95% in affected individuals (El2016Noonan; Kobayashi2010Molecular). The most common mutation, p.S257L, is linked to progressive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and pulmonary hypertension (Mussa2021MEK).

The molecular mechanism underlying these conditions involves the dephosphorylation of serine 259, which leads to impaired binding of RAF1 to 14-3-3 proteins and partial activation of downstream ERK signaling (Kobayashi2010Molecular). This dysregulation contributes to the pathogenesis of NS and related disorders (Kobayashi2010Molecular). RAF1 mutations also result in clinical manifestations such as arrhythmias, mental retardation, and growth issues, distinguishing them from other genetic mutations associated with NS (Kobayashi2010Molecular). Additionally, RAF1 aberrations have been observed in various cancers, including bladder, gastric, and colorectal cancers, highlighting its role in tumorigenesis (Lim2023Prevalence).

## Interactions
RAF1, also known as Raf-1, is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. It interacts with a variety of proteins, forming both stable and transient complexes that regulate its activity and function. RAF1 dimerizes with BRAF, a process essential for MEK phosphorylation and subsequent cell proliferation. This interaction is regulated by phosphorylation events, particularly at Ser 621, which stabilizes the RAF1/BRAF heterodimer (Varga2017RAF1BRAF).

RAF1 also interacts with Pak1, a member of the p21-activated kinases family. Pak1 phosphorylates RAF1 at Ser 338, a critical step for RAF1 activation. This interaction is dependent on the active conformation of Pak1 and occurs at the carboxyl terminus of the Pak kinase domain (Zang2002Interaction).

RAF1's interaction with 14-3-3 proteins is crucial for its regulation. These phosphoserine-specific adapter proteins bind to phosphorylated serine residues on RAF1, enhancing its signaling capabilities. The interaction with 14-3-3 proteins is necessary for RAF1's association with other proteins, such as Bcr, although this does not directly affect RAF1 activation (KOLCH2000Meaningful).

RAF1 also forms complexes with ROKa, a cytoskeleton-regulating kinase. This interaction is modulated by the phosphorylation status of RAF1, particularly at Ser 621, which influences whether RAF1 binds to BRAF or ROKa (Varga2017RAF1BRAF).
