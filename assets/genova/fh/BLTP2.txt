# BLTP2

## Overview
BLTP2, or bridge-like lipid transfer protein family member 2, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the bridge-like lipid transfer protein (BLTP) superfamily. This protein is characterized by its long rodlike structure with an internal hydrophobic groove, which facilitates the non-vesicular transfer of lipids between organelle membranes. BLTP2 is primarily involved in the transport of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the plasma membrane (PM), playing a critical role in maintaining membrane fluidity and function. The protein's activity is particularly important under conditions where PE synthesis is compromised, ensuring lipid homeostasis and proper cellular function. BLTP2 has been implicated in various clinical contexts, including cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders, although its precise role in human diseases is still under investigation (Ng2024ProteomeWide; Banerjee2024The; Braschi2022The).

## Structure
The human gene BLTP2 encodes a protein that is part of the bridge-like lipid transfer protein (BLTP) superfamily, characterized by a long rodlike structure with an internal hydrophobic groove suitable for lipid transport. The structure of BLTP2 includes repeating β-groove (RBG) domains, each consisting of five antiparallel β-strands forming a 'U-shape' followed by an unstructured loop. These RBG domains multimerize head-to-tail, creating a continuous hydrophobic groove ideal for lipid binding and transfer. The inner surface of the RBG domain is lined with hydrophobic residues, while the outer surface is hydrophilic, facilitating its function in lipid transport (Braschi2022The).

The predicted structure of BLTP2 was obtained from the AlphaFold database, featuring a cross-section model with carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur atoms. This structural prediction aligns with its localization to endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane (ER-PM) contact sites, supporting its role in lipid transfer (Braschi2022The). While the protein's structure and function are inferred from its orthologs in yeast and flies, detailed information on its primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, specific domains, prominent folds, post-translational modifications, or splice variant isoforms in vertebrates is not extensively documented (Braschi2022The).

## Function
BLTP2, or bridge-like lipid transfer protein family member 2, plays a crucial role in maintaining phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) levels in the plasma membrane (PM) of human cells, which is essential for regulating membrane fluidity and function (Banerjee2024The). The protein is involved in transporting PE from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the PM, particularly at ER-PM contact sites, ensuring proper membrane dynamics and cellular function (Banerjee2024The; Braschi2022The). This transport is vital when PE synthesis via the Kennedy pathway is compromised, highlighting BLTP2's role in lipid homeostasis (Banerjee2024The).

BLTP2 is part of a superfamily of proteins characterized by a long rodlike structure with an internal hydrophobic groove, facilitating non-vesicular lipid transfer between organelle membranes (Braschi2022The). In healthy human cells, BLTP2's activity is crucial for maintaining the PE:PC ratio in the PM, which is important for cell growth and development, especially under conditions where PE production is limited (Banerjee2024The). The protein's function is consistent with its role in lipid transport, similar to other members of the BLTP family (Braschi2022The).

## Clinical Significance
BLTP2 has been implicated in several clinical contexts, although its precise role in human diseases is still being elucidated. In cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), BLTP2 is identified as a pro-survival factor. Its expression is significantly higher in TNBC cells compared to non-cancerous cells, and its depletion leads to reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis, suggesting a role in cancer cell survival and aggressiveness (Banerjee2024The). Overexpression of BLTP2 has been associated with poor cancer prognosis, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Parolek2023Bridgelike).

In neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), significant clustering of missense variants in the BLTP2 gene has been identified, suggesting its involvement in these conditions. Variants at specific positions, such as 1487, are enriched in NDD cohorts, indicating potential clinical significance (Ng2024ProteomeWide). These findings suggest that BLTP2 may play a role in the genetic basis of NDDs, although further research is needed to fully understand its impact.

Despite these associations, there is no established disease directly linked to mutations or absence of BLTP2 in humans, highlighting the need for further investigation into its clinical significance (Parolek2023Bridgelike).
