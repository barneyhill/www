# PASD1

## Overview
PASD1, or Per-Arnt-Sim Domain Containing 1, is a gene located on the X chromosome (Xq28) that encodes a nuclear protein known as PAS domain containing repressor 1. This protein is characterized by the presence of a PAS domain and a leucine zipper motif, which are indicative of its role in transcriptional regulation. PASD1 is classified as a cancer/testis antigen due to its restricted expression in normal testicular tissue and aberrant expression in various cancers, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer. The protein functions as a repressor of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complex, a key component of the circadian rhythm regulation, by inhibiting its transcriptional activity through molecular mimicry. This interaction suggests a potential role in tumorigenesis by disrupting circadian rhythms. PASD1's expression in cancerous tissues and its immunogenic properties make it a promising target for cancer immunotherapy (Michael2015CancerTestis; Liggins2004A; SUKOR2022Cancer).

## Structure
The PASD1 protein is encoded by the PASD1 gene and is associated with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). It is identified as a cancer/testis antigen and is located on the X chromosome (Xq28) (Liggins2004A). PASD1 has two splice isoforms, PASD1_v1 and PASD1_v2, which differ in their C-terminal regions. PASD1_v1 encodes a 639 amino acid protein, while PASD1_v2 encodes a 773 amino acid protein, with both sharing the first 638 amino acids (Michael2015CancerTestis; Liggins2004A).

The protein contains a PAS domain, which is involved in signal transduction, and a leucine zipper motif, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation (Liggins2004A). The PASD1 protein also includes a nuclear localization signal and a predicted mitochondrial presequence cleavage site (Liggins2004A). The C terminus of PASD1, particularly in the PASD1_v2 variant, includes coiled-coil domains (CC1 and CC2), which are crucial for its function as a repressor of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complex, a key component of the circadian rhythm regulation (Michael2015CancerTestis).

PASD1 acts as a nuclear repressor, inhibiting the transcriptional activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complex, and is expressed in normal testis and various cancer tissues (Michael2015CancerTestis; Liggins2004A).

## Function
The PASD1 gene encodes a nuclear protein that plays a significant role in regulating the circadian clock in mammals. It functions as a repressor of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complex, a central component of the molecular circadian clock, by inhibiting its transcriptional activity. This repression is achieved through molecular mimicry, where PASD1 interacts with the CLOCK:BMAL1 complex, particularly targeting a region conserved with CLOCK exon 19, to suppress transcriptional activation and circadian timekeeping (Michael2015CancerTestis).

In healthy human cells, PASD1 expression is typically restricted to gametogenic tissues, such as the testis, where it is classified as a cancer/testis antigen. Its expression in these tissues suggests a role in the early stages of spermatogenesis, particularly in spermatogonia, which are involved in the initial phase of sperm development (Djureinovic2014The). The protein is localized in the nucleus, especially at the periphery where heterochromatin is compartmentalized, indicating its involvement in nuclear processes related to transcriptional regulation (Michael2015CancerTestis). The precise function of PASD1 in normal testicular function or other physiological processes remains to be fully elucidated (Djureinovic2014The).

## Clinical Significance
PASD1 is clinically significant due to its role as a cancer/testis antigen, with aberrant expression linked to various cancers, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and colorectal cancer (CRC) (Cooper2006PASD1; Liggins2004A; SUKOR2022Cancer). In DLBCL, PASD1 expression is associated with poor prognosis, particularly in non-germinal center subtypes, and is considered a potential marker for high-risk patients (Liggins2004A). The gene's expression in CRC is higher in advanced stages, suggesting a role in carcinogenesis and as a marker for high-risk cancer (SUKOR2022Cancer).

PASD1's interaction with the circadian rhythm regulatory complex CLOCK:BMAL1 suggests it may contribute to cancer progression by suppressing circadian clock function, potentially promoting a return to a germ-like state in tumors (Michael2015CancerTestis). This suppression of circadian rhythms is linked to various diseases, including cancer, highlighting PASD1's potential impact on tumorigenesis (Michael2015CancerTestis).

PASD1 is also being explored as a target for immunotherapy due to its restricted expression in normal tissues and its immunogenicity, with cytotoxic T lymphocytes recognizing PASD1 peptides in DLBCL patients (Ait‐Tahar2009Cytolytic).

## Interactions
PASD1 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation and tumorigenesis. It is a positive regulator of STAT3 activity, a critical transcription factor involved in various cellular processes. PASD1 specifically interacts with STAT3, enhancing its activation and phosphorylation, particularly in the presence of IL-6. This interaction is facilitated by the N-terminal part of PASD1, including the PAS domain, which is crucial for binding with STAT3. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have demonstrated that PASD1 competes with TC45, a protein tyrosine phosphatase, for binding to STAT3, thereby inhibiting TC45-mediated dephosphorylation of STAT3 and promoting the transcription of STAT3 target genes involved in tumorigenesis (Xu2016PASD1).

PASD1 also interacts with the circadian transcription factor complex CLOCK:BMAL1, acting as a repressor. It interacts with BMAL1 but not directly with CLOCK, suggesting that PASD1 targets the CLOCK:BMAL1 complex through BMAL1. The coiled-coil domain 1 (CC1) of PASD1, homologous to exon 19 of CLOCK, is essential for this interaction. This mimicry interferes with the transcriptional activation by CLOCK:BMAL1, thereby silencing the circadian clock (Michael2015CancerTestis).
