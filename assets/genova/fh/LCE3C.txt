# LCE3C

## Overview
LCE3C is a gene that encodes the late cornified envelope 3C protein, which is part of the late cornified envelope (LCE) family. This protein plays a significant role in the formation and repair of the skin barrier, particularly within the epidermis. The LCE3C gene is located within the epidermal differentiation complex on chromosome 1q21, a genomic region rich in genes involved in skin differentiation and barrier function. The protein encoded by LCE3C is categorized as a barrier repair protein, becoming particularly active in response to skin injury or inflammation. Its expression is typically low in healthy skin but is upregulated following barrier disruption, mediated by proinflammatory cytokines. The deletion of LCE3C, often in conjunction with LCE3B, has been linked to an increased risk of psoriasis and other autoimmune disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining skin integrity and immune response regulation (Bassaganyas2013Worldwide; Bergboer2011Psoriasis).

## Function
LCE3C, a member of the late cornified envelope (LCE) gene family, plays a crucial role in skin barrier function and repair. In healthy human cells, LCE3C is primarily expressed in the epidermis, where it contributes to the formation of the cornified envelope, a protective barrier essential for maintaining skin integrity. This gene is part of the epidermal differentiation complex located on chromosome 1q21, a region enriched with genes involved in epidermal differentiation (Bergboer2011Psoriasis).

Under normal conditions, LCE3C expression is low or absent in healthy skin but is significantly induced following skin barrier disruption or injury. This induction is driven by proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1α, and IL-6, suggesting that LCE3C functions as a barrier repair protein (Bergboer2011Psoriasis). The protein encoded by LCE3C is thought to be involved in the repair mechanisms of the skin, becoming particularly important in response to injury or inflammation (Bergboer2011Psoriasis).

The deletion of LCE3C, along with LCE3B, is associated with an increased risk of psoriasis, indicating that these genes are vital for a complete barrier repair response. Their absence may lead to increased skin permeability and potentially trigger immune responses (Bergboer2011Psoriasis).

## Clinical Significance
The LCE3C gene is clinically significant due to its association with psoriasis and other autoimmune disorders. A common genetic variant involving the deletion of the LCE3C and LCE3B genes, known as the LCE3C_LCE3B deletion, is prevalent in individuals with psoriasis. This deletion is found in 65-75% of psoriasis patients and is thought to impair the healing of psoriatic lesions by affecting skin repair processes (Bassaganyas2013Worldwide; Karrys2018Bioactive). The deletion is also linked to other autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, particularly in European and Asian populations (Bassaganyas2013Worldwide).

The LCE3C_LCE3B deletion may contribute to abnormal skin differentiation and hyperproliferation, characteristic of psoriasis, by disrupting the normal function of the LCE3C gene in epidermal activation during inflammation (Bassaganyas2013Worldwide). Despite its association with autoimmune diseases, the deletion alone is insufficient to cause these conditions without other susceptibility factors (Bassaganyas2013Worldwide). The deletion's prevalence in non-Sub-Saharan African populations suggests it may have been subject to natural selection, potentially providing historical advantages against certain pathogens (Bassaganyas2013Worldwide).

## Interactions
The LCE3C gene, part of the late cornified envelope (LCE) family, is involved in skin barrier formation and repair. Despite its role in these processes, direct physical interactions between LCE3C and other proteins have not been conclusively demonstrated. Studies have explored potential interactions between LCE proteins and corneodesmosin (CDSN) in the context of psoriasis, but no direct interactions were found through co-expression experiments and GST pull-down assays (Bergboer2014Analysis).

The LCE3C gene is part of a cluster that includes LCE3B, and their deletion has been associated with an increased risk of psoriasis. This deletion is thought to affect skin barrier repair, potentially leading to increased exposure to environmental antigens and a heightened immune response (Pajic2016The). The deletion may also influence the expression of other LCE3 proteins, such as LCE3A, which could act as a compensatory mechanism (Chandra2016Increased).

While specific protein-protein interactions involving LCE3C have not been detailed, the gene's involvement in skin barrier function and its genetic interactions with other psoriasis-associated alleles, such as HLA-Cw6, suggest a complex role in skin health and disease (Chandra2016Increased).
