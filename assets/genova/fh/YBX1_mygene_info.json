The encoded protein functions as both a DNA and RNA binding protein and has been implicated in numerous cellular processes including regulation of transcription and translation, pre-mRNA splicing, DNA reparation and mRNA packaging. This protein is also a component of messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes and may have a role in microRNA processing. This protein can be secreted through non-classical pathways and functions as an extracellular mitogen. Aberrant expression of the gene is associated with cancer proliferation in numerous tissues. This gene may be a prognostic marker for poor outcome and drug resistance in certain cancers. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Pseudogenes of this gene are found on multiple chromosomes.
