# AIG1

## Overview
The AIG1 gene encodes the protein androgen induced 1, which is an atypical integral membrane hydrolase involved in lipid metabolism, specifically the hydrolysis of fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFAs) (Parsons2016AIG1). This protein plays a significant role in regulating FAHFA levels, which are associated with insulin sensitivity and metabolic processes, thereby implicating AIG1 in potential therapeutic strategies for metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes (Parsons2016AIG1). AIG1 is also involved in various cellular pathways through its interactions with other proteins, such as RCHY1 and TMBIM6, influencing processes like p53-mediated pathways and endoplasmic reticulum calcium content (Nickel2016Androgeninducible). Additionally, AIG1 has clinical significance in cancer, where its expression levels and interactions can affect tumor progression and patient prognosis (Nickel2016Androgeninducible).

## Function
The AIG1 gene encodes a protein that functions as a principal hydrolase for fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFAs) in human cells. This protein is involved in the hydrolysis of FAHFAs, a class of bioactive lipids associated with insulin sensitivity and metabolic processes (Parsons2016AIG1). AIG1 is characterized as an atypical integral membrane hydrolase, utilizing conserved threonine and histidine residues for its enzymatic activity (Parsons2016AIG1). The protein is highly expressed in certain human cell lines, such as the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP, and is active in the cytoplasm (Parsons2016AIG1).

In healthy human cells, AIG1 plays a crucial role in regulating FAHFA levels, contributing to lipid metabolism and potentially influencing insulin sensitivity (Parsons2016AIG1). The activity of AIG1 is essential for the inactivation of these lipids, as demonstrated by significant reductions in FAHFA hydrolysis when AIG1 expression is knocked down (Parsons2016AIG1). This regulation of FAHFA metabolism suggests that AIG1 may be a target for therapeutic interventions in metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes (Parsons2016AIG1).

## Clinical Significance
The androgen-induced gene 1 (AIG1) has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to its role in cellular processes and interactions. In hepatocellular carcinoma, reduced expression of AIG1 mRNA is associated with shorter survival times, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Nickel2016Androgeninducible). AIG1's interaction with the RCHY1 E3 ligase affects p53 reporter gene activity and activates the NFAT signaling pathway, which is involved in cell proliferation and survival, indicating its role in cancer progression (Nickel2016Androgeninducible).

AIG1 has also been identified as a fusion partner in certain cancers, such as salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma and Sezary Syndrome, highlighting its involvement in oncogenic processes (Nickel2016Androgeninducible). Overexpression of AIG1 increases endoplasmic reticulum calcium content and susceptibility to oxidative stress, which may contribute to its role in cancer and other diseases related to cellular stress responses (Nickel2016Androgeninducible).

In Entamoeba histolytica, AIG1 family proteins, including EHI_176590, are linked to virulence and stress response, with differential expression observed in virulent versus non-virulent strains. This suggests that alterations in AIG1 expression may influence pathogenicity and adaptation to host environments (NakadaTsukui2018AIG1).

## Interactions
AIG1 (androgen induced 1) is known to interact with several proteins, influencing various cellular pathways. AIG1 interacts with the Ring Finger And CHY Zinc Finger Domain Containing 1 (RCHY1, also known as Pirh2) E3 ligase. This interaction was identified through yeast two-hybrid screening and confirmed at the molecular level. AIG1 expression reduces p53 reporter gene activity, suggesting a role in modulating RCHY1 activity and potentially influencing p53-mediated pathways (Parsons2016AIG1; Nickel2016Androgeninducible).

AIG1 is also identified as a potential interactor of Transmembrane Bax inhibitor motif containing 6 (TMBIM6), also known as Bax inhibitor-1, through a split-ubiquitin screening technique. This interaction suggests a role in controlling endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium content and influencing cell death susceptibility against oxidative stress (Nickel2016Androgeninducible).

In addition to these interactions, AIG1 is involved in FAHFA metabolism as a principal FAHFA hydrolase in human cells. It interacts with small molecule inhibitors, such as the β-lactone KC01 and the N-hydroxyhydantoin carbamate JJH260, which inhibit its activity (Parsons2016AIG1). These interactions highlight AIG1's involvement in cellular stress responses and lipid metabolism.
