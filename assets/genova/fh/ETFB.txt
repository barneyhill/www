# ETFB

## Overview
The ETFB gene encodes the electron transfer flavoprotein subunit beta, a critical component of the mitochondrial electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) complex. This protein is integral to mitochondrial energy metabolism, functioning as a part of a heterodimeric enzyme that facilitates electron transfer from various dehydrogenases to the electron transport chain. The ETF complex, comprising both alpha and beta subunits, plays a pivotal role in the oxidation of fatty acids and amino acids, thereby contributing to ATP production. The ETFB protein is characterized by its interaction with cofactors such as flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and adenosine monophosphate (AMP), and it is subject to post-translational modifications that influence its stability and function. Mutations in the ETFB gene are linked to metabolic disorders such as glutaric aciduria type II and have been implicated in anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity, underscoring its clinical significance in energy metabolism and disease (RuizPinto2017Exome; Zhang2020Hepatic; Henriques2021Electron).

## Structure
The ETFB gene encodes the beta subunit of the electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF), which is a heterodimeric enzyme involved in mitochondrial energy metabolism. The primary structure of the ETFB protein consists of 255 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 27,877 Da (FINOCCHIARO1993cDNA). The secondary structure includes specific domains, with domain III being mostly composed of the ETF-β subunit, which interacts with the AMP cofactor (Henriques2021Electron). 

The tertiary structure of ETFB involves the folding of these domains to facilitate interactions with cofactors and partner proteins. The quaternary structure of ETF involves the formation of a heterodimer with the alpha subunit, containing one flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and one adenosine monophosphate (AMP) per dimer (Henriques2021Electron). 

The ETFB subunit plays a crucial role in the interaction with dehydrogenases, such as the ETF:MCAD complex, where a recognition loop in the β-subunit facilitates electron transfer (Henriques2021Electron). Post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms have been identified, including a splice variant of the ETFA gene, which may affect the mitochondrial leader peptide (Olsen2003Clear).

## Function
The ETFB gene encodes the beta subunit of the electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF), a crucial component in mitochondrial energy metabolism. ETF is a dimeric enzyme located in the mitochondrial matrix, composed of ETF-α and ETF-β subunits. It functions as a hub for electron transfer, receiving electrons from at least 14 different flavoenzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation and amino acid degradation. These electrons are then relayed to the respiratory chain, contributing to ATP production (Henriques2021Electron).

ETFB plays a critical role in maintaining efficient electron flow and energy production in healthy human cells. The ETF complex, including ETFB, facilitates the transfer of electrons from acyl-CoA dehydrogenases to the electron transport chain, which is essential for energy production, particularly in tissues with high energy demands like muscle and liver (Henriques2021Electron).

Neddylation, a post-translational modification, stabilizes ETFB by preventing its ubiquitination and degradation, thus maintaining its function in fatty acid β-oxidation. This process is crucial for preventing metabolic disorders such as glutaric acidemia type II (GA-II) and ensuring proper metabolic function in the liver (Zhang2020Hepatic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ETFB gene are associated with glutaric aciduria type II (GAII), a rare metabolic disorder characterized by hypoketotic hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and fatty infiltration of organs such as the liver, heart, and kidneys. GAII results from defects in the electron transport flavoprotein (ETF), which includes the ETFA and ETFB subunits. A specific mutation, c.143_145delAGG (p.Glu48del), in the ETFB gene has been linked to a severe neonatal-onset form of GAII, presenting with symptoms like cardiomegaly, metabolic acidosis, hypoglycemia, and hypotonia. This mutation leads to a rapid development of cardiomegaly due to a shift in myocardial energy metabolism from lactate and glucose to fatty acids (Sudo2015A).

The ETFB gene is also implicated in anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity (AIC), a condition that can cause progressive and irreversible cardiac damage. A missense variant, rs79338777 (p.Pro52Leu; c.155C>T), in the ETFB gene has been identified as a significant risk factor for chronic AIC in cancer patients treated with anthracyclines. This variant is associated with an increased risk of severe cardiac failure or a significant decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (RuizPinto2017Exome).

## Interactions
ETFB (electron transfer flavoprotein subunit beta) is involved in several protein-protein interactions within the mitochondrial matrix. It forms a stable complex with ETFA, the alpha subunit of the electron transfer flavoprotein, to facilitate electron transfer from various dehydrogenases to the electron transport chain. This interaction is crucial for the degradation pathways of fatty acids and amino acids (Toogood2004Extensive).

ETFB interacts directly with glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (GCDH), as demonstrated by His6-pulldown experiments, indicating a role in lysine and tryptophan degradation pathways (Schmiesing2014Interaction). The interaction between ETFB and GCDH is part of a larger network of interactions that include other mitochondrial matrix proteins, such as dihydrolipoamide S-succinyltransferase (DLST) (Schmiesing2014Interaction).

In cardiomyocyte mitochondria, ETFB has been shown to co-localize with mitochondrial connexin 43 (Cx43) and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), suggesting a potential interaction that may be involved in mitochondrial function and signaling pathways (Denuc2016New). The study of these interactions highlights the multifaceted role of ETFB in mitochondrial energy metabolism and its involvement in various metabolic pathways.
