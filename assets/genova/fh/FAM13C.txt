# FAM13C

## Overview
FAM13C is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 13, member C. This protein is primarily involved in signal transduction and cytoskeletal organization, playing a crucial role in maintaining cell shape and motility. The FAM13C protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including lipid metabolism, although the exact mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Its involvement in these pathways suggests a broader role in cellular homeostasis and response to external stimuli. Clinically, FAM13C has been associated with prognostic outcomes in certain cancers, such as uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma and prostate cancer, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for disease progression and patient survival (Chi2023FAM).

## Function
FAM13C is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several critical cellular processes, primarily within the cytoplasm. The protein plays a significant role in signal transduction and cytoskeletal organization, which are essential for maintaining cell shape and motility. These functions are crucial for the dynamic changes that cells undergo in response to external stimuli, allowing them to adapt and maintain tissue homeostasis. The involvement of FAM13C in these pathways suggests it may also have a role in lipid metabolism, although the precise mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. By influencing these cellular processes, FAM13C contributes to the regulation of cellular responses, ensuring proper function and stability within tissues.

## Clinical Significance
The FAM13C gene has been identified as having clinical significance in the context of uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC). Alterations in the expression of FAM13C are associated with the prognosis of UCEC, where low expression levels correlate with poorer disease-specific survival and progression-free intervals. This suggests that FAM13C could serve as a biomarker for predicting clinical outcomes in UCEC patients (Chi2023FAM). A prognostic risk model incorporating FAM13C, along with FAM110B and FAM72A, has been developed, demonstrating higher predictive accuracy for survival probabilities compared to conventional methods (Chi2023FAM). The model's risk score, which includes FAM13C expression levels, is a reliable predictor of patient outcomes, outperforming traditional clinicopathological features (Chi2023FAM).

In prostate cancer, FAM13C overexpression has been identified as a strong and independent prognostic factor, indicating its potential role in tumor progression (Chi2023FAM). Although the specific role of FAM13C in UCEC remains unclear, its involvement in intracellular signaling pathways relevant to cancer suggests significant implications for prognosis and treatment strategies (Chi2023FAM). Further research is needed to fully understand the functional impact of FAM13C in these diseases.
