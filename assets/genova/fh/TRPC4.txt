# TRPC4

## Overview
The TRPC4 gene encodes the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily C member 4, a protein that belongs to the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family. This protein functions as a non-selective cation channel, primarily facilitating calcium entry into cells, and is involved in various cellular processes, including calcium signaling pathways. TRPC4 is expressed in a range of tissues, such as neurons, cardiovascular cells, and immune cells, where it plays a role in regulating vascular tone, endothelial permeability, and neurotransmitter release (Freichel2014TRPC4). The protein structure of TRPC4 includes six transmembrane segments and features motifs typical of TRP channels, such as ankyrin-like repeats and a coiled-coil domain, which are crucial for its function and interactions with other proteins (Freichel2014TRPC4). TRPC4's involvement in physiological and pathological processes, including its association with neurodevelopmental disorders and cardiovascular diseases, underscores its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Minard2018Remarkable; Gupta2023Identification).

## Structure
The TRPC4 protein is a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family and functions as a non-selective cation channel. It is encoded by the TRPC4 gene, which produces two splice variants: TRPC4α and TRPC4β. TRPC4α consists of 974-981 amino acids, while TRPC4β lacks an 84 amino acid domain in the C-terminal region, affecting calmodulin binding and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor interaction (Freichel2014TRPC4).

The protein structure includes six transmembrane segments (TM1-TM6) with a pore-forming region between TM5 and TM6. It contains several conserved motifs typical of TRP channels, such as the M1-M4 motifs, with M4 containing a 'TRP box' crucial for electrostatic interactions (Freichel2014TRPC4). The TRPC4 protein also features ankyrin-like repeats, a coiled-coil domain, and multimerization domains in the N-terminus, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and oligomerization (Freichel2014TRPC4).

Post-translational modifications include phosphorylation by Src family tyrosine kinases at specific positions following epidermal growth factor receptor stimulation (Freichel2014TRPC4). The TTRL motif at the C-terminus serves as a PDZ-interacting domain, facilitating association with NHERF (Freichel2014TRPC4). The protein can form homomeric or heteromeric channels with other TRPC subunits, such as TRPC1 and TRPC5 (Duan2018Structure).

## Function
TRPC4 is a member of the transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) family of ion channels, which are integral membrane proteins involved in various cellular processes. TRPC4 channels are primarily involved in calcium signaling pathways, playing a crucial role in calcium entry into cells. They can function as store-operated channels with high calcium selectivity or as non-store-operated channels carrying sodium ions, activated by Gαq- and/or Gαi-coupled receptors (Freichel2014TRPC4). 

In healthy human cells, TRPC4 channels are implicated in regulating vascular tone, endothelial permeability, and neurotransmitter release. They are expressed in various tissues, including neurons, cardiovascular cells, and immune cells, contributing to diverse physiological functions (Freichel2014TRPC4). TRPC4 interacts with IP3 receptors, suggesting its role in calcium release from intracellular stores, and it is involved in regulating calcium entry and signaling in response to changes in cytosolic calcium levels (Freichel2014TRPC4).

TRPC4 channels also play a role in cell proliferation and store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) in various cell types, such as human corneal epithelial cells and human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (Freichel2014TRPC4). These channels are essential for myocyte enhancer factor 2 expression and myotube formation in human myoblasts, highlighting their importance in muscle cell differentiation and function (Freichel2014TRPC4).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TRPC4 gene have been implicated in several neurodevelopmental and neurological disorders. A study identified TRPC4 as a novel autism gene, with a specific splicing variant, c.379-2A > T, found in a family from Qatar. This variant was classified as pathogenic and suggests a potential role for TRPC4 in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other neurodevelopmental disorders (Gupta2023Identification). TRPC4 is also associated with epilepsy, as its expression is upregulated in cortical lesions of focal cortical dysplasia type II and tuberous sclerosis complex, conditions linked to chronic refractory epilepsy. This upregulation correlates with seizure frequency, indicating TRPC4's involvement in epileptogenesis (Wang2017Elevated).

In addition to neurological conditions, TRPC4 has been linked to cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. It plays a role in calcium cycling in cardiomyocytes and is implicated in pathological cardiac remodeling and pulmonary hypertension. TRPC4 inactivation has shown protective effects against these conditions in animal models (Minard2018Remarkable). These findings highlight the clinical significance of TRPC4 in various diseases, emphasizing the need for further research to explore its therapeutic potential.

## Interactions
TRPC4 interacts with a variety of proteins that influence its function and localization. It forms complexes with NHERF proteins, which are crucial for its stabilization and retention in the plasma membrane (Storch2016Dynamic; Freichel2014TRPC4). The interaction with NHERF is mediated through a PDZ-binding motif on TRPC4, which also allows binding with other scaffolding proteins like ZO-1 (CIOFFI2006Regulation).

TRPC4 interacts with protein 4.1, which is essential for the activation of store-operated calcium (SOC) channels. Disruption of this interaction prevents SOC channel activation, highlighting the importance of protein 4.1 in linking TRPC4 to the membrane skeleton (CIOFFI2006Regulation; Cioffi2005Activation).

TRPC4 also associates with calmodulin and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs), which regulate its activity. Calmodulin binds to TRPC4 in a calcium-dependent manner, inhibiting the channel in its resting state, while IP3Rs can displace calmodulin to activate the channel (Tang2001Identification; Vinayagam2020Structural).

In endothelial cells, TRPC4 interacts with FKBP52 and FKBP51, immunophilins that may play a role in its function (Freichel2014TRPC4). Additionally, TRPC4 forms heteromeric complexes with TRPC1 and TRPC5, contributing to its role in calcium entry (Freichel2014TRPC4).
