# ZNF90

## Overview
ZNF90 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 90, a member of the Kruppel-associated box zinc finger (KRAB-ZNF) protein family. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger motifs and a KRAB domain, which are essential for its role as a transcription factor involved in transcriptional repression and chromatin modulation (Shen2021Conserved; Perdomo-Sabogal2019Genetic). Zinc finger protein 90 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it binds to specific DNA sequences to regulate the expression of target genes, influencing various cellular processes such as metabolism, immune responses, and stem cell maintenance (Luo2023Identification). The protein's interactions with other proteins, such as KRAB-associated protein 1 (KAP1) and TRIM28, further underscore its role in transcriptional regulation and chromatin structure modulation (Chang2023AcetylationMimic; Shen2021Conserved). ZNF90 has been implicated in several clinical contexts, including vitiligo, cancer, and reproductive health, highlighting its diverse biological significance (Lian2024Singlecell; Luo2023Identification; Micci2010Array‐CGH).

## Structure
ZNF90 is a member of the KRAB zinc finger protein family, characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs and a KRAB domain. The primary structure of ZNF90 includes a series of cysteine and histidine residues that coordinate a zinc ion, forming the zinc finger motifs essential for DNA binding (Perdomo-Sabogal2019Genetic). These motifs are crucial for the protein's DNA-binding specificity and stability. The KRAB domain, located at the N-terminus, is a conserved protein motif involved in transcriptional repression through interaction with the cofactor KAP-1, which recruits histone-modifying factors (Shen2021Conserved).

The secondary structure of ZNF90 likely includes alpha-helical regions within the KRAB domain, which are typical for proteins in this family (PONCELET1998Functional). The tertiary structure involves the overall 3D folding of the protein, allowing the zinc finger motifs to interact with DNA. There is no specific information on the quaternary structure of ZNF90, suggesting it may function as a monomer.

ZNF90 may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its function and localization. The presence of nonsynonymous SNPs in ZNF90 suggests potential genetic variability that could influence its interaction with DNA and cofactors, possibly affecting local adaptation and disease susceptibility (Perdomo-Sabogal2019Genetic).

## Function
ZNF90 is a zinc finger protein that functions primarily as a transcription factor, playing a significant role in regulating gene expression. It is part of the larger family of Kruppel-associated box zinc finger (KRAB-ZNF) proteins, which are known for their involvement in transcriptional repression and chromatin modulation (Eichler1998Complex). ZNF90 is active in the nucleus, where it binds to specific DNA sequences to modulate the transcription of target genes, impacting various cellular processes such as metabolism, autophagy, apoptosis, immune responses, differentiation, and stem cell maintenance (Luo2023Identification).

The KRAB domain of ZNF90 is crucial for its function, facilitating protein-protein interactions necessary for transcriptional repression. This domain is associated with chromatin modulation, suggesting that ZNF90 may influence chromatin structure rather than gene-specific transcriptional regulation (Eichler1998Complex). In the context of immune response, ZNF90 expression is positively correlated with γδ T cells and negatively correlated with monocytes, indicating a potential role in immune system modulation (Luo2023Identification). The protein's involvement in maintaining zinc homeostasis is also suggested, which is important for reproductive health and oocyte quality (Luo2023Identification).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF90, a member of the zinc finger protein family, plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation and has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression or mutations. In the context of vitiligo, ZNF90-positive fibroblasts have been associated with skin repair and regeneration, particularly through their involvement in collagen formation and melanin biosynthesis. These fibroblasts interact with melanocytes via signaling pathways such as JAG1-NOTCH and NRP2-VEGFA/SEMA3C, which are crucial for repigmentation in vitiligo treatment (Lian2024Singlecell).

In cancer research, ZNF90 has been identified in chromosome 19 gains in ovarian carcinomas, suggesting its potential role in oncogenesis through overexpression or rearrangement. This overexpression may contribute to carcinogenesis by altering the regulation of key target genes (Micci2010Array‐CGH).

Additionally, ZNF90 has been studied in the context of recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL), where it was found to be down-regulated. This down-regulation showed a correlation with immune cell infiltration, indicating a potential impact on immune responses and reproductive health (Luo2023Identification). These findings highlight the diverse clinical significance of ZNF90 in various conditions.

## Interactions
ZNF90, a member of the zinc finger protein family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It is known to interact with the KRAB-associated protein 1 (KAP1), forming transcriptional regulating complexes. This interaction is facilitated by the structured KRAB domain of ZNF90, which is crucial for stable protein-protein interactions (Shen2021Conserved). 

ZNF90 is also part of the largest cluster of KRAB-ZNF genes located in the cytogenetic band interval 19p12, which includes approximately 40 closely related loci. These genes, including ZNF90, are potent transcriptional repressors, and their interactions are thought to be more related to chromatin modulation rather than gene-specific transcriptional regulation (Eichler1998Complex).

In the context of vitiligo treatment, ZNF90+ fibroblasts have been shown to engage in cell-cell communication with melanocytes through several signaling pathways, including JAG1-NOTCH, NRP2-VEGFA/SEMA3C, and CD44-HBEGF. These interactions suggest a role for ZNF90 in influencing melanocyte behavior and maintaining homeostasis (Lian2024Singlecell). 

ZNF90 also interacts with TRIM28, a protein involved in gene regulation. This interaction is maintained even when TRIM28 undergoes an acetylation-mimic mutation, indicating a stable association between ZNF90 and TRIM28 (Chang2023AcetylationMimic).
