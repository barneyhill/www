# SEMG2

## Overview
SEMG2 is a gene that encodes the protein semenogelin 2, which is predominantly found in human seminal plasma. This protein plays a critical role in the reproductive system by contributing to the formation of the semen coagulum, a gelatinous mass that forms immediately after ejaculation and subsequently liquefies. Semenogelin 2 is categorized as a structural protein due to its involvement in the coagulation and liquefaction processes of semen, which are essential for sperm motility and successful fertilization (JensenSeaman2003Evolution). Beyond its reproductive functions, SEMG2 has been implicated in cancer biology, where it interacts with metabolic enzymes and participates in RNA processing, suggesting a broader role in cellular metabolism and gene expression regulation (Shuvalov2020SEMG12). The gene's expression and mutations have clinical significance, particularly in cancer and male infertility, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Wu2019Association; Shuvalov2020SEMG12).

## Structure
SEMG2, or semenogelin 2, is a protein encoded by the SEMG2 gene, primarily found in human seminal plasma. The primary structure of SEMG2 consists of a precursor protein with 582 amino acids, which is processed to a secreted form of 559 amino acids. This protein has a molecular weight of 71 or 76 kDa, depending on glycosylation (Shuvalov2021Emerging). The genomic structure of SEMG2 includes three exons, with the first exon encoding a signal peptide, the second exon encoding the majority of the protein, and the third exon being untranslated (JensenSeaman2003Evolution).

In terms of secondary structure, the SEM2(49-107) peptide, a fragment of SEMG2, has been shown to form amyloid fibrils with helical segments at the C-terminal, as revealed by NMR spectroscopy (Troshkina20241H). The SEMG2 protein contains eight 60-amino acid repeats, which are similar to those in SEMG1 but with two additional repeats (JensenSeaman2003Evolution).

SEMG2 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which affects its molecular weight (Shuvalov2021Emerging). The protein may also exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context.

## Function
SEMG2 (semenogelin 2) is a gene that encodes a protein primarily found in human semen, playing a crucial role in the formation of the semen coagulum. This protein contributes to the viscous gelatinous consistency of semen by forming high molecular weight complexes responsible for its coagulation immediately after ejaculation. In humans, the semen coagulates to form a gelatinous mass, which liquefies within 20 minutes due to the action of the prostate-derived enzyme kallikrein 3, also known as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (JensenSeaman2003Evolution).

The SEMG2 protein is involved in reproductive processes, particularly in sperm motility regulation and the formation of the copulatory plug, which may inhibit sperm motility and facilitate successful fertilization. The protein may interact noncovalently or through transglutaminase activity to form complexes, suggesting its structural role in the semen coagulum (JensenSeaman2003Evolution). SEMG2 is expressed at low levels in nonreproductive tissues, indicating its primary function is related to reproduction (JensenSeaman2003Evolution). The gene's evolutionary changes, such as variations in protein length, may correlate with sperm competition levels among species, highlighting its significance in reproductive strategies (JensenSeaman2003Evolution).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SEMG2 gene have been associated with various clinical conditions, particularly in the context of cancer and male infertility. In cancer, SEMG2 is re-expressed in several malignancies, including prostate, lung, and renal cancers, where it is linked to cancer cell metabolism and progression. Overexpression of SEMG2 in cancer cells has been shown to enhance glycolysis and respiration, contributing to increased energy metabolism and potentially promoting tumor aggressiveness (Shuvalov2020SEMG12). In prostate cancer, SEMG2 expression is inversely correlated with the Gleason score, suggesting a role in tumor differentiation (Shuvalov2021Emerging).

In the context of male infertility, variants in the SEMG gene, which includes SEMG2, have been linked to idiopathic male infertility in the Chinese-Han population. Specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the SEMG gene are associated with abnormal semen parameters, indicating a potential role in sperm motility and fertility issues (Wu2019Association). These findings suggest that SEMG2 may serve as a biomarker for certain cancers and as a target for genetic screening in infertility diagnosis.

## Interactions
SEMG2 (semenogelin 2) is known to participate in several protein interactions, particularly in the context of cancer cell metabolism. It interacts with pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), a key enzyme in glycolysis, enhancing its protein levels and enzymatic activity, which contributes to increased glycolysis and respiration in cancer cells (Shuvalov2020SEMG12). This interaction is confirmed through GST pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Shuvalov2020SEMG12).

SEMG2 is also involved in RNA processing and splicing, as indicated by its interactions with proteins associated with these processes (Shuvalov2020SEMG12). Although SEMG2 interacts with fewer proteins compared to SEMG1, its specific interactions with PKM2 and involvement in RNA processing suggest a role in metabolic reprogramming and gene expression regulation in cancer cells (Shuvalov2020SEMG12).

In addition to its role in cancer, SEMG2 is a substrate for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in seminal fluid, where it undergoes cleavage to facilitate semen liquefaction, although the specific peptides resulting from this cleavage are not well-documented (Shuvalov2021Emerging).
