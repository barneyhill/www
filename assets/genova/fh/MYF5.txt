# MYF5

## Overview
The MYF5 gene encodes the myogenic factor 5 protein, a critical transcription factor within the myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) family, characterized by a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain. This domain is essential for DNA binding and dimerization, playing a pivotal role in muscle differentiation and development (Zammit2017Function; Buonanno1992The). MYF5 is integral to the early specification of muscle cells, directing progenitor cells towards the skeletal muscle lineage and facilitating muscle regeneration in adults (Zammit2017Function). The protein's function is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which are crucial for its activity and stability (Winter1997Two). Clinically, mutations in the MYF5 gene are linked to external ophthalmoplegia with rib and vertebral anomalies (EORVA), underscoring its importance in muscle and skeletal development (Li2022Case; Ocieczek2024Identification).

## Structure
The MYF5 protein is a member of the myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) and is characterized by a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain, which is essential for DNA binding and dimerization. This domain is highly conserved across species, indicating its critical role in muscle differentiation (Zammit2017Function; Buonanno1992The). The bHLH motif includes an α-helical basic domain and two helices (Helix I and II) that facilitate stable protein-DNA interactions (Zammit2017Function).

The primary structure of MYF5 consists of a sequence of amino acids, with specific regions such as the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains potentially involved in transcription activation (Buonanno1992The). The protein also contains phosphorylation sites, notably at serine residues 49 and 133, which are crucial for its activity. These sites are phosphorylated by protein kinase CK2, and mutations at these sites can significantly affect MYF5's function, suggesting their role in transactivation and nuclear translocation (Winter1997Two).

The MYF5 protein's structure and post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are vital for its function as a transcription factor in muscle development and differentiation (Winter1997Two).

## Function
MYF5 is a myogenic regulatory factor that plays a crucial role in the development and regeneration of skeletal muscle. It is involved in the early specification of muscle cells, acting as a myogenic determination factor that directs progenitor cells to establish the skeletal muscle lineage (Zammit2017Function). MYF5 is expressed in quiescent satellite cells in adults and is rapidly up-regulated upon satellite cell activation, indicating its role in the early stages of muscle regeneration (Zammit2017Function). 

In the context of developmental myogenesis, MYF5 is directly induced by Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling, which is essential for its expression in the epaxial myotome. It is hierarchically above MyoD, as MyoD is not expressed in the absence of MYF5 and Pax3 (Francetic2011Skeletal). MYF5 is also involved in the regulation of muscle precursor cells and is expressed in the epaxial dermomyotome of the somite (Francetic2011Skeletal).

In adult muscle, MYF5 supports efficient regeneration by enabling transient myoblast amplification. Its absence leads to a slower pace of muscle regeneration, although it is not essential for the process, as other myogenic factors can compensate (Zammit2017Function; Ustanina2007The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MYF5 gene are associated with a rare autosomal recessive condition known as external ophthalmoplegia with rib and vertebral anomalies (EORVA). This disorder is characterized by congenital, non-progressive ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, scoliosis, torticollis, and rib anomalies. The primary pathology in EORVA is muscular, distinguishing it from other conditions like congenital fibrosis of extraocular muscles, which are primarily neurological (Li2022Case; Ocieczek2024Identification).

Specific mutations in MYF5, such as the p.Arg95Cys missense mutation and frameshift mutations like c.23_32delAGTTCTCACC, have been identified in affected individuals. These mutations impair the nuclear localization and transcriptional activity of the MYF5 protein, crucial for its function in muscle development. The p.Arg95Cys mutation, in particular, affects DNA binding due to the loss of hydrogen bonds, leading to developmental anomalies in the eyes, ribs, and spine (Di2018Recessive).

In mouse models, MYF5 mutations result in severe phenotypes, including absent extraocular muscles and rib anomalies, highlighting the gene's critical role in muscle and skeletal development. The severity of these phenotypes can vary, suggesting the influence of genetic or environmental modifiers (Di2018Recessive).

## Interactions
MYF5 interacts with MEF2 proteins to form a transcription factor complex essential for the activation of the myogenin gene. MEF2 binds to its specific DNA sequence and recruits MYF5, which does not bind directly to the promoter, to initiate or stabilize transcription. This interaction is crucial for MYF5-mediated transcriptional activation, as MEF2 alone cannot activate the myogenin promoter without MYF5 (Johanson1999Transcriptional). The adenovirus E1A protein can inhibit this interaction by targeting MEF2, thereby repressing the transcriptional activation of the myogenin gene (Johanson1999Transcriptional).

MYF5 also undergoes phosphorylation at specific sites, such as Ser 49 and Ser 133, which are crucial for its activity. These phosphorylation events, mediated by protein kinase CK2, are necessary for MYF5's function beyond DNA binding, potentially affecting its nuclear translocation or stability (Winter1997Two). During mitosis, MYF5 is degraded through a ubiquitin and proteasome-dependent process, which involves multiple phosphorylation events that enhance its recognition by an E3 ligase (Doucet2005Multiple).
