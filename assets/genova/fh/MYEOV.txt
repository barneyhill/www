# MYEOV

## Overview
The MYEOV gene encodes the myeloma overexpressed protein, which is implicated in various cancer-related processes. This protein is not classified as a kinase, receptor, or transmembrane protein, but it plays a crucial role in modulating transcriptional networks and signaling pathways associated with tumorigenesis. MYEOV is notably overexpressed in several cancers, including pancreatic, breast, colorectal, gastric, and multiple myeloma, where it contributes to cancer progression and poor prognosis (Tange2023MYEOV; Janssen2002MYEOV:). The protein interacts with key transcription factors and signaling molecules, such as MYC and components of the mTORC1 pathway, to enhance oncogenic pathways and cellular proliferation (Tange2023MYEOV; Shen2021The). Given its significant role in cancer biology, MYEOV is considered a potential therapeutic target and prognostic marker in oncology (Chen2022Identification; Leyden2006Net1).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The MYEOV gene is significantly overexpressed in several cancers, including pancreatic, breast, colorectal, gastric, and multiple myeloma. In pancreatic cancer, MYEOV overexpression is linked to poor prognosis, shorter survival times, and is considered an independent prognostic factor. This overexpression is often due to demethylation of its promoter region, which activates oncogenic pathways such as the folate cycle/c-myc/mtorc1 pathway, contributing to cancer progression (Tange2023MYEOV). MYEOV also acts as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) in pancreatic cancer, interacting with microRNAs and influencing immune cell infiltration, which may promote an immunosuppressive environment (Chen2022Identification).

In colorectal cancer, MYEOV is associated with increased cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, and its expression is regulated by Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a factor in colorectal carcinogenesis (Lawlor2010MYEOV). In gastric cancer, MYEOV is overexpressed and contributes to cell proliferation, suggesting its role as a potential therapeutic target (Leyden2006Net1). The gene's amplification and expression are also linked to breast cancer progression, indicating its clinical significance in prognosis and as a therapeutic target (Janssen2002MYEOV:).

## Interactions
MYEOV interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in pancreatic cancer progression. It forms a complex with the transcription factor MYC in the nucleus, which enhances MYC's transcriptional regulation of miR-17-5p and miR-93-5p by recruiting chromatin-modifying complexes to increase DNA accessibility (Shen2021The). This interaction is crucial for the upregulation of these oncogenic miRNAs, contributing to tumorigenesis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (Shen2021The).

MYEOV is also involved in the activation of the c-Myc and mTORC1 pathways, which are essential for cancer cell proliferation. Knockdown of MYEOV leads to the upregulation of MXD4 and CASTOR2, which are known to suppress c-Myc and mTORC1 activity, respectively (Tange2023MYEOV). This suggests that MYEOV may interact with components of these pathways to promote cancer progression.

Additionally, MYEOV has been shown to bind to HES1, promoting SOX9 transcriptional activation, although the precise nature of these interactions remains unclear (Tange2023MYEOV). These interactions highlight MYEOV's role in modulating key signaling pathways and transcriptional networks in cancer.
