# BEX1

## Overview
BEX1, or brain expressed X-linked 1, is a gene that encodes an intrinsically disordered protein involved in various cellular processes, including ciliogenesis and cell division. The BEX1 protein lacks stable secondary and tertiary structures, which allows it to participate in dynamic interactions with other proteins and cellular components. It plays a critical role in the formation and maintenance of primary cilia, essential for cellular signaling and sensory functions, by facilitating tubulin polymerization. BEX1 is also implicated in neurotrophin signaling through its interaction with the p75 neurotrophin receptor, influencing neuronal differentiation and cell cycle regulation. Clinically, BEX1 is associated with several diseases, acting as a tumor suppressor in acute myeloid leukemia while exhibiting oncogenic properties in certain lung cancers. Its expression and function are regulated by various mechanisms, including interactions with long noncoding RNAs and post-translational modifications (Hibino2022Bex1; Lindblad2015BEX1; Vilar2006Bex1).

## Structure
The BEX1 protein is characterized as an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP), lacking stable secondary and tertiary structures. This is due to its amino acid composition and the presence of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), which make up 54% of its length (Hibino2022Bex1). The protein does not contain any predicted functional domains, and its structure is primarily a random coil state under physiological conditions, as indicated by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (2D-NMR) spectroscopy (Hibino2022Bex1). The CD spectrum of BEX1 shows a negative peak around 200 nm, typical of IDPs, and the 2D-NMR spectrum reveals a narrow range of 1H chemical shifts, suggesting a lack of stable tertiary structures (Hibino2022Bex1).

BEX1 contains a CAAX box at the C-terminal end, a motif often involved in post-translational modifications such as prenylation, which can influence the protein's localization and function (Yang2002Cloningandexpressionpatternofaspermatogenesisrelatedgene). The protein's interaction with GTP, essential for tubulin polymerization, has been demonstrated, although direct interaction with tubulin has not been detected (Hibino2022Bex1).

## Function
The BEX1 protein is crucial for ciliogenesis, the process of cilia formation, which is essential for cellular signaling and sensory functions. BEX1 is an intrinsically disordered protein that can form biomolecular condensates, facilitating the polymerization of tubulin, a key component of microtubules in primary cilia (Hibino2022Bex1). It binds guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to promote microtubule polymerization, which is vital for the formation and maintenance of primary cilia (Hibino2022Bex1). BEX1 localizes to the nucleoli or the apical side of cells depending on cell density, associating with tubulin fibers and colocalizing with primary cilia, indicating its role in maintaining apicobasal polarity and epithelial cell structure (Hibino2022Bex1).

In addition to its role in ciliogenesis, BEX1 is involved in cell division, particularly in cytokinesis, where its depletion can lead to abscission failure and the formation of supernumerary cilia (Hibino2022Bex1). BEX1's function is tissue-specific, with significant roles in the retina, cerebellum, and kidney, where its absence leads to ciliopathy phenotypes (Hibino2022Bex1). These functions underscore BEX1's importance in cellular homeostasis and organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the BEX1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In ciliogenesis, BEX1 is essential for the formation and maintenance of primary cilia. Mutations in BEX1 can lead to ciliopathy phenotypes, such as ocular dysgenesis, polycystic kidney disease, and cerebellar hypoplasia, due to impaired ciliary function. These mutations particularly affect primary cilia in the retina and striatum, resulting in disoriented epithelial structures and cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, with female mutants showing more severe symptoms (Hibino2022Bex1).

In cancer, BEX1 acts as a tumor suppressor in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), especially in patients with the FLT3-ITD mutation. Loss of BEX1 expression is associated with poor survival, as it correlates with the upregulation of oncogenic pathways and contributes to chemoresistance (Lindblad2015BEX1). Conversely, in lung adenocarcinoma and malignant pleural mesothelioma, BEX1 is overexpressed and promotes cell proliferation and invasion, suggesting its role as an oncogene in these contexts (em&gt; Bex1&lt; Doi2020&lt).

In colorectal cancer, BEX1 expression is negatively regulated by the long noncoding RNA LINC00630, contributing to radio-resistance through promoter methylation (Liu2020Long).

## Interactions
BEX1 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It interacts with the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75 NTR), linking neurotrophin signaling to the cell cycle. This interaction is crucial for BEX1's nucleocytoplasmic trafficking and is not affected by nerve growth factor (NGF) binding, suggesting BEX1 may act as an upstream regulator of p75 NTR function (Vilar2006Bex1). BEX1 also competes with RIP2 for binding to p75 NTR, affecting NF-kB activation and neuronal differentiation (Vilar2006Bex1).

BEX1 interacts with the olfactory marker protein (OMP) and BCL-2, with these interactions involving disorder-to-order transitions, such as adopting an α-helix conformation upon binding (Fernandez2015Brain). In cancer-related pathways, BEX1 interacts with proteins like CALML3-6, LDB1, and LMO2, influencing pathways such as Gastric Acid Secretion and Insulin signaling (Rezaei2024Unveiling). BEX1's interaction with PICK1 is significant in the homeostasis signaling pathway, impacting vascular wall stability (Rezaei2024Unveiling). These interactions highlight BEX1's role as a regulatory protein in various signaling pathways.
