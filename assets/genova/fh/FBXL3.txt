# FBXL3

## Overview
FBXL3 is a gene that encodes the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3, a crucial component of the SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This protein plays a significant role in the regulation of circadian rhythms by targeting cryptochrome proteins CRY1 and CRY2 for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. As a result, FBXL3 is integral to the maintenance of the circadian clock's negative-feedback loop, which is essential for the proper timing and amplitude of circadian oscillations in mammals (Busino2007SCF; Siepka2007Circadian). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences the transcriptional activity of CLOCK/BMAL1, key components of the circadian clock machinery (Siepka2007Circadian). Mutations in the FBXL3 gene can lead to disruptions in circadian rhythms, with implications for various sleep and metabolic disorders (Maywood2011Tuning; Siepka2007Circadian).

## Function
FBXL3 is a crucial component of the SCF (Skp1/Cullin/F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which is involved in the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins, specifically cryptochrome proteins Cry1 and Cry2. These cryptochrome proteins are integral components of the circadian clock in mammals, where they inhibit the Clock-Bmal1 transcription complex, forming a negative-feedback loop essential for circadian rhythm oscillations (Busino2007SCF). 

In healthy human cells, FBXL3 promotes the degradation of Cry1 and Cry2, which is necessary for the reactivation of Clock-Bmal1 and the expression of Per1 and Per2 genes. This process ensures the proper timing and amplitude of circadian oscillations, which are vital for maintaining circadian homeostasis (Busino2007SCF). The degradation of Cry proteins by FBXL3 is crucial for the balance between activation and repression of clock gene transcription, which is necessary for generating circadian rhythmicity (Siepka2007Circadian).

FBXL3 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it facilitates the steady-state turnover of CRY proteins via proteasomal degradation, thus influencing the transcriptional activity of CLOCK/BMAL1, key components of the circadian clock machinery (Siepka2007Circadian).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FBXL3 gene have significant implications for circadian rhythm regulation, which can lead to various disorders. The FBXL3 gene encodes a protein that is part of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box-protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, crucial for the degradation of CRY proteins, key components of the circadian clock. Mutations such as the Overtime (Ovtm) mutation, which involves an isoleucine to threonine substitution at position 364 (I364T), result in a loss of function of FBXL3. This mutation leads to the stabilization of CRY proteins and a reduction in the expression of PERIOD proteins (PER1 and PER2), causing a lengthened circadian period of approximately 26 hours (Siepka2007Circadian). 

The FBXL3 Afh mutation similarly affects CRY protein stability, leading to a lengthened circadian period. This mutation has been studied in conjunction with the CK1 Tau mutation, which affects PER protein stability, revealing that these mutations independently and additively influence circadian behavior (Maywood2011Tuning). These disruptions in circadian rhythms have implications for sleep and metabolic disorders, as the circadian clock is a critical regulator of sleep/wake cycles and other physiological processes (Maywood2011Tuning).

## Interactions
FBXL3 is a component of the SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of circadian rhythms by targeting cryptochrome proteins CRY1 and CRY2 for degradation. This interaction is essential for the reactivation of the Clock-Bmal1 transcription complex, which regulates the expression of circadian clock genes such as Per1 and Per2 (Busino2007SCF). FBXL3 specifically binds to CRY1 and CRY2, but not to other F-box proteins like Skp2, Fbxl10, or β-TrCP1, indicating a selective interaction (Busino2007SCF; Smialowski2009The).

The interaction between FBXL3 and cryptochrome proteins is mediated by the CRY binding domain (CBD), which is conserved across species, as demonstrated in both human and ovine models (Dardente2008Implication). Mutations in FBXL3, such as Cys 358 → Ser (C358S), can affect its ability to bind and degrade CRY proteins, leading to altered circadian rhythms (Busino2007SCF). FBXL3 does not have direct interactions with nucleic acids, as its primary role involves protein-protein interactions within the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Yoshida2010Augmentation).
