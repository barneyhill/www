# KLHDC2

## Overview
KLHDC2 is a human gene that encodes the protein kelch domain containing 2, which is characterized by its kelch repeat motifs. These motifs facilitate protein-protein interactions, allowing KLHDC2 to function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase within the CRL2 complex, a crucial component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Hickey2024Coopting). The protein adopts a six-bladed beta-propeller structure, enabling it to recognize and bind specific C-terminal degrons, particularly those ending in glycine, thus targeting them for degradation (Rusnac2018Recognition). KLHDC2 is predominantly located in the nucleus and is highly expressed in tissues such as skeletal muscle and heart, where it plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation and protein homeostasis (Chin2006Differential). Its involvement in targeted protein degradation has made it a focal point in the development of PROTAC technology, highlighting its potential in therapeutic applications (Hickey2024Coopting).

## Structure
The KLHDC2 protein is characterized by the presence of kelch motifs, which are involved in protein-protein interactions. It is composed entirely of six kelch repeats, forming a β-propeller structure with four-stranded antiparallel β sheets (Chin2006Differential). The protein adopts a six-bladed beta-propeller fold, with each blade consisting of four antiparallel beta strands. The loops linking these strands create a deep binding pocket that recognizes the C-end degron (Rusnac2018Recognition).

The KLHDC2 protein forms a stable complex with the SelK degron peptide, highlighting its role as a substrate receptor within the CRL2 E3 complex. This interaction is facilitated by a binding pocket approximately 16 Å long and 12 Å wide, divided into two chambers by a low ridge (Rusnac2018Recognition). The protein's quaternary structure involves forming a tetrameric complex with EloB and EloC, known as the KBC complex, which predominantly forms tetramers with a symmetric arrangement described as a dimer of dimers (Hickey2024Coopting).

KLHDC2 is involved in targeted protein degradation, and its structure allows for dynamic oligomerization, which can be modulated by small molecules targeting its substrate-binding pocket (Hickey2024Coopting). The protein's C-terminal region plays a role in its oligomeric state and substrate interactions (Hickey2024Coopting).

## Function
KLHDC2 is a human gene encoding a kelch repeat protein that plays a significant role in cellular processes, particularly in transcriptional regulation and protein degradation. In healthy human cells, KLHDC2 is predominantly located in the nucleus and is highly expressed in tissues such as skeletal muscle and heart (Chin2006Differential). It interacts with and inhibits the transcription factor LZIP, which is part of the CREB3 subfamily known for its tumor suppressive activity. This interaction suggests that KLHDC2 may influence cell proliferation by inhibiting LZIP-dependent transcription (Chin2006Differential).

KLHDC2 is also involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), functioning as an E3 ligase within the CRL2 complex. It targets proteins with specific C-terminal sequences, particularly those ending in glycine, for degradation. This process involves the recognition of degrons, sequences that promote degradation, with KLHDC2 recognizing and binding to substrates ending in a diglycine motif (Hickey2024Coopting). KLHDC2's role in targeted protein degradation is further highlighted by its use in PROTAC technology, where it facilitates the degradation of specific proteins, such as BRD4, by forming a ternary complex with the target protein (Hickey2024Coopting). This activity underscores its importance in maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating cellular processes.

## Interactions
KLHDC2 is a human E3 ubiquitin ligase that participates in various protein interactions, primarily through its role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. It forms a tetrameric complex with EloB and EloC, described as a dimer of dimers, where specific residues such as Leu364, Ser366, and Val372 mediate these interactions (Hickey2024Coopting). The C-terminal regions of KLHDC2, known as BC and Cullin boxes, are crucial for these interactions, contributing to the stability of the tetrameric structure (Hickey2024Coopting).

KLHDC2 also interacts with substrates through its beta propeller domain, recognizing peptides with a C-terminal diglycine motif (Kim2023Targeted). This interaction is characterized by a strong binding affinity, with a dissociation constant of less than 20 nM (Kim2023Targeted). KLHDC2's interaction with BRD proteins, specifically BRD3, involves electrostatic interactions, with the R56 residue of KLHDC2 complementing the E344 residue of BRD3 (Scott2024Principles).

Additionally, KLHDC2 can be targeted by small molecules like KDRLKZ-1, which mimic natural substrate interactions, forming hydrogen bonds and salt bridges within the substrate-binding pocket (Hickey2024Coopting). These interactions highlight KLHDC2's role in targeted protein degradation, making it a promising target for developing PROTACs and other therapeutic strategies (Scott2024Principles).
