# WDR77

## Overview
WDR77 is a gene that encodes the WD repeat domain 77 protein, also known as p44, which is a member of the WD repeat protein family. This protein is characterized by its WD repeat motifs, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, making it a versatile participant in various cellular processes. The WD repeat domain 77 protein is primarily involved in cell cycle regulation, RNA processing, and transcriptional modulation, particularly in the context of prostate epithelial cell differentiation and proliferation (Gu2011Nuclear; Altayyar2020WD). It functions as a cofactor for the androgen receptor, influencing gene expression related to prostate growth and differentiation. Additionally, WDR77 forms a complex with protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), playing a significant role in histone modification and cancer cell proliferation (Qi2018Sirtuin). The protein's interactions extend to viral replication processes and tumor suppression, highlighting its multifaceted role in both normal cellular function and disease states (Ju2023The; Li2016Yeast).

## Function
The WDR77 gene encodes the p44/WDR77 protein, which plays a crucial role in cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and RNA processing. In healthy human cells, particularly in the prostate gland, p44/WDR77 is essential for the differentiation of prostate epithelial cells. It acts as a cofactor for the androgen receptor (AR), modulating AR target gene expression, which contributes to prostate growth and differentiation (Gu2011Nuclear). The protein contains nuclear localization signals (NLS) and nuclear exclusion signals (NES) that regulate its subcellular localization, which is critical for its function. During early prostate development, p44/WDR77 is found in the cytoplasm, facilitating cell proliferation, and later translocates to the nucleus in adult prostate cells, where it is associated with decreased proliferation and increased differentiation (Gu2011Nuclear).

WDR77 also regulates the translation of E2F1 and E2F3 mRNAs, which are important for cellular proliferation. It interacts with PDCD4 to prevent it from inhibiting the helicase activity of eIF4A1, necessary for the translation of mRNAs with structured 5'UTRs, such as E2F1 and E2F3. This regulation is significant for the initiation of DNA replication, as E2F transcription factors are involved in the G1/S transition of the cell cycle (Altayyar2020WD).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the WDR77 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In gliomas, elevated WDR77 expression is associated with poor prognostic outcomes, particularly in high-grade gliomas and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). It is an independent prognostic factor, correlating with decreased overall survival rates and increased immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment (Lu2023Deciphering).

In lung cancer, WDR77, also known as p44, is highly expressed in several lung cancer cell lines and is necessary for the growth of lung adenocarcinoma cells. Silencing WDR77 expression significantly reduces lung cancer cell proliferation, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Gu2012The).

WDR77 is also involved in familial papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), where germline loss-of-function variants disrupt its interaction with PRMT5, leading to increased cancer cell growth. These mutations are associated with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern of PTC (Jiang2024Chromosomal; SánchezAres2022Susceptibility).

In prostate cancer, WDR77 is reactivated and translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, promoting cancer cell proliferation. Its interaction with PRMT5 is crucial for cell growth, and alterations in this interaction can significantly impact cancer progression (Qi2018Sirtuin; Altayyar2020WD).

## Interactions
WDR77, also known as WD repeat domain 77, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It forms a complex with protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), which is crucial for the methylation of arginines on histones, particularly H4R3me2, a modification linked to cancer cell proliferation. SIRT7, a member of the sirtuin family, deacetylates WDR77 at specific lysine residues, reducing its interaction with PRMT5 and subsequently decreasing the transmethylase activity of the WDR77/PRMT5 complex, leading to decreased cancer cell growth (Qi2018Sirtuin).

WDR77 also interacts with E2F1 and E2F3 proteins, which are transcriptional activators involved in cell cycle progression and DNA replication. This interaction occurs at the translational level, where WDR77, along with PRMT5, regulates the translation of E2F1 and E2F3 mRNAs through their 5' UTRs (Altayyar2020WD).

Additionally, WDR77 interacts with the hepatitis E virus (HEV) ORF1 protein, where it is involved in inhibiting HEV genomic RNA replication. This interaction highlights WDR77's role in viral replication processes (Ju2023The). WDR77 is also identified as a novel interacting partner of TSC22D2, a protein involved in tumor suppression and cell cycle regulation (Li2016Yeast).
