# GOLGA4

## Overview
GOLGA4 is a gene that encodes the protein golgin A4, also known as golgin-245 or p230, which is a peripheral membrane protein associated with the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Golgin A4 plays a critical role in vesicle tethering and transport, particularly in the endosome-to-TGN retrograde transport pathway. It is characterized by its interaction with the small GTPase Arl1 through its GRIP domain, which is essential for its localization and function within the Golgi apparatus (Ireland2020Hydrogen; Kakinuma2003Human). The protein is involved in maintaining Golgi structure and function, contributing to cellular organization and secretion processes (Bekpen2019Human). GOLGA4 has clinical significance, as it is implicated in autoimmune responses and certain oncogenic processes, such as the GOLGA4-RAF1 fusion in cutaneous melanoma (McEvoy2019Profound; D’Souza2021Getting).

## Function
The GOLGA4 gene encodes a protein known as Golgin 245 or p230, which is a peripheral membrane protein associated with the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and vesicles budding from the TGN. This protein is involved in protein trafficking from the TGN, cycling between the cytosol and membranes of the TGN and nonclathrin-coated budding vesicles in a G protein-regulated manner (Kakinuma2003Human). The protein consists of three domains: a flexible proline-rich amino terminal domain, a rigid central α-helical coiled-coil domain, and a flexible carboxyl terminal domain. The carboxyl terminal domain contains a Golgi localization domain (GLD), also known as the GRIP domain, which is crucial for its localization to the Golgi (Kakinuma2003Human).

GOLGA4 is postulated to play a role in Rab6-regulated membrane-tethering events in the Golgi apparatus, contributing to the maintenance of Golgi structure and function (Meyer2009An). The protein's involvement in vesicle tethering and trafficking is essential for proper protein and lipid transport within cells, ensuring cellular organization and secretion processes (Bekpen2019Human). The absence of the GRIP domain in certain fusion proteins, such as GOLGA4-RAF1, highlights its importance in Golgi recruitment and function (McEvoy2019Profound).

## Clinical Significance
The GOLGA4 gene, encoding golgin-245, has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to its role in Golgi apparatus function and cellular trafficking. In patients with Sjögren's syndrome, GOLGA4 is identified as an autoantigen, suggesting its involvement in autoimmune responses (D’Souza2021Getting). Alterations in GOLGA4 expression or function can lead to disruptions in Golgi structure, as seen in HeLa cells where depletion of golgin-245 results in Golgi fragmentation and impaired transport of cargo to the cell surface (D’Souza2021Getting).

A notable clinical significance of GOLGA4 is its involvement in a rare genetic fusion with the RAF1 gene, known as the GOLGA4-RAF1 fusion. This fusion has been identified in cutaneous melanoma, where it acts as an oncogenic driver by activating the MAPK pathway, leading to increased expression of phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK) and contributing to tumor progression. Patients with this fusion have shown significant responses to MEK inhibitor therapy, although the response may be transient (McEvoy2019Profound).

The loss of GOLGA4, along with other genes, has also been observed in a Lynch syndrome family, potentially contributing to an unusual tumor spectrum due to impaired mismatch repair (Meyer2009An).

## Interactions
GOLGA4, also known as golgin-245 or p230, is a peripheral membrane protein associated with the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and is involved in vesicle tethering and transport. It interacts with vesicles at the TGN, playing a crucial role in endosome-to-TGN retrograde transport (Hollingsworth2024Spatiotemporal). GOLGA4 is anchored to the trans-Golgi by its GRIP domain, which interacts with Arl1, a small GTPase localized on trans-Golgi membranes. This interaction is essential for maintaining Golgi structure and function, as depletion of Arl1 leads to the dissociation of GOLGA4 from the Golgi membranes (Ireland2020Hydrogen).

GOLGA4 is also associated with nonclathrin-coated TGN budding vesicles, suggesting its involvement in protein trafficking from the TGN (Kakinuma2003Human). The GARP vesicle tethering complex, particularly its subunit VPS54, colocalizes with GOLGA4, indicating a potential interaction or association within the Golgi apparatus (Khakurel2023Role). However, specific details on direct physical interactions of GOLGA4 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed in the available literature.
