# SUPT3H

## Overview
SUPT3H is a gene that encodes the SPT3 homolog, a component of the SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase) and STAGA transcription coactivator complexes. These complexes are integral to chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation, facilitating the transcription of RNA polymerase II-dependent genes. The SPT3 homolog protein, categorized as a transcriptional coactivator, is involved in modifying histones and recruiting transcription machinery, thereby influencing gene expression and cellular differentiation. It is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues and plays a significant role in transcriptional coactivation within the nucleus. The protein's involvement in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation underscores its importance in maintaining proper gene expression patterns and its potential role in epigenetic regulation during cell division (Santos2009Assessment; Nakamura2015Identification).

## Structure
The SUPT3H protein is a component of the human SAGA coactivator complex, which plays a crucial role in transcription activation and chromatin modification. Within the SAGA complex, SUPT3H contains two histone fold (HF) domains that form an H2A/H2B-like dimer, contributing to the core module's structure (Herbst2021Structure). This histone octamer-like fold is a conserved feature, also found in the general transcription factor IID (Zhang2022CryoEM). 

SUPT3H is involved in the coordination with TRRAP, a key component of the SAGA complex, through its helices and loop regions, which facilitate the association with TRRAP (Zhang2022CryoEM). The conserved TBP-binding pocket of SUPT3H is vacant, suggesting potential for TBP association, although this interaction is not well-documented in humans (Zhang2022CryoEM; Herbst2021Structure).

The protein is well conserved across mammals, particularly in the C-terminal region, which complicates predictions about the impact of structural changes on its function or stability (Norling2013Novel). The presence of splice variant isoforms has been noted, which may alter the protein's structure and function (Norling2013Novel).

## Function
The SUPT3H gene encodes a component of the SAGA and STAGA transcription coactivator complexes, which are crucial for chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation. These complexes facilitate the transcription of RNA polymerase II-dependent genes by modifying histones and recruiting transcription machinery, thereby influencing gene expression and cellular differentiation (Santos2009Assessment; Nakamura2015Identification). SUPT3H is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues and is active in the nucleus, where it plays a significant role in transcriptional coactivation (Nakamura2015Identification).

In healthy human cells, SUPT3H is involved in various molecular processes, including chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation, which are essential for maintaining proper gene expression patterns. It is particularly expressed in testicular cells, such as Leydig, interstitial, and germ cells, indicating its potential role in reproductive biology (Norling2013Novel). The gene's involvement in chromatin remodeling suggests it may contribute to the retention of gene expression patterns after mitosis and participate in epigenetic regulation during cell division (Santos2009Assessment). Additionally, SUPT3H has been implicated in immune-related functions, such as lymphocyte differentiation and activation, highlighting its role in immunometabolism (CrespoPiazuelo2021A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SUPT3H gene have been implicated in several conditions, particularly those related to bone and cartilage. Variants in the SUPT3H gene have shown a nominally significant association with otosclerosis, a condition affecting the bones of the middle ear, leading to hearing loss (Tavernier2022Targeted). Additionally, the SUPT3H-RUNX2 region has been associated with hip osteoarthritis (OA) and other musculoskeletal phenotypes, such as bone mineral density and cartilage thickness (CastañoBetancourt2016Novel). The SNP rs12206662 in this region is notably associated with hip OA, suggesting that genetic variants in the SUPT3H-RUNX2 region could influence multiple traits (CastañoBetancourt2016Novel).

In the context of osteoblast differentiation, the lncRNA lnc-SUPT3H-1:16 is upregulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH) and acts as a sponge to protect the RUNX2 gene from miR-6797-5p, promoting osteoblast differentiation (Arumugam2019Parathyroid). This regulatory mechanism highlights the potential role of SUPT3H in bone-related diseases. Furthermore, SUPT3H has been identified as a significant factor in machine learning models predicting knee OA progression, indicating its potential as a genetic biomarker for osteoarthritis (Bonakdari2022Single).

## Interactions
SUPT3H is a component of the human SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase) transcriptional coactivator complex, which is involved in transcription regulation and chromatin modification. Within the SAGA complex, SUPT3H is part of the core module and interacts with several other proteins. It contains two histone fold (HF) domains that form an H2A/H2B-like dimer, similar to its yeast counterpart, although the specific interaction with the TATA-binding protein (TBP) seen in yeast is not well-established in humans (Herbst2021Structure). SUPT3H interacts with TRRAP and other proteins such as SUPT7L, TADA1, TAF9, TAF10, and TAF12, coordinating the association within the complex (Zhang2022CryoEM). The conserved TBP-binding pocket of SUPT3H is vacant, suggesting potential for TBP association, although an Spt8 homolog, which aids TBP binding in yeast, is absent in humans (Zhang2022CryoEM). Despite its structural positioning in a region where TBP binds in yeast, alternative conformations in humans suggest that SUPT3H's interaction with TBP is not clearly defined (Herbst2021Structure). The role of SUPT3H in the SAGA complex highlights its importance in transcriptional regulation, although specific physical interactions with nucleic acids remain to be fully elucidated.
