# HDGF

## Overview
Hepatoma-Derived Growth Factor (HDGF) is a gene that encodes a heparin-binding protein involved in various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and migration. The HDGF protein is characterized by a structured N-terminal HATH domain, also known as the PWWP domain, which facilitates heparin and DNA binding, and a disordered C-terminal domain that may allow for diverse regulatory functions (Chen2018Domain; Sue2004Solution). HDGF is ubiquitously expressed in normal human tissues, such as the heart, brain, and liver, and is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, with significant nuclear presence suggesting roles in both autocrine and paracrine signaling (Nakamura1994Molecular; Everett2000Hepatomaderived). The protein is implicated in the activation of signaling pathways like PI3K/Akt, contributing to its involvement in cell motility and cancer progression (Kung2012Hepatomaderived). Alterations in HDGF expression are associated with various malignancies, making it a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target in oncology (Hu2003Expression; Han2023HDGF).

## Structure
The human hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) protein is characterized by a structured N-terminal HATH domain and a disordered C-terminal domain. The HATH domain, also known as the PWWP domain, is approximately 100 amino acids long and features a five-stranded beta-barrel followed by two alpha-helices. This domain is responsible for heparin binding, facilitated by a positively charged region formed by lysine and arginine residues (Sue2004Solution). The PWWP domain is involved in DNA binding and undergoes domain swapping upon DNA interaction, transforming from a monomeric to a dimeric structure, which enhances its binding affinity (Chen2018Domain).

The C-terminal domain of HDGF is disordered, which may allow it to assume different conformations upon binding to various targets, playing a role in the protein's regulatory functions (Sue2004Solution). HDGF is known to undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and function (Chen2012Significance). Multiple splice variants of HDGF exist, contributing to its diverse biological roles (Nakamura1994Molecular).

## Function
Hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) is a heparin-binding protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. In healthy human cells, HDGF is known for its mitogenic activity, which is crucial for cell proliferation and development. It is a nuclear-targeted mitogen that shows activity in various cell types, such as hepatic, gastric, fibroblast, endothelial, smooth muscle, and neuronal cells, after translocation to the nucleus (Li2013Downregulated). HDGF is expressed ubiquitously in normal organs, including the heart, brain, lung, liver, muscle, kidney, and pancreas, indicating its widespread role in cellular functions (Nakamura1994Molecular).

HDGF is primarily localized in the cytoplasm but is also found in the nucleus, suggesting it may function through both autocrine and paracrine mechanisms (Everett2000Hepatomaderived). It is involved in stimulating DNA synthesis, as evidenced by its ability to promote cell proliferation in smooth muscle cells and other cell types (Everett2000Hepatomaderived). The protein's growth-stimulating activity is linked to its nuclear localization, where it may act as a signaling molecule or trophic factor under certain conditions (Gallitzendoerfer2008Hepatoma‐derived). Despite its significant roles in cellular processes, the exact function of HDGF in healthy cells remains not fully understood.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the HDGF gene are associated with various malignancies and poor clinical outcomes. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), elevated HDGF levels correlate with poor differentiation, absence of tumor capsules, and higher recurrence rates, making it an independent prognostic factor for survival (Hu2003Expression). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), high HDGF expression is linked to increased tumor aggressiveness, higher relapse rates, and shorter survival times. HDGF also contributes to gefitinib resistance by activating the PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK signaling pathways, suggesting its role in drug resistance (Zhang2006Downregulation; Han2023HDGF).

In digestive malignancies, HDGF is associated with aggressive tumor characteristics and poor prognosis in cancers such as gastric, colorectal, and esophageal cancer (Enomoto2020HepatomaDerived). Its overexpression promotes tumor proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis, often through interactions with growth factors like VEGF (Enomoto2020HepatomaDerived). In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), nuclear HDGF expression is linked to shorter survival, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Hsu2011Tumorigenesis). These findings underscore HDGF's significant role in cancer progression and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
Hepatoma-Derived Growth Factor (HDGF) is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, influencing cellular processes such as cell motility, angiogenesis, and fibrosis. HDGF activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell motility and cytoskeletal reorganization. This interaction leads to the formation of structures like dorsal ruffles and podosome rosettes, enhancing cell migration (Kung2012Hepatomaderived).

In oral cancer, HDGF interacts with Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) through the AKT/HIF-1α/NF-κB signaling pathway, promoting VEGF expression and release. This interaction is mediated by surface nucleolin, which transmits HDGF's oncogenic signaling. Neutralizing nucleolin or inhibiting HIF-1α can disrupt this pathway, highlighting the role of HDGF in cancer progression (Lin2019Novel).

In pancreatic stellate cells, HDGF is upregulated by the TGF-β1-activated CEBPD/HIF-1α axis, contributing to antiapoptotic and profibrotic effects. This axis involves transcriptional regulation where HIF-1α binds to the HDGF promoter, and CEBPD enhances TGF-β1 expression, forming a feedback loop. These interactions support extracellular matrix protein synthesis and stabilize tumor foci in pancreatic cancer (Chen2019Hepatomaderived).
