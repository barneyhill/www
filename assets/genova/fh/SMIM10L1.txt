# SMIM10L1

## Overview
SMIM10L1 is a gene that encodes the small integral membrane protein 10 like 1, which is a transmembrane protein. This protein is characterized by its role in cellular processes that involve membrane integration and signaling pathways. As a member of the small integral membrane protein family, SMIM10L1 is implicated in various biological functions, although its specific roles and mechanisms of action are still under investigation. The protein's involvement in cellular signaling suggests potential implications in health and disease, making it a subject of interest in biomedical research (Qiu2020aarFDC).
