# CCDC102A

## Overview
The CCDC102A gene encodes the protein coiled-coil domain containing 102A, which is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil motifs that are often involved in protein-protein interactions. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including those related to the cell cycle and cellular assembly, as evidenced by its involvement in cancer-related networks (Dudea-Simon2020Identification). The gene's expression and methylation patterns have been linked to several diseases, such as diabetic cataract and Type 2 Diabetes, indicating its potential role in metabolic disorders (Li2016Interactometranscriptome; CarrizosaMolina2023Methylation). Additionally, CCDC102A is a component of a prognostic model for acute myeloid leukemia, where its expression levels correlate with patient outcomes, highlighting its significance in cancer prognosis (Zhang2024Identification).

## Clinical Significance
The CCDC102A gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression and methylation patterns. In the context of metabolic disorders, genomic variations in the CCDC102A locus have been associated with diabetic cataract, highlighting its potential role in diabetic pathologies (CarrizosaMolina2023Methylation). Additionally, the gene is identified as a candidate in Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) studies, where its expression is repressed in T2D subjects, suggesting a link to the disease's genetic interactions (Li2016Interactometranscriptome).

In cancer research, CCDC102A is part of a prognostic risk-scoring model for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where high expression levels are associated with a higher risk and worse overall survival in patients. This model underscores the gene's significance as a risk factor in AML prognosis (Zhang2024Identification). Furthermore, CCDC102A is involved in networks related to cell cycle and cellular assembly in cervical cancer, although specific mutations or expression changes in this context are not detailed (Dudea-Simon2020Identification).

These findings suggest that CCDC102A plays a role in various pathological conditions, potentially through its involvement in critical cellular processes and pathways.
