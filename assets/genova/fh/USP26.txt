# USP26

## Overview
USP26, or ubiquitin specific peptidase 26, is a gene that encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme involved in the regulation of protein stability and cellular homeostasis. The protein ubiquitin specific peptidase 26 is categorized as a deubiquitinating enzyme, which functions by removing ubiquitin moieties from target proteins, thereby preventing their degradation. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including the regulation of the androgen receptor and the p53 tumor suppressor, as well as the modulation of the TGF-β signaling pathway. USP26 is also implicated in bone homeostasis and cellular reprogramming, highlighting its diverse functional roles. Clinically, mutations in the USP26 gene have been associated with male infertility and other reproductive health issues, although the significance of these associations varies across different populations (LahavBaratz2017The; Stouffs2004Possible; Kit2017USP; Li2022The; Ning2017USP26).

## Function
USP26 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 26) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a crucial role in regulating protein stability by removing ubiquitin moieties from target proteins, thereby preventing their degradation. In healthy human cells, USP26 is involved in several molecular processes and cellular functions. It stabilizes the ubiquitin ligase Mdm2, which is important for the regulation of the androgen receptor and the p53 tumor suppressor, by promoting its deubiquitination (LahavBaratz2017The). USP26 also plays a significant role in the TGF-β signaling pathway by deubiquitinating and stabilizing SMAD7, an inhibitor SMAD protein, which modulates the pathway's activity and maintains cellular homeostasis (Kit2017USP).

In the context of bone homeostasis, USP26 stabilizes β-catenin to promote osteogenic activity in mesenchymal stem cells and impairs osteoclastic differentiation by stabilizing inhibitors of NF-κBα, thus maintaining the balance between bone formation and resorption (Li2022The). Additionally, USP26 is involved in cellular reprogramming by stabilizing components of the polycomb-repressive complex 1, such as CBX4 and CBX6, which repress pluripotency genes and influence cell differentiation (Ning2017USP26). These diverse functions highlight USP26's role in maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating various cellular processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the USP26 gene have been associated with various forms of male infertility, including azoospermia and Sertoli cell-only syndrome (SCOS). Studies have identified specific mutations such as 370-371insACA, 494T>C, and 1423C>T, which are linked to SCOS and the absence of sperm in the ejaculate (Stouffs2004Possible; Ravel2006Haplotypes). These mutations may form a specific X chromosome haplotype, potentially contributing to male infertility (Asadpor2013Ubiquitinspecific).

The USP26 gene is also implicated in asthenoteratozoospermia, a condition characterized by reduced sperm motility and abnormal morphology. Novel mutations such as Arg825Gly and Asn799Ser have been identified, which may affect sperm structure and function (Liu2021Novel). Additionally, the 1090C>T mutation has been associated with inguinal hernia, suggesting a broader impact on male reproductive health (Ribarski2008USP26).

While some studies suggest a link between USP26 mutations and male infertility, the association remains controversial, with varying prevalence and significance reported across different populations (Dai2014Association). The gene's role in regulating androgen receptor signaling and protein turnover during spermatogenesis further underscores its clinical significance (Arafat2020Novel).

## Interactions
USP26 is a deubiquitinating enzyme that interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It binds to the ubiquitin ligase Mdm2, promoting its deubiquitination and stabilization. This interaction is crucial for regulating Mdm2, which is involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (LahavBaratz2017The).

USP26 also interacts with components of the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), specifically CBX4 and CBX6, in a RING1A-independent manner. These interactions suggest that USP26 regulates pluripotency and differentiation by modulating PRC1 components (Ning2017USP26).

In the TGF-β signaling pathway, USP26 deubiquitinates and stabilizes SMAD7, which acts as a scaffold to recruit the E3 ligase SMURF2, targeting the TGF-β receptor complex for degradation. This interaction positions USP26 as a negative regulator of TGF-β signaling (Kit2017USP).

USP26 also interacts with TAZ, a transcriptional coactivator in the Hippo signaling pathway, stabilizing it by removing K29- and K48-linked polyubiquitin chains. This interaction is significant in the progression of anaplastic thyroid cancer (Tang2022USP26).

Additionally, USP26 interacts with TRAF3, a component of the RIG-I/MAVS signaling pathway, affecting the K63-linked polyubiquitination of TRAF3 and modulating the immune response to EV71 infection (Sheng2024USP26).
