# TRIB1

## Overview
TRIB1 is a gene located on chromosome 8 that encodes the protein tribbles pseudokinase 1, a member of the tribbles family of pseudokinases. Unlike typical kinases, tribbles pseudokinase 1 lacks catalytic activity due to structural variations in its pseudokinase domain, such as the absence of ATP-binding capability (Murphy2015Molecular). Despite this, it plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell signaling, proliferation, and differentiation. The protein functions as an adapter, interacting with multiple signaling pathways, notably the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, where it modulates ERK phosphorylation and influences cellular outcomes like apoptosis and differentiation (Danger2022The). TRIB1 is also involved in lipid metabolism and immune cell differentiation, highlighting its diverse biological roles (Danger2022The; Iwamoto2015The). Its interactions with other proteins, such as E3 ubiquitin ligases and C/EBP transcription factors, underscore its regulatory functions in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Danger2022The; Jamieson2018Substrate).

## Structure
TRIB1, a member of the tribbles family of pseudokinases, is encoded by the TRIB1 gene on chromosome 8. The protein is composed of three domains: the N-terminal domain (AA 1-90), the central pseudokinase domain (AA 91-330), and the C-terminal domain (AA 331-373) (Singh2024“Oh). The N-terminal domain contains a nuclear localization signal and is rich in PEST sequences, which are not associated with instability (Singh2024“Oh). The central pseudokinase domain resembles the CAMK family but lacks ATP-binding capability due to structural differences, such as a bent αC helix and a divergent glycine-rich loop (Murphy2015Molecular). The DFG motif is replaced by an SLE sequence, preventing ATP binding and phosphoryl transfer (Singh2024“Oh; Murphy2015Molecular). The C-terminal domain contains motifs for protein-protein interactions, including binding sites for MEK1/2 and the COP1 E3 ubiquitin ligase (Singh2024“Oh).

TRIB1 functions primarily as a monomer, with its C-terminal tail interacting intramolecularly with the pseudokinase domain to increase stability (Murphy2015Molecular). This interaction is similar to autoinhibitory mechanisms seen in other kinases (Singh2024“Oh). The protein's structure undergoes conformational changes upon substrate binding, which relieves autoinhibition and facilitates interactions with substrates like C/EBPα/β (Jamieson2018Substrate).

## Function
The TRIB1 gene encodes a pseudokinase involved in various cellular processes, including cell signaling, proliferation, and differentiation. In healthy human cells, TRIB1 plays a significant role in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. It enhances ERK phosphorylation, thereby suppressing apoptosis and influencing MEK1/ERK activity (Danger2022The). TRIB1 is also involved in the regulation of immune cell differentiation, particularly promoting eosinophil differentiation over neutrophil differentiation by regulating C/EBPα degradation (Danger2022The).

TRIB1 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences transcriptional activity and protein degradation. It interacts with E3 ubiquitin ligases, facilitating the degradation of transcription factors, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating intracellular signaling networks (Danger2022The). In the liver, TRIB1 regulates lipid metabolism by influencing the expression of lipogenic enzymes and affecting plasma lipid levels, including triglycerides and cholesterol (Iwamoto2015The; Burkhardt2010Trib1). It also interacts with hepatocyte nuclear factor 4-alpha (HNF4A), maintaining its stability and function, which is crucial for liver and intestinal gene regulation (Soubeyrand2017TRIB1).

## Clinical Significance
The TRIB1 gene is implicated in various cancers and immune-mediated diseases due to its role in cell signaling and regulation. In cancer, TRIB1 is associated with multiple types, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), breast cancer, prostate cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In AML, TRIB1 overexpression is linked to increased MEK1/ERK activity, promoting cell self-renewal and leukemogenesis by facilitating the degradation of C/EBPα through interaction with the E3 ubiquitin ligase COP1 (McMillan2021Structure). In breast cancer, TRIB1 amplification correlates with decreased survival rates and is involved in cell cycle regulation by modulating CCND1 expression (McMillan2021Structure; Gendelman2017Bayesian). TRIB1 also contributes to prostate cancer pathogenesis, often co-amplified with the cMYC oncogene, and is involved in transcriptional regulation by cMYC (Shahrouzi2020Genomic).

Beyond cancer, TRIB1 is linked to immune-mediated diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, inflammatory bowel disease, and eczema. It plays a role in macrophage polarization, influencing the balance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory macrophages, which is crucial for immune response and inflammation (Danger2022The). TRIB1's involvement in these pathways highlights its potential as a therapeutic target in both oncological and immune-related conditions.

## Interactions
TRIB1, a member of the tribbles pseudokinase family, engages in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its regulatory functions. It interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase COP1, a common interactor for all human Tribbles proteins, which influences TRIB1's function by leading to a higher presence of proteasomal regulatory proteins (HernándezQuiles2021Comprehensive). TRIB1 also binds to C/EBP family transcription factors, such as C/EBPα, β, δ, and ε, with its interaction being modulated by the phosphorylation state of C/EBPβ. Phosphorylation at specific sites on C/EBPβ can lead to a loss of TRIB1 binding, suggesting a mechanism for stabilizing C/EBPβ and protecting it from degradation (Jamieson2018Substrate; Murphy2015Molecular).

TRIB1's interaction with C/EBPα involves conformational changes that relieve its autoinhibition, facilitating the recruitment of COP1 for ubiquitination processes (Jamieson2018Substrate). Additionally, TRIB1 forms complexes with mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MAPKKs), such as MEK1, MKK6, MKK4, and MKK7, which are primarily located in the nucleus, indicating its role as a regulator of MAPKK activity (Guan2016Competition). These interactions highlight TRIB1's role as an adapter protein in various cellular processes.
