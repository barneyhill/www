# NOMO3

## Overview
NOMO3, or Nodal Modulator 3, is a gene that encodes the protein NODAL modulator 3, which is involved in the regulation of NODAL signaling pathways. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein and plays a crucial role in embryonic development by modulating the activity of NODAL, a member of the TGF-beta superfamily of proteins. NODAL signaling is essential for processes such as mesoderm formation and left-right axis patterning during embryogenesis. The precise function and mechanisms of NOMO3 in these pathways are still under investigation, but its involvement suggests a significant role in developmental biology and potential implications in congenital disorders (Qiu2020aarFDC).
