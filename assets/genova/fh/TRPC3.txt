# TRPC3

## Overview
The TRPC3 gene encodes the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily C member 3, a protein that functions as a non-selective cation channel within the transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily. This protein is integral to various physiological processes, primarily through its role in calcium signaling. TRPC3 is characterized by its tetrameric structure, comprising six transmembrane segments that form a central ion-conducting pore. It is activated by diacylglycerol (DAG) and is involved in numerous cellular functions, including neuronal excitability, muscle contraction, and immune responses. The TRPC3 protein is notably expressed in the brain, particularly in cerebellar Purkinje cells, and plays a critical role in motor coordination and memory processes. Additionally, it is implicated in cardiovascular and immune system functions, where it influences calcium entry and downstream signaling pathways. Dysregulation of TRPC3 is associated with various diseases, including spinocerebellar ataxia and cardiovascular disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Cole2023Modulation; Tiapko2018TRPC3; Graziani2006Cellular).

## Structure
The TRPC3 protein is a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily and functions as a non-selective cation channel. It is composed of 848 amino acids and is encoded by the TRPC3 gene located on chromosome 4, consisting of 11 exons (Eder2024TRPC3:). The protein structure includes four ankyrin domains at the N-terminus, a coiled-coil domain, and a hydrophobic domain preceding the first transmembrane segment. The transmembrane core domain consists of six helical stretches (TM1-TM6), with TM5, TM6, and the connecting pore loop forming the central cation-conducting pore (Eder2024TRPC3:).

TRPC3 forms a tetrameric structure, with each subunit containing six transmembrane α helices. The first four helices (S1-S4) form a voltage sensor-like domain, while the last two (S5-S6) form the ion-conducting pore (Wang2020TRPC). The protein also features a pre-S1 elbow and pre-S1 helix embedded in the membrane, which connect to ankyrin-like repeats that stabilize the tetrameric structure (Wang2020TRPC). The TRPC3 protein has several splice variants, including a short variant (736 amino acids) and an extended variant (921 amino acids) (Eder2024TRPC3:). A putative glycosylation site is located in the first extracellular loop, which may influence channel activity (Fan2018Structure).

## Function
TRPC3 is a non-selective cation channel that plays a significant role in calcium signaling in healthy human cells. It is primarily activated by diacylglycerol (DAG) following G-protein-coupled receptor activation, which leads to calcium influx crucial for various cellular functions (Cole2023Modulation; Tiapko2018TRPC3). TRPC3 is highly expressed in the brain, particularly in cerebellar Purkinje cells, where it contributes to motor coordination and memory processes by mediating postsynaptic inward currents (Cole2023Modulation; Curcic2019TRPCmediated).

In the cardiovascular system, TRPC3 is involved in calcium entry and downstream signaling pathways, influencing vasodilatory responses and vascular remodeling (Tiapko2018TRPC3). It also plays a role in the immune system by facilitating calcium signaling in response to antigen stimulation (Tiapko2018TRPC3). TRPC3 channels are sensitive to membrane lipids, such as cholesterol, which regulate their activity and surface expression, highlighting their role in cellular cholesterol sensing and membrane conductance (Graziani2006Cellular).

Overall, TRPC3 channels are integral to maintaining calcium homeostasis and are involved in various physiological processes, including neuronal excitability, muscle contraction, and immune responses (Cole2023Modulation; Curcic2019TRPCmediated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and dysregulation of the TRPC3 gene are linked to several diseases and conditions. In the cerebellum, TRPC3 dysfunction is associated with cerebellar diseases such as spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA). Gain-of-function mutations in TRPC3 can cause SCA, as observed in SCA41 and the Moonwalker (Mwk) mouse model, which exhibit ataxic gait and Purkinje cell dysfunction (Cole2023Modulation; Becker2009A). The mGluR1-TRPC3 signaling pathway is dysregulated in multiple SCA subtypes, including SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA5, SCA14, SCA23, and SCA28 (Cole2023Modulation).

TRPC3 is also implicated in cardiovascular diseases, where its activity is associated with cardiac hypertrophy, arrhythmias, and hypertension. TRPC3 knockout mice show protection from pathologic cardiac hypertrophy, and TRPC3/6 antagonists can block pathological hypertrophic signaling (Chen2020Transient). In the context of atherosclerosis, TRPC3 expression in bone marrow is linked to the necrotic core of atherosclerotic plaques (Chen2020Transient).

In the central nervous system, TRPC3 is involved in epileptogenesis, with its inhibition reducing seizures in mice (Cole2023Modulation). TRPC3 also plays a role in cancer cell proliferation, although targeting it for cancer therapy has not been pursued (Cole2023Modulation).

## Interactions
TRPC3 interacts with a variety of proteins, forming complexes that are crucial for its function in calcium signaling. One significant interaction is with phospholipase Cγ1 (PLC-γ1), where TRPC3 binds to a partial pleckstrin homology (PH) domain in PLC-γ1. This interaction is essential for the lipid binding and cell-surface expression of TRPC3, influencing its channel activity (van2005Phospholipase).

In cardiac cells, TRPC3 forms a signaling complex with the sodium-calcium exchanger 1 (NCX1). This interaction is important for cardiac contractility and arrhythmogenesis, as TRPC3 activation affects NCX1 function, potentially through micro/nanodomain organization (Doleschal2015TRPC3; EDER2007Phospholipase).

Proteomic analyses have identified numerous TRPC3-interacting proteins, including those involved in calcium signaling, vesicle trafficking, and endocytosis. Notable proteins include IP3 receptors, clathrin, and the 14-3-3 protein family, which may regulate TRPC3 phosphorylation. These interactions suggest that TRPC3 is part of a larger multiprotein complex that influences calcium signaling pathways (Lockwich2008Analysis).
