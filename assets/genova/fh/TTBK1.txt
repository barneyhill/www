# TTBK1

## Overview
Tau tubulin kinase 1 (TTBK1) is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase protein, which is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system. The TTBK1 protein is involved in the phosphorylation of tau and tubulin, playing a critical role in microtubule dynamics and stability. As a member of the casein kinase 1 (CK1) superfamily, TTBK1 is distinct from the CK1 family but shares structural features such as an activation loop that may facilitate substrate interaction (Sato2006Tau‐tubulin; Nozal2019Tau). The kinase is implicated in several physiological processes, including mitosis, ciliogenesis, and neurotransmission, and is particularly active in neurons of the cortical, hippocampal, and entorhinal cortex regions (Bao2020Mechanisms; Potjewyd2022Modulation). TTBK1's role in phosphorylating tau is of significant interest due to its association with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, where it contributes to tau pathology by reducing tau's affinity for microtubules and affecting their stability (Bao2020Mechanisms; Dillon2020Acute).

## Structure
The TTBK1 protein is composed of 1321 amino acids and includes a kinase domain and a unique polyglutamate domain in the middle region of its sequence (Sato2006Tau‐tubulin; Nozal2019Tau). The kinase domain is located at the N-terminal, comprising the first 297 amino acids, and is essential for its enzymatic activity (Taylor2019Tau; Nozal2019Tau). The polyglutamate domain, which spans residues 733-771, contributes to the protein's unique structural features and is responsible for its migration behavior in electrophoresis, where it appears larger than its predicted molecular weight due to the negative charges in this region (Nozal2019Tau).

TTBK1 belongs to the casein kinase 1 (CK1) superfamily and is closely related to CK1δ, although it is not a member of the CK1 family (Sato2006Tau‐tubulin; Nozal2019Tau). The protein's structure includes an activation loop typical of CK1 superfamily kinases, which may bind to pre-phosphorylated sites in substrates, potentially acting as an activation mechanism (Nozal2019Tau). TTBK1 is primarily expressed in the central nervous system and is involved in the phosphorylation of tau protein, a process linked to neurodegenerative diseases (Taylor2019Tau; Nozal2019Tau).

## Function
Tau tubulin kinase 1 (TTBK1) is a serine/threonine kinase primarily expressed in neurons of the central nervous system. It plays a significant role in phosphorylating tau and tubulin proteins, which are crucial for microtubule dynamics and stability. TTBK1 is involved in several key physiological processes, including mitosis, ciliogenesis, and neurotransmission (Potjewyd2022Modulation). In healthy cells, TTBK1 functions as a microtubule plus-end tracking protein (+TIP), interacting with end-binding proteins through SxIP motifs in its C-terminal tail, which is essential for its role in cytoskeleton dynamics (Bao2020Mechanisms).

TTBK1 is active in the cytoplasm, particularly in the cortical, hippocampal, and entorhinal cortex neurons, where it contributes to cellular processes such as glucose and GABA transport and neuroinflammation (Potjewyd2022Modulation). The kinase activity of TTBK1 is regulated by autophosphorylation, which affects its ability to phosphorylate tau, a key substrate involved in maintaining neuronal function and structure (Bao2020Mechanisms). TTBK1's phosphorylation of tau reduces its affinity for microtubules, impacting tubulin polymerization and microtubule stability, which are vital for normal cellular function (Dillon2020Acute).

## Interactions
Tau tubulin kinase 1 (TTBK1) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). TTBK1 phosphorylates tau protein at specific sites, including S422, which is associated with neurofibrillary tangle formation in AD (Bao2020Mechanisms; Dillon2020Acute). This phosphorylation reduces tau's affinity for microtubules, affecting microtubule assembly and stability (Dillon2020Acute).

TTBK1 also interacts with collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP2), phosphorylating it in a manner that contributes to neurite degeneration and the accumulation of phosphorylated tau in neurons (Ikezu2020Tautubulin). This interaction is particularly significant in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampal regions, which are affected in early stages of AD (Ikezu2020Tautubulin).

In addition to its direct interactions, TTBK1 may activate other kinases such as CDK5, further contributing to tau phosphorylation (Dillon2020Acute). The kinase's role in phosphorylating tau and other proteins highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for modulating tau pathology in AD and related tauopathies (Halkina2021Discovery).
