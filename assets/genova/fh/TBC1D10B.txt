# TBC1D10B

## Overview
TBC1D10B is a gene that encodes the protein TBC1 domain family member 10B, which functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP). This protein is involved in the regulation of intracellular trafficking by modulating the activity of Rab GTPases, particularly Rab35, and plays a significant role in processes such as endocytosis, exosome secretion, and phagocytosis (Lin2021BAG3; Hsu2010Regulation; Egami2024Rit1TBC1D10B). TBC1D10B is also implicated in the regulation of angiogenesis through its effects on VEGFR2 signaling pathways (Xie2019Regulation). The gene's expression and function have been associated with various clinical conditions, including cancer and neurological disorders, highlighting its importance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Vysotskiy2021Integration; Barbirou2022Evaluation).

## Function
TBC1D10B, also known as EPI64B, is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that plays a crucial role in regulating intracellular trafficking by modulating the activity of Rab GTPases, particularly Rab35. In healthy human cells, TBC1D10B is involved in endosomal trafficking, where it inactivates Rab35 by promoting GTP hydrolysis, thus influencing processes such as endocytosis and exosome secretion (Lin2021BAG3; Hsu2010Regulation). The interaction between TBC1D10B and BAG3 is essential for maintaining Rab35 in its active form, which is important for endosomal sorting and tau clearance, processes critical for cellular transport pathways and neuronal health (Lin2021BAG3).

TBC1D10B is also implicated in the regulation of phagocytosis in macrophages, where it negatively regulates phagosome formation through both Rab-GAP activity-dependent and independent mechanisms (Egami2024Rit1TBC1D10B). Additionally, TBC1D10B affects VEGFR2 signaling in endothelial cells, where its expression leads to reduced phosphorylation of signaling proteins and impaired angiogenesis, indicating a negative regulatory role in these processes (Xie2019Regulation). These functions highlight TBC1D10B's involvement in various cellular processes, including membrane trafficking and signal transduction.

## Clinical Significance
TBC1D10B has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in intracellular trafficking and membrane dynamics. Alterations in TBC1D10B expression or function have been associated with cancer and neurological disorders. In the context of cancer, TBC1D10B has been identified in studies exploring cell-free DNA (cfDNA) as a biomarker for early cancer detection. Specifically, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TBC1D10B were found in subjects with dense breast tissue and positive mammograms, suggesting its potential involvement in non-breast cancer-related pathways (Barbirou2022Evaluation).

In neurological disorders, TBC1D10B has been linked to psychosis. A study integrating genetic, transcriptomic, and clinical data found that TBC1D10B, located at the 16p11.2 chromosomal region, likely has an independent association with psychosis, indicating its potential clinical significance in this context (Vysotskiy2021Integration).

Additionally, TBC1D10B plays a role in angiogenesis by regulating VEGFR2 signaling. It negatively affects VEGFR2-mediated pathways, which could be relevant to conditions involving abnormal vascular growth (Xie2019Regulation). These findings highlight the diverse clinical implications of TBC1D10B in disease contexts.

## Interactions
TBC1D10B is known to interact with several proteins, primarily through its role as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP). It has been shown to colocalize with Rit1, a GTPase, at the phagosomal membrane during FcγR-mediated phagocytosis in RAW264 macrophages. This interaction is crucial for regulating phagosome formation, with Rit1 facilitating the dissociation of TBC1D10B from phagocytic cups, a process essential for phagosome formation (Egami2024Rit1TBC1D10B).

TBC1D10B also interacts with Rab35, a small GTPase involved in exosome secretion. It acts as a GAP for Rab35, influencing exosome release by accelerating GTP hydrolysis, which reduces exosome secretion (Hsu2010Regulation). However, in the context of Weibel-Palade body exocytosis, TBC1D10B's interaction with Rab35 is less clear, as it does not seem to regulate Rab35 in the same manner as TBC1D10A, another member of the TBC1D10 family (Biesemann2017Rab35).

In cancer biology, TBC1D10B is implicated in the modulation of miR-3619-5p, a microRNA, in stomach adenocarcinoma, suggesting a regulatory interaction that influences cancer progression (Liu2020STAT4mediated).
