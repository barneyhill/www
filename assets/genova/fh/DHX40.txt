# DHX40

## Overview
DHX40 is a gene that encodes the DEAH-box helicase 40, a member of the DEAH-box family of RNA helicases. These helicases are crucial for RNA metabolism, as they facilitate the unwinding of RNA structures and the remodeling of ribonucleoprotein complexes. The protein encoded by DHX40 is involved in maintaining RNA homeostasis and proper gene expression, functioning in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Abdelhaleem2003The). While the specific roles of DHX40 in healthy human cells are not fully elucidated, it is implicated in the regulation of RNA helicase complexes and may be involved in proteasomal degradation pathways (Owens2023A). Additionally, DHX40 has been associated with various cancers, including colorectal and hematological malignancies, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Olkinuora2023Identification).

## Function
DHX40 (DEAH-box helicase 40) is a member of the DEAH-box family of RNA helicases, which are involved in various aspects of RNA metabolism. These helicases function by unwinding RNA structures, facilitating the remodeling of ribonucleoprotein complexes. DHX40 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, playing a crucial role in maintaining RNA homeostasis and proper gene expression (Abdelhaleem2003The).

In healthy human cells, DHX40 is implicated in the regulation of RNA helicase complexes. It is suggested that DHX40 might be part of complexes containing multiple RNA helicases, which facilitate multivalent interactions. This implies that DHX40's function could be related to its role in these complexes and its regulation by GID4-mediated proteasomal degradation (Owens2023A). The regulation of DHX40 by GID4 suggests that it may be involved in the proteasomal degradation pathway, although DHX40 did not appear to directly interact with GID4 in proximity-dependent biotinylation experiments, indicating that its regulation might occur through indirect interactions mediated by intermediary proteins such as RNA helicases (Owens2023A).

Despite its involvement in these processes, the specific function of DHX40 in healthy human cells remains not fully determined, as noted in earlier studies (Abdelhaleem2003The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DHX40 gene have been implicated in various cancers, particularly colorectal and hematological malignancies. A study identified DHX40 as a candidate susceptibility gene for colorectal cancer, especially in familial colorectal cancer type X (FCCTX), which is characterized by the absence of DNA mismatch repair defects. A heterozygous truncating variant in DHX40 was found in a family with both myelodysplastic syndrome/acute leukemia and colorectal cancer. This variant is predicted to result in the deletion of the helicase domain, suggesting that the loss of function of the mutant allele could be sufficient for tumorigenesis, indicating haploinsufficiency (Olkinuora2023Identification).

In addition to colorectal cancer, DHX40 has been associated with hematological neoplasia. RNA-sequencing of DHX40-siRNA-treated cells revealed a significant increase in novel splice events, particularly exon skipping, which may contribute to cancer development. Although no germline variants suspected to be pathogenic were found in DHX40 in the studied families, a nonsense variant was identified in a patient with multiple myeloma, suggesting a potential role in myeloid disorders (Olkinuora2023Identification). The study highlights the broader involvement of the DDX/DHX gene family in hematological malignancies, drawing parallels between DHX40 and other RNA helicase genes like DDX41.

## Interactions
DHX40, a member of the DEAH-box family of RNA helicases, engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in RNA metabolism and genome stability. It interacts with USP7, a deubiquitinase that stabilizes DHX40 by preventing its proteasomal degradation. This interaction is crucial for maintaining DHX40 levels within the cell (1 page 20 of 34). DHX40 also interacts with TRIM27, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, in an avidity-dependent manner. This interaction is influenced by the N-terminal region of DHX40, which contains potential ubiquitination sites (1 page 30 of 34).

PPIL4, a putative prolyl isomerase, is another significant interactor of DHX40. PPIL4 stimulates DHX40's ATPase activity and may recruit DHX40 to its RNA substrates, suggesting a functional interaction in RNA metabolism (1 page 31 of 34). DHX40 also forms interactions with proteins involved in LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposition, such as XRCC5, XRCC6, and HNRNPM, indicating a role in regulating L1 activity and genome stability (1 page 24 of 34).

In terms of nucleic acid interactions, DHX40 primarily binds to intronic regions of protein-coding RNAs, lncRNAs, and pseudogenes, suggesting involvement in pre-mRNA splicing and regulation of transposable elements (1 page 24 of 34).
