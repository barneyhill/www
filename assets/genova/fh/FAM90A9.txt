# FAM90A9

## Overview
FAM90A9 is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 90, member A9. This gene is part of a larger family of genes that are characterized by their conserved sequences, which suggest a shared evolutionary origin and potential functional similarities. The protein encoded by FAM90A9 is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific biological role remains to be fully elucidated. It is not categorized as a kinase, receptor, or transmembrane protein, but rather as a member of a family with sequence similarity, indicating that it may have unique or specialized functions within the cell. Research into FAM90A9 and its protein product is ongoing, with studies aiming to uncover its interactions and potential implications in health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
