# SPEN

## Overview
The SPEN gene encodes the spen family transcriptional repressor, a large multidomain protein that plays a critical role in transcriptional regulation. This protein is characterized by its RNA-binding capabilities, facilitated by four RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains, and its interaction with other proteins through a highly conserved SPOC (Spen paralog and ortholog C-terminal) domain. As a transcriptional repressor, the SPEN protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of X chromosome inactivation and the maintenance of nucleolar structure. It interacts with several complexes, such as the MBD3-NuRD complex, to mediate gene silencing and chromatin organization. Clinically, alterations in SPEN expression and mutations have been linked to diseases such as breast cancer, neurodevelopmental disorders, and colorectal cancer, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease pathogenesis (Radio2021SPEN; Robert-Finestra2021SPEN; Button2023Dissection; Korfanty2018SPEN).

## Structure
The SPEN protein is a large multidomain RNA-binding protein involved in transcriptional repression. It contains four RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains at the N-terminus and a highly conserved SPOC (Spen paralog and ortholog C-terminal) domain at the C-terminus (Button2023Dissection; Korfanty2018SPEN). The RRMs facilitate RNA binding, with RRM 1-4 showing strong affinity for SRA and XIST A-repeat RNA (Button2023Dissection). RRM 3 is crucial for SRA RNA binding, while RRM 4 is essential for binding to both SRA and XIST RNA (Button2023Dissection).

The SPOC domain is a compact structure, approximately 40 × 40 × 45 Å, consisting of a β-barrel with seven strands and six α-helices. It features a nonuniform charge distribution, with a basic patch crucial for protein-protein interactions, particularly with the SMRT/NCoR corepressors (Ariyoshi2003A). The SPOC domain's structure includes deep grooves and clefts, suited for these interactions (Ariyoshi2003A).

SPEN is subject to post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and may have splice variant isoforms, contributing to its functional diversity (Korfanty2018SPEN). The protein is predominantly nuclear and plays a role in organizing transcription factors and regulating gene expression (Korfanty2018SPEN).

## Function
The SPEN gene, also known as SHARP in humans, encodes a transcriptional repressor protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes. In endothelial cells, SPEN is crucial for maintaining nucleolar structure and function, which is essential for ribosomal biogenesis. Knockdown of SPEN in these cells leads to nucleolar stress and activation of the p53 pathway, affecting cell cycle regulation and DNA repair (Yang2023Repression). SPEN is also involved in the regulation of X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in female placental mammals. It facilitates the upregulation of the long noncoding RNA Xist, which is necessary for silencing one of the X chromosomes, by silencing its antisense transcript Tsix (Robert-Finestra2021SPEN). SPEN binds to the Xist repeat A region and recruits corepressors to modify chromatin, promoting gene silencing (Robert-Finestra2021SPEN).

In the context of cancer, SPEN expression is elevated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, where it promotes pathogenesis by activating signaling pathways that enhance cell migration and invasion (Li2020SPEN). These diverse roles highlight SPEN's importance in transcriptional regulation, cell cycle control, and maintaining genomic stability.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the SPEN gene have been implicated in various diseases, including breast cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders. In breast cancer, SPEN plays a significant role in primary ciliogenesis and cell migration. High SPEN expression is associated with early metastasis in hormone receptor-negative breast cancer patients, suggesting its potential as a predictive biomarker for metastasis risk (Légaré2017SPEN). SPEN's involvement in primary cilia formation and cell migration indicates a cilia-dependent mechanism in cancer progression (Légaré2017SPEN).

SPEN haploinsufficiency is linked to a neurodevelopmental disorder that overlaps with proximal 1p36 deletion syndrome. This condition is characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral abnormalities, and congenital anomalies, particularly affecting the brain and heart (Radio2021SPEN). The disorder is associated with a distinctive X chromosome episignature in females, which could serve as a diagnostic tool (Radio2021SPEN).

In colorectal cancer, SPEN mutations are associated with increased efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors, suggesting their potential as predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy response (Dong2024The). These mutations correlate with higher tumor mutational burden and increased presence of activated immune cells, enhancing the inflammatory tumor microenvironment.

## Interactions
SPEN, a transcriptional repressor, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in gene regulation. It is known to interact with the MBD3-NuRD complex, which is involved in gene-silencing pathways such as nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylation. This interaction is crucial for processes like X chromosome inactivation (XCI), where SPEN helps recruit the NuRD complex to active enhancers through MBD3's recognition of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (Chu2015Systematic).

SPEN also binds to the long noncoding RNA Xist, particularly the A-repeat region, which is essential for XCI. This binding is mediated by SPEN's RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), specifically RRM2-4, which recognize structural features in RNA, such as single-stranded bulges adjacent to double-stranded regions (Carter2019Spen; Button2023Dissection). The RRM3 domain is particularly important for this interaction, as mutations in this domain reduce binding affinity (Carter2019Spen).

In mouse testicular cells, SPEN interacts with chromatin and is associated with the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylating (NuRD) complex, particularly through its interaction with MTA1, a component of this complex (Korfanty2018SPEN). These interactions highlight SPEN's role in transcriptional repression and chromatin organization.
