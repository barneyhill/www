# RNF182

## Overview
RNF182 is a gene located on chromosome 6 that encodes the protein ring finger protein 182, a transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is characterized by a C3HC4-type RING finger domain, which is essential for its role in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, facilitating the degradation of target proteins such as ATP6V0C (Liu2008A). RNF182 is predominantly expressed in the brain, with notable presence in regions like the cortex and hippocampus, and is implicated in neurodegenerative processes, particularly Alzheimer's disease, where its expression is upregulated (Liu2008A). The protein's interactions with ATP6V0C and the p65 subunit of NF-κB highlight its involvement in both neuronal function and immune response regulation, underscoring its multifaceted role in cellular homeostasis and disease pathogenesis (Cao2019The; Liu2008A).

## Structure
RNF182 is a transmembrane protein encoded by a gene on chromosome 6, producing two alternatively spliced transcripts that encode the same protein of 247 amino acids with a molecular mass of 27.4 kDa (Liu2008A). The protein features a C3HC4-type RING finger domain located between amino acids C20 and C67, which is crucial for its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Liu2008A). This domain facilitates the degradation of target proteins, such as ATP6V0C, by mediating protein-protein interactions (Liu2008A).

RNF182 also contains two transmembrane helices at the C-terminus, spanning amino acids 178-200 and 212-234, which may enable its interaction with membrane-associated proteins like ATP6V0C (Liu2008A). Additionally, the protein includes four leucine repeats between amino acids 197 and 225, which are often involved in protein-protein interactions (Liu2008A).

The protein is localized in the cytoplasm and is brain-enriched, with expression detected in regions such as the cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and spinal cord (Liu2008A). RNF182 is upregulated in Alzheimer's disease brains, suggesting a role in neurodegenerative processes (Liu2008A).

## Function
RNF182 is a brain-enriched E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a role in the degradation of proteins via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. It is involved in the regulation of protein turnover, particularly in the context of neurotransmitter release machinery. RNF182 interacts with ATP6V0C, a subunit of the lysosomal ATPase, facilitating its degradation. This interaction is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating the levels of ATP6V0C, which is involved in neurotransmitter release (Liu2008A).

In healthy human cells, RNF182 is expressed at low levels, predominantly in differentiated neurons and astrocytes. Its expression is upregulated under stress conditions, such as oxygen-glucose deprivation, suggesting a role in stress response or neuroprotection (Liu2008A). RNF182's activity is linked to its RING finger domain, which is characteristic of ubiquitin E3 ligases that facilitate the degradation of unwanted proteins to prevent neuronal cell death (Liu2008A).

The protein is localized in the cytoplasm and is involved in the degradation of membrane proteins at nerve terminals, potentially influencing neuronal function and survival (Liu2008A).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RNF182 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), RNF182 is significantly upregulated in the brain, where it is associated with increased cell death under stress conditions such as oxygen-glucose deprivation and exposure to β-amyloid peptide. This upregulation is linked to the degradation of ATP6V0C, a component involved in neurotransmitter release, suggesting a role in the neurodegenerative processes characteristic of AD (Liu2008A).

In the context of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), RNF182 expression is notably decreased, often due to hypermethylation of its promoter region. This downregulation is associated with increased tumor progression and poor clinical outcomes, particularly in lung adenocarcinoma. The suppression of RNF182 in NSCLC is mediated by environmental carcinogens like benzo[a]pyrene, which promote its hypermethylation and subsequent silencing, suggesting that RNF182 may function as a tumor suppressor in this context (Liu2023Inhibition).

RNF182 also plays a role in immune regulation by inhibiting TLR-induced NF-kB activation, which is crucial for controlling inflammation. Dysregulation of RNF182 could potentially contribute to inflammatory disorders due to its impact on cytokine production (Cao2019The).

## Interactions
RNF182 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. One of its primary interactions is with ATP6V0C, a subunit of the lysosomal ATPase complex involved in neurotransmitter release and gap junction formation. RNF182 binds to ATP6V0C through its C-terminal domain, facilitating the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of ATP6V0C. This interaction is significant in the context of Alzheimer's disease, where RNF182 is upregulated and contributes to neuronal cell death by degrading ATP6V0C (Liu2008A).

RNF182 also interacts with the p65 subunit of NF-κB, a key component in the TLR signaling pathway. It promotes the K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation of p65, thereby inhibiting NF-κB activation and reducing the production of proinflammatory cytokines. This interaction highlights RNF182's role as a negative regulator of TLR-induced inflammation, maintaining immune homeostasis (Cao2019The; Cai2022The).

These interactions underscore RNF182's involvement in both neurodegenerative diseases and immune response regulation, illustrating its multifaceted role in cellular homeostasis and disease pathogenesis.
