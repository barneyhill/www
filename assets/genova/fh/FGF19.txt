# FGF19

## Overview
Fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) is a gene that encodes the protein fibroblast growth factor 19, a member of the fibroblast growth factor family. This protein functions primarily as an endocrine hormone and is involved in the regulation of bile acid, lipid, and glucose metabolism. Unlike other fibroblast growth factors, FGF19 has a unique heparin-binding site topology, which contributes to its distinct functional properties. The protein interacts with fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) and the co-receptor β-Klotho to mediate its effects, particularly in the liver, where it plays a critical role in metabolic homeostasis. FGF19 is also implicated in various pathological conditions, including hepatocellular carcinoma and metabolic disorders, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Goetz2007Molecular; Degirolamo2015Therapeutic; Zhou2017Noncellautonomous).

## Structure
The molecular structure of the fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) protein is distinct from other fibroblast growth factors due to its unique heparin-binding site (HBS) topology. FGF19 lacks the typical heparin-binding affinity seen in paracrine FGFs, attributed to a unique conformation in the heparin-binding region between β strands 10 and 12, where a helical structure (α11) replaces the canonical β11 strand (Goetz2007Molecular). This results in an atypical trefoil appearance and a cleft between the β1-β2 loop and the β10-β12 region, which is not present in paracrine FGFs (Goetz2007Molecular).

The FGF19 protein structure is characterized by a core homology domain that folds into a globular domain composed of 12 antiparallel β-strands, known as the β-trefoil motif, although the region between β10 and β12 is missing, resulting in only 11 β strands (Goetz2007Molecular). A disulfide bridge between cysteines 58 and 70 stabilizes this altered conformation (Goetz2007Molecular). The FGF19 subfamily, including FGF19, is the most divergent among FGFs, with FGF19 sharing the highest sequence identity with FGF21 and FGF23 (Goetz2007Molecular). The protein's structure and function are dependent on the presence of Klotho/βKlotho proteins in target tissues (Goetz2007Molecular).

## Function
FGF19 is a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating bile acid, lipid, and glucose metabolism in healthy human cells. It is primarily expressed in the small intestine and acts as an endocrine hormone, influencing various physiological processes. FGF19 functions by binding to the FGFR4 receptor and its co-receptor β-klotho, forming a complex that triggers signaling cascades involving cytosolic adaptors like FRS2α. This interaction is essential for its metabolic actions, particularly in the liver (Kir2011Roles; Degirolamo2015Therapeutic).

In the liver, FGF19 inhibits cholesterol-7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), the enzyme responsible for the first step in bile acid synthesis, thereby regulating bile acid levels. It also suppresses triglyceride and glucose synthesis by inhibiting sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1C (SREBP1C) and cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB), respectively. FGF19 promotes glycogen synthesis and fatty acid oxidation by inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2 (ACC2) (Kir2011Roles; Degirolamo2015Therapeutic).

FGF19's role extends to energy homeostasis, where it enhances hepatic fatty acid oxidation and protects against diet-induced obesity. It also influences gallbladder function by promoting gallbladder filling and opposing the action of cholecystokinin (CCK) (Kir2011Roles; FUKUMOTO2008Actions).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FGF19 gene are implicated in several diseases, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). FGF19 is frequently amplified in HCC, and its overexpression is associated with tumor development and progression. It activates the STAT3 signaling pathway, which is crucial for its pro-tumorigenic activity, and higher FGF19 expression correlates with shorter overall survival in HCC patients (Zhou2017Noncellautonomous). FGF19 also regulates cyclin D1 protein levels through β-catenin signaling, promoting tumor growth in liver cancer (Sawey2011Identification).

In gallbladder carcinoma (GBC), FGF19 is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis. It promotes GBC progression by activating FGFR4 phosphorylation and downstream ERK signaling, enhancing cell proliferation and invasion (Chen2021FGF19). FGF19 is also implicated in other cancers, such as gastric, colon, and pancreatic cancers, where it influences cell migration, invasion, and tumor behavior (Somm2018Fibroblast).

In metabolic disorders, altered FGF19 levels are linked to conditions like type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, where its expression and response are impaired (Somm2018Fibroblast).

## Interactions
FGF19 interacts primarily with fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) and the co-receptor β-Klotho to form a signaling complex. This interaction is crucial for FGF19's role in regulating metabolic processes, particularly in the liver, where it influences bile acid, lipid, and glucose metabolism (Degirolamo2015Therapeutic). The FGFR4-β-Klotho complex mediates FGF19's effects by recruiting cytosolic adaptors such as fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2α (FRS2α) and growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2), triggering downstream signaling cascades (Degirolamo2015Therapeutic).

FGF19 also interacts with heparin, although its heparin-binding affinity is weaker compared to other FGFs. This reduced affinity allows FGF19 to function as an endocrine hormone, circulating in the bloodstream and acting at distant sites (Goetz2007Molecular; Wu2010Separating). The β1-β2 loop and β10-β12 regions of FGF19 are important for its interaction with heparin, which influences FGFR4 activation (Wu2010Separating).

In addition to its interactions with proteins, FGF19's expression is regulated by nuclear receptors, including the vitamin D receptor (VDR), vitamin A receptor (RXR), and pregnane X receptor (PXR), through bile acid-mediated transcriptional activation (Degirolamo2015Therapeutic).
