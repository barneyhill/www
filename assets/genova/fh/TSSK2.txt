# TSSK2

## Overview
TSSK2, or testis-specific serine kinase 2, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the serine/threonine kinase family, which is characterized by its role in phosphorylating serine and threonine residues on substrate proteins. The TSSK2 protein is predominantly expressed in the testis and plays a crucial role in spermatogenesis, particularly during the post-meiotic stages of sperm development. It is involved in the phosphorylation of proteins essential for sperm maturation and function, including those necessary for flagellar movement and chromatoid body transformation. The protein's kinase activity is dependent on the presence of Mg2+ ions and is inactive with Mn2+. TSSK2's interactions with other proteins, such as the testis-specific kinase substrate (TSKS) and SPAG16L, underscore its importance in sperm motility and mitochondrial sheath development. Clinically, mutations in the TSSK2 gene are associated with male infertility, and the protein is being investigated as a potential target for non-hormonal male contraception (Zhang2023Broad; Salicioni2020Testis-specific).

## Structure
The TSSK2 protein, encoded by the TSSK2 gene, is a member of the serine/threonine kinase family, characterized by a conserved catalytic domain known as S_TKc (serine/threonine protein kinases, catalytic domain) (Li2021cDNA). This domain is located between positions 12 and 272 of the protein, which consists of 358 amino acids (Li2021cDNA). The primary structure of TSSK2 includes all 20 types of amino acids, contributing to its molecular weight of approximately 40.86 kDa and a theoretical isoelectric point of 9.19 (Li2021cDNA).

The tertiary structure of TSSK2 was predicted using the protein kinase c4wnkA as a template, achieving a coverage rate of 78% and a reliability of 100%, indicating a similar spatial structure to other proteins in the kinase family (Li2021cDNA). TSSK2 is a stable, hydrophilic protein, lacking trans-membrane regions and signal peptides, suggesting it functions within the cytoplasm rather than as a membrane receptor or secreted protein (Li2021cDNA).

TSSK2 undergoes post-translational modifications, with 26 predicted phosphorylation sites, including 17 serine, 6 threonine, and 3 tyrosine sites, which may regulate its activity (Li2021cDNA). These modifications are crucial for its role in spermatogenesis and sperm function.

## Function
TSSK2 (testis-specific serine kinase 2) is a protein kinase that plays a critical role in spermatogenesis, particularly during the post-meiotic stages of sperm development. It is primarily expressed in the testis and is involved in the phosphorylation of proteins essential for sperm maturation and function. TSSK2 is active in the cytoplasm and is localized in the sperm head postacrosomal region, which is rich in polymerized actin (Salicioni2020Testis-specific).

TSSK2 interacts with the testis-specific kinase substrate (TSKS) and is involved in the phosphorylation of SPAG16L, an axoneme protein necessary for flagellar movement, suggesting its role in sperm motility (Salicioni2020Testis-specific). The kinase activity of TSSK2 requires Mg2+ and is inactive in the presence of Mn2+ (Salicioni2020Testis-specific). TSSK2 also plays a role in the functional transformation of the chromatoid body, which is important for RNA storage and metabolism in male germ cells (Salicioni2020Testis-specific).

In knockout mouse models, the absence of TSSK2 leads to male infertility due to developmental dysregulation and mitochondrial sheath collapse in late spermatids, highlighting its essential role in spermatogenesis (Salicioni2020Testis-specific).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the TSSK2 gene are associated with male infertility, particularly conditions such as azoospermia and severe oligospermia. These conditions result from impaired spermatogenesis, which is crucial for sperm development and function (Zhang2023Broad; Salicioni2020Testis-specific). Single-nucleotide mutations in TSSK2 have been linked to these infertility issues, highlighting the gene's clinical significance in reproductive health (Zhang2023Broad).

In addition to its role in fertility, TSSK2 has been implicated in cancer biology. It is identified as a rate-limiting kinase that promotes cell proliferation and survival in certain cancer cell lines, such as HELA and RKO colorectal carcinoma cells. This suggests that TSSK2 may play a role in regulating tumor suppression pathways, particularly in the context of pRb tumor suppression activity (Salicioni2020Testis-specific).

The potential of TSSK2 as a target for non-hormonal male contraception is also being explored. Inhibiting TSSK2 could disrupt spermiogenesis, thereby impeding sperm production and offering a novel approach to male contraception (Zhang2023Broad; Salicioni2020Testis-specific).

## Interactions
TSSK2 (testis-specific serine kinase 2) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a crucial role in spermatogenesis. One of its primary interactions is with the Testis-specific kinase substrate (TSKS), a 65-kDa protein that TSSK2 can phosphorylate. This interaction was identified using yeast two-hybrid methodology and confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, showing that TSSK2 and TSKS colocalize in spermatid centrioles during flagellogenesis (Salicioni2020Testis-specific).

TSSK2 also interacts with SPAG16L, an axoneme protein essential for flagellar movement. The interaction occurs via the WD repeats in the C-terminal domain of SPAG16L, and TSSK2 phosphorylates SPAG16L in vitro. This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and colocalization studies in transfected cells (Zhang2008Phosphorylation).

Additionally, TSSK2 has been shown to phosphorylate the Myelin Basic Protein (MBP) peptide in vitro, indicating its broader kinase activity (Salicioni2020Testis-specific). TSSK2 may also interact with the testis-specific phosphatase isoform PPP1CC2, forming a complex with TSKS that is involved in sperm mitochondrial sheath development during spermatogenesis (Salicioni2020Testis-specific).
