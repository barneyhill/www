# LHPP

## Overview
The LHPP gene encodes the protein phospholysine phosphohistidine inorganic pyrophosphate phosphatase, which is a member of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of hydrolases. This protein functions primarily as a phosphatase, playing a critical role in dephosphorylating phospholysine and phosphohistidine residues, thereby regulating key cellular processes such as signal transduction and energy metabolism (Guo2022Does; Hou2021LHPP). The LHPP protein is characterized by its conserved catalytic core and is predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm, where it acts as a tumor suppressor by modulating pathways like PI3K/AKT and TGF-β/Smad, which are crucial for cell proliferation and metastasis (Guo2022Does; Liao2020LHPP). The gene is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, including the brain, kidney, and liver, underscoring its broad role in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Liao2020LHPP). Alterations in LHPP expression are associated with several cancers and other health conditions, highlighting its clinical significance (Guo2022Does; Feroz2023A).

## Structure
The LHPP protein, also known as phospholysine phosphohistidine inorganic pyrophosphate phosphatase, is a member of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of hydrolases. It is characterized by a conserved catalytic core and a large C2a-type cap domain typical of small metabolite-directed HAD hydrolases (Gohla2019Do). The protein forms a homodimer in solution, indicating its quaternary structure (Gohla2019Do). The human LHPP structure was resolved by X-ray crystallography to a resolution of 1.92 Å, revealing a unique motif I (14 VLLDISGVLY 23) where the Asp+2 residue is replaced by Ser+2, a feature that may distinguish phosphoramidases (Gohla2019Do).

The LHPP protein consists of 270 amino acids and weighs approximately 29 kDa. It contains three leucine zipper domains and is highly conserved across species (Feroz2023A). The protein is primarily expressed in the cytoplasm and is involved in dephosphorylation processes, functioning as a phosphohistidine phosphate inorganic pyrophosphatase (Guo2022Does). The LHPP gene produces nine splice variants, which may result in different protein isoforms with potentially distinct functions (Gohla2019Do). The protein is involved in regulating key signaling pathways, such as PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Wnt/catenin, which are crucial for controlling cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis, and metastasis (Feroz2023A).

## Function
The LHPP gene encodes a phosphatase enzyme that plays a crucial role in dephosphorylating phospholysine and phosphohistidine residues in proteins, which is essential for regulating cellular processes such as signal transduction and energy metabolism. This enzyme is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis and normal physiological functions (Guo2022Does; Hou2021LHPP).

In healthy human cells, LHPP is involved in regulating protein phosphorylation, a critical process for maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing uncontrolled cell growth and metastasis. It acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting pathways like PI3K/AKT and TGF-β/Smad, which are involved in cell proliferation and metastasis (Guo2022Does; Liao2020LHPP). The gene is ubiquitously expressed in tissues such as the brain, kidney, and liver, indicating its broad role in cellular regulation (Liao2020LHPP).

LHPP also plays a role in modulating the Wnt/catenin signaling pathway by lowering phospho-GSK-3 levels and depleting active catenin, which inactivates the pathway. This regulation is crucial for controlling cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cancer progression (Feroz2023A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the LHPP gene are associated with various cancers. The LHPP gene encodes a tumor suppressor protein, and its reduced expression is linked to poor prognosis in several cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma, glioblastoma, melanoma, and colorectal cancer (Guo2022Does). In colorectal cancer, low LHPP expression correlates with larger tumor size, advanced disease stage, and lymph node metastasis. Overexpression of LHPP suppresses cancer cell growth and proliferation, while knockdown has the opposite effect (Hou2019Tumor). 

In prostate cancer, decreased LHPP expression is associated with disease progression and poor clinical outcomes, including higher T and N stages and Gleason scores (Xie2024Phosphatase). In gastric cancer, LHPP expression is lower in cancer tissues compared to normal tissues, and its overexpression reduces proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells (Guo2022Does). 

The LHPP gene is also implicated in stress-related illnesses such as depression, with certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) potentially linked to depressive disorders, risky sexual behavior, and alcohol dependence (Feroz2023A). These findings highlight the clinical significance of LHPP in cancer progression and other health conditions.

## Interactions
The LHPP protein is involved in various interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. In prostate cancer, LHPP acts as a tumor suppressor by modulating the AKT-SKP2-ACSL4 pathway. It interacts with AKT, a serine-threonine kinase, inhibiting its phosphorylation, which affects the stability of ACSL4 by preventing its degradation through the ubiquitin-lysosome pathway (Xie2024Phosphatase). LHPP's interaction with AKT is crucial, as it influences the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of ACSL4, a key enzyme in lipid metabolism and ferroptosis (Xie2024Phosphatase).

LHPP also interacts with histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3), where its expression is regulated by acetylation and ubiquitination processes. Panobinostat, an HDAC inhibitor, enhances LHPP expression by inhibiting HDAC3, thereby stabilizing LHPP and affecting its interactions with the AKT pathway (Xie2024Phosphatase).

In colorectal cancer, LHPP is involved in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, where its overexpression leads to decreased phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT, suggesting an inhibitory interaction that affects cancer cell proliferation (Hou2019Tumor). These interactions highlight LHPP's role in modulating key signaling pathways involved in cancer progression.
