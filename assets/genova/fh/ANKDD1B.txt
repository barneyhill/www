# ANKDD1B

## Overview
ANKDD1B is a gene that encodes the protein ankyrin repeat and death domain containing 1B, which is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeats and a death domain. These structural motifs suggest that the protein may be involved in various cellular processes, including protein-protein interactions, cellular signaling, and immune responses. Ankyrin repeats are known for their role in facilitating interactions between proteins, while the death domain is associated with apoptotic signaling pathways and interactions with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors and Toll-like receptors, which are crucial for regulating inflammation and cell death (Tan2018Identification). The expression of ANKDD1B in diverse tissues, such as muscles and lymph nodes, as well as its presence in several cancer cell lines, indicates its potential involvement in a wide range of biological functions, particularly within the immune system (Tan2018Identification).

## Function
The ANKDD1B gene encodes a protein characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeats and a death domain, which are involved in various cellular processes. Ankyrin repeats are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the ANKDD1B protein may play a role in cellular signaling or structural organization (Tan2018Identification). These repeats are typically involved in processes such as inflammatory response, transcription, cell-cycle regulation, cytoskeleton integrity, development, cell-cell signaling, and protein transport (Tan2018Identification).

The death domain of the ANKDD1B protein is associated with regulating inflammation, innate immune response, and cell death through interactions with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors and Toll-like receptors (Tan2018Identification). This suggests a potential role in apoptotic signaling pathways, which are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and immune responses.

The expression of ANKDD1B is observed in various tissues, including muscles, lymph nodes, tonsils, and several cancer cell lines, indicating its involvement in diverse biological functions (Tan2018Identification). Although the specific functions of ANKDD1B in healthy human cells are not fully characterized, its domain structures and expression patterns suggest a significant role in the immune system and cellular signaling pathways.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ANKDD1B gene have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis (AS), a chronic inflammatory disease primarily affecting the spine and sacroiliac joints. The study by Tan et al. identified specific missense variants in ANKDD1B, such as p.L87V and p.R102L, which were associated with AS in a Chinese pedigree and a sporadic patient, respectively (Tan2018Identification). These variants were absent in a control group of 500 healthy individuals, suggesting a potential link between ANKDD1B mutations and AS (Tan2018Identification).

The ANKDD1B gene encodes a protein with ankyrin repeats and a death domain, structures involved in inflammatory responses and immune system functions. The L87V variant is predicted to have a deleterious effect on protein function, which may contribute to the development of AS (Tan2018Identification). The study also highlighted the complex oligogenic nature of AS, suggesting that ANKDD1B variants may play a role in AS pathogenesis, particularly in the presence of the HLA-B*27 allele, a known risk factor for AS (Tan2018Identification). Further research is needed to confirm these associations and understand the precise mechanisms by which ANKDD1B variants influence AS.
