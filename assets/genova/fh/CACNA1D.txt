# CACNA1D

## Overview
The CACNA1D gene encodes the calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1 D (Cav1.3), a pivotal component of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. These channels are integral membrane proteins that facilitate the influx of calcium ions into cells in response to membrane depolarization, playing crucial roles in various physiological processes such as muscle contraction, hormone secretion, and neuronal signaling. The Cav1.3 subunit is particularly significant in the cardiac, endocrine, and nervous systems, where it contributes to cardiac pacemaking, insulin release, and neuronal excitability, respectively (Ortner2020De; Zamponi2015The). The protein's structure includes four homologous domains, each with six transmembrane segments, and it undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms with distinct functional properties (Rinné2022Whole). Mutations in CACNA1D have been implicated in various clinical conditions, including neurodevelopmental disorders and primary hyperaldosteronism, highlighting its importance in human health (Rinné2022Whole; Hofer2020Biophysical).

## Structure
The CACNA1D gene encodes the Cav1.3 α1-subunit, a critical component of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. This protein is composed of four homologous domains (I-IV), each containing six transmembrane segments (S1-S6) and a pore region between the S5 and S6 helices (Rinné2022Whole). The structure includes specific motifs such as the EF, pre-IQ, and IQ motifs, which serve as interaction sites for calmodulin, a calcium-binding messenger protein (Rinné2022Whole).

The Cav1.3 channel undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms with distinct functional properties. Notably, the Cav1.3 L variant includes the alternatively spliced exon 8A, while the Cav1.3 S variant results from alternative splicing in exon 43, leading to a truncated C-terminal modulator (CTM) (Rinné2022Whole). These splice variants contribute to the channel's functional diversity and tissue-specific expression patterns.

The protein's quaternary structure involves its assembly with additional accessory subunits (α2δ, β, and γ), which modulate the channel's trafficking and gating properties (Rinné2022Whole). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and glycosylation, are common and play roles in regulating the channel's activity and stability (Hofer2020Stabilization).

## Function
The CACNA1D gene encodes the alpha-1D subunit of the Ca V 1.3 L-type calcium channel, which is integral to various physiological processes in human cells. These channels are crucial for calcium ion influx in response to membrane depolarization, playing a significant role in muscle contraction, hormone secretion, and neuronal signaling. In the cardiac system, Ca V 1.3 channels are predominant in the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, where they facilitate diastolic depolarization necessary for normal cardiac pacemaking (Ortner2020De; Zamponi2015The). In the endocrine system, they are involved in insulin release from pancreatic beta cells and aldosterone synthesis in the adrenal cortex (Ortner2020De; Reinbothe2012The). In the central nervous system, Ca V 1.3 channels contribute to neuronal excitability, synaptic plasticity, memory formation, and mood regulation (Ortner2020De; Zamponi2015The). They are also essential for hearing, as they facilitate calcium influx in cochlear hair cells, triggering neurotransmitter release (Ortner2020De). The channels activate at more negative membrane potentials compared to other L-type channels, allowing them to sustain calcium entry during specific phases of cellular activity (Koschak2001α1D).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CACNA1D gene, which encodes the Cav1.3 voltage-gated L-type calcium channels, are associated with a range of clinical conditions. Homozygous loss-of-function mutations in CACNA1D can lead to congenital sinus node dysfunction and deafness, a condition known as SANDD (sinoatrial node dysfunction and deafness) (Rinné2022Whole). Heterozygous mutations in this gene have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, including epileptic seizures, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Rinné2022Whole; Hofer2020Biophysical). Specific mutations, such as p.Arg930His, have been identified in families with syndromal phenotypes that include sinus node dysfunction and epilepsy, with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern (Rinné2022Whole).

De novo missense mutations in CACNA1D, such as S652L, have been associated with severe neurodevelopmental disorders and ASD, often accompanied by seizures and muscle hypotonia (Hofer2020Biophysical). These mutations typically result in gain-of-function changes in Cav1.3 channels, leading to enhanced calcium currents, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of these disorders (Ortner2020De; Hofer2020Biophysical). Additionally, somatic mutations in CACNA1D have been found in aldosterone-producing adenomas, linking the gene to primary hyperaldosteronism (Ortner2020De).

## Interactions
The CACNA1D gene encodes the Cav1.3 subunit of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels, which participate in various protein interactions crucial for their function in midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Cav1.3 forms a macromolecular complex with SK3 and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, specifically HCN2 and HCN4, which are important for regulating pacemaking activity in these neurons (Belghazi2024HighResolution). These interactions have been confirmed through techniques such as co-immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, and proximity ligation assays (Belghazi2024HighResolution).

Cav1.3 channels also interact with the Rab-interacting molecule-binding protein Rimbp2, which promotes their clustering at the active zone, although this interaction was found with low significance (Belghazi2024HighResolution). Additionally, the study identified interactions with the Pex5-related protein Pex5r and the Rimbp2 binding interactant Munc 13 (Unc13c gene) (Belghazi2024HighResolution). These interactions suggest a complex network of protein associations that contribute to the functional regulation of Cav1.3 channels in neuronal activity.
