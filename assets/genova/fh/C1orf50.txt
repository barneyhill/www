# C1orf50

## Overview
C1orf50 is a gene located on chromosome 1 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 1 open reading frame 50. This protein is conserved across metazoan species and is implicated in various cellular processes, including protein folding and metabolism, through its interactions with other proteins such as adenosylhomocysteinase (Duek2019Worming). In the context of cancer, particularly breast and endometrial cancers, C1orf50 expression is associated with cell cycle regulation and cancer progression, making it a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Otani2024The; Kusonmano2018Identification). Additionally, alterations in C1orf50 expression have been observed in response to epigenetic treatments in acute myeloid leukemia, further highlighting its role in disease pathology (Asmaa2020Transcriptomic). Despite its involvement in these critical pathways, the specific molecular functions and interactions of the C1orf50 protein remain to be fully elucidated.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
C1orf50 has been implicated in various cancer types, particularly breast cancer and endometrial cancer. In breast cancer, high expression levels of C1orf50 are associated with poor prognosis, especially in Luminal A subtype breast cancer. This gene is linked to increased cell cycle activity, cancer stemness, and immune evasion, which contribute to cancer progression. High C1orf50 expression correlates with increased sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors, suggesting potential therapeutic implications (Otani2024The). 

In endometrial cancer, C1orf50 is part of the MEME1 subnetwork, which shows increased expression from hyperplasia to metastases, indicating its role in aggressive disease phenotypes (Kusonmano2018Identification). 

C1orf50 expression is also significantly altered in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines treated with epigenetic modifiers, suggesting its involvement in the cellular response to such treatments (Asmaa2020Transcriptomic). 

Additionally, a microdeletion involving C1orf50 has been identified in a patient with genetic generalized epilepsy, although the specific clinical significance of C1orf50 in this context remains unclear (Ivanova2018Three). 

These findings suggest that C1orf50 may serve as a prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target in certain cancers.

## Interactions
C1orf50, a gene conserved across metazoa, has been shown to participate in specific protein-protein interactions. In yeast two-hybrid assays, the ortholog of C1orf50, WBGene00007436/C08B11.9, was found to interact with sip-1, a chaperone, and adenosylhomocysteinase ahcy-1. This interaction with AHCY has also been observed in humans and flies, where it was detected using validated two-hybrid assays (Duek2019Worming). These interactions suggest a role for C1orf50 in cellular processes related to protein folding and metabolism.

In the context of breast cancer, C1orf50 expression is associated with various cellular pathways. High expression levels correlate with increased activity in the MITOTIC_SPINDLE gene set and decreased activity in pathways related to mitochondrial function, immune response, and estrogen reactivity. C1orf50 is also positively correlated with components of the cyclin D:CDK4/6 and cyclin E:CDK2 complexes, which are crucial for cell cycle progression in breast cancer (Otani2024The). However, specific physical interactions of C1orf50 with other proteins or nucleic acids in these pathways have not been detailed in the available literature.
