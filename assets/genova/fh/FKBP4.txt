# FKBP4

## Overview
FKBP4 is a gene that encodes the FKBP prolyl isomerase 4 protein, commonly referred to as FKBP52, which is a member of the immunophilin family. This protein functions as a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase and is involved in various cellular processes, including protein folding, stabilization, and the regulation of steroid hormone receptor activity. FKBP52 is characterized by its multidomain structure, which includes an FK1 domain with peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity, a non-catalytic FK2 domain, and a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain that facilitates interactions with heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) (Kolos2018FKBP; Riggs2007Noncatalytic). These interactions are crucial for the assembly and function of steroid receptor complexes, impacting processes such as hormone signaling and microtubule dynamics (Riggs2007Noncatalytic; Blair2015The). FKBP52's role extends to the regulation of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway and RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) assembly, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and gene expression regulation (Chambraud2021Decrease; Martinez2013The).

## Structure
FKBP4, also known as FKBP52, is a protein encoded by the FKBP4 gene and is a member of the immunophilin family. It shares 70% sequence identity with FKBP51 and has a similar tertiary structure (Kolos2018FKBP). The protein contains several distinct domains: an N-terminal FK1 domain with peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) activity, a FKBP-like domain (FK2) without isomerase activity, and a C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain (Kolos2018FKBP; Riggs2007Noncatalytic). The FK1 domain is crucial for binding to immunosuppressive drugs like Rapamycin and FK506, sharing 53% amino acid identity with FKBP12 (Kolos2018FKBP).

The TPR domain facilitates interactions with Hsp90, which is essential for FKBP52's role in steroid hormone receptor complexes (Riggs2007Noncatalytic; SchieneFischer2015Multidomain). FKBP52's ability to enhance receptor function is linked to its structural features, particularly the loop containing amino acid P119 in the FK1 domain (Riggs2007Noncatalytic). Phosphorylation of FKBP52 can modulate its activity, suggesting post-translational modifications play a role in its function (Kolos2018FKBP). The protein's involvement in microtubule dynamics and hormone signaling highlights its multifaceted role in cellular processes (Riggs2007Noncatalytic; Blair2015The).

## Function
The FKBP4 gene encodes the FKBP52 protein, which is a member of the immunophilin family and functions as a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase. This protein is involved in various molecular processes, including protein folding and stabilization, and plays a significant role in steroid receptor function by facilitating the translocation of activated receptors to the nucleus (Scammell2003Organization). FKBP52 interacts with the androgen receptor (AR) and its chaperone Hsp90, enhancing androgen binding and upregulating AR-mediated transcription, which is crucial for the development of male phenotypic characteristics (E2021The).

In healthy human neurons, FKBP52 is localized in the lysosomal system, suggesting a role in lysosome function and the regulation of microtubule dynamics, axonal transport, and neurite outgrowth (Chambraud2021Decrease). It is also involved in the autophagy-lysosomal pathway, a major intracellular clearance system that degrades damaged organelles and protein aggregates (Chambraud2021Decrease). FKBP52's interaction with the dynein complex suggests a role in retrograde lysosomal transport, which is important for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Chambraud2021Decrease). Additionally, FKBP52 is implicated in the regulation of Argonaute2 (Ago2) protein expression and the assembly of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which is essential for post-transcriptional gene silencing (Martinez2013The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FKBP4 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In the context of androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS), particularly partial AIS (PAIS), a novel FKBP4 gene variant, p.Leu319Pro, has been identified in a patient lacking AR gene mutations. This mutation affects the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain crucial for FKBP4's interaction with Hsp90, impacting androgen receptor signaling. The mutation is considered causative due to its conserved position and absence in SNP databases, suggesting FKBP4 as a candidate gene for AIS diagnosis (E2021The).

In neurodegenerative diseases, FKBP4 is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Decreased FKBP4 levels in neurons correlate with abnormal tau protein accumulation, affecting the autophagy-lysosomal pathway and contributing to tauopathy progression. FKBP4's role in lysosomal positioning and MAPT secretion suggests its involvement in AD pathology (Chambraud2021Decrease).

In cancer, FKBP4 is overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), where it enhances tumor progression through the IKK/NF-κB signaling pathway. High FKBP4 expression is linked to poor prognosis and aggressive cancer phenotypes, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Zong2021FKBP4).

## Interactions
FKBP4, also known as FKBP52, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function. It interacts with the ligand-binding domain of nuclear steroid hormone receptors, such as the human estrogen receptor α (hERα), through its FK1 domain, which possesses peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) activity. This interaction involves the V364-PGF367 sequence of hERα, which adopts a type II β-turn conformation and binds to FKBP52 in a manner similar to its interaction with macrolide immunomodulators like rapamycin (Byrne2016A).

FKBP4 also forms complexes with the 90-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90), facilitated by its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain. This interaction is essential for the assembly of steroid receptor complexes, including the glucocorticoid receptor/Hsp90/immunophilin heterocomplex (Peattie1992Expression; Wu20043D). The TPR domain of FKBP52 binds to the C-terminal MEEVD sequence motif of Hsp90, which is critical for these interactions (Wu20043D).

Additionally, FKBP4 interacts with cytoplasmic dynein, a motor protein, to facilitate the retrograde movement of the glucocorticoid receptor along microtubules. This interaction is independent of its PPIase activity and is crucial for the nuclear translocation of the glucocorticoid receptor (Galigniana2001Evidence).
