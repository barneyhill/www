# DIMT1

## Overview
DIMT1 is a gene that encodes the DIM1 rRNA methyltransferase and ribosome maturation factor, a protein crucial for ribosome biogenesis and cellular function. This protein is categorized as a methyltransferase, specifically involved in the methylation of 18S rRNA, which is essential for the assembly and function of the small ribosomal subunit. DIM1 rRNA methyltransferase operates as an S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-dependent enzyme, facilitating the N6,N6 dimethylation of adenosine residues, a modification critical for ribosomal stability and pre-rRNA processing. Beyond its catalytic role, DIM1 is integral to the structural assembly of the 40S ribosomal subunit, with its presence being necessary for early nucleolar pre-rRNA processing. The protein's interactions with various ribosome assembly factors and its involvement in cellular processes such as mitochondrial function underscore its multifaceted role in cellular growth and metabolism (Verma2020DIMT1; Gonskikh2023Noncatalytic; Zorbas2015The).

## Structure
The DIMT1 protein is a human 18S rRNA methyltransferase involved in ribosome assembly and translation. It functions as an S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase, installing N6,6 dimethyladenosine (m2 6,6 A) at specific sites in 18S rRNA (Shen2020Structural). The protein features a Rossman fold, a common structural motif in RNA methyltransferases, which contributes to its substrate recruitment and specificity (Schapira2015Structural). 

DIMT1's structure includes several positively charged side chains, such as Arg162, Arg174, Lys201, Arg228, Lys253, and Arg256, which are crucial for RNA substrate binding. The α helix I, containing Lys253 and Arg256, is conserved in eukaryotes but absent in prokaryotes, indicating differences in substrate affinity or selectivity (Shen2020Structural). The cofactor-binding site of DIMT1 is characterized by a unique structural arrangement where the amino-acid tail of SAM relocates at the substrate binding cavity, forming a less enclosed but more hydrophobic pocket (Schapira2015Structural).

The catalytic activity of DIMT1 is essential for protein translation, while its structural scaffold is necessary for the assembly of the 40S ribosomal subunit (Shen2020Structural). The protein's role in ribosome biogenesis is conserved across species, highlighting its importance in cellular processes (Zorbas2015The).

## Function
The DIMT1 gene encodes a methyltransferase involved in ribosome biogenesis, specifically in the methylation of 18S rRNA, which is crucial for the assembly and function of the small ribosomal subunit. DIMT1 is responsible for the N6,N6 dimethylation of adenosine residues at positions A1850 and A1851 on the 18S rRNA. This methylation is essential for stabilizing the ribosomal subunit and ensuring proper pre-rRNA processing, which is necessary for the formation of mature ribosomal subunits and efficient protein synthesis (Verma2020DIMT1; Zorbas2015The).

DIMT1 is primarily active in the nucleolus, where it plays a critical role in the early stages of ribosome assembly. Its presence, rather than its catalytic activity, is required for early nucleolar pre-rRNA processing steps, highlighting its importance in maintaining the structural integrity of pre-rRNA and facilitating ribosome assembly (Zorbas2015The). In β-cells, DIMT1 is also implicated in mitochondrial function, where its deficiency can lead to impaired mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, affecting cellular metabolism and insulin secretion (Verma2020DIMT1). These functions underscore DIMT1's essential role in cellular growth and metabolism.

## Clinical Significance
The DIMT1 gene has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in ribosomal RNA processing and ribosome maturation. In multiple myeloma (MM), DIMT1 acts as a proto-oncogene, with its expression upregulated during disease progression from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) to symptomatic MM and plasma cell leukemia. This upregulation correlates with increased expression of IRF4 and MYC, suggesting DIMT1 as a potential diagnostic marker for MM progression and a marker of poor prognosis (Ikeda2017Hypoxia‐inducible). Hypoxia-inducible microRNA-210 (miR-210) downregulates DIMT1, affecting the DIMT1-IRF4 oncogenic axis, which is crucial for myeloma cell survival under hypoxic conditions (Ikeda2017Hypoxia‐inducible).

In osteosarcoma, DIMT1 is targeted by microRNA-545-5p (miR-545-5p), which acts as a tumor suppressor. miR-545-5p inhibits osteosarcoma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by downregulating DIMT1. The overexpression of miR-545-5p leads to reduced tumor growth, indicating its therapeutic potential in osteosarcoma by targeting DIMT1 (Zhou2021MicroRNA‑545‑5p).

In gastric cancer, DIMT1 is a target of miR-210, which is epigenetically silenced during chronic Helicobacter pylori infection. This silencing leads to increased DIMT1 expression, contributing to enhanced gastric epithelial cell proliferation and potentially to gastric cancer development (Kiga2014Epigenetic).

## Interactions
DIMT1 is involved in several physical interactions with nucleic acids and proteins, playing a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis. It binds to 18S rRNA, which is essential for its nucleolar localization and function in ribosome assembly (Gonskikh2023Noncatalytic). The protein has a positively charged cleft that facilitates RNA binding, involving residues such as Arg162, Arg174, Arg228, Lys253, and Arg256. These residues are critical for DIMT1's interaction with 18S rRNA, particularly helix 45 (Gonskikh2023Noncatalytic).

DIMT1 also interacts with ribosome assembly factors such as BMS1 and DHX37, which are important for its role in ribosome assembly (Gonskikh2023Noncatalytic). In the context of acute myeloid leukemia, DIMT1's RNA binding ability is crucial for its phase separation and nucleolar localization, which are necessary for its function in cell proliferation (Gonskikh2023Noncatalytic).

In addition to its interactions with rRNA, DIMT1 is involved in the stabilization of interactions between NOB-1 and PES-1, which are important for ribosomal assembly and protein synthesis in β-cells (Verma2020DIMT1). These interactions highlight DIMT1's multifaceted role in ribosome biogenesis and cellular function.
