# MSRB2

## Overview
Methionine sulfoxide reductase B2 (MSRB2) is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial enzyme belonging to the methionine-R-sulfoxide reductase family. The protein product of MSRB2 plays a pivotal role in cellular antioxidant defense mechanisms by repairing oxidatively damaged methionine residues in proteins, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and protecting against oxidative stress (Cabreiro2008Overexpression; Aachmann2011Structural). Structurally, MSRB2 is characterized as a beta-strand rich globular protein with a catalytic cysteine that is essential for its enzymatic activity (Aachmann2011Structural). Functionally, MSRB2 is involved in regulating actin dynamics and the cytokinetic abscission checkpoint, which are crucial for proper cell division and genetic stability (Bai2020Actin). Additionally, MSRB2 interacts with various proteins, including those involved in mitophagy, highlighting its role in mitochondrial function and cellular stress responses (Lee2019Mitochondrial). The clinical significance of MSRB2 is underscored by its association with diseases characterized by oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, such as diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease, making it a potential therapeutic target (Lee2019Mitochondrial; Xiang2019Mitochondrial).

## Structure
The MSRB2 protein is a mitochondrial enzyme that belongs to the methionine-R-sulfoxide reductase family. Structurally, it is characterized as a beta-strand rich globular protein, comprising eight antiparallel beta-strands and three N-terminal alpha-helical segments (Aachmann2011Structural). This configuration distinguishes it from other family members like MsrB1, and it more closely resembles bacterial MsrBs (Aachmann2011Structural). The protein's active site includes a catalytic cysteine, Cys162, which is exposed to the solvent and plays a crucial role in its enzymatic activity (Aachmann2011Structural). The structure also features a zinc-binding site, which is essential for maintaining its structural integrity (Aachmann2011Structural).

MSRB2 does not contain a resolving cysteine, which is a notable difference from some other methionine sulfoxide reductases (Aachmann2011Structural). The protein's catalytic mechanism involves a Cys-Arg-Asp/Glu triad, with Asp152 and Arg160 positioned near the catalytic Cys (Aachmann2011Structural). The N-terminal region of MSRB2 is relatively immobile, which may influence its catalytic mechanism (Aachmann2011Structural). The protein can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, and it may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation.

## Function
Methionine sulfoxide reductase B2 (MSRB2) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in cellular antioxidant defense by repairing oxidatively damaged methionine residues in proteins. It is primarily active in the mitochondria, where it contributes to the protection of cells against oxidative stress by reducing methionine sulfoxide to methionine (Cabreiro2008Overexpression; Aachmann2011Structural). MSRB2 is involved in the regulation of actin dynamics, particularly during the cytokinetic abscission checkpoint, which is crucial for proper cell division and preventing tetraploidy. It selectively reduces oxidized actin monomers, promoting their repolymerization into filaments, which is essential for stabilizing the intercellular bridge (ICB) during cell division (Bai2020Actin).

In addition to its role in actin regulation, MSRB2 is involved in the abscission checkpoint, interacting with components such as Aurora B and ANCHR to delay abscission in the presence of chromatin bridges or nuclear pore defects, thereby preventing binucleation and tetraploidization (Bai2020Actin). MSRB2's enzymatic activity is crucial for its function, as demonstrated by the inability of a catalytically inactive version to restore normal abscission timing (Bai2020Actin). Overall, MSRB2 is essential for maintaining genetic stability during cell division and protecting cells from oxidative damage.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MSRB2 gene have been linked to several diseases characterized by oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. In diabetes mellitus, increased expression of MSRB2 enhances platelet mitophagy, which helps protect against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis and may reduce the risk of thrombosis (Lee2019Mitochondrial). Conversely, in Parkinson's disease, reduced MSRB2 expression is associated with decreased mitophagy, suggesting a potential link between MSRB2 levels and neurodegenerative processes (Lee2019Mitochondrial).

In Alzheimer's disease, decreased levels of MSRB2 have been observed in the hippocampus and cortex of affected individuals, implicating it in the disease's pathology. MSRB2 overexpression has been shown to reduce amyloid-beta production and Tau phosphorylation, key features of Alzheimer's disease, by modulating oxidative stress and related signaling pathways (Xiang2019Mitochondrial).

In leukemia, overexpression of MSRB2 in MOLT-4 cells provides protection against oxidative stress-induced cell death, suggesting its potential role in cellular defense mechanisms against oxidative damage (Cabreiro2008Overexpression). These findings highlight the clinical significance of MSRB2 in various diseases, making it a potential therapeutic target for conditions associated with oxidative stress.

## Interactions
MSRB2, also known as methionine sulfoxide reductase B2, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. MSRB2 has been identified as a binding partner of LG72, a protein linked to mitochondrial function and psychiatric disorders. This interaction was confirmed using a yeast two-hybrid screen and a modified LUMIER assay, which demonstrated a specific interaction in HEK-293 cells (Otte2014Identification).

In the context of mitophagy, MSRB2 interacts with Parkin, a ubiquitin E3 ligase, and LC3, a component of autophagosomes. These interactions are essential for the regulation of mitophagy, particularly under oxidative stress conditions. MSRB2 reduces methionine sulfoxide on Parkin, facilitating its activity and subsequent interaction with LC3, which is crucial for the removal of damaged mitochondria (Lee2019Mitochondrial).

MSRB2 also plays a role in the cytokinetic abscission checkpoint by interacting with actin and proteins such as Aurora B and ANCHR. It reduces oxidized actin monomers, promoting actin polymerization and stabilizing the intercellular bridge during cell division. This function is critical for preventing tetraploidy and ensuring proper cell division (Bai2020Actin).
