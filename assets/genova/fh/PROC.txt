# PROC

## Overview
The PROC gene encodes protein C, a vitamin K-dependent serine protease that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of blood coagulation. Protein C is primarily synthesized in the liver and circulates in the plasma as an inactive zymogen. Upon activation by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex on endothelial cells, it is converted into activated protein C (APC), which functions as an anticoagulant by inactivating coagulation factors Va and VIIIa, thereby preventing excessive thrombin formation and clotting (Zhao2020Targeted; Esmon1981Identification). Beyond its anticoagulant properties, APC exhibits cytoprotective effects, including anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic activities, and contributes to maintaining endothelial barrier integrity (Zhao2020Targeted). Mutations in the PROC gene can lead to protein C deficiency, significantly increasing the risk of venous thromboembolism (Tang2012Genetic). The structural complexity and multifaceted functions of protein C underscore its critical role in hemostasis and its potential implications in thrombotic disorders (Dahlbäck2005Regulation).

## Structure
Protein C, encoded by the human PROC gene, is a vitamin K-dependent serine protease involved in the regulation of blood coagulation. Its molecular structure is composed of several distinct domains: a γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla)-rich domain, two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, a short activation peptide, and a serine protease (SP) domain (Dahlbäck2005Regulation). The Gla domain is essential for binding calcium ions, which is crucial for the proper folding of the protein and its interaction with negatively charged phospholipid membranes and the endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) (Dahlbäck2005Regulation).

The primary structure of Protein C includes a sequence of amino acids that form these specific domains. The secondary structure consists of alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains into a complex three-dimensional shape necessary for its activity. Post-translational modifications, such as gamma-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues, are critical for the protein's function (Long1987Structure).

Protein C shares sequence homology with other vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors, including factors VII, IX, X, and prothrombin, indicating a conserved evolutionary pathway (Long1987Structure).

## Function
The PROC gene encodes protein C, a vitamin K-dependent serine protease that plays a crucial role in regulating blood coagulation. In healthy human cells, protein C is activated to form activated protein C (APC) through cleavage by thrombin in complex with thrombomodulin and the endothelial cell protein C receptor (EPCR) on the endothelial surface (Zhao2020Targeted). APC functions as an anticoagulant by degrading activated coagulation factors Va and VIIIa, thereby inhibiting thrombin formation and preventing excessive clotting (Zhao2020Targeted).

Beyond its anticoagulant properties, APC exhibits cytoprotective effects, including antiapoptotic and anti-inflammatory activities, and stabilizes the endothelial barrier. These effects are mediated through interactions with EPCR and protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) (Zhao2020Targeted). APC also plays a role in protecting against septic lethality and inhibiting histone cytotoxicity (Zhao2020Targeted).

The PROC gene's product, protein C, is primarily active in the bloodstream, where it maintains hemostatic balance and reduces the risk of thrombosis by modulating coagulation pathways and cellular responses (Zhao2020Targeted).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PROC gene are associated with protein C deficiency, a condition that significantly increases the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism. In particular, the recurrent mutation c.565C.T (p.Arg189Trp) is prevalent in the Chinese population and is linked to an 8.8-fold increased risk of venous thrombosis. This mutation affects the EGF-2 domain of protein C, potentially impairing its activation and interaction with other molecules, which is crucial for its anticoagulant function (Tang2012Genetic).

The PROC gene mutations can lead to both type I and type II protein C deficiencies. Type I deficiency is characterized by reduced levels of protein C, while type II deficiency involves normal protein levels but reduced activity. The Arg189Trp mutation is associated with type II deficiency due to its reduced affinity for the endothelial protein C receptor, affecting anticoagulant activity (Li2023Evaluation).

Other mutations, such as Lys193del, also contribute to VTE risk and are found in a significant portion of patients with thrombotic events. These mutations often coexist with other genetic or acquired risk factors, exacerbating the risk of thrombosis (Li2023Evaluation).

## Interactions
Protein C (PROC) interacts with several proteins that are crucial for its role in anticoagulation. It is activated by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex on endothelial cells, a process enhanced by the presence of thrombomodulin, which acts as a cofactor (Esmon1981Identification; HACKENG1996Protein). Once activated, protein C (APC) inactivates coagulation factors Va and VIIIa, with protein S serving as a cofactor to enhance this inactivation (Suzuki1983Inactivation; HACKENG1996Protein). 

Protein S amplifies the anticoagulant activity of APC by enhancing the inactivation of factor Va, leading to a concentration-dependent inhibition of prothrombin activation (HACKENG1996Protein). The interaction between APC and factor Va involves specific residues, such as those in the 311-325 sequence of APC, which are critical for recognizing and binding to factor Va (Mesters1993Interactions). 

Additionally, the endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) and thrombomodulin enhance the activation of protein C by thrombin, facilitating its anticoagulant function (HACKENG1996Protein). These interactions are essential for the regulation of blood coagulation and the prevention of excessive clot formation.
