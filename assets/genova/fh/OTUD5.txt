# OTUD5

## Overview
OTUD5 is a gene that encodes the protein OTU deubiquitinase 5, a cysteine protease involved in the removal of ubiquitin from specific protein substrates. This protein is categorized as a deubiquitinating enzyme and plays a critical role in regulating protein stability, localization, and activity by cleaving K48- and K63-linked ubiquitin chains. OTU deubiquitinase 5 is primarily localized in the nucleus and is involved in various cellular processes, including maintaining genomic integrity, immune response modulation, and chromatin remodeling, which is essential for neural differentiation. The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as UBR5, SPT16, and TRIM25, highlight its significance in transcriptional regulation and DNA repair mechanisms. Mutations in the OTUD5 gene are linked to developmental disorders and various cancers, underscoring its clinical importance (Beck2021Linkagespecific; Fu2023The).

## Structure
OTUD5 is a deubiquitinating enzyme characterized by its OTU domain, which is essential for its catalytic activity. This domain is approximately 120 amino acids long and serves as the catalytic center of the protein (Fu2023The). The protein also contains a ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM) at the C-terminus, which is crucial for interactions with various proteins, including TRIM25 and SPT16 (de2018The; Li2020OTUD5). The N-terminal region, comprising the first 212 amino acids, is necessary for interaction with UBR5 and YAP, with the first 17 amino acids being critical for UBR5 stabilization (Fu2023The; de2018The).

OTUD5 is primarily localized in the nucleus, with residues 33-70 being crucial for its nuclear localization (de2018The). The protein's activity is regulated by phosphorylation at Ser177, which is necessary for its activation (Beck2021Linkagespecific; Fu2023The). OTUD5 shows a preference for cleaving K48 and K63 ubiquitin chains, which are involved in protein degradation and signal transduction, respectively (Fu2023The). The protein's structure allows it to interact with chromatin remodelers, playing a significant role in chromatin remodeling and neural differentiation (Beck2021Linkagespecific). OTUD5 can exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context.

## Function
OTUD5 (OTU deubiquitinase 5) is a cysteine protease involved in the deubiquitination of proteins, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, OTUD5 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it regulates protein stability, localization, and activity through the removal of ubiquitin chains, specifically K48- and K63-linked chains (Beck2021Linkagespecific; Fu2023The).

OTUD5 is essential for maintaining genomic integrity and immune balance. It stabilizes the STING protein by cleaving its K48-linked polyubiquitin chain, enhancing the antiviral IFN-I response, which is vital for controlling DNA virus infections (Fu2023The). In DNA damage response, OTUD5 regulates the FACT complex and Ku80, promoting non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair by stabilizing Ku80, thus supporting genomic stability (Fu2023The; de2018The).

OTUD5 also plays a significant role in neuroectodermal differentiation by stabilizing chromatin remodelers, preventing their degradation, and ensuring proper chromatin remodeling necessary for neural cell fate commitment (Beck2021Linkagespecific). This function is critical during early differentiation, as evidenced by its involvement in preventing chromatinopathies affecting neuroectodermal differentiation (Beck2021Linkagespecific).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the OTUD5 gene are associated with a developmental disorder known as LINKED syndrome (LINKage-specific deubiquitylation deficiency-induced Embryonic Defects). This condition is characterized by multiple congenital anomalies, including craniofacial, cardiac, skeletal, and genitourinary defects, as well as developmental delays and intellectual disabilities. LINKED syndrome results from the impaired deubiquitylation activity of OTUD5, which is crucial for chromatin remodeling during embryogenesis (Beck2021Linkagespecific).

Specific mutations, such as p.Gly494Ser and p.Leu352Pro, lead to severe phenotypes, including craniofacial malformations and structural brain anomalies. These mutations disrupt the K48-specific deubiquitylation activity of OTUD5, affecting the stability of chromatin remodelers necessary for neuroectodermal differentiation (Beck2021Linkagespecific).

OTUD5 is also implicated in various cancers, acting as either a tumor suppressor or promoter depending on the context. Its expression is upregulated in bladder cancer and downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma, cervical cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer. In these cancers, OTUD5 influences pathways such as mTOR and Hippo, affecting tumor progression and metastasis (Fu2023The).

## Interactions
OTUD5 (OTU deubiquitinase 5) is known to interact with several proteins, playing significant roles in various cellular processes. It interacts with UBR5, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, through its N-terminal region, which is crucial for UBR5 stabilization. This interaction is necessary for regulating transcription at damaged chromatin sites, as OTUD5 and UBR5 together influence the enrichment of the FACT complex at these sites, affecting histone deposition (de2018The).

OTUD5 also interacts with SPT16, a component of the FACT complex, through its UIM domain. This interaction is important for transcriptional regulation at DNA damage sites and is involved in the repression of FACT activity, which is crucial for maintaining genomic integrity (de2018The).

In addition, OTUD5 interacts with TRIM25, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and this interaction is important for regulating cell proliferation and tumor progression. OTUD5 deubiquitinates TRIM25, affecting the expression of the tumor suppressor PML and influencing TRIM25-related signaling pathways (Li2020OTUD5).

OTUD5 also plays a role in DNA repair by interacting with Ku80, a protein involved in non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). OTUD5 stabilizes Ku80 by preventing its ubiquitination-mediated degradation, which is essential for its accumulation at DNA damage sites (Li2019The).
