# CCDC182

## Overview
CCDC182 is a gene that encodes the protein coiled-coil domain containing 182, which is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil motifs. These motifs are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the CCDC182 protein may play a role in various cellular processes through such interactions. While the specific biological functions of the CCDC182 protein are not fully understood, it has been implicated in several physiological and pathological contexts, including kidney disease and male gonad development. Research has highlighted its potential involvement in RNA processing and cilia-related functions, indicating a broader significance in cellular and developmental biology (Gao2019Analysis; Wu2022Discovering; Gable2019ZCCHC8).

## Clinical Significance
The CCDC182 gene has been implicated in several health conditions, particularly in the context of kidney disease and male gonad development. In non-diabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD), the CCDC182 gene has been associated with an increased risk. A study identified a significantly higher frequency of the AT genotype of CCDC182 in non-diabetic CKD patients, suggesting its potential role in kidney pathogenesis and its clinical significance in identifying individuals at risk for this condition (Wu2022Discovering).

In the realm of reproductive health, CCDC182 has been identified as one of the upregulated genes in the development of male gonads. This suggests that CCDC182 may play a role in testis development, although specific clinical implications in this context are not detailed (Gao2019Analysis).

Additionally, CCDC182 has been mentioned in studies related to RNA processing and cilia-related functions. In Zcchc8 knockout mice, which exhibit neurodevelopmental defects, CCDC182 was among the cilia-related genes affected, indicating its potential involvement in ciliopathy-related phenotypes (Gable2019ZCCHC8). However, the direct clinical significance of CCDC182 in these contexts remains to be fully elucidated.
