# KLF14

## Overview
KLF14, or Krüppel-like factor 14, is a gene that encodes a transcription factor belonging to the Krüppel-like factor family, characterized by its C2H2-type zinc finger domains. These domains facilitate the binding of the KLF14 protein to GC-rich regions of DNA, playing a pivotal role in regulating gene expression across various physiological systems, including cardiovascular, metabolic, and immune systems (Akash2023Biochemical; Yang2020Transcription). The KLF14 protein functions as both a transcriptional activator and repressor, influencing processes such as lipid metabolism, insulin signaling, and genomic stability (Wu2022Differential; Fan2015Loss). Located on chromosome 7q32.3, KLF14 is maternally imprinted and expressed in tissues like muscle, brain, and liver (Chen2020The). Its clinical significance is underscored by its involvement in metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, and its role as a tumor suppressor in various cancers (Zhou2023KLF14; Alanazi2023Biochemical).

## Structure
KLF14 is a member of the Krüppel-like factor family, characterized by its conserved C2H2-type zinc finger domains located at the C-terminal. These domains are crucial for binding to GC-rich regions of genes and consist of three structural motifs, with the first and second domains comprising 25 and 23 amino acid residues, respectively (Akash2023Biochemical; Yang2020Transcription). The zinc finger domains are joined by Kruppel-links and contain positively charged amino acids, which may aid in nuclear localization (ParkerKatiraee2005Identification; Akash2023Biochemical).

The primary structure of KLF14 includes a Sin3A binding domain at the N-terminus, which is involved in repressor activity (Zahra2022Determining). The tertiary structure of KLF14 was modeled using KLF4 as a template, showing 61.45% sequence identity, and the model is of good stereochemical quality as indicated by the Ramachandran plot (Zahra2022Determining). KLF14 is an intronless gene, suggesting it may have arisen through retrotransposition, and it shares 58% identity with KLF16, particularly in the zinc-finger domains (ParkerKatiraee2005Identification). The gene is maternally imprinted and located on chromosome 7q32.3 (Chen2020The).

## Function
KLF14 (Kruppel-like factor 14) is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression in various organ systems, including the cardiovascular, renal, digestive, respiratory, immunological, and hematopoietic systems. It is involved in cell signaling pathways that control cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, differentiation, and other physiological activities. KLF14 is expressed in mammalian tissues such as muscle, brain, fat, and liver, with monoallelic maternal expression (Wu2022Differential).

In healthy human cells, KLF14 is essential for maintaining homeostasis and regulating metabolic processes. It activates the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway to increase insulin sensitivity and mediates lipid signaling, which is important for metabolic phenotypes. KLF14 influences adipogenesis, insulin signaling, lipid metabolism, inflammatory and immune responses, and cell proliferation and differentiation (Wu2022Differential). It acts as a transcriptional activator involved in lipid metabolism and signaling, particularly in endothelial cells, by regulating chromatin remodeling on the sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) gene, leading to the production of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a critical lipid signaling molecule (de2014New).

KLF14 also plays a role in maintaining genomic stability by limiting Plk4 transcription to maintain centrosome integrity, thereby suppressing tumorigenesis (Fan2015Loss).

## Clinical Significance
KLF14 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to mutations, alterations in expression levels, or changes in its interactions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), KLF14 expression is significantly downregulated in tumor tissues compared to non-tumor tissues, correlating with poor prognosis and factors such as tumor size and TNM stage. Overexpression of KLF14 inhibits liver cancer cell growth, suggesting its role in tumor suppression through modulation of iron metabolism (Zhou2023KLF14).

KLF14 is also associated with metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and dyslipidemia. The rs4731702 polymorphism in KLF14 is linked to insulin resistance and cardiovascular diseases, with the C allele increasing the risk of T2DM and lowering HDL-C levels (Alanazi2023Biochemical). Variants in KLF14 are associated with body shape indices and metabolic traits, particularly in females, and may uncouple adiposity from cardiometabolic risks (Wu2022Differential).

In cancer, KLF14 acts as a tumor suppressor, with its deficiency leading to centrosome amplification and tumorigenesis. This suggests its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target for cancer (Fan2015Loss). KLF14 reduction is also linked to breast cancer progression, indicating its role in tumor suppression (Alzahrani2023Potential).

## Interactions
KLF14 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It is known to interact with the transcriptional co-repressor Sin3A, which is crucial for its repressor activity. This interaction involves a specific amino acid sequence (AAECL) at the N-terminus of KLF14, allowing it to function as a transcriptional repressor (Zahra2022Determining). KLF14 also acts as a transcriptional repressor of Plk4, a key regulator of centriole duplication, by inhibiting its transcription and protein expression. This interaction is significant in controlling centrosome amplification and maintaining genomic stability (Fan2015Loss).

In hepatocellular carcinoma cells, KLF14 interacts with SIRT1, a deacetylase, to repress the expression of iron-responsive element-binding protein 2 (IRP2). This interaction reduces histone acetylation at the IRP2 promoter, affecting iron homeostasis and tumor growth (Zhou2023KLF14). KLF14 also binds to GC-rich regions in the SK1 promoter, interacting with the histone acetyltransferase p300 to activate SK1 expression, which is involved in lipid signaling pathways (de2014New). These interactions highlight KLF14's dual role in gene regulation, functioning as both a repressor and activator depending on the context.
