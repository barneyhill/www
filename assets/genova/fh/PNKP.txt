# PNKP

## Overview
The PNKP gene encodes the polynucleotide kinase 3'-phosphatase, a bifunctional enzyme that plays a pivotal role in DNA repair mechanisms. This enzyme is categorized as a kinase and phosphatase due to its dual catalytic activities, which involve phosphorylating 5'-hydroxyl termini and dephosphorylating 3'-phosphate termini of DNA strands. These activities are crucial for the repair of single-strand and double-strand breaks, facilitating the restoration of DNA integrity. The polynucleotide kinase 3'-phosphatase is active in both the nucleus and mitochondria, where it interacts with various DNA repair proteins to maintain genomic stability. Mutations in the PNKP gene have been linked to several neurological disorders, underscoring its significance in normal cellular function and organismal health (Weinfeld2011Tidying; Bernstein2005The; Zolner2011Phosphorylation).

## Structure
The human gene PNKP encodes the polynucleotide kinase 3'-phosphatase, a bifunctional enzyme involved in DNA repair. The protein's primary structure includes specific amino acid sequences that form distinct domains: a kinase domain and a phosphatase domain. The secondary structure features alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the enzyme's functional conformation (Garces2011The).

The tertiary structure of PNKP involves the folding of these domains into a three-dimensional conformation, crucial for its enzymatic functions. The phosphatase domain contains a narrow channel that binds single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and coordinates a magnesium ion essential for catalytic activity (Garces2011The). Key residues such as Asp170 and Arg258 are critical for substrate binding and catalysis, with mutations in these residues significantly affecting enzyme activity (Garces2011The).

The kinase domain exhibits an induced-fit mechanism, with structural rearrangements upon binding to DNA and ADP. This domain accommodates undistorted duplex DNA upstream of the 5′-terminus but requires DNA distortion for phosphotransfer from ATP (Garces2011The). Helix a13 plays a crucial role in stabilizing DNA distortion by inserting into the DNA and providing a hydrophobic wedge and charged interactions (Garces2011The).

PNKP may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its activity and interactions. The enzyme's structural plasticity allows it to perform two enzymatic reactions necessary for DNA repair, highlighting its importance in maintaining genomic stability (Garces2011The).

## Function
The human gene PNKP encodes the enzyme polynucleotide kinase 3'-phosphatase, which plays a critical role in DNA repair processes. PNKP is involved in the repair of both single-strand breaks (SSBs) and double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA. It performs dual catalytic activities: phosphorylating 5'-hydroxyl termini and dephosphorylating 3'-phosphate termini, which are essential for preparing DNA ends for subsequent repair by DNA polymerases and ligases (Weinfeld2011Tidying; Bernstein2005The).

PNKP is active in both the nucleus and mitochondria, where it interacts with other DNA repair proteins such as XRCC1 and XRCC4. These interactions are facilitated by its N-terminal forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, which binds to phosphorylated motifs on these proteins, enhancing the enzyme's turnover rate at DNA breaks (Weinfeld2011Tidying; subedi2015role). The enzyme's phosphatase activity is particularly crucial, as it is more active than its kinase activity, prioritizing the removal of 3'-phosphate groups when both 5'-OH and 3'-P termini are present (subedi2015role).

PNKP's function is vital for maintaining genomic stability, particularly in neural cells, and its activity is modulated by phosphorylation, which regulates its association with DNA damage sites and interaction with other repair proteins (Zolner2011Phosphorylation). Mutations in PNKP are linked to neurological disorders, highlighting its importance in normal cellular function and organismal health (Weinfeld2011Tidying).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PNKP gene are associated with several neurological disorders due to its critical role in DNA repair. One of the primary conditions linked to PNKP mutations is microcephaly with early-onset seizures and developmental delay (MCSZ). This autosomal recessive disorder is characterized by microcephaly, seizures, and developmental delays, often resulting from defective DNA strand break repair. Specific mutations, such as L176F, E326K, T424Gfs48X, and exon15fs4X, lead to reduced PNKP protein levels and compromised enzymatic activity, contributing to the disease pathology (Reynolds2012Impact; Dumitrache2017Polynucleotide).

Another condition associated with PNKP mutations is ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 4 (AOA4), which involves neurodegeneration, ataxia, and oculomotor apraxia. The phenotypic variability in individuals with PNKP mutations suggests the involvement of genetic modifiers that impact the gene's function (Dumitrache2017Polynucleotide; Bras2015Mutations).

PNKP mutations have also been implicated in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2B2, where compound heterozygosity for specific variants leads to severe axonal sensory-motor polyneuropathy and cerebellar atrophy (Leal2018The). These conditions highlight the diverse clinical manifestations resulting from PNKP dysfunction and underscore the gene's importance in maintaining genomic stability in the nervous system.

## Interactions
PNKP (polynucleotide kinase 3'-phosphatase) is a crucial enzyme in DNA repair processes, interacting with various proteins and nucleic acids. It plays a significant role in single-strand break repair by interacting with XRCC1, a scaffolding protein that enhances PNKP's kinase and phosphatase activities. XRCC1 binds to PNKP in both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms, with phosphorylated XRCC1 interacting with the FHA domain of PNKP and non-phosphorylated XRCC1 binding to its catalytic domain (Mani2019Domain). This interaction is essential for recruiting PNKP to sites of DNA damage and stimulating its activity (Mani2019Domain).

PNKP is also phosphorylated by DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) and ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase, which regulates its association with DNA damage sites. Phosphorylation at serines 114 and 126 is crucial for its function in DNA double-strand break repair, affecting its retention at damage sites and its enzymatic activities (Zolner2011Phosphorylation). PNKP interacts with XRCC4 and DNA ligase IV, enhancing DNA-PK-dependent rejoining of non-homologous end joining substrates, particularly after ionizing radiation (Zolner2011Phosphorylation).

PNKP also binds to various DNA substrates, showing a higher affinity for double-stranded DNA with 3'-phosphate termini, which is crucial for stable complex formation (HavaliShahriari2017Characterization).
