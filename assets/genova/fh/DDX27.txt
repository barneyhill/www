# DDX27

## Overview
DDX27 is a gene that encodes the protein DEAD-box helicase 27, which is a member of the DEAD-box family of RNA helicases. These proteins are characterized by the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD) and are involved in various aspects of RNA metabolism, including translation initiation, splicing, and ribosome assembly (Jin2022DEADBox). The DDX27 protein is primarily localized in the nucleolus and plays a crucial role in ribosomal RNA (rRNA) maturation, which is essential for ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis (Zheng2023Role). It is involved in the processing of 47S rRNA and is associated with the PeBow complex, which is critical for ribosome assembly (Li2021DEADbox). DDX27 has been implicated in various cellular processes, including muscle differentiation and cancer progression, where it influences pathways such as NF-κB signaling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Jin2022DEADBox; Tang2018DEADbox). Its expression and activity are linked to the proliferation and differentiation of muscle progenitor cells, as well as the progression of several cancers, making it a significant focus of biomedical research (Jin2022DEADBox; Bennett2017RNA).

## Function
DDX27 (DEAD-box helicase 27) is a nucleolar protein that plays a critical role in ribosomal RNA (rRNA) maturation, which is essential for ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis in cells (Zheng2023Role; Bennett2017RNA). This function is vital for maintaining the protein synthesis machinery, contributing to cellular growth and proliferation. DDX27 is involved in the processing of 47S rRNA and is associated with the PeBow complex, which is crucial for ribosome assembly (Li2021DEADbox).

In skeletal muscle, DDX27 is expressed in Pax7 positive satellite cells and MyoD expressing nuclei, indicating its role in the proliferation and differentiation of muscle progenitors. Its expression is high in proliferating satellite cells and myoblasts but decreases as cells commit to terminal differentiation into myotubes (Bennett2017RNA). DDX27 is localized in the nucleoli of human myoblasts, co-localizing with UBF and Fibrillarin, suggesting its involvement in rDNA transcription and pre-rRNA processing (Bennett2017RNA).

DDX27 also plays a role in modulating translational processes, maintaining the balance between proliferation and differentiation of muscle progenitor cells, and is crucial for muscle growth and regeneration (Bennett2017RNA).

## Clinical Significance
DDX27 (DEAD-box helicase 27) has been implicated in several cancers due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), DDX27 is frequently amplified, leading to increased mRNA and protein expression. This overexpression is associated with poor prognosis, as it enhances cell proliferation, migration, and invasion while inhibiting apoptosis. DDX27 promotes tumor growth and metastasis through the NF-κB signaling pathway by interacting with nucleophosmin (NPM1), which enhances NF-κB's DNA binding activity (Tang2018DEADbox).

In gastric cancer (GC), high DDX27 expression correlates with poor clinical outcomes, including worse overall survival. It promotes metastasis by triggering the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) process and is associated with increased invasion and metastasis (Jin2022DEADBox). DDX27 also regulates the expression of the lipoma-preferred partner (LPP), which is involved in cell adhesion and motility, further contributing to cancer progression (Jin2022DEADBox).

In breast cancer, DDX27 is overexpressed and linked to larger tumor size, positive lymph nodes, and higher histological grade. It enhances stem cell-like properties in cancer cells, promoting proliferation and migration, and is associated with poor prognosis in terms of overall and disease-free survival (Li2021DEADbox).

## Interactions
DDX27, a DEAD-box helicase, is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that contribute to its role in cancer progression and cellular processes. In colorectal cancer, DDX27 interacts with nucleophosmin (NPM1) to enhance the DNA binding activity of NF-κB p65, promoting NF-κB signaling. This interaction is crucial for the oncogenic effects of DDX27, as it facilitates the transcription of NF-κB target genes (Tang2018DEADbox). The interaction between DDX27 and NPM1 was confirmed through various assays, including coimmunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation (Tang2018DEADbox).

In gastric cancer, DDX27 influences the alternative splicing of the lipoma-preferred partner (LPP), which is involved in cell adhesion and motility. This interaction is significant for DDX27-mediated metastasis and is linked to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process (Jin2022DEADBox).

In skeletal muscle, DDX27 is localized in the nucleolus and is involved in ribosome biogenesis by influencing rRNA maturation and processing. It co-localizes with nucleolar components such as UBF and Fibrillarin, indicating its role in rRNA synthesis and ribosome assembly (Bennett2017RNA).
