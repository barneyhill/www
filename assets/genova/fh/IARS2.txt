# IARS2

## Overview
The IARS2 gene encodes the mitochondrial enzyme isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase 2, which is a member of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (ARS) family. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of isoleucine to its corresponding mitochondrial tRNA, a critical step in translating mitochondrial DNA-encoded proteins (Ma2020RNAimediated; Vona2018Expanding). IARS2 is synthesized in the cytoplasm and subsequently imported into the mitochondria, where it contributes to the maintenance of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complexes, essential for cellular energy production (Dong2024IARS2). Mutations in the IARS2 gene are linked to several mitochondrial disorders, including Leigh syndrome and CAGSSS syndrome, underscoring its importance in mitochondrial function and human health (Schwartzentruber2014Mutation; Dong2024IARS2).

## Structure


## Function
The IARS2 gene encodes the mitochondrial isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, an enzyme crucial for protein synthesis within mitochondria. This enzyme catalyzes the attachment of the amino acid isoleucine to its corresponding mitochondrial tRNA (mt-tRNA Ile), a critical step in the translation of mitochondrial DNA-encoded proteins (Ma2020RNAimediated; Vona2018Expanding). IARS2 is synthesized in the cytoplasm and then imported into the mitochondria, where it performs its function (Ma2020RNAimediated).

The proper functioning of IARS2 is essential for maintaining mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes, particularly complexes I and III, which are vital for energy production in cells (Dong2024IARS2). In healthy human cells, IARS2 supports mitochondrial integrity and function by ensuring efficient protein synthesis, which is necessary for cellular energy metabolism (Dong2024IARS2).

IARS2 is part of a larger family of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs), which are evolutionarily conserved enzymes responsible for catalyzing the attachment of amino acids to their corresponding tRNAs. This process is a prerequisite for translating genetic sequences into polypeptide chains, highlighting the gene's fundamental role in cell biology (Vona2018Expanding).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IARS2 gene are associated with a range of mitochondrial disorders, reflecting its critical role in mitochondrial protein synthesis. One of the primary conditions linked to IARS2 mutations is Leigh syndrome, a severe neurological disorder characterized by progressive loss of mental and movement abilities, developmental delays, and specific brain abnormalities (Dong2024IARS2; Braga2023Compound). Patients with Leigh syndrome often exhibit symptoms such as global developmental delay, hypotonia, epilepsy, and diffuse encephalopathy (Braga2023Compound).

Another condition associated with IARS2 mutations is CAGSSS syndrome, which includes cataracts, growth hormone deficiency, sensorineural hearing loss, peripheral sensory neuropathy, and skeletal dysplasia (Schwartzentruber2014Mutation; Vona2018Expanding). This syndrome highlights the diverse clinical phenotypes that can result from IARS2 mutations, which may also include isolated cataracts or cataracts with skeletal dysplasia (Vona2018Expanding).

IARS2 mutations have also been linked to West syndrome, characterized by spastic seizures and intellectual disability, and sideroblastic anemia with hypoparathyroidism (Zhou2024A; Gong2023IARS2related). These mutations can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, affecting tissues with high metabolic demand, such as the central nervous system, and can result in endocrine disorders due to impaired mitochondrial ATP production (Gong2023IARS2related).
