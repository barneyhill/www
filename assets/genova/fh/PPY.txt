# PPY

## Overview
The PPY gene encodes the pancreatic polypeptide (PP), a member of the neuropeptide Y (NPY) family, which is a group of regulatory peptides involved in various physiological processes. This gene is primarily expressed in the pancreas, where it is secreted by the γ-cells of the islets of Langerhans. The pancreatic polypeptide is a 36-amino acid peptide that plays a significant role in modulating pancreatic secretion, gastrointestinal motility, and appetite regulation through its action on G protein-coupled receptors, particularly the Y4 receptor (Saito2022Establishment; Holzer2012Neuropeptide). The structure of the PPY gene and its encoded protein is highly conserved, reflecting its evolutionary significance and functional importance in energy balance and metabolic homeostasis (Michael2002The). Despite its involvement in these critical processes, the absence of PPY does not significantly impact glucose levels or body weight under normal conditions, suggesting a modulatory rather than a primary role in metabolic regulation (PerezFrances2021Pancreatic).

## Structure
The pancreatic polypeptide (PPY) gene encodes a peptide hormone composed of 36 amino acids. The primary structure of PPY is a linear sequence of amino acids, which is highly conserved across various species, although it shows variability in amphibians and reptiles (Michael2002The). The secondary structure of PPY includes two anti-parallel helices connected by a type II β-turn, forming a characteristic 'PP-fold' (Michael2002The). This conformation is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and is crucial for maintaining the peptide's functional integrity in solution.

The tertiary structure of PPY is defined by its overall three-dimensional shape, which is maintained by specific conserved residues such as Pro5, Pro8, and Gly9, essential for the polyproline helix and β-turn (Michael2002The). The PPY protein does not exhibit a quaternary structure as it functions as a monomer. Common post-translational modifications include amidation at the C-terminus, which is typical for peptides in the neuropeptide Y family (Michael2002The). The gene's exon/intron organization is similar to that of other members of the neuropeptide Y family, reflecting its evolutionary origin from a common ancestral gene (Hort1995Gene).

## Function
The PPY gene encodes pancreatic polypeptide (PP), a 36-amino acid peptide primarily secreted by γ-cells in the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. PP is part of the neuropeptide Y (NPY) family and acts on G protein-coupled Y receptor superfamily proteins, particularly the Y4 receptor, to modulate various physiological processes (Saito2022Establishment). In healthy human cells, PP plays a role in regulating pancreatic secretion activities and gastrointestinal motility. It is released postprandially and influences appetite by affecting central neural circuits, thereby modulating food intake and energy balance (Holzer2012Neuropeptide).

PP is involved in the regulation of glucose homeostasis and has been shown to suppress feeding, reduce body weight, increase energy consumption, and improve insulin resistance and dyslipidemia in experimental models (Saito2022Establishment). Despite its role in appetite control, the inactivation of the PPY gene in mice did not significantly affect blood glucose levels or body weight under normal conditions, suggesting that PPY might not be critical for maintaining glucose levels in healthy conditions (PerezFrances2021Pancreatic). This indicates that PPY may have a fine-tuning role in response to significant stress rather than a primary role in normal conditions (PerezFrances2021Pancreatic).

## Interactions
Pancreatic polypeptide (PPY) interacts with specific receptors in the body, primarily influencing glucagon release and other metabolic processes. PPY is part of the neuropeptide Y (NPY) family and interacts with the Y family of inhibitory G-protein-coupled receptors. It has a high affinity for the Y4 receptor, also known as PPYR1, which is expressed in glucagon-containing alpha-cells in both mouse and human pancreatic islets. This interaction suggests a paracrine regulatory mechanism where PPY modulates glucagon secretion by inhibiting its release through the PPYR1 receptor (Aragón2015Pancreatic).

PPY also interacts with other receptors in the NPY receptor family, such as the PP1 receptor, which shows high affinity for PPY and peptide YY (PYY). The PP1 receptor is expressed in various human tissues, including the colon, small intestine, pancreas, and prostate, indicating its role in mediating the effects of PPY in these tissues (Lundell1995Cloning). These interactions highlight the role of PPY in regulating metabolic homeostasis and its potential influence on gastrointestinal and pancreatic functions.
