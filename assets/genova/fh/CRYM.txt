# CRYM

## Overview
The CRYM gene encodes the protein crystallin mu (μ-crystallin), which is a cytosolic protein primarily involved in thyroid hormone transport and regulation. As an NADPH-dependent binding protein, μ-crystallin plays a crucial role in modulating the bioavailability of the thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (T3) within cells, influencing gene expression related to growth, metabolism, and development (Hallen2011Mammalian; Borel2014Crystal). Additionally, μ-crystallin functions as a ketimine reductase, participating in amino acid metabolism, particularly within the pipecolic acid pathway in the brain (Hallen2011Mammalian). The protein's structure includes a Rossmann fold for NADPH binding and a putative T3-binding site, facilitating its role in thyroid hormone interaction (Borel2014Crystal; Cheng2007Crystal). CRYM's expression is notably high in the brain, where it may influence neuronal survival, and its altered expression has been linked to various neurological and auditory conditions, including Huntington's disease and nonsyndromic deafness (Francelle2014Loss; Oshima2006CRYM).

## Structure
The CRYM protein, also known as human μ-crystallin, is a cytosolic protein that plays a role in thyroid hormone transport and gene regulation. Its molecular structure has been elucidated through crystallography, revealing important details about its organization. The primary structure of CRYM includes specific amino acid sequences that form distinct domains. The secondary structure is characterized by a combination of alpha helices and beta sheets. The dimerization domain consists of residues 2-112 and 195-311, forming a seven-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, three α-helices, and three 3_10 helices (Cheng2007Crystal).

The tertiary structure of CRYM includes a Rossmann fold in the NADPH-binding domain, which is typical for dinucleotide-binding proteins. This domain, containing residues 113-294, is responsible for binding NADPH, a cofactor that influences the protein's conformation and function (Cheng2007Crystal). The quaternary structure of CRYM involves the formation of a stable dimer through a hydrophobic interface, which buries a significant portion of the accessible surface area per subunit (Cheng2007Crystal).

CRYM's structure also includes a putative T3-binding site, identified through structural comparisons with homologs, suggesting its role in thyroid hormone binding (Cheng2007Crystal). The protein's ability to bind T3 is facilitated by hydrophobic interactions and specific hydrogen bonds (Borel2014Crystal).

## Function
The CRYM gene encodes the protein μ-crystallin, which functions as an NADPH-dependent cytosolic binding protein for the thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (T3). This protein plays a crucial role in regulating intracellular T3 bioavailability and its transactivation to the nucleus, where T3 can influence gene expression related to growth, metabolism, and development (Hallen2011Mammalian; Borel2014Crystal). CRYM is also identified as a ketimine reductase, involved in amino acid metabolism, particularly in the pipecolic acid pathway, which is the main lysine catabolic pathway in the adult mammalian brain (Hallen2011Mammalian). 

CRYM's enzymatic activity is regulated by T3, which acts as a strong inhibitor, suggesting a significant role in modulating amino acid metabolism and T3 activity within cells (Hallen2011Mammalian). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and is involved in the transportation of T3 to the nucleus, facilitating its binding to thyroid hormone receptor-containing dimers that interact with genomic thyroid responsive elements (Francelle2014Loss). CRYM's expression is notably high in the brain, particularly in the striatum, and it may play a role in neuronal cell death and survival (Francelle2014Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the CRYM gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. CRYM mutations are associated with nonsyndromic deafness, primarily due to their impact on thyroid hormone binding in the cochlea. These mutations can disrupt the potassium ion recycling system in the cochlea, leading to hearing loss (Wang2020Identification; Oshima2006CRYM). A specific mutation, c.152C>T (Pro51Leu), has been identified in a Chinese family with hereditary sensorineural hearing loss, suggesting its pathogenic role (Wang2020Identification).

In Huntington's disease (HD), CRYM expression is significantly reduced in the striatum, a brain region particularly vulnerable to the disease. This reduction may increase the susceptibility of striatal neurons to mutant huntingtin toxicity, and overexpression of CRYM has been shown to have a neuroprotective effect (Francelle2014Loss).

CRYM expression is also altered in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), with decreased expression observed in degenerating pyramidal tracts. This suggests a potential link between CRYM expression changes and neurodegenerative conditions (Hommyo2018Expression). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CRYM in various neurological and auditory conditions.

## Interactions
CRYM (crystallin mu) is involved in various protein-protein interactions, particularly in the context of neurological and metabolic processes. In astrocytes, especially within the striatum, CRYM is part of a 78-protein interactome identified using proximity-dependent biotinylation. This interactome includes proteins involved in nucleic acid binding, intracellular signal transduction, and cytoskeletal binding. Notable interactors include SYNGAP1, DLGAP2, DLGAP3, BCR, CLINT1, GSTM1, and MT-ND5, some of which are associated with psychiatric disorders (Ollivier2024Crympositive).

CRYM also interacts with thyroid hormones, particularly triiodothyronine (T3), through strong binding facilitated by specific amino acid residues. This interaction is crucial for modulating thyroid hormone availability and activity within cells (Kinney2021µCrystallin:). CRYM's binding to T3 is characterized by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding, which are essential for its role in thyroid hormone transport and regulation (Borel2014Crystal).

In prostate cancer, CRYM interacts with thyroid hormone signaling pathways, affecting gene expression and reducing the invasive potential of cancer cells by interfering with T3 signaling (Aksoy2019Thyroid). These interactions highlight CRYM's multifaceted role in cellular signaling and its potential implications in various diseases.
