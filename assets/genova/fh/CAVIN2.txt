# CAVIN2

## Overview
CAVIN2, also known as serum deprivation response protein (SDPR), is a gene that encodes the caveolae associated protein 2, a critical component of the cavin protein family. This protein plays a pivotal role in the biogenesis and function of caveolae, which are small, flask-shaped invaginations in the plasma membrane involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and lipid regulation. Caveolae associated protein 2 is characterized by its ability to form homo- and hetero-oligomers, which are essential for the structural integrity and assembly of caveolae. It interacts with membrane lipids, particularly phosphatidylserine, facilitating its recruitment to caveolar membranes and influencing membrane curvature. The protein's structure includes conserved alpha-helical regions and disordered domains that undergo post-translational modifications, impacting its function and stability (Kovtun2015Cavin).

## Structure
CAVIN2, also known as serum deprivation response protein (SDPR), is a member of the cavin protein family involved in the formation and function of caveolae. The protein structure of CAVIN2 includes conserved alpha-helical regions, specifically within two domains known as HR1 and HR2, which are separated by three disordered regions (DR1, DR2, and DR3) (Kovtun2015Cavin). These disordered regions are characterized by a highly acidic sequence profile and are sites for extensive post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, SUMOylation, and ubiquitylation (Kovtun2015Cavin). Phosphorylation sites are primarily located within these disordered regions and are linked to cellular signaling pathways, although their precise functional significance remains unclear (Kovtun2015Cavin).

CAVIN2 is known to form homo- and hetero-oligomers, which are crucial for the assembly of caveolae (Kovtun2015Cavin). The HR1 domain is a conserved and highly extended parallel trimeric coiled-coil, essential for cavin-cavin interactions and the assembly of the cavin coat (Kovtun2015Cavin). The protein also interacts with membrane lipids, particularly phosphatidylserine, which is important for its recruitment to caveolar membranes (Kovtun2015Cavin). CAVIN2 undergoes accelerated proteasome-dependent degradation when not associated with caveolae, suggesting a role for ubiquitylation in its turnover (Kovtun2015Cavin).

## Function
CAVIN2, also known as serum deprivation protein response (SDPR), is a crucial component in the formation and function of caveolae, which are small invaginations in the plasma membrane. In healthy human cells, CAVIN2 plays a significant role in modulating the morphology of caveolae by inducing membrane curvature and forming caveolae-associated tubules. This function is essential for the structural integrity of caveolae, influencing their shape and potentially their internalization and transport processes (Sowa2012Caveolae; Briand2011Cavin).

CAVIN2 interacts with other cavin proteins, particularly cavin-1, to promote the recruitment of these proteins to caveolae, although this interaction does not require caveolin-1. This interaction is vital for the assembly of caveolae, as downregulation of CAVIN2 leads to a loss of cavin-1 and caveolin expression, thereby limiting caveolae formation (Kovtun2015Cavin; Briand2011Cavin).

CAVIN2 is highly expressed in tissues such as the lung and fat, where it correlates with smaller cavin complexes due to the accumulation of low-molecular-mass cavin oligomers. This suggests a tissue-specific role in modulating the properties of caveolae, particularly in endothelial cells (Kovtun2015Cavin). The protein's ability to bind phosphatidylserine and its involvement in membrane curvature further highlight its role in caveolae assembly and function (Kovtun2015Cavin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CAVIN2 gene, also known as caveolae associated protein 2, have been implicated in various diseases. In breast cancer, CAVIN2 is significantly downregulated, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor. This downregulation is associated with advanced tumor stages and poor prognosis, particularly in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer. CAVIN2's expression levels are linked to overall survival and relapse-free survival in breast cancer patients, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Tian2021Integrated).

In the context of lung function, mutations or alterations in CAVIN2 can lead to abnormal lung function and potentially contribute to lung injury. The gene is associated with lung function phenotypes such as forced vital capacity (FVC) and peak expiratory flow (PEF). Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the CAVIN2 gene region, like rs1128965, have been linked to lung function impairment and are involved in classical signaling pathways related to lung injury, such as ERK1/2, AKT, and STAT3 (Li2022Revealing).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of CAVIN2 in both cancer and pulmonary conditions, underscoring its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
CAVIN2, also known as caveolae associated protein 2, is involved in the formation and function of caveolae through its interactions with other proteins. CAVIN2 is a major phosphatidylserine-binding protein, with binding sites in the HR1 and HR2 domains, which are crucial for its recruitment to caveolar membranes (Kovtun2015Cavin). It forms higher-order oligomers necessary for caveolar formation, often interacting with other cavin proteins such as CAVIN1 and CAVIN3. CAVIN2 can form heterotrimers with CAVIN1, but it does not associate with CAVIN3, leading to their segregation into separate subcomplexes on caveolae surfaces (Kovtun2015Cavin; Gambin2014Singlemolecule).

CAVIN2's interactions are influenced by specific phospholipids, such as phosphatidylserine and PtdIns(4,5)P2, which help maintain an equilibrium between its cytoplasmic and membrane-associated states (Kovtun2015Cavin). The HR1 domain of CAVIN2, which forms a trimeric coiled-coil structure, is essential for its oligomerization and interaction with membranes (Kovtun2014Structural). These interactions are crucial for the structural organization of caveolae and their associated functions in cellular processes (Kovtun2014Structural).
