# OR4A16

## Overview
OR4A16 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily A member 16, which is a part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as an olfactory receptor, playing a pivotal role in the detection and transduction of odorant signals within the olfactory system. The OR4A16 gene is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds to specific odor molecules, contributing to the complex process of smell perception (Jimenez2021The). The gene exhibits a high mutation rate, which can influence olfactory sensitivity and varies significantly among individuals (Jimenez2021The). Beyond its primary role in olfaction, OR4A16 has been implicated in studies investigating genetic variants linked to pancreatic cancer, although its precise function in non-pathological contexts remains to be fully elucidated (Wei2012Insights).

## Function
OR4A16 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the olfactory system by initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. OR4A16 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, contributing to the diversity of olfactory signals processed by the brain (Jimenez2021The).

The mutational landscape of OR4A16, along with other olfactory receptors, reveals a high mutation rate, with some members exhibiting more than 500 mutations per receptor. These mutations include missense and synonymous substitutions, which can impact the receptor's function and, consequently, olfactory sensitivity (Jimenez2021The). The genetic diversity within the OR gene repertoire, including OR4A16, suggests significant interindividual variation in olfactory sensitivity across different populations (Jimenez2021The).

In addition to its role in olfaction, OR4A16 has been identified in studies exploring genetic variants associated with pancreatic cancer, although its specific function in healthy human cells remains less clear (Wei2012Insights).
