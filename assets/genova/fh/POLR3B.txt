# POLR3B

## Overview
POLR3B is a gene that encodes the RNA polymerase III subunit B, a critical component of the RNA polymerase III (Pol III) complex. This protein is essential for the transcription of small non-coding RNAs, such as transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and 5S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), which are vital for protein synthesis and various cellular processes. As a subunit of Pol III, POLR3B plays a significant role in the catalytic activity of the enzyme, working in conjunction with other subunits to ensure proper transcriptional function. The protein is categorized as a polymerase subunit and is involved in complex interactions necessary for the assembly and stability of the Pol III complex. Mutations in the POLR3B gene are linked to a spectrum of genetic disorders, including POLR3-related leukodystrophies, which manifest with neurological and non-neurological symptoms (Kulhánek2018POLR3Bassociated; Pinard2022Riluzole).

## Structure
The POLR3B gene encodes a subunit of RNA polymerase III, which is involved in the transcription of small non-coding RNAs. The primary structure of POLR3B consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the POLR3B gene. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's overall stability and function. The tertiary structure refers to the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is crucial for its interaction with other subunits and its role in the polymerase complex.

In terms of quaternary structure, POLR3B interacts with other subunits to form a functional RNA polymerase III complex. This interaction is essential for the assembly and stability of the enzyme. Specific domains within POLR3B are critical for its function, including regions that interact with other subunits like POLR3K, as seen in studies involving mutations that disrupt these interactions (Yee2007Mutation).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate the activity of POLR3B, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. Splice variant isoforms of POLR3B can result in different functional forms of the protein, potentially affecting its role in transcription (Saitsu2011Mutations).

## Function
POLR3B encodes a subunit of RNA polymerase III (Pol III), which is crucial for the transcription of small non-coding RNAs, including transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and 5S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) (Pinard2022Riluzole). These RNAs are essential for protein synthesis and various cellular processes, such as transcription, RNA processing, and translation (Tétreault2011Recessive). POLR3B, along with POLR3A, forms the catalytic center of Pol III, facilitating the enzyme's role in synthesizing these small RNAs (Tétreault2011Recessive).

In healthy human cells, POLR3B is a critical component of the Pol III complex, which is composed of 17 subunits. The assembly of this complex involves the formation of subcomplexes that include POLR3B and other subunits, such as POLR1C, POLR1D, and POLR3E (Pinard2022Riluzole). The proper assembly and function of Pol III are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and gene expression regulation (Pinard2022Riluzole).

POLR3B is active in the nucleoplasm, where it contributes to the regulation of gene expression by transcribing small RNAs necessary for cellular function (Pinard2022Riluzole). The interaction of POLR3B with other subunits and cofactors is crucial for the proper assembly and function of Pol III, highlighting its importance in cellular processes (Pinard2022Riluzole).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the POLR3B gene are associated with a group of rare genetic disorders known as POLR3-related leukodystrophies. These disorders include 4H leukodystrophy, characterized by hypomyelination, hypodontia, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and other conditions such as Hypomyelination with Oligodontia (HO) and Tremor-Ataxia with Central Hypomyelination (TACH) (Kulhánek2018POLR3Bassociated; Verberne20204H). Patients with these disorders often present with neurological symptoms like motor dysfunction, cerebellar atrophy, and intellectual disabilities, as well as non-neurological symptoms such as dental abnormalities and delayed puberty (Kulhánek2018POLR3Bassociated; Wolf2014Clinical).

Specific mutations, such as the c.308G > A (p.Arg103His) mutation, have been shown to cause severe developmental consequences, including embryonic lethality in homozygous mice, indicating a critical role in RNA polymerase III biogenesis (Choquet2019The). Other mutations, like large exonic deletions, have also been identified and contribute to the disease phenotype by disrupting normal RNA synthesis (Gutierrez2015Large). The clinical presentation of POLR3B-related disorders is highly variable, with some patients experiencing severe symptoms while others have milder forms, highlighting the complexity of these genetic conditions (Verberne20204H).

## Interactions
POLR3B, a subunit of RNA polymerase III, is involved in several critical interactions necessary for the assembly and function of the Pol III complex. It interacts with other subunits such as POLR3A, POLR1C, POLR1D, and POLR3E, forming distinct subcomplexes essential for the proper assembly of the Pol III enzyme. These interactions are crucial for the recruitment of GPN proteins, which are involved in the nuclear translocation and assembly processes of the Pol III complex (Pinard2022Riluzole).

The R103H mutation in POLR3B, associated with leukodystrophy, impairs these interactions, particularly affecting the early stages of Pol III assembly. This mutation leads to reduced interactions with subunits like POLR3D, POLR3E, and POLR1C, as well as with chaperones such as HSP70 and HSP90, which are involved in POLR3B folding and assembly (Pinard2022Riluzole).

In zebrafish, a mutation in POLR3B disrupts its interaction with the subunit Polr3k (Rpc11), leading to developmental defects. This interaction is vital for RNA cleavage and Pol III recycling, highlighting the importance of POLR3B's role in maintaining Pol III function (Yee2007Mutation).
