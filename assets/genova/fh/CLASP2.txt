# CLASP2

## Overview
CLASP2, or cytoplasmic linker associated protein 2, is a gene that encodes a microtubule-associated protein involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics. The protein plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including cell division, motility, and neuronal development, by stabilizing microtubule plus-ends and facilitating their interactions with other cellular structures (Pereira2006Mammalian; Lawrence2020CLASPs). CLASP2 is characterized by the presence of conserved Tumor Overexpressed Gene (TOG) domains, which are essential for its interaction with tubulin and its function in microtubule dynamics (Lawrence2018Human). The protein exists in multiple isoforms, each with distinct structural features that influence its cellular localization and function (Lawrence2020CLASPs). CLASP2's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which affect its interactions with other proteins and its role in cellular processes (Kumar2012Multisite). The gene's expression and function have been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer, where it may serve as a biomarker for disease progression (Zhu2017CLASP2).

## Structure
The human CLASP2 protein is involved in microtubule dynamics and contains several important domains that contribute to its function. CLASP2 has multiple conserved Tumor Overexpressed Gene (TOG) domains, which are crucial for binding to tubulin and regulating microtubule dynamics (Lawrence2018Human). These TOG domains exhibit structural diversity, with distinct architectures that influence their tubulin-binding modes (Leano2019Structures). The TOG domains in CLASP2 are helical repeat modules that interact with specific conformations of αβ-tubulin (Lawrence2020CLASPs).

CLASP2 exists in three isoforms: α, β, and γ. The α isoform is the longest and contains three TOG domains, although the N-terminal TOG domain has lost its ability to interact with αβ-tubulin or microtubules (Lawrence2020CLASPs). The β isoform lacks the N-terminal TOG domain but includes a palmitoylation motif near the N-terminus, which may direct membrane localization (Lawrence2020CLASPs).

Post-translational modifications, such as multisite phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating CLASP2's interactions. Phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) disrupts the binding of CLASP2 to end-binding protein 1 (EB1), affecting its microtubule plus-end tracking ability (Kumar2012Multisite).

## Function
CLASP2 (cytoplasmic linker associated protein 2) is a microtubule plus-end-tracking protein that plays a crucial role in regulating microtubule dynamics, which is essential for various cellular processes such as cell division, motility, and neuronal development. In mitosis, CLASP2 is involved in stabilizing kinetochore-microtubule attachments and promoting robust interactions with microtubule ends, ensuring proper chromosome attachment and segregation (Pereira2006Mammalian; Lawrence2020CLASPs). It localizes to kinetochores, centrosomes, and spindles, contributing to spindle architecture and function (Pereira2006Mammalian).

In neurons, CLASP2 is critical for axonal growth and synaptic function. It stabilizes microtubules at the leading edge of migrating cells, aiding in cell polarization and directional movement (Beffert2012Microtubule; Lawrence2020CLASPs). CLASP2 also influences synaptic morphology by increasing the number and size of synapses and affecting synaptic protein levels (Beffert2012Microtubule). Its activity is modulated by phosphorylation, which affects its localization and function, particularly in neuronal growth cones (Sayas2019Distinct; Engel2014Abelson). Overall, CLASP2 is essential for maintaining cellular and neuronal function through its regulation of microtubule dynamics.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CLASP2 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer. In bladder cancer, increased levels of CLASP2 mRNA in tumor tissues and urine are associated with a higher risk of cancer progression following transurethral resection of bladder tumors. This suggests that CLASP2 may play a role in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and early cancer progression, making it a potential biomarker for disease prognosis (Zhu2017CLASP2).

In the context of mitotic processes, the absence or dysfunction of CLASP2 can lead to chromosomal instability and aneuploidy, conditions often linked to cancer. CLASP2 is crucial for maintaining mitotic fidelity by regulating spindle and kinetochore functions. Its absence results in spindle abnormalities and chromosome missegregation, which are characteristic of tumor cells (Pereira2006Mammalian).

Additionally, CLASP2 is involved in insulin action, where its knockdown affects insulin-stimulated glucose transport, indicating its role in metabolic pathways. However, specific diseases directly linked to CLASP2 mutations in this context are not detailed (Langlais2012Identification). Overall, CLASP2's role in cellular stability and signaling pathways highlights its clinical significance in cancer and potentially other conditions related to chromosomal instability.

## Interactions
CLASP2 interacts with several proteins that are crucial for its role in microtubule dynamics and cellular processes. It binds to microtubule plus-end tracking proteins such as EB1 and EB3, which are essential for regulating microtubule dynamics. The interaction with EB1 is particularly important for CLASP2's role in microtubule stabilization and is modulated by phosphorylation. Phosphorylation by GSK3β inhibits CLASP2's binding to EB1, affecting its ability to track microtubule plus ends (Kumar2012Multisite; Kumar2009GSK3β).

CLASP2 also interacts with CLIP-170 and CLIP-115, although these interactions are not essential for its targeting to microtubule tips. The COOH-terminal domain of CLASP2 is responsible for its association with the cell cortex and the Golgi complex, independent of microtubules (MimoriKiyosue2005CLASP1).

In addition to its interactions with microtubule-associated proteins, CLASP2 binds to IQGAP1, an actin-binding protein, which is regulated by GSK3β phosphorylation. This interaction is crucial for linking microtubules to actin filaments, particularly at the leading edges of migrating cells (Watanabe2009Phosphorylation).

CLASP2 also interacts with FEZ1 and NEK1 through coiled-coil regions, suggesting a role in centrosomal functions. This interaction is influenced by phosphorylation, which affects the localization and function of these proteins at the centrosome (Lanza2009FEZ1).
