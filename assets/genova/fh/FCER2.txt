# FCER2

## Overview
The FCER2 gene encodes the Fc epsilon receptor II (FcεRII), also known as CD23, which is a low-affinity receptor for immunoglobulin E (IgE). This receptor is a type II transmembrane protein characterized by a C-type lectin domain, playing a pivotal role in the immune system, particularly in allergic responses and immunity against parasitic infections. FcεRII is involved in the regulation of IgE levels, B cell growth, and differentiation, and it participates in cell adhesion processes. The gene is expressed in various cell types, including B cells, monocytes, and eosinophils, and its expression is modulated by cytokines such as interleukin-4 (IL-4) (Yokota1988Two; Capron1986Functional). Variants of FcεRII, generated through alternative splicing, contribute to its diverse functional roles in immune regulation (Yokota1988Two).

## Structure
The FCER2 gene encodes the Fc epsilon receptor II (CD23), a low-affinity receptor for IgE. This protein is a type II transmembrane protein characterized by a C-type lectin domain. The primary structure of FCER2 includes a signal peptide, as well as extracellular, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic regions. The extracellular region is responsible for IgE binding, which is crucial for its role in immune responses (Capron1986Functional).

In terms of quaternary structure, FCER2 forms trimers, which are essential for its function as a receptor. This trimeric formation allows for effective interaction with IgE molecules, facilitating its role in modulating immune responses (Capron1986Functional).

Post-translational modifications of FCER2 include glycosylation, which is common for proteins involved in immune functions. Glycosylation can affect the stability and activity of the receptor, influencing its interaction with IgE and other cellular components (Capron1986Functional).

The FCER2 protein does not have detailed information available regarding its secondary or tertiary structures, specific domains, or prominent folds in the provided context. Additionally, there is no mention of splice variant isoforms in the available sources.

## Function
The human gene FCER2 encodes the Fc epsilon receptor II (FcεRII), also known as CD23, which is a low-affinity receptor for IgE antibodies. This receptor is involved in several key processes in the immune system. It plays a significant role in B cell growth and differentiation, as well as in IgE-mediated immunity, which includes allergic reactions and immunity to parasitic infections (Yokota1988Two). 

There are two variants of FcεRII, FcεRIIa and FcεRIIb, which are generated through different transcriptional initiation sites and alternative RNA splicing. FcεRIIa is constitutively expressed on B cells and is involved in a T cell-independent process for B cell development. In contrast, FcεRIIb is expressed in various cell types, such as monocytes and eosinophils, following induction by interleukin-4 (IL-4), and is associated with the effector phase of allergy and parasitic infections (Yokota1988Two).

FcεRII/CD23 is also involved in cell adhesion and the regulation of B cell growth, acting as a critical molecule in normal B cells at specific stages of differentiation (Yokota1988Two). The receptor's expression is regulated by IL-4, which induces its expression on B cells and monocytes, highlighting its role in modulating immune responses (Defrance1987Human; Vercelli1988Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FCER2 gene, also known as CD23, have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. Genetic variations in FCER2 are associated with asthma susceptibility, particularly in North Indian children. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) such as rs28364072 and rs7249320 have been linked to an increased risk of asthma, with certain genotypes showing higher odds ratios for the disease (Sharma2013Genetic). 

In the context of cancer, FCER2 expression is notably higher in mediastinal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (med-DLBCL) compared to other forms of DLBCL. It is also associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), where CD23 positivity aids in differential diagnosis (Toydemir2012FCER2). 

In severe mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP) in children, FCER2 is upregulated, suggesting a role in bronchial inflammation and hyper-immune reactivity (Wang2017Transcriptome). Additionally, FCER2 has been identified as a candidate gene in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis, with its expression linked to oxidative stress-related damage in glial cells (Infante2015Identification).

## Interactions
FCER2, also known as CD23, is involved in various interactions that influence immune responses. It is primarily expressed on B cells and forms complexes with proteins such as CD21, CD19, and MHC class II molecules. These interactions play a crucial role in modulating B cell activation and differentiation, as well as in the regulation of IgE levels, which are important in allergic reactions and immune system functioning.

In the context of eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (eCRSwNP), FCER2 is associated with monocyte-derived macrophages that are part of the T2-high immune environment. These macrophages exhibit significant ligand-receptor interactions with basal epithelial cells, which are not observed in non-eCRSwNP samples. This suggests that FCER2 macrophages have a high number of interactions with other cells, paralleling glycolytic reprogramming in eCRSwNP (Huang2024Increased).

In nonallergic childhood asthma, FCER2 is involved in the feedback regulation of IgE production. Higher expression of FCER2 on monocytes and increased levels of soluble CD23 (sCD23) are associated with decreased IgE production. This interaction network includes IL-4 and IL-10, which are implicated in the regulation of IgE levels and asthma pathogenesis (Lee2023Differentially).
