# ZNF610

## Overview
ZNF610 is a gene located on chromosome 19q that encodes the zinc finger protein 610, a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by their zinc finger domains, which facilitate binding to DNA, RNA, or other proteins, thereby playing crucial roles in transcriptional regulation and cellular processes. Zinc finger protein 610 is implicated in various biological functions, including gene expression modulation and chromatin remodeling. Alterations in the expression and methylation of ZNF610 have been associated with several diseases, such as gastric and prostate cancers, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for disease progression and prognosis (Pudova2021Gene; Schneider2013Virulence).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZNF610 has been implicated in various diseases through alterations in its methylation and expression levels. In gastric cancer, ZNF610 shows significantly higher methylation levels in tumor tissues compared to normal mucosae, with a mean methylation of 61.8% in tumors versus 7.2% in normal tissues. This hypermethylation is associated with the presence of more virulent strains of Helicobacter pylori and chronic inflammation, suggesting a role in cancer development through epigenetic changes (Schneider2013Virulence).

In prostate cancer, particularly in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), ZNF610 expression is negatively correlated with progression-free survival. This suggests that alterations in ZNF610 expression may contribute to disease progression and could serve as a potential prognostic marker (Pudova2021Gene).

While ZNF610 is located on chromosome 19q, its specific clinical significance in the context of chromosomal microaberrations, such as those found in patients with epilepsy and intellectual disabilities, is not explicitly detailed. However, its inclusion in studies of chromosomal variations indicates potential relevance in genetic disorders (Spreiz2013Chromosomal).
