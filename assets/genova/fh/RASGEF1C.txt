# RASGEF1C

## Overview
The RASGEF1C gene encodes the protein RasGEF domain family member 1C, which functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Ras-related GTPases. This protein plays a pivotal role in intracellular signaling by facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP, thereby activating Ras proteins that are integral to cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and survival. RasGEF domain family member 1C is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is involved in pathways that regulate signal transduction and cytoskeletal organization (Jafarian2021Natural). Notably, the RASGEF1C gene is neuron-specific and has been associated with neurocognitive health, particularly in the context of late-onset neurocognitive disorders like Alzheimer's disease. Variations in the gene's (GGC) repeat region have been linked to these disorders, underscoring its potential as a genetic marker for disease susceptibility (Jafarian2021Natural; Jafarian2021Naturala).

## Function
The RASGEF1C gene encodes a protein that functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Ras-related GTPases, facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP. This activity is crucial for activating Ras proteins, which are involved in key cellular processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. The protein encoded by RASGEF1C is active in the cytoplasm, where it plays a role in intracellular signaling pathways that influence various cellular functions, including signal transduction and cytoskeletal organization (Jafarian2021Natural).

In the context of neurocognitive health, the RASGEF1C gene is neuron-specific and has been implicated in the regulation of gene expression related to cognitive function. Dysregulation of its expression is linked to late-onset neurocognitive disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, suggesting its importance in maintaining normal cognitive function (Jafarian2021Natural). The gene contains a (GGC)13 repeat in its core promoter and 5′ untranslated region, which is significant for its expression regulation. Variations in this repeat region may influence neurocognitive health, with certain alleles being more prevalent in individuals with neurocognitive disorders (Jafarian2021Natural).

## Clinical Significance
The RASGEF1C gene has been implicated in late-onset neurocognitive disorders (NCDs), such as Alzheimer's disease, due to its expression dysregulation. The gene contains a (GGC) repeat in its core promoter and 5′ untranslated region, which is the longest identified in human protein-coding genes. This repeat is associated with the regulation of gene expression and may contribute to the development of neurocognitive disorders. Studies have shown a significant enrichment of genotypes lacking the predominant 6-repeat allele in individuals with NCDs, suggesting a potential genetic marker for the disease (Jafarian2021Natural; Jafarian2021Naturala).

The presence of divergent genotypes, such as those with 7, 8, 9, and 11 repeats, has been observed exclusively in NCD patients, indicating a possible link between these genetic variations and disease pathogenesis (Jafarian2021Naturala). The 8/8 genotype, in particular, is notably more frequent in the NCD group. These findings suggest that alterations in the RASGEF1C gene's repeat region may influence susceptibility to neurocognitive disorders, highlighting the clinical significance of these genetic variations in disease development (Jafarian2021Natural). Further research is needed to understand the role of RASGEF1C in neurological disorders across diverse populations.
