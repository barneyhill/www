# KRTAP10-12

## Overview
KRTAP10-12 is a gene that encodes the keratin-associated protein 10-12, a member of the keratin-associated protein (KAP) family, which plays a crucial role in the structural integrity of human hair. This protein is categorized under the high sulfur KAPs, known for their high cysteine content, which is essential for forming disulfide bonds that contribute to the mechanical strength and resilience of hair fibers. The keratin-associated protein 10-12 is primarily expressed in the upper cuticle of the hair follicle, where it interacts with keratin intermediate filaments to form a hard and compact hair fiber. The evolutionary conservation of the KRTAP10-12 gene across various species underscores its importance in hair structure and function (Rogers2006Human; Rogers2005Human).

## Function
KRTAP10-12 is a member of the keratin-associated protein (KAP) family, specifically categorized under the high sulfur KAPs. These proteins are integral to the structure and function of human hair, particularly in the formation of the hair cuticle and cortex. KRTAP10-12 is expressed in the upper cuticle of the hair follicle, approximately 20 cell layers above the apex of the dermal papilla, where it contributes to the formation of a hard and compact hair fiber. This is achieved through multiple cross-linkings of keratin intermediate filaments with KAP proteins, enhancing the structural integrity and resilience of the hair fiber (Rogers2006Human; Rogers2005Human).

The KAP10 family, which includes KRTAP10-12, is characterized by a high cysteine content, which facilitates the formation of disulfide bonds, crucial for the mechanical strength of hair. These proteins also contain significant amounts of serine, proline, alanine, and valine, contributing to their unique structural properties (Rogers2006Human). The evolutionary conservation of the KAP10 gene domain across species such as chimpanzees and baboons suggests its fundamental role in hair structure (Rogers2006Human).
