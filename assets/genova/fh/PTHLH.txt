# PTHLH

## Overview
The PTHLH gene encodes the parathyroid hormone-like hormone (PTHrP), a multifunctional protein that shares structural similarities with parathyroid hormone (PTH) and is involved in a variety of physiological processes. PTHrP is categorized as a paracrine and autocrine signaling molecule, playing a pivotal role in the regulation of cartilage and bone development, as well as in epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. It is crucial for maintaining the balance between chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation, thereby influencing endochondral bone formation. Beyond its skeletal functions, PTHrP is implicated in processes such as tooth eruption, skin keratinization, and hair follicle cycling. The protein's ability to bind to the type I PTH/PTHrP receptor (PTH1R) allows it to exert its effects in various tissues, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and pathological conditions (Wysolmerski2012Parathyroid; Martin2016Parathyroid).

## Structure
The PTHLH gene encodes the parathyroid hormone-like hormone (PTHrP), which is a protein with significant structural homology to parathyroid hormone (PTH), particularly in the N-terminal region. This homology allows PTHrP to bind to the same receptor as PTH, the type I PTH/PTHrP receptor (PTH1R) (Wysolmerski2012Parathyroid; Wysolmerski2013Parathyroid). The PTHLH gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms of 139, 141, or 173 amino acids (Wysolmerski2012Parathyroid; Martin2016Parathyroid). 

The primary structure of PTHrP includes a leader sequence followed by regions homologous to PTH, which are crucial for receptor binding. Beyond the 13th amino acid, the sequence diverges significantly from PTH, contributing to its unique functions (Burtis1992Parathyroid). The protein undergoes extensive post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and phosphorylation, which may influence its stability and function (Burtis1992Parathyroid). 

PTHrP is characterized by several potential processing sites, such as R-R and K-R motifs, which may lead to different bioactive forms. These processing events are suggested to be tissue-specific (Burtis1992Parathyroid). The protein's structure allows it to act in an autocrine or paracrine manner, with distinct regions contributing to various physiological roles (Burtis1992Parathyroid).

## Function
The PTHLH gene encodes the parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), which plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, particularly in the development of cartilage and bone. PTHrP is essential for normal chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation, acting in a feedback loop with Indian Hedgehog (Ihh) to regulate endochondral bone formation. It stimulates chondrocyte proliferation while delaying their differentiation into prehypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes, maintaining a balance necessary for proper bone growth (Strewler2000The; Martin2016Parathyroid).

PTHrP is also involved in the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions and is crucial for skeletal development. It acts as a paracrine factor and is produced by chondrocytes and osteoblasts, with its expression closely regulated alongside its receptor, PTHR1 (Martin2016Parathyroid). In addition to its role in bone development, PTHrP influences other physiological processes, such as tooth eruption, skin keratinization, and hair follicle cycling. It regulates the size of the proliferative pool of basal keratinocytes and influences the hair growth cycle (Strewler2000The).

PTHrP also has a protective role in the central nervous system, where it inhibits calcium entry into neurons, promoting their survival and protecting against excitotoxicity (Strewler2000The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PTHLH gene are associated with several skeletal disorders. Brachydactyly type E (BDE) is a condition characterized by shortened metacarpals and metatarsals, often resulting from loss-of-function mutations in PTHLH. These mutations can include missense, nonsense, and nonstop mutations, leading to short stature and learning disabilities (Klopocki2010Deletion). 

Duplications of the PTHLH gene have been linked to various skeletal abnormalities, including enchondromatosis and chondrodysplasia. These duplications can cause conditions such as osteochondroplasia with a combined brachydactyly type E/A1 phenotype, characterized by disturbed bone maturation and rhizomelia (Flöttmann2016Duplication; Tacke2021Chondrodysplasia). 

Alterations in the regulatory landscape of PTHLH, such as chromosomal deletions near the gene, can lead to inappropriate expression and features consistent with hyperparathyroid-like disease, despite normal serum levels of related markers (Deshwar2019Disruption). 

The gene's involvement in skeletal dysplasias is further highlighted by cases of symmetrical enchondromatosis associated with duplications affecting PTHLH, suggesting altered PTHLH-PTHR1 signaling as a potential underlying mechanism (Collinson2010Symmetrical). These findings underscore the critical role of PTHLH in bone development and its impact on skeletal disorders.

## Interactions
Parathyroid hormone-like hormone (PTHLH) interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. PTHLH activates hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) through the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway during liver fibrosis development. This activation is mediated by the PTH1R-PKC h signaling axis, where PTHLH(1-40) induces PKC h phosphorylation, highlighting a specific interaction with PKC h (He2019Parathyroid).

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), PTHLH interacts with the Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), forming a positive feedback loop that promotes cell proliferation and tumor growth. This interaction influences the expression of cell cycle regulators such as CCNA2, CCNE2, and CDC25A (Chang2017Parathyroid).

PTHLH also plays a role in neuroblastoma, where it acts as a growth factor necessary for tumor growth and migration. Its expression is controlled by the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and PTHLH can promote or inhibit cell migration depending on its interaction with the PTH1R receptor (García2019Parathyroid).

PTHLH's intracrine actions involve its nuclear localization, where it can bind RNA and potentially act as a nuclear export factor, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation (Martin2016Parathyroid).
