# DISC1

## Overview
The DISC1 gene, which stands for "Disrupted in Schizophrenia 1," encodes the DISC1 scaffold protein, a multifunctional protein that plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, particularly within the nervous system. As a scaffold protein, DISC1 is involved in the organization of microtubule networks and centrosome function, which are critical for neuronal migration, neurite outgrowth, and synaptic function (Bradshaw2012DISC1binding; Morris2003DISC1). The protein's structure is characterized by distinct regions, including an intrinsically disordered N-terminal region and a largely helical C-terminal region with coiled-coil domains, facilitating interactions with numerous proteins (Cukkemane2021Conformational). DISC1's interactions with proteins such as LIS1, NDE1, and NDEL1 underscore its importance in maintaining neuronal structural and functional integrity (Brandon2009Understanding; Morris2003DISC1). Clinically, mutations and disruptions in the DISC1 gene have been linked to psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression, highlighting its significance in mental health research (Brandon2009Understanding; Mao2009Disrupted).

## Structure
The DISC1 protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes distinct regions with specific structural and functional properties. The primary structure of DISC1 consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the DISC1 gene. The secondary structure features an N-terminal region of approximately 350 residues that is intrinsically disordered, while the C-terminal region is largely helical, containing coiled-coil regions with heptad repeats (Cukkemane2021Conformational). This C-terminal region also includes antiparallel helical hairpin structures known as UVR domains (Cukkemane2021Conformational).

The tertiary structure of DISC1 involves the formation of oligomers and fibrils, with the C-terminal region forming symmetric oligomers and fibrils similar to those found in amyloid proteinopathies (Cukkemane2021Conformational). The quaternary structure is highlighted by the protein's ability to form tetramers and larger aggregates, particularly at physiological temperatures (Cukkemane2021Conformational).

DISC1 contains specific domains such as the coiled-coil domain, which facilitates interactions with other proteins like NDEL1 and LIS1 (Morris2003DISC1). Post-translational modifications include phosphorylation at S713, which influences neuronal progenitor cell migration (Cukkemane2021Conformational). The protein also exhibits splice variant isoforms, such as the DISC1 Δ22aa splice variant, which lacks the β-core region involved in fibrillization (Cukkemane2021Conformational).

## Function
The DISC1 (Disrupted in Schizophrenia 1) protein is a multifunctional scaffold protein that plays a critical role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in the organization of microtubule networks and centrosome function, which are essential for neuronal migration, neurite outgrowth, and synaptic function (Bradshaw2012DISC1binding; Morris2003DISC1). DISC1 interacts with several proteins, including LIS1, NDE1, NDEL1, and PCM1, which are crucial for microtubule organization and neuronal migration (Brandon2009Understanding; Morris2003DISC1). 

DISC1 also plays a significant role in the Wnt signaling pathway by inhibiting GSK3β, leading to increased β-catenin levels, which is important for neural progenitor proliferation and differentiation (Brandon2009Understanding; Bradshaw2012DISC1binding). At the synapse, DISC1 is associated with synaptic plasticity and spine density regulation, potentially through interactions with the actin cytoskeleton (Brandon2009Understanding). 

In terms of cellular localization, DISC1 is found in perinuclear punctate structures and extends into neurites, suggesting a role in intracellular transport and neuronal architecture (Morris2003DISC1). Its interactions with various proteins highlight its importance in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of neurons (Bradshaw2012DISC1binding).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DISC1 gene are linked to a variety of psychiatric disorders. DISC1 is associated with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, and autism spectrum disorders. Genetic studies have identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DISC1 that are associated with these conditions (Mao2009Disrupted). The gene's disruption, such as through chromosomal translocation, has been observed in a Scottish family with a high incidence of psychiatric disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Brandon2009Understanding).

Alterations in DISC1 expression levels have been noted in patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. For instance, certain DISC1 transcripts are elevated in the hippocampus of schizophrenia patients, while reduced levels are observed in bipolar disorder patients (Thomson2012DISC1). DISC1's interaction with proteins like PDE4B and GSK3β is crucial, as these interactions are implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and mood disorders (Lipina2014DisruptedInSchizophrenia1).

DISC1 also plays a role in mitochondrial function, and its dysfunction can lead to mitochondrial abnormalities, which are linked to neurological diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. These mitochondrial issues may contribute to the risk of psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (Thomson2012DISC1).

## Interactions
The DISC1 (Disrupted in Schizophrenia 1) protein is a multifunctional scaffold protein that interacts with a variety of proteins involved in intracellular signaling and structural organization. DISC1 interacts with centrosome-associated proteins and microtubule-related proteins, including MAP1A and MIPT3, which contribute to its microtubule association (Morris2003DISC1). It also interacts with NUDEL, a protein associated with the molecular motor protein cytoplasmic dynein, which is important for anterograde and retrograde transport. This interaction is crucial for DISC1's association with centrosomes and may affect neuronal migration and cortical development (Morris2003DISC1; Ozeki2002DisruptedinSchizophrenia1).

DISC1 also interacts with transcription factors ATF4 and ATF5, which are involved in signal transduction from the cell membrane to the nucleus. These interactions are mediated through the second C-terminal leucine zippers of ATF4 and ATF5 and are lost upon DISC1 truncation (Morris2003DISC1). DISC1's interaction with Ndel1/Nde1 is characterized by a specific binding mechanism, with DISC1 binding to the full-length Nde1 at a 1:1 stoichiometry with high affinity (Ye2017DISC1).

These interactions suggest that DISC1 plays a role in receptor transport, localization, and signal transduction, which may be disrupted in schizophrenia due to DISC1 truncation (Morris2003DISC1).
