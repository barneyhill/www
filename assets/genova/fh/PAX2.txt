# PAX2

## Overview
PAX2 is a gene that encodes the paired box 2 protein, a transcription factor belonging to the Pax family, which is characterized by a conserved paired domain essential for DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. The PAX2 protein plays a pivotal role in embryonic development, particularly in the formation of the urogenital system, eyes, and central nervous system. It functions by regulating gene expression through specific DNA interactions, influencing processes such as cell differentiation and proliferation. PAX2 is involved in critical developmental pathways, including those necessary for kidney and eye development, and is expressed in various tissues during both embryonic and adult stages. Mutations in the PAX2 gene are linked to several congenital disorders, including renal coloboma syndrome, which underscores its clinical significance in developmental biology and genetic medicine (Yang2021Phenotypic; Lang2007PAX; Chalepakis1993Pax:; Chang2022PAX2).

## Structure
The PAX2 protein is a member of the Paired box (Pax) family, characterized by a conserved paired domain, which is a DNA-binding motif essential for its function as a transcription factor in embryonic development (Yang2021Phenotypic; Chalepakis1993Pax:). The primary structure of PAX2 includes a sequence of amino acids that form distinct domains, such as the N-terminal paired domain and a C-terminal homeodomain, both of which are involved in DNA binding (Yang2021Phenotypic; Chalepakis1993Pax:). The paired domain is subdivided into two subdomains, PAI and RED, each containing helix-turn-helix motifs crucial for DNA interaction (Håvik1999A).

The secondary structure of PAX2 involves alpha helices, particularly within the paired domain, which facilitate its DNA-binding capabilities (Chalepakis1993Pax:). The tertiary structure of PAX2, although not fully detailed, involves the 3D folding of these domains to enable specific DNA interactions (Grimley2017Inhibition). PAX2 can form quaternary structures through interactions with other proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context.

PAX2 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that may have distinct functions (Goode2009The). These isoforms can affect the protein's transactivation potential and DNA-binding properties (Goode2009The). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may also play a role in regulating PAX2's activity, although specific modifications are not detailed in the context.

## Function
PAX2 is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the development of the urogenital system, eyes, and central nervous system. It is involved in the regulation of gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences, influencing cell differentiation and proliferation. In the developing kidney, PAX2 is expressed in ductal and mesenchymal cells during all stages, including the pro-, meso-, and metanephros, facilitating mesenchymal-epithelial transitions necessary for nephric duct formation (Lang2007PAX; Dressler1996Pax2). PAX2 also controls the expression of Wt1 and Gdnf, which are essential for metanephros initiation and development (Lang2007PAX).

In the central nervous system, PAX2 is involved in the formation of the midbrain-hindbrain boundary, regulating the expression of other Pax genes such as PAX5 and PAX8 through cross-regulatory feedback loops (Blake2014Pax). PAX2 is also active in the optic vesicle, optic disc, and optic nerve, contributing to eye development (Tellier2000Expression).

In adult tissues, PAX2 is expressed at low to moderate levels in organs such as the brain, pancreas, and kidney, where it plays a role in tissue repair and regeneration, particularly in the kidney after nephrotoxin damage (Lang2007PAX; Thompson2020Overview).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PAX2 gene are associated with several congenital and developmental disorders, most notably renal coloboma syndrome, also known as papillorenal syndrome. This autosomal dominant disorder is characterized by renal and ocular abnormalities, including renal hypodysplasia and optic nerve colobomas (Bower2012Update; GalvezRuiz2017Three). Renal hypodysplasia, a condition where the kidneys are underdeveloped, is a common manifestation and can lead to chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease (Rossanti2020Clinical; Chang2022PAX2). 

PAX2 mutations can also result in vesicoureteral reflux, cystic kidney disease, and other congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), which are significant causes of chronic kidney disease in pediatric patients (Chang2022PAX2; Harshman2011PAX2). In addition to renal and ocular issues, PAX2 mutations are linked to non-renal manifestations such as sensorineural hearing loss, developmental delays, and central nervous system malformations (GalvezRuiz2017Three; Chang2022PAX2).

The PAX2 gene's role in kidney development is critical, and its dysregulation can lead to a range of clinical presentations, highlighting the importance of genetic testing and early diagnosis for managing these disorders (Muntean2023PAX2; Chang2022PAX2).

## Interactions
PAX2 is known to interact with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in transcriptional regulation and developmental processes. One significant interaction is with the PTIP protein, which contains BRCT domains. PTIP links PAX2 to a histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase complex, facilitating the assembly of this complex at PAX2-binding DNA elements. This interaction is essential for the methylation of histone H3K4, a modification associated with active chromatin and gene expression (Patel2007The).

PAX2 also interacts with WT1, a protein involved in kidney and gonadal development. This interaction occurs both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a cooperative role in modifying phenotypes and potentially influencing developmental processes (Discenza2003WT1).

Additionally, PAX2 can bind to specific DNA sequences, such as the triple-A motif, through its paired domain. This binding is crucial for its role as a transcriptional repressor, influencing gene expression by interacting with these motifs (Håvik1999A).

PAX2's activity can be inhibited by small molecules like EG1, which targets its DNA binding domain, thereby affecting its transcriptional activation and related developmental processes (Grimley2017Inhibition).
