# EVPL

## Overview
The EVPL gene encodes the protein envoplakin, a member of the plakin family of cytolinker proteins, which are integral to the structural organization of epithelial cells. Envoplakin is characterized by its ability to form heterodimers with periplakin, facilitating its role in linking intermediate filaments to desmosomes, thereby contributing to cell-cell adhesion and tissue resilience (Karashima2002Interaction; Fogl2016Mechanism). This protein is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, where it plays a crucial role in the assembly and disassembly of junctional complexes, maintaining tissue integrity under mechanical stress (Fogl2016Mechanism). Envoplakin is also involved in the formation of the cornified envelope in epithelial cells, providing a scaffold for other proteins and contributing to the epidermal permeability barrier (Sevilla2007Mice; Fogl2016Mechanism). Alterations in the expression of the EVPL gene have been associated with various cancers, highlighting its potential as a molecular marker for early detection and prevention strategies (Sigurdson2016Selected; Hu2006Quantitative).

## Structure
Envoplakin (EVPL) is a member of the plakin family of cytolinker proteins, characterized by a distinct molecular structure. The primary structure of envoplakin includes an N-terminal globular domain, a central rod domain with heptad repeats, and a C-terminal globular domain (Karashima2002Interaction). The rod domain is crucial for the protein's ability to form aggregates and heterodimerize with periplakin, another plakin family member (Karashima2002Interaction). The C-terminal region of envoplakin contains a plakin repeat, which is involved in interactions with intermediate filaments, although it lacks the linker motif found in periplakin (Karashima2002Interaction).

The secondary structure of envoplakin features coiled-coil regions within the rod domain, facilitating its dimerization and interaction with other proteins. The tertiary structure involves interactions between the globular domains and the rod domain, contributing to the protein's stability and function. In terms of quaternary structure, envoplakin can form heterodimers with periplakin, which stabilizes its association with intermediate filaments (Karashima2002Interaction).

Envoplakin undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may regulate its interactions with other proteins, although specific details on these modifications are not fully determined (Karashima2002Interaction). The protein also has splice variant isoforms that may differ in function or localization.

## Function
Envoplakin, encoded by the EVPL gene, is a crucial component in the formation and function of the cornified envelope in epithelial cells. It plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity of cells by linking intermediate filaments to desmosomes, which are essential for cell-cell adhesion and tissue resilience (Karashima2002Interaction; Fogl2016Mechanism). Envoplakin contains a plakin repeat domain (PRD) that interacts with intermediate filaments like vimentin through electrostatic interactions, facilitated by basic residues in the PRD. This interaction is vital for cytoskeletal organization and remodeling, processes important for wound healing and epidermal differentiation (Fogl2016Mechanism).

Envoplakin, along with periplakin, forms a scaffold for other proteins in the cornified envelope, contributing to the epidermal permeability barrier (Fogl2016Mechanism). It is expressed in various epithelial tissues and is associated with desmosomes, suggesting a role in intercellular adhesion (Fogl2016Mechanism). The protein is active primarily in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the dynamic assembly and disassembly of junctional complexes in epithelial cells, maintaining tissue integrity under mechanical stress (Karashima2002Interaction; Fogl2016Mechanism).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the EVPL gene have been implicated in several cancers. In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), EVPL is significantly under-expressed in 67% of patients, suggesting its potential role as a molecular marker for early detection and prevention strategies in ESCC (Hu2006Quantitative). The gene's under-expression in ESCC indicates a possible disruption in maintaining an intact cell surface interface, which is crucial for cell adhesion and integrity (Hu2006Quantitative).

In thyroid cancers, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the EVPL gene have been associated with increased risk of papillary and differentiated thyroid cancers. These genetic variations suggest a potential role of EVPL in the development of these cancers (Sigurdson2016Selected).

EVPL is also implicated in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), where it is involved in the regulation of epidermis development and epithelial cell differentiation. Its mutation is linked to the tylosis esophageal cancer locus, indicating a possible role in OSCC tumorigenesis (Zhang2018Application).

Additionally, EVPL has been identified as a modifier impact variant in familial gastroschisis, a complex birth defect, suggesting its involvement in epithelium and epidermis development (Salinas‐Torres2020Whole).

## Interactions
Envoplakin (EVPL) is a protein that participates in various interactions crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of epithelial cells. It forms heterodimers with periplakin (PPL) through their rod domains, which is essential for their proper localization to subcellular structures such as desmosomes and intermediate filaments (Karashima2002Interaction). The C-terminus of EVPL contains a plakin repeat domain that interacts with intermediate filaments, including keratins and vimentin, although this interaction is enhanced in the presence of periplakin, suggesting that periplakin mediates EVPL's association with intermediate filaments (Karashima2002Interaction; Wesley2021The).

EVPL is also involved in the formation of the cornified envelope in the epidermis, where it forms a scaffold with periplakin and involucrin, contributing to the assembly and mechanical stability of the cornified cell envelope (Sevilla2007Mice; Bouameur2014Plakins). In zebrafish models, EVPL and PPL are shown to bind both F-actin and keratins, potentially linking these cytoskeletal filaments in microridges, which are important for microridge morphogenesis (Inaba2020Keratins). These interactions highlight the role of EVPL in cytoskeletal organization and epithelial cell integrity.
