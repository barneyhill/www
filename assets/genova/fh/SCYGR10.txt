# SCYGR10

## Overview
SCYGR10 is a gene that encodes the protein small cysteine and glycine repeat containing 10, which is characterized by its distinctive sequence of cysteine and glycine repeats. This protein is categorized as a pseudogene, indicating that it may not produce a functional protein product due to mutations or deletions that disrupt its normal function. The SCYGR10 gene is of interest in genomic studies due to its potential evolutionary significance and its role in genomic architecture. Although the precise biological function of the SCYGR10-encoded protein remains unclear, its structural features suggest a possible involvement in cellular processes that require cysteine-rich domains, which are often implicated in protein-protein interactions and cellular signaling pathways (Qiu2020aarFDC).
