# RBM22

## Overview
RBM22 is a gene that encodes the RNA binding motif protein 22, a crucial component in the regulation of RNA splicing and transcription processes in human cells. The protein is characterized by its zinc-binding and RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains, which facilitate its interaction with various spliceosomal components and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) (Zhang2017An). As a part of the spliceosome, RBM22 plays a significant role in pre-mRNA splicing by stabilizing the conformation of the spliceosomal catalytic core and interacting with U6 RNA and pre-mRNA (Rasche2012Cwc2). Beyond splicing, RBM22 is involved in transcription regulation, particularly in maintaining RNAPII elongation and termination, by interacting with complexes such as 7SK-P-TEFb and transcription elongation factors (Du2024RBM22). Its dysregulation is implicated in various cancers, where it influences apoptosis and tumor progression, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (FuentesFayos2020Splicing; Konishi2021The).

## Structure
RBM22 is a human protein involved in RNA splicing, characterized by distinct structural domains. The protein comprises an N-terminal zinc-binding domain and a C-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain. The N-terminal domain, spanning residues 19-221, has a globular fold and binds two zinc ions, featuring an extended loop (residues 162-186) homologous to yeast Cwc2, which also binds a zinc ion (Zhang2017An). The C-terminal RRM domain, covering residues 222-303, shares homology with yeast Cwc2 (Zhang2017An).

RBM22 is strategically positioned in the spliceosome, interacting with various RNA and protein components. The N-terminal domain interacts with the N-terminal loop sequences of proteins such as Cdc5, G10, SKIP, Prp17, and U6 snRNA, as well as intron sequences. The C-terminal domain binds proteins like PPIL1 and SKIP (Zhang2017An). The protein's structure facilitates the stabilization of intron binding through a positively charged central channel within the N-terminal domain (Zhang2017An).

RBM22 may undergo partial unfolding to allow intron binding or require intron binding for correct folding, indicating a dynamic structural role during splicing (Zhang2017An). The protein's evolutionary origin suggests it may have arisen from a fusion event between yeast proteins Cwc2 and Ecm2 (Zhang2018Structure).

## Function
RBM22 is a critical regulator of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcriptional processes in human cells. It plays a significant role in maintaining the rapid elongation of RNAPII across genes and is essential for proper transcription termination. RBM22 is highly occupied at RNAPII pausing sites downstream of the transcription end site (TES), indicating its involvement in RNAPII termination. The absence of RBM22 leads to enhanced transcriptional readthrough at many transcribed genes, as evidenced by increased readthrough index values in RBM22-depleted cells (Du2024RBM22).

RBM22 also regulates RNAPII pause release and elongation rate. It inhibits the release of RNAPII from pause sites at gene promoters, affecting the transcription process. Depletion of RBM22 results in a slower RNAPII transcription rate, with the average elongation rate decreasing significantly (Du2024RBM22). RBM22 achieves these regulatory functions by coordinating with the 7SK-P-TEFb complex and the elongation factor SPT5, stabilizing the inhibitory complex at promoters and facilitating pausing at promoters (Du2024RBM22).

RBM22's role extends beyond splicing, contributing to the regulation of RNAPII transcription and potentially influencing chromatin conformation near transcription start sites (Du2024RBM22). It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it ensures efficient transcription termination and maintains the speed of elongating RNAPII (Du2024RBM22).

## Clinical Significance
RBM22 is implicated in various cancers due to its role in pre-mRNA splicing and its interactions with other proteins. In colorectal and pancreatic cancers, RBM22 inhibits apoptosis, promoting cancer progression. Downregulation of RBM22 in these cancers increases cleaved PARP, a marker of apoptosis, suggesting its role in tumor survival (Konishi2021The). In glioblastoma, RBM22 is overexpressed, contributing to tumor aggressiveness by enhancing proliferation, migration, and resistance to apoptosis. Silencing RBM22 in glioblastoma cell lines reduces these aggressive traits, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (FuentesFayos2020Splicing).

RBM22's interaction with the calcium-binding protein ALG-2 suggests a role in Ca2+-dependent signaling, which may influence alternative splicing and cell division. This interaction is crucial for the nuclear translocation of ALG-2, potentially linking calcium signaling to essential cellular processes (Janowicz2011Stress; Montaville2006Nuclear). While the clinical significance of RBM22 gene mutations is not extensively detailed, its dysregulation and altered interactions are associated with cancer progression and may serve as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
RBM22 is a protein that plays a significant role in pre-mRNA splicing and transcription regulation through its interactions with various proteins and nucleic acids. It is a component of the NineTeen Related (NTR) complex and interacts with the spliceosomal catalytic core, stabilizing the conformation of the spliceosome (Soubise2022RBM22). RBM22 binds to U6 RNA and pre-mRNA within the spliceosome, with specific crosslinks identified in the B act and C complexes, indicating its role in splicing (Rasche2012Cwc2).

RBM22 interacts with the 7SK-P-TEFb complex, which is involved in transcription regulation. It stabilizes this complex at gene promoters, repressing the release of active P-TEFb and influencing RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) pause release (Du2024RBM22). RBM22 also interacts with transcription elongation factors such as P-TEFb, PAF1, and AFF4, and shows preferential binding to phosphorylated forms of RNAPII (Du2024RBM22).

In addition to its role in splicing, RBM22 interacts with the calcium-binding protein ALG-2, facilitating its nuclear translocation, which may influence calcium-dependent signaling and alternative splicing (Montaville2006Nuclear). These interactions highlight RBM22's multifaceted role in gene expression regulation.
