# FGF3

## Overview
Fibroblast growth factor 3 (FGF3) is a gene that encodes a member of the fibroblast growth factor family, which is involved in a wide array of biological processes, including embryonic development, cell growth, morphogenesis, tissue repair, and tumor growth. The protein product of FGF3, also known as fibroblast growth factor 3, is a signaling molecule that primarily functions in the extracellular space, where it binds to high-affinity tyrosine kinase receptors to activate various intracellular signaling pathways. These pathways, such as Ras/Raf-MEK-MAPKs and PI3K/AKT, are crucial for regulating cellular proliferation, differentiation, and survival (Xie2020FGF/FGFR). FGF3 plays a pivotal role in the development of skeletal structures and craniofacial features, as well as in the specification of neural crest cells and the anterior-posterior axis during embryogenesis (Xie2020FGF/FGFR). Mutations in the FGF3 gene are linked to several developmental disorders, including syndromic deafness and LAMM syndrome, highlighting its importance in auditory and craniofacial development (Riazuddin2011Variable; Tekin2007Homozygous).

## Function
FGF3 (fibroblast growth factor 3) is a protein that plays a significant role in embryonic development, particularly in the formation and patterning of skeletal structures. It is involved in the specification of neural crest cells and the extension of the anterior-posterior axis, working in conjunction with BMP signaling (Xie2020FGF/FGFR). FGF3 is also crucial in early developmental processes, such as the specification of the skull in zebrafish, indicating its importance in craniofacial development (Xie2020FGF/FGFR).

In cellular biology, FGF3 functions by binding to high-affinity tyrosine kinase receptors, triggering downstream signaling pathways like Ras/Raf-MEK-MAPKs, PI3K/AKT, and PLCγ, which regulate cellular proliferation, differentiation, and survival (Xie2020FGF/FGFR). These pathways are essential for various cellular processes, including lineage commitment and apoptosis regulation (Xie2020FGF/FGFR).

FGF3 is primarily active in the extracellular space, where it influences nearby cells through paracrine signaling. This localization is facilitated by coreceptors such as heparan sulfate proteoglycans, which help localize FGFs near their secretion sites (Xie2020FGF/FGFR). The regulation of FGF3 signaling is complex, involving spatial and temporal expression patterns, alternative splicing, and post-translational modifications (Xie2020FGF/FGFR).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FGF3 gene are associated with several developmental disorders, most notably a form of syndromic deafness characterized by inner ear agenesis, microtia, and microdontia. This condition is linked to homozygous mutations in FGF3, such as p.S156P, p.R104X, and p.V206SfsX117, which result in nonfunctional proteins and significant developmental abnormalities in the ear and teeth (Tekin2007Homozygous). 

FGF3 mutations are also implicated in LAMM syndrome, which includes complete labyrinthine aplasia, microtia, and microdontia. Specific mutations like p.R104X and p.R132GfsX26 are associated with fully penetrant LAMM syndrome, while the p.R95W mutation is linked to a milder phenotype with variable expressivity (Riazuddin2011Variable). 

Alterations in FGF3 expression have been suggested to contribute to hypodontia, a condition characterized by missing teeth. Genetic studies have found associations between FGF3 single nucleotide polymorphisms and hypodontia, indicating that variations in this gene may increase susceptibility to the condition (Vieira2013Candidate). 

These findings underscore the critical role of FGF3 in craniofacial and auditory development, with mutations leading to a spectrum of phenotypic outcomes.

## Interactions
Fibroblast growth factor 3 (FGF3) is known to interact with several proteins, influencing cellular processes such as cell proliferation and ribosomal biogenesis. One significant interaction is with ribosomal protein S2 (rpS2). This interaction was identified through a yeast two-hybrid screen and confirmed by various methods, including GST fusion protein assays and co-immunoprecipitation in COS-1 cells. The binding between FGF3 and rpS2 involves the Arg-Gly-rich N-terminal region and a short carboxyl-terminal sequence of rpS2, suggesting a robust interaction that may affect ribosomal assembly and cell proliferation (Antoine2005Fibroblast).

FGF3 also interacts with a nucleolar protein known as NoBP (nucleolar binding protein), which is involved in pre-rRNA processing. This interaction is crucial for FGF3's nucleolar localization and its inhibitory effects on cell proliferation. NoBP contains nuclear and nucleolar targeting motifs, and its expression is cell cycle-regulated, peaking during the late G1/early S phase. The binding of FGF3 to NoBP is essential for its nucleolar accumulation, and this interaction can counteract the growth-inhibitory effects of nuclear FGF3, promoting cell proliferation (Reimers2001NoBP).
