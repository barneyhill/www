# CCDC3

## Overview
The CCDC3 gene encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 3 protein, a secretory protein that plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including lipid metabolism, adipogenesis, and inflammation. This protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domain, which is essential for its structural and functional properties, and is highly conserved across species (Omari2023Extracellular). CCDC3 is predominantly expressed in adipose tissue and vascular endothelial cells, where it influences lipid accumulation and adipocyte differentiation, as well as exhibits anti-inflammatory properties by modulating the NF-κB signaling pathway (Azad2014Coiledcoil; Kobayashi2015FatVesselderived). Additionally, CCDC3 interacts with key proteins such as p53, playing a role in tumor suppression and cellular stress responses (Omari2023Extracellular). Its involvement in metabolic and cardiovascular health, as well as cancer, underscores its potential as a therapeutic target for various diseases (Omari2023Extracellular).

## Structure
The CCDC3 protein, encoded by the CCDC3 gene on human chromosome 10, consists of 270 amino acids and is highly conserved across species (Omari2023Extracellular). Its primary structure includes a secretory signal peptide at the N-terminus, which is cleaved during secretion (Kobayashi2010Identification). The secondary structure features a coiled-coil domain near the C-terminus, composed of 2-5 amphipathic α-helices that form a supercoil, crucial for molecular recognition and protein refolding (Omari2023Extracellular). 

The tertiary structure is influenced by intrinsic disorder domains, particularly in bovine CCDC3, which extend through the coiled-coil domain, allowing for structural flexibility (Omari2023Extracellular). The quaternary structure is characterized by its dimeric nature, with disulfide bonds linking the subunits (Kobayashi2010Identification). CCDC3 is N-glycosylated, with two consensus N-glycosylation sites, which are important for its secretory and structural roles (Omari2023Extracellular). 

The protein also contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS) at the C-terminus, overlapping with the coiled-coil and intrinsic disorder domains, indicating its nuclear functions (Omari2023Extracellular). Some domains, such as DUF881 and SMC_prok_A, are conserved in more primitive species, suggesting evolutionary adaptation for diverse functions (Omari2023Extracellular).

## Function
The CCDC3 gene encodes a secretory protein that plays a significant role in lipid metabolism and adipogenesis. It is highly expressed in adipose tissue and vascular endothelial cells, where it influences lipid accumulation and adipocyte differentiation. In adipocytes, CCDC3 promotes the expression of lipogenic genes such as fatty-acid synthase (FAS), acetyl-CoA carboxylase α (ACC1), and diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase-2 (Dgat2), facilitating lipid accumulation and adipogenesis (Kobayashi2015FatVesselderived). 

CCDC3 also exhibits anti-inflammatory properties in endothelial cells by inhibiting TNF-α-induced expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), which is mediated through the suppression of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation (azad2015investigating; Azad2014Coiledcoil). This suggests a protective role against endothelial inflammation, potentially impacting cardiovascular health.

In the liver, CCDC3 is involved in reducing de novo lipogenesis, thereby alleviating glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis, particularly under high-fat diet conditions (Liao2017Ccdc3:). The protein's activity in these processes highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic disorders.

## Clinical Significance
The CCDC3 gene is clinically significant due to its involvement in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression or interactions. In the context of cardiovascular health, CCDC3 plays a role in atherosclerosis by modulating inflammation and immunity. It is involved in a negative feedback loop with TNF-α, where its overexpression suppresses TNF-α, reducing the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), which is linked to atherosclerosis. CCDC3 deficiency is associated with decreased expression of MEF2C and its downstream targets, which are crucial for cardiovascular regulation and atherosclerosis prevention (Omari2023Extracellular).

In cancer, particularly breast cancer, CCDC3 acts as a tumor suppressor by stabilizing p53, preventing its degradation, and inhibiting tumor growth. Reduced expression of CCDC3 in breast cancer is associated with poorer survival outcomes, highlighting its potential role in cancer prognosis (Omari2023Extracellular).

CCDC3 is also implicated in metabolic disorders. Its expression correlates with body mass index and waist circumference, suggesting a role in obesity. Overexpression in adipocytes increases adipocyte differentiation and lipogenic gene expression, while CCDC3 knockout mice exhibit a leaner phenotype, indicating its involvement in lipid metabolism and obesity (Omari2023Extracellular).

## Interactions
CCDC3 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. In breast cancer cells, CCDC3 interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53. It binds to the C-terminus of p53, preventing its degradation by inhibiting the association of p53 with the proteasome, which is mediated by MDM2. Although CCDC3 enhances MDM2-mediated ubiquitination of p53, it prevents p53 degradation through a post-ubiquitination mechanism. This interaction is crucial as CCDC3 binds to the C-terminus of MDM2, which is involved in recruiting ubiquitinated p53 to the proteasome (Omari2023Extracellular).

CCDC3 is also involved in a feedback loop with p53, as p53 can induce the expression of CCDC3 in breast cancer cells. This is supported by evidence showing that p53 binds to p53-responsive DNA elements at the CCDC3 gene promoter, suggesting a feedback loop where CCDC3 can help recruit p53 to its own promoter region (Omari2023Extracellular).

In endothelial cells, CCDC3 inhibits TNF-α-induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB components p50 and p65, which are transcription factors. This suggests that CCDC3 may interact with components of the NF-κB signaling pathway to exert its inhibitory effects (Azad2014Coiledcoil).
