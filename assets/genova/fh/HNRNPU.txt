# HNRNPU

## Overview
The HNRNPU gene encodes the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U, a multifunctional protein predominantly located in the nucleus, where it plays a pivotal role in RNA processing and chromatin organization. As a member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family, hnRNP U is involved in the formation of hnRNP complexes essential for pre-mRNA processing and splicing (Kiledjian1992Primary). The protein is characterized by its ability to bind RNA and single-stranded DNA, influencing RNA stability and transport (Geuens2016The). Additionally, hnRNP U is crucial for maintaining the three-dimensional architecture of the genome by binding to scaffold/matrix attachment region (S/MAR) DNA elements, thereby contributing to chromatin loop formation and gene expression regulation (Göhring1997The; Zhang2019The). Its involvement in X chromosome inactivation, through the localization of Xist RNA, underscores its significance in gene silencing and dosage compensation (Hasegawa2010The). Mutations in HNRNPU are linked to various neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its importance in cellular homeostasis and organismal development.

## Structure
The HNRNPU gene encodes the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U, a protein primarily located in the nucleus and involved in RNA processing and regulation. The protein is characterized by several distinct domains, including an RNA-binding domain known as the RGG box, located in the glycine-rich C-terminus, which facilitates its interaction with RNA and single-stranded DNA (Geuens2016The; Ye2015hnRNP). The N-terminus of hnRNP U is rich in acidic residues and contains sequences that allow binding to scaffold/matrix attachment region (S/MAR) elements, independent of the RNA-binding domain (Roshon2005Hypomorphic).

The protein also features a nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence in the middle, which is crucial for its nuclear import (Geuens2016The). Post-translational modifications, such as methylation by Prmt1, occur on hnRNP U, although this modification is constitutive and does not regulate its functions under steady-state conditions (Roshon2005Hypomorphic). The protein's structure includes a glycine-rich domain, which contributes to its functional diversity and ability to participate in various cellular processes, including splicing and mRNA stability (Geuens2016The). The hnRNP U protein is essential for embryonic development, as evidenced by severe developmental retardation in mice with reduced expression of hnRNP U (Roshon2005Hypomorphic).

## Function
HNRNPU, also known as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U, is a multifunctional protein primarily located in the nucleus, where it plays a critical role in RNA processing and chromatin organization. It is involved in the formation of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) complexes, which are essential for pre-mRNA processing and splicing (Kiledjian1992Primary). HNRNPU binds to pre-mRNA and single-stranded DNA, influencing RNA stability and transport (Geuens2016The).

HNRNPU is also a key player in maintaining the three-dimensional architecture of the genome. It binds to scaffold/matrix attachment region (S/MAR) DNA elements, contributing to higher-order chromatin structure and chromatin loop formation, which are crucial for gene expression regulation (Göhring1997The; Zhang2019The). The protein interacts with chromatin-associated RNAs and transcription factors, facilitating transcription initiation and elongation (Zhang2019The).

In the context of X chromosome inactivation, HNRNPU is essential for the localization of Xist RNA on the X chromosome, a process necessary for gene silencing and dosage compensation in female cells (Hasegawa2010The). Its role in chromatin organization and RNA processing underscores its importance in cellular homeostasis and organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HNRNPU gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, including HNRNPU-related neurodevelopmental disorder (HNRNPU-NDD) and developmental and epileptic encephalopathy-54 (DEE54). These conditions are characterized by intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, early-onset seizures, and developmental delays (Lee2023Germline; Dreikorn2024Case). HNRNPU mutations often result in a loss-of-function effect, leading to severe phenotypes such as microcephaly, ventriculomegaly, and dysmorphic facial features (Lee2023Germline; Depienne2017Genetic).

The gene is also implicated in 1q43-q44 microdeletion syndrome, where deletions including HNRNPU are strongly associated with epilepsy. Patients with these deletions frequently experience seizures, with onset typically around 13.5 months, and exhibit severe developmental and speech delays (Depienne2017Genetic). HNRNPU haploinsufficiency is considered a primary cause of epilepsy in these cases (Depienne2017Genetic).

Alterations in HNRNPU expression can disrupt RNA splicing and chromatin organization, affecting genes involved in cell survival and synapse formation. This disruption can lead to rapid cell death in neural progenitors and postmitotic neurons, contributing to the pathogenesis of these disorders (Sapir2022Heterogeneous).

## Interactions
HNRNPU, also known as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for its function in RNA processing and chromatin organization. It is a component of supramolecular complexes with other hnRNP proteins, as evidenced by co-immunopurification with antibodies to other hnRNP proteins (Kiledjian1992Primary). HNRNPU interacts with chromatin-associated proteins such as CTCF and RAD21, playing a role in the organization of higher-order chromatin structures, including chromatin loops and topologically associating domains (TADs) (Zhang2019The). It also forms complexes with actin and DNA topoisomerase IIβ, which regulate transcription initiation (Zhang2019The).

HNRNPU binds to specific DNA elements and scaffold/matrix attachment regions, contributing to chromatin decompaction and the recruitment of XIST RNA on the inactive X chromosome (Zhang2019The). It interacts with long noncoding RNAs, such as SFTA1P, and microRNAs like miR-30c-5p, stabilizing them and affecting their nuclear retention and export (Zietzer2020The). HNRNPU also binds to the 3'-UTR of mRNAs, such as IL-6 and TNFα, stabilizing them and regulating their expression (Yugami2020Analysis). These interactions highlight HNRNPU's multifaceted role in gene expression regulation and chromatin organization.
