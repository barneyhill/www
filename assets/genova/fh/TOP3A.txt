# TOP3A

## Overview
The TOP3A gene encodes the enzyme DNA topoisomerase III alpha, a crucial component in the maintenance of genomic and mitochondrial DNA integrity. As a member of the topoisomerase family, this enzyme plays a pivotal role in resolving DNA supercoiling and entanglements that occur during DNA replication and recombination. DNA topoisomerase III alpha is integral to the BTR dissolvasome complex, collaborating with other proteins to process homologous recombination intermediates and prevent genetic crossovers, thereby ensuring genomic stability (Saha2023Replicationassociated; Nicholls2018Topoisomerase). In mitochondria, it is essential for the decatenation of replicated mitochondrial DNA, preventing the accumulation of catenated mtDNA and ensuring proper replication fork progression (Menger2022Two). Mutations in the TOP3A gene are linked to disorders resembling Bloom syndrome, characterized by genomic instability and developmental abnormalities, underscoring the gene's clinical significance (Martin2018Mutations; Martin2024Mutations).

## Function
The TOP3A gene encodes DNA topoisomerase III alpha, an enzyme crucial for maintaining genomic stability in healthy human cells. This enzyme is involved in resolving DNA supercoiling and entanglements during replication and recombination, facilitating the separation of intertwined DNA strands. It plays a significant role in DNA replication by associating with replication forks, where it helps resolve topological stress and entanglements, ensuring proper replication fork progression and speed (Saha2023Replicationassociated). TOP3A is part of the BTR dissolvasome complex, working with Bloom helicase and RecQ-Mediated genome Instability proteins to process homologous recombination intermediates and prevent genetic crossovers (Saha2023Replicationassociated).

In mitochondria, TOP3A is essential for the decatenation of replicated mitochondrial DNA, preventing the accumulation of catenated mtDNA replication products and ensuring proper replication fork progression (Menger2022Two). It also contributes to mitochondrial transcription by maintaining processivity and preventing the formation of toxic recombination intermediates (Menger2022Two). The enzyme's activity is crucial for sister chromatid separation during mitosis and preventing DNA damage, highlighting its importance in cellular function and genome integrity (Martin2018Mutations; Saha2023Replicationassociated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TOP3A gene, which encodes DNA topoisomerase III alpha, are associated with a Bloom syndrome-like disorder. This condition is characterized by prenatal-onset growth restriction, microcephaly, and significantly reduced postnatal growth parameters. Individuals with these mutations often exhibit increased sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs), indicating excessive crossover recombination and genomic instability (Martin2018Mutations; Martin2024Mutations). The mutations typically result in nonsense-mediated decay of TOP3A transcripts, leading to a loss of the TopIIIa protein. Some specific mutations, such as a homozygous frameshift mutation, result in a protein lacking the C-terminal zinc-finger domain, affecting its stability and function (Martin2024Mutations).

In addition to growth and developmental issues, some individuals with TOP3A mutations present with cardiomyopathy, which may be linked to mitochondrial dysfunction. This aligns with the role of Top3a in mitochondrial DNA decatenation, as its absence can lead to catenated mtDNA species and mtDNA instability (Martin2018Mutations; Nicholls2018Topoisomerase). Pathogenic variants in TOP3A are also associated with adult-onset mitochondrial diseases, such as progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO), due to mtDNA deletions and rearrangements (Nicholls2018Topoisomerase).

## Interactions
TOP3A (DNA topoisomerase III alpha) is involved in several critical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It forms part of the BTR complex, which includes the Bloom helicase (BLM) and the RecQ-mediated genome instability proteins RMI1 and RMI2. This complex is essential for processing homologous recombination intermediates and preventing genetic crossovers (Martin2018Mutations; Saha2022Replicationassociated). In the nucleus, TOP3A works with these proteins to resolve double-Holliday junctions, a key step in maintaining genome stability (Nicholls2018Topoisomerase).

TOP3A also interacts with other helicases, such as FANCM, to suppress sister chromatid exchanges and restart replication. It collaborates with the Polo kinase 1-interacting checkpoint helicase (PICH) to induce positive DNA supercoiling (Saha2022Replicationassociated). In mitochondria, TOP3A operates independently of the BTR complex, suggesting unique mitochondrial cofactors or independent function (Nicholls2018Topoisomerase).

The repair of TOP3A cleavage complexes (TOP3Accs) involves interactions with the metalloprotease Spartan (SPRTN) and the tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase TDP2, which are crucial for removing DNA-protein crosslinks and 5′-topoisomerase adducts, respectively (Saha2022Replicationassociated). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of TOP3A in maintaining genomic and mitochondrial DNA integrity.
