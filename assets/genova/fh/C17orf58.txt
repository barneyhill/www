# C17orf58

## Overview
C17orf58 is a gene located on chromosome 17 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 17 open reading frame 58. This protein is currently uncharacterized, meaning its specific biological functions and mechanisms of action are not fully understood (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Research has suggested that C17orf58 may play a role in various cellular processes, including those related to cancer and immune response, as it is associated with the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and immune cell infiltration in tumors (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Additionally, genetic variations in C17orf58 have been linked to conditions such as primary biliary cirrhosis and chronic dizziness in the elderly, indicating its potential involvement in disease pathogenesis and aging (Selmi2014GenomeWide; Clifford2023GenomeWide). Further studies are needed to elucidate the precise functions and clinical implications of this gene and its encoded protein.

## Clinical Significance
C17orf58, located on chromosome 17, has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression and genetic variations. In the context of cancer, C17orf58 expression is associated with the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell growth and survival, particularly in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBC) and thymoma (THYM) (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). The gene's expression levels also correlate with immune cell infiltration in tumors, potentially influencing tumor progression and response to therapy (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

In primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), a genome-wide analysis identified copy number variations (CNVs) in C17orf58 present only in the affected twin of a discordant monozygotic twin pair, suggesting a potential link between these CNVs and the development of PBC (Selmi2014GenomeWide).

C17orf58 has also been explored in the context of chronic dizziness in the elderly, where it is associated with the longevity-promoting transcription factor GATA2, affecting extracellular matrix modeling. This suggests a possible role in aging or age-related conditions, although specific diseases are not explicitly tied to this gene (Clifford2023GenomeWide). Despite these associations, the specific clinical significance of C17orf58 mutations or expression alterations remains under investigation.
