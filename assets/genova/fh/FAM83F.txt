# FAM83F

## Overview
FAM83F is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 83, specifically member F. This protein is characterized by a conserved DUF1669 domain, which includes a pseudo-phospholipase D (PLD) domain, although it lacks enzymatic activity. FAM83F is unique within its family for being membrane-targeted, a feature facilitated by a protein prenylation motif at its C-terminus. This membrane localization is crucial for its role in the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, where it interacts with casein kinase 1 alpha (CK1α) to regulate cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation. Additionally, FAM83F is involved in stabilizing the tumor suppressor protein p53, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in oncogenic processes (Fuziwara2019The; Dunbar2020FAM83F).

## Structure
The FAM83F protein is characterized by a conserved DUF1669 domain located at the N-terminus, which is crucial for its function. This domain contains a pseudo-phospholipase D (PLD) domain, although it lacks enzymatic activity due to the absence of a critical histidine residue (Jones2024Zebrafish; Fuziwara2019The). The DUF1669 domain is involved in interactions with CK1α, mediated by a conserved F-X-X-X-F motif, where phenylalanine residues are essential for binding (Dunbar2020FAM83F). 

FAM83F also contains a protein prenylation motif, a CAAX box sequence at the C terminus, which undergoes farnesylation. This post-translational modification is important for its membrane localization, although it is not required for Wnt signaling activation (Dunbar2020FAM83F). The protein is the only member of the FAM83 family that is membrane-targeted, playing a role in canonical Wnt signaling and p53 stabilization (Jones2024Zebrafish). 

The C-terminal region of FAM83F is important for its structural integrity and function, as deletions in this region reduce its ability to induce secondary axes (Dunbar2020FAM83F). However, detailed information on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of FAM83F is not provided in the available sources.

## Function
The FAM83F gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is essential for various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and tissue homeostasis. FAM83F functions by interacting with casein kinase 1 alpha (CK1α) at the plasma membrane, a process that is crucial for the proper localization and function of CK1α in Wnt signaling. This interaction is mediated by the conserved DUF1669 domain of FAM83F, which facilitates the recruitment of CK1α to the plasma membrane, acting upstream of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) (Dunbar2020FAM83F).

FAM83F is farnesylated, a modification necessary for its membrane localization, which is vital for its role in Wnt signaling. The protein's presence at the plasma membrane is essential for directing CK1α to this location, thereby regulating the phosphorylation and degradation of β-catenin, a key component of the Wnt pathway (Dunbar2020FAM83F). In healthy human cells, FAM83F's activity is primarily observed in gastrointestinal tissues, where it supports cellular homeostasis by modulating Wnt signaling (Dunbar2020FAM83F). The protein's role in stabilizing p53 by reducing its ubiquitination and degradation further underscores its importance in maintaining cellular function (Dunbar2020FAM83F).

## Interactions
FAM83F interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in various signaling pathways. It has been shown to interact with components of the MAPK signaling pathway, specifically BRAF and RAF1, through immunoprecipitation assays in PCCL3-FAM83F cells. These interactions suggest FAM83F's involvement in the activation of MAPK/ERK signaling, which regulates cell proliferation and differentiation (Fuziwara2019The).

FAM83F also interacts with CK1α, a member of the CK1 family of Ser/Thr protein kinases. This interaction is crucial for FAM83F's role in regulating canonical Wnt signaling. FAM83F is farnesylated and co-localizes with CK1α at the plasma membrane, which is essential for activating Wnt signaling. Mutations in FAM83F that disrupt its interaction with CK1α result in altered cellular localization and reduced Wnt signaling activity (Dunbar2020FAM83F).

Additionally, FAM83F interacts with the RNA-binding protein HuR (ELAVL1), which is involved in RNA stability and transport. This interaction was observed in both rat and human thyroid follicular cells when FAM83F is overexpressed (Fuziwara2019The). These interactions highlight FAM83F's role in modulating signaling pathways and its potential involvement in oncogenic processes.
