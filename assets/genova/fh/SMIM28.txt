# SMIM28

## Overview
SMIM28, or small integral membrane protein 28, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes. The protein is characterized by its integration into cellular membranes, suggesting a role in membrane-associated functions. Although the precise biological functions of SMIM28 are not fully elucidated, it has been implicated in the pathogenesis of certain cancers, including neuroblastoma and prostate cancer. The gene's expression levels have been associated with tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker in oncology (Giwa2020Identification). Further research is necessary to understand the molecular mechanisms and pathways through which SMIM28 contributes to cancer biology.

## Clinical Significance
SMIM28 has been identified as a gene with clinical significance in the context of neuroblastoma, a type of cancer that primarily affects children. Research indicates that SMIM28 is upregulated in high-risk neuroblastoma patients with short survival times, suggesting its role as a prognostic marker for poor outcomes in this disease (Giwa2020Identification). The gene is part of a regulatory network associated with aggressive tumor behavior and poor prognosis, alongside other genes such as LGR5 and HOXD10, which are linked to cancer cell proliferation and tumor aggressiveness (Giwa2020Identification).

Although SMIM28 is less studied compared to other genes, its upregulation has also been reported in prostate cancer, indicating a potential broader role in cancer biology (Giwa2020Identification). The gene's involvement in these cancers suggests that alterations in its expression may contribute to tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Functional studies are recommended to further elucidate the specific mechanisms by which SMIM28 influences cancer development and progression (Giwa2020Identification). Despite its potential significance, the exact pathways and interactions through which SMIM28 affects disease states remain to be fully understood.
