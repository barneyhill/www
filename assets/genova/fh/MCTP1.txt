# MCTP1

## Overview
MCTP1, or multiple C2 and transmembrane domain containing 1, is a gene that encodes a protein characterized by its unique structure, which includes three C2 domains and two transmembrane regions. This protein is primarily involved in calcium signaling and synaptic function, acting as an endoplasmic reticulum-resident calcium sensor. It plays a crucial role in synaptic transmission and homeostatic plasticity, particularly in stabilizing synaptic transmission by promoting the release of synaptic vesicles (Genç2017MCTP). MCTP1 is expressed in various tissues, including skeletal muscle and the heart, and is implicated in several physiological and pathological processes, such as neurotransmitter release and cancer progression (Liu2022MCTP1; Shin2005Evolutionarily). The protein's interactions and regulatory mechanisms, particularly in the context of cancer, highlight its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions (Kong2020The; Liu2022MCTP1).

## Structure
The MCTP1 protein is characterized by its molecular structure, which includes three C2 domains (C2A, C2B, and C2C) and two transmembrane regions. These C2 domains are known for their calcium-binding properties, although the C2B domain of MCTP1 is less likely to bind calcium due to the absence of typical calcium-binding residues (Shin2005Evolutionarily). The C2 domains are composed of eight antiparallel β-strands, a common structural motif in proteins involved in calcium signaling (TéllezArreola2020MCTP1). The transmembrane regions anchor the protein to intracellular vesicles, suggesting a role in membrane-associated processes (Shin2005Evolutionarily).

Alternative splicing of the MCTP1 gene results in multiple isoforms, which can lead to variations in the protein's structure and function (Shin2005Evolutionarily). The primary structure of MCTP1 includes a variable N-terminal sequence, which contributes to the diversity of its isoforms (Shin2005Evolutionarily). The protein's secondary and tertiary structures are influenced by the arrangement of its C2 domains and transmembrane regions, which are evolutionarily conserved across species (Shin2005Evolutionarily). The presence of conserved residues in the C2 domains suggests potential roles in calcium and phospholipid interactions, although MCTP1 does not exhibit significant phospholipid binding (Shin2005Evolutionarily).

## Function
MCTP1 is a protein that functions as an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident calcium sensor, playing a crucial role in synaptic transmission and homeostatic plasticity. It is involved in stabilizing synaptic transmission by promoting the release of synaptic vesicles and is essential for presynaptic homeostatic plasticity (PHP) (Genç2017MCTP). MCTP1 is enriched on ER membranes within the soma, dendrites, axon, and presynaptic nerve terminal, indicating its involvement in calcium signaling and synaptic function (Genç2017MCTP).

The protein contains multiple C2 domains, which are typically involved in calcium binding, although MCTP1's C2 domains do not exhibit significant Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding, suggesting a unique role in calcium sensing (Shin2005Evolutionarily). MCTP1 is implicated in the regulation of neurotransmitter release, affecting behaviors such as egg-laying and mechanosensation in model organisms like C. elegans (TéllezArreola2020MCTP1).

In humans, MCTP1 is primarily expressed in skeletal muscle and to a lesser extent in the heart, indicating its potential role in muscle function and possibly in the central nervous system (Shin2005Evolutionarily). The protein's precise function in human cells remains an area of active research.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MCTP1 gene have been implicated in several cancers. In prostate cancer, MCTP1 is upregulated in response to androgen deprivation therapy and hypoxia, contributing to neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). These processes are critical in the progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer and neuroendocrine prostate cancer, with MCTP1 enhancing the calcium/AKT pathway to stabilize SNAI1, promoting EMT and NED (Liu2022MCTP1). 

In esophageal cancer, MCTP1 is hypermethylated in drug-resistant cells, leading to its down-regulation. This down-regulation affects cell proliferation and apoptosis, suggesting a role in drug resistance. Alterations in MCTP1 expression, particularly through methylation, could have clinical significance in understanding and potentially overcoming drug resistance in cancer treatment (Kong2020The).

In juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), circMCTP1, a circular RNA derived from the MCTP1 gene, is significantly upregulated. This upregulation is linked to tumor suppressor miRNAs, suggesting that circMCTP1 may play a role in the regulatory networks associated with JMML (Dal2021CircRNAs).

## Interactions
MCTP1 is involved in several interactions that are significant in the context of prostate cancer. It is regulated by a complex of transcription factors, including ZBTB46, FOXA2, and HIF1A, which bind directly to its regulatory sequences to enhance its transcription. This interaction is particularly prominent under hypoxic conditions, where the ZBTB46/FOXA2/HIF1A complex promotes MCTP1 expression, suggesting a feedback loop that enhances its transcriptional activation (Liu2022MCTP1).

MCTP1 also plays a role in the stabilization of the transcription factor SNAI1, which is crucial for neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in prostate cancer. This stabilization is mediated through a calcium/AKT signaling pathway, which is activated by MCTP1, leading to increased expression of EMT and neuroendocrine markers (Liu2022MCTP1).

These interactions highlight MCTP1's role in cancer progression, particularly in enhancing cell migration, invasion, and proliferation in prostate cancer cells, both androgen receptor-positive and negative (Liu2022MCTP1).
