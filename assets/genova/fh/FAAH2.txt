# FAAH2

## Overview
FAAH2, or fatty acid amide hydrolase 2, is a gene that encodes an enzyme involved in the metabolism of endocannabinoids, which are critical signaling molecules in various physiological processes. The enzyme, categorized as a hydrolase, is responsible for the hydrolysis of fatty acid amides, such as anandamide and palmitoylethanolamide, into free fatty acids and ethanolamine. This enzymatic activity is crucial for regulating endocannabinoid levels, thereby influencing neurological and psychiatric functions (Ueda2013Metabolism; Sirrs2015Defects). FAAH2 is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it plays a significant role in maintaining normal endocannabinoid signaling, which is essential for processes related to mood, pain, and inflammation (Ueda2013Metabolism). Mutations in the FAAH2 gene have been linked to various neurological and psychiatric conditions, underscoring its clinical significance (Sirrs2015Defects; Shamseldin2021Lethal).

## Function
FAAH2 (fatty acid amide hydrolase 2) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the metabolism of endocannabinoids, which are signaling molecules involved in various physiological processes. In healthy human cells, FAAH2 is responsible for the hydrolysis of fatty acid amides such as anandamide (AEA) and palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), converting them into free fatty acids and ethanolamine. This process is essential for regulating the levels and activity of endocannabinoids, which bind to cannabinoid receptors and influence neurological and psychiatric functions (Sirrs2015Defects).

FAAH2 is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum of cells, where it contributes to the degradation of these signaling molecules, thereby maintaining normal endocannabinoid signaling. This regulation is important for various cellular processes, including those related to mood, pain, and inflammation (Ueda2013Metabolism). The enzyme's activity is critical for maintaining normal physiological functions, and alterations in FAAH2 activity have been linked to neurological and psychiatric conditions (Sirrs2015Defects). The alanine residue at position 458 (p.Ala458) is particularly important for FAAH2's catalytic activity, and mutations at this site can significantly reduce the enzyme's ability to hydrolyze endocannabinoids (Sirrs2015Defects).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FAAH2 gene have been associated with a range of neurological and psychiatric conditions. A study identified a missense mutation, c.1372G > T (p.Ala458Ser), in a male patient, which resulted in partial inactivation of the FAAH2 enzyme. This mutation was linked to symptoms such as autistic features, anxiety, pseudoseizures, ataxia, supranuclear gaze palsy, and isolated learning disabilities. The study suggests that genetic alterations in FAAH2 activity may contribute to these disorders, highlighting its potential role in X-linked intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders (Sirrs2015Defects).

Another case involved a patient with a classical Zellweger syndrome phenotype, who was hemizygous for a variant in FAAH2: NM_174912.3:c.1175G>A:p.(Trp392*). This variant was inherited from the mother, suggesting an X-linked recessive inheritance pattern. The patient exhibited symptoms such as global developmental delay, seizure disorder, and severe hypotonia (Shamseldin2021Lethal).

Research on zebrafish has also indicated that the FAAH2 gene, specifically its homolog faah2a, plays a role in modulating stress-associated behavior, suggesting potential implications for stress-related disorders in humans (Krug2018The).
