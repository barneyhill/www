# SEPTIN8

## Overview
SEPTIN8 is a gene that encodes the protein septin 8, a member of the septin family of cytoskeletal GTPases. These proteins are integral to various cellular processes, including the maintenance of cellular structure and integrity. Septin 8 is characterized by its ability to bind GTP and form filamentous structures, playing a crucial role in cellular scaffolding and organization. It is particularly noted for its involvement in the structural integrity of cilia and endocytic vesicle trafficking, especially in kidney cells (Keele2021Sept8SEPTIN8). The protein is part of the SEPT6 subgroup, which lacks catalytic activity but is essential for stabilizing septin oligomers (Dolat2013Septin). SEPTIN8's interactions with other proteins, such as CAPS1 and HMGB1, suggest its involvement in vesicle fusion and RNA metabolic processes, respectively (Hosono2016Interaction; BarreiroAlonso2021HMGB1). Clinically, SEPTIN8 is implicated in kidney-related conditions, including chronic kidney disease and fibrosis, where its expression is upregulated in response to hypoxic stress (Keele2021Sept8SEPTIN8).

## Structure
SEPTIN8 is a member of the septin family, characterized by its ability to bind GTP and form filamentous structures. The primary structure of SEPTIN8 includes a conserved GTPase domain, which is crucial for its function in filament stabilization and assembly (Valadares2017Septin). The secondary structure of SEPTIN8 typically comprises alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its ability to form coiled-coil structures (Leonardo2021Orientational).

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a three-dimensional shape, allowing SEPTIN8 to interact with other proteins and cellular components. SEPTIN8's C-terminal domain is capable of forming coiled coils, which are essential for its role in filament formation and bundling (Leonardo2021Orientational). These coiled coils can adopt both parallel and antiparallel orientations, stabilized by a mixed hydrophobic/hydrophilic interface (Leonardo2021Orientational).

In terms of quaternary structure, SEPTIN8 often forms hetero-oligomeric complexes with other septins, such as those in the SEPT6 subgroup, which includes SEPT6, SEPT10, SEPT11, and SEPT14 (Valadares2017Septin). SEPTIN8 is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may regulate its function and interactions (Valadares2017Septin). Splice variant isoforms of SEPTIN8 may exist, contributing to its functional diversity (Valadares2017Septin).

## Function
SEPTIN8 is a member of the septin family of cytoskeletal GTPases, which are involved in various cellular processes, including maintaining cellular structure and integrity. In healthy human cells, SEPTIN8 is localized on the apical surface of proximal tubules in the kidneys, where it co-localizes with acetyl-alpha tubulin, indicating its presence in cilia. This suggests a role in maintaining the structural integrity of cilia and possibly in endocytic vesicle trafficking at the apical surface (Keele2021Sept8SEPTIN8).

Under normal conditions, SEPTIN8 is thought to contribute to cellular organization by forming part of the cytoskeletal framework. It is involved in the assembly of higher-order oligomers and filamentous structures, which are crucial for cellular scaffolding and organization (Dolat2013Septin). SEPTIN8 is part of the SEPT6 group, which is characterized by a lack of catalytic activity and a constant binding to GTP, potentially stabilizing septin oligomers (Dolat2013Septin).

While the specific functions of SEPTIN8 in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, its involvement in cellular structure and response to stress, particularly in the context of kidney function, is highlighted in various studies (Keele2021Sept8SEPTIN8).

## Clinical Significance
SEPTIN8 has been implicated in various kidney-related conditions, particularly in the context of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and fibrosis. Studies have shown that SEPTIN8 expression increases significantly in response to hypoxia-induced damage in kidney cells, suggesting its involvement in maintaining structural integrity and responding to cellular stress (Keele2021Sept8SEPTIN8). In rat models, increased SEPTIN8 expression is associated with higher urinary protein levels, indicating a potential link to kidney injury (Keele2021Sept8SEPTIN8). A specific variant within SEPTIN8, the V102M mutation, has been identified as potentially having a functional role in renal injury, affecting the hydrophobic core near SEPTIN8 dimer contacts (Keele2021Sept8SEPTIN8).

SEPTIN8 is also involved in cytoskeletal changes and may contribute to fibrosis, a condition marked by excess extracellular matrix protein and cytoskeletal rearrangement (Keele2021Sept8SEPTIN8). The gene's interaction with mitogen-activated protein kinase 5 (MK5) is linked to cellular stress and hypoxia-induced cell migration, further supporting its role in stress response and fibrosis (Keele2021Sept8SEPTIN8). While SEPTIN8's role in other diseases is not detailed, its involvement in kidney damage and fibrosis highlights its clinical significance.

## Interactions
SEPTIN8 is involved in various protein interactions that contribute to its role in cellular structure and function. In the mouse brain, SEPTIN8 interacts with CAPS1 (Ca2+-dependent activator protein for secretion 1), which is involved in vesicle fusion events. This interaction is part of a broader interaction between CAPS1 and several septin proteins, including septins 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8-11, suggesting a role in SNARE-mediated exocytosis (Hosono2016Interaction).

In the context of kidney damage, SEPTIN8 expression increases under hypoxic conditions, where it relocalizes near actin filaments, indicating a role in cytoskeletal reorganization and cellular response to stress (Keele2021Sept8SEPTIN8). SEPTIN8 is also found to co-localize with acetyl-alpha tubulin, suggesting its involvement in cilia structure (Keele2021Sept8SEPTIN8).

In cancer models, SEPTIN8 is part of the septin complex that interacts with HMGB1, a protein involved in RNA processing and ribosome biogenesis. This interaction is observed in both cytoplasmic and nuclear interactomes, highlighting SEPTIN8's potential role in RNA metabolic processes (BarreiroAlonso2021HMGB1).
