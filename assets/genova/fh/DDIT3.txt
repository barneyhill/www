# DDIT3

## Overview
DDIT3, also known as CHOP or GADD153, is a gene that encodes the DNA damage inducible transcript 3 protein, a transcription factor involved in the cellular stress response. The protein is characterized by its basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain, which facilitates DNA binding and dimerization, allowing it to regulate gene expression under stress conditions (Canales2017Hidden). DDIT3 is primarily activated during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and functions as a dominant negative inhibitor of transcription by forming heterodimers with other C/EBP family members (Bento2009DDIT3CHOP). The protein's role is crucial in maintaining cellular homeostasis, as it modulates pathways that can lead to apoptosis or cell cycle arrest in response to stress (Jauhiainen2012Distinct). DDIT3's dysregulation is implicated in various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders, metabolic diseases, and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Berastegui2021Transcriptional; Li2014New).

## Structure
The DDIT3 gene encodes the CHOP protein, which is characterized by its intrinsically disordered nature in the absence of DNA. The primary structure of CHOP includes a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain, which is crucial for DNA binding and dimerization (Canales2017Hidden). The secondary structure of CHOP features segments with α-helical propensity, particularly within the bZIP domain and the N-terminal region. These α-helical segments are located at residues 15-22, 57-62, and 99-104, with the latter being part of the DNA-binding domain (Canales2017Hidden).

The tertiary structure of CHOP is not well-defined due to its disordered nature, but it is suggested that the presence of α-helical segments may facilitate interactions with other macromolecules through disorder-to-order transitions (Canales2017Hidden). The quaternary structure involves the formation of heterodimers with other C/EBP family members, which is essential for its function as a transcriptional regulator (Ron1992CHOP).

CHOP can undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which may influence its activity and interactions (Ron1992CHOP). The protein's structure and interactions are critical for its role in the cellular stress response.

## Function
DDIT3, also known as CHOP or GADD153, is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the cellular stress response, particularly under conditions of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In healthy human cells, DDIT3 is typically not expressed unless the cells are under stress conditions. It is involved in regulating gene expression and protein activation programs that help minimize damage or induce apoptosis when stress is detected (Jauhiainen2012Distinct).

DDIT3 functions both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, with distinct roles in each location. In the cytoplasm, it regulates genes associated with cellular movement, cell death, development, and proliferation. It negatively affects cellular movement by downregulating genes such as DSTN, FN1, HAS2, and CSPG4, while upregulating ATF3, which blocks migration (Jauhiainen2012Distinct). In the nucleus, DDIT3 acts as a dominant negative factor, primarily repressing genes involved in cell death, development, growth, and the cell cycle. This nuclear activity can cause a transient G1 arrest in the cell cycle, accumulating cells in the G1 phase and depleting them from the S and G2 phases (Jauhiainen2012Distinct).

DDIT3's expression and function are tightly regulated and context-dependent, highlighting its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis during stress (Jauhiainen2012Distinct).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the DDIT3 gene, also known as CHOP, are implicated in various diseases. In neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), DDIT3 is upregulated due to protein misfolding and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, contributing to neuronal dysfunction and cell death. This upregulation is linked to increased production of β-amyloid, a key factor in AD pathogenesis, and is associated with mutations in presenilin-1, which exacerbate neurodegeneration (Li2014New).

In metabolic diseases, particularly diabetes, DDIT3 is involved in ER stress-induced apoptosis of pancreatic beta-cells, a critical factor in diabetes progression. It mediates the connection between unfolded protein accumulation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis, contributing to the disease's pathogenesis (Li2014New).

DDIT3 also plays a role in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), where its overexpression in hematopoietic stem cells leads to a transcriptional state similar to MDS, characterized by impaired erythroid differentiation and dyserythropoiesis. This suggests a potential oncogenic role for DDIT3 in MDS (Berastegui2021Transcriptional).

In myxoid liposarcoma, the FUS-DDIT3 fusion oncoprotein affects the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, contributing to the disease's pathogenesis by regulating cancer stem cell properties and promoting tumor cell invasion and metastasis (Dolatabadi2022FUSDDIT3).

## Interactions
DDIT3, also known as CHOP or GADD153, is a transcription factor that interacts with various proteins, primarily through its basic leucine zipper (BZIP) domain. It forms heterodimers with other C/EBP family members and leucine zipper proteins, acting as a dominant negative inhibitor of transcription (Bento2009DDIT3CHOP). DDIT3 cannot form homodimers but binds as heterodimers to specific DNA sites, influencing the transcription of downstream target genes (Jauhiainen2012Distinct).

DDIT3 interacts with cAMP responsive element (CRE) sites, as several CRE binding proteins belong to the BZIP family, which can form heterodimers with DDIT3 (Jauhiainen2012Distinct). It may also bind and sequester other BZIP transcription factors, preventing their nuclear localization and modifying their activities (Jauhiainen2012Distinct).

In the context of the fusion oncoprotein FUS-DDIT3, DDIT3 binds cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) without altering its expression or phosphorylation status. This interaction increases the binding affinity of CDK2 to cytoskeletal proteins such as plectin, myosin, and vimentin in cells expressing FUS-DDIT3 and DDIT3 (Bento2009DDIT3CHOP). The intrinsically disordered domain of DDIT3 allows it to interact with proteins beyond leucine zippers, suggesting diverse and context-dependent interactions (Jauhiainen2012Distinct).
