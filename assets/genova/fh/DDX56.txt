# DDX56

## Overview
DDX56 is a gene that encodes the protein DEAD-box helicase 56, a member of the DEAD-box protein family characterized by the conserved Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD) motif. This protein functions primarily as an RNA helicase, playing a critical role in ribosome biogenesis and assembly, which are essential for protein synthesis within cells (Linder2011From; Taschuk2020DEADBox). DEAD-box helicase 56 is predominantly localized in the nucleolus, where it is involved in the synthesis and processing of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and the assembly of the 60S ribosomal subunit (Zhang2021DEAD-Box). Beyond its fundamental role in normal cellular processes, DDX56 has been implicated in various cancers, where its overexpression is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Zhou2022DDX56; Ruan2022Pancancer).

## Structure
DDX56 is a member of the DEAD-box protein family, characterized by the conserved Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD) motif, which is crucial for its function as an RNA helicase. The primary structure of DDX56 includes a conserved helicase core domain, which is typical of DEAD-box proteins and is essential for ATP binding and hydrolysis, as well as RNA binding (Linder2011From; Zhu2020Integrated). 

The secondary structure of DDX56 likely involves alpha helices and beta sheets, forming a compact, globular tertiary structure, which is common among DEAD-box proteins (Linder2011From). The helicase core is composed of two RecA-like domains, which are involved in the binding and remodeling of RNA and RNP structures (Linder2011From). 

DDX56 may also participate in quaternary structures through interactions with other proteins or RNA, as suggested by its involvement in complex gene regulatory networks and its role in ribosome biogenesis (Zhu2020Integrated; 1). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur, although specific modifications for DDX56 are not detailed in the available context (Zhu2020Integrated).

## Function
DDX56 (DEAD-box helicase 56) is a nucleolar protein that plays a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis and assembly, which are essential processes for protein synthesis in cells (Zheng2023Role; Taschuk2020DEADBox). It is involved in various aspects of RNA metabolism, including transcription, pre-mRNA splicing, and RNA degradation (Zhang2021DEAD-Box). DDX56 participates in the assembly of the 60S ribosomal subunit and is a component of free nucleoplasm 65S preribosomal particles (Zhang2021DEAD-Box). 

In healthy human cells, DDX56 is primarily active in the nucleolus, where it contributes to the synthesis and processing of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) (Taschuk2020DEADBox). It is believed to be involved in the remodeling of pre-ribosomal RNP complexes to promote rRNA biogenesis and in the release of snoRNAs after rRNA modification (Taschuk2020DEADBox). The protein's cellular localization in the nucleolus and cytoplasm is significant for its role in ribosome-related processes (Zheng2023Role). Through these activities, DDX56 supports cellular growth and protein synthesis, which are vital for maintaining normal cellular functions.

## Clinical Significance
DDX56 is implicated in several cancers due to its overexpression and role in tumor progression. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), DDX56 is significantly overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis, including shorter overall survival and disease-free survival. It promotes HCC proliferation by activating the MIST1 transcription factor, which regulates the PTEN-AKT signaling pathway, crucial for tumor growth (Zhou2022DDX56). DDX56 is also overexpressed in other cancers such as colorectal cancer, where it is linked to increased cell proliferation and poor clinical outcomes. Its overexpression in colorectal cancer is associated with lymphatic invasion and distant metastasis, and it acts through oncogenic splicing abnormalities (Kouyama2019Oncogenic).

In osteosarcoma, DDX56 functions as an oncogene, with its knockdown inhibiting cell growth and clonogenic capacity (Zhu2020Integrated). Pan-cancer analyses have shown that DDX56 is overexpressed in multiple tumor types, correlating with advanced disease stages and poor prognosis. It is also associated with immune infiltration and drug resistance, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Ruan2022Pancancer). These findings highlight the clinical significance of DDX56 in cancer development and progression.

## Interactions
DDX56, a member of the DEAD-box protein family, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing significant roles in cellular processes. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), DDX56 interacts with the transcriptional regulator MECOM, promoting the expression of the transcription factor MIST1. This interaction enhances MECOM's binding to the MIST1 promoter, facilitating transcription through H3K9 monomethylation, which is crucial for HCC proliferation (Zhou2022DDX56). DDX56 also binds directly to the MIST1 promoter region, as confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, indicating a specific interaction with nucleic acids (Zhou2022DDX56).

In the context of viral infections, DDX56 interacts with viral RNA, particularly sequences forming secondary structures, and destabilizes them, suggesting a role in antiviral defense (Bonaventure2022DExH/D-box). In mouse embryonic stem cells, DDX56 interacts with the core transcriptional factors Oct4 and Sox2, essential for maintaining pluripotency and proliferation. The interaction with Sox2 is particularly strong and crucial for cell proliferation (Wang2020Ddx56). These interactions highlight DDX56's multifaceted role in regulating gene expression and cellular processes.
