# GLUD2

## Overview
The GLUD2 gene encodes the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase 2 (hGDH2), a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the metabolism of the neurotransmitter glutamate. As a member of the oxidoreductase family, hGDH2 is primarily expressed in the brain, particularly in astrocytes, where it catalyzes the oxidative deamination of glutamate to α-ketoglutarate, linking neurotransmitter cycling to energy production via the Krebs cycle (Franceschi2018Mitochondrial; Shashidharan2013The). Unlike its isoenzyme hGDH1, hGDH2 is characterized by its resistance to GTP inhibition, allowing it to maintain activity regardless of the cellular energy state, which is crucial during periods of high synaptic activity (Shashidharan2013The; Plaitakis2003Study). The enzyme's unique structural adaptations, including specific amino acid substitutions, enable it to function efficiently in the acidic environment of astrocytes, supporting neurotransmitter balance and energy metabolism in the brain (Zaganas2012Expression; Plaitakis2003Study). The GLUD2 gene and its encoded enzyme are of significant interest in neurological research due to their involvement in conditions such as glioblastoma and Parkinson's disease, where alterations in GLUD2 expression and function have been linked to disease progression and patient outcomes (Franceschi2018Mitochondrial; Zhang2020Functional).

## Structure
The GLUD2 gene encodes the human glutamate dehydrogenase 2 (hGDH2) protein, which is a hexameric enzyme composed of two trimers. Each subunit of hGDH2 consists of several domains: the glutamate-binding domain, the NAD+ binding domain, the antenna, the pivot helix, and the C-terminal α-helix (Dimovasili2021Crystal). The NAD+ binding domain is characterized by a mixed, six-stranded β-sheet surrounded by α-helices, while the glutamate-binding domain features a central, highly twisted, five-stranded, mixed β-sheet surrounded by five α-helices (Dimovasili2021Crystal).

The regulatory domain includes the antenna and the pivot helix, which are crucial for inter-subunit communication and allosteric regulation. The antenna consists of an ascending helix and a descending random coil strand with a small alpha-helix (Zaganas2014The). The pivot helix plays a significant role in the enzyme's conformational changes, affecting the opening and closing of the catalytic cleft (Kanavouras2007Properties).

hGDH2 has evolved distinct properties due to specific amino acid substitutions, such as Gly456Ala and Arg443Ser, which contribute to its resistance to GTP inhibition and affect its basal activity (Plaitakis2003Study; Dimovasili2021Crystal). These structural features and evolutionary changes highlight the unique functional characteristics of hGDH2 compared to its closely related isoenzyme, hGDH1.

## Function
The GLUD2 gene encodes the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase 2 (hGDH2), which plays a critical role in the metabolism of glutamate, a key neurotransmitter in the brain. This enzyme is primarily expressed in astrocytes, where it facilitates the conversion of glutamate to α-ketoglutarate, a process that is essential for energy production through the Krebs cycle (Franceschi2018Mitochondrial; Shashidharan2013The). Unlike its counterpart hGDH1, hGDH2 is not inhibited by GTP, allowing it to function independently of the cellular energy state, which is particularly important during intense excitatory neurotransmission (Shashidharan2013The; Plaitakis2003Study).

hGDH2 is adapted to operate efficiently in the acidic environment of astrocytes following glutamate uptake, which is crucial for maintaining neurotransmitter balance and energy metabolism in the brain (Zaganas2012Expression; Plaitakis2003Study). The enzyme's activity is modulated by ADP and L-leucine, which enhances its function under conditions of low energy charge, typical during high synaptic activity (Shashidharan2013The; Kanavouras2007Properties). This adaptation supports the metabolic recycling processes essential for glutamatergic transmission, contributing to the brain's ability to meet increased energy demands (Plaitakis2011The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GLUD2 gene have been implicated in several neurological conditions. In glioblastoma (GBM), a highly malignant brain tumor, GLUD2 expression is linked to tumor progression and patient prognosis. Overexpression of GLUD2 is associated with increased survival and lower tumor grading, while its silencing leads to increased tumor aggressiveness. This suggests that GLUD2 could be a potential therapeutic target for GBM treatment (Franceschi2018Mitochondrial).

In Parkinson's disease (PD), a specific GLUD2 variant, T1492G, has been associated with early onset in male patients. This mutation affects mitochondrial function and glutamate metabolism, leading to increased neuronal apoptosis and impaired energy production. The variant exacerbates dopaminergic neuron death and motor deficits in a murine model of PD, highlighting its potential role in the disease's pathogenesis (Plaitakis2011The; Zhang2020Functional).

The GLUD2 gene's role in glutamate metabolism and mitochondrial function makes it a significant factor in these diseases, with its mutations and expression levels influencing disease onset and progression. These findings underscore the importance of GLUD2 in neurological health and disease.
