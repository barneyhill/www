# RPS6KA2

## Overview
RPS6KA2 is a gene that encodes the ribosomal protein S6 kinase A2, a serine/threonine kinase involved in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. This kinase plays a critical role in cellular processes such as growth, proliferation, and survival by phosphorylating ribosomal protein S6, which is essential for ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis (Yu2021Peptide). The RPS6KA2 protein features two catalytic domains and undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which are vital for its function and interaction with other proteins (Fu2023ncRNAs). It is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing cellular responses to external stimuli and contributing to organismal development and homeostasis. RPS6KA2 is implicated in various diseases, including cancer, where it may affect tumor progression and drug resistance (Slattery2011Genetic; Pancholi2008ERBB2).

## Structure
The RPS6KA2 protein is a serine/threonine kinase that is part of the ribosomal protein S6 kinase (RPS6K) family. It features two distinct catalytic domains: one homologous to the cyclic AMP kinase family and the other to the phosphorylase kinase family, which contribute to its autophosphorylation upon growth factor stimulation (Fu2023ncRNAs). The protein is involved in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway and undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which are crucial for its function (Fu2023ncRNAs).

The RPS6KA2 protein interacts with PDZ domains, particularly the Scribble PDZ1 domain, through its phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms. Phosphorylation at specific sites, such as the p-3 position, significantly affects its binding affinity and specificity (Sundell2018Proteome‐wide). The protein's interaction with PDZ domains is modulated by key residues in the PDZ1 domain, including K746, R762, and R801, which stabilize these interactions (Sundell2018Proteome‐wide).

RPS6KA2 can exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may influence its functional roles and interactions within cellular pathways (Fu2023ncRNAs). However, specific details about the tertiary and quaternary structures of RPS6KA2 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
RPS6KA2 encodes a serine/threonine kinase that is part of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, which is crucial for regulating cell growth, proliferation, and survival. This kinase is involved in the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6, a process essential for ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis, thereby playing a vital role in maintaining cellular functions and homeostasis (Yu2021Peptide). RPS6KA2 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences various cellular responses to external stimuli, impacting organismal development and homeostasis.

In healthy human cells, RPS6KA2 is involved in controlling cell growth and differentiation, with expression observed in various tissues, including the adrenal glands (Ognibene2020Identification). It also plays a role in the phosphorylation of the estrogen receptor (ESR1) at serine 167, which is part of the signaling pathways that regulate cell survival and proliferation (Pancholi2008ERBB2). The kinase's activity is crucial for normal ribosome biogenesis, a process that is often hyperactivated in cancer cells, suggesting its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions (Yu2021Peptide).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RPS6KA2 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly various forms of cancer. In colon and rectal cancer, specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in RPS6KA2, such as rs16898963, rs2072638, and rs9459678, have been associated with an increased risk of colon cancer, while SNPs like rs9295361 and rs6911624 are linked to rectal cancer risk, with the former increasing risk and the latter having a protective effect (Slattery2011Genetic). The gene also interacts with other genes in carcinogenic pathways, potentially contributing to the development of tumors with specific mutations (Slattery2011Genetic).

In high-risk neuroblastoma, low expression levels of RPS6KA2 are associated with poor survival outcomes, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor gene (Ognibene2020Identification). Similarly, in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma, mutations in RPS6KA2 are part of a 21-gene mutational signature linked to poor prognosis and therapy resistance (Ow2014Identification). In Parkinson's disease, RPS6KA2 SNPs are involved in the severity of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia, indicating its role in neurological disorders (MartínFlores2018MTOR).

## Interactions
RPS6KA2, also known as ribosomal protein S6 kinase A2, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It is a serine/threonine kinase that participates in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, interacting with MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1, which phosphorylate and activate it (Pancholi2008ERBB2). In the context of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells, RPS6KA2 is activated by MAPK3/1, leading to the phosphorylation of the estrogen receptor (ESR1) at serine 167, a process that is crucial for ligand-independent activation of ESR1 (Pancholi2008ERBB2). This phosphorylation is associated with resistance to endocrine treatment, highlighting the role of RPS6KA2 in cancer cell survival and proliferation (Pancholi2008ERBB2).

RPS6KA2 also interacts with the pro-apoptotic protein BAD, phosphorylating it at serine 112, which prevents apoptosis and contributes to cell survival in tamoxifen-resistant cells (Pancholi2008ERBB2). These interactions underscore the kinase's role in modulating cell growth and survival pathways, particularly in cancer contexts where it may contribute to drug resistance and tumor progression.
