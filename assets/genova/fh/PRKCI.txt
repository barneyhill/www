# PRKCI

## Overview
The PRKCI gene encodes protein kinase C iota (PKCι), an atypical member of the protein kinase C (PKC) family, which is categorized as a serine/threonine kinase. Unlike conventional PKC isozymes, PKCι does not require calcium or diacylglycerol for activation, instead relying on protein scaffolds for its activation (Newton2018Protein). PKCι is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including the regulation of cell polarity, differentiation, and the actin cytoskeleton, through its interactions with other proteins such as Par6 and Par3 (Soloff2004Targeted; Mah2016Prkci). The gene is frequently implicated in oncogenic pathways, with its amplification and overexpression linked to several cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer and high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma, where it contributes to tumor progression and immune evasion (Parker2014Atypical; Sarkar2017PRKCI). As such, PRKCI and its encoded protein PKCι are considered potential therapeutic targets in cancer treatment.

## Structure
Protein kinase C iota (PKC ι), encoded by the PRKCI gene, is an atypical protein kinase C isozyme. It consists of 596 amino acids and is part of the serine/threonine kinase family (Shah2022Impact). The protein features several distinct domains, including a PB1 domain, a C1 domain, and a kinase domain. The PB1 domain is crucial for protein-protein interactions, particularly in oncogenic signaling pathways, and contains a unique cysteine residue (Cys69) within the OPCA motif, which is essential for its interaction with Par6 (Parker2014Atypical). The C1 domain in PKC ι is modified and does not bind diacylglycerol, distinguishing it from other PKC isozymes (Newton2018Protein).

PKC ι does not require calcium or diacylglycerol for activation, unlike conventional PKC isozymes, and is instead activated by protein scaffolds (Newton2018Protein). The kinase domain is highly conserved across the PKC family, indicating its critical role in protein stability and function (Shah2022Impact). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are common and play a role in regulating the protein's activity (Shah2022Impact). The protein's structure and function can be significantly affected by deleterious missense variants, which may lead to disease (Shah2022Impact).

## Function
The PRKCI gene encodes protein kinase C iota (PKCλ/ι), an atypical protein kinase C involved in several critical cellular processes. PKCλ/ι plays a vital role in establishing cell polarity, which is essential for various cellular functions such as cell migration, asymmetric cell division, and epithelial formation. It is a part of the Par3-Par6-aPKC complex, which organizes proteins linked to tight and adherens junctions, crucial for maintaining tissue architecture (Mah2016Prkci).

In the context of placental development, PKCλ/ι is crucial for the differentiation of cytotrophoblast progenitors into syncytiotrophoblast cells, which are essential for nutrient and gas exchange between the mother and fetus. This process involves maintaining the expression of key transcription factors like GCM1, GATA2, and PPARγ (Bhattacharya2020Atypical).

PKCλ/ι is also involved in the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells into mature oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system. It is crucial for early stages of oligodendrocyte progenitor cell differentiation, particularly in asymmetric cell division and early specification of oligodendrocyte fate (Mercau2024Timeresolved).

PKCλ/ι's role extends to regulating the actin cytoskeleton, potentially through interactions with proteins like Cdc42 and PAR-6, affecting actin assembly and focal adhesion contacts (Soloff2004Targeted).

## Clinical Significance
The PRKCI gene, encoding protein kinase C iota (PKCι), is frequently implicated in various cancers due to its amplification and overexpression. In high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC), PRKCI is often amplified, with 78% of samples showing increased somatic copy number, which is associated with poor prognosis. This amplification contributes to an immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment by up-regulating TNFα, leading to increased myeloid-derived suppressor cells and reduced cytotoxic T-cell infiltration (Sarkar2017PRKCI). 

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), PRKCI is co-amplified with the ECT2 gene, forming an oncogenic complex that promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and tumor invasion (Parker2014Atypical). PRKCI is also overexpressed in pancreatic cancer, where it plays a role in tumor initiation and progression by altering immune cell populations and promoting an immune-suppressive environment (Inman2022Prkci).

PRKCI's role extends to esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), where its amplification is associated with larger tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and advanced tumor stages (Yang2007Amplification). These findings highlight PRKCI as a potential therapeutic target and biomarker for various cancers.

## Interactions
PRKCI (protein kinase C iota) is involved in various protein-protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It interacts with RIPK2 in pancreatic cancer, forming a complex that enhances the phosphorylation of key signaling proteins such as NF-κB, JNK, and ERK, which are crucial for cancer progression (Jiao2023Paired). PRKCI also interacts with Par6 and Par3, forming a complex that is essential for maintaining epithelial cell polarity. This complex localizes to the apical compartment of polarized cell membranes, and its disruption is associated with cancer (Parker2014Atypical).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), PRKCI forms an oncogenic complex with Par6 and ECT2, driving cell transformation and contributing to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Parker2014Atypical). PRKCI also interacts with autophagy-related proteins, such as ATG8 family members and the autophagy cargo adaptor P62, through PB1-PB1 domain interactions, suggesting a role in regulating autophagy (Inman2022Prkci). These interactions highlight PRKCI's involvement in various signaling pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer.
