# SLC10A7

## Overview
SLC10A7 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 10 member 7, which is a member of the solute carrier family 10. This protein is characterized by its unique structure, comprising 10 transmembrane domains, distinguishing it from other family members that typically have seven transmembrane domains (Godoy2007Molecular). Despite being part of the Sodium Bile Acid Symporter Family, SLC10A7 does not transport bile acids or sodium ions, and its specific substrates remain unidentified (Zhang2023Identification). Functionally, SLC10A7 acts as a negative regulator of intracellular calcium signaling and is crucial for bone mineralization and skeletal development (Ashikov2018Integrating; Karakus2020The). Mutations in the SLC10A7 gene are associated with various clinical conditions, including skeletal dysplasia and amelogenesis imperfecta, underscoring its significance in human health (Dubail2018SLC10A7).

## Structure
The SLC10A7 protein is a member of the solute carrier family 10 and is characterized by a unique structure compared to other family members. It consists of 340 amino acids in humans, with a predicted topology of 10 transmembrane domains, which is distinct from the seven-transmembrane domain topology typical of other SLC10 family members (Godoy2007Molecular). The N-terminal and C-terminal ends of the protein are oriented intracellularly (Godoy2007Molecular).

The SLC10A7 protein includes a sequence motif located between amino acid positions 44-225, which is part of the Sodium Bile Acid Symporter Family (SBF) domain (Godoy2007Molecular). Despite its classification in the SBF family, SLC10A7 does not transport bile acids or Na+, and its specific substrates remain unidentified (Zhang2023Identification).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation have been predicted, although their functional implications are not fully understood (Godoy2007Molecular). The protein is expressed in various tissues, with alternative splicing resulting in several transcript variants, including a human-specific variant with an additional exon (Godoy2007Molecular).

## Function
The SLC10A7 gene encodes a protein that functions as a negative regulator of intracellular calcium signaling in healthy human cells. It is involved in modulating store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) through the plasma membrane, where its expression is inversely related to calcium influx. When SLC10A7 is deficient, there is an increase in calcium influx following the depletion of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium stores, while overexpression of SLC10A7 limits calcium influx (Karakus2020The; Wannowius2021Functional). The protein is thought to interact with key components of calcium signaling, such as STIM1, Orai1, and SERCA2, potentially inhibiting their activity to regulate calcium homeostasis (Karakus2020The).

SLC10A7 is also crucial for bone mineralization and proper skeletal development. It is involved in post-Golgi protein transport and glycosylation, processes essential for the formation and mineralization of the extracellular matrix. The protein is localized to the Golgi apparatus, where it plays a role in the transport of glycoproteins and proteoglycans, impacting skeletal and bone development (Ashikov2018Integrating). Deficiencies in SLC10A7 can lead to skeletal dysplasia and amelogenesis imperfecta, highlighting its importance in bone and tooth development (Dubail2018SLC10A7).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC10A7 gene are associated with several severe disease phenotypes, including skeletal dysplasia, amelogenesis imperfecta, osteoporosis, skeletal deformations, facial abnormalities, visual and hearing impairments, and intellectual disabilities. These conditions are linked to the gene's role in calcium signaling, as SLC10A7 expression is negatively correlated with store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) via the plasma membrane. SLC10A7-deficient cells show increased calcium influx, while overexpression limits it (Wannowius2021Functional).

SLC10A7 mutations have been identified in patients with skeletal dysplasia and amelogenesis imperfecta, following a recessive inheritance pattern. These mutations impair SLC10A7 protein synthesis, leading to reduced signals in immunocytofluorescence and western blot analyses. Affected individuals exhibit severe short stature, microretrognathia, femoral dislocations, and advanced ossification (Dubail2018SLC10A7). The gene is also implicated in glycosaminoglycan (GAG) biosynthesis, with deficiencies leading to altered GAG synthesis, particularly affecting heparan sulfate content, which is essential for normal skeletal and dental development (Dubail2018SLC10A7).

A novel homozygous nonsense variant in SLC10A7 is associated with SSASKS (short stature, amelogenesis imperfecta, and skeletal dysplasia with scoliosis), a rare autosomal recessive disorder. This condition is linked to abnormal N-glycosylation of proteins or lipids, and is considered a subtype of congenital disorders of glycosylation (Zhang2023Identification).

## Interactions
SLC10A7, also known as RCAS, is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is involved in intracellular calcium signaling. It interacts with components of the store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) mechanism, particularly STIM and ORAI proteins. SLC10A7 is identified as a negative regulator of SOCE, where its overexpression in HEK293 cells limits calcium influx following ER depletion. This suggests that SLC10A7 may restrict the transport capacity of SERCA or act as a negative regulator of STIM and/or ORAI (Wannowius2021Functional).

Co-localization studies indicate a high degree of overlap between SLC10A7 and STIM, suggesting a regulatory role in STIM and SERCA interactions, but not with ORAI. This implies that SLC10A7 might limit STIM's interaction with ORAI and negatively regulate calcium sequestration via SERCA (Wannowius2021Functional). The protein is also found in the Golgi and plasma membrane, and its interactions with STIM are reduced after treatment with thapsigargin, which depletes calcium stores in the ER (Wannowius2021Functional).

The exact subcellular localization and interactions of SLC10A7 require further investigation with untagged native proteins to fully understand its role in calcium signaling and its potential involvement in disease phenotypes (Wannowius2021Functional).
