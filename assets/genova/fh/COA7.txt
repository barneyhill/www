# COA7

## Overview
The COA7 gene encodes the cytochrome c oxidase assembly factor 7, a protein integral to the assembly and maintenance of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, particularly complexes I and IV. This protein is categorized as a heme-binding protein and is involved in the early stages of complex IV assembly within mitochondria. Structurally, COA7 is characterized by its unique arrangement of α-helices and Sel1-like repeat domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions crucial for its function. The protein is imported into the mitochondrial intermembrane space via the mitochondrial intermembrane space import and assembly (MIA) pathway, where it interacts with the oxidoreductase MIA40. This interaction is essential for the stable accumulation of COA7, contributing to the biogenesis of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes. Mutations in the COA7 gene are linked to various mitochondrial disorders, underscoring its importance in cellular energy metabolism and neurological health (Ghezzi2018Human; Formosa2021Mitochondrial; Mohanraj2019Inhibition).

## Structure
The COA7 protein, also known as cytochrome c oxidase assembly factor 7, is a heme-binding protein involved in the early stages of complex IV assembly in mitochondria. Structurally, COA7 is composed of 11 α-helices arranged as five helix-turn-helix (α/α) repeats, with lengths varying from 30-36 residues, and an additional C-terminal helix. These helices form an elongated, right-handed super-helix with distinct concave and convex faces (Formosa2021Mitochondrial). The COA7 sequence includes 13 cysteine residues, with five intramolecular disulfide bonds bridging pairs of helices within the α/α repeats, which are conserved across metazoans (Formosa2021Mitochondrial; Mohanraj2019Inhibition).

The protein's tertiary structure is characterized by a crescent-shaped fold, and it forms oligomeric structures in solution, which may facilitate protein-protein interactions in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (Formosa2021Mitochondrial). The quaternary structure includes both monomeric and dimeric species, with concentration-dependent oligomerization behavior (Formosa2021Mitochondrial). COA7 contains Sel1-like repeat (SLR) domains, a subclass of tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) proteins, which are involved in protein-protein interactions (Formosa2021Mitochondrial). The protein binds heme via axial His/Met coordination to the heme iron, despite not resembling well-characterized heme-binding proteins (Formosa2021Mitochondrial).

## Function
COA7, also known as cytochrome c oxidase assembly factor 7, plays a critical role in the assembly and maintenance of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, particularly complexes I and IV. In healthy human cells, COA7 is imported into the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) via the mitochondrial intermembrane space import and assembly (MIA) pathway, where it interacts with the oxidoreductase MIA40. This interaction is essential for the stable accumulation of COA7 in the IMS, contributing to the biogenesis of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes (Mohanraj2019Inhibition).

COA7 functions as a non-canonical substrate of the MIA40 pathway, and its proper import is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function. The protein is involved in the assembly of respiratory chain complexes, ensuring the integrity and function of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, which is vital for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation (Mohanraj2019Inhibition).

In the IMS, COA7 exists as an oxidized protein, forming disulfide bonds that are important for its structural stability and function. This structural integrity is necessary for its role in the assembly of the respiratory chain, highlighting its importance in cellular energy metabolism (Mohanraj2019Inhibition).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the COA7 gene are associated with a range of mitochondrial disorders, primarily affecting the nervous system. These mutations can lead to mitochondrial leukoencephalopathy and cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiency, resulting in symptoms such as severe ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, and mild cognitive impairment (Martinez2016COA7(C1orf163RESA1) page 0 of 2). Patients with COA7 mutations often exhibit early-onset neurological symptoms, including progressive ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, and cavitating leukodystrophy of the brain (Ghezzi2018Human).

Biallelic variants in COA7 have been linked to developmental regression, progressive spasticity, and brain atrophy, as seen in a case study of a Chinese patient (Ban2021Biallelic). These mutations can also cause mitochondrial encephalopathy, characterized by defective assembly and function of respiratory chain complexes, leading to undetectable levels of COA7 in patient-derived fibroblasts (Mohanraj2019Inhibition).

COA7-related disorders encompass a spectrum of conditions, including spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy type 3 (SCAN3), dystonia, and parkinsonism. These conditions are marked by symptoms such as cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and severe muscle weakness (Higuchi2023Dystonia). The phenotypic spectrum of COA7-related disorders highlights the gene's critical role in mitochondrial function and its impact on neurological health.

## Interactions
COA7, also known as cytochrome c oxidase assembly factor 7, is involved in several interactions crucial for mitochondrial function. It is a non-canonical substrate of the mitochondrial intermembrane space import and assembly (MIA) pathway, specifically interacting with the MIA40 protein through disulfide bonds. This interaction is essential for the import of COA7 into the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) (Mohanraj2019Inhibition). COA7's interaction with MIA40 is facilitated by the CPC motif of MIA40, where the second cysteine (C55) is crucial for forming disulfide bonds with COA7 (Mohanraj2019Inhibition).

COA7 also interacts with other mitochondrial proteins, such as complex IV subunits COX6A and COX6B, which are affected by COA7 mutations (Mohanraj2019Inhibition). Although COA7 does not form stable interactions with complex IV components, it enriches several intermembrane space proteins, including apoptosis-inducing factor 1 (AIFM1) and CHCHD4, which are involved in disulfide bond formation (Formosa2021Mitochondrial). These interactions suggest COA7's role in maintaining mitochondrial protein stability and function. COA7's structural features, including its five Sel1-like repeat domains, facilitate these protein-protein interactions, which are critical for its function in complex IV assembly (Formosa2021Mitochondrial).
