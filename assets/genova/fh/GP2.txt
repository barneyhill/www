# GP2

## Overview
GP2 is a gene that encodes glycoprotein 2, a significant membrane protein primarily expressed in pancreatic acinar cells. Glycoprotein 2 is categorized as a glycoprotein and is integral to the formation and function of zymogen granules, which are crucial for the storage and secretion of digestive enzymes. The protein is characterized by a complex structure that includes a cysteine-rich domain, an epidermal growth factor-like domain, and a zona pellucida domain, which are essential for its structural integrity and function (Lin2021Glycoprotein). Glycoprotein 2 is anchored to the membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, facilitating its secretion into the extracellular compartment (Fukuoka1992GP2THP). Beyond its role in enzyme secretion, glycoprotein 2 is involved in immune functions within the gastrointestinal tract, acting as a receptor on M cells to facilitate bacterial uptake and contribute to gut mucosal immunity (IWANAGA2023GP2expressing). Variants and alterations in the GP2 gene have been associated with several diseases, including pancreatic cancer and inflammatory bowel diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Lin2021Glycoprotein; Lin2020Genomewide).

## Structure
The GP2 protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. It features a cysteine-rich domain known as D8C, an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, and a zona pellucida (ZP) domain, which is a conserved module found in various glycoproteins that form filamentous homopolymers (Lin2021Glycoprotein). The ZP domain is crucial for the protein's structural integrity and function, as mutations in ZP genes can lead to defective polymerization and are associated with human pathologies (Lin2021Glycoprotein).

GP2 is anchored to the membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, facilitating its apical secretion into the extracellular compartment (Lin2021Glycoprotein; Fukuoka1992GP2THP). The protein also contains multiple N-linked glycosylation sites, which are common post-translational modifications that influence its stability and function (Fukuoka1992GP2THP). GP2 shares structural similarities with uromodulin, suggesting an evolutionary relationship and potential functional parallels (Lin2021Glycoprotein).

The protein's ability to self-associate in a pH- and ion-dependent manner suggests a role in sorting into regulated secretory compartments (Fukuoka1992GP2THP). Despite these insights, the complete three-dimensional structure of GP2 remains to be fully elucidated (Lin2021Glycoprotein).

## Function
GP2 (glycoprotein 2) is primarily expressed in pancreatic acinar cells, where it plays a significant role in the formation and function of zymogen granules, which are essential for the storage and secretion of digestive enzymes. GP2 is a major membrane protein of these granules, accounting for approximately 35% of the total zymogen granule membrane protein. It is involved in the sorting and packaging of digestive enzymes, such as amylase, to the zymogen granules, and is cleaved from the membrane and secreted into the pancreatic duct during the secretory process (Yu2004Absence; Scheele1994Role).

In addition to its role in enzyme secretion, GP2 is involved in immune functions within the gastrointestinal tract. It acts as a receptor on M cells in the small intestine, facilitating the uptake of bacteria and contributing to gut mucosal immunity. GP2 binds to FimH-expressing Gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, potentially preventing bacterial adhesion and invasion, thus playing a role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis (Lin2021Glycoprotein; IWANAGA2023GP2expressing).

Despite its abundance, studies on GP2-deficient mice suggest that GP2 is not essential for pancreatic exocrine secretion or zymogen granule formation, indicating its primary functions may occur post-secretion (Yu2004Absence).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GP2 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. A notable missense variant, rs78193826, is associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer, particularly in Asian populations. This variant is considered deleterious, with a high CADD score, indicating its potential impact on protein function (Lin2021Glycoprotein; Lin2020Genomewide). The GP2 variant rs117267808, in complete linkage disequilibrium with rs78193826, is also associated with pancreatic cancer and type 2 diabetes in the Japanese population (Lin2021Glycoprotein).

GP2 has been implicated in autoimmune diseases such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, where it serves as a target for disease-specific autoantibodies. These autoantibodies are prevalent in patients with these conditions, suggesting GP2's role as a potential serologic marker for inflammatory bowel disease (Lin2021Glycoprotein). Additionally, GP2 variants have been associated with gestational diabetes mellitus, with the SNP rs117267808 linked to increased risk and altered fasting glucose levels (Zhang2021Common).

Alterations in GP2 expression have been observed in pancreatic cancer, where its expression is lower in tumor tissues compared to normal pancreatic tissues, suggesting a role in pancreatic carcinogenesis (Lin2020Genomewide).

## Interactions
GP2 (glycoprotein 2) is involved in several protein interactions, particularly within the pancreatic zymogen granules and the immune system. It interacts with syncollin, a major membrane protein of pancreatic zymogen granules, forming specific protein-protein interactions that may stabilize syncollin's association with the membrane (KALUS2002Interaction). GP2 is also part of cholesterol-rich lipid microdomains in zymogen granule membranes, interacting with other proteins such as ZG16p, syntaxin 3, and synaptobrevin 2, which are involved in granule formation and secretion (KALUS2002Interaction).

In the immune system, GP2 binds to the scavenger receptor expressed on endothelial cells I (SREC-I) with high affinity, facilitating its internalization by cells expressing this receptor, such as monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Hölzl2011The). GP2 also interacts with bacterial type-1 fimbriae (FimH), acting as a receptor on intestinal microfold cells and playing a role in immune responses against microbes (Schierack2014Speciesspecific). This interaction is mannose-sensitive and is significant in the context of inflammatory bowel disease, where GP2 autoantibodies can inhibit FimH binding, affecting the mucosal immune response (Derer2020Inflammatory).
