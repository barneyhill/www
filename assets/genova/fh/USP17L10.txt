# USP17L10

## Overview
USP17L10 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquitin specific peptidase 17 like family member 10, which is part of the deubiquitinating enzyme family. These enzymes play a critical role in the regulation of protein degradation by removing ubiquitin moieties from ubiquitinated proteins, thus rescuing them from proteasomal degradation. The protein encoded by USP17L10 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, and immune response modulation. Its activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer and inflammatory diseases. The precise mechanisms by which USP17L10 influences these processes are still under investigation, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Qiu2020aarFDC).
