# SIAE

## Overview
The SIAE gene encodes the enzyme sialic acid acetylesterase, which is a member of the SGNH-hydrolase family. This enzyme is primarily involved in the deacetylation of O-acetylated sialic acids, a critical process for modulating immune responses and maintaining cellular communication (Visser2021Sialic; Cariappa2008B). Sialic acid acetylesterase functions intracellularly, predominantly within the Golgi apparatus and lysosomes, where it influences the acetylation state of sialic acids on glycoproteins and glycolipids (Visser2021Sialic; Chellappa2013M89V). This regulation is particularly important in B lymphocytes, where it affects the binding of CD22, a Siglec that inhibits B cell receptor (BCR) signaling, thereby contributing to immunological tolerance (Chellappa2013M89V; Cariappa2008B). Mutations in the SIAE gene have been linked to autoimmune disorders, highlighting its significance in immune regulation (Mahajan2015Sialic; Hirschfield2012Association).

## Function
The SIAE gene encodes the enzyme sialic acid acetylesterase, which plays a crucial role in the deacetylation of O-acetylated sialic acids (O-Ac-Sias). This enzyme is part of the SGNH-hydrolase family and is involved in removing acetyl groups from the 9-OH position of α2-6-linked sialic acids, a process essential for modulating immune responses and maintaining cellular communication (Visser2021Sialic; Cariappa2008B). SIAE activity is primarily intracellular, occurring in the Golgi apparatus and lysosomes, where it influences the acetylation state of sialic acids on glycoproteins and glycolipids (Visser2021Sialic; Chellappa2013M89V).

In B lymphocytes, SIAE regulates the acetylation of sialic acids, affecting the binding of CD22, a Siglec that acts as an inhibitor of B cell receptor (BCR) signaling. This regulation is crucial for normal B cell signaling and differentiation, contributing to immunological tolerance (Chellappa2013M89V; Cariappa2008B). The enzyme's function is cell-intrinsic, as it is expressed within cells rather than being secreted into the plasma (Chellappa2013M89V). Defects in SIAE activity can lead to enhanced BCR signaling and are associated with autoimmune disorders (Mandal2012Functions; Cariappa2008B).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SIAE gene, which encodes the sialic acid acetylesterase enzyme, have been linked to several autoimmune diseases. Rare loss-of-function variants of SIAE are associated with autoimmune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, suggesting that these genetic changes can disrupt normal immune regulation (Mahajan2015Sialic; Hirschfield2012Association). In particular, studies have identified non-synonymous point substitutions in the SIAE gene in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), with some variants resulting in catalytically defective proteins. These findings indicate a significant association between functionally defective SIAE variants and PBC (Hirschfield2012Association).

In mouse models, SIAE deficiency leads to enhanced B cell receptor (BCR) signaling and immune dysregulation, characterized by increased autoantibody production and the development of autoimmune-like conditions. This is due to the enzyme's role in regulating the 9-O-acetylation state of sialic acids, which affects the function of CD22, a Siglec that inhibits BCR signaling (Cariappa2008B). The absence of SIAE results in increased BCR signal strength, contributing to the loss of immunological tolerance and the potential onset of autoimmune diseases (Cariappa2008B).

## Interactions
SIAE (sialic acid acetylesterase) is involved in the regulation of B cell receptor (BCR) signaling through its interactions with several proteins in the immune system. SIAE modulates the acetylation state of sialic acids, which is crucial for the function of CD22, a Siglec that inhibits BCR signaling. CD22 is phosphorylated by Lyn, a Src family tyrosine kinase, which leads to the recruitment of SHP-1, a tyrosine phosphatase, to its cytoplasmic tail. This pathway is important for inhibiting BCR signaling, and SIAE functions in a B cell intrinsic manner to permit this inhibition by CD22 and possibly other Siglecs (Pillai2009Esterases).

In SIAE mutant mice, there is defective CD22 signaling due to increased acetylation, leading to reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of CD22 and impaired recruitment of SHP-1 after BCR ligation. This results in enhanced BCR signal strength (Cariappa2008B). The absence of functional SIAE leads to increased BCR signaling, similar to CD22-null mice, suggesting that SIAE plays a role in modulating BCR signaling through its interaction with sialic acid modifications on Siglec ligands (Cariappa2008B). These interactions are central to SIAE's role in maintaining peripheral B cell tolerance and preventing autoimmunity (Pillai2009Esterases).
