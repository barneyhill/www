# C12orf57

## Overview
C12orf57 is a gene located on chromosome 12 that encodes a protein known as chromosome 12 open reading frame 57. This protein, consisting of 126 amino acids, is ubiquitously expressed in various human tissues, with a significant presence in fetal brain tissue, suggesting its potential involvement in brain development (Akizu2013WholeExome). Although the precise molecular function of the C12orf57 protein remains to be fully elucidated, it is implicated in critical biological processes such as neuron differentiation and development, as well as neuron projection morphogenesis (Borgio2021Heterogeneity). Mutations in the C12orf57 gene are associated with several autosomal recessive disorders, including Temtamy syndrome and syndromic intellectual disability, highlighting its importance in normal neurological and developmental processes (Wang2019Temtamy; Platzer2014Exome).

## Function
The C12orf57 gene encodes a 126-amino acid protein whose precise function in healthy human cells is not fully understood. It is ubiquitously expressed across various human tissues, with a notable abundance in fetal brain tissue, suggesting a potential role in brain development (Akizu2013WholeExome). The gene is located within an evolutionarily conserved gene-rich cluster on chromosome 12 and overlaps with the 3' UTR of the ATN1 gene, although they are separate transcripts (Akizu2013WholeExome).

C12orf57 is implicated in several biological processes, particularly those related to neuron differentiation, neuron development, and neuron projection morphogenesis. It is also involved in central nervous system neuron differentiation and the generation of neurons (Borgio2021Heterogeneity). The gene's expression is particularly significant in neuroepithelial cell lines, indicating active transcription at this locus (Akizu2013WholeExome).

Despite these insights, the specific molecular activities of the C12orf57 protein and its precise role in cellular processes remain unclear. The gene's involvement in developmental disorders, such as corpus callosum hypoplasia and Temtamy syndrome, underscores its importance in normal cellular and organismal function (Akizu2013WholeExome; Wang2019Temtamy).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the C12orf57 gene are associated with several autosomal recessive disorders characterized by neurological and developmental abnormalities. One such condition is Temtamy syndrome, which presents with global developmental delay, epilepsy, and distinctive facial features. This syndrome is linked to pathogenic variants in C12orf57, such as the c.3G>C (p.Met1IIe) mutation, which affects the start codon and disrupts protein translation (Wang2019Temtamy).

C12orf57 mutations also cause a syndromic form of intellectual disability that includes epilepsy, hypoplasia or agenesis of the corpus callosum, and optic coloboma. These mutations often result in significant protein alterations, such as the abolition of the initiation codon or the introduction of premature stop codons, leading to severe intellectual disability and intractable seizures (Platzer2014Exome).

Another condition linked to C12orf57 mutations is colobomatous microphthalmia, characterized by developmental eye disorders and neurological symptoms. Mutations like c.1A>G, which abolish the normal initiation codon, are implicated in this condition, leading to a complete loss of protein function (Zahrani2013Mutations).

These findings underscore the critical role of C12orf57 in normal neurological and visual development, with mutations leading to a spectrum of severe clinical phenotypes (Akizu2013WholeExome).
