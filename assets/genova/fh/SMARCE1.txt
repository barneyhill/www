# SMARCE1

## Overview
SMARCE1 is a gene that encodes the protein SWI/SNF related, matrix associated, actin dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily e, member 1, which is a critical component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. This protein plays a pivotal role in modulating chromatin structure, thereby influencing gene expression, DNA repair, replication, and transcription. As a chromatin remodeler, SMARCE1 is involved in altering chromatin accessibility, facilitating the binding of transcription factors necessary for various cellular processes (Sethuraman2016SMARCE1). The protein is characterized by its high-mobility group (HMG) domain, which allows it to interact with DNA, and a coiled-coil domain that stabilizes interactions within the SWI/SNF complex (St.2022SMARCE1; Wattler1999Cloning). Mutations in the SMARCE1 gene are linked to certain medical conditions, including clear cell meningiomas and Coffin-Siris syndrome, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease (Kosho2014Genotype‐phenotype; Schuermans2023Mother).

## Structure
The SMARCE1 protein is a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex and is characterized by several distinct structural features. It contains an N-terminal high-mobility group (HMG) domain, which is known for its DNA-binding properties, allowing the protein to interact with DNA in a non-specific manner (St.2022SMARCE1; Wattler1999Cloning). This domain is crucial for the protein's function in chromatin remodeling and is shared with related proteins, indicating a conserved role in chromatin assembly (Wattler1999Cloning).

The SMARCE1 protein also features a centrally positioned coiled-coil domain, which contributes to its structural role within the SWI/SNF complex, particularly in stabilizing interactions between the core-ATPase module and other subunits (St.2022SMARCE1). This domain is similar to a leucine zipper structure, consisting of a heptamer repeat (Wattler1999Cloning).

In terms of quaternary structure, SMARCE1 is part of the canonical BAF (cBAF) and polybromo-associated BAF (PBAF) complexes, but not the non-canonical BAF (ncBAF) complex. It plays a critical role in maintaining the integrity of these complexes, particularly the cBAF complex, by linking various subunits and extending towards the nucleosome (St.2022SMARCE1). The protein's structure is suggested to have a 'U-like' configuration within the core module, facilitating its interactions with other subunits (St.2022SMARCE1).

## Function
SMARCE1 is a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, which plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression by altering chromatin structure. This protein is involved in modulating chromatin accessibility, thereby facilitating the binding of transcription factors necessary for DNA repair, replication, and transcription (Sethuraman2016SMARCE1). SMARCE1 is active in the nucleus of cells, where it participates in these essential cellular processes.

In healthy human cells, SMARCE1 is implicated in the regulation of gene expression through its interaction with other components of the SWI/SNF complex. It is involved in chromatin remodeling, which is essential for the proper transcriptional regulation of genes. This function is critical for maintaining normal cellular functions and ensuring the correct expression of genes involved in various biological processes (Sethuraman2016SMARCE1).

While the specific role of SMARCE1 in healthy cells is not extensively detailed in the provided context, its involvement in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation suggests it plays a fundamental role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and normal physiological functions (Sethuraman2016SMARCE1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SMARCE1 gene are associated with clear cell meningiomas (CCMs), a rare and aggressive subtype of meningioma. These tumors are characterized by a high recurrence rate and are classified as WHO Grade II tumors. SMARCE1 mutations lead to the loss of tumor suppressor function, resulting in uncontrolled cell growth and the development of CCMs. These mutations are often germline and result in a hereditary predisposition to CCMs, with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern (Gerkes2016A; Schuermans2023Mother). 

SMARCE1-related meningiomas are particularly associated with familial cases, where multiple family members may develop these tumors, often at a young age. The mutations are typically loss-of-function, such as frameshift and nonsense mutations, which disrupt the gene's normal function (Gerkes2016A). 

In addition to meningiomas, SMARCE1 mutations have been implicated in Coffin-Siris syndrome, a condition characterized by developmental delays and physical abnormalities. However, the mutations associated with Coffin-Siris syndrome are typically missense mutations, which differ from those causing CCMs (Kosho2014Genotype‐phenotype). Genetic screening and regular monitoring are recommended for individuals with a family history of SMARCE1 mutations to facilitate early detection and management of potential tumors (Schuermans2023Mother).

## Interactions
SMARCE1 is a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex and plays a crucial role in its assembly and function. It interacts with the SMARCA4 ATPase and other subunits within the complex, such as ACTL6A, to stabilize the cBAF complex, a subtype of the SWI/SNF complex, particularly upon nucleosome core particle binding (St.2022SMARCE1). SMARCE1 is essential for the stable binding of ARID subunits to the BAF complex, forming a platform for the assembly of fully formed BAF and PBAF complexes (Mashtalir2018Modular). 

In the context of clear cell meningioma, SMARCE1 loss leads to increased abundance and activity of ncBAF complexes, which are not typically associated with SMARCE1. This deficiency results in a unique gene expression signature in tumors and makes SMARCE1-deficient cells more sensitive to small-molecule inhibitors targeting ncBAF complexes (St.2022SMARCE1). 

In mouse embryonic stem cells, SMARCE1 interacts with other BAF complex components like Arid1a, and its presence is necessary for the efficient recruitment of Arid1a. The absence of SMARCE1 alters the BAF complex's distribution, leading to ectopic chromatin remodeling and impaired nucleosome stability (Kashiwagi2022Disruption).
