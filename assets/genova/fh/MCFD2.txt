# MCFD2

## Overview
MCFD2 is a gene that encodes the protein multiple coagulation factor deficiency 2, ER cargo receptor complex subunit, which plays a critical role in the transport of coagulation factors V and VIII. This protein is a soluble component of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) cargo receptor complex and is characterized by its two EF-hand calcium-binding motifs. These motifs are essential for the protein's structural integrity and its interaction with ERGIC-53, a transmembrane lectin involved in glycoprotein transport (Nishio2010Structural; Nyfeler2008Deletion). MCFD2 functions as a recruitment factor, facilitating the efficient secretion of coagulation factors by forming a calcium-dependent complex with ERGIC-53 and LMAN1, another transmembrane protein (Nyfeler2006Cargo; Zheng2013Combined). Mutations in the MCFD2 gene can lead to combined deficiency of coagulation factors V and VIII, a rare autosomal recessive bleeding disorder, underscoring the gene's importance in maintaining normal blood coagulation processes (Latif2014Inherited; Nyfeler2008Deletion).

## Structure
MCFD2 is a soluble protein involved in the transport of coagulation factors V and VIII. It contains two EF-hand calcium-binding motifs, which are crucial for its structural integrity and function. These motifs contribute to the protein's secondary structure, forming a calmodulin-like domain composed of four α-helices (Nishio2010Structural; Nyfeler2008Deletion). The EF-hand domains not only facilitate calcium binding but also play a role in the interaction with ERGIC-53, a transmembrane lectin involved in glycoprotein transport (Nishio2010Structural).

The tertiary structure of MCFD2 is stabilized by calcium ions, which are essential for maintaining its conformation and enabling its interaction with ERGIC-53 (Nishio2010Structural). MCFD2 undergoes significant conformational changes upon binding to ERGIC-53, while ERGIC-53's conformation remains largely unaffected (Nishio2010Structural). This interaction is crucial for the early secretory pathway of coagulation factors V and VIII (Nishio2010Structural).

In terms of quaternary structure, MCFD2 forms a stable 1:1 complex with the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of ERGIC-53, which is essential for its function in glycoprotein transport (Nishio2010Structural). The interaction is calcium-dependent and involves specific contact modes that are critical for the stability of the complex (Nishio2010Structural).

## Function
MCFD2 is a soluble protein located in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is a crucial component of the ER cargo receptor complex. It contains two EF-hand domains and interacts with ERGIC-53, a transmembrane mannose-lectin, in a calcium-dependent manner. This interaction is essential for the transport of blood coagulation factors V and VIII from the ER to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) (Nyfeler2006Cargo; Nyfeler2008Deletion).

MCFD2 functions as a recruitment factor for these coagulation factors, facilitating their efficient secretion. It plays a specific role in the transport of factors V and VIII, acting as a 'cargo capture module' that brings these proteins to the LMAN1-MCFD2 complex in the ER for packaging into COPII vesicles (Zhang2022Separate; Zhu2018Analysis). MCFD2 can interact with factor VIII independently of ERGIC-53, highlighting its significant role in the transport process (Nyfeler2006Cargo).

Mutations in MCFD2 can lead to deficiencies in these coagulation factors, resulting in combined factor V and factor VIII deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive bleeding disorder (Nyfeler2008Deletion). This underscores the importance of MCFD2 in maintaining normal blood coagulation processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MCFD2 gene are associated with combined deficiency of coagulation factors V and VIII (F5F8D), a rare autosomal recessive bleeding disorder. This condition is characterized by mild to moderate bleeding symptoms, including easy bruising, epistaxis, and prolonged bleeding after trauma or surgery (Latif2014Inherited; Zheng2013Combined). The MCFD2 gene encodes a protein that forms a complex with LMAN1, which is crucial for the transport of coagulation factors V and VIII from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. Mutations in MCFD2 disrupt this complex, leading to reduced levels of these coagulation factors in the plasma (Zheng2013Combined; Zhu2018Analysis).

Various mutations in MCFD2, including missense, nonsense, and splice site mutations, have been identified. These mutations often result in the complete loss of protein function, contributing to the pathogenesis of F5F8D (Zheng2013Combined). Specific missense mutations, such as D81H and D89N, affect calcium ion coordination, leading to structural collapse of the protein and impaired interaction with LMAN1 (Zheng2013Combined). The disruption of MCFD2's function affects the secretion and regulation of coagulation factors, highlighting its clinical significance in bleeding disorders (Nyfeler2008Deletion).

## Interactions
MCFD2 interacts with the transmembrane protein LMAN1 to form a Ca2+-dependent complex that is crucial for the transport of coagulation factors V and VIII from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus. This interaction is essential for the secretion of these factors, and mutations in either MCFD2 or LMAN1 can lead to combined deficiency of coagulation factors V and VIII (F5F8D) (Zheng2013Combined). The EF-hand domains of MCFD2 are necessary for binding to LMAN1, and the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of LMAN1 is responsible for MCFD2 binding (Zheng2013Combined).

MCFD2 also interacts with ERGIC-53, a membrane lectin, forming a complex that is essential for the transport of factors V and VIII. This interaction is calcium-dependent and occurs in the early secretory pathway, specifically in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) (Nyfeler2006Cargo). MCFD2 is retained by ERGIC-53, and overexpression of MCFD2 can lead to its secretion, indicating a saturation of ERGIC-53's retention capacity (Nyfeler2006Cargo).

MCFD2 can interact with factor VIII independently of ERGIC-53, but not with other glycoproteins like cathepsin Z or C, which bind to ERGIC-53 independently of MCFD2 (Nyfeler2006Cargo).
