# LIPC

## Overview
The LIPC gene encodes the enzyme hepatic lipase, a critical component in lipid metabolism. Hepatic lipase is a glycoprotein enzyme primarily produced in the liver, where it is involved in the hydrolysis of triglycerides and phospholipids in lipoproteins. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the conversion of very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) to intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL) and low-density lipoproteins (LDL), as well as in the remodeling of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles, which is essential for reverse cholesterol transport (Sanan1997Hepatic; Deeb2000The). Hepatic lipase functions as a ligand or bridging factor for receptor-mediated lipoprotein uptake, facilitating the cellular uptake of remnant lipoproteins and maintaining lipid homeostasis (Ji1994Enhanced; Neale2010Genome-wide). Variants in the LIPC gene have been associated with various lipid metabolism disorders and cardiovascular diseases, underscoring its clinical significance (Zhang2006Genetic; Balanescu2022Hypertriglyceridemia).

## Structure


## Function
The LIPC gene encodes hepatic lipase, a glycoprotein enzyme that plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism. Hepatic lipase is primarily synthesized and secreted by the liver, where it is bound to heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the surfaces of sinusoidal endothelial cells and hepatocytes (Deeb2000The). This enzyme is involved in the hydrolysis of triglycerides and phospholipids in lipoproteins, facilitating the conversion of very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) to intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL) and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) (Sanan1997Hepatic). It also plays a role in the remodeling of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) by converting large, triglyceride-rich HDL2 to smaller, denser HDL3 particles, which is essential for reverse cholesterol transport (Liao2021Functional; Deeb2000The).

Hepatic lipase enhances the binding and uptake of remnant lipoproteins by interacting with cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans, which is crucial for maintaining lipid homeostasis (Ji1994Enhanced). The enzyme's activity is associated with the heparan sulfate proteoglycan/LDL receptor-related protein pathway, and its absence can lead to the accumulation of remnant lipoproteins, highlighting its importance in lipid metabolism (Sanan1997Hepatic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the LIPC gene, which encodes hepatic lipase, have significant clinical implications. Variants in LIPC can lead to hepatic lipase deficiency, a rare condition that results in disorders of lipid metabolism, such as hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia. This can cause acute pancreatitis, as seen in a pediatric case where a novel LIPC variant led to severe hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis (Balanescu2022Hypertriglyceridemia).

LIPC gene variants are also associated with cardiovascular diseases. For instance, the LIPC C(-514)T polymorphism has been linked to coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, with obesity modulating this risk. In obese individuals, the CT or TT genotype increases CHD risk, while in lean individuals, it reduces risk (Zhang2006Genetic). Additionally, the T202T variant is associated with lower HDL cholesterol and higher triglyceride levels, contributing to coronary artery disease progression (Baroni2003Genetic).

LIPC polymorphisms are implicated in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). A significant association between the LIPC locus and AMD suggests that LIPC variants may influence AMD risk through mechanisms involving cholesterol pathways and oxidative stress (Neale2010Genome-wide). These findings highlight the gene's role in various lipid-related disorders and its potential impact on disease risk.

## Interactions
The LIPC gene encodes hepatic lipase, an enzyme that plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism. Hepatic lipase is involved in the hydrolysis of triglycerides and phospholipids in plasma lipoproteins, contributing to the formation of small dense LDL and HDL3-C particles (Xiao2012Association). It acts as a ligand or bridging factor for receptor-mediated lipoprotein uptake, facilitating the cellular uptake of remnant lipoproteins (Neale2010Genome-wide).

LIPC interacts with various proteins involved in lipid transport and processing. It is suggested to interact with the ABCA1 transporter and apoA1, which are involved in lipid transport processes in the retina (Neale2010Genome-wide). The interaction between LIPC and HMGCR, a gene involved in cholesterol synthesis, has been identified as affecting HDL cholesterol content through interactions with LDL and triglyceride-rich particles (Ma2012KnowledgeDriven).

The LIPC gene is also part of a gene-gene interaction network that regulates HDL cholesterol levels, potentially acting as a hub through interactions with other genes related to lipid metabolism (Ma2014Analysis). These interactions highlight the complex role of LIPC in lipid metabolism and its potential impact on various health conditions.
