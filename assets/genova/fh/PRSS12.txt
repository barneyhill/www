# PRSS12

## Overview
The PRSS12 gene encodes the protein serine protease 12, commonly referred to as motopsin or neurotrypsin, which is a serine protease predominantly expressed in the central nervous system. This enzyme is characterized by its multi-domain structure, including a signal peptide, proline-rich domain, kringle domain, scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domains, and a protease domain, which facilitate its interactions with various molecular partners (Mitsui2013Mental; Mitsui2013A). Motopsin plays a critical role in neural development and synaptic plasticity by modulating the extracellular matrix and influencing synapse formation and maintenance through its proteolytic activity (Saleha2017Genetic). It is involved in cleaving the proteoglycan agrin and interacts with proteins such as seizure-related gene 6 (sez-6) and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), underscoring its importance in cognitive functions and brain development (Mitsui2007Enzymatic; Mitsui2013A). Mutations in PRSS12 have been associated with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic mental retardation and sarcopenia-related phenotypes, highlighting its clinical significance in both neurological and muscular health (Babar2011Molecular; Pratt2023Genes).

## Structure
The PRSS12 gene encodes the protein motopsin, also known as neurotrypsin, which is a serine protease secreted by neuronal cells in various brain regions. The molecular structure of motopsin is characterized by a mosaic of domains, including a signal peptide, a proline-rich domain, a kringle domain, three scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domains, and a protease domain at the C-terminal (Mitsui2013Mental; Mitsui2013A). This multi-domain structure suggests that motopsin can interact with other molecules through these domains, playing a role in cognitive function and brain development (Mitsui2013A).

Motopsin is involved in cleaving the proteoglycan agrin, which is important for synapse formation and maintenance (Mitsui2013A). The protein is secreted in an activity-dependent manner from neuronal cells (Mitsui2013A). The interaction of motopsin with seizure-related gene 6 (sez-6) has been identified, where sez-6 binds to the proline-rich/kringle domain of motopsin, affecting neurite outgrowth and branching (Mitsui2013A). Motopsin also interacts with the integral membrane protein 2a (Itm2a) through the BRICHOS domain, significant during early postnatal brain development (Mitsui2013Mental).

## Function
The PRSS12 gene encodes a serine protease known as motopsin, which plays a crucial role in neural development and synaptic plasticity. In healthy human cells, motopsin is involved in proteolytic processes within the extracellular matrix, influencing learning and memory by modulating neuronal connections (Saleha2017Genetic). It is secreted by neuronal cells and is active in various brain regions, including the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, where it contributes to cognitive functions (Mitsui2013Mental).

Motopsin is involved in cleaving the proteoglycan agrin, which is essential for synapse formation and maintenance, indicating its role in synaptic plasticity and neuronal morphology (Mitsui2013A). The protein's structure includes domains that suggest interactions with other molecules, such as seizure-related gene 6 (sez-6), which modulates neuronal cell morphology and synaptogenesis (Mitsui2013A). Motopsin also interacts with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), enhancing its activity and suggesting a role in tissue remodeling processes (Mitsui2007Enzymatic).

The expression of motopsin peaks around the second week after birth, aligning with critical periods of brain development, and decreases over a lifetime, highlighting its involvement in early cerebral cortex development (Mitsui2013Mental).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PRSS12 gene, also known as neurotrypsin, have been linked to autosomal recessive nonsyndromic mental retardation (ARNSMR). This condition is characterized by intellectual disabilities without other syndromic features. The PRSS12 gene is one of four genes identified to cause ARNSMR, with the others being CRBN, CC2D1A, and GRIK2. These genes are involved in pathways such as synaptic proteolysis and mitochondrial energy metabolism, which are crucial for normal cognitive function (Babar2011Molecular).

Alterations in the expression of PRSS12 have also been associated with sarcopenia-related phenotypes, particularly affecting muscle mass and strength. The gene encodes neurotrypsin, which is involved in the degradation of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). Variants in PRSS12, such as rs71608359, have been linked to decreased grip strength, suggesting a role in muscle function during aging. This association is supported by evidence of neurotrypsin overexpression leading to NMJ fragmentation and sarcopenia in animal models (Pratt2023Genes).

Overall, PRSS12 mutations and expression alterations can impact both cognitive and muscular health, highlighting its clinical significance in neurological and age-related muscular conditions.

## Interactions
PRSS12, also known as motopsin or neurotrypsin, is a serine protease that engages in several protein interactions critical for its function in the central nervous system. One significant interaction is with the integral membrane protein 2a (Itm2a). This interaction is mediated by the BRICHOS domain of Itm2a, as identified through a yeast two-hybrid system. The interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation from lysates of transfected COS cells, indicating a physical association between motopsin and Itm2a (Mitsui2013Mental).

Motopsin also interacts with the extracellular matrix protein agrin, which is essential for synapse formation and maintenance. This interaction suggests a role for motopsin in synaptic plasticity and neuromuscular junction development (Mitsui2013Mental).

Additionally, motopsin has been shown to activate the tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) precursor by cleaving its activation site, thereby increasing tPA activity. This interaction highlights motopsin's role in proteolytic activation processes within the brain (Mitsui2007Enzymatic). These interactions underscore the importance of PRSS12 in maintaining neuronal function and plasticity.
