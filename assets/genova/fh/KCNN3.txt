# KCNN3

## Overview
The KCNN3 gene encodes the protein potassium calcium-activated channel subfamily N member 3, also known as SK3, which is a small-conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channel. This protein is characterized by its six transmembrane domains and a calmodulin-binding domain, which are essential for its function as a calcium-dependent ion channel (Pedarzani2008Molecular; Köhler1996SmallConductance). As a transmembrane protein, SK3 plays a pivotal role in regulating neuronal excitability and muscle contraction by modulating potassium ion flow in response to intracellular calcium levels (Gripp2021Syndromic). The KCNN3 gene is subject to alternative splicing and contains variable CAG repeats, which have been investigated in the context of neurological disorders (Pedarzani2008Molecular; Stocker2004Ca2+activated). Clinically, mutations and expression changes in KCNN3 are associated with cardiac conditions such as atrial fibrillation, highlighting its significance in cardiac electrophysiology and potential as a therapeutic target (Rahm2021HDAC2dependent; Ellinor2010Common).

## Structure
The KCNN3 gene encodes a protein that is part of the small-conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channel family, specifically the KCa2.3 subunit. This protein consists of six transmembrane domains (S1-S6) with a pore-forming loop between the S5 and S6 segments, similar to voltage-gated potassium channels (Pedarzani2008Molecular; Köhler1996SmallConductance). The protein's structure includes a calmodulin (CaM) binding domain (CaMBD) located adjacent to the S6 segment, which is crucial for its calcium-dependent gating mechanism (Stocker2004Ca2+activated). 

The KCNN3 protein forms tetrameric structures, with each subunit binding to calmodulin in a Ca2+-independent manner, allowing the channel to be highly sensitive to calcium (Stocker2004Ca2+activated). The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can regulate its activity (Köhler1996SmallConductance). 

Alternative splicing of the KCNN3 gene results in isoforms with variations in the N-terminal region, although the functional consequences of these variants are not fully understood (Stocker2004Ca2+activated). The KCNN3 gene also contains CAG repeats, which can vary in length and have been studied in the context of neurological disorders (Pedarzani2008Molecular).

## Function
The KCNN3 gene encodes the small conductance calcium-activated potassium channel SK3, which plays a crucial role in regulating neuronal excitability and muscle contraction by controlling the flow of potassium ions in response to intracellular calcium levels (Gripp2021Syndromic). In healthy human cells, SK3 channels are activated by low levels of intracellular calcium, contributing to the regulation of cellular excitability and signal transduction (Gripp2021Syndromic). These channels are part of a multiprotein complex that includes the pore-forming channel subunits, the constitutively bound calcium sensor calmodulin, protein kinase CK2, and protein phosphatase 2A (Gripp2021Syndromic).

The function of SK3 channels is particularly important in neurons, where they help control action potentials and maintain excitation homeostasis, thereby influencing synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter release (Grube2011A). This regulation is essential for maintaining the proper electrical activity of cells, ensuring that neuronal firing patterns and synaptic functions are appropriately modulated (Gripp2021Syndromic). The KCNN3 gene's role in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining normal cognitive and physiological functions in healthy individuals.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the KCNN3 gene, which encodes the SK3 channel, have been associated with various cardiac conditions. Variants in KCNN3 are linked to an increased risk of lone atrial fibrillation (AF), a common arrhythmia characterized by the absence of overt heart disease. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs13376333 at the 1q21 locus is notably associated with lone AF, suggesting KCNN3 as a potential therapeutic target for AF treatment (Ellinor2010Common). 

In patients with paroxysmal and chronic AF, KCNN3 mRNA expression is significantly reduced, indicating a role in the pathophysiology of AF and heart failure (Rahm2021HDAC2dependent). Overexpression of KCNN3 in mice has been linked to sudden cardiac death due to heart block and bradyarrhythmias, highlighting the critical role of KCNN3 in cardiac electrophysiology (Mahida2013Overexpression). 

The gene's expression is also implicated in the remodeling of potassium channels in AF with concomitant heart failure, with HDAC2-dependent pathways potentially regulating KCNN3 expression (Rahm2021HDAC2dependent). These findings underscore the clinical significance of KCNN3 in cardiac arrhythmias and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
The KCNN3 gene encodes the small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel SK3, which is involved in various protein interactions. SK3 forms a homomeric tetramer and interacts with calmodulin (CaM), a necessary component for its activation. Despite gain-of-function mutations, such as p.Val450Leu, these do not significantly affect the complex formation between KCNN3 and CaM (Bauer2019GainofFunction).

In midbrain dopaminergic neurons, SK3 interacts with several proteins, including the sclerosis tuberous complex (Tsc) proteins Tsc1 and Tsc2, which are inhibitors of the mTOR kinase. Tsc1 is identified as a significant binding partner of the SK3 complex (Belghazi2024HighResolution). SK3 also associates with calcium-related proteins, such as the α1 subunit of the R-type voltage-dependent calcium channel (Cav2.3) and α2δ1 subunits, as well as the Cask protein, a member of the CAMKII family (Belghazi2024HighResolution).

SK3 is part of a macromolecular complex involving Cav1.3 and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, which are crucial for pacemaking activity in neurons (Belghazi2024HighResolution). These interactions highlight the role of SK3 in regulating neuronal excitability and its involvement in complex signaling pathways.
