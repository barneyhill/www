# RSPRY1

## Overview
RSPRY1 is a gene that encodes the protein ring finger and SPRY domain containing 1, which is characterized by the presence of a RING finger domain and a SPRY domain. This protein is involved in protein-protein interactions and ubiquitination processes, suggesting its role as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The RING finger domain is typically associated with the transfer of ubiquitin to target proteins, influencing their degradation, signaling, or localization, while the SPRY domain is implicated in signal transduction and immune responses (Waddell2016Isolation; von2015The). RSPRY1 is highly conserved across species, indicating its evolutionary importance, and is expressed in skeletal muscle cells, where it may play a role in muscle differentiation and response to neurogenic atrophy (Waddell2016Isolation). Mutations in RSPRY1 have been linked to skeletal dysplasia, highlighting its significance in bone development and growth (Goos2018Genetic; Costantini2021New).

## Structure
The RSPRY1 protein in humans is characterized by the presence of a RING finger domain and a SPRY domain. The RING finger domain, spanning amino acids 526-565, is typically involved in protein-protein interactions and is a common feature in E3 ubiquitin ligases, suggesting a role in ubiquitination processes (Waddell2016Isolation; von2015The). The SPRY domain, also known as the B30.2 domain, spans amino acids 359-479 and is known for its role in protein-protein interactions (Waddell2016Isolation). The protein is highly conserved across species, with a 97% amino acid identity between human, mouse, and rat RSPRY1, indicating its evolutionary importance (Waddell2016Isolation).

The RSPRY1 protein is predicted to have a molecular weight of approximately 64 kDa and consists of 576 amino acids in mice, which is likely similar in humans (Waddell2016Isolation). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination, which aligns with its potential involvement in proteasome activity and/or assembly (Waddell2016Isolation). The presence of splice variant isoforms could potentially alter the protein's function or localization, although specific isoforms are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
RSPRY1 encodes a protein characterized by the presence of a RING finger and a SPRY domain, which are indicative of its involvement in protein-protein interactions and ubiquitination processes. The RING finger domain is typically associated with the transfer of ubiquitin to target proteins, a process that can influence protein degradation, signaling, or localization, thereby playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Waddell2016Isolation; von2015The). The SPRY domain is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and immune responses, suggesting that RSPRY1 may have a role in these pathways as well (von2015The).

In skeletal muscle cells, RSPRY1 is localized to the cytoplasm, as demonstrated by confocal fluorescent microscopy studies using GFP-tagged RSPRY1 (Waddell2016Isolation). The expression of RSPRY1 is observed at both RNA and protein levels in muscle tissue, and its expression increases in response to neurogenic atrophy, although this increase is not statistically significant (Waddell2016Isolation). The protein's activity is crucial for muscle cell biology, potentially through interactions facilitated by its conserved domains, and it may play a role in early muscle differentiation (Waddell2016Isolation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RSPRY1 gene have been associated with a skeletal dysplasia phenotype. In a consanguineous Saudi family, four siblings exhibited a homozygous 1-bp duplication in RSPRY1, leading to a frameshift and premature truncation of the protein. This mutation resulted in a range of symptoms, including progressive spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, short stature, microcephaly, facial dysmorphisms, intellectual disability, delayed motor development, generalized hypotonia, and craniosynostosis (Goos2018Genetic). A similar mutation was identified in an unrelated Peruvian individual, who displayed a comparable phenotype but without craniosynostosis (Goos2018Genetic).

The RSPRY1 gene is also mentioned in the context of skeletal diseases characterized by reduced linear growth, specifically spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia (SEMD), with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern (Costantini2021New). Although the specific clinical significance of RSPRY1 mutations in other conditions is not well-documented, its involvement in skeletal dysplasia suggests a critical role in bone development and growth. The gene's expression in skeletal muscle and its response to neurogenic atrophy have been studied, but the clinical implications of these findings remain unclear (Waddell2016Isolation).

## Interactions
RSPRY1, a protein characterized by the presence of a RING finger and SPRY domain, is involved in various cellular interactions. The RING finger domain is typically associated with ubiquitination processes, suggesting a role in protein-protein interactions. Although specific interactions of RSPRY1 with other proteins are not detailed extensively, it has been implicated in ubiquitination pathways. A study identified RSPRY1 as a potential substrate for ubiquitination by the Smurf1 ubiquitin ligase, indicating its involvement in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Andrews2010Identification).

In the context of viral infections, RSPRY1 has been shown to interact with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural 2 (NS2) protein. A proteomic screen identified RSPRY1 as one of the ubiquitin signaling proteins interacting with NS2. The depletion of RSPRY1 was found to increase HCV infection, suggesting that it may act as an antiviral factor (Kumar2019MARCH8).

While the specific physical interactions of RSPRY1 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not comprehensively detailed, its involvement in ubiquitination and potential antiviral roles highlight its significance in cellular processes.
