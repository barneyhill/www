# MAST1

## Overview
MAST1, or microtubule associated serine/threonine kinase 1, is a gene that encodes a protein kinase involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics and cellular signaling pathways. The protein product of MAST1 is categorized as a serine/threonine kinase, which is part of the AGC kinase family, and plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including structural organization and signaling within the central nervous system. MAST1 is known for its interactions with proteins such as β2-syntrophin and PTEN, linking the dystrophin complex with the microtubule network and influencing cellular homeostasis. Its involvement in presynaptic mechanisms and neurotransmitter release highlights its significance in neuronal signaling. Mutations in the MAST1 gene have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and certain cancers, underscoring its clinical relevance (Tripathy2018Mutations; Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated).

## Function
MAST1 (microtubule associated serine/threonine kinase 1) is a protein kinase involved in various cellular processes, primarily through its role in regulating microtubule dynamics and cellular signaling pathways. It is part of the AGC kinase family and contains a conserved serine/threonine kinase domain, which is crucial for its kinase activity, as well as a PDZ domain that facilitates protein-protein interactions (Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated). MAST1 is broadly expressed in the central nervous system and is involved in cellular signaling and structural organization, potentially linking the dystrophin complex with the microtubule network through its interaction with β2-syntrophin (Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated).

In healthy human cells, MAST1 interacts with the tumor suppressor protein PTEN, influencing its activity and stability. This interaction is significant in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating cell growth and survival (Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated). MAST1 is also implicated in presynaptic mechanisms and neurotransmitter release, suggesting a role in neuronal signaling (Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated). While specific functions in healthy cells are not fully detailed, MAST1's involvement in these processes indicates its importance in maintaining cellular structure and function, impacting processes like cell motility and neuronal signaling.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MAST1 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, most notably mega-corpus-callosum syndrome with cerebellar hypoplasia and cortical malformations (MCC-CH-CM). This condition is characterized by an enlarged corpus callosum, cerebellar hypoplasia, and cortical malformations, and is primarily caused by de novo mutations in MAST1 (Tripathy2018Mutations). Specific mutations, such as L278del, have been shown to lead to increased neuronal apoptosis and structural brain abnormalities, contributing to the clinical manifestations of MCC-CH-CM (Tripathy2018Mutations; Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated).

MAST1 mutations have also been linked to other neurodevelopmental conditions, including severe autism, microcephaly, and cerebral palsy (Tripathy2018Mutations). In addition, a missense variant in MAST1 has been associated with intellectual disability and cerebellar hypoplasia in patients with Rett syndrome-like phenotypes (Iwama2019Genetic).

Beyond neurological disorders, MAST1 has been implicated in cancer. MAST1 gene fusions and upregulated circular RNA have been identified in breast and liver cancers, respectively, suggesting a role in tumor growth and as a potential diagnostic marker (Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated). MAST1 is also considered a candidate gene for familial lung cancer (Tomoshige2015Germline).

## Interactions
MAST1, a microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinase, engages in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. MAST1 binds to β2-syntrophin, a component of the dystrophin/utrophin network at neuromuscular synapses, through PDZ domain interactions. This suggests a role in linking the dystrophin complex with the microtubule network (Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated).

MAST1 also interacts with several proteins involved in the ERK signaling pathway, including MEK1 and c-Raf. In the presence of cisplatin, MAST1 remains bound to MEK1, leading to its activation through phosphorylation, while c-Raf dissociates from the complex (Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated).

In the context of cancer, MAST1 forms a complex with the chaperone protein hsp90B and the E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP. Hsp90B stabilizes MAST1 by preventing its ubiquitination and degradation by CHIP, which is significant for maintaining MAST1 levels and contributing to cisplatin resistance in cancer cells (Pan2019Hsp90B). This interaction is a potential target for enhancing cisplatin sensitivity in cancer therapy (Pan2019Hsp90B). 

MAST1's transcription is upregulated by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in response to cisplatin, which binds to the glucocorticoid response element within the MAST1 promoter, enhancing its expression (Pan2021Cisplatinmediated).
