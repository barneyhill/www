# GPHA2

## Overview
The GPHA2 gene encodes the glycoprotein hormone subunit alpha 2, a component of the glycoprotein hormone family. This protein is integral to the formation of heterodimeric glycoprotein hormones, such as thyrostimulin, through its interaction with specific beta subunits like GPB5. These hormones are involved in activating the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR), which is essential for thyroid function and metabolism regulation (Querat2021Unconventional; Suzuki2007The). GPHA2 is predominantly expressed in the pancreas and anterior pituitary, suggesting a role in endocrine processes (Suzuki2007The). Despite its involvement in hormone formation, the precise physiological roles of GPHA2 remain incompletely understood, as genetic studies indicate that its overexpression or disruption does not result in significant phenotypic changes (Suzuki2007The). Additionally, GPHA2 is recognized as a marker for limbal progenitor cells in the cornea, highlighting its potential role in maintaining cellular undifferentiation (Collin2020A; Collin2021A).

## Function
The GPHA2 gene encodes the glycoprotein hormone alpha subunit type 2, which is part of the glycoprotein hormone family. This protein is involved in forming heterodimeric glycoprotein hormones, such as thyrostimulin, by combining with specific beta subunits like GPB5. These hormones play a role in activating the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR), which is crucial for stimulating T4 secretion from the thyroid gland (Querat2021Unconventional; Suzuki2007The).

In healthy human cells, the GPHA2 protein is expressed in the pancreas and anterior pituitary, with the highest expression levels observed in these tissues. It is involved in endocrine functions, potentially influencing processes like metabolism and growth (Suzuki2007The). The transcriptional regulation of GPHA2 involves the LIM homeodomain transcription factor isl-1, which positively regulates its promoter activity, indicating a role in the development of endocrine tissues (Suzuki2007The).

Despite its involvement in forming thyrostimulin, the physiological roles of GPHA2 remain not fully characterized, as genetic studies have shown that neither overexpression nor disruption of GPA2 results in significant phenotypes, suggesting it may not be critical for embryogenesis, development, or reproduction (Suzuki2007The).

## Interactions
GPHA2, or glycoprotein hormone subunit alpha 2, is involved in forming heterodimeric glycoprotein hormones by interacting with specific beta subunits. In the context of the elephant shark, GPHA2 does not activate receptors when co-expressed with any beta subunits, including its vertebrate partner GpHB5, suggesting a lack of physical interaction that leads to receptor activation (Buechi2017Evolution). The GPHA2 subunit interacts with all beta hormone subunits through a conserved region at the GpHa-GpHb interface known as the 'seat', which is crucial for the stability and specificity of hormone-receptor interactions (Buechi2017Evolution). However, the GPB5 subunit lacks the 'seatbelt' and cysteine residues necessary for stable heterodimer formation, which may explain the absence of stable interactions between GPHA2 and GPB5 (Cahoreau2015Structureâ€“Function).

In humans, GPHA2 is identified as a marker for limbal progenitor cells (LPCs) in the cornea, where it is associated with maintaining an undifferentiated state. However, specific physical interactions of GPHA2 with other proteins or nucleic acids in this context are not detailed (Collin2020A; Collin2021A).
