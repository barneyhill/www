# CDH18

## Overview
CDH18 is a gene that encodes the protein cadherin 18, a member of the cadherin superfamily, which is characterized by its role in calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion. Cadherin 18 is classified as a type II classical cadherin, distinguished by its lack of a HAV cell adhesion recognition sequence. This protein is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system and the fetal epicardium, where it plays a critical role in neural development and cardiac tissue differentiation, respectively. Through its interactions with various intracellular partners, cadherin 18 is involved in essential signaling pathways that regulate cellular processes such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and cell migration. The gene's expression and function have significant implications in developmental biology and disease, particularly in the context of cancer therapy and metabolic disorders (Klein2018PDLIM7; Junghof2022CDH18).

## Function
CDH18, or cadherin 18, is a type II classical cadherin involved in calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion, playing a crucial role in maintaining tissue integrity and cellular communication. It is primarily expressed in the central nervous system, where it contributes to neural development, including axon growth, neuron migration, and synaptic formation (Liu2024Identification; Schlicht2019The). CDH18 is also expressed in the fetal epicardium, where it regulates the differentiation of epicardial-derived cells towards vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) through the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Junghof2022CDH18).

In the epicardium, CDH18 interacts with β-catenin, a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway, to maintain epicardial identity and promote EMT, which is essential for the differentiation into SMCs (Junghof2022CDH18). The gene's expression is regulated by the transcription factor GATA4, which is crucial for epicardiogenesis and maintaining the active epicardium (Junghof2022CDH18). CDH18's role in the epicardium is significant for cardiac development and regeneration, as it helps define epicardial lineage specification and regulates downstream signaling pathways (Junghof2022CDH18).

## Clinical Significance
The CDH18 gene has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to mutations, alterations in expression levels, or changes in its interactions. Genetic variations at the CDH18 locus have been associated with metabolic coherence (MC) of human transcriptomes, suggesting a role in metabolic processes. These variations have been linked to conditions such as leprosy, age-related hearing impairment, blood pressure-related traits in African-Americans, and obesity in adult survivors of childhood cancer, indicating potential impacts on body composition and metabolic consequences (Schlicht2019The).

In the context of cancer treatment, CDH18 expression levels have been shown to influence the effectiveness of CDK4/6 inhibitor therapies. Higher expression of CDH18 correlates with the ability of cells to undergo senescence following CDK4/6 inhibition. This is particularly relevant in well-differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcoma (WD/DDLS) patients treated with palbociclib, where CDH18-positive tumors are associated with improved progression-free survival and overall survival. CDH18's role in regulating MDM2 turnover during therapy-induced senescence highlights its potential as a biomarker for predicting response to CDK4/6 inhibitors (Klein2018PDLIM7). These findings underscore the clinical significance of CDH18 in both metabolic and cancer-related contexts.

## Interactions
CDH18, a type II classical cadherin, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. One significant interaction is with PDLIM7, where CDH18 sequesters PDLIM7 in a complex, which is essential for the regulation of MDM2 turnover during CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy-induced senescence. This interaction is serum-dependent and plays a role in the senescence process in cancer cells treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors like palbociclib (Klein2018PDLIM7). The physical interaction between CDH18 and PDLIM7 has been confirmed through coimmunofluorescence and proximity ligation assays, indicating that these proteins are within 40 nm of each other in cytoplasmic foci in LS8817 cells (Klein2018PDLIM7).

CDH18 is also noted for its interactions with intracellular signaling partners, such as the serine-threonine kinase TAO2b and the actin regulatory complex Nap1/WAVE1, suggesting its involvement in intracellular signaling pathways (Sotomayor2014Sorting). These interactions highlight CDH18's role in cellular adhesion and signaling, contributing to its function in various physiological and pathological contexts.
