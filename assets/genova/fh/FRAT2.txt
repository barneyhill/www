# FRAT2

## Overview
FRAT2 (Frequently Rearranged in Advanced T-cell lymphomas 2) is a gene that encodes the FRAT regulator of WNT signaling pathway 2 protein, which is a crucial component of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This pathway is integral to various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. The FRAT2 protein functions as a positive regulator by inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), thereby preventing the degradation of β-catenin and facilitating its role in gene transcription regulation. Although not essential for Wnt/β-catenin signaling in mice, FRAT2 modulates this pathway, adding a layer of regulatory complexity. The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences GSK-3 activity. FRAT2's interactions with other proteins, such as TMEM98 and FRAT1, further underscore its role in cellular signaling and cancer progression, particularly in gastric cancer, where its expression is linked to tumor invasion and metastasis (Tang2022The; Franca-Koh2002The; van2020TMEM98).

## Function
FRAT2 (Frequently Rearranged in Advanced T-cell lymphomas 2) is a protein that plays a significant role in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. In healthy human cells, FRAT2 acts as a positive regulator of this pathway by inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), a key enzyme that normally promotes the degradation of β-catenin. By binding to GSK-3, FRAT2 prevents the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of β-catenin, allowing β-catenin to accumulate in the cytoplasm and translocate to the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, β-catenin interacts with TCF/LEF transcription factors to modulate the expression of target genes involved in cell growth and development (van2020TMEM98).

FRAT2 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells, where it influences the localization and activity of GSK-3, thereby impacting the Wnt signaling pathway (Franca-Koh2002The). Although FRAT2 is not essential for Wnt/β-catenin signaling in mice, it serves as a modulator, adding a layer of regulation to this critical signaling pathway (van2020TMEM98).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FRAT2 gene are associated with the progression and metastasis of gastric cancer (GC). FRAT2, along with FRAT1, is involved in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for cancer progression. Overexpression of FRAT1 and FRAT2 promotes invasion and metastasis in GC cells, while their downregulation inhibits these processes (Tang2022The). The interaction between FRAT1 and FRAT2 enhances the metastatic potential of GC cells by increasing the expression of metastatic markers such as MMP2 and MMP9 (Tang2022The).

The miR-3648/FRAT1-FRAT2/c-Myc negative feedback loop plays a significant role in modulating GC cell metastasis and invasion. miR-3648 acts as a tumor suppressor by targeting FRAT1 and FRAT2, leading to their downregulation and subsequent inhibition of GC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Tang2022The). The expression levels of FRAT1, FRAT2, and c-Myc are significantly correlated with GC lymph node metastasis and TNM stage, indicating their clinical significance in the disease's progression (Tang2022The). These findings suggest that FRAT2, through its interactions and expression levels, is a critical factor in the metastasis and invasion of gastric cancer cells.

## Interactions
FRAT2 is known to physically interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. It binds to TMEM98, a putative transmembrane protein, which acts as a negative regulator of FRAT2-mediated signaling. This interaction leads to a reduction in FRAT2 protein levels and its signaling activity, suggesting a regulatory mechanism where TMEM98 inhibits FRAT2-induced CTNNB1/TCF signaling (van2020TMEM98; van2019TMEM98). The binding domain of TMEM98 with FRAT2 is located in the C-terminal half of TMEM98, specifically between amino acids 109-217 (van2020TMEM98).

FRAT2 also interacts with FRAT1, another member of the FRAT protein family. This interaction has been shown to promote tumor invasion and metastasis in gastric cancer cells, indicating a synergistic effect between FRAT1 and FRAT2 in enhancing cancerous properties (Tang2022The). The interaction between FRAT1 and FRAT2 was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, demonstrating a physical association between these two proteins (Tang2022The). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory roles of FRAT2 in cellular signaling and cancer progression.
