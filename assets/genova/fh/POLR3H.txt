# POLR3H

## Overview
POLR3H is a gene that encodes the RNA polymerase III subunit H, a component of the RNA polymerase III complex, which is essential for the transcription of small non-coding RNAs, including tRNA and 5S rRNA, in eukaryotic cells. This protein plays a critical role in the assembly and stability of the polymerase complex, thereby facilitating the transcription of molecules necessary for protein synthesis and various cellular functions (Yeganeh2020RNA). POLR3H is expressed ubiquitously, with notable expression in reproductive tissues such as oocytes and developing spermatogonia, underscoring its importance in reproductive health (Franca2019Exome). Additionally, the RNA polymerase III complex, including POLR3H, functions as a DNA sensor in the innate immune response, highlighting its role in detecting and responding to intracellular pathogens (Franca2019Exome). Mutations in POLR3H have been implicated in primary ovarian insufficiency, demonstrating its clinical significance in reproductive disorders (Franca2019Exome).

## Function
POLR3H encodes a subunit of RNA polymerase III, an enzyme complex responsible for transcribing small non-coding RNAs, such as tRNA and 5S rRNA, in eukaryotic cells. This subunit is crucial for the assembly and stability of the polymerase complex, facilitating the transcription of essential components for protein synthesis and cellular function (Yeganeh2020RNA). POLR3H is ubiquitously expressed, with preferential expression in oocytes, ovarian granulosa cells, and developing spermatogonia in mice, indicating its significant role in reproductive tissues (Franca2019Exome).

In healthy human cells, POLR3H, as part of the RNA polymerase III complex, plays a vital role in the transcription of small RNAs that are crucial for various cellular processes, including protein synthesis and the regulation of the cell cycle, cell growth, and differentiation (Franca2019Exome). The enzyme also acts as a nuclear and cytosolic DNA sensor involved in innate immune responses, highlighting its role in sensing and limiting infections by intracellular bacteria and DNA viruses (Franca2019Exome). The activity of POLR3H and its associated complex is essential for maintaining normal cellular and organismal functions, particularly in the context of reproductive health and development (Franca2019Exome).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the POLR3H gene have been identified as a novel cause of primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), a condition characterized by the loss of normal ovarian function before the age of 40. A specific homozygous missense mutation, c.149A>G; p.Asp50Gly, has been found in patients from two unrelated consanguineous families, leading to symptoms such as amenorrhea, hypoestrogenism, and elevated gonadotropin levels (Franca2019Exome). This mutation is rare, as it was absent in Brazilian controls and other public databases (Franca2019Exome).

In mouse models, the Polr3h D50G mutation resulted in delayed puberty and decreased fertility, mirroring the human condition. These mice exhibited reduced expression of ovarian Foxo3a and fewer primary follicles compared to wild-type mice, indicating impaired ovarian function (Franca2019Exome; França2019Genetics). The mutation's pathogenicity is supported by protein structure predictions and conservation scores, suggesting that POLR3H is crucial for typical follicle development and ovarian function (Franca2019Exome).

While POLR3H has not been associated with other disorders in mammals, mutations in related RNA polymerase III subunits, such as POLR3A and POLR3B, have been linked to conditions like 4H syndrome and isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (Franca2019Exome).

## Interactions
POLR3H is a subunit of the RNA polymerase III complex, which is involved in the transcription of small non-coding RNAs. While specific interactions of POLR3H with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed extensively in the available literature, it is known to be part of the POLR3 complex, which includes other subunits such as POLR3A and POLR3F. The POLR3 complex is a major target of autoantibodies in scleroderma, indicating that POLR3H may participate in intermolecular interactions within this complex (Xu2016Systematic).

In the context of scleroderma, POLR3H has been identified as a target for autoantibodies, particularly in cancer-associated cases. This suggests that POLR3H may be involved in immune responses, potentially through interactions with other components of the POLR3 complex (Xu2016Systematic). The presence of autoantibodies against POLR3H in a significant proportion of patients with scleroderma further supports its role in the immune response (Xu2016Systematic).

Although specific interactions of POLR3H with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, its involvement in the POLR3 complex and its role in autoimmune responses suggest that it may engage in significant protein-protein interactions within the complex.
