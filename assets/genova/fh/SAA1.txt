# SAA1

## Overview
The SAA1 gene encodes the serum amyloid A1 (SAA1) protein, a member of the serum amyloid A family of proteins, which are classified as acute-phase reactants. SAA1 is primarily synthesized in the liver and plays a pivotal role in the body's response to inflammation. The protein is characterized by its ability to associate with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in the bloodstream, where it influences lipid metabolism and immune responses. Structurally, SAA1 is composed of a polypeptide chain that forms a Y-shaped helix bundle, facilitating its interaction with lipids and various cell surface receptors. These interactions enable SAA1 to participate in cholesterol transport, immune cell recruitment, and modulation of inflammatory pathways. The gene's expression and the protein's function are implicated in several pathological conditions, including amyloidosis, cardiovascular diseases, and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Sun2016Serum; Abouelasrar2020Serum; Gursky2020Structural).

## Structure
The SAA1 protein is encoded by the SAA1 gene and consists of a polypeptide chain of approximately 104 amino acids following the cleavage of an 18-amino acid signal peptide (Sun2016Serum). The primary structure of SAA1 includes several isoforms, such as SAA1α, SAA1β, and SAA1γ, which differ by a few amino acids (Buck2016Structure).

The secondary structure of SAA1 is characterized by four antiparallel α-helices, spanning residues 1-27, 32-47, 50-69, and 73-88, with a C-terminal loop forming strong salt bridges and hydrogen bonds with the α-helices (Buck2016Structure). The tertiary structure of SAA1 features a Y-shaped helix bundle stabilized by a flexible C-terminal tail, with amphipathic helices h1 and h3 forming a large hydrophobic face crucial for lipid binding (Gursky2020Structural).

In terms of quaternary structure, SAA1 can form hexamers composed of identical subunits, with the N-terminal region containing an HDL binding site (Sun2016Serum; Buck2016Structure). The protein's ability to bind lipids is facilitated by a concave hydrophobic surface formed by helices h1 and h3 (Frame2020Structural). SAA1 is also known to undergo post-translational modifications, including association with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) during the acute phase response (Buck2016Structure).

## Function
Serum amyloid A1 (SAA1) is an acute-phase protein primarily produced by hepatocytes in response to proinflammatory cytokines such as IL1, IL6, and TNF-α. It plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism and immune response during inflammation. SAA1 is secreted into the plasma, where it associates with high-density lipoprotein (HDL), altering its function from cholesterol removal to recycling. This association is facilitated by SAA1's unique protein structure, which includes amphipathic α-helices that bind to HDL, preventing amyloidogenic misfolding (Gursky2020Structural).

SAA1 acts as a lipid acceptor for the ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCA1, aiding in cholesterol efflux and transport to the liver for excretion. It enhances cholesterol efflux in a scavenger receptor SR-BI-dependent manner, which is significant for cholesterol homeostasis and immune cell recruitment at inflammation sites (Sun2016Serum). SAA1 also exhibits chemotactic properties, recruiting leukocytes and promoting monocyte survival, which is essential for immune responses (Abouelasrar2020Serum).

In addition to its role in lipid transport, SAA1 is involved in immune modulation by binding to various receptors, including TLR2 and TLR4, and activating immune response pathways. This activity contributes to both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects, depending on the context and structural state of the protein (Gursky2020Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SAA1 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. SAA1 is implicated in the pathogenesis of secondary or AA amyloidosis, where genetic variations such as homozygosity for SAA1α or SAA1γ increase the risk of developing the disease. This condition involves the misfolding of AA protein derived from SAA1 into insoluble fibrils that impair organ function (Sun2016Serum; Buck2016Structure). 

In cancer, SAA1 expression is linked to poor prognosis in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and is associated with advanced TNM stages and poor outcomes. It may regulate the tumor microenvironment through immune cell recruitment and cytokine induction, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Xu2023SAA1). Elevated SAA1 levels are also observed in various tumors, where it may influence tumor immunity and metastasis (Sack2018Serum).

SAA1 polymorphisms are associated with cardiovascular diseases and certain cancers, such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma, due to their effects on angiogenesis and tumor suppression (Sun2016Serum). Additionally, SAA1 is linked to chronic inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis (den2023Serum).

## Interactions
Serum amyloid A1 (SAA1) is involved in various interactions with proteins and other molecules, playing a significant role in inflammation and immune response. SAA1 primarily interacts with high-density lipoprotein (HDL), where it displaces apoA-1 during the acute-phase response, although it cannot replace apoA-1 in HDL particle formation (Sun2016Serum). It also binds to the scavenger receptor SR-BI, inhibiting HDL binding but enhancing cholesterol efflux, which is crucial for cholesterol recycling during tissue repair (Sun2016Serum).

SAA1 interacts with several cell surface receptors, including formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2), Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 (TLR2 and TLR4), and the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). These interactions mediate various immune responses, such as cytokine induction and chemotactic activity for phagocytes (Sun2016Serum; Abouelasrar2020Serum). SAA1 also binds to the outer membrane protein A (OmpA) of Gram-negative bacteria, acting as an opsonin to enhance bacterial uptake by neutrophils (Sun2016Serum).

SAA1's interaction with heparan sulfate facilitates its dissociation from HDL and conversion to amyloid fibrils, contributing to amyloidogenesis (Sun2016Serum). These interactions highlight SAA1's multifaceted role in immune regulation and inflammation.
