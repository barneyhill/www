# ZNF484

## Overview
ZNF484 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 484, a member of the Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) zinc-finger protein family. This protein functions primarily as a transcription factor, playing a crucial role in regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. Zinc finger protein 484 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and development, and is particularly noted for its role in modulating inflammation-related genes. Its expression is significantly increased in certain pathological conditions, such as coronary artery disease (CAD) and atherosclerosis, where it influences macrophage polarization and inflammatory responses (Holvoet2019RNAsequencing). Additionally, ZNF484 has been implicated in cancer biology, where it is associated with cell proliferation and apoptosis, highlighting its potential impact on both cardiovascular and oncological diseases (Dong2021Identification; Wu2019Integration).

## Function
ZNF484 is a Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) zinc-finger protein that functions primarily as a transcription factor, regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. In healthy human cells, ZNF484 is involved in modulating the transcription of target genes, which plays a role in various cellular processes such as cell differentiation and development. The protein's activity is associated with the regulation of inflammation-related genes, particularly in the context of coronary artery disease (CAD) and atherosclerosis (Holvoet2019RNAsequencing).

ZNF484 expression is notably increased in monocytes of patients with unstable CAD and in human atherosclerotic lesions. This overexpression is linked to the polarization of macrophages towards the M1 phenotype, which is associated with inflammatory responses in atherosclerotic plaques (Holvoet2019RNAsequencing). The protein's expression patterns in monocytes reflect inflammatory activation rather than lipid metabolism, suggesting its involvement in inflammatory processes within atherosclerosis (Holvoet2019RNAsequencing).

While the specific molecular function of ZNF484 in cell biology is not fully detailed, its role as a transcription factor and its association with inflammatory markers indicate its potential impact on vascular injury and inflammation in cardiovascular diseases (Holvoet2019RNAsequencing).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF484 has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression and interactions. In melanoma, ZNF484 is identified as a candidate gene, functioning as a linker gene within a subnetwork of cancer-related pathways. It is associated with the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptotic processes, suggesting a role in cancer-related biological processes (Wu2019Integration). 

In coronary artery disease (CAD), ZNF484 expression is elevated in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients compared to those with stable CAD. It is part of a minimal gene model that can differentiate ACS from stable CAD with high accuracy. ZNF484 is associated with inflammatory processes in atherosclerotic plaques, correlating with markers of inflammatory macrophages, which indicates its involvement in vascular inflammation (Holvoet2019RNAsequencing).

ZNF484 is also involved in hepatic tumorigenesis and has been identified as a cancer-associated gene in the context of lung cancer and other malignancies. Its role in cancer development is further supported by its involvement in methylation changes and differential splicing in cancerous tissues (Wu2019Integration; Dong2021Identification).
