# NSRP1

## Overview
NSRP1, or nuclear speckle splicing regulatory protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing, a critical process in gene expression. The NSRP1 protein is characterized by the presence of two RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains and an arginine-serine (RS)-like domain, which are essential for its splicing activity and interaction with other splicing factors. This protein is predominantly localized in nuclear speckles, subnuclear structures rich in splicing factors, where it plays a significant role in modulating alternative splicing events. NSRP1's function is particularly crucial in the brain, where it influences processes such as neurogenesis and neuronal excitability. Pathogenic variants in the NSRP1 gene can lead to severe neurodevelopmental disorders, underscoring its importance in early development and brain function (Calame2021Biallelic).

## Structure
The NSRP1 gene encodes a protein consisting of 558 amino acids, featuring two RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains and an arginine-serine (RS)-like domain. These domains are crucial for the protein's splicing activity and self-oligomerization (Calame2021Biallelic). The NSRP1 protein also includes two coiled-coil domains that overlap with the RRM and RS-like domains, and a C-terminal nuclear localization signal located within the RS-like domain, which is essential for its nuclear localization and splicing activity (Calame2021Biallelic). 

NSRP1 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different transcripts. One major alternate transcript, ENST00000612959.4, lacks the second exon of NM_032141.4, leading to a truncated protein of 504 amino acids due to N-terminal truncation (Calame2021Biallelic). Another transcript introduces a premature termination codon and is likely subject to nonsense-mediated decay (Calame2021Biallelic). 

The protein is involved in splicing regulation and interacts with splicing factors such as SRSF1 and SRSF2, influencing exon inclusion or exclusion in a gene-specific manner (Calame2021Biallelic). Pathogenic variants in NSRP1 can disrupt the nuclear localization signal, leading to abnormal cytoplasmic localization and loss of splicing activity (Calame2021Biallelic).

## Function
NSRP1 (nuclear speckle splicing regulatory protein 1) is a crucial component in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing, a fundamental process in gene expression. It is localized in nuclear speckles, which are subnuclear structures rich in splicing factors, and plays a significant role in modulating alternative splicing events. NSRP1 contains two RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains and an arginine-serine (RS)-like domain, which are essential for its splicing activity. These domains facilitate interactions with other splicing factors, such as SRSF1 and SRSF2, allowing NSRP1 to antagonize their activities and influence exon inclusion or exclusion in a gene-specific manner (Calame2021Biallelic).

In healthy human cells, NSRP1 is critical for proper RNA splicing, impacting cellular processes such as neurogenesis, cortical lamination, synaptogenesis, and neuronal excitability. Its activity is particularly important in the brain, where it contributes to maintaining homeostasis and normal development. The absence or dysfunction of NSRP1 can lead to severe neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its essential role in early development and brain function (Calame2021Biallelic). NSRP1's involvement in splicing regulation suggests it may influence a network of genes involved in neuritogenesis and other cellular processes (Calame2021Biallelic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NSRP1 gene have been linked to a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by spastic cerebral palsy and epilepsy. This disorder is caused by biallelic loss-of-function variants in NSRP1, which lead to significant clinical features such as developmental delay, epilepsy, hypotonia, appendicular spasticity, microcephaly, dysphagia, and dysmorphic facies. Affected individuals often experience drug-resistant seizures beginning in infancy, and many are nonverbal and nonambulatory. Brain abnormalities, including underopercularization, simplified gyral pattern, cerebellar vermian hypoplasia, corpus callosum dysgenesis, and a thin brainstem, are common in these patients (Calame2021Biallelic).

The disorder associated with NSRP1 mutations is autosomal recessive and fits the clinical criteria for developmental and epileptic encephalopathies. The identified variants are ultrarare, with some being private variants not found in large databases. These mutations disrupt the nuclear localization signal necessary for NSRP1's splicing function, leading to the observed clinical phenotypes (Calame2021Biallelic). The study by Calame et al. emphasizes the critical role of NSRP1 in neurodevelopment and its association with severe neurological disorders when mutated, highlighting its potential classification as a cerebral palsy gene (Calame2021Biallelic).

## Interactions
NSRP1 (nuclear speckle splicing regulatory protein 1) is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in RNA splicing regulation. It contains two RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains and an arginine-serine (RS)-like domain, which are essential for its splicing activity and nuclear localization (Calame2021Biallelic). NSRP1 interacts with serine/arginine-rich splicing factors 1 and 2 (SRSF1, SRSF2), promoting exon inclusion or exclusion, thereby modulating splice site selection in a gene-specific manner (Calame2021Biallelic).

NSRP1 also interacts with the tandem WW domains of the YAP protein, containing an arginine-based binding motif that suggests a strong binding affinity, potentially higher than other known WW domain binding peptides (Bacon2021Quantitative). In cancer cells, NSRP1 is one of the splicing factors whose splicing is modulated by DAP3, a splicing regulatory RNA-binding protein. DAP3 depletion leads to the skipping of NSRP1 exon 2, indicating a regulatory interaction (Han2022Multilayered).

These interactions highlight NSRP1's role in forming part of larger multiprotein complexes that regulate gene expression through alternative splicing, impacting various cellular processes and potentially contributing to disease states when dysregulated.
