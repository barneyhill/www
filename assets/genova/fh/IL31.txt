# IL31

## Overview
Interleukin 31 (IL31) is a gene that encodes the cytokine protein interleukin 31, which is a member of the four-helix bundle cytokine family. This cytokine is primarily involved in immune regulation and inflammatory responses, playing a significant role in various signaling pathways, including JAK/STAT, PI3K/AKT, and MAPK. IL31 interacts with a heterodimeric receptor complex composed of IL31 receptor alpha (IL31RA) and oncostatin M receptor beta (OSMRβ), which is essential for its biological activity (Di2018IL33IL31; Zhang2008Structures). The IL31 protein is particularly noted for its involvement in skin-related conditions, such as atopic dermatitis, where it contributes to pruritus and inflammation (Dubin2021The; Sonkoly2006IL-31:). Additionally, IL31 is implicated in other diseases, including psoriasis and asthma, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in inflammatory and pruritic disorders (Murdaca2019IL33IL31; PurzyckaBohdan2021Significance).

## Structure
The IL31 protein is a cytokine characterized by a four-helix bundle structure, typical of cytokines, with one disulfide bond linking the AB loop with the D helix. The mature human IL31 protein consists of 141 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 15.5 kDa, which increases to an apparent 24 kDa upon glycosylation (Hermanns2015Oncostatin). The B and C helices in IL31 are unusually short, consisting of 10-16 amino acids, placing IL31 between the families of long-chain and short-chain four-helix bundle cytokines (Hermanns2015Oncostatin). 

IL31 does not utilize the common gp130 receptor subunit like other IL-6-type cytokines. Instead, it binds with low affinity to the IL31 receptor alpha (IL31RA), which contains five extracellular fibronectin type III domains. The interaction involves specific amino acids, including Glu44 in helix A, Glu106/His110 in helix C, and Lys134 in the N-terminus of helix D (Hermanns2015Oncostatin). The IL31 gene is located on chromosome 12q24.31, and the IL31 cDNA encodes a 164 amino acid precursor, which is processed into the mature 141 amino acid polypeptide (Zhang2008Structures).

## Function
Interleukin 31 (IL31) is a cytokine involved in various signaling pathways in human cells, primarily through its receptor complex composed of IL-31RA and OSMR. This complex activates several key pathways, including MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and JAK/STAT, which are crucial for regulating immune responses and cell proliferation (Chattopadhyay2007Interleukin31; Zhang2008Structures). IL31 is particularly effective in engaging the STAT3 pathway, leading to the induction of STAT3-sensitive genes and changes in cell morphology (Chattopadhyay2007Interleukin31). 

In lung epithelial cells, IL31 suppresses cell proliferation by modulating cell cycle regulators, such as up-regulating p27 Kip1 and down-regulating cyclin B1, CDC2, and CDK6, resulting in cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase (Chattopadhyay2007Interleukin31). IL31 also plays a role in hematopoiesis, as its receptor deficiency affects hematopoietic progenitor cell homeostasis in bone marrow and spleen (Zhang2008Structures). 

IL31 is implicated in immune regulation and is involved in maintaining homeostasis in various tissues, including the skin and lungs, where it modulates inflammatory responses and cell proliferation (Chattopadhyay2007Interleukin31; Zhang2008Structures).

## Clinical Significance
Interleukin 31 (IL31) is implicated in various inflammatory and pruritic conditions due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. Elevated IL31 expression is significantly associated with atopic dermatitis (AD), where it contributes to pruritus and skin inflammation. In AD, IL31 levels are upregulated in lesional and nonlesional skin, correlating with disease severity and itch intensity (Dubin2021The; Sonkoly2006IL-31:). IL31 is also linked to other skin disorders such as pemphigus herpetiformis, chronic spontaneous urticaria, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, suggesting potential benefits of targeting IL31 in these conditions (Datsi2021Interleukin‐31:).

In psoriasis, IL31 serum levels are elevated, although they do not correlate with disease severity or pruritus intensity. Specific IL31 gene polymorphisms, such as -1066G/A, are more frequent in psoriasis patients, indicating a potential role in disease pathogenesis (PurzyckaBohdan2021Significance). IL31 is also involved in asthma, where it contributes to airway inflammation and correlates with disease severity (Murdaca2019IL33IL31). In hematological malignancies like cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, IL31 is associated with pruritus, although its role in disease progression is less clear (Di2021IL31).

## Interactions
Interleukin 31 (IL31) interacts with a heterodimeric receptor complex composed of IL31 receptor alpha (IL31RA) and oncostatin M receptor beta (OSMRβ). This interaction is crucial for the activation of several signaling pathways, including JAK/STAT, PI3K/AKT, and MAPK pathways (Di2018IL33IL31; Zhang2008Structures). IL31 binds to the IL31RA/OSMR complex, leading to the phosphorylation of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 via Janus kinase (JAK) 1 and JAK2 (Nemmer2021Interleukin31). The IL31RA alone is insufficient for effective signaling and requires the recruitment of OSMR to activate pathways such as ERK1/2 MAP kinases (Zhang2008Structures).

The IL31RA/OSMR complex also facilitates the recruitment of adaptor proteins like Shc, which are essential for downstream signaling (Di2018IL33IL31). Negative feedback mechanisms involving suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins, such as SOCS1 and SOCS3, can inhibit STAT3 activation, thereby modulating the signaling cascade (Nemmer2021Interleukin31). These interactions highlight the complex network of protein interactions that IL31 participates in, influencing various biological functions and disease processes.
