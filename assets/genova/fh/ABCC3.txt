# ABCC3

## Overview
The ABCC3 gene encodes the ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 3 (MRP3), a transmembrane protein that belongs to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. This protein functions as an ATP-dependent efflux pump, primarily facilitating the transport of organic anions across cellular membranes. MRP3 is particularly involved in the transport of glucuronidated compounds, such as bilirubin glucuronides and estradiol-17β-glucuronide, and is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, kidney, intestine, and skin (Gradhand2007Functional; Choudhuri2006Structure). The protein's structure comprises two transmembrane domains and two nucleotide-binding domains, which are essential for its transport function (Chloupková2007Expression; Choudhuri2006Structure). MRP3 plays a crucial role in protecting cells from the accumulation of potentially toxic compounds, particularly under conditions where normal excretory pathways are impaired, such as cholestasis (Choudhuri2006Structure). The gene's expression and function are subject to regulation by various factors, including epigenetic modifications and bile acid levels (Choudhuri2006Structure; Takechi2018Interindividual).

## Structure
The ABCC3 gene encodes a protein that is part of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, specifically known as Multidrug Resistance-associated Protein 3 (MRP3). The protein is composed of two transmembrane domains (TMDs) and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), which are crucial for its function in transporting various molecules across cellular membranes (Chloupková2007Expression; Choudhuri2006Structure). The transmembrane domains are organized into three hydrophobic regions, designated TMD0 through TMD2, with a total of 17 transmembrane segments. TMD0 contains 5 segments, while TMD1 and TMD2 each have 6 segments (Choudhuri2006Structure).

The primary structure of ABCC3 includes a sequence that allows for the formation of these domains, while the secondary structure is characterized by alpha helices and beta sheets. The tertiary structure is stabilized by interactions between these elements, facilitating the protein's function as a transporter. Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are predicted in ABCC3, although their necessity for proper localization is not confirmed (Nies2013MRP2; Kobayashi2008Functional).

ABCC3 also has splice variant isoforms, with transcript variant 2 lacking multiple 3' exons, resulting in a shorter isoform with a different C-terminus (Nies2013MRP2). These structural features contribute to the protein's role in the transport of a broad range of endogenous and xenobiotic conjugated organic anions.

## Function
The ABCC3 gene encodes the multidrug resistance protein 3 (MRP3), which is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. MRP3 functions as an ATP-dependent efflux pump, primarily involved in the transport of organic anions across cell membranes. It has a preference for glucuronidated compounds, with typical substrates including estradiol-17β-glucuronide and bilirubin glucuronides (Gradhand2007Functional). MRP3 is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, kidney, intestine, and skin, and is located in the basolateral membrane of polarized cells such as hepatocytes and gallbladder epithelial cells (Gradhand2007Functional; Choudhuri2006Structure).

In the liver, MRP3 plays a protective role by extruding bile acids and glucuronide conjugates into sinusoidal blood, preventing their accumulation in hepatocytes when normal excretory functions are compromised, such as during cholestasis (Choudhuri2006Structure). The expression of MRP3 is upregulated in response to bile acids, which regulate its transcription through a bile acid-responsive region in its promoter (Choudhuri2006Structure). In human skin, ABCC3 expression shows significant interindividual variability, influenced by epigenetic factors such as DNA methylation, which regulates its transcriptional activity (Takechi2018Interindividual).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ABCC3 gene have been linked to various clinical conditions, particularly in the context of drug resistance and pharmacokinetics. The -211 C > T polymorphism in the promoter region of ABCC3 is associated with decreased mRNA levels and altered pharmacokinetics of morphine in pediatric patients, leading to lower plasma concentrations of morphine metabolites (Bruckmueller2021ABCB1). This variant is also linked to methotrexate pharmacokinetics in juvenile idiopathic arthritis and pediatric osteosarcoma patients (van2014New; Bruckmueller2021ABCB1).

In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), increased expression of ABCC3 is associated with resistance to imatinib treatment, as it affects the drug's cellular efflux (Giannoudis2014The). In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the 45 + 1226 T > G variant is linked to shorter disease-free survival (Bruckmueller2021ABCB1). ABCC3 expression is also elevated in certain cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma and ovarian cancer, where it contributes to drug resistance (van2014New).

The MRP3-Arg 1297 His variant, although not directly associated with specific diseases, has been studied for its potential role in drug resistance, particularly in cancer (Conseil2005Polymorphisms; Lee2004Identification).
