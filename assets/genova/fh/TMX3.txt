# TMX3

## Overview
TMX3, or thioredoxin related transmembrane protein 3, is a gene that encodes a member of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family, which is involved in catalyzing the formation of disulfide bonds within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The TMX3 protein is characterized by a thioredoxin-like domain and functions as a single-pass transmembrane protein, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis and proper protein folding (Chao2010A). It is implicated in various cellular processes, including stress responses and protein quality control, and has been associated with diseases such as breast cancer and developmental eye disorders. TMX3's involvement in the Notch signaling pathway suggests its potential role as a tumor suppressor, making it a candidate for therapeutic targeting in cancer treatment (Qiu2023Sitespecific). Additionally, mutations in TMX3 have been linked to eye development anomalies, highlighting its importance in morphogenesis (Chao2010A).

## Structure
The TMX3 protein is a member of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family and is characterized by a thioredoxin-like domain that catalyzes the formation of disulfide bonds. It contains a short sequence motif, CXXC, which represents the active site for the oxido-reductase reaction, and forms a thioredoxin-like fold (Chao2010A). Human TMX3 is a single-pass membrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and consists of 454 amino acids, with a molecular weight of 51.8 kDa. The protein is N-glycosylated and has two isoforms (Chao2010A).

The luminal region of TMX3 includes an N-terminal ER signal peptide (residues 1-24), a catalytic thioredoxin-like domain containing the active CGHC sequence (residues 25-131), and two redox-inactive thioredoxin-like domains. It also features a transmembrane domain and a C-terminal domain with a KKXX motif (Chao2010A). The overall sequence similarity is 93% with murine TMX3 and 28% with the D. melanogaster and C. elegans orthologous proteins (Chao2010A). The specific details of the tertiary and quaternary structures are not provided in the available context.

## Function
TMX3, or thioredoxin related transmembrane protein 3, is a member of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family and plays a crucial role in redox reactions within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It is involved in the formation of disulfide bonds, which are essential for proper protein folding and maintenance of cellular redox homeostasis (Chao2010A). TMX3 is a single-pass membrane protein of the ER and contains a thioredoxin domain that catalyzes these reactions. The protein is N-glycosylated and includes an N-terminal ER signal peptide, a catalytic thioredoxin-like domain with an active CGHC sequence, two redox-inactive thioredoxin-like domains, a transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal domain with a KKXX motif (Chao2010A).

In healthy human cells, TMX3 is primarily active in the ER membrane, where it influences cellular stress responses and protein quality control. Its activity is crucial for proper protein maturation and function, impacting overall organismal health. TMX3's role in oxidative protein folding is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and ensuring the correct assembly and function of proteins (Chao2010A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the TMX3 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly breast cancer and developmental eye disorders. In breast cancer, TMX3 expression is significantly decreased in certain cell lines, such as MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-453. This downregulation is associated with increased tumorigenesis through the Notch signaling pathway. Overexpression of TMX3 in these cells inhibits proliferation, promotes apoptosis, and reduces migration, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role. TMX3 overexpression also affects epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target in breast cancer (Qiu2023Sitespecific).

In eye development, TMX3 mutations are linked to conditions such as microphthalmia and anophthalmia. Specific mutations, like c.116G.A (p.Arg39Gln) and c.322G.A (p.Asp108Asn), have been identified in patients with these conditions. Studies using zebrafish models have shown that reduced expression of TMX3 leads to smaller eye sizes and coloboma, a defect in eye structure. These findings suggest that TMX3 plays a critical role in eye morphogenesis, and its deficiency can lead to developmental eye disorders (Chao2010A).

## Interactions
TMX3, a member of the thioredoxin-related transmembrane protein family, is involved in interactions that influence breast cancer progression through the Notch signaling pathway. Overexpression of TMX3 in breast cancer cell lines such as MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-453 has been shown to decrease the expression of key proteins in the Jagged/Notch signaling pathway, including Jagged1 (Jag1), Notch1, and Notch3. This interaction suggests that TMX3 may inhibit breast cancer cell proliferation and metastasis by modulating this pathway (Qiu2023Sitespecific).

TMX3's role in the Notch signaling pathway is further highlighted by the use of the Notch1 agonist NSC 22423, which can reverse the effects of TMX3 overexpression, indicating a direct interaction between TMX3 and components of the Notch pathway (Qiu2023Sitespecific). These interactions suggest that TMX3 may act as a tumor suppressor by affecting the Jagged/Notch axis, potentially serving as a diagnostic and therapeutic target in breast cancer (Qiu2023Sitespecific). However, specific protein-protein interactions involving TMX3 beyond the Notch pathway are not detailed in the available context.
