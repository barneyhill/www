# UBXN2A

## Overview
UBXN2A is a gene that encodes the UBX domain protein 2A, a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, including protein degradation and stress response mechanisms. The protein is characterized by the presence of a UBX domain, which facilitates its interaction with other proteins, such as p97, and plays a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. UBX domain protein 2A is also involved in modulating the stability of proteins at the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation level and has been implicated in cancer cell apoptosis through its interaction with mortalin and p53. This interaction is particularly significant in the context of colon cancer, where UBXN2A enhances the tumor-suppressing activity of p53 and increases chemosensitivity, making it a potential target for therapeutic strategies (Sane2016Structural; Abdullah2015A).

## Structure
UBXN2A is a protein characterized by the presence of a UBX domain, which is crucial for its role in protein-protein interactions. The SEP domain of UBXN2A is particularly significant as it mediates binding to the substrate-binding domain (SBD) of mortalin, an interaction that is essential for its pro-apoptotic function in cancer cells (Sane2016Structural). Molecular modeling studies have utilized the solution structure of human p47 as a template to model the SEP domain, indicating a structural similarity that facilitates its interaction with mortalin (Sane2016Structural).

The interaction between UBXN2A and mortalin involves specific amino acids within mortalin's SBD, namely PRO442, LYS555, and ILE558, which are critical for binding (Sane2016Structural). This binding potentially induces conformational changes in mortalin, affecting its interaction with other proteins and suggesting a regulatory role for UBXN2A in modulating mortalin's function (Sane2016Structural).

UBXN2A's role in stabilizing p53 by interfering with the mortalin-CHIP E3 ubiquitin ligase complex further highlights its functional significance in cellular processes, particularly in the context of cancer therapy (Sane2016Structural). However, specific details about the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of UBXN2A are not provided in the available context.

## Function
UBXN2A, also known as UBX domain protein 2A, plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis through its involvement in protein degradation and stress response mechanisms. It interacts with the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a key pathway for the removal of misfolded or damaged proteins, thereby preventing the accumulation of potentially toxic protein aggregates within the cell. This interaction is vital for the regulation of protein quality control and cellular stress responses, ensuring the proper functioning of cellular processes.

UBXN2A is active in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, indicating its versatile role in different cellular compartments. In the cytoplasm, it contributes to the degradation of proteins by facilitating their recognition and processing by the proteasome. In the nucleus, UBXN2A may influence gene expression and other nuclear processes by modulating the turnover of nuclear proteins. This dual localization underscores its importance in various cellular functions and its potential impact on cell survival, particularly under stress conditions.

The activity of UBXN2A in these processes is essential for maintaining cellular equilibrium and may have implications for cancer cell survival, suggesting a potential role in oncogenesis or tumor suppression.

## Clinical Significance
UBXN2A has been identified as a significant player in the progression and treatment of colon cancer. Alterations in its expression levels are associated with cancer cell apoptosis and tumor suppression. Overexpression of UBXN2A in colon cancer cells leads to increased apoptosis through the activation of executioner caspases 3/7 and enhances the tumor-suppressing activity of p53 by disrupting its interaction with the oncoprotein mortalin (mot-2) (Sane2014Ubiquitinlike; Abdullah2015Nucleocytoplasmic). This disruption is crucial as mot-2 sequesters p53 in the cytoplasm, preventing its tumor-suppressing functions (Abdullah2015Nucleocytoplasmic).

UBXN2A's role in cancer therapy is further highlighted by its ability to enhance chemosensitivity. It has been shown to increase the effectiveness of chemotherapeutic agents like 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) and etoposide by promoting apoptosis in cancer cells (Sane2016Structural; Abdullah2015A). The plant alkaloid veratridine has been identified as a potent inducer of UBXN2A, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies to increase UBXN2A expression in cancer treatment (Abdullah2015A). Despite its therapeutic potential, UBXN2A is underexpressed in 50% of colon cancer patients, indicating a need for strategies to enhance its expression in these individuals (Abdullah2015A).

## Interactions
UBXN2A is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It acts as a cofactor for p97, a protein involved in the ubiquitination process, and is shown to interact with CHIP, an E3 ligase, and the α3 subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). UBXN2A, CHIP, and α3 can form a complex with p97, suggesting a regulatory role in the stability of α3 at the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) level (Teng2015UBXN2A). UBXN2A interacts with p97 through its UBX domain, which is necessary for this interaction, while its SEP domain is required for interaction with the α3 subunit of nAChRs (Teng2015UBXN2A).

UBXN2A also plays a role in cancer cell apoptosis by interfering with p53-mortalin interactions. It binds to the substrate-binding domain of mortalin, a protein that shares a binding site with p53, suggesting competitive binding. This interaction leads to apoptosis in colon cancer cells by releasing p53 from mortalin, allowing p53 to translocate to the nucleus and activate apoptotic pathways (Sane2014Ubiquitinlike). UBXN2A's interaction with mortalin is crucial for enhancing the tumor's sensitivity to chemotherapy (Sane2016Structural).
