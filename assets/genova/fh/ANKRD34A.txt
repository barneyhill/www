# ANKRD34A

## Overview
ANKRD34A is a gene that encodes the ankyrin repeat domain 34A protein, which is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat domains. These domains are known for their role in mediating protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the protein plays a crucial role in cellular signaling and structural organization. The ankyrin repeat domain 34A protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, where it is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and intracellular transport. Although the precise molecular functions of the protein remain to be fully elucidated, its involvement in maintaining cellular architecture and coordinating signaling pathways is considered essential for normal cellular function. The gene's expression and regulation have been linked to several pathological conditions, including cancer and potentially Parkinson's disease, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Xu2021Regulation; Zhang2020Distinguishing; Moran2008Towards).

## Structure


## Function
ANKRD34A encodes a protein characterized by ankyrin repeat domains, which are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions. This suggests that ANKRD34A plays a significant role in cellular signaling and structural organization within cells. The protein is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, where it may influence various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and intracellular transport. By mediating interactions between different proteins, ANKRD34A potentially contributes to the maintenance of cellular architecture and the coordination of signaling pathways that are crucial for normal cell function. The specific molecular activities of ANKRD34A, while not fully elucidated, are likely integral to the proper functioning of cellular mechanisms that ensure healthy cell proliferation and organization.

## Clinical Significance
The ANKRD34A gene has been implicated in various cancers due to changes in its methylation status. Methylation changes in ANKRD34A have been observed during the initiation and progression of multiple tumor subtypes, including lung, colon, bladder, lymphoma, breast, and ovarian cancers. These changes suggest a potential role in tumorigenesis (Zhang2020Distinguishing). Additionally, the methylation status of ANKRD34A may be connected with glioma, particularly low-grade glioma, where it is thought to participate in the RNA regulatory network (Zhang2020Distinguishing).

In the context of Parkinson's disease (PD), ANKRD34 is categorized as a peripheral gene with few known interactions and unknown pathway connections. Its role in PD or other conditions remains to be determined, as it is not well integrated into known brain metabolic pathways (Moran2008Towards).

In a study on hypoxic pulmonary hypertension (HPH), ANKRD34A was mentioned in the context of circular RNAs acting as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) in a rat model. However, the specific role of ANKRD34A in HPH requires further investigation (Xu2021Regulation).
