# PIRT

## Overview
The PIRT gene encodes the phosphoinositide interacting regulator of transient receptor potential channels, a small membrane protein that plays a crucial role in the modulation of ion channels, particularly transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. This protein is characterized by its two transmembrane helices and an amphipathic C-terminal α-helix, which facilitate its interactions with various molecules, including phosphoinositides and calmodulin (Sisco2019Competitive; Kim2008Pirt). PIRT acts as a regulatory subunit for TRP channels such as TRPV1 and TRPM8, influencing sensory perceptions like pain and temperature sensation (Kim2008Pirt; Tang2013Pirt). Additionally, PIRT's interactions with cholesterol-like ligands and its involvement in stress-induced inflammatory processes suggest broader physiological roles, including potential sex-specific regulatory functions (Sisco2020PIRT). The gene's expression and function are significant in various physiological and pathological contexts, including sensory dysfunctions and metabolic disorders (Jall2019Pirt; Tang2015Phosphoinositide).

## Structure
The PIRT protein is a small membrane protein with a molecular structure characterized by two transmembrane helices and an amphipathic C-terminal α-helix (Sisco2019Competitive; Kim2008Pirt). The primary structure of PIRT includes a highly conserved calmodulin-binding motif within the C-terminal α-helix, specifically a 1-14 motif from Ile113 or Ile114 to Phe126 or Leu127 (Sisco2020PIRT). This motif is consistent with an α-helix structure, allowing hydrophobic residues to fit into calmodulin-binding pockets (Sisco2020PIRT).

PIRT also contains cholesterol-binding domains, including a CRAC motif in the outer leaflet of the first transmembrane α-helix and a CARC domain in the inner leaflet, which are involved in cholesterol binding (Sisco2020PIRT). The CRAC domain includes residues Val70-Tyr77-Lys80, confirmed to bind cholesterol (Sisco2020PIRT).

The protein's C-terminal region is rich in positively charged residues, characteristic of phosphoinositide-binding domains, which facilitate interactions with PIP2 and PIP3 (Kim2008Pirt). PIRT's interaction with phosphoinositides is crucial for its role as a regulatory subunit of TRP channels, such as TRPV1 and TRPM8 (Kim2008Pirt; Hilton2016Biophysical).

## Function
The PIRT protein functions as a regulatory subunit of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, particularly TRPV1 and TRPM8, which are involved in sensory perception such as pain and temperature sensation. PIRT is expressed in the peripheral nervous system, specifically in nociceptive neurons of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and trigeminal ganglia, and is not found in the central nervous system (Kim2008Pirt; Tang2013Pirt). It enhances TRPV1-mediated currents by binding to both TRPV1 and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), a phosphoinositide that is crucial for TRPV1 regulation (Kim2008Pirt). PIRT's interaction with PIP2 is dependent on a cluster of basic residues in its C terminus, which is essential for its regulatory function (Kim2008Pirt).

PIRT also modulates TRPM8, enhancing its sensitivity to menthol and cold temperatures, which is important for cold sensation (Tang2013Pirt). In addition to its role in sensory perception, PIRT regulates bladder function by inhibiting the purinergic receptor P2X3, which is involved in bladder overactivity (Gao2015Pirt). This multifaceted role of PIRT in modulating ion channels highlights its importance in sensory neuron function and organismal sensory responses.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the PIRT gene have been implicated in various physiological and pathological conditions. PIRT is known to modulate TRP channels, particularly TRPM8, which are involved in sensory perception, including cold sensation and pain. Mutations or changes in PIRT expression can affect sensory functions, potentially contributing to conditions like neuropathic pain and altered cold sensitivity. PIRT-null mice exhibit impaired pain behavior and reduced responsiveness to cool temperatures, indicating its role in sensory perception (Tang2015Phosphoinositide; Tang2013Pirt).

PIRT's interaction with cholesterol-like ligands and calmodulin suggests it may influence TRP channel-specific stress-induced inflammatory processes and uterine contraction pain, with potential implications for sex-specific regulatory roles (Sisco2020PIRT). In breast cancer cells, PIRT's interaction with β-estradiol may affect TRP channel expression and function, suggesting a possible link to cancer progression (Sisco2020PIRT).

Additionally, PIRT deficiency has been associated with female-specific effects on energy and glucose metabolism, potentially contributing to obesity and glucose intolerance in female mice (Jall2019Pirt). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of PIRT in metabolic disorders and sensory dysfunctions.

## Interactions
The PIRT protein interacts with several key molecules and proteins, playing a significant role in the regulation of ion channels. PIRT binds to transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, specifically TRPV1 and TRPM8, modulating their activity. The C-terminus of PIRT binds to both TRPV1 and TRPM8, as well as to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), a known regulator of TRP channel function (Kim2008Pirt; Hilton2018Phosphoinositideinteracting). PIRT's interaction with TRPV1 enhances TRPV1-mediated currents, with PIP2 playing a crucial role in this regulatory process (Kim2008Pirt).

PIRT also interacts with calmodulin (CaM), a calcium-binding protein, in a calcium-dependent manner. PIRT binds to the C-terminal α-helix of calmodulin, with a higher affinity for calcium-free calmodulin (apo-CaM) compared to calcium-bound calmodulin (holo-CaM) (Sisco2020PIRT). This interaction is important for the regulation of TRPM8, as it allows PIP2 to be shuttled to TRPM8, potentially reactivating the channel (Sisco2020PIRT).

PIRT also contains a cholesterol-recognition amino acid consensus (CRAC) domain, allowing it to bind cholesterol-like ligands, including cholesteryl-hemisuccinate, cortisol, and β-estradiol (Sisco2020PIRT). These interactions suggest a role in TRP channel-specific stress-induced inflammatory processes and possibly sex-specific regulatory roles (Sisco2020PIRT).
