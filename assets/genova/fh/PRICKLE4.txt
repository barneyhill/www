# PRICKLE4

## Overview
PRICKLE4 is a gene that encodes the prickle planar cell polarity protein 4, a member of the Prickle protein family involved in the planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway. This pathway is critical for the spatial organization of cells within tissues, influencing processes such as cell migration and tissue morphogenesis. The PRICKLE4 protein is characterized by its modular structure, including N-terminal PET and LIM domains, and a C-terminal PKH domain, which contribute to its role in cellular signaling and cytoskeletal organization. Unlike other Prickle proteins, Prickle4 lacks a mitochondrial localization signal and the Vangl binding motif, suggesting distinct cellular functions and interactions. It is primarily active in the cytoplasm and at cell membranes, where it helps establish cellular polarity and directional movement. PRICKLE4's expression in multiciliated cells indicates a potential role in cilia polarization, particularly within the respiratory tract (Radaszkiewicz2023The).

## Structure
PRICKLE4 is a member of the human PRICKLE gene family, which encodes proteins involved in planar cell polarity signaling. The PRICKLE4 protein is modular, containing several distinct domains that contribute to its function. It includes the N-terminal PET and LIM domains, and the C-terminal PKH domain. The PET domain is involved in signal transduction and protein-protein interactions, while the LIM domain, a cysteine-rich module, plays a role in gene transcription and cytoskeleton organization. Unlike other Prickle proteins, Prickle4 contains only two LIM domains, which may affect its classification within the Prickle family (Radaszkiewicz2023The).

The PKH domain, unique to vertebrate Prickle proteins, is believed to be involved in membrane localization due to its CAAX sequence, a motif important for protein targeting (Radaszkiewicz2023The). Prickle4 also features a central intrinsically disordered region, which is often associated with post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation (Radaszkiewicz2023The). The specific 3D structure of Prickle4 remains unsolved, largely due to these disordered regions (Radaszkiewicz2023The). Prickle4 lacks the Vangl binding motif (VBM) found in other Prickle proteins, which is crucial for planar cell polarity complex assembly and signaling (Radaszkiewicz2023The).

## Function
PRICKLE4 is a member of the Prickle protein family, which plays a crucial role in the planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway. This pathway is essential for the spatial organization of cells within the plane of a tissue, influencing processes such as cell migration and tissue morphogenesis. PRICKLE4 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and at cell membranes, where it contributes to establishing cellular polarity and directional cell movement (Radaszkiewicz2023The).

Unlike other Prickle proteins, PRICKLE4 lacks a mitochondrial localization signal, which suggests it may have distinct cellular functions compared to its paralogs. It contains two LIM domains and a unique CAAX sequence, which may influence its role in cellular signaling and cytoskeletal organization (Radaszkiewicz2023The). The protein's involvement in PCP signaling is crucial for maintaining tissue homeostasis and proper organ development, although specific molecular processes involving PRICKLE4 are not extensively detailed in the literature (Radaszkiewicz2023The).

PRICKLE4's expression is noted in multiciliated cells, similar to Prickle1, indicating its potential role in cilia polarization and function within the respiratory tract (Radaszkiewicz2023The). Despite its involvement in these processes, the precise molecular mechanisms and interactions of PRICKLE4 remain less understood compared to other Prickle family members.

## Clinical Significance
PRICKLE4 mutations have been observed in more than 6% of stomach and esophageal tumors, indicating a potential role in these cancers. However, the study suggests that mutations in PRICKLE genes, including PRICKLE4, are not the primary cause of PRICKLE-regulated tumorigenesis. Instead, the types of mutations vary, with PRICKLE3 and PRICKLE4 predominantly showing amplifications and deep deletions (Radaszkiewicz2023The).

PRICKLE4 is also noted for its upregulation in the Stem-A molecular subtype of breast cancer, suggesting a potential role in tumor progression. Despite this, specific diseases or conditions directly associated with PRICKLE4 gene mutations or expression alterations beyond its expression in certain cancer types are not detailed (Radaszkiewicz2023The).

The role of PRICKLE4 in developmental disorders or other diseases is less clear compared to other PRICKLE family members. While PRICKLE proteins are involved in various developmental processes and pathologies, the specific involvement of PRICKLE4 in such conditions is not well-documented in the available literature. The gene's divergence from other PRICKLE family members may affect its classification and functional implications (Radaszkiewicz2023The).
