# SLC2A11

## Overview
SLC2A11 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 2 member 11, commonly referred to as GLUT11. This protein is a member of the glucose transporter family, which is characterized by its role in facilitating the transport of glucose and fructose across cell membranes. GLUT11 is a transmembrane protein with 12 putative membrane-spanning helices, and it exists in three splice variant isoforms that are expressed in a tissue-specific manner, including in the heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, adipose tissue, and pancreas (DOEGE2001Characterization; Mueckler2013The). The protein's function is crucial for glucose and fructose metabolism, although its precise physiological role remains to be fully elucidated. SLC2A11 has also been implicated in the progression of lung adenocarcinoma, highlighting its potential significance in cancer biology (Zhang2022SLC2As).

## Structure
The SLC2A11 gene encodes the GLUT11 protein, a member of the glucose transporter family characterized by 12 putative membrane-spanning helices, which are essential for its function as a sugar-transport facilitator (DOEGE2001Characterization). The primary structure of GLUT11 includes motifs typical of transporter facilitators, such as PESPR\PETKGR motifs after helices 6 and 12, and sugar-transporter signatures like GRR\GRK motifs in loops 2 and 8 (DOEGE2001Characterization). Notably, GLUT11 contains three acidic residues (Glu-285, Asp-290, and Glu-321) in helices 7 and 8, and lacks the QLS motif in helix 7, which is present in other GLUT family members (DOEGE2001Characterization).

GLUT11 is expressed in three splice variant isoforms, which differ at their N-termini due to differential promoter usage. These variants are expressed in tissues such as heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, adipose tissue, and pancreas (Mueckler2013The). The protein is primarily found in the plasma membrane and high-density microsomal fractions, indicating its role in membrane transport (DOEGE2001Characterization). The specific post-translational modifications of GLUT11 are not detailed in the available context.

## Function
SLC2A11, also known as GLUT11, is a member of the solute carrier family involved in the facilitative transport of glucose and fructose across cell membranes. It is expressed in three variants, GLUT11-A, GLUT11-B, and GLUT11-C, which differ in their N-terminal sequences and are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. GLUT11-A is found in the heart, skeletal muscle, and kidney; GLUT11-B in the placenta, adipose tissue, and kidney; and GLUT11-C in adipose tissue, heart, skeletal muscle, and pancreas (Augustin2010The; Mueckler2013The).

GLUT11 exhibits glucose transport activity with a high affinity (K m of 0.16 mM) and also transports fructose, but not galactose. It has a low affinity for cytochalasin B, a known inhibitor of glucose transporters (Augustin2010The). The protein is localized in heart and skeletal muscle, specifically in slow-twitch muscle fibers, and its expression is generally stable under various physiological and pathophysiological conditions, except in cases of primary myopathy (Augustin2010The).

The exact physiological role of GLUT11 in healthy human cells remains unclear, but its low turnover activity and the presence of multiple variants suggest a specialized or regulated function in glucose and fructose metabolism in specific tissues (Mueckler2013The).

## Clinical Significance
SLC2A11, a member of the solute carrier family, has been implicated in the progression of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Studies have shown that SLC2A11 is overexpressed in advanced stages of LUAD, suggesting its involvement in cancer progression and its potential as a diagnostic marker and therapeutic target (Zhang2022SLC2As). The gene's expression is linked to tumor progression, and it has been identified as a prognostic marker, with higher expression levels associated with lower tumor differentiation grades and poorer prognosis (Zhang2022SLC2As).

SLC2A11 is also part of a prognostic model for predicting overall survival rates in LUAD patients. Lower mRNA expression of SLC2A11 is associated with a favorable overall survival, indicating its potential as an independent predictor of survival (Zhang2022SLC2As). The gene's expression is linked to immune cell infiltration and alterations in the tumor microenvironment, which are crucial for understanding responses to immunotherapy (Zhang2022SLC2As).

Despite its role in cancer, specific diseases directly linked to mutations in SLC2A11 have not been definitively identified, and its primary physiological substrates remain unclear (Holman2020Structure; Mueckler2013The).
