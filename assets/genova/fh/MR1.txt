# MR1

## Overview
The MR1 gene encodes the major histocompatibility complex, class I-related (MR1) protein, which is a monomorphic antigen-presenting molecule. This protein is integral to the immune system, particularly in the presentation of microbial vitamin B metabolites to mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells. Unlike classical MHC class I molecules, MR1 is specialized in binding small molecule metabolites, especially those derived from vitamin B, and is characterized by a unique antigen-binding cleft. The MR1 protein is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum in an immature state and undergoes conformational changes upon ligand binding, facilitating its transport to the cell surface where it activates MAIT cells. This activation plays a crucial role in both innate and adaptive immune responses. The MR1-MAIT cell axis is highly conserved across species, underscoring its evolutionary importance in immune surveillance (McWilliam2016The; McWilliam2017How; Reantragoon2013Antigenloaded).

## Structure
The MR1 protein is a monomorphic antigen-presenting molecule related to MHC class I, involved in presenting microbial vitamin B metabolites to mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells. Its primary structure consists of a polypeptide chain encoded by the MR1 gene. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, forming a unique antigen-binding cleft suited to bind small molecule metabolites, particularly those derived from vitamin B (Reantragoon2013Antigenloaded).

The tertiary structure of MR1 features a peptide-binding groove similar to other MHC class I molecules, with a small ligand-binding cavity known as the A' cavity. This cavity is lined with aromatic and basic residues, including tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine, arginine, and lysine, giving it an overall basic charge (LópezSagaseta2013The). The MR1 protein's structure is similar to that of HLA-A2 and includes a flexible α2 helix that can adapt structurally in a context-dependent manner (LópezSagaseta2013The).

In terms of quaternary structure, MR1 can associate with beta-2 microglobulin. A key feature of MR1 is the presence of Lys43, which forms a Schiff base with the folic acid metabolite 6-formyl pterin (6-FP), crucial for the efficient refolding of MR1 with its ligands (Reantragoon2013Antigenloaded). The MR1 protein is highly conserved between mice and humans, highlighting its evolutionary importance in immunity (Reantragoon2013Antigenloaded).

## Function
The MR1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the immune system by presenting vitamin B-related metabolites to mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells. These metabolites are derived from microbial synthesis of vitamin B2 (riboflavin) and are presented by MR1 to activate MAIT cells, which are involved in both innate and adaptive immune responses (McWilliam2016The; McWilliam2017How). 

In healthy human cells, MR1 is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in an immature, unfolded state when not bound to ligands. Upon binding with vitamin B-derived antigens, MR1 undergoes a conformational change, allowing it to form complexes that are transported to the cell surface. These MR1-antigen complexes present the metabolites to MAIT cells, activating them (McWilliam2017How). 

MR1 operates through a 'presentation-on-demand' mechanism, where it is mostly stored in the ER in the absence of ligands. This allows MR1 to act as a rapid sensor of extracellular vitamin B antigens, with its surface expression being proportional to local antigen availability (McWilliam2016The). The MR1-MAIT cell axis is highly conserved across species, indicating its significant function in immune surveillance and response (McWilliam2017How).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MR1 gene have significant clinical implications. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), increased MR1 expression is observed in brain tissues, particularly in the temporal cortex, and is associated with microglia/macrophages near amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques. This suggests a role for the MR1/MAIT cell axis in AD pathology, with higher MR1 levels correlating with Aβ levels and potentially exacerbating disease progression (WyattJohnson2023Control).

In the context of primary immunodeficiency, a homozygous mutation in MR1, specifically the R9H mutation, results in the absence of mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells. This mutation affects the MR1 protein's ability to present microbial ligands, leading to immune deficiencies and increased susceptibility to infections (Howson2020Absence).

MR1 is also implicated in other neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and glioma, where increased expression correlates with disease severity (WyattJohnson2023Control). Additionally, MR1's role in presenting cancer-related metabolites makes it a potential target for immunotherapies, as MR1-expressing cancer cells can be targeted by T cells (Rozemuller2021MR1).

## Interactions
MR1 interacts with various proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to facilitate its role in antigen presentation. It forms complexes with β2-microglobulin (β2m), which is essential for its stable conformation and surface expression (Miley2003Biochemical). MR1 also associates with components of the peptide-loading complex (PLC), including tapasin (TPN), ERp57, and calreticulin (CRT), which are crucial for its stabilization and efficient antigen presentation (McWilliam2020Endoplasmic; Lamichhane2017Expression). 

The chaperones TPN and TAPBPR play significant roles in MR1's expression and surface presentation. TPN is particularly important, as its deletion leads to reduced MR1 levels, while TAPBPR's role is more supportive, enhancing MR1 expression in the absence of TPN (McWilliam2020Endoplasmic). MR1 also interacts with the invariant chain (Ii) and DM, which are involved in its trafficking to late endocytic compartments, a process important for the activation of mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells (Huang2008MR1). 

Ligand interactions are critical for MR1's function. Ligands such as 5-OP-RU and Ac-6-FP facilitate MR1's association with β2m, enabling its exit from the ER and subsequent surface expression (Lamichhane2017Expression).
