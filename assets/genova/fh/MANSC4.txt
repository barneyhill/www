# MANSC4

## Overview
The MANSC4 gene encodes the protein MANSC domain containing 4, which is characterized by the presence of a MANSC domain, a motif often associated with cell adhesion and signaling processes. While the precise biological role of the MANSC4 protein remains to be fully elucidated, it is categorized as a protein involved in cellular interactions and signaling pathways. Research has highlighted its potential involvement in various physiological and pathological processes, including its protective role against diabetes and its association with cancer pathologies such as oral squamous cell carcinoma (Qiu2018Pathway; Zou2024Novel). The gene's expression and regulation are of significant interest due to its implications in disease mechanisms and potential as a therapeutic target.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The MANSC4 gene has been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of diabetes. Research by Zou and Yang identified MANSC4 as a significant protein target for type 1 diabetes (T1D) and its complications. Genetically predicted levels of MANSC4 are associated with a decreased risk of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, suggesting a protective role. Lower levels of MANSC4 are linked to an increased risk of T1D and its complications, including coma (Zou2024Novel). The study highlights MANSC4 as a tier 1 target, indicating its importance in T1D, and suggests that alterations in this gene could be linked to the onset and progression of T1D (Zou2024Novel).

In addition to diabetes, MANSC4 has been studied in the context of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The lncRNA MANSC4-8:1 was found to be significantly upregulated in OSCC tissues, suggesting a potential role in the pathology of this cancer. However, the study primarily focuses on lncRNAs and does not provide specific details on the direct association of the MANSC4 gene with OSCC beyond its mention as an upregulated lncRNA (Qiu2018Pathway).
