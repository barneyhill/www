# VCF1

## Overview
VCF1, also known as FAM104A, is a gene that encodes the protein VCP nuclear cofactor family member 1, which is a crucial component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This protein functions as an unconventional cofactor for the p97/VCP protein complex, enhancing its interaction with poly-ubiquitylated proteins and facilitating their turnover. VCP nuclear cofactor family member 1 is characterized by a unique alpha-helical motif, the VCF1 p97-Recognizing Motif (VRM), which allows it to bind with high affinity to the p97 N-domain. This interaction is vital for the nuclear localization of p97, playing a significant role in DNA replication and damage repair, thereby maintaining genome integrity and normal cell growth. The protein is involved in various cellular processes, and its dysregulation has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases and cancer (Mirsanaye2023VCF1; Körner2023The).

## Structure
VCF1, also known as FAM104A, is a protein consisting of 186 amino acids and is conserved across vertebrates (Mirsanaye2023VCF1). The primary structure of VCF1 includes a C-terminal region that is crucial for its interaction with the p97 protein, featuring a novel alpha-helical motif known as the VRM (VCF1 p97-Recognizing Motif) (Mirsanaye2023VCF1; Körner2023The). This motif is characterized by an alpha-helical fold, with key residues such as N167, L170, and H174 essential for binding to the p97 N-domain (Mirsanaye2023VCF1).

The secondary structure of VCF1 is predominantly disordered, except for the C-terminal alpha-helix, which is highly conserved and predicted to adopt an alpha-helical structure (Mirsanaye2023VCF1; Körner2023The). This alpha-helix binds to the subdomain cleft of the p97 N-domain, involving a hydrophobic pocket and a hydrogen bonding network (Körner2023The).

VCF1 exists in several isoforms, with isoforms 1, 2, and 5 containing the C-terminal helix that interacts with p97 (Körner2023The). These isoforms have an N-terminal 74-residue extension found exclusively in eutheria and a 21-residue insertion after residue 107 found in mammals, birds, and reptiles (Körner2023The). The protein does not directly bind ubiquitin but enhances the ubiquitin-binding capacity of the p97-UFD1-NPL4 complex (Mirsanaye2023VCF1).

## Function
VCF1, also known as FAM104A, is an unconventional cofactor for the p97/VCP protein complex, playing a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. It binds to the p97 N-domain with high affinity through a unique alpha-helical motif called the VRM (VCF1 p97-Recognizing Motif), enhancing the interaction of the p97-UFD1-NPL4 complex with poly-ubiquitylated proteins. This interaction promotes the turnover of ubiquitylated substrates, aiding in protein homeostasis and cell fitness, particularly under stress conditions (Mirsanaye2023VCF1).

VCF1 is also involved in the nuclear localization of p97, which is essential for its functions in DNA replication and damage repair. It interacts with p97 through its C-terminal alpha-helix, facilitating the nuclear import of p97 and its association with chromatin. This function is critical for maintaining genome integrity and normal cell growth (Körner2023The). VCF1's expression levels are typically low to maintain a balance with other cofactors, ensuring the proper functioning of the p97-UFD1-NPL4 complex (Mirsanaye2023VCF1).

## Clinical Significance
VCF1 has been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases. It is associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting motor neurons, as identified through systematic yeast two-hybrid screening and computational predictions of protein clusters linked to neurodegenerative diseases (Körner2023The). The protein's role in the nuclear localization of p97, a key player in DNA damage repair, suggests that disruptions in VCF1 function could impact cellular responses to DNA damage, potentially influencing cancer cell survival (Körner2023The).

Alterations in VCF1 expression levels can affect its interaction with p97 and its cofactors, which are crucial for the degradation of ubiquitylated substrates. Overexpression of VCF1 isoform 1 has been shown to slightly reduce cell growth and increase sensitivity to the p97 inhibitor CB-5083, indicating that balanced expression is essential for optimal p97 function (Körner2023The). The loss of VCF1 leads to reduced nuclear p97 levels, impaired cell growth, and increased sensitivity to p97 inhibition, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and genome integrity (Körner2023The). These findings suggest that VCF1 plays a critical role in cellular processes that, when disrupted, may contribute to disease pathogenesis.

## Interactions
VCF1, also known as FAM104A, is a protein that interacts with the p97/VCP protein, forming a complex that is crucial for the recognition and processing of ubiquitylated substrates. VCF1 binds directly to the N-domain of p97 with high affinity through a novel alpha-helical motif known as the VRM (VCF1 p97-Recognizing Motif), which includes essential residues N167, L170, and H174 (Mirsanaye2023VCF1). This interaction enhances the ubiquitin-binding capacity of the p97-UFD1-NPL4 complex, although VCF1 itself does not directly bind ubiquitin (Mirsanaye2023VCF1).

VCF1 can form joint complexes with other cofactors on p97 hexamers, such as UFD1-NPL4, p47, and FAF1. It can bind 2-3 molecules per p97 hexamer, allowing simultaneous binding with other cofactors (Mirsanaye2023VCF1). VCF1 also interacts with auxiliary cofactors like UBXN7 and FAF1, promoting chromatin association of p97 (Körner2023The). The interaction of VCF1 with p97 is characterized by multivalent low-affinity contacts involving disordered regions of VCF1, similar to other p97 cofactors like UBXD1 (Mirsanaye2023VCF1). VCF1 does not interact with nucleic acids (Mirsanaye2023VCF1).
