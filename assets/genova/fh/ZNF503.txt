# ZNF503

## Overview
ZNF503 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 503, a member of the NET family of zinc finger transcription factors. This protein functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor, playing a critical role in the regulation of gene expression. It is involved in various cellular processes, including cell growth, migration, and invasion, by modulating transcriptional networks within the nucleus (den2016A; Lu2019MicroRNA3405p). ZNF503 is particularly important in the differentiation and development of neural and mesodermal tissues, where it interacts with DNA and other proteins to influence cellular differentiation (den2016A). The gene's dysregulation has been linked to the progression of several cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Shahi2015The; p&gt; LncRNA; Qi2020&lt).

## Structure


## Function
ZNF503, also known as zinc finger protein 503, functions as a transcriptional repressor involved in various molecular processes within healthy human cells. It is a member of the NET family of zinc finger transcription factors, which are known for their role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation (den2016A). ZNF503 is involved in modulating gene expression, which is crucial for cellular processes such as cell growth, migration, and invasion (Lu2019MicroRNA3405p). 

The protein is active in the nucleus, where it influences transcriptional networks by interacting with DNA and other proteins. This interaction modulates the expression of target genes, impacting cellular differentiation and development, particularly in neural and mesodermal tissues (den2016A). ZNF503's activity in the cell likely involves interactions with other transcription factors and co-regulators, influencing the transcriptional networks that drive differentiation and development (den2016A).

ZNF503's role as a transcriptional repressor is significant in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating developmental processes. Its involvement in these processes underscores its importance in the proper functioning and development of human tissues (Lu2019MicroRNA3405p).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ZNF503 gene have been implicated in the progression of several cancers. In breast cancer, elevated levels of ZNF503 promote mammary epithelial cell proliferation and invasion by down-regulating E-cadherin, a process dependent on RAC1. This overexpression is associated with increased tumor progression and metastasis, particularly in the context of the MMTV-PyMT transgenic mouse model (Shahi2015The). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ZNF503 is upregulated and contributes to cancer progression by promoting cell proliferation, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The gene is part of a regulatory axis involving TTN-AS1 and miR-491-5p, where TTN-AS1 sponges miR-491-5p to upregulate ZNF503 expression (p&gt; LncRNA; Qi2020&lt). Additionally, ZNF503 is a target of miR-340-5p, a tumor suppressor in NSCLC. Overexpression of ZNF503 can counteract the inhibitory effects of miR-340-5p, suggesting its role in promoting cancer cell growth and invasion (Lu2019MicroRNA3405p). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ZNF503 in cancer development and its potential as a therapeutic target.
