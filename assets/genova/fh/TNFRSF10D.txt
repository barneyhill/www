# TNFRSF10D

## Overview
TNFRSF10D, also known as Decoy Receptor 2 (DcR2), is a gene that encodes a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. The protein product, TNF receptor superfamily member 10d, is a transmembrane receptor characterized by its extracellular cysteine-rich domain, which allows it to bind to the TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Unlike other receptors in its family, TNFRSF10D lacks a functional death domain in its cytoplasmic region, rendering it incapable of initiating apoptosis. Instead, it functions as a decoy receptor, modulating apoptotic signaling by competing with death receptors for TRAIL binding, thereby inhibiting TRAIL-induced apoptosis (Qi2020Hypermethylation; Ekstrand2022Breast). This regulatory role is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and has significant implications in cancer biology, where aberrant methylation of TNFRSF10D can lead to its silencing and contribute to tumor progression (Shivapurkar2004Aberrant).

## Structure
TNFRSF10D, also known as Decoy Receptor 2 (DcR2), is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. The protein is characterized by an extracellular domain containing cysteine-rich motifs, which are typical of the TNF receptor family. This domain is crucial for ligand binding, although TNFRSF10D functions as a decoy receptor and lacks the ability to initiate apoptosis due to the absence of a functional death domain in its cytoplasmic region (Qi2020Hypermethylation). The transmembrane domain anchors the protein in the cell membrane, while the cytoplasmic tail is truncated, distinguishing it from other receptors that can transmit apoptotic signals (Ekstrand2022Breast).

TNFRSF10D may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can influence its stability and interactions with ligands (Qi2020Hypermethylation). The protein does not have a known quaternary structure, as it primarily functions as a monomeric decoy receptor. The lack of a death domain and its role in modulating TNF signaling by competing with other receptors for ligand binding are key features of its structure and function (Ekstrand2022Breast).

## Function
The TNFRSF10D gene encodes a protein that is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. This protein contains an extracellular domain that binds to the TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and a truncated cytoplasmic death domain. In healthy human cells, TNFRSF10D functions as a decoy receptor, inhibiting TRAIL-induced apoptosis by preventing TRAIL from binding to death receptors that would otherwise trigger cell death pathways (Bonazzi2011CrossPlatform). This inhibitory role is crucial for regulating cell survival and maintaining cellular homeostasis.

TNFRSF10D expression is directly regulated by the p53 protein, a key regulator of the cell cycle and apoptosis. This regulation suggests that TNFRSF10D plays a role in cellular responses to stress and damage, potentially influencing chemosensitivity, which is the cell's response to chemical stimuli, including drugs (Bonazzi2011CrossPlatform). The protein is primarily located on the cell surface, where it participates in modulating immune responses and cell survival by acting as a decoy receptor (Ratzinger2014Association). The normal function of TNFRSF10D is essential for preventing inappropriate apoptosis, thereby contributing to the stability of cellular environments.

## Clinical Significance
TNFRSF10D, also known as Decoy Receptor 2 (DcR2), is implicated in various cancers due to its role in apoptosis regulation. Aberrant methylation of TNFRSF10D is frequently observed in multiple tumor types, including breast, lung, mesothelioma, prostate, bladder, cervix, ovary, brain, and hematopoietic malignancies. This methylation leads to gene silencing, which can inhibit apoptosis and contribute to tumor progression (Shivapurkar2004Aberrant). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), TNFRSF10D methylation has been studied as a potential diagnostic marker, although significant differences in methylation levels between tumor and non-tumor tissues were not observed (Qi2020Hypermethylation).

In melanoma, TNFRSF10D methylation serves as an independent prognostic marker for relapse-free survival and overall mortality. The methylation status is associated with more aggressive cancer phenotypes, suggesting its role in cancer progression (Ratzinger2014Association). The silencing of TNFRSF10D through methylation is linked to a lack of mRNA expression, which can be reversed by DNA-demethylating agents, potentially restoring apoptosis and impacting cancer cell growth and survival (Ratzinger2014Association). These findings highlight the clinical significance of TNFRSF10D methylation in cancer prognosis and therapy.

## Interactions
TNFRSF10D, also known as Decoy Receptor 2 (DcR2), is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily that interacts with the TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Unlike other receptors in its family, TNFRSF10D lacks a functional death domain, which prevents it from inducing apoptosis. Instead, it acts as a decoy receptor, inhibiting TRAIL-induced apoptosis by competing with death receptors such as DR4 and DR5 for binding to TRAIL (Qi2020Hypermethylation). This interaction is significant because it modulates the apoptotic signaling pathway, potentially affecting cellular responses to apoptotic stimuli.

The AISID method, which extends AlphaFold-Multimer's capabilities, has been used to predict interactions involving TNFRSF10D. The method identified high AISID scores for the interaction between TNFRSF10D and its ligand TNFSF10 (TRAIL), despite the absence of detailed structural information for TNFRSF10D. This suggests that TNFRSF10D can effectively bind to TRAIL, supporting its role as a decoy receptor (Fu2022AIBased). The AISIDscore was consistent with previous biochemical studies, which reported specific binding of TNFRSF10D to TRAIL with a dissociation constant (K D) of approximately 1 nM (Fu2022AIBased).
