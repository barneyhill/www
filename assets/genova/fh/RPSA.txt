# RPSA

## Overview
RPSA is a gene that encodes the ribosomal protein SA, a multifunctional protein that plays a critical role in various cellular processes. As a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, ribosomal protein SA is essential for ribosome assembly and stability, facilitating mRNA translation and protein synthesis. Beyond its role in ribosomal function, ribosomal protein SA also acts as a cell surface receptor for laminin, influencing cell adhesion, migration, and tissue organization. This protein is involved in signal transduction and has been implicated in the anticarcinous activity of certain compounds. Structurally, ribosomal protein SA is characterized by an N-terminal domain homologous to prokaryotic ribosomal proteins and a C-terminal extension conserved in vertebrates, with the latter being intrinsically disordered. The protein's ability to exist in multiple folding states allows it to perform diverse functions across different cellular compartments (OuldAbeih2012Multiple).

## Structure
The human ribosomal protein SA (RPSA) is a multifunctional protein with a complex molecular structure. It consists of an N-terminal domain homologous to prokaryotic ribosomal proteins S2 and a C-terminal extension conserved in vertebrates (OuldAbeih2012Multiple). The N-domain contains a conserved palindromic sequence and is involved in ribosome maturation and assembly, interacting with 18S rRNA and ribosomal protein S21 (OuldAbeih2012Multiple). The C-domain is intrinsically disordered and shows weak interaction with the N-domain (OuldAbeih2012Multiple).

RPSA exhibits multiple folding states, including native, intermediate, and unfolded states, with the intermediate state being predominant at physiological temperatures (OuldAbeih2012Multiple). The N-domain unfolds according to a three-state equilibrium, while the C-domain shows a noncooperative unfolding pattern (OuldAbeih2012Multiple). Structurally, the N-domain is characterized by α-helices and β-sheets, while the C-domain is mainly composed of random coil residues (OuldAbeih2012Multiple).

RPSA is not glycosylated but undergoes acylation and phosphorylation in vivo, which may influence its activity as a receptor for laminin and other molecules (OuldAbeih2012Multiple). The protein appears in two forms, a 37 kDa precursor and a 67 kDa mature form, with the latter being involved in various cellular processes (OuldAbeih2012Multiple).

## Function
Ribosomal protein SA (RPSA) is a multifunctional protein involved in several critical cellular processes. It is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, playing a vital role in ribosome assembly and stability, which is essential for mRNA translation and protein synthesis (OuldAbeih2012Multiple). RPSA is also involved in ribosome maturation and assembly, interacting with 18S rRNA and ribosomal protein S21 (OuldAbeih2012Multiple).

In cardiomyocytes, RPSA is crucial for maintaining sarcomeric function by localizing ribosomes to the Z-line, facilitating the localized translation of sarcomeric proteins. This process is essential for the spatially explicit incorporation of newly synthesized proteins, which is necessary for maintaining cardiac structure and function (Nagle2024Keeping; Haddad2023Ribosomal). The protein's localization to the sarcomere is dependent on the microtubular network, and its absence leads to mislocalized protein translation and compromised sarcomere integrity (Haddad2023Ribosomal).

RPSA also functions as a cell surface receptor for laminin, influencing cell adhesion, migration, and tissue organization. It is involved in signal transduction and mediates the anticarcinous activity of epigallocatechin gallate (OuldAbeih2012Multiple). The protein's structural plasticity, due to its multiple folding states, allows it to perform various functions across different cellular compartments (OuldAbeih2012Multiple).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RPSA gene are associated with isolated congenital asplenia (ICA), a condition characterized by the absence of a spleen at birth, which increases susceptibility to severe bacterial infections. Studies have identified various mutations in RPSA, including nonsense, frameshift, and missense mutations, which lead to ICA through haploinsufficiency (Bolze2013Ribosomal). A specific missense mutation, R180G, disrupts the protein's structure, impairing spleen development by affecting pre-rRNA processing and ribosome biogenesis (Griffin2018RPSA).

A unique case of ICA was linked to a 337.2 kb deletion encompassing the RPSA gene, highlighting the gene's critical role in spleen development (Oszer2021Germline). This deletion was identified as a de novo mutation, further emphasizing the genetic basis of the condition (Oszer2021Germline).

In cancer biology, RPSA is implicated in tumor invasion and metastasis. It interacts with laminin, promoting cell migration through pathways like PI3K and MAPK. RPSA's role in cancer is further supported by its involvement in telomerase activity and genomic stability, influencing cancer cell proliferation and survival (Limone2023Emerging).

## Interactions
RPSA, also known as ribosomal protein SA, engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It is involved in ribosomal biogenesis, particularly in processing 21S pre-rRNA into mature 18S rRNA, and interacts with ribosomal proteins such as RPS21 (DiGiacomo2015Looking). RPSA associates with the 40S ribosomal subunit and has direct contacts with ribosomal proteins RPS2, RPS17, and RPS21, as well as sparse contact with rRNA (DiGiacomo2015Looking).

RPSA also functions as a receptor for various pathogens, including viruses and bacteria, facilitating their entry into host cells. It interacts with the Zika virus E protein, reducing its ubiquitination and preventing infection (Jiang2024Enolase). In the context of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 infection, RPSA interacts with the virulence factor enolase, promoting biomolecular condensation and apoptosis in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (Jiang2024Enolase).

Additionally, RPSA interacts with cytoskeletal proteins like actin and tubulin, which are involved in forming biomolecular condensates (Jiang2024Enolase). It also binds to elastin-derived peptides, influencing cancer cell invasion and metastasis by modulating MMP-2 secretion and MT1-MMP expression (Bretaudeau2020AG9).
