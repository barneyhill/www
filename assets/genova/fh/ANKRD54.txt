# ANKRD54

## Overview
ANKRD54 is a gene that encodes the ankyrin repeat domain 54 protein, which is primarily recognized for its role as a scaffold or adaptor molecule in cellular signaling pathways. The protein is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, particularly with kinases such as Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) and Lyn kinase. ANKRD54 is involved in the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of BTK, a process crucial for B-lymphocyte development and activation, and is regulated by phosphorylation events that influence its subcellular localization. The protein's ability to interact with SH3 domains of various kinases underscores its significance in immune responses and hematopoiesis (Gustafsson2017ANKRD54; Samuels2017Control).

## Structure
The ANKRD54 protein is characterized by the presence of four ankyrin repeat domains, which are known for their solenoid fold structure. Each ankyrin repeat consists of a β-hairpin followed by two antiparallel α-helices and a variable loop (Gustafsson2017ANKRD54). The secondary structure of ANKRD54 includes a highly conserved GxTPLHLA motif within the internal and C-terminal repeats, while this motif is absent in the N-terminal repeats (Gustafsson2017ANKRD54). 

ANKRD54 contains both a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and a nuclear export signal (NES), which are crucial for its transport between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Samuels2017Control). The protein lacks enzymatic activity and functions primarily as a scaffold or adaptor molecule, interacting with other proteins such as Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) in an SH3-dependent manner (Gustafsson2017ANKRD54). 

Phosphorylation is a common post-translational modification of ANKRD54, particularly involving a serine cluster in the N-terminal region, which influences its subcellular localization (Samuels2017Control). The protein's interaction with other signaling molecules, such as Lyn kinase, is also regulated by phosphorylation (Samuels2017Control). The tertiary and quaternary structures of ANKRD54 are not detailed in the available sources.

## Function
ANKRD54, also known as ankyrin repeat domain 54, is a protein involved in the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), a crucial component in B-lymphocyte development and activation. ANKRD54 interacts with BTK through an SH3-dependent mechanism, modulating its localization by causing nuclear exclusion and cytoplasmic retention of BTK. This interaction is specific to the wild-type form of ANKRD54, as mutants lacking certain ankyrin domains do not affect BTK's distribution (Gustafsson2012Regulation; Gustafsson2017ANKRD54).

ANKRD54 contains functional nuclear localization and export sequences, which are essential for its shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm. This shuttling is regulated by phosphorylation, particularly by the serine/threonine kinase PKCδ, which promotes the cytoplasmic accumulation of ANKRD54. This process is significant in erythropoietin-responsive erythroid cells, where ANKRD54 acts as an adaptor for Tec family tyrosine kinases, including BTK and Txk, interacting with their SH3 domains via ankyrin repeats (Samuels2017Control).

ANKRD54's interaction with BTK is crucial for understanding its role in cellular signaling pathways, particularly in the context of immune responses and hematopoiesis (Gustafsson2017ANKRD54).

## Interactions
ANKRD54, also known as Lyn-interacting ankyrin repeat protein (Liar), is involved in several protein-protein interactions, primarily through its ankyrin repeat domains. These domains facilitate interactions with the SH3 domains of various kinases, including Lyn, Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), and Tec family kinases such as Txk/Rlk. ANKRD54 interacts with the SH3 domain of Lyn kinase, co-localizing with active Lyn, particularly its constitutively active form, in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments depending on the cell type and conditions (Samuels2017Control).

In erythroid cells, ANKRD54 and Lyn co-localize in nuclear speckles following erythropoietin stimulation, while in HEK293 cells, they are found in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane. This interaction is modulated by phosphorylation, which affects ANKRD54's subcellular localization (Samuels2017Control).

ANKRD54 also interacts with Btk, mediating its nuclear export in an SH3-dependent manner. This interaction is specific, as ANKRD54 does not affect the shuttling of other nuclear proteins like Abl or estrogen receptor β (Gustafsson2012Regulation). ANKRD54's interaction with Btk involves its ankyrin repeats, which bind to the SH3 domain of Btk, facilitating the export of Btk from the nucleus (Gustafsson2012Regulation).
