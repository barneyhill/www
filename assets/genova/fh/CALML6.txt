# CALML6

## Overview
CALML6, or calmodulin-like 6, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the calmodulin family, which is known for its role in calcium-binding and signaling. The protein calmodulin-like 6 is involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of cancer biology. It functions as a signaling molecule that interacts with calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CaMKK2), playing a pivotal role in pathways that regulate cell migration and mitochondrial function, especially in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) (Ishikawa2024EP4induced). The CALML6 protein is implicated in the EP4/CALML6/CaMKK2/AMPK signaling pathway, which is crucial for cancer cell migration and metastasis (Ishikawa2024EP4induced). Additionally, CALML6 is involved in the oxytocin signaling pathway in gastric cancer, where its expression is regulated by the BRD9 gene, contributing to anti-apoptotic effects (Wang2019BRD9; Wang2020BRD9). These interactions highlight CALML6 as a potential therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
CALML6 (calmodulin-like 6) has been implicated in the progression of certain cancers due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), CALML6 is upregulated in response to EP4 receptor activation, which increases intracellular calcium levels and promotes cell migration and metastasis. This process is mediated through the EP4/CALML6/CaMKK2/AMPK signaling pathway, suggesting that CALML6 plays a significant role in cancer cell migration and metastasis (Ishikawa2024EP4induced). Knockdown of CALML6 in OSCC cells has been shown to reduce cell migration, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Ishikawa2024EP4induced).

In gastric cancer, CALML6 is involved in the oxytocin signaling pathway, regulated by the BRD9 gene. Overexpression of CALML6, influenced by BRD9, contributes to anti-apoptotic effects and inhibits oxytocin production, which is associated with cancer progression. Inhibiting BRD9 can downregulate CALML6, promoting apoptosis and potentially reducing cancer risk (Wang2019BRD9; Wang2020BRD9). These findings suggest that CALML6 is a critical component in pathways that contribute to cancer progression, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention. However, the clinical significance of CALML6 gene mutations in other diseases is not well-documented in the current literature.

## Interactions
CALML6, also known as calmodulin-like 6, is involved in protein-protein interactions that play a significant role in the migration of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells. It is directly associated with calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CaMKK2) as part of a signaling pathway. This interaction is crucial for the EP4-induced phosphorylation of CaMKK2 and subsequently AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which are key processes in cell migration (Ishikawa2024EP4induced). The EP4/CALML6/CaMKK2/AMPK pathway is proposed to contribute to OSCC progression by enhancing mitochondrial function and cell migration (Ishikawa2024EP4induced).

The study also constructed a protein-protein interaction network using the STRING database, which confirmed the direct association between CALML6 and CaMKK2 (Ishikawa2024EP4induced). However, specific physical interactions of CALML6 with nucleic acids or other proteins beyond this pathway are not detailed in the available context (Ishikawa2024EP4induced). The role of CALML6 in these interactions highlights its potential as a therapeutic target in OSCC treatment (Ishikawa2024EP4induced).
