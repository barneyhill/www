# EIF4EBP3

## Overview
EIF4EBP3 is a gene that encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 3, a crucial regulatory protein involved in the control of protein synthesis. This protein functions as a translational repressor by interacting with eIF4E, a cap-binding protein necessary for the initiation of mRNA translation. By binding to eIF4E, EIF4EBP3 inhibits the formation of the eIF4F complex, thereby reducing cap-dependent translation (Poulin19984EBP3; Tsukumo2016Translation). The activity of EIF4EBP3 is modulated by its phosphorylation state, allowing it to dynamically respond to cellular signals and stress conditions (Poulin19984EBP3). It plays a significant role in cellular growth and proliferation, acting as a tumor suppressor in certain cancers, such as gastric cancer, by inhibiting the translation of oncogenic proteins (Zhai2019eIF4EBP3). Additionally, EIF4EBP3 is involved in the cellular response to mTORC1 inhibition, making it a potential biomarker for therapeutic responses in cancer treatment (Tsukumo2016Translation).

## Function
EIF4EBP3 encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 3, which plays a crucial role in regulating protein synthesis in healthy human cells. This protein functions as a translational repressor by binding to eIF4E, a cap-binding protein essential for the initiation of mRNA translation. By binding to eIF4E, EIF4EBP3 prevents its association with eIF4G, thereby inhibiting the formation of the eIF4F complex and reducing cap-dependent translation (Poulin19984EBP3; Tsukumo2016Translation).

The activity of EIF4EBP3 is regulated by its phosphorylation state; underphosphorylated forms bind to eIF4E, while hyperphosphorylated forms do not, allowing for dynamic control of translation in response to cellular signals (Poulin19984EBP3). This regulation is particularly important during mTORC1 inhibition, where EIF4EBP3 is transcriptionally induced by the transcription factor TFE3, leading to increased binding to eIF4E and further suppression of cap-dependent translation (Tsukumo2016Translation).

EIF4EBP3 is active in the cytoplasm and is involved in cellular stress responses and metabolic regulation, contributing to the control of cell growth and proliferation by modulating the availability of eIF4E for translation initiation (Poulin19984EBP3; Tsukumo2016Translation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the EIF4EBP3 gene have been implicated in various cancers, particularly gastric cancer (GC). In GC, EIF4EBP3 acts as a tumor suppressor gene and is frequently downregulated due to promoter region hypermethylation. This downregulation is associated with poor survival rates and increased tumor progression. The gene's suppression leads to enhanced eIF4E-mediated β-catenin translation, a pathway known to promote cancer progression. Reactivating EIF4EBP3 expression through demethylation has been suggested as a potential therapeutic approach for GC treatment (Zhai2019eIF4EBP3).

In the context of parathyroid cancer syndrome, EIF4EBP3 serves as a marker for CDC73 tumor suppressor haploinsufficiency. Reduced expression of EIF4EBP3 is observed in patients with CDC73 heterozygosity, which is linked to increased susceptibility to hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome and parathyroid malignancy. This suggests that EIF4EBP3 could be used to assess CDC73 allele dosage in clinical settings (Zhang2012The).

EIF4EBP3 is also involved in the response to mTORC1 inhibition in cancer therapy. Its expression is induced during prolonged mTORC1 inhibition, and it acts as a negative regulator of cell proliferation, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for therapeutic response in cancer treatment (Tsukumo2016Translation).

## Interactions
EIF4EBP3, a member of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein family, interacts primarily with eIF4E, a key player in cap-dependent translation. This interaction inhibits the assembly of the eIF4F complex, thereby regulating translation initiation. The binding of EIF4EBP3 to eIF4E is mediated by a common eIF4E binding motif, which is also the site of phosphorylation in related proteins like 4E-BP1 (Poulin19984EBP3). Mutations in the eIF4E binding site of EIF4EBP3, such as Tyr-40 to alanine and Leu-45 to alanine, abolish its interaction with eIF4E, highlighting the specificity of this interaction (Poulin19984EBP3).

In gastric cancer, EIF4EBP3 acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting the eIF4E-mediated translation of β-catenin, a protein involved in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This interaction is crucial for its tumor suppressive function, as it sequesters eIF4E from the eIF4F complex, thereby inhibiting the translation of mRNAs that promote cell proliferation and survival (Zhai2019eIF4EBP3).

EIF4EBP3 is also involved in the regulation of translation during mTORC1 inhibition. It binds to eIF4E, limiting cap-dependent translation, which is crucial for controlling the translation of specific mRNAs and affecting cell proliferation and survival (Tsukumo2016Translation).
