# CSHL1

## Overview
The CSHL1 gene, located within the human growth hormone/chorionic somatomammotropin (hGH/CSH) gene cluster on chromosome 17q22-24, is a member of a group of genes primarily expressed in the placenta. This gene cluster plays a significant role in maternal metabolic adaptation and fetal growth during pregnancy (Sedman2008Complex; Männik2012Differential). The CSHL1 gene is notable for its expression in the placenta; however, it is classified as a pseudogene due to the absence of a functional protein product. This is attributed to alternative splicing events that result in mRNA lacking a signal peptide coding exon, thereby preventing the expression of a secreted protein (Männik2012Differential). Despite its expression, the precise biological functions of CSHL1 remain elusive, and it exhibits greater genetic diversity compared to other genes in the placental gene cluster (Sedman2008Complex).

## Function
The CSHL1 gene is part of the human growth hormone/chorionic somatomammotropin (hGH/CSH) gene cluster located on chromosome 17q22-24. This gene cluster includes several genes expressed in the placenta, such as GH2, CSH1, CSH2, and CSHL1, which are crucial for maternal metabolic adaptation during pregnancy and fetal growth (Sedman2008Complex; Männik2012Differential). CSHL1 is expressed in the placenta, but no protein has been reported, likely due to alternative splicing that results in mRNA lacking a signal peptide coding exon, preventing the expression of a secreted protein (Männik2012Differential).

The CSHL1 gene is involved in regulating fetal glucose supply and growth, as well as maternal metabolism, contributing to the complex genomic structure of the hGH/CSH region, which has evolved through multiple duplication events (Sedman2008Complex). Despite its expression, the specific functional implications or roles of CSHL1 in healthy human cells remain unclear, as the gene is considered a pseudogene with higher diversity compared to other placental genes (Sedman2008Complex).
