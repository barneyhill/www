# FBXO5

## Overview
FBXO5 is a gene that encodes the F-box protein 5, a critical regulatory protein involved in cell cycle control. As a member of the F-box protein family, it functions as part of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex, which is essential for targeting specific proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. F-box protein 5, also known as Early mitotic inhibitor 1 (Emi1), plays a pivotal role in inhibiting the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), thereby regulating the transition from metaphase to anaphase during cell division. This regulation is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and proper cell cycle progression (Uddin2016Involvement; Liu2018Two). Beyond its role in cell cycle regulation, FBXO5 is involved in various cellular processes, including osteogenic differentiation and cancer progression, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Liu2018Two; Ji2024FBXO5mediated).

## Function
FBXO5, also known as F-box protein 5 or Early mitotic inhibitor 1 (Emi1), is a crucial component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex. It plays a significant role in regulating the cell cycle by inhibiting the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), thereby controlling the transition from metaphase to anaphase. This inhibition is essential for proper cell division and maintaining genomic stability (Uddin2016Involvement; Liu2018Two).

In healthy human cells, FBXO5 is involved in stabilizing key proteins necessary for cell replication, such as cyclin A and geminin, which are crucial for cell proliferation (Uddin2016Involvement). It is active in the nucleus, where it promotes S-phase and M-phase entry by inhibiting APC/C activity, ensuring the orderly progression of the cell cycle (Liu2018Two).

FBXO5 also plays a role in the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells, which is beneficial for tissue regeneration. It enhances the migration and differentiation potential of human periodontal ligament stem cells, indicating its involvement in cellular processes beyond cell cycle regulation (Liu2018Two).

## Clinical Significance
FBXO5 (F-box protein 5) has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in cell cycle regulation and its interactions with other cellular pathways. In cervical cancer, FBXO5 is significantly overexpressed, correlating with poor survival rates and higher tumor mutational burden (TMB). This overexpression is associated with increased cell proliferation and migration, as well as reduced responsiveness to certain chemotherapeutic agents like Rapamycin and Pazopanib, though it increases sensitivity to others such as Cetuximab and Erlotinib (Jiang2023FBXO5).

In colon cancer, FBXO5 prevents apoptosis induced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by inhibiting key signaling pathways. Its overexpression leads to decreased apoptosis and enhanced tumor growth, suggesting its role in oncogenesis. FBXO5 interacts with RNF183, regulating its ubiquitination and stability, which further promotes cancer cell survival (Ji2024FBXO5mediated).

FBXO5 is also overexpressed in breast cancer, where it is associated with poor prognosis and survival outcomes. It acts as an oncogene by inhibiting the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), stabilizing oncogenic substrates, and promoting cell cycle progression (Liu2021Systematica). Across various cancers, FBXO5 expression is linked to immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint regulation, indicating its potential as a biomarker for immunotherapy response (Liu2022Prognostic).

## Interactions
FBXO5, also known as F-box protein 5, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cell cycle regulation and cancer progression. FBXO5 is a component of the SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F-box) ubiquitin ligase complex, where it interacts with Skp1 and Cullin proteins to facilitate the ubiquitination and degradation of target proteins (Ji2024FBXO5mediated). This interaction is essential for regulating cell cycle progression by inhibiting the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) activity, thereby preventing premature anaphase entry (Jiang2023FBXO5).

FBXO5 also interacts with RNF183, a member of the RING E3 family located in the endoplasmic reticulum. This interaction is significant in colon cancer progression, as FBXO5 regulates the stability and ubiquitination of RNF183, promoting its degradation. This process prevents endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis in colon cancer cells (Ji2024FBXO5mediated). The interaction between FBXO5 and RNF183 was confirmed through endogenous immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down experiments, which demonstrated direct binding (Ji2024FBXO5mediated).

Additionally, FBXO5 interacts with the transcription factor E2F2, which regulates its expression. E2F2 binds to the promoter region of FBXO5, influencing its transcriptional activity (Ji2024FBXO5mediated). These interactions highlight FBXO5's role in both protein degradation pathways and transcriptional regulation.
