# MDH1

## Overview
MDH1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme malate dehydrogenase 1, a cytosolic protein that plays a pivotal role in cellular energy metabolism. As a key component of the citric acid cycle, malate dehydrogenase 1 catalyzes the reversible conversion of L-malate to oxaloacetate, a reaction that is crucial for the malate-aspartate shuttle and overall cellular energy homeostasis (Oh2016Cytosolic; Haberman2024Genetics). This enzyme is highly expressed in tissues with significant energy demands, such as the heart, skeletal muscle, and brain, underscoring its importance in aerobic energy production (Lo2004Developmental). Beyond its metabolic functions, malate dehydrogenase 1 interacts with various proteins, including the tumor suppressor p53, influencing processes such as cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Lee2009A). The enzyme's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as acetylation, which enhance its function and are critical for processes like adipogenic differentiation (Kim2012Acetylation). MDH1's involvement in disease states, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, highlights its clinical significance (Haberman2024Genetics; Zerr2019Evaluation).

## Structure
The human gene MDH1 encodes the cytosolic malate dehydrogenase 1 enzyme, which plays a crucial role in the citric acid cycle by catalyzing the conversion of malate to oxaloacetate. The primary structure of MDH1 consists of 334 amino acids, as revealed by its cDNA sequence (Lo2004Developmental). The secondary structure of MDH1 includes both α-helices and β-sheets, which are common features in proteins involved in energy metabolism (Lo2004Developmental).

MDH1 is known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as acetylation, which significantly enhances its enzymatic activity and is crucial for processes like adipogenic differentiation. Specific acetylation sites identified in MDH1 include lysine residues K118, K121, and K298 (Kim2012Acetylation). These modifications play a regulatory role in the enzyme's function and are associated with changes in intracellular NADPH levels during adipogenesis (Kim2012Acetylation).

The quaternary structure of MDH1 is not explicitly detailed in the provided context, but the enzyme is typically found in a dimeric form, similar to other malate dehydrogenases. The protein's structure is highly conserved across species, maintaining its functional integrity despite variations in amino acid sequences (Lo2004Developmental).

## Function
Malate dehydrogenase 1 (MDH1) is a cytosolic enzyme that plays a critical role in cellular energy metabolism. It catalyzes the reversible conversion of L-malate to oxaloacetate, a reaction that is NADH-dependent, and is a key component of the citric acid cycle and the malate-aspartate shuttle (Oh2016Cytosolic; Haberman2024Genetics). This shuttle is essential for transferring reducing equivalents across the mitochondrial membrane, thereby maintaining the balance of NAD+/NADH in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, which is crucial for ATP production and overall cellular energy homeostasis (Oh2016Cytosolic).

MDH1 is highly expressed in tissues with high energy demands, such as the heart, skeletal muscle, and brain, reflecting its role in supporting aerobic energy production and various metabolic processes (Lo2004Developmental). In addition to its metabolic functions, MDH1 interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, influencing its nuclear localization and transcriptional activity, which is independent of MDH1's enzymatic activity (Haberman2024Genetics). This interaction is significant in regulating cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, particularly under conditions of metabolic stress such as glucose deprivation (Lee2009A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the MDH1 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. MDH1 is associated with cancer, as it interacts with the cell cycle regulator p53, affecting its nuclear localization and transcriptional activation, independent of its enzymatic activity (Haberman2024Genetics). This interaction suggests a role in tumorigenesis. Additionally, MDH1 has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in neurological health (Haberman2024Genetics).

In the context of genetic prion diseases, elevated levels of MDH1 in cerebrospinal fluid have been observed in patients with genetic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (gCJD), particularly those with E200K and V210I mutations in the PRNP gene. This elevation suggests that MDH1 could serve as a diagnostic marker for certain prion diseases (Zerr2019Evaluation).

Oxidative damage to MDH1, particularly the trioxidation of cysteine residue Cys137, has been linked to age-related bioenergetic dysfunctions in the brain. This damage impairs MDH1's enzymatic activity, contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular stress during aging, which may be relevant to neurodegenerative conditions (Guo2020Oxidative).

## Interactions
MDH1 (malate dehydrogenase 1) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. One notable interaction is with the tumor suppressor protein p53. Under conditions of metabolic stress, such as glucose deprivation, MDH1 binds to p53, particularly at the DNA-binding domain of p53 and the C-terminal region of MDH1. This interaction stabilizes p53 by reducing its ubiquitination and preventing its nuclear export mediated by Mdm2, a ubiquitin ligase. MDH1 also acts as a transcriptional co-activator for p53, enhancing the expression of p53-downstream genes like Bax, p21, and Noxa (Lee2009A).

In the context of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), MDH1 is involved in regulating autophagy. It maintains the levels of ULK1, a key protein in the autophagy pathway, by preventing its proteasomal degradation. This regulation is crucial for autophagy-dependent PDAC cell survival, highlighting MDH1's role in autophagic processes (New2019MDH1).

In plants, MDH1 interacts with other proteins involved in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, such as citrate synthase (CSY) 4 and fumarase (FUM) 1, forming part of a broader network of interactions that facilitate metabolite channelling (Zhang2017Proteinprotein).
