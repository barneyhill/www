# SLAMF8

## Overview
SLAMF8, or Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family Member 8, is a gene that encodes a type I transmembrane protein belonging to the SLAM family of receptors. The protein, also known as CD353 or BLAME, is characterized by its extracellular domain containing two immunoglobulin-like domains, which include a V-like variable domain and a C2-like constant domain. Unlike other SLAM family members, SLAMF8 lacks intracellular tyrosine-based switch motifs (ITSM), which are typically involved in signaling, suggesting a unique functional role possibly as an adhesive receptor due to its short cytoplasmic tail (Farhangnia2023SLAMfamily; Guselnikov2011Expansion). SLAMF8 is predominantly expressed on immune cells such as monocytes, dendritic cells, and neutrophils, where it plays a crucial role in regulating inflammation and immune responses by modulating reactive oxygen species formation and cell migration (Farhangnia2023SLAMfamily). The protein's involvement in various signaling pathways and its expression in different cell types underscore its significance in both normal immune function and pathological conditions.

## Structure
SLAMF8, also known as CD353 or BLAME, is a type I transmembrane protein that is part of the SLAM family of receptors. It is characterized by an extracellular domain with two immunoglobulin-like domains: a V-like variable domain and a C2-like constant domain (Yigit2019SLAMF6; Farhangnia2023SLAMfamily). Unlike most SLAM family members, SLAMF8 lacks the intracellular tyrosine-based switch motifs (ITSM), which are typically involved in signaling through interactions with adaptor proteins like SAP and EAT-2 (Yigit2019SLAMF6; Farhangnia2023SLAMfamily). This absence suggests that SLAMF8 may function differently from other SLAM receptors, potentially serving as an adhesive receptor due to its short cytoplasmic tail (Guselnikov2011Expansion).

SLAMF8 is expressed on various immune cells, including monocytes, dendritic cells, and neutrophils, and plays a role in regulating inflammation by acting as a negative regulator of reactive oxygen species formation and cell migration (Farhangnia2023SLAMfamily). The protein is also expressed in T cells and NK cells, but weakly in B cells, with restricted expression in plasmablasts and plasma cells (Farhangnia2023SLAMfamily). Specific details about post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of SLAMF8 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
SLAMF8 (SLAM family member 8) is a protein involved in the regulation of immune responses and cellular differentiation processes. It is primarily expressed on myeloid cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, and plays a role in modulating immune cell behavior (Shachar2019SLAMF). In macrophages, SLAMF8 negatively regulates the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by downregulating NADPH oxidase activation, which is crucial for controlling inflammation and immune responses (RomeroPinedo2022SLAMF8). This regulation occurs through the PI3K pathway, where SLAMF8 modulates the activation of small Rho GTPases and the assembly of NOX2 subunits, thereby influencing macrophage activation and microbicidal mechanisms (RomeroPinedo2022SLAMF8).

SLAMF8 also plays a significant role in the differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). It promotes osteogenic differentiation while inhibiting adipogenic differentiation through the Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway. This is achieved by influencing the expression of key transcription factors such as RUNX2 and PPARγ, which are involved in osteogenesis and adipogenesis, respectively (Wang2024SLAMF8). SLAMF8's involvement in these processes suggests its potential role in bone formation and mineralization, as well as in fracture healing (Wang2024SLAMF8).

## Clinical Significance
SLAMF8 (SLAM family member 8) has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In the context of acute renal transplant rejection, SLAMF8 is significantly upregulated in acute rejection samples compared to stable transplant samples. It plays a role in the TLR4 pathway on pro-inflammatory macrophages, contributing to the inflammatory response during acute rejection (Teng2022SLAMF8). This suggests its potential as a biomarker for diagnosing and treating allograft rejection (Teng2022SLAMF8).

In cancer, SLAMF8 expression is associated with tumor progression and immune response modulation. In glioblastoma, its overexpression correlates with tumor progression, higher grade glioma, reduced overall survival, and chemoresistance, indicating an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (Gunes2024Signaling). Conversely, in gastric cancer, high SLAMF8 expression is linked to better responses to anti-PD-1 therapy, particularly in cases with Epstein-Barr virus infection (Gunes2024Signaling). In anaplastic large cell lymphoma, SLAMF8 enhances cell growth through interaction with SHP-2, and its knockdown results in decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis (Sugimoto2020SLAM). These findings highlight SLAMF8's role in various pathological conditions, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
SLAMF8 (SLAM family member 8) is involved in various interactions that modulate immune responses. It is known to interact with the TLR4 pathway on pro-inflammatory macrophages, contributing to acute renal transplant rejection by maintaining TLR4 expression and promoting LPS-induced MAPK activation (Teng2022SLAMF8). SLAMF8 also interacts with SLAMF9 and TLR4, influencing the immune response to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) through the TLR4 receptor in mice (RomeroPinedo2022SLAMF8).

SLAMF8 is part of a complex interplay with other SLAM family receptors. Although it does not have an intracellular domain with known signaling motifs, it is speculated to competitively inhibit SLAMF1. The absence of SLAMF8 facilitates the formation of the SLAMF1-Beclin1-Vps34/15-UVRAG complex, indicating a functional interplay between SLAMF1 and SLAMF8 (van2016Responses).

SLAMF8 also plays a role in regulating the activity of the NOX2 complex by negatively regulating PKC-δ, which phosphorylates the p40 phox subunit, thereby reducing superoxide production (van2016Responses). This interaction highlights SLAMF8's role in modulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and immune cell migration (Wang2015Migration).
