# ACTL10

## Overview
ACTL10 is a gene that encodes the protein actin-like 10, which is a member of the actin family of proteins. Actin-like proteins are involved in various cellular processes, including the maintenance of cell shape, motility, and intracellular transport. Although the specific functions of actin-like 10 are not fully elucidated, it is believed to play a role in cellular structural integrity and dynamics. The gene has been studied in the context of its involvement in DNA methylation and autophagy, particularly in relation to developmental disorders and cancer. Alterations in ACTL10 expression or methylation have been associated with clinical conditions such as transient neonatal diabetes and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, highlighting its potential significance in both developmental biology and oncology (Ma2022Autophagy; Bak2016Genomewide).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
ACTL10 has been implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly in relation to its role in DNA methylation and autophagy. In patients with transient neonatal diabetes type 1 (TND) who have mutations in the ZFP57 gene, ACTL10 was found to be hypomethylated in all heterozygotes studied. This hypomethylation may be involved in the regulation of exonic inclusion/exclusion or represent 'orphan promoters' used in early development, suggesting a potential role in developmental disorders (Bak2016Genomewide).

In the context of cancer, ACTL10 is part of an autophagy phenotype-related signature (ATGscore) used to quantify autophagy patterns in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). A low ATGscore, which includes ACTL10, is associated with better prognosis and enriched immune infiltration pathways. Conversely, a high ATGscore correlates with poorer outcomes and stromal activation pathways, indicating that ACTL10 may play a role in the tumor immune microenvironment and influence cancer progression and patient prognosis (Ma2022Autophagy). These findings suggest that alterations in ACTL10 expression or methylation could have significant implications for both developmental and cancer-related conditions.
