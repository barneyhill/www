# SPIDR

## Overview
The SPIDR gene encodes a scaffold protein involved in DNA repair, playing a pivotal role in the homologous recombination (HR) pathway, which is essential for maintaining genomic stability. The protein encoded by SPIDR is a key component of the SWS1-SWSAP1-SPIDR complex, which is crucial for inter-homolog homologous recombination but not necessary for intrachromosomal homologous DNA repair. This complex facilitates the assembly of RAD51 recombinase at sites of DNA damage, promoting the formation of stable recombination intermediates. SPIDR functions primarily in the nucleus, where it interacts with various proteins, including RAD51 and the Shu complex, to ensure accurate DNA repair and cell cycle progression. Its role is particularly significant in the context of replication-associated damage, contributing to genomic integrity and proper cell division (Martino2019The; Prakash2021Distinct; SmirinYosef2016A).

## Function
The SPIDR gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in homologous recombination (HR), a key DNA repair pathway essential for maintaining genomic stability. SPIDR is part of the SWS1-SWSAP1-SPIDR complex, which is vital for inter-homolog homologous recombination (IH-HR) but not required for intrachromosomal homologous DNA repair (HDR) (Prakash2021Distinct). This complex facilitates the stable assembly of RAD51 recombinase at DNA damage sites, promoting the formation of stable recombination intermediates like double Holliday junctions (Prakash2021Distinct).

SPIDR acts as a scaffolding protein, interacting with RAD51 and potentially influencing the assembly of DNA repair complexes, although it lacks identified protein motifs (Martino2019The; Prakash2021Distinct). It is also involved in regulating RAD51 foci formation, which is essential for DNA repair processes (Martino2019The). The protein is primarily active in the nucleus, where it ensures accurate DNA repair and cell cycle progression (Martino2019The).

In healthy human cells, SPIDR's function in HR is critical for the repair of double-strand breaks, contributing to genomic stability and proper cell division (SmirinYosef2016A). Its role in DNA repair is particularly significant in the context of replication-associated damage, where it helps maintain genome integrity (Martino2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the SPIDR gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. A biallelic nonsense mutation in SPIDR was identified in two sisters from an Israeli consanguineous family, leading to delayed puberty and premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) (Ding2023DNA; SmirinYosef2016A). Another SPIDR homozygous nonsense mutation was found in an Indian patient with idiopathic POI, suggesting that aberrant expression of SPIDR may contribute to this condition (Ding2023DNA). These mutations potentially cause nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, resulting in genomic instability and impaired DNA repair mechanisms (SmirinYosef2016A).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SPIDR expression is up-regulated, which is associated with poor recurrence-free survival. This up-regulation is controlled by nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) and super enhancers, indicating a role in protecting HCC cells from oxidative stress (Liu2024Nuclear). Silencing SPIDR in HCC cells increases reactive oxygen species levels, suggesting its involvement in the oxidative stress response (Liu2024Nuclear).

The SWS1-SWSAP1-SPIDR complex is crucial for homologous recombination repair. Disruption of this complex can lead to increased sister chromatid exchanges and genomic instability, potentially contributing to conditions like Bloom syndrome (Prakash2020Distinct).

## Interactions
SPIDR, a scaffold protein involved in DNA repair, participates in several critical interactions with other proteins, particularly within the context of homologous recombination. It forms a complex with SWS1 and SWSAP1, known as the SWS1-SWSAP1-SPIDR complex, which is essential for homologous recombination during meiosis. This complex interacts with RAD51 and DMC1, key proteins in DNA repair and meiosis, facilitating the formation of RAD51 and DMC1 nucleoprotein filaments at resected DNA ends (Prakash2021Distinct).

SPIDR also interacts with the Shu complex, where it functions alongside PDS5B to promote RAD51-mediated homologous recombination. This interaction is crucial for maintaining genome stability and processing DNA damage during replication (Martino2019The). The N terminus of SPIDR (1-515 amino acids) mediates its interactions with SWS1, SWSAP1, and RAD51, suggesting a scaffolding role in these complexes (Martino2019The).

In addition to these interactions, SPIDR has been identified as a binding partner of BLM, a helicase involved in resolving recombination intermediates, indicating its involvement in the same pathway as BLM in human cells (Prakash2021Distinct). These interactions highlight SPIDR's integral role in DNA repair processes.
