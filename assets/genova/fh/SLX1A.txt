# SLX1A

## Overview
SLX1A is a gene that encodes the protein SLX1 homolog A, which functions as a structure-specific endonuclease subunit. This protein is a critical component of the SLX1-SLX4 complex, a heterodimeric enzyme involved in DNA repair processes. SLX1 homolog A serves as the catalytic subunit within this complex, playing a pivotal role in resolving complex DNA structures such as Holliday junctions, which are crucial intermediates in homologous recombination and DNA repair pathways (Payliss2021Exploring). The interaction between SLX1A and SLX4 is essential for the catalytic activity of the complex, with SLX4 acting as a scaffold that stabilizes the heterodimer and coordinates the activity of other nucleases involved in DNA repair (Muñoz2009Coordination). This coordination is vital for maintaining genomic stability, particularly during the processing of recombination intermediates and at stalled replication forks (Muñoz2009Coordination).

## Function


## Interactions
SLX1A is a component of the SLX1-SLX4 complex, a structure-specific endonuclease involved in DNA repair processes. It interacts with SLX4, forming a heterodimer that is essential for its catalytic activity. The interaction between SLX1A and SLX4 is facilitated by the conserved C-terminal domain of SLX4, which stabilizes the SLX1-SLX4 heterodimer (Payliss2021Exploring). This complex is crucial for resolving various DNA structures, such as Holliday junctions, which are intermediates in homologous recombination and DNA repair (Payliss2021Exploring).

SLX1A also interacts with other proteins involved in DNA repair, including MUS81 and EME1. These interactions are part of a larger network of nucleases coordinated by SLX4, which acts as a scaffold to enhance the activity of these enzymes on branched DNA substrates (Muñoz2009Coordination). The SLX1-SLX4 complex is involved in processing recombination intermediates and flaps that arise during homologous recombination and at stalled replication forks (Muñoz2009Coordination).

The SLX1-SLX4 complex is an obligate heterodimer, with SLX1A serving as the catalytic subunit and SLX4 as the non-catalytic scaffold, highlighting the importance of their interaction for maintaining genome stability (Payliss2021Exploring).
