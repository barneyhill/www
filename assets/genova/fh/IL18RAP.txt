# IL18RAP

## Overview
The IL18RAP gene encodes the interleukin 18 receptor accessory protein, a critical component of the interleukin-18 receptor complex. This protein is categorized as a receptor and plays a pivotal role in the immune system by facilitating the binding of interleukin-18 (IL-18) to its receptor, IL18R1, thereby enhancing IL-18 signaling. This signaling is crucial for the activation of natural killer (NK) cells and T-helper 1 (Th1) cells, which are essential for the production of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), a key cytokine in immune responses. IL18RAP is involved in various physiological processes, including the regulation of inflammatory responses and the maintenance of intestinal epithelial barrier integrity. It is expressed on immune cells such as macrophages and neutrophils, and its activity is linked to the activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB) through the Myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MYD88) pathway (Zehra2019IL18RAP; Chen2023Prognostic; Zhernakova2008Genetic).

## Function
The IL18RAP gene encodes the interleukin 18 receptor accessory protein, which is a critical component of the interleukin-18 receptor complex. This protein plays a significant role in immune response regulation by facilitating the binding of interleukin-18 (IL-18) to its receptor, IL18R1, thereby enabling IL-18 signaling. This signaling pathway is essential for the activation of natural killer (NK) cells and T-helper 1 (Th1) cells, promoting the production of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), a key cytokine in immune responses (Chen2023Prognostic; MartínezBarquero2017AreIL18RAPgene).

IL18RAP is involved in various physiological processes, including the regulation of inflammatory responses and the maintenance of intestinal epithelial barrier integrity. It is expressed on immune cells, such as macrophages and neutrophils, and is crucial for their activation and cytokine production (Zehra2019IL18RAP; Zhernakova2008Genetic). The protein's activity is linked to the activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB) through the Myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MYD88) pathway, leading to the transcription of downstream target genes involved in immune responses (Zehra2019IL18RAP).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IL18RAP gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), such as Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), have shown a significant association with IL18RAP. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the IL18RAP gene, such as rs917997, are linked to an increased risk of developing these conditions. The gene's involvement in the activation of the NF-kB pathway, a central element in CD pathogenesis, suggests that changes in IL18RAP expression or function could contribute to the inflammatory processes observed in these diseases (Zhernakova2008Genetic).

In cancer, IL18RAP is abnormally expressed and linked to tumor immunity. It is associated with immune cell infiltration and can predict immunotherapy response. Alterations in IL18RAP, such as missense mutations, are common in cancers like skin cutaneous melanoma and lung adenocarcinoma, and these mutations are linked to poorer prognoses in certain cancers (Chen2023Prognostic). Additionally, IL18RAP polymorphisms may influence susceptibility to obesity by modifying IL-18 signaling, which is elevated in obesity and metabolic syndrome (MartínezBarquero2017AreIL18RAPgene).

## Interactions
IL18RAP (interleukin 18 receptor accessory protein) is a component of the interleukin-18 receptor complex, which plays a crucial role in immune response signaling. It forms a heteromeric receptor complex with IL18R1, facilitating the binding of interleukin-18 (IL18) and enhancing IL18 signaling. This interaction is significant in cancer biology, as it promotes tumor initiation and progression through pro-inflammatory effects (Zhao2022Key). IL18RAP is involved in the interleukin-18-mediated signaling pathway, participating in molecular functions such as interleukin-18 binding and receptor activity (Chen2023Prognostic).

The IL18-IL18RAP axis is essential for the activation of downstream signaling pathways, including NF-kB and MAPK, which are crucial for inflammatory responses (Zehra2019IL18RAP). IL18RAP's role in enhancing IL18 signaling is also linked to its involvement in immune cell activation and chemokine function activation across various cancers (Chen2023Prognostic). In the context of hypertension, IL18RAP is associated with increased expression in hypertensive monocytes, indicating its role in inflammatory processes related to cardiovascular diseases (Alexander2018Human). These interactions highlight IL18RAP's importance in both immune response and disease pathogenesis.
