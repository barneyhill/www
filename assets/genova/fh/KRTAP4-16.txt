# KRTAP4-16

## Overview
KRTAP4-16 is a gene that encodes the keratin-associated protein 4-16, which is a member of the keratin-associated protein (KAP) family. These proteins are integral components of the hair and nail structure, playing a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of the keratin matrix. The KAP family is characterized by their high cysteine content, which facilitates the formation of disulfide bonds, contributing to the mechanical strength and resilience of keratinized tissues. The keratin-associated protein 4-16 is specifically involved in the complex network of interactions that stabilize the hair shaft, influencing hair texture and quality. Variations in the KRTAP4-16 gene have been studied for their potential impact on hair characteristics and related disorders (Smith2021KAP).
