# DEFB129

## Overview
DEFB129 is a gene that encodes the protein defensin beta 129, which is part of the defensin family of antimicrobial peptides. These peptides play a crucial role in the innate immune system by providing a first line of defense against a wide range of pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Defensin beta 129 is categorized as an antimicrobial peptide and is involved in disrupting the integrity of microbial cell membranes, thereby exerting its antimicrobial effects. The expression and regulation of DEFB129 can be influenced by various factors, including microbial exposure and inflammatory signals, highlighting its importance in host defense mechanisms (Qiu2020aarFDC).
