# OR5H1

## Overview
The OR5H1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 5 subfamily H member 1, which is part of the olfactory receptor family, a group of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) responsible for detecting odorants. These receptors are characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is typical of many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors. The OR5H1 protein plays a role in the olfactory system by contributing to the perception of smell through the detection and transduction of odorant signals. While primarily associated with olfactory function, recent studies have suggested that OR5H1 may also have implications in gestational health, particularly in the context of preeclampsia, highlighting its potential as a predictive marker for this condition (Hirata2023Exploring).

## Clinical Significance
The olfactory receptor gene OR5H1 has been studied for its potential role in predicting preeclampsia, a pregnancy-related condition characterized by high blood pressure and potential damage to other organ systems. Research indicates that low expression levels of OR5H1 are associated with an increased risk of developing preeclampsia. This suggests that OR5H1 could serve as a predictive marker for early-onset preeclampsia, with a reported area under the curve (AUC) of 0.847, sensitivity of 0.83, and specificity of 0.75, indicating a statistically significant association (Hirata2023Exploring).

The study also highlights the broader context of olfactory receptors in gestational health, noting that a significant number of these receptors are downregulated in both gestational hypothyroidism and preeclampsia. This downregulation may be linked to compensatory mechanisms against increased blood pressure and hypoxia, which are factors in preeclampsia (Hirata2023Exploring). While the specific clinical significance of OR5H1 mutations is not directly addressed, its expression levels appear to be a crucial factor in the context of preeclampsia risk.
