# EPS8L3

## Overview
EPS8L3 is a gene that encodes the EPS8-like 3 protein, which is part of the EPS8 family known for its involvement in cellular signaling pathways. The EPS8-like 3 protein is implicated in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics, which is crucial for cell shape and motility. This protein is categorized as an adaptor protein, playing a significant role in signal transduction processes. EPS8L3 has been studied for its involvement in various cancers, where it is often found to be upregulated, suggesting its potential role as an oncogene. Its expression levels have been linked to cancer progression and patient prognosis, making it a subject of interest for cancer research and a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Li2019Upregulation; ZENG2018Overexpression; Pan2023Evaluation).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
EPS8L3 has been implicated in various cancers, particularly liver cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In liver cancer, EPS8L3 is significantly upregulated, correlating with higher tumor grades and increased patient mortality. High expression levels of EPS8L3 are associated with shorter survival times, making it a potential prognostic biomarker. The gene's upregulation is linked to enhanced cell proliferation and migration, likely through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, suggesting its role as an oncogene in liver cancer development (Li2019Upregulation).

In HCC, EPS8L3 is overexpressed in cancerous tissues compared to normal liver tissues. This overexpression promotes cell proliferation by inhibiting the transcriptional activity of FOXO1, a tumor suppressor, and activating the AKT signaling pathway. Silencing EPS8L3 in HCC cell lines reduces proliferation, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (ZENG2018Overexpression).

EPS8L3 is also involved in stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), where its high expression is linked to poor prognosis and reduced CD8+ T cell infiltration, suggesting a role in immune evasion and tumor aggressiveness (Pan2023Evaluation).
