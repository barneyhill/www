# CORO6

## Overview
CORO6 is a gene that encodes the protein coronin 6, a member of the coronin family characterized by its seven-bladed β-propeller structure formed by WD40 repeats. Coronin 6 is primarily involved in the regulation of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clustering at the neuromuscular junction, where it plays a critical role in anchoring these receptors to the actin cytoskeleton, thereby ensuring effective neuromuscular transmission (Chen2014Coronin). The protein's structure includes a conserved C-terminal extension and a coiled-coil domain, which are essential for its actin-binding activity and interaction with AChRs (Chen2014Coronin). Beyond its role in muscle tissue, coronin 6 has been implicated in cancer progression, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma, where it influences the Wnt signaling pathway (Zhang2021Coronin; Wang2021CORO6). The evolutionary conservation of coronin 6 across species underscores its biological significance (Chen2014Coronin).

## Structure
Coronin 6 (CORO6) is a member of the coronin family, characterized by its seven-bladed β-propeller structure formed by WD40 repeats. Specifically, Coronin 6 contains five canonical WD40 repeats and two hidden atypical repeats, contributing to its β-propeller configuration (Chen2014Coronin). The protein also features a conserved C-terminal extension and a coiled-coil domain at the end of its cytoplasmic tail, which are crucial for its actin-binding activity (Chen2014Coronin). The N-terminal β-propeller domain and the C-terminal coiled-coil domain are essential for the protein's interaction with actin, and mutations in these regions can disrupt its function (Chen2014Coronin).

Coronin 6 is involved in the regulation of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clustering at the neuromuscular junction, where it forms a complex with AChRs and actin, anchoring the receptors to the cytoskeleton (Chen2014Coronin). The protein's actin-binding capability is critical for maintaining the structure of synaptic AChR clusters, as evidenced by the fragmentation of these clusters upon Coronin 6 knockdown (Chen2014Coronin). The molecular structure of Coronin 6 is highly conserved across various species, indicating its evolutionary significance (Chen2014Coronin).

## Function
Coronin 6 (CORO6) is a protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clustering at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), which is essential for effective neuromuscular transmission. It modulates the anchorage of AChR clusters to the actin cytoskeleton, a process vital for the stability and function of these receptor clusters (Chen2014Coronin). Coronin 6 is involved in both agrin- and laminin-induced AChR clustering, which are critical extracellular signals for the formation and stabilization of AChR clusters (Chen2014Coronin).

The protein forms a complex with AChRs and actin, relying on its C-terminal region and a conserved Arg 29 residue at the N terminus, which are vital for the cytoskeletal anchorage of AChRs (Chen2014Coronin). Coronin 6's actin-binding activity is crucial for the stabilization of the AChR-cytoskeleton linkage, contributing to efficient synaptic transmission at the NMJ (Chen2014Coronin). In muscle fibers, particularly in the tibialis anterior muscle, Coronin 6 is active and critical for the stabilization of AChR clusters (Chen2014Coronin). Its function is linked to muscle differentiation and neural activity regulation, highlighting its importance in maintaining receptor stability and proper NMJ function (Chen2014Coronin).

## Clinical Significance
CORO6 (coronin 6) has been implicated in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a common and aggressive form of liver cancer. Studies have shown that CORO6 mRNA and protein levels are significantly elevated in HCC tissues compared to normal liver tissues. This overexpression is associated with more aggressive tumor characteristics, such as higher histologic grades and advanced TNM stages, and correlates with poor prognosis, including lower survival probabilities in patients (Zhang2021Coronin). 

CORO6 promotes HCC progression by enhancing the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Depletion of CORO6 in HCC cell lines results in decreased cell viability, reduced colony formation, increased apoptosis, and inhibited cell migration and invasion. This is achieved through the upregulation of WNT10B, a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway, which is significantly upregulated in HCC tumor tissues (Zhang2021Coronin). In vivo experiments further demonstrate that CORO6 knockdown leads to reduced tumor growth and downregulation of Wnt target genes such as c-Myc, AXIN2, and CCND1, which are involved in cell cycle regulation and tumorigenesis (Zhang2021Coronin). These findings suggest that CORO6 is a potential target for therapeutic intervention in HCC.

## Interactions
Coronin 6 (CORO6) is involved in several interactions with other proteins, primarily through its role in modulating the actin cytoskeleton. CORO6 interacts with F-actin, which is crucial for its function in acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clustering at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). This interaction is dependent on the coiled-coil domain and a conserved arginine residue (Arg 29) within CORO6, which are essential for its binding to actin and subsequent association with AChR clusters (Chen2014Coronin).

CORO6 forms a complex with AChRs and actin, facilitating the cytoskeletal anchorage of AChRs. This complex is important for maintaining the structural integrity of AChR clusters, particularly in response to agrin and laminin, which induce AChR clustering (Chen2014Coronin). The interaction of CORO6 with actin is independent of agrin treatment, although agrin does promote the recruitment of CORO6 to AChRs, forming an AChR-CORO6-actin complex (Chen2014Coronin).

In addition to its role in muscle tissue, CORO6 has been implicated in cancer progression, where it interacts with components of the Wnt signaling pathway, although specific physical interactions with proteins or nucleic acids in this context are not detailed (Zhang2021Coronin; Wang2021CORO6).
