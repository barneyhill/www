# MNAT1

## Overview
The MNAT1 gene encodes the MAT1 protein, a critical component of the CDK-activating kinase (CAK) complex, which is integral to cell cycle regulation and transcriptional control. MAT1 is categorized as a regulatory protein that stabilizes the interaction between CDK7 and Cyclin H, forming a heterotrimeric complex essential for the activation of CDK7. This activation is crucial for the phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, facilitating transcription initiation and progression (Busso2000Distinct; Peissert2020Structural). The MAT1 protein is characterized by distinct structural domains, including a C-terminal domain and an N-terminal RING finger motif, which are vital for its function within the CAK complex and its interactions with other components of the transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) complex (Busso2000Distinct). Through its role in the CAK complex, MNAT1 is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, transcription, and DNA repair, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Tassan1995In; Eki1998Mapping).

## Structure
The MNAT1 gene encodes the protein MAT1, which is a crucial component of the CDK-activating kinase (CAK) complex. MAT1 is characterized by distinct structural domains that facilitate its interactions within the CAK complex. The protein includes a C-terminal domain that is essential for stimulating CDK7 kinase activity and an N-terminal RING finger motif that plays a significant role in transcription and RNA polymerase II phosphorylation (Busso2000Distinct). The central coiled-coil domain of MAT1 interacts with the XPD and XPB helicases, anchoring the CAK complex to the core of the TFIIH complex (Busso2000Distinct).

MAT1 stabilizes the interaction between CDK7 and Cyclin H, forming a heterotrimeric complex that is essential for the activation of CDK7. This interaction is crucial for the phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, which is necessary for transcription initiation (Peissert2020Structural). The structural integrity of the CAK complex is maintained by MAT1, which interacts with both CDK7 and Cyclin H, contributing to the stability of the complex (Peissert2020Structural). The protein's structure includes motifs commonly involved in protein-protein interactions, such as the RING finger domain and a coiled-coil domain (Busso2000Distinct).

## Function
MNAT1 is a crucial component of the CDK-activating kinase (CAK) complex, which plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation by activating cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) through phosphorylation. This activation is essential for the progression of the cell cycle from the G1 to the S phase, facilitating DNA replication and cell division (Eki1998Mapping). MNAT1 is part of the CDK7-cyclin H-MAT1 complex, which is also involved in transcription and DNA repair as a component of the TFIIH multiprotein complex (Eki1998Mapping).

In healthy human cells, MNAT1 is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the assembly and stabilization of the CDK7-cyclin H complex. This complex exhibits kinase activity towards substrates that mimic the T-loop in CDKs and the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, linking cell cycle progression with transcriptional regulation (Tassan1995In). The presence of MNAT1 in the CAK complex is necessary for the phosphorylation of CDKs, which is crucial for their activation and subsequent cell cycle progression (Tassan1995In). MNAT1's role in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and ensuring proper cell cycle control.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the MNAT1 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions. In particular, an intragenic deletion of MNAT1 has been associated with pectus deformities, such as pectus excavatum and pectus carinatum. This deletion affects the gene's role in connective tissue organization, potentially leading to skeletal anomalies. The study of a family with these deformities revealed that the deletion of MNAT1 is more likely to cause these conditions than other genetic abnormalities present in the family, such as the duplication of the CHRNA7 gene (Heithaus2014An).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, alterations in MNAT1 expression have been linked to Alzheimer's disease. Reduced expression of MNAT1 in cerebral endothelial cells is associated with increased necroptosis and amyloid-beta accumulation, contributing to cerebrovascular pathology and cognitive deficits. Restoring MNAT1 expression in these cells has been shown to protect against endothelial necroptosis and improve cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease models (Zou2020Reduction).

These findings suggest that MNAT1 plays a significant role in both connective tissue disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
MNAT1 is a component of the CDK-activating kinase (CAK) complex, which includes CDK7 and cyclin H (CCNH). This complex is crucial for the activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and is involved in transcription-coupled repair through its association with the transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) complex. MNAT1 interacts with several components of the TFIIH complex, including ERCC2, ERCC3, and GTF2H1, as identified through studies using CDK7, CCNH, and MNAT1 as baits (Huttlin2015The). 

The CAK complex, with MNAT1 as a part, plays a role in phosphorylating the C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase II large subunit, which is essential for transcription initiation and regulation (Varjosalo2013The). The interactions of MNAT1 within the CAK complex and its association with TFIIH highlight its role in both cell cycle regulation and transcriptional control. These interactions are supported by the BioPlex network, which has demonstrated the reliability of these interactions by comparing them with other databases, showing a higher tendency to connect co-localized proteins (Huttlin2015The).
