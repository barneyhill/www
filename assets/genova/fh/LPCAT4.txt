# LPCAT4

## Overview
LPCAT4, or lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 4, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane enzyme involved in lipid metabolism, specifically within the endoplasmic reticulum. The enzyme, also named LPCAT4, plays a pivotal role in the remodeling of phospholipids by catalyzing the conversion of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) to phosphatidylcholine (PC), a process essential for maintaining cellular membrane integrity and fluidity (Shindou2009AcylCoA:Lysophospholipid; Korbecki2024Phospholipid). LPCAT4 is expressed in various tissues, including the uterus, thymus, pancreas, and testes, and is involved in critical cellular functions such as the incorporation of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) into lysophospholipids, which influences cellular signaling pathways (Korbecki2024Phospholipid). The gene's expression and activity have been linked to several physiological and pathological processes, including chondrogenic differentiation and cancer progression, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Tabe2017Lysophosphatidylcholine; Korbecki2024Phospholipid).

## Function
Lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 4 (LPCAT4) is an enzyme localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism by remodeling phospholipids. It catalyzes the conversion of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) to phosphatidylcholine (PC) by transferring an acyl group, with a preference for 18:1-CoA as a substrate (Shindou2009AcylCoA:Lysophospholipid; Tabe2017Lysophosphatidylcholine). This enzymatic activity is essential for maintaining membrane integrity and fluidity, which are vital for normal cellular functions and signaling pathways (Korbecki2024Phospholipid).

LPCAT4 is highly expressed in tissues such as the uterus, thymus, pancreas, and testes, and is involved in the incorporation of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) into lysophospholipids, increasing the DHA to arachidonic acid ratio in glycerophospholipids. This function is important for maintaining the urothelial barrier function and is associated with diacylglycerol (DAG) and protein kinase C (PKC) activation, which are critical for various cellular signaling pathways (Korbecki2024Phospholipid).

In the context of chondrogenic differentiation, LPCAT4 expression increases during the late stages, coinciding with mineralization. It is involved in the transition of chondrocytes into hypertrophic chondrocytes and/or a mineralized phenotype, indicating its role in cartilage formation and maintenance (Tabe2017Lysophosphatidylcholine).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LPCAT4 gene have been associated with various diseases and conditions. In hepatocellular carcinoma, increased expression of LPCAT4 is linked to a worse prognosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. LPCAT4 activates the WNT-β-catenin pathway in cancer cells, leading to increased cholesterol synthesis, which further implicates it in cancer progression (Korbecki2024Phospholipid). Conversely, LPCAT4 expression is decreased in colorectal cancer, indicating a possible anticancer role (Korbecki2024Phospholipid).

In the context of urothelial health, LPCAT4 is crucial for maintaining barrier integrity and cellular bioenergetics. Knockdown of LPCAT4 in human urothelial cells results in a tighter epithelial barrier but impairs wound healing, potentially due to altered lipid signaling dynamics and reduced ATP availability. This suggests that LPCAT4 plays a significant role in diseases where barrier integrity and wound healing are compromised, such as bladder diseases (Mason2022LPCAT4).

In chondrogenic differentiation, LPCAT4 is involved in hypertrophy and mineralization processes. Its knockdown leads to decreased expression of chondrogenic markers and BMPs, indicating its potential relevance in cartilage-related conditions (Tabe2017Lysophosphatidylcholine).
