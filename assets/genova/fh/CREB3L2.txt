# CREB3L2

## Overview
CREB3L2 is a gene that encodes the cAMP responsive element binding protein 3 like 2, a member of the CREB3 family of transcription factors. This protein is characterized as an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in cellular stress responses and protein secretion. Upon ER stress, CREB3L2 undergoes regulated intramembrane proteolysis, allowing its N-terminal fragment to translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription of target genes. This process is crucial for maintaining ER homeostasis and facilitating cellular differentiation and development. CREB3L2 is involved in various physiological processes, including cartilage development and liver fibrosis, and has clinical significance in certain cancers, such as thyroid cancer and low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma, due to its involvement in chromosomal translocations and fusion gene formations (Panagopoulos2010Characterization; Mertens2005Clinicopathologic; Li2023The).

## Structure
The CREB3L2 protein is a member of the CREB3 family of transcription factors and is characterized by several key structural domains. It contains an N-terminal transactivation domain, a basic DNA-binding domain, a leucine zipper region, an α-helical transmembrane hydrophobic region, and a luminal domain (Panagopoulos2010Characterization). The basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain is crucial for DNA binding and dimerization, which are common features in transcription factors (Panagopoulos2006Characterization). 

The full-length CREB3L2 protein is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident transmembrane protein that undergoes regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) in response to ER stress. This process allows the N-terminal fragment, which includes the transactivation domain, DNA-binding domain, and leucine zipper region, to translocate into the nucleus and activate transcription of target genes (Panagopoulos2010Characterization). 

CREB3L2 can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing. An alternative transcript generated by an intronic polyadenylation site in intron 4 lacks the DNA-binding domain, transmembrane domain, and C-terminal part, retaining only the N-terminal transactivation domain. This variant is localized in both the nucleus and the ER (Panagopoulos2010Characterization). The protein is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which affect its molecular weight and function (Panagopoulos2006Characterization).

## Function
CREB3L2 is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in regulating protein transport and secretion within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus. It is part of the CREB3 family and functions as a non-classical sensor of ER stress, helping to maintain ER homeostasis by controlling protein folding and secretion processes. Under conditions of ER stress, CREB3L2 undergoes cleavage, releasing a fragment that translocates to the nucleus to activate the transcription of target genes, thereby preventing the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER (Li2023The).

In healthy human cells, CREB3L2 is involved in the differentiation of various cell types, including endometrial stromal cells during decidualization, where it regulates the secretory pathway and Golgi apparatus remodeling. It is also upregulated during the activation of hepatic stellate cells, contributing to liver fibrosis by promoting ER and Golgi expansion, which is indicative of increased protein synthesis and secretion (Tomoishi2017CREB3L2mediated; Li2023The).

CREB3L2 is expressed in proliferating chondrocytes and is involved in cartilage development by promoting the secretion of type II collagen and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein. It acts as a signaling hub, integrating various signals to oversee protein secretion and transport, highlighting its role in cellular differentiation and development (Li2023The).

## Clinical Significance
The CREB3L2 gene is clinically significant due to its involvement in various cancers, particularly thyroid cancer and low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS). In thyroid cancer, a fusion mutation involving CREB3L2 and PPARγ, resulting from the chromosomal translocation t(3;7)(p25;q34), has been identified in less than 3% of thyroid follicular carcinomas. This fusion protein promotes cell proliferation by inhibiting transcription from the EVX1 CRE and suppressing thyroglobulin expression, contributing to thyroid cancer pathogenesis (Lui2008CREB3L2PPARγ).

In LGFMS, the CREB3L2 gene is involved in a recurrent balanced translocation t(7;16)(q32-34;p11), leading to the formation of a FUS/CREB3L2 fusion gene. This fusion is present in 96% of LGFMS cases and is crucial for tumor development. The FUS/CREB3L2 fusion gene is a specific marker for LGFMS and plays a significant role in its diagnosis (Mertens2005Clinicopathologic; Bartuma2010Fusion).

Additionally, CREB3L2 is targeted by miR-92b-3p in liver fibrosis, where its suppression activates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, promoting fibrosis progression (Huang2021MicroRNA92b3p).

## Interactions
CREB3L2, a transcription factor, is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It is known to bind directly to cAMP responsive elements (CRE) in DNA, which is essential for regulating the transcription of target genes such as ATF5 in malignant glioma cells (Sheng2010A). This binding is part of a survival pathway that includes interactions with upstream activators like FRS2 and PAK1, which are involved in the RAS/MAPK signaling cascade (Sheng2010A).

CREB3L2 also interacts with the transcription factor XBP1 in pituitary cells, where both factors regulate translation and secretory capacities. CREB3L2 targets genes involved in translation, while XBP1 is more involved in ER biogenesis (Khetchoumian2019Pituitary). This interaction highlights their complementary roles in enhancing cellular functions related to protein synthesis and secretion (Khetchoumian2019Pituitary).

In the context of nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced differentiation, CREB3L2 modulates the levels of Rab5 GTPase, a protein involved in membrane trafficking, suggesting a regulatory interaction that affects neuronal differentiation (Sampieri2021CREB3L2). These interactions underscore CREB3L2's role in diverse cellular pathways.
