# PARP10

## Overview
PARP10 is a gene that encodes the protein poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase family member 10, which is a member of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family. This protein is primarily involved in mono-ADP-ribosylation, a type of post-translational modification that plays a significant role in regulating various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, DNA repair, and cellular stress responses. PARP10 is characterized by its catalytic domain, which is homologous to other PARP enzymes, and it is involved in interactions with several proteins, such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and the mitotic kinase Aurora-A, highlighting its role in DNA damage tolerance and mitotic progression (Di2022PARP10; Yu2005PARP10). The protein's activity is modulated by phosphorylation and its interactions with other cellular proteins, which are crucial for its function in maintaining cellular homeostasis and integrity (Chou2006CDKdependent). Additionally, PARP10 has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer, where it may serve as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Schleicher2018PARP10).

## Structure
PARP10 is a protein with a molecular weight of approximately 150 kDa, encoded by a cDNA of roughly 3550 base pairs (Yu2005PARP10). Its molecular structure includes several distinct domains: an RNA recognition motif (RRM) near the N-terminus (amino acids 11-85), a Gly-rich domain (amino acids 281-399), a Glu-rich region (amino acids 588-697), and a catalytic domain homologous to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes (Yu2005PARP10). The C-terminal domain is responsible for its PARP activity, with specific amino acids like Lys916 being crucial for its catalytic function (Yu2005PARP10). 

PARP10 also contains two ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIM) within the C-terminal half (amino acids 650-667 and 673-690) (Yu2005PARP10). Despite lacking an obvious nuclear localization signal, PARP10 shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus, a process influenced by a Leu-rich nuclear export sequence (NES) (Yu2005PARP10). 

The protein's structure is modeled to share features with other PARP domains, despite low sequence identity, supporting its enzymatic function (Yu2005PARP10). PARP10's catalytic domain is involved in mono-ADP-ribosylation, a post-translational modification (Morgan2018Rational).

## Function
PARP10 is a member of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase family, primarily involved in mono-ADP-ribosylation, a post-translational modification of proteins. It plays a crucial role in regulating cell cycle progression and cell viability. PARP10 is phosphorylated by the CDK2-cyclin E complex, particularly during the late G1 to S phase of the cell cycle, which is essential for its enzymatic activity. This phosphorylation enhances its poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation activity, linking it to cell cycle regulation and DNA repair processes (Chou2006CDKdependent).

In healthy human cells, PARP10 is involved in ribosomal RNA synthesis and is a stable component of the RNA polymerase I transcription module. It is enriched in the nucleolus during interphase and mitosis, suggesting its involvement in ribosome biogenesis (Chou2006CDKdependent). PARP10 also interacts with the c-Myc protein, inhibiting cell transformation and proliferation in certain contexts, indicating a role in chromatin regulation and gene expression (Yu2005PARP10).

PARP10 is also linked to mitochondrial function, where its depletion increases mitochondrial oxidative capacity and reduces oxidative stress, suggesting a role in cellular energy metabolism and stress responses (Márton2018PARP10). These functions highlight PARP10's importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and integrity.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PARP10 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer and developmental disorders. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PARP10 interacts with PLK1, where it mediates mono-ADP-ribosylation of PLK1, suppressing its kinase activity and thereby inhibiting HCC progression. An inverse correlation between PARP10 and PLK1 expression is observed in HCC, with low PARP10 levels associated with poor survival outcomes (Tian2020PLK1NFκB). 

PARP10 is also implicated in cellular proliferation and tumorigenesis. It is often amplified in various cancers, promoting cell growth and alleviating replication stress, which is crucial for cancer cell survival. Loss of PARP10 results in reduced proliferation and increased sensitivity to replication stress, suggesting its role as an oncogene (Schleicher2018PARP10).

In a clinical context, a mutation in PARP10 has been linked to severe developmental delay and DNA repair defects. This mutation results in the absence of PARP10 protein, leading to increased DNA damage sensitivity and impaired repair mechanisms, highlighting its importance in maintaining genomic integrity (Shahrour2016PARP10). 

These findings suggest that PARP10 could serve as a biomarker for predicting therapeutic responses and as a potential target for cancer treatment (Nicolae2014The).

## Interactions
PARP10, also known as ARTD10, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in DNA damage tolerance and cell cycle regulation. One significant interaction is with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), where PARP10 binds through a PCNA-interacting peptide (PIP) box. This interaction is enhanced by PCNA ubiquitination, which is essential for efficient binding and recruitment of translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerases, facilitating DNA repair processes (Nicolae2014The).

PARP10 also interacts with the NS1 protein of the H5N1 avian influenza virus. This interaction causes PARP10 to migrate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, affecting virus replication and cell cycle regulation. NS1 can inhibit PARP10 expression, leading to cell cycle arrest in the G2-M phase, which is associated with increased virus replication (Yu2011The).

Additionally, PARP10 mediates the mono-ADP-ribosylation of the mitotic kinase Aurora-A, which is crucial for Aurora-A's activation and recruitment to centrosomes during the G2/M transition of the cell cycle. This post-translational modification is necessary for proper mitotic progression (Di2022PARP10).
