# TSPAN4

## Overview
TSPAN4 is a gene that encodes the protein tetraspanin 4, a member of the tetraspanin family, which is characterized by its role as a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes. Tetraspanin 4 is integral to the formation and stabilization of migrasomes, cellular structures that facilitate cell migration and communication. The protein's ability to interact with cholesterol and cluster within the plasma membrane is crucial for maintaining membrane structure and dynamics, impacting cell adhesion, migration, and signal transduction. These functions are essential for physiological processes such as organ morphogenesis and mitochondrial quality control. TSPAN4's interactions with other proteins, including the histamine H4 receptor, further underscore its involvement in immune response modulation and potential therapeutic targeting in diseases where these pathways are dysregulated (Ma2021Identification; Dharan2023Tetraspanin; Dharan2022Tetraspanin).

## Function
Tetraspanin 4 (TSPAN4) is a protein involved in the formation and stabilization of migrasomes, which are cellular structures that play a role in cell migration and communication. Migrasomes form through a two-stage process where initial membrane swellings occur on retraction fibers, followed by the recruitment of TSPAN4 to these swellings. TSPAN4 is crucial for the stabilization and maturation of these swellings into migrasomes, as it helps maintain their structure and prevents them from dissipating (Dharan2023Tetraspanin; Dharan2022Tetraspanin).

TSPAN4's role in migrasome formation is facilitated by its ability to cluster and interact with cholesterol, which reduces its intrinsic curvature and allows it to stabilize membrane structures. This interaction is essential for the structural dynamics of cell membranes, particularly in processes involving membrane tension and curvature (Dharan2023Tetraspanin; Dharan2022Tetraspanin).

In healthy human cells, TSPAN4 is primarily active in the plasma membrane, where it contributes to cell adhesion, migration, and signal transduction. These processes are vital for various physiological functions, including organ morphogenesis and the disposal of damaged mitochondria (Dharan2023Tetraspanin).

## Clinical Significance
TSPAN4 (tetraspanin 4) has been implicated in various cancers, including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and gastric cancer, due to alterations in its expression levels. In GBM, high TSPAN4 expression is associated with poor prognosis and is considered an independent prognostic factor. It is linked to increased tumor cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, suggesting its role as an oncogene. Knockdown experiments in GBM cell lines have shown that reducing TSPAN4 expression can inhibit these malignant behaviors, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Zheng2023TSPAN4; Li2023Tetraspanins).

In gastric cancer, TSPAN4 is significantly overexpressed, with more than a five-fold increase in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. This overexpression is associated with decreased survival rates, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker. Functional assays have demonstrated that downregulation of TSPAN4 leads to decreased proliferation of gastric cancer cells and delayed tumor growth in vivo (Qi2018Tetraspanin).

TSPAN4 is also involved in the tumor immune microenvironment, influencing immune cell infiltration and interactions with immune checkpoint molecules, which may affect immunotherapy outcomes in cancers like GBM (Zheng2023TSPAN4; Li2023Tetraspanins).

## Interactions
Tetraspanin 4 (TSPAN4) is involved in various protein interactions that contribute to its role in cellular processes. TSPAN4 has been identified as a novel interactor with the histamine H4 receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor involved in immune response and inflammation (Ma2021Identification). This interaction suggests a potential role for TSPAN4 in modulating histamine receptor functions.

TSPAN4 is also crucial in the formation and stabilization of migrasomes, cellular structures that form during cell migration. It facilitates the maturation of migrasomes by stabilizing membrane swellings, a process that involves the recruitment of TSPAN4 to these swellings, enhancing their growth and stability (Dharan2023Tetraspanin). TSPAN4's role in migrasome formation is linked to its ability to self-organize into clusters or domains, which can migrate to areas of the membrane with compatible curvature, often in association with cholesterol (Dharan2023Tetraspanin).

These interactions highlight TSPAN4's involvement in cellular signaling and structural processes, indicating its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in diseases where these pathways are dysregulated.
