# ASB2

## Overview
The ASB2 gene encodes the ankyrin repeat and SOCS box containing 2 protein, which is a crucial component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This protein is characterized by its ankyrin repeat domains and a C-terminal SOCS box, which facilitate its role in targeting specific proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. ASB2 is involved in various cellular processes, including muscle differentiation, hematopoiesis, and the regulation of the Notch signaling pathway. The gene is expressed in multiple tissues, such as skeletal muscle, heart, and bone marrow, indicating its significant role in both muscle and hematopoietic cell differentiation. ASB2 has two splice variants, ASB2α and ASB2β, which contribute to its diverse functional roles. The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as the Elongin BC complex and filamin proteins, underscore its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating cytoskeletal organization (Heuzé2005ASB2; Anasa2018Multifaceted; Bello2009The).

## Structure
The ASB2 protein is characterized by the presence of ankyrin (ANK) repeat domains and a C-terminal SOCS box domain. The ANK repeat domain consists of 30-34 amino acid residues forming two antiparallel α-helices and a β-hairpin, creating an elongated structure with a hydrophobic core and a solvent-accessible surface, which facilitates specific, high-affinity molecular interactions (Anasa2018Multifaceted). ASB2 is the longest protein in the ASB family, containing 12 ANK repeats that influence its interaction with substrates (Anasa2018Multifaceted).

The SOCS box domain in ASB2 is involved in protein-protein interactions and is part of the ECS complex, interacting with components like Elongin B/C and Cullin (Heuzé2005ASB2; Anasa2018Multifaceted). This domain is crucial for the assembly of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which targets proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation (Heuzé2005ASB2; Nie2010Notchinduced). The SOCS box contains a BC-box motif that allows ASB2 to interact with the Elongin BC complex, which is essential for the stability and function of the protein (Heuzé2005ASB2).

ASB2 has two functional splice variants, ASB2α and ASB2β, with ASB2β containing an additional ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM) in the N-terminal region (Anasa2018Multifaceted). These variants contribute to different functional roles in cellular differentiation processes (Anasa2018Multifaceted).

## Function
The ASB2 gene encodes a protein that functions as part of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which is crucial for targeting specific proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. This process is essential for regulating protein turnover and maintaining cellular homeostasis. ASB2 is involved in various cellular processes, including muscle differentiation and hematopoiesis. The ASB2β isoform specifically targets filamin B (FLNb) for degradation, a process vital for muscle differentiation, as it affects myoblast fusion and muscle protein expression (Bello2009The).

In cardiomyocytes, ASB2β targets desmin for degradation, preventing its accumulation, which could impair the ubiquitination proteasome system in conditions like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Anasa2018Multifaceted). ASB2 also plays a role in the regulation of the Notch signaling pathway by ubiquitinating its targets, such as E2A and Janus kinase 2, through a non-canonical E3 ligase complex (Anasa2018Multifaceted).

ASB2 is expressed in various tissues, including skeletal muscle, heart, and bone marrow, indicating its involvement in both muscle and hematopoietic cell differentiation (Guibal2002ASB2; Bello2009The). Its expression is induced during myogenic differentiation and is crucial for the regulation of integrin-dependent functions and cytoskeletal reorganization (Bello2009The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the ASB2 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cardiac and hematological conditions. In cardiac development, the loss of ASB2 impairs cardiomyocyte differentiation, leading to congenital heart defects such as double outlet right ventricle (DORV) and ventricular septal defects (VSDs). This is due to the dysregulation of the actin cytoskeleton and the TGFb/Smad signaling pathway, which are crucial for proper heart morphogenesis (Yamak2020Loss). The ASB2 gene is also involved in the degradation of Filamin A, and its absence results in abnormal expression of this protein, contributing to heart defects (Métais2018Asb2α–Filamin; Yamak2020Loss).

In hematological contexts, ASB2 plays a role in the degradation of the MLL protein during hematopoietic differentiation. Alterations in ASB2 expression can affect MLL protein levels and the expression of MLL target genes, impacting leukemia progression. ASB2 expression reduces the proliferation of MLL fusion-transformed cells, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in MLL-related leukemias (Wang2012ECSASB2). These findings highlight the importance of ASB2 in both cardiac and hematological health, with potential implications for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
The ASB2 protein is involved in various protein-protein interactions, primarily through its ankyrin repeats and SOCS box. ASB2 interacts with the Elongin BC complex via a BC box motif, which is crucial for forming an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex with Cullin 5 and Rbx1. This complex facilitates polyubiquitination, targeting proteins for degradation (Heuzé2005ASB2). ASB2 also interacts with Skp2, which is essential for forming a dimeric E3 ligase complex involving Cul1 and Cul5, enhancing ubiquitination efficiency (Nie2010Notchinduced).

ASB2α, a variant of ASB2, specifically interacts with filamin A (FLNa), regulating integrin-dependent adhesion of hematopoietic cells. The interaction involves the ANK 1 to 10 domains and a motif within the N-terminal region of ASB2α, which binds to the IgFLNa21 domain of FLNa. This binding is mediated by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts, involving residues such as Ser-11, Phe-13, Leu-12, and His-14 of ASB2α (Lamsoul2011Functional). These interactions are critical for ASB2α's role in cytoskeletal organization and cell adhesion.
