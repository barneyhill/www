# LSMEM1

## Overview
Leucine-rich single-pass membrane protein 1 (LSMEM1) is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes. The protein, characterized by its leucine-rich domains, is implicated in the regulation of cellular signaling pathways and membrane dynamics. LSMEM1 has garnered attention due to its differential expression in several diseases, including Parkinson's disease and prostate cancer, suggesting a potential role in disease pathogenesis and progression. Despite its emerging significance, the precise biological functions and mechanisms of LSMEM1 remain to be fully elucidated, necessitating further research to understand its role in health and disease (Hudson2023Parkinson’s; Whittle2024Earlystage; Li2023Identification).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
LSMEM1 has been implicated in several diseases through alterations in its expression levels. In Parkinson's disease (PD), LSMEM1 is differentially expressed in early-stage idiopathic PD, as identified in RNA sequencing studies. Its altered expression may be linked to the disease's development and non-motor symptoms, although the specific clinical significance of these changes remains unclear (Hudson2023Parkinson’s; Whittle2024Earlystage).

In prostate cancer (PCa), LSMEM1 is part of a prognostic model for predicting patient outcomes. High expression levels of LSMEM1 are associated with a worse prognosis, indicating its potential role in drug resistance and disease progression. The gene is included in a set of hub genes that may be targets for reversing resistance to androgen deprivation therapy (Li2023Identification).

LSMEM1 has also been identified as one of the most upregulated differentially expressed genes in Parkinson's disease patients, although the consistency of these findings across studies is challenged by methodological differences (Tng2024Systematic). Despite these associations, the specific mechanisms by which LSMEM1 contributes to these diseases are not fully understood, and further research is needed to elucidate its clinical significance.
