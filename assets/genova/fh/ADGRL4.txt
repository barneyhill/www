# ADGRL4

## Overview
ADGRL4, also known as ELTD1, is a gene that encodes the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor L4, a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR) family. This receptor is characterized by its large extracellular domain, seven-transmembrane domain, and short intracellular domain, which are integral to its function in cellular adhesion and signaling (Favara2019ADGRL4ELTD1). The protein plays a crucial role in angiogenesis, particularly in endothelial and smooth muscle cells, where it facilitates the formation of new blood vessels (Favara2021Elevated). Unlike typical GPCRs, ADGRL4 does not activate canonical signaling pathways, suggesting it may operate through alternative mechanisms (Favara2021Elevated). Its expression is notably high in vascular endothelium across various organs, implicating it in maintaining vascular integrity and function (Musa2016Heart). ADGRL4's involvement in pathological conditions, such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases, highlights its potential as a therapeutic target (Favara2021Elevated).

## Structure
ADGRL4, also known as ELTD1, is a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family characterized by a large extracellular domain (ECD), a seven-transmembrane (7TM) domain, and a short intracellular domain (ICD) (Favara2019ADGRL4ELTD1). The ECD contains epidermal growth factor (EGF) domains, including an EGF Ca2+ binding domain, which are crucial for its adhesion properties (Favara2019ADGRL4ELTD1). The protein's structure is divided into three main compartments: the ECD, the GAIN domain containing the GPCR proteolysis site (GPS), and the 7TM domain (Favara2019ADGRL4ELTD1).

The GAIN domain and GPS motif are highly conserved and play a role in receptor activation (Favara2019ADGRL4ELTD1). The 7TM domain is essential for signal transduction, with specific conserved motifs such as the ionic lock and polar networks that are involved in maintaining the receptor's inactive conformation and facilitating activation (Arimont2019Identification). The protein does not activate canonical GPCR signaling pathways and lacks a PDZ motif, but it can induce the expression of ELMOD1, a GTPase-activating protein involved in angiogenesis (Favara2021Elevated). The exact post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms of ADGRL4 are not detailed in the available context.

## Function
ADGRL4, also known as ELTD1, is an adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR) expressed in endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells, where it plays a significant role in angiogenesis, the process of forming new blood vessels from existing vasculature (Favara2021Elevated). In endothelial cells, ADGRL4 is involved in promoting endothelial sprouting angiogenesis, a critical process for both physiological and tumor angiogenesis (Favara2021Elevated). Despite its role in angiogenesis, ADGRL4 does not activate canonical GPCR signaling pathways, suggesting it may function through alternative, G protein-independent mechanisms (Favara2021Elevated).

ADGRL4 is highly expressed in vascular endothelium across various organs, including the brain, lung, heart, and kidney, indicating its potential role as a pan-vascular gene involved in maintaining the organ-specific phenotype of vascular beds (Musa2016Heart). In the context of heart development, ADGRL4 expression increases with age in rats and is found in cardiomyocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells, suggesting a role in cardiac function and potentially in counteracting myocardial hypertrophy (Musa2016Heart). The specific cellular functions of ADGRL4 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated, but its involvement in endothelial functions and angiogenesis is evident.

## Clinical Significance
The ADGRL4 gene, also known as ELTD1, is implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In cancer, ADGRL4/ELTD1 is upregulated in tumor-associated endothelial cells, promoting angiogenesis and tumor growth. It is particularly associated with glioblastoma, colorectal, ovarian, and renal cancers, where its high expression correlates with improved survival in patients undergoing anti-cancer therapy (Favara2021Elevated; Favara2019ADGRL4ELTD1). In glioblastoma, silencing ADGRL4/ELTD1 has been shown to improve survival, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Favara2021Elevated).

ADGRL4/ELTD1 is also linked to kidney-related diseases. It is upregulated in IgA nephropathy and lupus nephritis, but downregulated in chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (CazorlaVázquez2018Adhesion). In cardiovascular contexts, loss of ELTD1 in mice leads to cardiovascular and renal defects, indicating its role in these systems (Sevastre2021ELTD1—An).

The gene's involvement in endothelial cell metabolism and the Notch signaling pathway further underscores its significance in disease processes, particularly in cancer and vascular disorders (Favara2019ADGRL4ELTD1a).
