# KRT84

## Overview
The KRT84 gene encodes keratin 84, a type II hair keratin protein that plays a critical role in the structural integrity of hair and wool fibers. As a member of the keratin family, keratin 84 is involved in the formation of intermediate filaments, which are essential for the mechanical stability and resilience of hair shafts. This protein is predominantly expressed in the hair cortex, where it contributes to the assembly and organization of keratin filaments, thereby influencing hair texture and strength. Variations in the KRT84 gene have been linked to hair and wool phenotypes, highlighting its importance in hair biology and its potential implications in hair-related disorders (Hintze2020Alopecia; Yu2024Spatiotemporal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the KRT84 gene have been implicated in various hair disorders. In harlequin mutant mice, the presence of an endogenous retrovirus (ERV) associated with the Hq mutation leads to the down-regulation of the KRT84 gene, contributing to alopecia. This mutation results in the suppression of hair cortex-specific genes, including KRT84, which is crucial for hair shaft development. The study suggests that the insertion of the ERV in the Aifm1 gene locus interferes with the transcriptional programs necessary for normal hair growth, leading to hair fragility and loss (Hintze2020Alopecia).

In sheep, variations in the KRT84 gene, particularly single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), have been associated with wool traits such as fiber diameter and curvature. These genetic variations can affect the protein's ability to interact with other keratins, potentially altering the structure and function of wool fibers (Yu2024Spatiotemporal). Although the context does not directly address human diseases caused by KRT84 mutations, the gene's role in hair structure suggests that similar mechanisms could contribute to hair disorders in humans.
