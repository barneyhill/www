# SLC35F2

## Overview
SLC35F2 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 35 member F2, which is part of the solute carrier (SLC) family of transporters. This protein is primarily involved in the transport of nucleotides and other molecules across cellular membranes, playing a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. SLC35F2 is predominantly located in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, where it supports the modification and trafficking of proteins and lipids, essential for various biosynthetic pathways. The protein's function as a transporter is vital for cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation, impacting overall organismal physiology. Additionally, SLC35F2 has been implicated in cancer progression, with its expression levels serving as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets in various cancers, including bladder cancer, papillary thyroid carcinoma, and non-small cell lung carcinoma (He2018Solute; Kotolloshi2021SLC35F2; Li2013Influence).

## Function
SLC35F2 is a member of the solute carrier family, which is involved in the transport of nucleotides and other molecules across cellular membranes. This protein functions as a transporter, primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. SLC35F2 plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating the transport of essential molecules. Its activity is vital for proper cellular function, as it facilitates the movement of nucleotides and other substrates necessary for various cellular processes. The transport activity of SLC35F2 ensures that cells have the necessary components for biosynthetic pathways, which are critical for cell growth and maintenance. By maintaining the balance of these molecules within the cell, SLC35F2 contributes to the overall health and functionality of the organism. The precise regulation of nucleotide transport by SLC35F2 is essential for the synthesis of nucleic acids and other macromolecules, impacting cellular proliferation and differentiation. Its role in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus highlights its importance in the secretory pathway, where it supports the modification and trafficking of proteins and lipids, further underscoring its significance in cellular and organismal physiology.

## Clinical Significance
The SLC35F2 gene has been implicated in the progression of several cancers due to its altered expression and mutations. In bladder cancer, particularly muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), SLC35F2 expression is significantly higher compared to non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and healthy tissues. This overexpression is associated with increased tumor aggressiveness and progression, suggesting that SLC35F2 could serve as a biomarker for distinguishing between MIBC and NMIBC. Mutations in the untranslated regions (UTRs) of SLC35F2 have been identified, which may enhance gene expression and contribute to cancer cell behavior (Kotolloshi2021SLC35F2).

In papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), SLC35F2 is overexpressed and correlates with lymph node metastasis, indicating its role in promoting cancer progression. The gene's expression is linked to the activation of the MAPK signaling pathway, which is crucial for tumor growth and metastasis (He2018Solute).

In non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), SLC35F2 is also overexpressed, and its silencing results in reduced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, highlighting its potential as an oncogene and a target for therapeutic interventions (Li2013Influence). These findings underscore the clinical significance of SLC35F2 in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
SLC35F2 is involved in interactions that influence its localization and function within the cell. One significant interaction is with sorting nexin 2 (SNX2), which plays a role in regulating the plasma membrane localization of SLC35F2. Depletion of SNX2 in cells expressing SLC35F2-GFP results in a marked reduction in GFP intensity, indicating decreased levels of SLC35F2 at the plasma membrane. This reduction is associated with a partial alleviation of the toxic effects of the antitumor compound YM-155, which is imported by SLC35F2, suggesting that SNX2 is crucial for the proper functioning of SLC35F2 in drug uptake (Frommelt2024The).

SLC35F2 is also associated with the plasma membrane and Golgi, as identified through compartment enrichment analysis. The depletion of SNX2 attenuates the SLC35F2-mediated import of YM-155, further highlighting the importance of SNX2 in the functional regulation of SLC35F2 (Frommelt2024The). These interactions suggest that SLC35F2's role in drug transport and cellular localization is modulated by its interaction with other proteins, impacting its ability to mediate the uptake of specific compounds like YM-155.
