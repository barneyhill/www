# PPIE

## Overview
Peptidylprolyl isomerase E (PPIE) is a gene that encodes a multidomain cyclophilin protein, which plays a crucial role in various cellular processes. The protein, also known as Cyp33, is characterized by an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM) and a C-terminal isomerase domain, which facilitate its involvement in nuclear functions such as RNA splicing and chromatin remodeling (Rajiv2018Structural; Thapar2015Roles). As a component of the spliceosome, PPIE interacts with several splicing factors, contributing to the assembly and function of this complex essential for pre-mRNA splicing (Adams2015Nuclear). Additionally, PPIE is implicated in chromatin remodeling through its interaction with the MLL1 histone methyltransferase, influencing histone modifications and gene expression (Thapar2015Roles). The protein's involvement in the XAB2 complex further underscores its role in transcription-coupled DNA repair and RNA binding, highlighting its importance in maintaining genomic stability (Rajiv2018Structural).

## Structure
PPIE, also known as peptidylprolyl isomerase E, is a multidomain cyclophilin protein characterized by an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM) and a C-terminal isomerase domain. The primary structure of PPIE includes these distinct domains, which contribute to its functional versatility (Rajiv2018Structural; Thapar2015Roles). The secondary structure of the isomerase domain features a typical cyclophilin fold, consisting of an eight-stranded β-barrel with two α-helices packed against the β-sheet (Thapar2015Roles). The RRM domain exhibits a typical α/β fold, which is common in RNA-binding proteins (Thapar2015Roles).

The tertiary structure of PPIE is compact and globular, with the isomerase domain structurally characterized at high resolution, including a crystal structure resolved at 1.61 Å (Rajiv2018Structural). PPIE can form quaternary structures through interactions with other proteins, such as its integration into spliceosomal complexes, where it interacts with various splicing factors (Rajiv2018Structural).

Post-translational modifications of PPIE may include phosphorylation and acetylation, contributing to its functional regulation. The presence of splice variant isoforms of PPIE can lead to structural and functional diversity, allowing it to participate in a range of cellular processes (Rajiv2018Structural).

## Function
PPIE, also known as peptidylprolyl isomerase E or Cyp33, is a nuclear cyclophilin involved in several critical cellular processes. It contains an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM) and a C-terminal isomerase domain, which contribute to its multifaceted role in the nucleus (Rajiv2018Structural). PPIE is a component of the spliceosome, where it interacts with various splicing factors, such as SF3B4, SF3B2, and SF3A2, playing a role in the assembly and function of this complex, which is essential for pre-mRNA splicing (Adams2015Nuclear; Rajiv2018Structural).

PPIE also participates in chromatin remodeling by interacting with the PHD3 domain of the MLL1 histone methyltransferase. This interaction affects histone modifications, such as H3K4 methylation and H3 acetylation, leading to the repression of MLL1 target genes (Thapar2015Roles). The proline isomerization activity of PPIE is crucial for inducing conformational changes in MLL1, facilitating the recruitment of histone deacetylases (Thapar2015Roles).

In addition to its role in splicing and chromatin remodeling, PPIE is part of the XAB2 complex, which is involved in transcription-coupled DNA repair and RNA binding, highlighting its importance in maintaining genomic stability and proper gene expression (Rajiv2018Structural).

## Interactions
PPIE, also known as peptidylprolyl isomerase E, is a multidomain cyclophilin that interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing significant roles in chromatin remodeling and RNA splicing. It contains an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM) and a C-terminal isomerase domain, which facilitate its interactions with different molecular partners. PPIE is part of the XAB2 complex involved in transcription-coupled DNA repair and interacts with the PHD3 domain of the histone reader MLL1 through its RRM motif, while its isomerase domain interacts with a proline in MLL1 (Rajiv2018Structural; Thapar2015Roles).

In the spliceosome, PPIE is present in pre-catalytic B complexes and catalytic C complexes, where its RRM and isomerase domains interact with splicing factors such as SF3B4, SF3B2, and SF3A2. The RRM motif also potentially interacts with SYF1 and AQR, while the isomerase domain interacts with AQR and SYF1 in the C* complex (Rajiv2018Structural). PPIE is the only spliceophilin observed to interact directly with pre-mRNA substrates, suggesting a role in regulating splicing (Rajiv2018Structural). Additionally, PPIE binds to poly(A) and poly(U) RNA tracts, enhancing its PPIase activity (Thapar2015Roles).
