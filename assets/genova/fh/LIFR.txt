# LIFR

## Overview
The Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor (LIFR) gene encodes the LIF receptor subunit alpha, a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling pathways. This receptor is integral to the formation of a high-affinity receptor complex with gp130, which is essential for the activation of various signaling cascades, including the JAK/STAT, MAP kinase, and PI3 kinase pathways. These pathways are crucial for regulating cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival. The LIFR protein is characterized by its modular structure, comprising cytokine-binding modules, an immunoglobulin-like domain, and fibronectin type-III domains, which facilitate its interaction with multiple cytokines such as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), and oncostatin M (OSM) (PlunFavreau2003Leukemia; Huyton2007An). Mutations in the LIFR gene are linked to several severe disorders, including Stüve-Wiedemann syndrome and Schwartz-Jampel type 2 syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance (Dagoneau2004Null). Additionally, LIFR functions as a tumor suppressor in certain cancers, such as breast cancer, where its altered expression is associated with tumor progression (Real2019Mutation).

## Structure
The Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor (LIFR) is a complex protein with a modular structure that includes several distinct domains. The extracellular region of LIFR contains two cytokine-binding modules (CBM), separated by an immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domain, followed by three membrane-proximal fibronectin type-III (FNIII) domains (Viswanadhapalli2022Targeting; Huyton2007An). The Ig-like domain is crucial for ligand binding and receptor dimerization, playing a significant role in the interaction with ligands such as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), and oncostatin M (OSM) (Bitard2003Mutations; PlunFavreau2003Leukemia).

The LIFR structure adopts an extended zigzag conformation, with a saddle-shaped protein-protein interacting interface formed by a four-helix bundle from LIF and one sheet and loops from LIFR (Viswanadhapalli2022Targeting). Specific residues in the Ig-like domain, such as Asp 214 and Phe 284, are critical for high-affinity interactions with ligands (PlunFavreau2003Leukemia). The receptor forms a high-affinity signaling complex with gp130, a common receptor subunit, which is essential for initiating downstream signaling pathways (Huyton2007An).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, may occur, although specific details are not provided in the context. The structural integrity and functional signaling of LIFR are highly dependent on the precise arrangement and interaction of its domains (PlunFavreau2003Leukemia).

## Function
The Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor (LIFR) is a crucial component in several cellular signaling pathways, primarily involved in regulating cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival. LIFR functions as a receptor for the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and is part of a receptor complex that includes gp130. This complex is essential for initiating downstream signaling cascades, such as the JAK/STAT, MAP kinase, and PI3 kinase pathways, which are activated upon LIF binding. These pathways play significant roles in cell differentiation, survival, and self-renewal, depending on the cell type (Tajeddin2021Investigation).

LIFR is involved in neuroprotective immunity and is crucial for maintaining a balance between inflammation and neuroprotection. It supports the cholinergic system and influences the blood-brain barrier's ability to allow neuroprotective factors into the central nervous system (Metcalfe2019NEUROPROTECTIVE). In the context of neuronal differentiation, LIFR signaling negatively modulates nerve growth factor-induced neurite outgrowth, affecting neuronal morphology and function (Ng2003Leukemia).

LIFR also plays a role in embryonic development and fertility, acting as a receptor for multiple cytokines, including LIF, OSM, CNTF, and CT-1. Its ability to bind different ligands highlights its multifunctional role in various biological processes (Tajeddin2021Investigation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LIFR gene are associated with several severe conditions. Stüve-Wiedemann syndrome (SWS) and Schwartz-Jampel type 2 syndrome (SJS2) are autosomal recessive disorders linked to null mutations in the LIFR gene. These conditions are characterized by skeletal abnormalities, respiratory distress, feeding difficulties, and hyperthermic episodes, often leading to early lethality. The mutations result in premature termination of translation, affecting the stability of LIFR mRNA transcripts and leading to the absence of the LIFR protein, which impairs the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway (Dagoneau2004Null).

LIFR mutations also impact the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, leading to adrenal insufficiency. Patients with these mutations may exhibit low cortisol levels and inadequate responses to stimulation tests, necessitating hydrocortisone replacement therapy (Guran2014Effects).

In the context of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), LIFR mutations are linked to structural malformations and inflammation-like changes in the urothelium. These mutations can lead to conditions such as hydronephrosis and renal hypodysplasia (Christians2020Inflammationlike).

In breast cancer, LIFR functions as a tumor suppressor. Alterations in its expression, such as downregulation and promoter methylation, are associated with tumor growth and metastasis (Real2019Mutation).

## Interactions
The Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor (LIFR) is involved in several critical protein interactions, primarily forming complexes with other cytokine receptors. LIFR interacts with gp130 to form a high-affinity receptor complex essential for signaling pathways such as JAK/STAT, MAPK, and PI3K/AKT, which are crucial for cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival (ZHANG1997Evidence; Giese2005Dimerization). 

LIFR can form heterodimers with gp130, a process primarily induced by the binding of the Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF). This interaction is characterized by the formation of a heterotrimeric complex with a stoichiometry of 1:1:1, contrasting with the 2:2:2 stoichiometry seen in the interleukin-6 receptor complex (ZHANG1997Evidence). The interaction between LIF and LIFR involves specific residues and loops, with the Ig-like domain of LIFR playing a significant role in binding (Huyton2007An).

LIFR also interacts with other cytokines such as Oncostatin M (OSM), which shares the receptor and exhibits cross-reactivity due to similar binding modes (Du2021Crossreactivity). These interactions are crucial for the receptor's role in mediating various biological processes, including immune response and embryonic development (Giese2005Dimerization).
