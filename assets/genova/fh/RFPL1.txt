# RFPL1

## Overview
The RFPL1 gene encodes the ret finger protein-like 1, a member of the E3 ubiquitin ligase family, which plays a pivotal role in cell-cycle regulation and apoptosis. This protein is characterized by a RING-finger domain, a coiled-coil domain, and a B30-2 domain, which collectively facilitate its function in ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of key cell-cycle proteins such as cyclin B1 and Cdc2. By modulating the G2-M phase transition, RFPL1 influences cell proliferation and has potential implications in tumor suppression and developmental morphogenesis. The gene produces two protein variants due to a polymorphism, and its activity is regulated by phosphorylation, with localization primarily in the cytoplasm during the S and G2 phases. RFPL1's interactions and regulatory mechanisms are shared with other RFPL family members, underscoring its conserved function in cellular processes (Seroussi1999Duplications; Bonnefont2010Primatespecific).

## Structure
The RFPL1 protein is characterized by a tripartite structure comprising a RING-finger domain, a coiled-coil domain, and a B30-2 domain. The RING-finger domain is a zinc-finger motif with a C3HC4 signature, where a histidine residue is replaced by a cysteine, distinguishing it from typical RING domains (Seroussi1999Duplications). The coiled-coil domain, spanning residues 65-93, facilitates protein-protein interactions by forming stable, rod-like structures (Seroussi1999Duplications). The B30-2 domain, spanning residues 90-288, is involved in immune response and cellular processes (Seroussi1999Duplications).

RFPL1 also contains an RFPL-defining motif (RDM) between the RING and B30-2 domains, contributing to a complex zinc-finger structure within the RING/U-Box superfamily (Bonnefont2010Primatespecific). This structure is crucial for the protein's antiproliferative activity, particularly in the degradation of cyclin B1 and Cdc2, which are essential for cell-cycle progression (Bonnefont2010Primatespecific).

The RFPL1 gene produces two protein variants: a short form with 287 amino acids and a long form with 288 amino acids, resulting from a polymorphism that adds an extra amino acid (Seroussi1999Duplications). The protein's activity is regulated by phosphorylation, affecting its role in cell proliferation and apoptosis (Bonnefont2010Primatespecific).

## Function
The RFPL1 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in cell-cycle regulation, particularly by influencing the G2-M phase transition. It achieves this by modulating the levels of cyclin B1 and Cdc2 proteins, which are crucial for cell entry into mitosis. The RFPL1 protein facilitates the ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of these proteins, thereby delaying the entry into mitosis and extending the G2 phase duration (Bonnefont2010Primatespecific). This regulatory mechanism is phosphorylation-dependent, with specific phosphorylation sites at Ser 200 and Ser 287 affecting its activity (Bonnefont2010Primatespecific).

RFPL1 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm during the S and G2 phases, similar to cyclin B1 and Cdc2, and its activity is regulated downstream of Pax6 signaling, with potential influence from the p53 transcription factor (Bonnefont2010Primatespecific). The protein's structure includes a RING-like motif and a B30-2 domain, which are typical of E3 ubiquitin ligases, suggesting its role in protein ubiquitination and degradation (Seroussi1999Duplications; Bonnefont2010Primatespecific). This function is crucial for controlling cell proliferation and may also be involved in triggering apoptosis, contributing to developmental morphogenesis and tumor suppression (Bonnefont2010Primatespecific).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
The RFPL1 gene encodes a protein that is involved in regulating cell-cycle progression through its interactions with cyclin B1 and Cdc2. RFPL1 influences the G2-M phase transition by promoting the ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of these proteins, thereby preventing their accumulation and delaying entry into mitosis (Bonnefont2010Primatespecific). This degradation process is crucial for controlling cell proliferation and is shared by other members of the RFPL gene family, such as RFPL2 and RFPL3, indicating a conserved function across these proteins (Bonnefont2010Primatespecific).

RFPL1 is primarily localized in the cell cytoplasm, similar to cyclin B1 and Cdc2 during the S and G2 phases, suggesting a spatial correlation that facilitates its regulatory role (Bonnefont2010Primatespecific). The protein structure of RFPL1 includes a RING finger domain, which is part of the RING/U-Box superfamily known for E3 ubiquitin protein ligase activity, and a coiled-coil domain that mediates protein-protein interactions (Seroussi1999Duplications; Bonnefont2010Primatespecific). These domains are essential for RFPL1's function in targeting cyclin B1 and Cdc2 for degradation, highlighting its role in cell-cycle control and apoptosis (Bonnefont2010Primatespecific).
