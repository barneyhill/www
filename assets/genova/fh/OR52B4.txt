# OR52B4

## Overview
The OR52B4 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 52 subfamily B member 4, a protein that belongs to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This receptor is characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is essential for its role in signal transduction. While primarily associated with olfactory functions, the OR52B4 protein is also expressed in non-olfactory tissues such as the retina, optic nerve, and choroid, indicating potential roles beyond smell perception (Riaz2016GWAS). The gene has garnered interest for its potential involvement in pharmacogenetic responses, particularly in the context of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) treatment, where specific genetic variations may influence therapeutic outcomes (Riaz2016GWAS). Despite its established structural and functional characteristics, the broader physiological implications of OR52B4 remain an active area of research.

## Structure
The OR52B4 protein is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain (7tm) structure, which is crucial for its function in signal transduction. This domain is highly conserved and shares similarities with the 7tm_4 superfamily domain of olfactory receptors and the 7tm_1 domain of the rhodopsin family of 7 transmembrane receptors (Riaz2016GWAS). The OR52B4 protein consists of 314 amino acids and is located in the plasma membrane of the cell, where it plays a role in olfactory signal transduction (Riaz2016GWAS).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation have been identified in OR52B4, with specific phosphorylation sites at threonine 135 and tyrosine 134, which may influence its activity and stability (Yan2011Identification). The expression of the OR52B4 gene has been detected in human eye tissues, including the retina, optic nerve, and choroid, suggesting a potential role beyond olfaction (Riaz2016GWAS). However, the specific functional implications of these structural features and modifications in the context of olfactory signaling or other physiological processes remain to be fully elucidated.

## Function
The OR52B4 gene encodes a protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, specifically classified as an olfactory receptor. These receptors are characterized by a 7-transmembrane domain structure, which is typical of the rhodopsin family of receptors. The OR52B4 protein consists of 314 amino acids and is located in the plasma membrane of cells (Riaz2016GWAS). In healthy human cells, olfactory receptors like OR52B4 are primarily involved in detecting odor molecules. They initiate a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell by binding specific odorants and activating intracellular signaling cascades. This process contributes to the responses of olfactory sensory neurons (Riaz2016GWAS).

The expression of the OR52B4 gene has been detected in human eye tissues, including the retina, optic nerve, and choroid, although its specific functional role in these tissues is not fully elucidated. Olfactory receptors, in general, have been implicated in various biological pathways, such as blood pressure regulation and cancer, suggesting potential roles beyond olfaction (Riaz2016GWAS). The OR52B4 gene has also been highlighted as a potential pharmacogenetic marker for anti-VEGF treatment response in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (Riaz2016GWAS).

## Clinical Significance
The OR52B4 gene has been implicated in the response to anti-VEGF treatment in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). A study identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs4910623, in the promoter region of OR52B4, which is associated with a worse response to ranibizumab treatment in AMD patients. The presence of the G allele of rs4910623 is linked to poorer visual acuity outcomes at both 3 and 6 months of treatment. This association was validated in a replication cohort of European descent, suggesting a potential genetic predisposition influencing treatment variability among AMD patients (Riaz2016GWAS).

The study suggests that the G allele of rs4910623 may alter regulatory motifs near the OR52B4 gene, potentially affecting its expression. However, the clinical significance of OR52B4 gene mutations or expression changes beyond their impact on treatment response in AMD is not directly addressed (Riaz2016GWAS). The role of OR52B4 in angiogenesis and pharmacogenetic response to AMD treatment is not fully understood, and further research is needed to explore its biological basis and potential implications in cancer treatment following anti-VEGF therapy (Riaz2016GWAS).
