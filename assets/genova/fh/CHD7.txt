# CHD7

## Overview
The CHD7 gene encodes the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7, a member of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding (CHD) protein family, which plays a pivotal role in chromatin remodeling. This protein is characterized by its ability to bind methylated histones and its ATP-dependent helicase activity, which facilitates the restructuring of chromatin to regulate gene expression. CHD7 is particularly significant in enhancer-mediated transcription and ribosomal RNA biogenesis, with its activity being crucial in various developmental processes, including neural crest cell formation. Mutations in the CHD7 gene are primarily associated with CHARGE syndrome, a complex developmental disorder, and have also been implicated in other conditions such as Kallmann syndrome. The protein's interactions with other chromatin remodeling complexes and transcription factors underscore its integral role in transcriptional regulation and developmental transitions (Bouazoune2012Chromatin; Zentner2010Molecular; Janssen2012Mutation).

## Structure
The CHD7 protein is a large chromatin-remodeling enzyme consisting of 2,997 amino acids. It is characterized by several functional domains that contribute to its role in chromatin remodeling. The protein contains tandem N-terminal chromodomains, which are responsible for binding methylated histones, particularly histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) (Zentner2010Molecular; Schnetz2010CHD7). The central region of CHD7 includes a SNF2-like ATPase/helicase domain, which is crucial for its chromatin remodeling activity (Zentner2010Molecular; Janssen2012Mutation). 

CHD7 also features a SANT domain, which is involved in DNA binding, and two C-terminal BRK domains, whose functions remain unclear (Allen2007Solution; Zentner2010Molecular). The BRK domains have a compact ββαβ fold, with the second domain having a C-terminal extension of two additional helices (Allen2007Solution). 

The protein is predicted to localize in the nucleus due to its chromatin-related domains and five consensus nuclear localization signals (Zentner2010Molecular). Mutations in CHD7 are associated with CHARGE syndrome, highlighting the importance of its structural integrity for proper function (Kim2008Mutations). The protein's structure allows it to interact with nucleosomes, holding the histone octamer while translocating DNA, which is essential for its remodeling activity (Lee2020CHD7).

## Function
The CHD7 gene encodes a protein that is a member of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding (CHD) protein family, which plays a crucial role in chromatin remodeling. This process is essential for regulating gene expression by altering chromatin structure to facilitate access to DNA for transcription, replication, and repair (Bouazoune2012Chromatin; Janssen2012Mutation). CHD7 functions as an ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeler, requiring both its N-terminal chromodomains and the SLIDE-SANT region to efficiently couple ATP hydrolysis to nucleosome remodeling (Bouazoune2012Chromatin). 

In healthy human cells, CHD7 is involved in enhancer-mediated transcription, particularly in embryonic stem cells, where it colocalizes with core transcriptional circuitry proteins like Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog (Janssen2012Mutation). It also plays a role in ribosomal RNA (rRNA) biogenesis in the nucleolus, acting as a positive regulator of rRNA synthesis, which is crucial for cell proliferation and protein synthesis (Janssen2012Mutation). CHD7 is active in the nucleoplasm and nucleolus, and its function is tissue-specific, influencing processes such as neural crest cell formation and differentiation (Janssen2012Mutation). Mutations in CHD7 can impair its function, leading to developmental disorders such as CHARGE syndrome (Bouazoune2012Chromatin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CHD7 gene are primarily associated with CHARGE syndrome, a complex disorder characterized by a specific set of congenital anomalies. These include ocular coloboma, heart defects, choanal atresia, growth and developmental retardation, genital anomalies, and ear anomalies associated with deafness (Bergman2011CHD7; Janssen2012Mutation). CHARGE syndrome is typically caused by de novo mutations in CHD7, with nonsense and frameshift mutations being the most common (Janssen2012Mutation). The syndrome exhibits broad clinical variability, and there is no clear genotype-phenotype correlation (Zentner2010Molecular).

CHD7 mutations have also been identified in patients with Kallmann syndrome, which shares features with CHARGE syndrome, such as hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and anosmia (Jongmans2008CHD7; Janssen2012Mutation). Some patients with Kallmann syndrome exhibit additional CHARGE features, suggesting a clinical overlap between the two conditions (Jongmans2008CHD7).

In rare cases, CHD7 mutations have been implicated in other conditions with clinical overlap with CHARGE syndrome, such as Omenn-like syndrome and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (Zentner2010Molecular). These findings suggest that CHD7 mutations might contribute to a broader range of phenotypes than previously recognized.

## Interactions
CHD7, a chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. CHD7 interacts with CHD8, another member of the CHD family, forming a complex that may have functions similar to the Drosophila gene kismet. This interaction has been confirmed through yeast two-hybrid assays, co-immunoprecipitation, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays, indicating a robust physical interaction between the two proteins (Batsukh2010CHD8; Batsukh2024Novel).

CHD7 also associates with components of the BAF and PBAF complexes, which are part of the SWI/SNF family of chromatin remodeling complexes. These interactions suggest a role in transcriptional regulation and developmental transitions (Batsukh2024Novel; Batsukh2012Identification). In murine embryonic stem cells, CHD7 colocalizes with transcription factors such as Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, and p300 at enhancer elements, indicating its involvement in enhancer-promoter interactions (Batsukh2024Novel).

FAM124B has been identified as a novel interaction partner of both CHD7 and CHD8, potentially playing a role in the pathogenesis of CHARGE syndrome and other neurodevelopmental disorders (Batsukh2024Novel; Batsukh2012Identification).
