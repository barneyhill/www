# TTC21A

## Overview
TTC21A is a gene that encodes the protein tetratricopeptide repeat domain 21A, which is integral to ciliary function and intraflagellar transport. The protein is characterized by tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions necessary for the assembly and maintenance of cilia, particularly in the context of the intraflagellar transport complex A (Liu2019Biallelic; Wang2019Genetic). These cilia are essential for various cellular signaling pathways, including the Hedgehog signaling pathway, which plays a critical role in cell differentiation and tissue development (Wang2020Genetic). Mutations in TTC21A are associated with several clinical conditions, notably affecting male fertility through conditions such as asthenoteratospermia, characterized by reduced sperm motility and abnormal morphology (Liu2019Biallelic). The gene's involvement in ciliopathies further underscores its significance in maintaining proper ciliary function and its broader implications in human health (Liu2019Biallelic).

## Structure
TTC21A encodes a protein characterized by tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which are crucial for its function in intraflagellar transport (IFT) and ciliary function. These TPR domains are involved in protein-protein interactions and typically form a helical structure that facilitates the assembly of multi-protein complexes (Liu2019Biallelic). The presence of these domains suggests a role in the structural integrity and function of cilia, as they are often involved in the formation and maintenance of flagella, which are essential for sperm motility (Liu2019Biallelic).

The TTC21A protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which could influence its function or interactions with other proteins. Splice variants of TTC21A can result in different isoforms, potentially altering the protein's function or localization within the cell (Liu2019Biallelic). These structural features and modifications underscore the protein's role in ciliary transport and development, as well as its involvement in conditions like asthenoteratospermia, where mutations lead to defects in sperm morphology and motility (Liu2019Biallelic).

## Function
TTC21A, also known as tetratricopeptide repeat domain 21A, encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in ciliary function, particularly in the assembly and maintenance of primary cilia. These cilia are essential for various cellular signaling pathways, including the Hedgehog signaling pathway, which is important for cell differentiation and tissue development (Wang2019Genetic; Wang2020Genetic). TTC21A is a component of the intraflagellar transport complex A, which is vital for the proper functioning of cilia (Lin2022High).

In healthy cells, TTC21A is involved in maintaining the structure and function of cilia, contributing to processes such as protein trafficking and cilia disassembly. It is active in the ciliary axoneme, ensuring the correct assembly and maintenance of these structures, which are critical for organ development and function (Wang2019Genetic). The protein's role in ciliary dynamics is highlighted by its involvement in the retrograde transport of intraflagellar transport proteins and the regulation of ciliary entry of membrane-associated proteins (Wang2019Genetic). These functions underscore TTC21A's importance in cellular signaling and developmental processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TTC21A gene, also known as tetratricopeptide repeat domain 21A, are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting male fertility. Bi-allelic mutations in TTC21A lead to asthenoteratospermia, a condition characterized by reduced sperm motility and abnormal sperm morphology, which can result in male infertility (Liu2019Biallelic). In both humans and mice, these mutations cause significant fertility issues, with affected individuals exhibiting sperm with structural defects such as short, coiled flagella and tailless spermatozoa (Liu2019Biallelic). Transmission electron microscopy has revealed multiple structural abnormalities in sperm, including issues with the axonemal structure, such as missing central-pair microtubules and absent dynein arms (Liu2019Biallelic).

In humans, TTC21A mutations have been identified in individuals with multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagella (MMAF), a condition that follows an autosomal-recessive inheritance pattern (Liu2019Biallelic). These mutations are rare or absent in general population datasets, underscoring their pathogenic role (Liu2019Biallelic). TTC21A is also linked to ciliopathies, a group of disorders caused by defects in cilia structure or function, and its mutations are associated with conditions like nephronophthisis and Jeune syndrome, affecting kidney and skeletal systems, respectively (Liu2019Biallelic).

## Interactions
TTC21A, also known as IFT139A, is involved in intraflagellar transport (IFT) and plays a crucial role in ciliary function. It is associated with the IFT-A complex, which is essential for the retrograde transport of proteins within cilia. TTC21A interacts with several IFT components, including IFT140, IFT20, and IFT52, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. These interactions are vital for ciliary transport and development, highlighting TTC21A's role in maintaining proper ciliary function (Liu2019Biallelica).

The protein contains tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which are important for its function in ciliary processes. These domains facilitate interactions with other proteins involved in ciliary assembly and maintenance. Mutations in TTC21A can lead to structural defects in sperm flagella, contributing to conditions such as asthenoteratospermia, characterized by reduced sperm motility and abnormal morphology (Liu2019Biallelica).

TTC21A's interactions with IFT components underscore its role in the intraflagellar transport system, which is crucial for the assembly and function of cilia. These interactions are essential for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying ciliary-related disorders and male infertility (Liu2019Biallelica).
