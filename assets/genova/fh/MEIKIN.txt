# MEIKIN

## Overview
MEIKIN is a gene that encodes the meiosis-specific kinetochore protein known as the meiotic kinetochore factor. This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of chromosome segregation during meiosis, a specialized type of cell division that results in the formation of gametes. MEIKIN is essential for the mono-orientation of sister kinetochores and the protection of centromeric cohesion during meiosis I, processes that are critical for accurate chromosome segregation (Kim2014Meikin). The protein interacts with key components of the kinetochore, including CENP-C and Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), to facilitate its functions (Kim2014Meikin). MEIKIN's activity is modulated by cleavage through the protease Separase during anaphase I, ensuring proper chromosome alignment in meiosis II (Maier2020Separase). The absence of MEIKIN leads to defects in meiotic chromosome segregation and infertility, highlighting its critical role in reproductive biology (Kim2014Meikin).

## Function
MEIKIN is a meiosis-specific kinetochore protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of meiotic chromosome segregation. It is involved in the mono-orientation of sister kinetochores and the protection of centromeric cohesion during meiosis I, processes essential for accurate chromosome segregation (Kim2014Meikin). MEIKIN achieves these functions by stabilizing the localization of the cohesin protector shugoshin and facilitating the enrichment of Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) at kinetochores, which is necessary for kinetochore function during meiosis I (Kim2014Meikin).

MEIKIN interacts with the conserved kinetochore protein CENP-C, and its C-terminal sequences are crucial for its localization to the kinetochores (Maier2020Separase; Kim2014Meikin). During anaphase I, MEIKIN is cleaved by the protease Separase, which modulates its activity to ensure proper chromosome alignment during meiosis II (Maier2020Separase). This cleavage results in a C-terminal fragment that remains associated with kinetochores, retaining the ability to interact with CENP-C and recruit PLK1, thereby maintaining its role in meiosis II (Maier2020Separase). The proper function of MEIKIN is essential for fertility, as its absence leads to defects in meiotic chromosome segregation and infertility in mammals (Kim2014Meikin).

## Interactions
MEIKIN, a meiosis-specific kinetochore protein, interacts with several key proteins to facilitate proper chromosome segregation during meiosis. It forms a complex with CENP-C, a conserved kinetochore protein, which is crucial for its localization to kinetochores during meiosis I (Kim2014Meikin). MEIKIN also interacts with Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), a critical kinase in cell cycle regulation. This interaction is phospho-dependent, requiring phosphorylation at multiple sites on MEIKIN. The C-terminal fragment of MEIKIN retains the ability to bind PLK1 even after cleavage by Separase, highlighting the importance of this region for its interaction with PLK1 (Maier2020Separase). MEIKIN recruits PLK1 to kinetochores, which is essential for kinetochore function during meiosis I, including mono-orientation and centromeric cohesion protection (Kim2014Meikin). MEIKIN also stabilizes shugoshin 2 (SGO2) at centromeres, contributing to the protection of centromeric cohesion (Kim2014Meikin). These interactions underscore MEIKIN's role as a central regulator of kinetochore function, ensuring accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis (Pontremoli2021Kinetochore).
