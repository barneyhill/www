antigen-specific activation of T cells, and is found on the surface of thymocytes, T lymphocytes, monocytes, granulocytes, and some B lymphocytes. It contains a mucin-like extracellular domain, a transmembrane region and a carboxy-terminal intracellular region. The extracellular domain has a high proportion of serine and threonine residues, allowing extensive O-glycosylation, and has one potential N-glycosylation site, while the carboxy-terminal region has potential phosphorylation sites that may mediate transduction of activation signals. Different glycoforms of this protein have been described. In stimulated immune cells, proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular domain occurs in some cell types, releasing a soluble extracellular fragment. Defects in expression of this gene are associated with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.
