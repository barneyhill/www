# HENMT1

## Overview
HENMT1 (HEN methyltransferase 1) is a gene that encodes a methyltransferase enzyme involved in the post-transcriptional modification of small RNAs, particularly PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). The HENMT1 protein is characterized by its methyltransferase (MTase) domain, which is essential for its enzymatic function, and it plays a crucial role in the 2'-O-methylation of piRNAs. This modification is vital for the stability and maturation of piRNAs, which are key in maintaining genomic integrity by silencing transposable elements, especially in germ cells (Kaldis2023Is; Kaldis2024Molecular). The protein's activity is primarily cytoplasmic, where it interacts with nucleic acids and proteins to facilitate RNA methylation. HENMT1's function is critical in processes such as spermatogenesis and has implications in male fertility and cancer, where its dysregulation can lead to conditions like oligoasthenoteratospermia and influence cancer prognosis (Lim2015HENMT1; Zheng2022Exploring).

## Structure
The HENMT1 protein is composed of 393 amino acids and includes a confirmed methyltransferase (MTase) domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Kaldis2023Is). This domain alone is not catalytically active; full activity is achieved when combined with the FKPP motif at the N-terminus, spanning residues 26-263 (Kaldis2023Is). The MTase region of HENMT1 has been crystallized, revealing a structure that includes a well-conserved seven-stranded β-sheet and an additional β-sheet, sandwiched between helices (Kaldis2024Molecular). 

The protein lacks a double-stranded RNA binding motif, which explains its preference for small single-stranded RNAs (Kaldis2023Is). The C-terminal domain (CTD), spanning residues 263-393, lacks homology in the primary sequence, suggesting variability across species and a potential role in substrate recognition or protein interaction (Kaldis2024Molecular; Kaldis2023Is). 

HENMT1's MTase region has been crystallized with SAH and SAM, but it lacks the cofactor Mg2+, preferring Mn2+ for its activity (Kaldis2024Molecular). The protein's architecture suggests that the CTD and N-terminus may cooperatively recognize and bind substrates or interact with other proteins for localization (Kaldis2024Molecular).

## Function
HENMT1 (HEN methyltransferase 1) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the 2'-O-methylation of PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) in healthy human cells. This methylation is essential for the maturation and stability of piRNAs, protecting them from degradation and ensuring their proper function in maintaining genomic integrity (Kaldis2024Molecular). HENMT1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it facilitates the processing and regulation of small RNAs, particularly piRNAs, which are crucial for silencing transposable elements in germ cells (Kaldis2024Molecular).

In the context of spermatogenesis, HENMT1 is involved in the early phases and is essential for the repression of transposons in adult male germ cells. The enzyme's activity is characterized by a catalytic mechanism involving the deprotonation of the 2'-OH group and a methyl transfer from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to the 2'-O position, facilitated by specific residues such as His800 and Asp859 (Kaldis2024Molecular). The loss of HENMT1 function can lead to piRNA instability and male sterility, highlighting its importance in maintaining the integrity of the germline (Kaldis2024Molecular). HENMT1 also plays a role in the methylation of the 3'-terminal 2'-Ome of miR-21-5p, which is significant in human non-small cell lung cancer (Kaldis2024Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and dysregulation of the HENMT1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in male fertility and cancer. In male fertility, mutations in HENMT1 lead to conditions resembling oligoasthenoteratospermia (OAT) in humans, characterized by low sperm count, poor motility, and abnormal morphology. This is due to the gene's role in piRNA stability, which is crucial for transposon repression and proper spermatogenesis. The loss of HENMT1 function results in piRNA instability, leading to the derepression of transposable elements and genome instability, ultimately causing male infertility (Lim2015HENMT1).

In cancer, HENMT1 is implicated in various types, including cervical squamous cell carcinoma and other malignancies. Its expression is often dysregulated, with studies showing upregulation in cervical cancer, where it is associated with a better prognosis, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Zheng2022Exploring). Additionally, HENMT1 is noted for prevalent copy number variation deletions across multiple cancer types, indicating its role in cancer progression and potential as a therapeutic target (Wang2023Human; Begik2020Integrative).

## Interactions
HENMT1 interacts with nucleic acids and proteins to facilitate the methylation of small RNAs, particularly piRNAs. It is involved in the 2'-O-methylation of the 3'-terminal of piRNAs, which is crucial for their stability and protection from degradation. HENMT1 binds to the 3'-terminal nucleotide of piRNAs, coordinating with Mg2+ through conserved residues, which aids in the methylation process (Kaldis2023Is). The enzyme interacts with the ribose hydroxyl groups and phosphate groups of nucleic acids, without direct contact with nucleobases, indicating a specific binding mode that supports its methyltransferase activity (Kaldis2024Molecular).

HENMT1 also interacts with Argonaute proteins, such as AGO2, enhancing the stability and binding affinity of methylated miRNAs like miR-21-5p. This interaction is crucial for the miRNA's resistance to degradation by exoribonucleases (Liang20203′Terminal). In the context of piRNA pathways, HENMT1's role in methylation is essential for maintaining the integrity and function of piRNAs, which are involved in transposon repression and gene regulation during spermatogenesis (Lim2015HENMT1). These interactions highlight HENMT1's critical role in RNA stability and gene expression regulation.
