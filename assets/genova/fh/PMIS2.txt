# PMIS2

## Overview
PMIS2 is a gene that encodes the PMIS2 transmembrane protein, which is specifically expressed in sperm cells. This protein is integral to sperm function and fertility, primarily through its role in the localization of the ADAM3 protein on the sperm surface. The PMIS2 transmembrane protein is crucial for sperm migration through the uterotubal junction (UTJ) and successful fertilization, as it facilitates the proper positioning of ADAM3, a key player in these processes. Although direct interactions between PMIS2 and other proteins such as ADAM3 have not been conclusively demonstrated, PMIS2 is thought to interact with testis-specific chaperones like CLGN and CALR3, which are necessary for its proper folding and function. The evolutionary dynamics of PMIS2 suggest it may have species-specific roles in fertilization, highlighting its potential importance in reproductive biology (Cormier2024SMA20PMIS2; Yamaguchi2012Mice).

## Interactions
PMIS2 is a sperm-specific transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in sperm function and fertility. It is involved in the proper localization of the ADAM3 protein on the sperm surface, which is essential for sperm migration through the uterotubal junction (UTJ) and successful fertilization. The absence of PMIS2 results in the lack of ADAM3 on spermatozoa, indicating a potential interaction or dependency between these proteins, although direct interactions or heterodimer formation have not been demonstrated (Yamaguchi2012Mice).

PMIS2 may interact with testis-specific chaperones such as CLGN and CALR3, which are thought to assist in its folding. However, no direct interaction was detected through immunoprecipitation experiments. The absence of PMIS2 in spermatozoa from mice with disrupted CLGN or CALR3 genes suggests that these chaperones are necessary for the proper folding and function of PMIS2 (Yamaguchi2012Mice).

In addition to its role in sperm migration, PMIS2 is speculated to interact with the uterotubal junction epithelium, potentially influencing sperm-UTJ interactions and sperm-zona binding (Yamaguchi2012Mice). The protein's rapid evolution and species-specific variations suggest it may have diverse roles in fertilization processes across different species (Cormier2024SMA20PMIS2).
