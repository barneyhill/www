# ANKRD13B

## Overview
ANKRD13B is a gene that encodes the ankyrin repeat domain 13B protein, which is part of the ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein family. This protein is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeats and ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs), which are essential for its role in cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway. ANKRD13B functions as a molecular scaffold, facilitating the interaction between ubiquitinated EGFR and RING finger protein 11 (RNF11), a RING E3 ligase, thereby playing a critical role in the early stages of EGFR internalization and sorting within the endosome-to-lysosome pathway (Mattioni2020Ring). This process is vital for the regulation of receptor signaling and degradation, highlighting the importance of ANKRD13B in cellular signaling pathways (Mattioni2020Ring).

## Function
ANKRD13B is a member of the ANKRD13 protein family, which plays a significant role in the regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway. This protein family is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeats and ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs), which are crucial for their function in cellular processes. ANKRD13B, along with ANKRD13A and ANKRD13D, interacts with ubiquitinated EGFR on the plasma membrane following ligand binding. This interaction facilitates the rapid ubiquitin-dependent internalization of the activated receptor and its sorting from the cell surface to the endosome-to-lysosome route, a process essential in the early phases of EGFR endocytosis (Mattioni2020Ring).

ANKRD13B forms a complex with RING finger protein 11 (RNF11), a RING E3 ligase, which is involved in the early stages of EGFR internalization. Although RNF11 does not directly interact with EGFR, it forms a transient complex with ANKRD13 proteins, acting as molecular scaffolds that link RNF11 to ligand-activated EGFR. This complex peaks shortly after ligand stimulation, indicating its role in the early phase of the endocytic process (Mattioni2020Ring). The interaction between RNF11 and ANKRD13B is modulated by EGF stimulation, enhancing binding efficiency and suggesting a broader role for ANKRD13B in membrane receptor internalization (Mattioni2020Ring).

## Interactions
ANKRD13B, a member of the ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein family, is known to interact with the RING finger protein 11 (RNF11). This interaction is facilitated through ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) present in ANKRD13B, which allow it to bind ubiquitin chains linked to proteins such as the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) after ligand activation (Mattioni2020Ring). ANKRD13B, along with its family members ANKRD13A and ANKRD13D, acts as a molecular scaffold that links RNF11 to activated EGFR, playing a role in the receptor's internalization and sorting within the endosome-to-lysosome pathway (Mattioni2020Ring).

The interaction between ANKRD13B and RNF11 does not require the ubiquitination of RNF11, suggesting a direct binding mechanism through the UIMs (Mattioni2020Ring). This interaction is crucial for the regulation of EGFR ubiquitination and internalization, which is a key step in receptor signaling and degradation (Mattioni2020Ring). While specific details about ANKRD13B's interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed, it is implied that ANKRD13B participates in similar interactions as ANKRD13A due to the presence of UIM motifs (Mattioni2020Ring).
