# DNTTIP2

## Overview
DNTTIP2, or deoxynucleotidyltransferase terminal interacting protein 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation. The protein encoded by DNTTIP2 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it plays a crucial role in DNA repair and replication, contributing to cellular homeostasis and genomic stability. It is particularly significant in the regulation of immune responses, including B cell differentiation and maturation, and has been implicated in various conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema (Rigobello2019Exome). Additionally, DNTTIP2 is associated with metabolic processes, notably in the regulation of serum polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) concentrations, and has been identified as a potential hub gene in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia, indicating its involvement in cell proliferation and apoptosis (Wang2022Exploration; Coltell2020GenomeWide). The diverse roles of DNTTIP2 underscore its importance in both physiological and pathological contexts.

## Structure


## Function
DNTTIP2 (deoxynucleotidyltransferase terminal interacting protein 2) is involved in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation. It interacts with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and may influence gene expression by modifying chromatin structure. DNTTIP2 is active in the nucleus, where it plays a role in DNA repair and replication processes, contributing to cellular homeostasis and genomic stability. The gene is implicated in the regulation of immune responses, as it is involved in B cell differentiation and maturation, and has been shown to have enriched expression in conditions such as COPD and emphysema, suggesting its role in immune response modulation (Rigobello2019Exome).

In addition to its role in immune function, DNTTIP2 has been associated with the regulation of serum polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) concentrations, particularly in the context of sex-specific interactions, indicating its potential involvement in metabolic processes (Coltell2020GenomeWide). The gene has also been identified as a potential hub gene in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia, where it is upregulated, suggesting a role in cell proliferation and apoptosis (Wang2022Exploration). These diverse functions highlight the gene's involvement in critical cellular and physiological processes.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the DNTTIP2 gene have been associated with various diseases. In high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), changes in DNTTIP2 expression levels are significantly linked to disease-free survival, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic marker (Li2021Differential). In pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (pAML), DNTTIP2 is identified as one of the upregulated hub genes, indicating its involvement in the disease's pathogenesis (Wang2022Exploration).

In medulloblastoma, DNTTIP2 is involved in aberrant chromatin interactions due to its presence on circular extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA), contributing to tumor heterogeneity and potentially influencing treatment resistance (Chapman2023Circular). The gene is also implicated in moyamoya disease, where it is significantly upregulated, suggesting a role in the disease's immune response pathways (Kanamori2021Transcriptomewide).

DNTTIP2 has been identified as a susceptibility locus for intracerebral hemorrhage, although the functional relevance of this association remains unclear (Yamada2018Identification). Additionally, hypermethylation of DNTTIP2 has been observed in ovarian carcinoma, which may aid in differentiating cancerous conditions (Erdogan2020Genome‑wide).

## Interactions
DNTTIP2, or deoxynucleotidyltransferase terminal interacting protein 2, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a role in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation. In the context of ribosomal RNA processing, DNTTIP2 has been identified as a significant interactor of the 5′-ETS region, which is involved in early pre-rRNA processing. However, specific details on the physical interactions of DNTTIP2 with other proteins or nucleic acids in this context are not provided (Dodel2023TREX).

In another study, DNTTIP2 was identified as an interactor of the high mobility group A2 (HMGA2) protein using biotin proximity labeling techniques. The interaction was confirmed with 8 peptides in the BioID2 AP/MS experiment and 7 peptides in the miniTurbo AP/MS experiment. The log2 SILAC ratios indicated a significant interaction, suggesting that DNTTIP2 was specifically biotinylated in cells expressing ligase-tagged HMGA2, implying a direct or close interaction. However, the specific nature of this interaction remains unspecified (GaudreauLapierre2023Nuclear).

DNTTIP2 is also highlighted as a regulator of chromatin remodeling involved in B cell differentiation and maturation, with potential implications in the pathogenesis of COPD and emphysema. However, specific physical interactions in this context are not detailed (Rigobello2019Exome).
