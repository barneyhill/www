# GRB10

## Overview
GRB10 is a gene that encodes the growth factor receptor-bound protein 10, an adaptor protein involved in intracellular signaling pathways, particularly those associated with receptor tyrosine kinases. The GRB10 protein is characterized by its multi-domain structure, including a Ras-associating (RA) domain, a pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain, a BPS region, and a Src-homology-2 (SH2) domain, which facilitate its role in signal transduction (Depetris2009Structural). As an adaptor protein, GRB10 primarily functions as a negative regulator of insulin signaling, impacting cellular processes such as growth, metabolism, and differentiation (Kabir2014Grb10). The gene is expressed in various tissues and exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may confer tissue-specific functions (Plasschaert2014Tissuespecific). GRB10's involvement in critical signaling pathways underscores its significance in both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions, including its potential role as a tumor suppressor and its association with metabolic disorders (Mroue2015Monoallelic; Yang2021GRB10).

## Structure
GRB10 is a multi-domain adaptor protein involved in receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. It contains several key domains: a Ras-associating (RA) domain, a pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain, a BPS (between PH and SH2) region, and a Src-homology-2 (SH2) domain. The RA domain adopts a ubiquitin-like fold, while the PH domain is characterized by a seven-stranded anti-parallel β sandwich and a C-terminal α helix. The PH domain also features a unique helical extension that facilitates dimerization (Depetris2009Structural).

GRB10 exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, including hGrb10α, hGrb10β, and hGrb10γ. These isoforms differ in their N-terminal regions and PH domain structures. For instance, hGrb10α lacks part of the PH domain, while hGrb10β has a truncated PH domain (Kabir2014Grb10; García‐Palmero2017The).

The protein can form dimers through its SH2 domain, which is unusual for SH2 domains and involves residues within and flanking the C-terminal α-helix (HOLT2005Grb10). GRB10 is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its interactions and functions (García‐Palmero2017The).

## Function
The GRB10 gene encodes an adaptor protein involved in various intracellular signaling pathways, particularly those associated with receptor tyrosine kinases such as the insulin receptor (IR) and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R). In healthy human cells, GRB10 primarily functions as a negative regulator of insulin signaling. It disrupts the association of insulin receptor substrate (IRS) with the IR, thereby inhibiting insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation and reducing MAPK activation (Kabir2014Grb10). GRB10 also promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of the insulin receptor, affecting its turnover and stability (Kabir2014Grb10).

GRB10 is expressed in various tissues, with higher levels in the pancreas and skeletal muscle, where it modulates insulin and IGF-1 signaling pathways (Kabir2014Grb10). The protein's role in growth regulation is complex, impacting embryonic development, placental efficiency, and muscle growth (Plasschaert2014Tissuespecific). GRB10's involvement in these pathways suggests it plays a critical role in regulating cell growth, metabolism, and differentiation, influencing organismal growth and development by modulating insulin signaling pathways (HOLT2005Grb10). The gene is highly alternatively spliced, resulting in different isoforms that may have tissue-specific roles (Plasschaert2014Tissuespecific).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GRB10 gene have been associated with several diseases and conditions. In type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients, the GRB10 rs1800504 polymorphism is linked to an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Specifically, individuals with the CC+CT genotypes have a higher risk of CHD compared to those with the TT genotype, with an odds ratio of 2.24. This genetic variation is also associated with elevated cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, suggesting that the C allele may be a risk factor for these conditions in T2DM patients (Yang2021GRB10).

GRB10 is also implicated in tumorigenesis. Its loss in Nf1 mutant tumors in mice leads to hyperactivation of the Ras signaling pathway, promoting increased cell proliferation and tumor growth. Restoring GRB10 expression in these tumors reduces proliferation and Ras signaling, indicating its role as a negative regulator of these pathways. The gene's loss is associated with increased oncogenic signaling, suggesting that GRB10 may act as a tumor suppressor in certain contexts (Mroue2015Monoallelic).

In Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS), GRB10 has been investigated for its potential role due to its imprinting and expression patterns. However, no direct link to SRS was established through mutation screening, although its imprinting status might play a role in the syndrome (Hitchins2001Maternal).

## Interactions
GRB10 is an adaptor protein that participates in various protein-protein interactions, primarily through its SH2, PH, and BPS domains. It binds to activated c-kit via its SH2 domain, a crucial interaction for the activation of Akt, a key signaling protein. This interaction is independent of Akt activity and PI3-K pathway activation, suggesting a specific role for GRB10 in Akt signaling (Jahn2002Role).

GRB10 also interacts with the insulin receptor (IR) and the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R). It preferentially associates with the IR over the IGF-1R, a binding facilitated by its SH2 domain. This interaction negatively regulates insulin signaling by disrupting the association of insulin receptor substrates (IRS) with the IR, thereby blocking insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation (Kabir2014Grb10; Laviola1997The).

GRB10 forms complexes with the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4, promoting the ubiquitination and degradation of IGF-1R. This interaction is mediated by the SH2 domain of GRB10 and is crucial for the regulation of IGF-1R stability (Vecchione2003The). GRB10 also interacts with other receptor tyrosine kinases, such as PDGFR, KIT, and FLT3, recruiting signaling proteins and activating pathways like AKT and STAT5 (Kabir2014Grb10).
