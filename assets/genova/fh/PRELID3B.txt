# PRELID3B

## Overview
PRELID3B is a gene that encodes the PRELI domain containing 3B protein, which is a member of the PRELI domain family involved in lipid transfer within mitochondria. The protein plays a critical role in the transport of phosphatidylserine across the mitochondrial intermembrane space, facilitating its conversion to phosphatidylethanolamine in the inner mitochondrial membrane, a process essential for maintaining mitochondrial membrane integrity and function (Miliara2019Structural; Liu2024SLMO2). Structurally, PRELID3B is characterized by a PRELI domain that forms a complex with TRIAP1, enhancing its membrane affinity and stability, which is crucial for its function in lipid transfer (Miliara2019Structural). The protein's role in lipid specificity and transfer is vital for cellular homeostasis and energy production, and its dysregulation has been implicated in various cancers and infectious diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Pirbaluty2022Network; Liu2024SLMO2).

## Structure
The PRELID3B protein is characterized by its PRELI domain, which plays a crucial role in lipid transfer across mitochondrial membranes. The primary structure of PRELID3B includes specific amino acids that are essential for its function, particularly in recognizing lipid head groups and facilitating lipid entry into the binding cavity (Miliara2019Structural). The secondary structure of PRELID3B features a seven β-stranded antiparallel concaved β-sheet packed against three α helices, forming a tunnel-like cavity within the hydrophobic core, capped by the Ω loop (Miliara2019Structural). This structural arrangement is significant for the protein's lipid specificity, as the Ω loop and C-terminal α3 helix exhibit conformational flexibility that influences substrate capture and delivery (Miliara2019Structural).

The tertiary structure of PRELID3B involves the formation of swapped dimers with TRIAP1, where the α3 C-terminal helix is exchanged between two symmetry-related molecules (Miliara2019Structural). This quaternary structure is crucial for the protein's function in lipid transfer. The PRELID3B protein has a more open entrance to its lipid binding cavity compared to other related proteins, which likely contributes to its ability to accommodate larger lipid headgroups like phosphatidylserine (Miliara2019Structural). The structural features of PRELID3B are essential for its role in mitochondrial lipid transfer and specificity.

## Function
The PRELID3B gene encodes a protein that is part of the PRELI domain family, which is involved in lipid transfer within mitochondria. This protein plays a crucial role in the transport of phosphatidylserine (PS) across the mitochondrial intermembrane space, facilitating its conversion to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This process is essential for maintaining mitochondrial membrane integrity and function, which is critical for normal cellular energy production and apoptosis regulation (Miliara2019Structural; Liu2024SLMO2).

PRELID3B forms a complex with TRIAP1, a partner protein that assists in the mitochondrial import and folding of the PRELI domain, enhancing its membrane affinity and stability. This complex is involved in the specific transfer of phospholipids, such as PS, which is vital for the proper morphology and function of mitochondria (Miliara2019Structural). The structural features of PRELID3B, including its hydrophobicity and the presence of an internal lipid binding pocket, are critical for its function in lipid transfer processes (Miliara2019Structural). These activities contribute to the maintenance of mitochondrial function and cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
The PRELID3B gene, also known as SLMO2, has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in lipid transport within mitochondria. Alterations in the expression of PRELID3B are associated with cancer progression, particularly in breast and lung cancers. Studies have shown that PRELID3B is overexpressed in several cancer types, and higher expression levels correlate with poorer prognosis, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Liu2024SLMO2). 

Mutations in PRELID3B are distributed across different tumors and are linked to cancer prognosis, indicating that genetic alterations in this gene may contribute to tumor growth and progression (Liu2024SLMO2). Additionally, methylation analysis has revealed lower methylation levels of PRELID3B in most tumors compared to normal tissues, which may influence its expression and function in cancer (Liu2024SLMO2).

In the context of infectious diseases, PRELID3B has been identified as a significant hub gene in response to avian influenza, suggesting its involvement in the immune response and potential impact on viral infection processes (Pirbaluty2022Network). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PRELID3B in both cancer and infectious diseases.

## Interactions
PRELID3B, a protein encoded by the PRELID3B gene, is known to interact specifically with TRIAP1, forming a complex that plays a crucial role in lipid transfer across the mitochondrial intermembrane space. The PRELID3B-TRIAP1 complex has been structurally characterized, revealing that PRELID3B forms swapped dimers with TRIAP1, involving the exchange of the α3 C-terminal helix between two symmetry-related molecules (Miliara2019Structural). This interaction is significant for the protein's function in phospholipid transfer, particularly phosphatidylserine, which is essential for maintaining mitochondrial integrity (Miliara2019Structural).

The structural analysis of the PRELID3B-TRIAP1 complex, determined at a resolution of 2.9 Å, highlights the intermolecular associations via the swapping of C-terminal α3 helices, suggesting a specific physical interaction between PRELID3B and TRIAP1, as well as potential interactions with other PRELID3B molecules (Miliara2019Structural). These interactions are crucial for the protein's role in lipid specificity and transfer, as the structural features, such as the Ω loop and C-terminal helix, are involved in substrate selection and lipid extraction from the membrane (Miliara2019Structural). There is no evidence from the provided context of interactions between PRELID3B and nucleic acids.
