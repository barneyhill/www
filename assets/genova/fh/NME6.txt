# NME6

## Overview
NME6 is a gene that encodes the protein NME/NM23 nucleoside diphosphate kinase 6, a member of the NME/NDPK family. Unlike other members of this family, the NME6 protein is characterized by its monomeric structure and lack of nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) activity, due to the absence of histidine phosphorylation at its active site (Proust2021NME6; Schlattner2021The). The protein is primarily localized in the mitochondria, where it is associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane and matrix, and it plays a role in mitochondrial translation processes through its interaction with RCC1L, a protein involved in mitoribosome assembly (Proust2021NME6). Despite its lack of classical phosphotransfer activity, NME6 may have regulatory roles in mitochondrial physiology, potentially affecting the assembly or function of respiratory complexes (Proust2021NME6).

## Structure
The NME6 protein, encoded by the human NME6 gene, is a member of the NME/NDPK family and is characterized by its monomeric structure and lack of nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) activity. The primary structure of NME6 includes a sequence of 186 amino acids, with a less abundant isoform consisting of 194 amino acids (Proust2021NME6). The protein's molecular weight is approximately 21.142 kDa, and it has a predicted isoelectric point (pI) of 8.5 (Proust2021NME6).

NME6 does not form oligomers, which is a typical requirement for NDPK activity in other NME proteins, and it remains predominantly monomeric, with some minor dimeric structures observed (Proust2021NME6). The protein lacks the histidine phosphorylation necessary for NDPK activity, which is attributed to structural features such as an insertion of three amino acids within the Kpn loop, potentially affecting substrate stabilization (Proust2021NME6).

NME6 is localized in the mitochondria, specifically associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane and matrix, and interacts with RCC1L, a protein involved in mitochondrial ribosome assembly and translation (Proust2021NME6). The protein's structure includes additional residues in the Kpn loop and at the C-terminal end, which may influence its oligomerization potential (Proust2021NME6).

## Function
NME6 is a member of the NME/NDPK family, known for its role in cellular energy transfer, but it is unique in being phosphotransfer-inactive and monomeric. Unlike other NME proteins, NME6 does not exhibit nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) activity due to the absence of the active site histidine phosphorylation necessary for this function (Proust2021NME6; Schlattner2021The). NME6 is primarily localized within the mitochondria, specifically associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane and matrix (Proust2021NME6).

NME6 interacts with RCC1L, a protein involved in mitoribosome assembly and mitochondrial translation, suggesting a role in regulating mitochondrial translation of essential oxidative phosphorylation subunits (Proust2021NME6). Overexpression of NME6 has been linked to reduced ADP-stimulated mitochondrial respiration and complex III abundance, indicating its involvement in mitochondrial function and possibly affecting the assembly or function of respiratory complexes (Proust2021NME6). Despite its lack of classical phosphotransfer activity, NME6 may have regulatory roles in mitochondrial physiology that are independent of phosphotransfer activity (Proust2021NME6).

## Interactions
NME6, a member of the NME/NDPK family, is characterized by its monomeric nature and lack of phosphotransfer activity. Unlike other NME proteins, NME6 does not form homo-oligomers or interact with Group I NME proteins such as NME1, NME2, NME3, or NME4 (Proust2021NME6). It is primarily localized in the mitochondrial matrix and is partially bound to the mitochondrial inner membrane (Proust2021NME6).

NME6 has a stable interaction with RCC1L, a protein involved in mitoribosome assembly and mitochondrial translation, suggesting a role in mitochondrial translation processes (Proust2021NME6). This interaction is significant as RCC1L is associated with the regulation of mitochondrial ribosome assembly, which is crucial for oxidative phosphorylation (Proust2021NME6).

Despite associations detected among NME6, OPA1, NME4, and RCC1L using proximity ligation assays, NME6 does not form stable complexes with OPA1 (Proust2021NME6). The inability of NME6 to form oligomers and its lack of histidine phosphorylation support its lack of NDPK activity, distinguishing it from other NME proteins (Proust2021NME6).
