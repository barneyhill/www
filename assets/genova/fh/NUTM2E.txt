# NUTM2E

## Overview
NUTM2E is a gene that encodes the protein NUT family member 2E, which is part of a family of proteins involved in chromosomal rearrangements and fusion events. These proteins are often implicated in oncogenic processes, particularly in certain types of sarcomas and other cancers. The NUT family member 2E protein is categorized as a nuclear protein, and its role in cellular processes is still being elucidated. The gene has been associated with various chromosomal translocations, such as the YWHAE-NUTM2E fusion, which is observed in clear cell sarcoma of the kidney and endometrial stromal sarcomas, indicating its potential involvement in tumorigenesis (Gooskens2015The; Brahmi2020Molecular). Additionally, NUTM2E has been linked to neuromuscular and neurodegenerative disorders through GGC repeat expansions, although the functional consequences of these expansions remain to be fully understood (Boivin2021Translation).

## Clinical Significance
The NUTM2E gene is implicated in several chromosomal rearrangements and fusion events associated with certain cancers. In clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK), a rare pediatric renal tumor, the YWHAE-NUTM2E fusion resulting from a t(10;17)(q22;p13) translocation has been identified as a recurrent genetic aberration. This fusion is present in a subset of CCSK cases, although its clinical significance remains unclear due to limited data (Gooskens2015The). The YWHAE-NUTM2E fusion is also noted in endometrial stromal sarcomas (ESS), where it is associated with both high-grade and low-grade subtypes, influencing prognosis and treatment strategies (Brahmi2020Molecular).

In the context of myocardial trabeculation, the NUTM2E gene was identified as one of the loci in a genome-wide association study, although its specific clinical significance in this area was not detailed (McGurk2024Genetic). The gene is also mentioned in relation to neuromuscular and neurodegenerative disorders, where GGC repeat expansions in NUTM2E have been identified, suggesting a potential role in these conditions (Boivin2021Translation). However, the precise impact of NUTM2E mutations or alterations in these diseases requires further investigation.
