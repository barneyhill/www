# OVOL2

## Overview
OVOL2, or ovo like zinc finger 2, is a gene that encodes a zinc finger transcription factor involved in the regulation of epithelial cell identity and differentiation. The protein product of OVOL2 plays a pivotal role in maintaining epithelial characteristics by repressing transcription factors that induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), such as ZEB1 and ZEB2, thereby preserving tissue integrity and function (Kitazawa2016OVOL2; Saxena2020OVOL12:). OVOL2 is crucial in various biological processes, including skin development, hair follicle formation, and corneal epithelial maintenance, by modulating gene expression through its DNA-binding activity (Kitazawa2016OVOL2; Saxena2020OVOL12:). Dysregulation of OVOL2 has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer metastasis and corneal endothelial dystrophies, underscoring its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Davidson2016AutosomalDominant; Ye2016OVOL2).

## Function
OVOL2 is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in maintaining epithelial cell identity and regulating cellular differentiation and proliferation. In keratinocytes, OVOL2 suppresses cell cycling and terminal differentiation by directly repressing the expression of c-Myc and Notch1, which are key regulators of cell proliferation and differentiation (Wells2009Ovol2). This repression helps maintain a balance between proliferation and differentiation, ensuring proper skin homeostasis (Wells2009Ovol2).

OVOL2 is also involved in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), where it acts to inhibit this process by repressing EMT-inducing transcription factors such as ZEB1 and ZEB2. This function is crucial for maintaining epithelial characteristics and preventing the transition to a mesenchymal state, which is important for tissue integrity and function (Kitazawa2016OVOL2; Saxena2020OVOL12:). OVOL2's activity in the nucleus involves binding to DNA to influence gene expression, impacting processes like skin development and hair follicle formation (Saxena2020OVOL12:).

In corneal epithelial cells, OVOL2 maintains the transcriptional program by suppressing EMT, thereby preserving epithelial characteristics and functions (Kitazawa2016OVOL2). This regulatory role is essential for maintaining the epithelial identity of cells across various tissues.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the OVOL2 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in cancer and corneal endothelial dystrophies. In colorectal cancer (CRC), OVOL2 acts as a metastasis suppressor by inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process crucial for cancer metastasis. Reduced expression of OVOL2 is associated with increased tumor invasiveness and poor patient survival, often due to promoter hypermethylation, which silences the gene in late-stage CRC (Ye2016OVOL2). In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), OVOL2 is down-regulated in metastatic cells, and its low expression correlates with poor overall survival. OVOL2 suppresses EMT in NPC, and its reconstitution can reverse mesenchymal phenotypes, reducing metastatic potential (Qi2018OVOL2).

OVOL2 is also linked to autosomal-dominant corneal endothelial dystrophies, such as CHED1 and PPCD1. These conditions are caused by non-coding mutations in the OVOL2 promoter, leading to ectopic expression in the corneal endothelium. This inappropriate expression is associated with corneal abnormalities and secondary glaucoma in affected individuals (Davidson2016AutosomalDominant). These findings highlight the critical role of OVOL2 in maintaining normal cellular functions and its involvement in disease when dysregulated.

## Interactions
OVOL2, a zinc finger transcription factor, participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, influencing multiple cellular processes. It is known to interact with the NF-κB signaling pathway by binding to the P65 protein, a component of the NF-κB complex. This interaction inhibits the recruitment of the coactivator P300 and facilitates the binding of the repressor HDAC1 to P65, thereby repressing P65-mediated transcriptional activation (Zhang2022An). OVOL2 also forms a ternary complex with β-Catenin and TCF4, which recruits HDAC1 to suppress WNT signaling, a pathway crucial for cancer progression (Ye2016OVOL2).

In the context of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), OVOL2 antagonizes TGF-β signaling by reducing Smad4 mRNA expression and increasing Smad7 mRNA expression. It interferes with the binding of Smad4 to DNA and its interaction with Smad2/3, thus inhibiting EMT and cancer metastasis (Wu2017OVOL2). OVOL2 also directly represses the expression of the ZEB1 gene, a key player in cancer metastasis, by binding to its promoter, thereby inducing mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) in osteosarcoma cells (Liu2018Ovol2). These interactions highlight OVOL2's role as a regulatory hub in various signaling pathways.
