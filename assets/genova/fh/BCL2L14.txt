# BCL2L14

## Overview
BCL2L14 is a gene that encodes the BCL-G protein, a member of the BCL-2 family, which is primarily involved in the regulation of apoptosis, or programmed cell death. The BCL-G protein is categorized as a pro-apoptotic factor and exists in multiple isoforms, including BCL-G S and BCL-G L, due to alternative splicing. These isoforms differ in their domain composition, with BCL-G S being a BH3-only protein and BCL-G L containing both BH2 and BH3 domains, which influences their apoptotic activity (Giam2012Bcl2; Hartman2023BCLG:). The gene is subject to regulation by various factors, including p53, and is responsive to apoptotic stimuli such as chemotherapeutic agents (Pickard2014BCL2L14). BCL2L14 has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer, where its expression and genetic alterations can affect tumor progression and treatment response (Lee2020Landscape; Hartman2023BCLG:).

## Structure
The BCL2L14 gene encodes the BCL-G protein, a member of the BCL-2 family, which is involved in apoptosis regulation. The protein exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, including BCL-G S, BCL-G M, and BCL-G L, consisting of 252, 276, and 327 amino acids, respectively (Tzifi2012The; Hartman2023BCLG:). The BCL-G L isoform contains both BH3 and BH2 domains, while the BCL-G S isoform contains only the BH3 domain (Giam2012Bcl2). The BH3 domain is a common feature in BCL-2 family proteins and is crucial for proapoptotic activity, although BCL-G's BH3 domain does not conform to the typical consensus sequence, which may affect its binding affinity (Giam2012Bcl2).

The BCL-G protein is subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation by Ser/Thr maternal embryonic leucine-zipper kinase (MELK) and ubiquitin-like modification by monoclonal non-specific suppressor factor β (MNSFβ), which influence its intracellular signaling pathways (Hartman2023BCLG:). The BCL-G L isoform is diffusely distributed in the cytosol and interacts with BCL-X L, a pro-survival protein, which can block its proapoptotic function (Tzifi2012The). The exact tertiary and quaternary structures of BCL-G are not detailed in the available sources.

## Function
The BCL2L14 gene encodes proteins that are part of the Bcl-2 family, which play a crucial role in regulating apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death. This gene produces two isoforms, Bcl-G L and Bcl-G S, both of which exhibit pro-apoptotic activity. Bcl-G S is a BH3-only protein, while Bcl-G L contains both BH2 and BH3 domains. The pro-apoptotic activity of Bcl-G L is less potent due to negative regulation by the BH2 domain (Pickard2014BCL2L14). These proteins are involved in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway at the mitochondrial level, influencing mitochondrial membrane permeability and cytochrome c release, which are critical steps in apoptosis (Pickard2014BCL2L14).

BCL2L14 is regulated by various factors, including p53, and is upregulated in response to apoptotic stimuli such as chemotherapeutic agents and interferons (Pickard2014BCL2L14). The gene's expression is also influenced by epigenetic modifications, which can affect its role in cellular processes like T cell function and fibrosis (Liu2024DNA). In healthy cells, BCL2L14 contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis and can impact tissue development and immune responses through its role in apoptosis regulation (Pickard2014BCL2L14).

## Clinical Significance
The BCL2L14 gene, also known as BCL-G, is implicated in various diseases through genetic alterations and expression changes. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the BCL2L14-ETV6 gene fusion is associated with increased tumor aggressiveness, cell motility, invasiveness, and resistance to the chemotherapy drug paclitaxel. This fusion is linked to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that contributes to cancer progression and metastasis (Lee2020Landscape; Loo2022Fusion‐associatedcarcinomas; Hartman2023BCLG:).

In hematological malignancies, deletions in chromosome 12 involving BCL2L14 are common in pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Hartman2023BCLG:). Although mutations in BCL2L14 have been identified in AML, they are not classified as pathogenic, and their clinical significance remains unclear (Handschuh2021TranscriptLevel).

Alterations in BCL2L14 expression are observed in several conditions. It is upregulated in CD4+ T cells in systemic lupus erythematosus and in myelodysplasia patients treated with arsenic trioxide and ascorbic acid. Conversely, lower levels of BCL-G are found in prostate cancer and chondrosarcoma cells after iodine-125 irradiation (Hartman2023BCLG:). These expression changes suggest a complex role for BCL2L14 in disease progression and treatment response.

## Interactions
The BCL2L14 gene encodes the Bcl-G protein, which participates in several interactions with other proteins. Bcl-G exists in two isoforms, Bcl-G L and Bcl-G S, both of which exhibit pro-apoptotic activity. Bcl-G S is a BH3-only protein that interacts with JAB1 (c-Jun activation domain binding protein-1). This interaction is crucial for inducing apoptosis in HeLa cells, as JAB1 inhibits the binding of Bcl-2/Bcl-X L by the BH3 domain of Bcl-G S (Pickard2014BCL2L14). Bcl-G L, on the other hand, contains BH2 and BH3 domains and can interact with Bcl-X L, especially when its BH2 domain is deleted, which enhances its apoptotic activity (Pickard2014BCL2L14).

In mouse cells, mBclG is modified by a ubiquitin-like protein, FUBI, which associates with ERKs and inhibits their activation, thereby enhancing apoptosis (Pickard2014BCL2L14). Bcl-G also interacts with components of the Transport particle protein (TRAPP) complex, which is involved in vesicular transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, suggesting a role in vesicle trafficking (Pickard2014BCL2L14; Ramana2021Lung). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of Bcl-G in apoptosis and cellular transport processes.
