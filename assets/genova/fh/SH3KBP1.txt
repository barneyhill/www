# SH3KBP1

## Overview
SH3KBP1 is a gene that encodes the SH3 domain-containing kinase binding protein 1, a multifunctional adaptor protein involved in various cellular processes. This protein is characterized by its three Src homology 3 (SH3) domains, which facilitate interactions with proline-rich sequences and other proteins, playing a crucial role in signal transduction and cytoskeletal organization (Guiraud2020SH3KBP1; Carducci2012The). SH3KBP1 is implicated in the regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling and is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of muscle fibers and T-tubules (Guiraud2020SH3KBP1; Feng2011SH3KBP1‐binding). The gene's expression and function are regulated in a tissue-specific manner, with significant roles in Schwann cells and various cancer types, including glioblastoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (Hodonsky2012SOX10; Song2021SH3KBP1). SH3KBP1's involvement in these pathways underscores its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology (Ye2022Construction).

## Structure
SH3KBP1, also known as CIN85, is a human protein characterized by its complex molecular structure, which includes multiple domains that facilitate its role in cellular processes. The protein contains three Src homology 3 (SH3) domains located at the N-terminus, which are crucial for mediating interactions with proline-rich sequences (PRSs) and forming heterotrimeric complexes with other proteins (Guiraud2020SH3KBP1; Carducci2012The). These SH3 domains are about 60-70 residues long and have a conserved β-barrel fold formed by five or six β-strands arranged in two perpendicular β-sheets (Carducci2012The).

In addition to the SH3 domains, SH3KBP1 includes a central proline-rich region and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain, which targets the protein to endosomal membranes and facilitates interactions with other proteins such as Calnexin (Guiraud2020SH3KBP1). The protein also contains serine-rich domains that contribute to its interaction with the endoplasmic reticulum (Guiraud2020SH3KBP1).

SH3KBP1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which influence its function and interactions. The gene encoding SH3KBP1 can produce splice variant isoforms, contributing to its functional diversity (Hodonsky2012SOX10).

## Function
SH3KBP1, also known as Ruk/CIN85, is a ubiquitously expressed adaptor protein involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, vesicle-mediated transport, and cytoskeleton remodeling. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the architecture and integrity of skeletal myofibers by scaffolding the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and controlling myonuclei motion during muscle fiber formation (Guiraud2020SH3KBP1). SH3KBP1 interacts with Dynamin 2 (DNM2) and is essential for the formation and maintenance of T-tubules, which are critical for muscle function. Depletion of SH3KBP1 leads to disrupted T-tubule architecture and atrophic muscle fibers, highlighting its importance in muscle fiber structure (Guiraud2020SH3KBP1).

In Schwann cells, SH3KBP1 is regulated by the transcription factor SOX10 through an alternative promoter, indicating a tissue-specific function. This regulation is crucial for the expression of specific mRNA isoforms that may play unique roles in these cells (Hodonsky2012SOX10). SH3KBP1 also interacts with CIN85, preventing the degradation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by interrupting the c-Cbl-CIN85 complex, thereby modulating EGFR signaling pathways (Feng2011SH3KBP1‐binding). This interaction suggests a role in fine-tuning EGFR activation and maintaining tissue homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SH3KBP1 gene, also known as CIN85, have been implicated in various cancers. In glioma, particularly glioblastoma, SH3KBP1 expression is positively correlated with tumor grades, indicating that higher levels are associated with more aggressive forms of the disease. Patients with elevated SH3KBP1 expression have a worse prognosis, and the gene is more highly expressed in IDH1 wild-type tumors, suggesting its critical role in glioma progression (Song2021SH3KBP1). SH3KBP1 is also highly expressed in glioma stem cells, where it is co-expressed with markers like SOX2, CD133, and Oct4, indicating its potential as a biomarker for glioma prognosis (Song2021SH3KBP1).

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), SH3KBP1 is upregulated in tumor samples compared to normal tissues, correlating with poor prognosis. It is involved in immune regulation, with a significant positive correlation with immune-related pathways such as the complement system and IL-2-STAT5 signaling (Ye2022Construction).

In upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC), a novel SH3KBP1-CNTNAP5 fusion has been identified, associated with high-grade, muscle-invasive disease and shorter survival, suggesting a role in the aggressive clinical features of this cancer subtype (Moss2017Comprehensive).

## Interactions
SH3KBP1, also known as SHKBP1, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It interacts with CIN85 through its PXXXPR motifs, which are located at the carboxyl terminus of SH3KBP1. This interaction is crucial for modulating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling by preventing the formation of the c-Cbl-CIN85 complex, thereby inhibiting EGFR degradation (Feng2011SH3KBP1‐binding).

SH3KBP1 also interacts with Dynamin 2 (DNM2) in skeletal muscle fibers, where it plays a role in maintaining the architecture of T-tubules. This interaction occurs through the N-terminal SH3 domains of SH3KBP1 (Guiraud2020SH3KBP1). In the context of glioblastoma, SH3KBP1 directly binds to EGFR, acting as an adaptor protein to transduce EGFR signaling, which is crucial for tumorigenesis (Song2021SH3KBP1).

SH3KBP1 is also involved in the interaction network mediated by SH3 domains, where it can form heterotrimeric complexes with the ubiquitin ligase CBL-b, facilitated by a Pro/Arg-rich peptide (Carducci2012The). These interactions highlight SH3KBP1's role as a scaffolding protein in various cellular contexts.
