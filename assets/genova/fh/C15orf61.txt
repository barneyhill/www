# C15orf61

## Overview
C15orf61 is a gene located on chromosome 15 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 15 open reading frame 61. This protein has been associated with the ATP synthase complex, suggesting a potential role in mitochondrial function, although it is not considered a core subunit of the complex. Despite being annotated as a secreted protein, experimental evidence indicates that it is likely a mitochondrial protein, with studies showing its co-migration with ATP synthase subunits (van2023Comparative). The precise biological function of the C15orf61 protein remains to be fully elucidated, as its absence does not significantly impact the enzymatic activities of the oxidative phosphorylation complexes, except for a slight reduction in complex I activity (van2023Comparative). The gene has also been implicated in renal operational tolerance, potentially affecting primary cilia function and immune response (Massart2023An). Further research is necessary to clarify the protein's interactions and its broader implications in cellular and clinical contexts.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
C15orf61 is a gene located on chromosome 15, and its clinical significance is still under investigation. Although C15orf61 is not directly associated with any known renal disease, it has been implicated in renal operational tolerance. A study by Massart et al. highlighted C15orf61 as part of a significant genetic association with renal tolerance, suggesting that variants in this gene may contribute to this condition by affecting primary cilia function, which is crucial for T cell signaling and immune response (Massart2023An).

In a separate study, C15orf61 was identified as one of the orphan genes in a high-throughput phenotypic screen aimed at identifying genetic modifiers of mitochondrial fragmentation in OPA1 mutant fibroblasts. However, the study did not provide specific information about the clinical significance or role of C15orf61 in mitochondrial dynamics (Cretin2021Highthroughput).

Overall, while C15orf61 has been associated with certain genetic and cellular processes, its direct clinical implications remain unclear, and further research is needed to elucidate its role in disease conditions.

## Interactions
C15orf61, also known as chromosome 15 open reading frame 61, is a protein that has been associated with the ATP synthase complex. Although it was not previously reported as a subunit of ATP synthase, recent studies have shown that C15orf61 co-migrates with ATP synthase subunits, suggesting a potential interaction within the mitochondrial context (van2023Comparative). Despite being annotated as a secreted protein, experimental data predict it to be a mitochondrial protein. A knock-out study in human HEK cells indicated that the absence of C15orf61 did not significantly affect the enzymatic activities of the five individual OXPHOS complexes, although there was a slight reduction in the activity of complex I. This suggests that while C15orf61 may interact with ATP synthase subunits, its role might not be critical for the overall function of the complex (van2023Comparative).

The CompaCt method, used to analyze eukaryote complexomes, has been applied to study C15orf61, but specific details on its direct physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids remain unreported (van2023Comparative). Further research is needed to elucidate the precise interactions and functional roles of C15orf61.
