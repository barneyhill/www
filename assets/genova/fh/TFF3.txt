# TFF3

## Overview
Trefoil factor 3 (TFF3) is a gene that encodes the protein trefoil factor 3, a member of the trefoil factor family characterized by a conserved trefoil domain. This protein is primarily involved in maintaining the integrity of epithelial barriers, particularly within the gastrointestinal tract, where it plays a crucial role in mucosal protection and repair. TFF3 is categorized as a secreted protein and is known for its ability to promote cell migration and facilitate wound healing. Beyond its gastrointestinal functions, TFF3 is expressed in various tissues, including the endocrine pancreas and synovial fluid, where it contributes to processes such as pancreatic cell regeneration and joint health. The protein's interactions with receptors like CD147 and LINGO2 are significant for its roles in cancer progression and immune responses. Alterations in TFF3 expression have been linked to several pathological conditions, including various cancers and metabolic disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Yang2022Pathological; Bujak2018Trefoil; Cui2021CD147).

## Structure
TFF3 (trefoil factor 3) is a protein characterized by a single trefoil domain, which consists of a three-loop structure stabilized by three disulfide bonds. This domain is highly conserved among trefoil factor family proteins and is crucial for the protein's stability and function in harsh environments, such as the gastrointestinal tract (Braga2020Structure). The primary structure of TFF3 includes 59 amino acid residues and features seven cysteine residues, with six forming the disulfide bonds that stabilize the trefoil domain and one additional cysteine that can form cross-links with other proteins (Hoffmann2020Trefoil; Albert2010Human).

TFF3 can exist in monomeric, homodimeric, and heterodimeric forms. The homodimeric form, linked via disulfide bonds, is often more biologically active, exhibiting enhanced anti-apoptotic and cell migration-promoting effects (Hoffmann2020Trefoil; Braga2020Structure). TFF3 also forms heterodimers with proteins such as the IgG Fc binding protein (FCGBP), which are disulfide-linked and found in high-molecular-mass forms (Weste2022Different; Albert2010Human). These structural features contribute to TFF3's role in mucosal protection and repair. Unlike some other TFF proteins, TFF3 lacks a consensus sequence for N-glycosylation, and little is known about its post-translational modifications (Braga2020Structure).

## Function
Trefoil factor 3 (TFF3) is a protein primarily involved in maintaining the integrity of the epithelial barrier in the gastrointestinal tract. It plays a crucial role in mucosal protection and repair by promoting cell migration and facilitating wound healing. TFF3 is highly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and is involved in maintaining epithelial barrier integrity, which is essential for protecting the mucosa from damage and aiding in its healing process (Bujak2018Trefoil; Barrera2013Trefoil).

TFF3 is also expressed in the human endocrine pancreas, where it is thought to play roles in pancreatic cell migration, β-cell mitosis, and regeneration. Its expression is regulated by insulin and glucose, with increased glucose concentrations enhancing TFF3 expression, further elevated by insulin treatment (Barrera2013Trefoil). This regulation suggests a potential role for TFF3 in glucose metabolism and pancreatic function.

In addition to its gastrointestinal and pancreatic roles, TFF3 is present in human serum and synovial fluid, where it may contribute to joint health. It is produced by synovial membrane and articular chondrocytes, particularly in conditions like osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, indicating its involvement in inflammatory processes and tissue remodeling (Popp2019Human).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TFF3 gene have been implicated in various cancers and other diseases. In colorectal cancer (CRC), TFF3 is significantly upregulated, promoting tumor progression through enhanced cell migration, invasion, and proliferation. This overexpression is associated with poor overall survival in CRC patients, and the interaction between TFF3 and the CD147 receptor is crucial for these oncogenic processes (Cui2021CD147). In prostate cancer, TFF3 expression, particularly when combined with PTEN loss, is linked to worse prognosis and higher prostate cancer-specific mortality (AbouOuf2019Combined). 

In gastric adenocarcinoma, TFF3 positivity correlates with poorer prognosis and is more frequent in Her-2/neu non-amplified tumors, suggesting its role as an independent prognostic factor (Xu2013Significance). TFF3 is also upregulated in other cancers, such as gastric, lung, thyroid, and breast cancer, where it contributes to proliferation, metastasis, and resistance to apoptosis (Yang2022Pathological). Beyond cancer, TFF3 expression is altered in metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases, with its deficiency linked to impaired glucose tolerance and hearing impairment (LubkaPathak2010Altered; Yang2022Pathological).

## Interactions
TFF3 (trefoil factor 3) is known to participate in several significant protein interactions that influence its biological functions. One of the primary interactions of TFF3 is with the leucine-rich repeat receptor and nogo-interacting protein 2 (LINGO2). TFF3 binds to LINGO2, disrupting inhibitory LINGO2-EGFR complexes, which enhances EGFR signaling. This interaction is crucial for maintaining mucosal barrier integrity and promoting immunity against gastrointestinal helminths (Belle2019TFF3).

TFF3 also interacts with the CD147 receptor, which is essential for its role in colorectal cancer progression. The binding of TFF3 to CD147 induces PTGS2 expression and promotes the production of PGE2, a key inflammatory cytokine. This interaction is significant for cellular regeneration and cancer progression, highlighting the potential of targeting the TFF3-CD147 interaction as a therapeutic strategy (Cui2021CD147).

Additionally, TFF3 forms disulfide-linked heteromers with the mucus-associated FCGBP protein in the human intestine. This interaction is facilitated by disulfide bonds and is significant for the formation of large, mucus-associated TFF3-FCGBP heteromers, which play a role in intestinal restitution (Albert2010Human).
