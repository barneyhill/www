# TIMM22

## Overview
The TIMM22 gene encodes the translocase of inner mitochondrial membrane 22 (TIMM22), a critical component of the mitochondrial protein import machinery. TIMM22 is a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the insertion and assembly of multi-pass transmembrane proteins into the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). This process is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production, as it facilitates the import of metabolite carriers and other translocase components. The TIMM22 complex, which includes additional subunits such as TIM29 and acylglycerol kinase (AGK) in metazoans, operates in conjunction with small TIM chaperone complexes to ensure the proper translocation and integration of precursor proteins. Mutations in the TIMM22 gene have been implicated in various mitochondrial disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (Valpadashi2020Defining; Valpadashi2024Structural; Palmer2021Mitochondrial).

## Structure
The TIMM22 protein is a crucial component of the mitochondrial inner membrane, involved in the translocation and insertion of multi-pass transmembrane proteins. Structurally, TIMM22 is characterized by multiple transmembrane helices, which contribute to its secondary structure and are essential for its function within the mitochondrial membrane (Valpadashi2020Defining; Kumar2020Conserved). 

In humans, TIMM22 contains six cysteine residues that form two intramolecular disulfide bonds, with two free sulfhydryl groups. These disulfide bonds are critical for the protein's integration into the mitochondrial membrane and its structural integrity (Wrobel2016The). The formation of these bonds is a conserved mechanism across species, highlighting their evolutionary significance (Wrobel2016The).

The TIMM22 complex in humans includes additional components such as TIM29 and acyl glycerol kinase (AGK), which are unique to metazoans and contribute to the assembly and function of the complex (Valpadashi2024Structural). The interaction of TIMM22 with these components and small TIM chaperones is crucial for maintaining the structural organization and function of the complex (Valpadashi2020Defining; Valpadashi2024Structural).

## Function
The TIMM22 gene encodes a core component of the TIM22 complex, which is essential for the translocation and insertion of hydrophobic, multi-transmembrane domain proteins into the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) in human cells. This complex is crucial for importing metabolite carriers and other translocase components, such as TIM17 and TIM23, which are vital for mitochondrial function and energy production (Valpadashi2024Structural). The TIM22 complex operates by recognizing precursor substrates with internal targeting signals, initially recognized by the TOM complex on the outer membrane. These precursors are maintained in an import-competent state by small TIM chaperone complexes and are shuttled to the TIM22 complex for insertion into the IMM (Valpadashi2024Structural).

In metazoans, the TIM22 complex includes subunits TIM29 and acylglycerol kinase (AGK), which are essential for the complex's stability and function. TIM29 acts as a docking site for precursor proteins delivered by the TIM9-TIM10 chaperone complex, while AGK serves a dual role as a lipid kinase and a component of the TIM22 complex (Valpadashi2024Structural). The TIM22 complex's function is modulated by its interaction with other mitochondrial complexes, such as TOM40, which is significant for protein import processes (Valpadashi2024Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TIMM22 gene are associated with several mitochondrial disorders, including Combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency 43 (COXPD43) and Sengers syndrome. COXPD43 is characterized by intrauterine growth retardation, feeding difficulties, delayed myelination, and decreased activity of mitochondrial complexes I, II, and IV in muscle tissue. Pathogenic heterozygous mutations in TIMM22, such as nonsense and missense mutations (Y25* and V33L), result in a significant loss of the TIM22 complex in patient fibroblasts, which can be restored through protein complementation (Palmer2021Mitochondrial).

Sengers syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder, is linked to mutations in the TIM22 complex component AGK. This syndrome is characterized by congenital cataracts, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, and lactic acidosis. The severity of Sengers syndrome varies, with severe forms often resulting from homozygous nonsense mutations. Biochemical analyses have shown defects in TIM22-mediated carrier import and impaired lipid metabolism in Sengers syndrome, indicating multiple affected pathways due to AGK mutations (Kang2017Sengers; Palmer2021Mitochondrial).

Alterations in TIMM22 expression or function can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, impacting cellular energy production and contributing to various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and metabolic syndromes (Bogorodskiy2021Role).

## Interactions
The TIMM22 protein is a core component of the TIM22 complex, which is essential for the insertion of multi-transmembrane domain proteins into the inner mitochondrial membrane. TIMM22 interacts with several other proteins to form this complex. It is associated with subunits such as Tim18, Tim54, and SdhA, and in humans, it includes metazoan-specific components like TIM29 and acylglycerol kinase (AGK) (Valpadashi2020Defining). TIMM22 interacts with small TIM chaperone complexes, including TIM9, TIM10, and TIM10B, which assist in maintaining precursor proteins in an import-competent state. These small TIM proteins form hexameric ring structures that dock at the TIM22 complex, interacting with the N-terminal region of TIMM22 and the C-terminal intermembrane space (IMS) region of TIM29 (Valpadashi2020Defining; Valpadashi2024Structural).

AGK, a kinase within the TIM22 complex, also interacts with TIM9 and TIM10, suggesting a potential docking role for its kinase domain, although its kinase activity is not essential for TIM22 function (Valpadashi2020Defining). TIM29, another subunit, may structurally replace yeast Tim18 and interacts with TIMM22, contributing to the complex's stability and function (Valpadashi2020Defining; Valpadashi2024Structural). These interactions are crucial for the import and assembly of carrier proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane.
