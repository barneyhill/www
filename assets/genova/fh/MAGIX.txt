# MAGIX

## Overview
The MAGIX gene encodes the MAGI family member, X-linked protein, which is a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family. These proteins are known for their role in organizing protein complexes at cellular junctions and are involved in various signaling pathways. The MAGIX protein is particularly significant in the context of synaptic function and neuronal signaling, where it contributes to the regulation of synaptic plasticity and maintenance. Its interactions with other proteins are crucial for the modulation of synaptic strength and connectivity, which are essential for cognitive processes. Mutations or dysregulation of the MAGIX gene have been implicated in neurological disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal brain function (Qiu2020aarFDC).
