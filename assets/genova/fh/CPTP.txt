# CPTP

## Overview
The CPTP gene encodes the ceramide-1-phosphate transfer protein, a member of the glycolipid transfer protein (GLTP) superfamily. This protein is integral to the regulation and transport of ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) across cellular membranes, playing a pivotal role in maintaining sphingolipid homeostasis. The ceramide-1-phosphate transfer protein is characterized by its GLTP-fold, which facilitates the non-vesicular transfer of C1P, a process essential for various cellular functions, including programmed cell death, inflammation, and autophagy (Simanshu2013Nonvesicular; Malinina2015Sphingolipid). The protein's ability to interact with specific phosphoinositides, such as PI-(4,5)P2, further underscores its role in cellular signaling and membrane dynamics (Gao2021Ceramide1phosphate). Alterations in CPTP expression have been linked to several diseases, highlighting its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Mishra2020Emerging).

## Structure
The ceramide-1-phosphate transfer protein (CPTP) is characterized by a unique molecular structure that plays a crucial role in its function. CPTP belongs to the glycolipid transfer protein (GLTP) superfamily and features a GLTP-fold, which is a two-layered, all α-helical topology arranged in a 'sandwich' formation (Gao2021Ceramide1phosphate; Malinina2015Sphingolipid). This fold is essential for the protein's ability to transfer ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) between cellular membranes.

The tertiary structure of CPTP includes a hydrophobic pocket that accommodates the sphingosine and acyl chains of C1P. This pocket is lined with nonpolar residues such as phenylalanine, leucine, valine, and isoleucine, which are critical for lipid binding (Simanshu2013Nonvesicular). The protein also features a positively charged surface cavity that anchors the lipid headgroup, with key residues like Lys60, Arg106, and Arg110 forming a hydrogen-bond network crucial for C1P recognition and binding (Malinina2015Sphingolipid; Simanshu2013Nonvesicular).

CPTP's structure is further stabilized by a cation-pi interaction between Arg113 and Tyr149, which enhances the recognition site (Simanshu2013Nonvesicular). The protein's interaction with specific phosphoinositides, such as PI-(4,5)P2, is facilitated by di-Arg motifs, which are crucial for its membrane targeting and function (Gao2021Ceramide1phosphate). The GLTP-fold's adaptability allows CPTP to accommodate various sphingolipid species, highlighting its evolutionary significance in lipid transfer (Malinina2015Sphingolipid).

## Function
Ceramide-1-phosphate transfer protein (CPTP) is a crucial component in the regulation of ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) levels and distribution within human cells. It is part of the glycolipid transfer protein (GLTP) superfamily and is responsible for shuttling C1P between cellular membranes, particularly from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane and other organelles (Rogers2022Ceramide1phosphate; Gao2021Ceramide1phosphate). This transport is essential for maintaining sphingolipid homeostasis, which influences processes such as programmed cell death, inflammation, and autophagy (Mishra2018CPTP:; Simanshu2013Nonvesicular).

CPTP operates by binding to membranes and undergoing conformational changes that facilitate the extraction and insertion of C1P, disrupting hydrophobic lipid-membrane contacts to lower the energy barrier for C1P desorption (Rogers2022Ceramide1phosphate). The protein's activity is enhanced by specific phosphoinositides, such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI-(4,5)P2), which serve as membrane docking sites (Gao2021Ceramide1phosphate).

In healthy cells, CPTP regulates autophagy and inflammasome activation, linking it to innate immunity and inflammatory responses. Its depletion leads to increased autophagic flux and altered C1P distribution, impacting arachidonic acid and pro-inflammatory eicosanoid production (Mishra2018CPTP:). Overall, CPTP plays a vital role in cellular lipid homeostasis and signaling processes, influencing various physiological outcomes.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CPTP gene have significant clinical implications across various diseases. In age-related macular degeneration (AMD), CPTP is notably downregulated, which correlates with increased drusen levels that adversely affect retinal cells (Mishra2020Emerging). In severe acute pancreatitis, reduced CPTP expression is linked to inflammatory damage and changes in tight junction proteins, crucial for maintaining intestinal barrier integrity (Mishra2020Emerging).

In pancreatic cancer, increased CPTP expression is associated with a poorer prognosis. Higher CPTP levels are observed in advanced stages of the disease and are linked to shorter disease-free survival times. Overexpression of CPTP in pancreatic cancer cells promotes proliferation, migration, and invasion, enhancing metastatic potential through the PI4KA/AKT signaling pathway (Zhang2022Human).

CPTP downregulation is also implicated in Chromosome 1p36 deletion syndrome, a genetic disorder characterized by intellectual disability and other symptoms. The deletion often includes the region where CPTP is located, suggesting its potential role in the syndrome's pathophysiology (Mishra2020Emerging). These findings highlight the importance of CPTP in disease mechanisms and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
The ceramide-1-phosphate transfer protein (CPTP) is involved in several interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. CPTP interacts with transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3, which bind to the CPTP promoter region, regulating its expression in pancreatic cancer cells. This interaction is crucial for the transcriptional regulation of CPTP, as demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) (Zhang2022Human).

CPTP also interacts with phosphoinositides, particularly PI-(4,5)P2, through di-Arg motifs located in its structure. These interactions enhance CPTP's lipid transfer activity by facilitating its docking and orientation on membrane surfaces, which is essential for the uptake and release of ceramide-1-phosphate (Gao2021Ceramide1phosphate).

While CPTP's interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed, its role in lipid signaling pathways suggests potential interactions with components involved in these pathways, such as CERK and elements of the eicosanoid biosynthesis pathway (Simanshu2013Nonvesicular). These interactions are critical for CPTP's function in regulating sphingolipid homeostasis and cellular signaling.
