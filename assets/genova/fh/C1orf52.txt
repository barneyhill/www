# C1orf52

## Overview
C1orf52 is a gene located on chromosome 1 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 1 open reading frame 52. This protein is currently categorized as an uncharacterized protein, meaning its specific biological functions and mechanisms remain largely undefined. However, it has been identified as an exosome-derived protein in urine samples, suggesting a potential role in intercellular communication and signaling (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). The protein is also implicated in the formation of the spliceosome complex through its interaction with CXorf56, although the details of these interactions are not fully elucidated (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Research into C1orf52 is ongoing, with a focus on understanding its involvement in cancer-related processes and its broader biological significance.

## Structure


## Function


## Interactions
C1orf52 is known to interact with the protein CXorf56, indicating a binary interaction between these two open reading frame (ORF) proteins (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). This interaction suggests a potential role in the formation of the spliceosome complex, although specific details about the physical interactions of C1orf52 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not provided (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). C1orf52 has been identified as an exosome-derived protein from urine samples, which implies its involvement in intercellular communication and signaling functions (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). However, the precise nature of its interactions, whether stable or transient, remains largely uncharacterized. The study of C1orf52 and its interactions is part of a broader analysis of uncharacterized ORF proteins and their potential roles in cancer-related processes, but specific physical interactions beyond the noted interaction with CXorf56 are not detailed in the available literature (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).
