# TRAF7

## Overview
TRAF7 is a gene that encodes the TNF receptor associated factor 7, a multifunctional protein that belongs to the RING finger family of E3 ubiquitin ligases. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of immune responses, cell survival, and circadian rhythms, through its role in ubiquitination and degradation of target proteins. Unlike other members of the TRAF family, TRAF7 lacks the classical TRAF domain, instead featuring seven WD40 repeats that facilitate protein-protein interactions. The protein encoded by TRAF7 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences key signaling pathways such as NF-kB and MAPK. Mutations in the TRAF7 gene have been implicated in several diseases, including meningiomas and developmental delay-malformation syndromes, highlighting its clinical significance (CastillaVallmanya2020Phenotypic; Masuda2024TRAF7; Zotti2011The).

## Structure
TRAF7 is a unique member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors (TRAF) family, distinguished by its structural composition. Unlike other TRAF proteins, TRAF7 lacks the classical TRAF domain at its C-terminus. Instead, it features seven WD40 repeats, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and contribute to its tertiary structure (Sajjad2019Recognition; Zotti2011The). The N-terminal region of TRAF7 contains a RING finger domain and an adjacent zinc finger domain, which are crucial for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, facilitating ubiquitination events necessary for activating downstream signaling pathways (Sajjad2019Recognition; Zotti2011The).

TRAF7 is involved in various signaling pathways, including the activation of JNK and p38 MAP kinases, and it interacts with MEKK3 through its WD40 repeats (Sajjad2019Recognition). This interaction is distinct from other TRAF family members, which typically use the TRAF domain for such interactions. TRAF7 also participates in unconventional ubiquitination events, such as Lys28-linked ubiquitination of p53 and Lys29-linked ubiquitination of NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO) and p65 (Sajjad2019Recognition).

The gene encoding TRAF7 produces two ubiquitous transcripts, with the longer form encoding a 670-amino acid protein and the shorter form lacking the first 66 amino acids, indicating the presence of splice variant isoforms (Zotti2011The).

## Function
TRAF7 (TNF receptor associated factor 7) is a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, primarily through its role as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. It facilitates the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins, influencing several signaling pathways. TRAF7 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it regulates pathways such as NF-kB and MAPK, which are crucial for immune responses and cell survival (CastillaVallmanya2020Phenotypic; Zotti2011The).

In the context of circadian rhythms, TRAF7 regulates the stability of the D-site binding protein (DBP) by promoting its degradation through K48-linked polyubiquitination. This activity is essential for maintaining robust circadian rhythms in gene expression, as TRAF7's modulation of DBP levels affects the circadian period (Masuda2024TRAF7). TRAF7's interaction with E2 enzymes UBE2G1 and UBE2T is critical for this process, highlighting its role in post-translational regulation (Masuda2024TRAF7).

TRAF7 also plays a role in endothelial cell function by interacting with Robo4 to suppress TNFα-induced hyperpermeability, thereby maintaining endothelial barrier integrity. This interaction is significant in inflammatory conditions, where TRAF7 helps stabilize VE-cadherin at cell junctions (Shirakura2018The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TRAF7 gene are implicated in several diseases, most notably meningiomas, which are brain tumors. Approximately 25% of meningiomas harbor TRAF7 mutations, often co-occurring with mutations in KLF4, AKT1, or PIK3CA, but are mutually exclusive with NF2 and SMO mutations. These mutations are primarily located in the WD40 domain and are associated with WHO grade I meningiomas, typically found at the skull base (Najm2021Loss-of-Function).

Beyond meningiomas, TRAF7 mutations are also found in adenomatoid tumors of the genital tract, intraneural perineuriomas, and a subset of malignant pleural mesothelioma. In these conditions, TRAF7 mutations are also primarily located in the WD40 domain and are mutually exclusive with NF2 mutations (Najm2021Loss-of-Function). TRAF7 mutations in adenomatoid tumors are thought to drive tumorigenesis through aberrant NF-kB pathway activation, as mutant TRAF7 increases phosphorylation of the NF-kB p65 subunit and upregulates L1CAM expression (Goode2018Adenomatoid).

Germline mutations in TRAF7 are linked to a developmental delay-malformation syndrome characterized by cardiac, facial, and digital anomalies, known as TRAF7 syndrome. These mutations are found in the WD40 and coil-coil domains, suggesting a gain-of-function or dominant negative mechanism (CastillaVallmanya2020Phenotypic).

## Interactions
TRAF7, a RING finger family E3 ubiquitin ligase, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with the transcription factor KLF4, promoting its ubiquitination and degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This interaction is significant in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression, as TRAF7-mediated degradation of KLF4 is associated with increased cell motility and metastasis (He2020TRAF7).

TRAF7 also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein P53, facilitating its K48-linked ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. This interaction contributes to tumor progression by reducing apoptosis and promoting cell proliferation, invasion, and migration in HCC cells (Zhang2021TRAF7).

In the context of circadian rhythm regulation, TRAF7 interacts with the D-site binding protein (DBP), mediating its degradation through UBE2G1 and UBE2T-dependent pathways. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the temporal regulation of DBP protein levels, affecting the circadian clock's oscillation (Masuda2024TRAF7).

These interactions highlight TRAF7's role in regulating protein stability and function, impacting various physiological and pathological processes.
