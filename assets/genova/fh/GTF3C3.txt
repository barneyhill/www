# GTF3C3

## Overview
GTF3C3 is a gene that encodes the protein known as general transcription factor IIIC subunit 3, which is a critical component of the transcription machinery in eukaryotic cells. This protein is part of the general transcription factor IIIC (TFIIIC) complex, which is essential for the transcription of small RNA genes, such as tRNA and 5S rRNA, by RNA polymerase III. The GTF3C3 protein plays a pivotal role in the assembly and stabilization of the transcription pre-initiation complex, facilitating the initiation of transcription. It is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it regulates gene expression and supports cellular growth. The activity of GTF3C3 is tightly regulated by cellular factors, including tumor suppressors like p53 and pRb, and can be modulated by viral oncogenes, highlighting its potential involvement in oncogenic processes (Purrello2001Genes).

## Function
GTF3C3 is a component of the general transcription factor IIIC complex, which plays a crucial role in the transcription of small RNA genes, including tRNA and 5S rRNA genes, by RNA polymerase III. This protein is involved in the assembly and stabilization of the transcription pre-initiation complex, which is essential for the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase III. GTF3C3 is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the regulation of gene expression and cellular growth (Purrello2001Genes).

The activity of GTF3C3, as part of the TFIIIC complex, is integral to the synthesis of small cytoplasmic RNAs (scRNAs) and small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), which are important for various cellular processes, including protein synthesis and RNA processing. These processes are critical for maintaining normal cell proliferation and differentiation. The regulation of GTF3C3 and related transcription factors is tightly controlled by specific transcription factors such as p53 and pRb, which can repress their function to prevent the proliferation of cells with potentially harmful mutations (Purrello2001Genes).

The expression of GTF3C3 is also subject to regulation by viral oncogenes, which can enhance its activity, potentially leading to increased transcription by RNA polymerase III and contributing to oncogenesis (Purrello2001Genes).
