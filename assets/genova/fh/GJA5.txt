# GJA5

## Overview
The GJA5 gene encodes the gap junction protein alpha 5, commonly referred to as connexin 40 (Cx40), which is a critical component of gap junction channels in cardiac and vascular tissues. As a transmembrane protein, Cx40 facilitates direct intercellular communication by allowing the passage of ions and small molecules between adjacent cells, thereby playing a vital role in maintaining cardiac conduction and vascular function (Beyer2018Gap). Cx40 is predominantly expressed in the atria of the heart and the ventricular conduction system, where it contributes to the rapid propagation of action potentials, essential for synchronized cardiac contraction (Sun2014Atrial). Additionally, Cx40 is expressed in the juxtaglomerular apparatus of the kidneys, where it is involved in blood pressure regulation through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (Kosovic2020Connexin). Mutations in the GJA5 gene have been linked to cardiac conditions such as atrial fibrillation and congenital heart defects, highlighting its clinical significance in cardiovascular health (SHI2012Prevalence; Guida2012A).

## Structure
The GJA5 gene encodes the gap junction protein alpha 5, also known as connexin 40 (Cx40), which is integral to forming gap junctions in cardiac tissue. The primary structure of Cx40 consists of 358 amino acids (Molica2014Mutations). Connexins, including Cx40, share a common structural topology characterized by an intracellular amino-terminus, four transmembrane domains, two extracellular loops, a cytoplasmic loop, and an intracellular carboxyl-terminus (Sun2014Atrial). The carboxyl-terminus is intrinsically disordered and plays a regulatory role in channel gating and connexin trafficking (Guida2012A).

In terms of quaternary structure, six connexin subunits oligomerize to form a hemichannel, and two hemichannels dock to create a complete gap junction channel (Sun2014Atrial). Cx40 is highly expressed in the atria and parts of the ventricular conduction system, forming high conductance channels essential for rapid action potential propagation (Sun2014Atrial). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can influence the function of connexin channels, affecting their gating and assembly (Guida2012A). These structural features are crucial for the protein's role in cardiac electrical conduction and its involvement in conditions like atrial fibrillation and tetralogy of Fallot (Molica2014Mutations; Guida2012A).

## Function
GJA5 encodes the gap junction protein alpha 5, also known as connexin 40 (Cx40), which is integral to forming gap junction channels that facilitate direct intercellular communication. These channels allow the passage of ions and small molecules between adjacent cells, playing a crucial role in maintaining tissue homeostasis and function (Beyer2018Gap). Cx40 is primarily expressed in the heart and vascular tissues, where it is essential for cardiac conduction and vascular function (Beyer2018Gap).

In the kidneys, Cx40 is expressed in the juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA), a structure involved in regulating blood pressure through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (Kosovic2020Connexin). Cx40's expression in the JGA is crucial for the proper formation and function of this structure during development, and it is associated with the regulation of renin secretion, which influences blood pressure (Kosovic2020Connexin). The protein's role in the JGA highlights its importance in maintaining normal blood pressure and vascular function (Meda2018Gap).

Cx40's function extends to influencing vascular tone and renin secretion, with its deficiency linked to increased renin synthesis and chronic hypertension, underscoring its role in cardiovascular health (Meda2018Gap).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GJA5 gene, which encodes the cardiac gap junction protein connexin 40, have been implicated in several cardiac conditions, most notably atrial fibrillation (AF) and congenital heart diseases such as tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). In atrial fibrillation, mutations in GJA5 can impair gap junction function, leading to disrupted electrical conduction in the heart. These mutations can be inherited or occur as somatic mutations, and they often result in impaired intracellular transport or reduced intercellular electrical coupling of connexin 40, contributing to the erratic electrical activity characteristic of AF (SHI2012Prevalence; Gollob2006Somatic).

In the context of congenital heart diseases, the GJA5 gene has been associated with tetralogy of Fallot. A specific variant, p.Pro265Ser, has been identified in patients with TOF and is linked to disrupted gap junction communication, which affects heart morphology and function. This variant was not found in control groups, suggesting a potential pathogenic role in TOF (Guida2012A). Animal models have supported these findings, demonstrating that GJA5 dysfunction can lead to cardiac malformations and arrhythmogenic substrates (Guida2012A).

## Interactions
GJA5, also known as connexin 40 (Cx40), is involved in forming gap junction channels that facilitate intercellular communication in cardiac tissues. Cx40 interacts with other connexins, such as Cx43, to form heterotypic gap junction channels. These interactions are crucial for cardiac impulse propagation and maintaining proper cardiac function (Jassim2016Engineered). Specific amino acid residues in Cx40, such as those in the extracellular loops E1 and E2, are important for docking interactions with Cx43, which are essential for forming functional heterotypic gap junctions (Jassim2016Engineered).

Mutations in Cx40 can alter its interaction with Cx43, affecting the formation and function of these channels. For instance, the D55N mutation in Cx40 facilitates the formation of heterotypic gap junction plaques with Cx43, which are not observed with the wild-type Cx40 (Jassim2016Engineered). These interactions between Cx40 and Cx43 can influence pH-sensitive gating and single-channel conductance levels, indicating their potential role in forming functional gap junctions in cardiac tissues (Bai2014Atrial). The ability of Cx40 to interact with other connexins and proteins like ZO-1 highlights its role in cardiac conduction and the assembly and function of gap junction channels.
