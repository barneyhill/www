# CLTCL1

## Overview
The CLTCL1 gene encodes the clathrin heavy chain like 1 (CHC22) protein, which is a critical component of the clathrin-coated vesicles involved in intracellular trafficking. CHC22 is particularly significant in the regulation of glucose metabolism, as it mediates the sequestration and release of the glucose transporter GLUT4 in response to insulin, primarily in muscle and adipose tissues. This function is vital for maintaining normal blood glucose levels post-prandially. Genetic variations in CLTCL1, such as the V1316 and M1316 alleles, have been linked to differences in GLUT4 trafficking efficiency and insulin response, reflecting evolutionary adaptations to dietary changes in human history (Fumagalli2018Genetic; Fumagalli2019Genetic).

## Function
The CLTCL1 gene encodes the CHC22 clathrin protein, which plays a crucial role in glucose metabolism by regulating the intracellular trafficking of the glucose transporter GLUT4. In healthy human cells, CHC22 clathrin is involved in the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) that sequester GLUT4 in an intracellular compartment within muscle and adipose tissues. Upon insulin stimulation, GLUT4 is released to the cell surface, facilitating glucose uptake into cells and contributing to the maintenance of blood sugar levels after a meal (Fumagalli2018Genetic; Fumagalli2019Genetic).

CHC22 clathrin is primarily expressed in muscle and adipose tissue, where it regulates the targeting of GLUT4 to its storage compartment, ensuring efficient glucose clearance from the bloodstream. This process is essential for post-prandial blood glucose clearance and is influenced by genetic variations in the CLTCL1 gene, which can affect the efficiency of GLUT4 membrane traffic and insulin response (Fumagalli2018Genetic; Fumagalli2019Genetic).

The gene has undergone evolutionary changes, with two major alleles, V1316 and M1316, differing in their effectiveness at GLUT4 sequestration. These variations are thought to be influenced by dietary changes in human history, impacting CHC22's role in metabolism (Fumagalli2018Genetic; Fumagalli2019Genetic).
