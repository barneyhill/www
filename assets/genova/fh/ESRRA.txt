# ESRRA

## Overview
The ESRRA gene encodes the estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα), a nuclear receptor protein that functions as a transcription factor. ERRα is involved in the regulation of energy metabolism and mitochondrial function, particularly in tissues with high energy demands such as the heart, liver, brown adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle. Unlike classical estrogen receptors, ERRα does not require a specific ligand to activate its transcriptional activity, allowing it to regulate genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and lipid metabolism. The protein structure of ERRα includes a DNA-binding domain with zinc finger motifs and a ligand-binding domain that facilitates interactions with coactivators and other transcriptional regulators. ERRα's role extends to various physiological processes, including adaptive thermogenesis and circadian regulation of metabolism, as well as pathological conditions such as cancer, where its expression and activity can influence tumor progression and cell migration (Tripathi2020EstrogenRelated; Cerutti2023Multifaceted).

## Structure
Estrogen-related receptor alpha (ESRRA) is a nuclear receptor protein that plays a significant role in gene regulation. The protein structure of ESRRA includes several key domains: an N-terminal domain, a DNA-binding domain (DBD) with two zinc finger motifs, a hinge region, and a C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) (Cerutti2023Multifaceted). The DBD shares 70% amino acid identity with estrogen receptors ERα and ERβ, while the LBD shares 36-37% identity (Chisamore2009Characterization).

The LBD is crucial for receptor dimerization and interactions with transcriptional cofactors, allowing ESRRA to function without a specific ligand. This domain maintains an active conformation through specific amino acid side chains, enabling constitutive interactions with co-regulators (Cerutti2023Multifaceted). ESRRA can bind DNA as a monomer or dimer, recognizing estrogen-response elements (ERE) and ERR-response elements (ERRE) (Chisamore2009Characterization).

Post-translational modifications, such as acetylation, play a role in regulating ESRRA's activity. Acetylation of lysine residues in the DBD can reduce DNA binding and transcriptional activity, while deacetylation by SIRT1 and HDAC8 enhances DNA binding (Cerutti2023Multifaceted). These modifications, along with potential splice variants, may influence ESRRA's function and interactions.

## Function
The estrogen-related receptor alpha (ESRRA) is a nuclear receptor that plays a crucial role in regulating energy metabolism and mitochondrial function in healthy human cells. It is predominantly active in tissues with high energy demands, such as the heart, liver, brown adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle (Tripathi2020EstrogenRelated; Cerutti2023Multifaceted). ESRRA functions as a transcription factor, binding to DNA and influencing the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and lipid metabolism (Tripathi2020EstrogenRelated; Cerutti2023Multifaceted).

In brown adipose tissue, ESRRA is essential for adaptive thermogenesis, particularly during cold exposure, by regulating genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid beta-oxidation (Tripathi2020EstrogenRelated). It also plays a role in the circadian regulation of metabolism, affecting diurnal levels of glucose, triglycerides, and insulin (Tripathi2020EstrogenRelated).

ESRRA interacts with coactivators such as PPARGC1A, enhancing its transcriptional activity and promoting mitochondrial biogenesis and energy expenditure (Tripathi2020EstrogenRelated; Cerutti2023Multifaceted). It is also involved in regulating the expression of genes related to the tricarboxylic acid cycle and lipid homeostasis, sharing target genes with the mammalian target of rapamycin (MTOR) (Tripathi2020EstrogenRelated).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ESRRA gene have been implicated in various cancers. In gastric cancer, ESRRA is overexpressed, correlating with poorer prognosis, increased tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis, and advanced TNM stage. High ESRRA expression is associated with shorter overall and progression-free survival in gastric cancer patients. ESRRA promotes cancer development by regulating the cdc25c/cdk1/cyclinb1 pathway via DSN1, influencing cell cycle progression and apoptosis (Li2021ESRRA).

In thyroid cancer, particularly oncocytic carcinoma and follicular cell-originated tumors, ESRRA enhances tumor cell survival by regulating gene networks in a subtype-specific manner. It increases mortalin levels by binding to the HSPA9 promoter, which is specific to follicular cell-originated tumors. High ESRRA and mortalin expression suggest ESRRA as a potential therapeutic target for these cancers (Chen2024Estrogenrelated).

In triple-negative invasive lobular carcinoma (TN-ILC), specific ESRRA mutations have been identified, which are associated with aggressive tumor phenotypes and higher nuclear grades. These mutations are unique to TN-ILC and absent in other breast cancer subtypes, indicating a potential role in the pathogenesis of this cancer subtype (Bergeron2021Triplenegative).

## Interactions
Estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα), encoded by the ESRRA gene, is a nuclear receptor that functions as a transcription factor and interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids to regulate gene expression. ERRα forms homodimers and binds to estrogen-related response elements (ERREs) in DNA, which are often located far from the transcriptional start site of target genes (Cerutti2023Multifaceted). It interacts with coactivators such as the p160 family, including SRC-1, SRC-2, and SRC-3, which bind to its ligand-binding domain to enhance its transcriptional activity (Cerutti2023Multifaceted). 

ERRα also interacts with PGC-1α, a coactivator involved in mitochondrial energy metabolism, through the L3 motif of PGC-1α, forming a complex that regulates energy metabolism in tissues with high energy demand (Cerutti2023Multifaceted; Huss2002Peroxisome). In breast cancer, ERRα interacts with SET7, a transcriptional co-activator, to regulate genes involved in cell migration (Cerutti2022Computational). ERRα's interaction with LSD1 in breast cancer cells promotes cell migration by altering LSD1's demethylation activity (Cerutti2023Multifaceted). These interactions highlight ERRα's role in various physiological and pathological processes, including energy metabolism, cancer progression, and cell migration.
