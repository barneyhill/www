# SIRT7

## Overview
SIRT7 is a gene that encodes the protein sirtuin 7, a member of the sirtuin family of proteins, which are characterized by their NAD+-dependent deacetylase activity. Sirtuin 7 is primarily localized in the nucleolus and plays a pivotal role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and genomic stability. It is involved in various cellular processes, including ribosome biogenesis, chromatin remodeling, and DNA damage repair, through its enzymatic activity and interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids (Li2016SIRT7; Kumari2021SIRT7). Sirtuin 7's function is modulated by post-translational modifications and stress conditions, such as caloric restriction, which enhance its expression and activity (Kumari2021SIRT7). Alterations in SIRT7 expression have been implicated in several diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (LagunasRangel2022SIRT7; Wu2018Advances).

## Structure
SIRT7 is a member of the sirtuin family, characterized by its NAD+-dependent deacetylase activity. The primary structure of SIRT7 includes a conserved sirtuin core domain, which is common among sirtuins and essential for its enzymatic function (Hałasa2019Role). The secondary structure of SIRT7 features alpha helices and beta sheets, forming a large Rossmann-fold domain typical of NAD+-binding proteins (Hałasa2019Role). This domain is crucial for the binding of NAD+ and the acetyl-lysine substrate, facilitating the deacetylation reaction (Hałasa2019Role).

The tertiary structure of SIRT7 involves a small zinc-binding domain, which contributes to the stability and function of the catalytic core (Hałasa2019Role). SIRT7 can form homodimers, indicating a quaternary structure that may be important for its activity and regulation (Hałasa2019Role). The N-terminal domain of SIRT7 is rich in positively charged amino acids, playing a significant role in DNA interaction and nuclear localization (Hałasa2019Role). This domain also stabilizes the enzyme's structure through ionic interactions and hydrophobic pockets (Hałasa2019Role).

Post-translational modifications of SIRT7 include phosphorylation and acetylation, which influence its activity and stability (Hałasa2019Role). These modifications are crucial for the regulation of SIRT7's function in various cellular processes.

## Function
SIRT7 is a member of the sirtuin family, primarily localized in the nucleolus, and plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and genomic stability in healthy human cells. It is involved in ribosome biogenesis, adapting ribosome production to nutrient availability, and preventing unnecessary energy expenditure (Kumari2021SIRT7). SIRT7 regulates chromatin structure and gene expression through its desuccinylase activity, specifically targeting histone H3 lysine 122 (H3K122succ), which is essential for chromatin compaction and genome stability (Li2016SIRT7).

SIRT7 also plays a significant role in DNA damage repair by promoting chromatin condensation and stabilizing histone-DNA interactions, which are crucial for efficient DNA repair processes like homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining (Li2016SIRT7). It interacts with proteins associated with heterochromatin organization, maintaining heterochromatin stability and repressing retrotransposons, which is vital for genome integrity (Bi2020SIRT7).

SIRT7 influences mitochondrial metabolism by deacetylating GABPβ1, affecting glycolysis, and regulating mitochondrial size and respiratory-chain activity (Wu2018Advances). Its activity is modulated by stress conditions, such as caloric restriction, which enhances its expression and function, contributing to cellular and organismal integrity (Kumari2021SIRT7).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SIRT7 gene are implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers and age-related conditions. In several cancers, including breast, hepatocellular carcinoma, lung, glioblastoma multiforme, colorectal, and melanoma, SIRT7 is often overexpressed, contributing to tumor progression and poor prognosis. In breast cancer, SIRT7 is linked to higher tumor grades and lung metastases, while in hepatocellular carcinoma, it promotes cell proliferation by affecting rRNA and cyclin D1 transcription (LagunasRangel2022SIRT7). In lung cancer, SIRT7 is associated with advanced tumor stages and promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (LagunasRangel2022SIRT7). Conversely, in pancreatic cancer, SIRT7 acts as a tumor suppressor, with low levels associated with aggressive tumors (Wu2018Advances).

SIRT7 also plays a role in cardiovascular diseases, where its deficiency leads to pathological cardiac remodeling and increased fibrosis. Low SIRT7 levels are linked to cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis in humans (LagunasRangel2022SIRT7). In obesity, SIRT7 is crucial for adipogenesis, with higher levels found in adipose tissue from obese patients (LagunasRangel2022SIRT7). SIRT7 deficiency is associated with osteopenia and accelerated cartilage degradation in bone diseases (LagunasRangel2022SIRT7). These findings highlight SIRT7's significant role in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
SIRT7 is known to interact with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcription regulation and chromatin remodeling. It associates with the B-WICH complex and RNA polymerase I (Pol I), co-localizing with Pol I and Mybbp1a in the nucleoli. These interactions are independent of SIRT7's deacetylation activity and are crucial for rDNA transcription regulation (Tsai2012Functional). SIRT7 also interacts with UBF and Pol I in HEK293 cells, supporting its role in facilitating rDNA transcription (Tsai2012Functional).

SIRT7's interactome includes 233 proteins, with notable interactions involving nucleophosmin (NPM1) and nucleolin, which are linked to chromatin assembly and aging processes (Lee2014Comparative). It also interacts with Dicer, a protein involved in RNA processing, through its coiled-coil domain, indicating a direct interaction (Zhang2015Dicer).

In glucose metabolism, SIRT7 interacts with PAF53, deacetylating it to recruit RNA polymerase I to rDNA promoters, thus modulating rDNA transcription (Wu2018Advances). SIRT7 also interacts with U3 snoRNA and the U3-55k protein, promoting U3 snoRNA-dependent pre-rRNA processing, which is essential for 18S rRNA processing (Chen2016SIRT7dependent).
