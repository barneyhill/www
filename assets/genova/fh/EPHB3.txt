# EPHB3

## Overview
EPHB3 is a gene that encodes the EPH receptor B3, a member of the Eph receptor tyrosine kinase family, which is integral to various cellular signaling pathways. The EPH receptor B3 is a transmembrane protein characterized by its receptor tyrosine kinase activity, playing a pivotal role in cell communication and developmental processes. This receptor is involved in numerous physiological functions, particularly within the central nervous system, where it influences axon guidance, synaptic plasticity, and cell migration. EPHB3's interaction with its ephrin ligands, particularly ephrinB3, is crucial for mediating its dual role in promoting cell survival and inducing apoptosis, depending on the cellular context. The gene's expression and the receptor's activity are implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer and traumatic brain injury, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Arora2023Eph; Li2012EphB3; Theus2014EphrinB3).

## Structure
EPHB3, a member of the Eph receptor tyrosine kinase family, exhibits a complex molecular structure essential for its function in cell signaling. The protein is characterized by a prototypical receptor tyrosine kinase topology, which includes a multidomain extracellular region, a single transmembrane segment, and a cytoplasmic region containing the kinase domain (Lisabeth2013Eph). The extracellular region features an N-terminal ligand-binding domain, a cysteine-rich domain, an EGF-like motif, and fibronectin-type III motifs (Lackmann2008Eph). These structural components facilitate the binding of EphB3 to its ligands, the type B ephrins, which are transmembrane proteins (Lackmann2008Eph).

The cytoplasmic region of EPHB3 includes regulatory juxtamembrane domains with tyrosine phosphorylation sites, which are crucial for modulating its kinase activity (Lisabeth2013Eph). Phosphorylation of conserved tyrosines in this region is essential for activating the kinase domain and enabling efficient signaling (Lisabeth2013Eph). EPHB3 also contains a sterile-alpha-motif interaction domain and a PDZ-binding motif, which are involved in protein-protein interactions (Lackmann2008Eph).

The quaternary structure of EPHB3 involves oligomerization through receptor-ephrin and receptor-receptor interfaces, which is necessary for trans-phosphorylation and signal activation (Lisabeth2013Eph). The protein's structure is further regulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which modulate its activity and interactions (Lisabeth2013Eph).

## Function
EPHB3, a member of the Eph receptor tyrosine kinases, plays a significant role in cell signaling, particularly in the central nervous system (CNS). In healthy cells, EPHB3 is involved in maintaining homeostasis in neurogenic regions by limiting the proliferation of neural stem/progenitor cells (Theus2014EphrinB3). It is expressed in neurons within the cortex and hippocampus, including the CA3 region and dentate gyrus layers, as well as in GFAP-positive cells (Theus2014EphrinB3). EPHB3 interacts with ephrin ligands to influence processes such as axon pathfinding, cell proliferation, migration, and synaptic plasticity, which are crucial for CNS development (Theus2014EphrinB3).

EPHB3 functions as a dependence receptor, which can transduce both survival and apoptotic signals depending on ligand interaction. In the presence of its ligand, ephrinB3, EPHB3 promotes cell survival, while in its absence, it can induce cell death through caspase-mediated cleavage (Theus2014EphrinB3). This dual role is essential for regulating cell death and survival, particularly following traumatic brain injury, where EPHB3's pro-apoptotic activity can be mitigated by ephrinB3 (Theus2014EphrinB3).

## Clinical Significance
EPHB3 plays a significant role in various cancers, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and colorectal cancer (CRC). In NSCLC, EPHB3 is overexpressed in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, and its overexpression is linked to tumor growth, metastasis, and increased cell proliferation and migration. Conversely, downregulation of EPHB3 inhibits these processes, suggesting its role in NSCLC development (Arora2023Eph). EPHB3 suppresses NSCLC metastasis through a signaling complex involving PP2A, RACK1, and Akt, which inhibits cell migration. Alterations in EPHB3, such as reduced phosphorylation, are associated with increased Akt activity and potentially with the progression of NSCLC (Li2012EphB3).

In colorectal cancer, EPHB3 expression is downregulated compared to normal intestinal epithelial cells. Its expression is negatively associated with invasive depth, lymph node metastasis, and TNM stage, and positively associated with longer overall survival. Hypermethylation of the EPHB3 promoter contributes to its downregulation in CRC (Xuan2018Receptor). EPHB3 expression is initially high in adenomas but decreases as tumors progress to carcinoma, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role in CRC progression (Jang2020Expression). EPHB3's role in cancer is complex, with both tumor-suppressing and tumor-promoting functions depending on the context (Arora2023Eph).

## Interactions
EPHB3 interacts with several proteins, forming complexes that play significant roles in cellular signaling. One notable interaction is with the scaffold protein RACK1, identified through yeast two-hybrid assays. This interaction is crucial for the assembly of a signaling complex involving protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and Akt. The binding of RACK1 to EPHB3 correlates with the tyrosine phosphorylation level of EPHB3, indicating that EPHB3 activation affects RACK1 function. This interaction is important for the ligand-induced inhibition of cell migration, as silencing RACK1 desensitizes EPHB3-overexpressing cells to the anti-migratory effects of ephrin-B1-Fc (Li2012EphB3).

EPHB3 also forms a ternary complex with PP2A and Akt, facilitated by RACK1. This complex is dynamically assembled in response to EPHB3 activation and is significant in suppressing non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) metastasis. The presence of RACK1 enhances the interaction between PP2A and Akt, leading to the dephosphorylation of Akt, which is crucial for inhibiting cancer cell migration (Li2012EphB3).

In the context of traumatic brain injury, EPHB3 interacts with its ligand ephrinB3, functioning as a dependence receptor. This interaction can prevent cell death, as ephrinB3 blocks the caspase-dependent cleavage of EPHB3, highlighting its role in neuroprotection (Theus2014EphrinB3).
