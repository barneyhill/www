# ADAMTSL5

## Overview
ADAMTSL5 is a gene that encodes the ADAMTS-like 5 protein, a member of the ADAMTS superfamily, which is known for its involvement in the extracellular matrix (ECM) organization. Unlike other members of the ADAMTS family, ADAMTS-like 5 lacks the metalloprotease and disintegrin-like domains, indicating it does not possess catalytic activity (Arechederra2021ADAMTSL5). The protein is characterized by its unique domain structure, including a thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSR) and a netrin-like (NTR) module, which facilitate its interactions with ECM components such as fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 (Bader2012A). ADAMTS-like 5 is implicated in various biological processes, including tissue development and immune responses, and has been identified as an autoantigen in psoriasis (Fuentes‐Duculan2017Autoantigens). Clinically, the gene's expression is associated with tumorigenic properties and drug resistance in cancers such as hepatocellular carcinoma and melanoma, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Théret2021ADAM; Arechederra2021ADAMTSL5).

## Structure
ADAMTSL5 is a secreted protein characterized by a unique domain composition. It includes an N-terminal thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSR), a cysteine-rich module, a spacer module, and a C-terminal netrin-like (NTR) module, which is connected to the spacer by a proline-rich segment (Bader2012A). The TSR contains consensus sequences for O-fucosylation and C-mannosylation, similar to other ADAMTS proteins (Bader2012A). The protein undergoes N-glycosylation at two sites, as indicated by its migration pattern upon treatment with Peptide N-glycanase F (Bader2012A).

The NTR module at the C-terminus is involved in heparin binding and contains six cysteine residues that form disulfide bonds, contributing to its structural stability (Bader2012A). ADAMTSL5 lacks the metalloprotease and disintegrin-like domains found in other ADAMTS proteases, which means it does not have catalytic activity (Arechederra2021ADAMTSL5). The protein is associated with the extracellular matrix and binds strongly to fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2, indicating a role in microfibril assembly (Bader2012A).

Two human ADAMTSL5 cDNA transcripts, hADAMTSL5-1 and hADAMTSL5-2, have been identified, differing due to alternative splicing at the 5' end of the gene, although the mature proteins are identical (Bader2012A).

## Function
ADAMTSL5 is a member of the ADAMTS superfamily, characterized by its ability to bind fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2, which are components of microfibrils in the extracellular matrix (ECM) (Bader2012A). The protein is secreted and N-glycosylated, and it binds to the cell surface and ECM, suggesting a role in maintaining the structural integrity of the ECM and possibly in cell signaling or adhesion processes (Bader2012A). ADAMTSL5 contains a netrin-like module (NTR) that is involved in heparin-binding, allowing it to associate with cell surface or matrix heparan sulfate proteoglycans, influencing its localization in the pericellular matrix (Bader2012A).

The protein is broadly expressed in various tissues, including skeletal muscle, cartilage, and bone, as well as in many epithelia during mouse organogenesis, indicating its involvement in musculoskeletal and epithelial tissue development (Bader2012A). ADAMTSL5 does not affect microfibril assembly directly but may modify the action of other proteins on microfibril biogenesis through a competitive mechanism (Bader2012A). Its spatial distribution during mouse embryogenesis suggests a role in both epithelial and connective tissue components of organs (Bader2012A). The precise function of ADAMTSL5 in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated (Bader2012A).

## Clinical Significance
ADAMTSL5 is implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in tumorigenesis and drug resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Overexpression of ADAMTSL5 is associated with hypermethylation and is observed in a significant proportion of HCC cases, correlating with shorter overall survival and disease-free intervals in patients (Théret2021ADAM; Arechederra2021ADAMTSL5). The gene's expression is linked to tumorigenic properties and drug resistance, making it a potential biomarker for HCC and a target for therapeutic intervention (Arechederra2021ADAMTSL5).

In addition to its role in HCC, ADAMTSL5 is overexpressed in melanomas and is associated with increased methylation linked to chemoresistance in acute B lymphoblastic leukemia (Théret2021ADAM). The gene's expression is also upregulated in experimental heart failure, suggesting a role in cardiovascular health, although its specific clinical significance in this context is not fully detailed (Rypdal2024Emerging). These findings highlight the importance of ADAMTSL5 in various pathological conditions, particularly in cancer and potentially in cardiovascular diseases.

## Interactions
ADAMTSL5 is known to interact with fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2, which are key components of microfibrils in the extracellular matrix. These interactions are significant as they suggest a role for ADAMTSL5 in the structural integrity and function of the extracellular matrix, although it does not appear to accelerate microfibril biogenesis like other ADAMTS-like proteins (Bader2012A). ADAMTSL5 binds specifically to the N-terminal half of fibrillin-1 and both the N- and C-terminal halves of fibrillin-2, with a stronger affinity for the N-terminal half of fibrillin-2 (Bader2012A). 

The protein also demonstrates heparin-binding through its C-terminal netrin-like (NTR) module, which is responsible for its interaction with heparin and possibly heparan sulfate proteoglycans at the cell surface or in the matrix (Bader2012A). This heparin-binding property may influence its localization to the pericellular matrix (Bader2012A). 

In the context of disease, ADAMTSL5 is identified as an autoantigen in psoriasis, where it is co-expressed with immune cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and T-cells, suggesting a role in immune-mediated processes (Fuentes‐Duculan2017Autoantigens).
