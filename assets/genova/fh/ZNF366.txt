# ZNF366

## Overview
ZNF366 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 366, a transcriptional corepressor involved in the regulation of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) activity. The protein is characterized by its 11 Kruppel-type C2H2 zinc finger motifs, which facilitate its interaction with nuclear receptors, including ERα, and enable its DNA-binding capability (LopezGarcia2006ZNF366). ZNF366 functions primarily as a corepressor by recruiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) and C-terminal binding protein (CtBP), thereby modulating gene expression in response to estrogen signaling (LopezGarcia2006ZNF366). The gene's expression and activity are significant in the context of breast cancer, where it influences the expression of estrogen-responsive genes and cellular growth (LopezGarcia2006ZNF366).

## Structure
The ZNF366 protein is characterized by the presence of 11 Kruppel-type C2H2 zinc finger motifs, which are crucial for its DNA-binding capability and interaction with nuclear receptors, including estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) (LopezGarcia2006ZNF366). These zinc finger motifs are highly conserved across species, indicating their evolutionary importance (LopezGarcia2006ZNF366). The human ZNF366 protein is predicted to be 744 amino acids long and is encoded within 5 exons (LopezGarcia2006ZNF366).

The zinc finger region of ZNF366 is essential for its function as a corepressor, mediating interactions with ERα and other receptors. This interaction is enhanced in the presence of estrogen in vivo, although it can occur without ligand in vitro (LopezGarcia2006ZNF366). The protein also contains potential CtBP binding motifs and an LXXLL motif, which are important for its corepressor activity (LopezGarcia2006ZNF366).

ZNF366 interacts with histone deacetylases (HDACs) and CtBP1, with specific interaction motifs located C-terminal to the zinc fingers. The interaction with CtBP1 is mediated by two PXDLS motifs, and mutation of these motifs affects the corepressor function (LopezGarcia2006ZNF366). The protein's repressive activity is partially HDAC-dependent, involving interactions with Class I HDACs 1 and 3, as well as Class II HDAC6 (LopezGarcia2006ZNF366).

## Function
ZNF366, or zinc finger protein 366, functions as a corepressor for estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) in human cells. It interacts with ERα in a ligand-dependent manner, requiring the presence of estrogen or anti-estrogens for effective interaction in vivo, although in vitro assays suggest that the interaction can occur without ligands (LopezGarcia2006ZNF366). ZNF366 binds to the DNA-binding domain of ERα through its zinc finger region, which consists of 11 Kruppel-type C2H2 zinc fingers, and this interaction is enhanced by the presence of estrogen (LopezGarcia2006ZNF366).

ZNF366 acts as a transcriptional repressor by recruiting corepressors such as C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) and histone deacetylases (HDACs), which are crucial for its repressive function (LopezGarcia2006ZNF366). This repression is partially dependent on histone deacetylation, as evidenced by the relief of repression upon treatment with HDAC inhibitors (LopezGarcia2006ZNF366). In human cell lines, ZNF366 is co-expressed with ERα, and its down-regulation leads to increased expression of estrogen-responsive genes, indicating its role in regulating estrogen-responsive gene expression in vivo (LopezGarcia2006ZNF366).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
ZNF366, also known as zinc finger protein 366, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its role as a transcriptional corepressor. It interacts with estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) in a ligand-dependent manner, requiring the presence of estrogen or anti-estrogens for effective interaction. This interaction is mediated by the zinc finger region of ZNF366 and the DNA-binding domain of ERα (LopezGarcia2006ZNF366). ZNF366 acts as a corepressor for ERα by recruiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) and the C-terminal binding protein (CtBP), which are crucial for its repression activity. The interaction with CtBP is facilitated by two PXDLS motifs within ZNF366, and mutations in these motifs disrupt the interaction, reducing its corepressor function (LopezGarcia2006ZNF366).

ZNF366 also interacts with other nuclear receptors, including ERβ, androgen, glucocorticoid, retinoic acid, retinoid X, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, indicating its broad role in nuclear receptor signaling (LopezGarcia2006ZNF366). In breast cancer cells, ZNF366 reduces the expression of ERα-regulated genes and inhibits cell growth in response to estrogen, highlighting its significance in estrogen-responsive pathways (LopezGarcia2006ZNF366).
