# LRP11

## Overview
The LRP11 gene encodes the LDL receptor related protein 11, a member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family, which is involved in various cellular processes, including lipid metabolism and signal transduction. As a receptor protein, LRP11 plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses and cancer cell behavior through its interactions with other proteins and signaling pathways. It is particularly significant in the context of cancer, where its expression levels have been linked to tumor progression and prognosis in liver hepatocellular carcinoma and cervical cancer. LRP11's involvement in pathways such as the Wnt signaling and its interaction with kinases like MAPK13 highlight its potential as a therapeutic target, especially in enhancing the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies (Yoo2024Comprehensive; Sun2024LRP11).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LRP11 gene have been implicated in various cancers, particularly liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) and cervical cancer. In LIHC, LRP11 expression is significantly higher in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and high levels of LRP11 are associated with poor overall survival, recurrence-free survival, progression-free survival, and disease-specific survival. This suggests that LRP11 could serve as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for LIHC (Yoo2024Comprehensive). The gene's expression is linked to immune cell infiltration and immune-modulating functions, which may influence the tumor microenvironment and cancer progression (Yoo2024Comprehensive).

In cervical cancer, LRP11 acts as a tumor promoter, with higher expression levels observed in high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and cervical cancer tissues. Silencing LRP11 in cervical cancer cell lines results in inhibited cell proliferation, reduced migration and invasion, and suppressed tumor growth, indicating its role in cancer progression. LRP11 expression is also associated with poor prognosis and differentiation degree in cervical cancer (Wang2019&lt; p&gt; The).

LRP11's role in promoting stem-like T cells via MAPK13-mediated TCF1 phosphorylation has been shown to enhance the efficacy of anti-PD1 immunotherapy, suggesting its potential as a target for improving cancer immunotherapy outcomes (Sun2024LRP11).

## Interactions
LRP11 (LDL receptor related protein 11) is involved in various interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes and cancer progression. In liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), LRP11 interacts with proteins involved in molecular functions such as binding and catalytic activity, and biological processes like cellular processes and biological regulation. It is also associated with pathways including the Wnt signaling pathway and inflammation mediated by chemokine and cytokine signaling (Yoo2024Comprehensive).

In prostate cancer stem cells, LRP11 interacts with several proteins, including Protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 14C (PPP1R14C), Glycoprotein integral membrane 1 (GINM1), Protein maestro (MRO), Protein-L-isoaspartate(D-aspartate) O-methyltransferase (PCMT1), and Sortilin-related receptor (SORL1). It also interacts with other low-density lipoprotein receptor domain-containing proteins such as LRP1B, LRP12, LRP10, and LRP8 (SONER2023Expression).

In the context of T-cell reprogramming and immunotherapy, LRP11 interacts with MAPK13, a kinase that phosphorylates the transcription factor TCF1. This interaction enhances the proliferation and cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells, contributing to improved antitumor immunity (Sun2024LRP11). These interactions highlight LRP11's role in modulating immune responses and cancer cell behavior.
