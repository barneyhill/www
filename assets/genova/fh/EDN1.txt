# EDN1

## Overview
The EDN1 gene encodes endothelin 1, a potent vasoconstrictor peptide that plays a crucial role in the regulation of vascular tone and blood pressure. Endothelin 1 is a member of the endothelin family of peptides, characterized by their compact structure stabilized by disulfide bridges. The gene is expressed primarily in endothelial cells, where it undergoes complex post-translational processing to produce the mature, bioactive peptide. Endothelin 1 exerts its effects through interactions with G protein-coupled receptors, specifically endothelin A (ETAR) and endothelin B (ETBR) receptors, which mediate various physiological and pathological processes, including vasoconstriction, cell proliferation, and cancer progression (Rosanò2013Endothelin; Dagamajalu2020A). The EDN1 gene and its encoded protein are implicated in several clinical conditions, such as persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn and coronary microvascular dysfunction, highlighting its significance in cardiovascular health and disease (Mei2016EDN1; Ford2020Genetic).

## Structure
Endothelin 1 (EDN1) is a peptide encoded by the EDN1 gene, primarily known for its role in vasoconstriction. The primary structure of EDN1 consists of 21 amino acids, derived from a larger precursor protein, preproendothelin-1 (ppET-1), which is initially 212 amino acids long (Gordon2013Mutations). The processing of ppET-1 involves several proteolytic cleavages, including the removal of an N-terminal signal sequence and cleavage by furin and ECE enzymes, to produce the mature, bioactive EDN1 peptide (Gordon2013Mutations).

The secondary structure of EDN1 includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its stable conformation. The tertiary structure is characterized by a compact shape stabilized by two intra-chain disulfide bridges formed by four cysteine residues, a hallmark of the endothelin family of peptides (Yuzugulen2017Characterisation). These disulfide bridges are crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and biological activity of the peptide.

EDN1 does not typically form quaternary structures. Post-translational modifications include the cleavage from its precursor and the formation of disulfide bridges, which are essential for its function as a potent vasoconstrictor (Yuzugulen2017Characterisation).

## Function
Endothelin-1 (EDN1) is a potent vasoconstrictor peptide primarily secreted by endothelial cells, playing a critical role in regulating vascular tone and blood pressure. It interacts with endothelin receptors, EDNRA and EDNRB, which are G protein-coupled receptors. EDNRA is associated with vasoconstriction and cellular proliferation, while EDNRB is involved in vasodilation and inhibition of growth and inflammation (Dagamajalu2020A).

In cardiac function, EDN1 is crucial for maintaining normal contractile function and regulating oxidative stress through a superoxide-MMP9 cascade. It ensures adequate myocardial collagen to prevent overstretching, influencing myocardial structure and function (Hathaway2015Endothelin1). EDN1 also promotes sodium excretion and inhibits ENaC activity via endothelin B receptors, which is essential for maintaining normal blood pressure and plasma volume (Hathaway2015Endothelin1).

In the context of cardiovascular progenitors, EDN1 supports the clonal expansion and maintenance of these cells derived from human embryonic stem cells. It acts through autocrine and paracrine mechanisms, contributing to the formation of vascular lineages and functional cardiac-like tissues (Soh2016Endothelin1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the EDN1 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. In neonates, the EDN1 gene variant, particularly the rs2070699 T allele, is linked to persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). This allele is associated with higher endothelin-1 (ET-1) levels and increased risk of PPHN, characterized by elevated pulmonary vascular resistance and severe hypoxemia (Mei2016EDN1).

In patients with renal failure, specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the EDN1 gene, such as rs2248580, rs2070699, and rs4714384, are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular complications. These genetic variants may influence disease phenotypes through non-coding RNA, transcriptional regulation, or splicing alterations, contributing to conditions like left ventricular hypertrophy and congestive heart failure (Kao2017Associations).

The rs9349379-G allele in the EDN1 gene is linked to coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD), a condition associated with angina and characterized by impaired coronary flow reserve. This allele is associated with higher plasma ET-1 levels and increased risk of CMD, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of this condition (Ford2020Genetic).

Mutations in EDN1 are also implicated in auriculocondylar syndrome (ACS) and isolated question-mark ears (IQMEs), with specific mutations affecting the furin recognition site of proEDN1, essential for its cleavage and function (Gordon2013Mutations).

## Interactions
Endothelin 1 (ET1), encoded by the EDN1 gene, interacts with endothelin receptors, primarily endothelin A receptor (ETAR) and endothelin B receptor (ETBR), which are G protein-coupled receptors. These interactions activate various signaling pathways, including MAPK, PI3K-AKT, and NF-κB, contributing to processes such as cancer progression, vasoconstriction, and cell proliferation (Rosanò2013Endothelin; Torres2021Endothelin-1).

ET1-ETAR interaction is significant in cancer, where it recruits β-arrestin, mediating the PI3K-integrin linked kinase (ILK)-AKT signaling pathway. This interaction inhibits the β-catenin destruction complex, leading to β-catenin accumulation and activation of target genes like EDN1, MMP2, and CCND1 (Rosanò2013Endothelin). ET1 also interacts with integrins, particularly β1 integrin, enhancing cell adhesion and migration, which are crucial for tumor cell invasion (Rosanò2013Endothelin).

In the context of hypoxia, ET1 stabilizes hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α), promoting the transcription of genes such as VEGFA, which is involved in angiogenesis (Rosanò2013Endothelin). ET1 also influences the activity of enzymes like cyclooxygenase (COX), leading to increased prostaglandin E2 production, which is implicated in tumor angiogenesis and invasiveness (Rosanò2013Endothelin).
