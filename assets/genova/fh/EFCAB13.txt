# EFCAB13

## Overview
EFCAB13 is a gene that encodes the EF-hand calcium binding domain 13 protein, which is integral to calcium ion binding and cellular signaling processes. The protein is characterized by the presence of an EF-hand motif, a structural domain that enables the binding of calcium ions, thereby playing a crucial role in various cellular functions such as muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, and cell cycle regulation. EFCAB13 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm or associated with cellular membranes, where it modulates calcium signaling to maintain cellular homeostasis. This regulation is essential for coordinating complex cellular activities and ensuring appropriate physiological responses to stimuli. The gene has also been implicated in the susceptibility to multiple sclerosis, with certain genetic variants affecting its expression and function, thereby influencing immune processes (Clarelli2022Contribution; Putscher2022Genetic).

## Structure


## Function
EFCAB13 encodes a protein that plays a significant role in calcium ion binding, a vital process in cellular signaling. The protein contains an EF-hand motif, a helix-loop-helix structural domain that facilitates the binding of calcium ions. This binding is crucial for various cellular functions, including muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, and cell cycle regulation. The activity of the EFCAB13 protein is typically localized in the cytoplasm or associated with cellular membranes, where calcium signaling is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function. By influencing calcium ion dynamics, EFCAB13 contributes to the regulation of intracellular processes that are critical for the proper functioning of cells and tissues. The precise modulation of calcium levels by EFCAB13 is necessary for the coordination of complex cellular activities, ensuring that physiological responses are appropriately executed in response to internal and external stimuli.

## Clinical Significance
EFCAB13 has been implicated in multiple sclerosis (MS) susceptibility, particularly through rare and low-frequency genetic variants. The stop-gain variant rs118004742 in EFCAB13 has been consistently associated with MS across multiple cohorts, showing a higher frequency in MS patients. This variant may lead to transcript degradation via a nonsense-mediated decay mechanism, resulting in reduced RNA and protein levels, which could impact immune processes (Clarelli2022Contribution). 

Additionally, the presence of the MS risk allele C of splice SNP rs3851808 in EFCAB13 is associated with increased expression and preferential inclusion of exons 9 and 10. This genotype dependency suggests a potential link between EFCAB13 splicing patterns and MS risk, highlighting the role of alternative splicing in the disease's pathogenesis (Putscher2022Genetic). 

The gene's expression is observed in various tissues, including immune cells, suggesting its involvement in immune-related processes. However, the clinical significance of these findings requires further investigation to fully understand the gene's role in MS and other potential conditions (Clarelli2022Contribution; Putscher2022Genetic).
