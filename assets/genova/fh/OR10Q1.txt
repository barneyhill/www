# OR10Q1

## Overview
OR10Q1 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 10 subfamily Q member 1, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein is primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a significant role in the olfactory system by initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. The OR10Q1 gene is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, triggering neuronal responses essential for olfactory perception (van2017Genomescale). Beyond its role in olfaction, OR10Q1 is also expressed in various peripheral tissues, suggesting potential roles in physiological processes outside of smell, including possible implications in respiratory functions and COVID-19 pathology (An2018Taste; Kerslake2020Co‑expression).

## Function
OR10Q1 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein involved in the detection of odor molecules. This receptor is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. OR10Q1 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, triggering neuronal responses that contribute to the sense of smell (van2017Genomescale).

In addition to its role in olfaction, OR10Q1 is expressed in various peripheral tissues, including adipose tissue, breast, salivary gland, pancreas, and testis (Kerslake2020Co‑expression). This widespread expression suggests potential roles beyond olfactory perception, possibly influencing physiological processes in these tissues. The co-expression of OR10Q1 with key mediators of SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as ACE2 and TMPRSS2, indicates that it may have implications in COVID-19 pathology, particularly in relation to disease severity and progression (Kerslake2020Co‑expression).

The presence of OR10Q1 in human airway smooth muscle cells also suggests a potential role in respiratory functions, possibly linked to conditions like asthma (An2018Taste). However, the specific molecular functions of OR10Q1 in these non-olfactory tissues remain to be fully elucidated.
