# PASK

## Overview
PASK, or PAS domain containing serine/threonine kinase, is a gene that encodes a protein kinase involved in various cellular processes, particularly in nutrient sensing and energy metabolism. The PASK protein is characterized by its PAS domains, which are sensor motifs, and a serine/threonine kinase domain, classifying it as a kinase. This protein plays a pivotal role in glucose homeostasis by regulating insulin and glucagon secretion in pancreatic islet cells, and it is activated in response to high glucose levels. PASK's function extends to modulating glycogen metabolism and lipid synthesis, acting as a cellular nutrient sufficiency sensor. It interacts with key protein complexes, such as the H3K4 MLL2 methyltransferase complex and mTORC1, influencing transcriptional regulation and cellular differentiation. Clinically, mutations in the PASK gene have been associated with metabolic disorders like diabetes and obesity, highlighting its significance in metabolic regulation and potential implications in disease pathogenesis (Zhang2015PerArntSim; Semplici2011Human; DeMille2013PAS).

## Structure
The human PASK protein is characterized by its distinct molecular structure, which includes multiple PAS domains and a serine/threonine kinase domain. The primary structure of PASK features two PAS domains at the N-terminal, followed by a serine/threonine kinase domain and a hydrophilic tail (Rutter2001PAS). The secondary structure of the PAS domains typically involves a 5α/5β fold, which is crucial for their function as sensor motifs (Dhungel2024Nutrient).

The tertiary structure of PASK is influenced by the PAS domains, which facilitate intramolecular interactions and protein-protein interactions. The PAS-C domain, in particular, is formed through interactions between PAS and PAC motifs, playing a significant role in the protein's quaternary structure and catalytic activation (Dhungel2024Nutrient). The quaternary structure of PASK involves the assembly of these domains, which is dynamically regulated by nutrient signaling and phosphorylation events, such as those mediated by mTORC1 (Dhungel2024Nutrient).

Post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, are critical for PASK's regulation and activation. These modifications can influence the protein's conformation and interaction with other domains, impacting its catalytic activity (Rutter2001PAS). The presence of splice variant isoforms of PASK has not been explicitly detailed in the provided context.

## Function
PASK (PAS domain containing serine/threonine kinase) is a nutrient-sensing protein kinase that plays a crucial role in glucose homeostasis and energy metabolism in healthy human cells. It is involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism by influencing insulin and glucagon secretion in pancreatic islet cells. PASK is activated by high glucose levels, which increase its mRNA and protein levels, and it is necessary for the glucose-stimulated expression of preproinsulin and pancreatic duodenum homeobox-1 (PDX-1) genes, essential for insulin gene expression and pancreatic development (Semplici2011Human; DeMille2013PAS).

In pancreatic β-cells, PASK modulates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and its deletion leads to reduced insulin secretion, indicating its role in insulin production through the phosphorylation of transcription factors like PDX-1 (Zhang2015PerArntSim). PASK also negatively regulates glycogen synthase, an enzyme responsible for glycogen synthesis, thereby influencing glycogen metabolism and maintaining glucose and energy homeostasis (DeMille2013PAS).

PASK functions as a cellular nutrient sufficiency sensor, integrating multiple cues to monitor cellular energetic status. Its activity is cell type-specific, contributing to insulin secretion in β-cells and lipid synthesis in hepatocytes (Hao2007PAS).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PASK gene have been linked to several metabolic disorders, including diabetes and obesity. The p.G1117E mutation in the PASK gene is associated with increased kinase activity and basal insulin hypersecretion, which may contribute to altered glucose metabolism and potentially influence the development of diabetes. However, this mutation does not consistently correlate with the diabetic phenotype, suggesting it may act as a modifier rather than a direct cause (Semplici2011Human). 

PASK deficiency has been shown to protect against obesity and insulin resistance in mice by enhancing AMPK activity, which is involved in energy homeostasis and lipid metabolism. This suggests that PASK plays a role in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism, and its deficiency can lead to increased oxidative phosphorylation and reduced fat accumulation (Zhang2015PerArntSim; Pape2018PerArntSim). 

In addition, PASK is implicated in the regulation of glucagon secretion, with its downregulation observed in human islets in type 2 diabetes. This highlights its potential role in glucose homeostasis and the pathogenesis of diabetes (da2010Perarntsim). Alterations in PASK expression have also been noted in a patient with autism and 2q37.3 deletion syndrome, suggesting a broader impact on neurological functions (Felder2009FARP2).

## Interactions
PASK, or PAS domain containing serine/threonine kinase, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. PASK has been identified as a binding partner of WDR5, a component of the H3K4 methyltransferase complexes. This interaction is part of the H3K4 MLL2 methyltransferase complex, which includes other core members such as ASH2, RBBP5, and the methyltransferase enzyme MLL2. PASK directly interacts with WDR5, suggesting a specific association with the H3K4 MLL2 complex, which is involved in the regulation of H3K4 methylation (Karakkat2019The).

PASK also interacts with mTORC1, a key player in nutrient and insulin signaling. mTORC1 phosphorylates PASK at multiple residues, which is necessary for its activation. This phosphorylation enhances PASK's association with WDR5, which is crucial for inducing Myog transcription and promoting myogenesis. The interaction between PASK and WDR5 is linked to epigenetic changes at the Myog promoter, facilitating the onset of the myogenesis program (Kikani2019Activation).

These interactions highlight PASK's role in modulating transcriptional regulation and cellular differentiation through its association with key protein complexes and signaling pathways.
