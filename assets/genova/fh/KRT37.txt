# KRT37

## Overview
KRT37 is a gene that encodes the protein keratin 37, which is a type I hair keratin. Keratin 37 is a structural protein that plays a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of hair fibers, contributing to their mechanical strength and resilience. This protein is predominantly expressed in the medullary cells of hair follicles, particularly in regions influenced by androgens, such as beards, axillary, and pubic hair. The expression of KRT37 is regulated by androgens, which bind to specific elements in the gene's promoter region, thereby influencing hair growth and development (Ramot2009Endocrine). Additionally, keratin 37 is implicated in the differentiation and formation of hair follicles, as evidenced by its upregulation in response to keratin treatment in outer root sheath cells, which is associated with the activation of key developmental genes like SOX9 and β-catenin (An2022Keratinmediated).

## Function
KRT37, or keratin 37, is a type I hair keratin gene that plays a significant role in the structural integrity and mechanical resilience of hair fibers. It is involved in the assembly of keratin filaments, contributing to hair strength and texture. KRT37 is expressed in the medullary cells of hair follicles, particularly in male and female sexual hair follicles, such as those found in beards, axillary, and pubic regions. This expression is regulated by androgens, as the promoter of KRT37 contains an androgen transactivatable-response element, indicating a direct regulatory mechanism by these hormones (Ramot2009Endocrine).

In the context of hair growth, KRT37 is upregulated in outer root sheath cells treated with keratin, suggesting its role in hair germ formation and differentiation. This upregulation is associated with increased expression of genes involved in hair follicle development, such as SOX9 and β-catenin, highlighting its importance in the biological processes underlying hair growth (An2022Keratinmediated). Despite these insights, the specific molecular mechanisms and direct evidence for androgen regulation of KRT37 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated (Ramot2009Endocrine).
