# RNF10

## Overview
RNF10 is a gene that encodes the ring finger protein 10, a multifunctional protein characterized by its RING finger domain, which confers E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. This protein plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including synaptic signaling, transcriptional regulation, and ribosome quality control. As an E3 ubiquitin ligase, ring finger protein 10 is involved in the ubiquitination of ribosomal proteins, contributing to the maintenance of ribosome homeostasis (Garzia2021The). In neurons, it functions as a synaptonuclear messenger, linking synaptic activity to nuclear gene expression, which is crucial for synaptic plasticity and memory formation (Dinamarca2016Ring). Additionally, RNF10 is implicated in myelination processes in Schwann cells and has been associated with various pathological conditions, including cancer and intellectual disabilities, highlighting its significance in both cellular and organismal homeostasis (Dinamarca2016Ring; Hoshikawa2008A).

## Structure
The RNF10 protein is characterized by a RING finger domain, a type of zinc finger motif, located between amino acids 225 and 270, which is crucial for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (Seki2000cDNA; Dinamarca2016Ring). This domain coordinates two zinc cations and is essential for the ubiquitination process, particularly in the ubiquitination of ribosomal proteins RPS2 and RPS3 (Garzia2021The). The protein also contains a Meox2 Binding Domain (MBD) between amino acids 101 and 185, and two nuclear localization sequences (NLS1 and NLS2) at amino acids 591-599 and 784-791, respectively, which facilitate its nuclear translocation (Dinamarca2016Ring).

RNF10 is involved in synaptonuclear signaling, where it acts as a messenger between synapses and the nucleus, particularly in response to NMDA receptor activation (Dinamarca2016Ring). The protein's interaction with the GluN2A subunit of NMDA receptors is modulated by calcium and calmodulin, affecting its synaptic and nuclear distribution (Dinamarca2016Ring). RNF10's role in synaptic signaling and nuclear communication is further supported by its interaction with importin proteins, which mediate its nuclear import (Dinamarca2016Ring). The protein's structure and domains are integral to its function in cellular processes such as transcriptional regulation and DNA repair (Seki2000cDNA).

## Function
RNF10 (ring finger protein 10) is involved in several critical molecular processes in human cells. It functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a key role in the ubiquitination of ribosomal proteins RPS2 and RPS3, which are components of the 40S ribosomal subunit. This ubiquitination is part of a quality-control mechanism that manages ribosomes compromised in translation initiation and elongation, thereby maintaining ribosome homeostasis and ensuring the fidelity of cellular protein synthesis (Garzia2021The).

In neurons, RNF10 acts as a synaptonuclear messenger, linking synaptic activity to nuclear gene expression. It is involved in the nuclear translocation process following the activation of NMDA receptors, particularly those containing the GluN2A subunit. This translocation is crucial for the regulation of genes associated with synaptic plasticity, such as p21 WAF1/cip1 and Ophn1, and is essential for long-term potentiation (LTP), a process important for memory formation (Dinamarca2016Ring).

RNF10 is also active in Schwann cells, where it regulates the expression of the myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) gene, influencing myelination processes (Hoshikawa2008A). These diverse roles highlight RNF10's importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RNF10 gene, particularly its circular RNA form circRNF10, have been implicated in various cancers. In glioblastoma (GBM), circRNF10 is significantly upregulated and associated with poor prognosis. It promotes GBM progression by inhibiting ferroptosis in glioma stem cells (GSCs), thereby enhancing cell viability, proliferation, and stemness (Wang2023CircRNF10). CircRNF10 interacts with proteins such as ZBTB48 and IGF2BP3, forming a feedback loop that facilitates oncogenic signaling and ferroptosis defense, contributing to tumor growth and survival (Wang2023CircRNF10).

In contrast, in breast cancer (BC), circRNF10 is downregulated and acts as a tumor suppressor. Its lower expression correlates with advanced tumor stages and poorer prognosis. CircRNF10 inhibits BC progression by disrupting the DHX15-NF-κB p65 positive feedback loop, which is crucial for continuous NF-κB signaling activation (Zheng2023CircRNF10DHX15).

Beyond cancer, RNF10 is involved in neuronal function, particularly in synaptic signaling and plasticity. Alterations in RNF10 expression can affect synaptic components and dendritic spine morphology, potentially linking it to intellectual disability syndromes (Dinamarca2016Ring).

## Interactions
RNF10 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in synaptic signaling and transcriptional regulation. It binds to the GluN2A subunit of NMDA receptors, and this interaction is modulated by phosphorylation at Ser31, which is crucial for RNF10's dissociation from the receptor and subsequent nuclear translocation (Carrano2019The). RNF10 also interacts with importin, a protein that facilitates its nuclear import, particularly through the NLS2 motif, which is essential for its nuclear localization (Dinamarca2016Ring).

In the nucleus, RNF10 binds to the transcription factor Meox2, influencing the expression of target genes such as p21 WAF1/cip1 and Ophn1 (Dinamarca2016Ring; Lin2005Characterization). This interaction with Meox2 has been confirmed through various experimental techniques, including pull-down assays and immunoprecipitation (Lin2005Characterization).

RNF10 is also involved in the monoubiquitination of stalled ribosomes, targeting 40S ribosomal proteins RPS2 and RPS3, which suggests its role in ribosome quality control pathways (Garzia2021The). These interactions highlight RNF10's multifaceted role in cellular processes, including synaptic plasticity and protein synthesis regulation.
