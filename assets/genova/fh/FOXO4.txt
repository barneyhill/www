# FOXO4

## Overview
FOXO4 is a gene that encodes the forkhead box O4 protein, a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors. This protein is characterized by a conserved forkhead (FKH) DNA-binding domain, which plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression in response to various cellular stimuli. As a transcription factor, forkhead box O4 is involved in critical cellular processes, including oxidative stress response, apoptosis, and cell cycle regulation. It achieves these functions through interactions with other proteins and post-translational modifications that influence its activity and localization. The protein's ability to modulate the expression of genes such as superoxide dismutase-2 (SOD2) underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and protecting against oxidative damage (Araujo2011FOXO4dependent; Huang2007Dynamic). Additionally, forkhead box O4 has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, where its regulatory functions are disrupted (Farhan2017FOXO; Hu2019Roles).

## Structure
FOXO4 is a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors, characterized by a conserved forkhead (FKH) DNA-binding domain. This domain is approximately 100 amino acids long and is crucial for binding to specific DNA sequences known as FoxO-recognized elements (FRE) (Link2018Introduction; Huang2007Dynamic). The FKH domain features a winged-helix structure, which includes three major α-helices and two large wing-like loops essential for DNA interaction (Huang2007Dynamic).

FOXO4 undergoes various post-translational modifications that regulate its activity and stability. Phosphorylation by kinases such as AKT and JNK influences its subcellular localization and transcriptional activity. For instance, JNK phosphorylates FOXO4 at threonine residues 447 and 451, promoting nuclear localization under oxidative stress (Tzivion2011FoxO; Huang2007Dynamic). Ubiquitination also plays a significant role, with Mdm2 acting as an E3 ligase that mono-ubiquitinates FOXO4, enhancing its nuclear localization and transcriptional activity (Brenkman2008Mdm2). Deubiquitylation by USP7 can reverse this process, leading to cytoplasmic relocation (Huang2007Dynamic).

The regulation of FOXO4 is complex, involving interactions with other proteins and transcription factors, which modulate its function in cellular processes such as apoptosis and stress response (Link2018Introduction).

## Function
FOXO4 is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in regulating various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in the response to oxidative stress, where it regulates the expression of genes such as superoxide dismutase-2 (SOD2), which is crucial for the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Araujo2011FOXO4dependent). FOXO4 interacts with ATXN3 to enhance SOD2 transcription, a process that involves the translocation of both proteins to the nucleus and binding to the SOD2 gene promoter (Araujo2011FOXO4dependent). This activity helps protect cells from oxidative damage and maintain cellular homeostasis (Araujo2011FOXO4dependent).

FOXO4 also plays a role in regulating the transcriptional activity of NF-κB, a key transcription factor involved in inflammation. In healthy cells, FOXO4 inhibits NF-κB's DNA binding activity, thereby modulating cytokine expression and maintaining intestinal barrier integrity (Zhou2009FoxO4). This function is crucial for preventing excessive immune responses and maintaining gut health (Zhou2009FoxO4). FOXO4's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination, which affect its nuclear localization and stability (Brenkman2008Mdm2).

## Clinical Significance
FOXO4 is implicated in various diseases, primarily through its role in cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. In cancer, FOXO4 is involved in chromosomal translocations that result in fusion proteins with the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene, particularly in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). These fusion proteins contribute to leukemogenesis, highlighting FOXO4's role in tumor development and progression (Farhan2017FOXO; Maiese2008OutFOXOing). FOXO4 acts as a tumor suppressor, and its inactivation is an early event in tumorigenesis. Mice lacking FOXO4, along with FOXO1 and FOXO3, develop lymphoproliferative diseases and hemangiomas, indicating its critical role in preventing neoplastic growth (Farhan2017FOXO; Maiese2008OutFOXOing).

In neurodegenerative diseases, FOXO4 is involved in oxidative stress responses. It translocates to the nucleus to regulate genes that increase stress resistance, such as the sod-2 gene, which is relevant in conditions like spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (Hu2019Roles). Alterations in FOXO4 expression or function can influence the progression of neurodegenerative diseases by affecting oxidative stress and cellular apoptosis (Hu2019Roles).

## Interactions
FOXO4 interacts with various proteins that influence its transcriptional activity and cellular localization. One significant interaction is with the Ku heterodimer (Ku70/Ku80), which is crucial for DNA double-strand break repair. This interaction inhibits FOXO4-mediated transcription of the p27 kip1 gene and G1 cell cycle arrest, and is sensitive to oxidative stress levels (Daitoku2011Regulation).

FOXO4 is also regulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by AKT, which leads to its interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. This binding reduces FOXO4's transcriptional activity by limiting its nuclear presence and DNA binding ability (Tzivion2011FoxO). Phosphorylation by JNK at specific sites promotes FOXO4's nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity, independent of 14-3-3 binding (Tzivion2011FoxO).

Acetylation and deacetylation also play roles in FOXO4 regulation. Acetylation by CBP/p300 impairs its DNA-binding ability, while deacetylation by SIRT1 enhances its function, particularly under oxidative stress conditions (Daitoku2011Regulation). These interactions suggest that FOXO4's activity is modulated through a complex network of protein-protein interactions and post-translational modifications.
