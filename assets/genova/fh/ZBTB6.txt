# ZBTB6

## Overview
ZBTB6 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger and BTB domain containing 6 protein, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. This protein is characterized by the presence of a BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-Ã -brac) domain and multiple zinc finger motifs, which are typically involved in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. The zinc finger and BTB domain containing 6 protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including gene expression regulation and chromatin remodeling. It functions primarily as a transcriptional regulator, influencing the expression of target genes by binding to specific DNA sequences. The protein's role in these processes suggests its potential involvement in developmental pathways and disease mechanisms, although further research is needed to fully elucidate its functions and interactions within the cell (Qiu2020aarFDC).
