# CEP97

## Overview
CEP97, or centrosomal protein 97, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is integral to centrosome function and ciliogenesis. The protein, categorized as a centrosomal protein, is characterized by its coiled-coil domains that facilitate interactions with other proteins, such as CP110, forming a complex that acts as a negative regulator of ciliogenesis. This complex is crucial for maintaining the balance of cilia formation by capping the distal ends of centrioles, thereby preventing premature cilia assembly (Huang2018MPhase). CEP97 is also involved in the formation of aggresomes, cellular structures that sequester misfolded proteins, highlighting its role in protein quality control and cellular homeostasis (Prosser2022Aggresome). The gene's expression and function are tightly regulated, with implications for neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, due to its involvement in centriole duplication and cell cycle regulation (Aydogan2021Centriole).

## Structure
CEP97 (centrosomal protein 97) is characterized by its involvement in centrosome function and ciliogenesis. The protein contains specific domains such as coiled-coil regions, which are crucial for facilitating protein-protein interactions. These regions contribute to the structural integrity and functional capabilities of CEP97 by enabling it to interact with other proteins within the centrosome.

The primary structure of CEP97 is defined by its unique amino acid sequence, which dictates the protein's specific properties and interactions. In terms of secondary structure, CEP97 may include elements such as alpha helices and beta sheets, which are common in proteins that require stability and flexibility for their functions. The tertiary structure of CEP97 refers to its overall three-dimensional shape, which is essential for its role in cellular processes.

CEP97 may also undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can regulate its activity and interactions with other cellular components. These modifications are critical for the dynamic regulation of CEP97's function in the cell. Additionally, splice variant isoforms of CEP97 may exist, contributing to the protein's functional diversity and allowing it to participate in various cellular pathways.

## Function
CEP97 is a centrosomal protein that plays a critical role in regulating ciliogenesis and centrosome function in healthy human cells. It forms a complex with CP110 at the distal ends of centrioles, acting as a negative regulator of ciliogenesis by stabilizing CP110 and preventing premature cilia formation (Huang2018MPhase). CEP97 is involved in the cyclical recruitment to centrioles during the S-phase of the cell cycle, with its levels peaking in mid-S-phase, which correlates with the timing of centriole microtubule growth (Aydogan2021Centriole).

CEP97 also interacts with M-phase phosphoprotein 9 (MPP9), which recruits the CP110-CEP97 complex to the mother centriole, inhibiting cilia assembly in cycling cells (Huang2018MPhase). The removal of MPP9, facilitated by TTBK2 signaling, leads to the displacement of CEP97 and CP110, promoting ciliogenesis (Huang2018MPhase).

In addition to its role in ciliogenesis, CEP97 is part of a complex with CP110 and CEP290 that is crucial for the formation of aggresomes, cellular structures that sequester misfolded proteins, which is relevant to neurodegenerative diseases (Prosser2022Aggresome). This highlights its involvement in maintaining cellular homeostasis and protein quality control.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the CEP97 gene can have significant clinical implications. CEP97 is involved in centrosome function and ciliogenesis, and disruptions in these processes can lead to various diseases. Abnormalities in CEP97 interactions are implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Huntington's disease, where protein aggregation is a hallmark. The CP110-CEP97-CEP290 module, which includes CEP97, plays a crucial role in the assembly of aggresomes, cellular structures that concentrate misfolded proteins for clearance. This process is particularly relevant in the context of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by protein inclusions (Prosser2022Aggresome).

CEP97 is also associated with the regulation of centriole cartwheel growth, influencing the oscillation of Polo-like kinase 4 (Plk4), which is crucial for centriole duplication. Alterations in CEP97 levels can affect centriole growth, potentially leading to defects in cell division and contributing to cancer progression (Aydogan2021Centriole). While specific diseases directly linked to CEP97 mutations are not extensively documented, its role in critical cellular processes suggests that disruptions could contribute to ciliopathies and cancer due to its involvement in cell cycle regulation and cilia function (Aydogan2021Centriole).

## Interactions
CEP97, a centrosomal protein, is known for its interactions with several other proteins, primarily forming a complex with CP110. This CP110-CEP97 complex plays a crucial role in regulating ciliogenesis and centrosome function. CEP97 directly interacts with CP110, and together they act as negative regulators of ciliogenesis by capping the distal end of centrioles, thus preventing cilia formation in cycling cells (Prosser2020The; Huang2018MPhase).

CEP97 also interacts with M-phase phosphoprotein 9 (MPP9), which recruits the CP110-CEP97 complex to the mother centriole. This interaction is essential for the regulation of cilia formation, as MPP9 facilitates the removal of the CP110-CEP97 complex from the mother centriole, promoting ciliogenesis (Huang2018MPhase).

In the context of aggresome formation, CEP97 is part of the CP110-CEP97-CEP290 module, which is involved in the assembly of aggresomes at the centrosome. This module is crucial for the recruitment of proteins to the centrosome and the formation of aggresomes, which are cellular structures that sequester misfolded proteins (Prosser2022Aggresome; Prosser2020The). CEP97's interaction with other proteins like TALPID3 and CEP120 is also noted, forming ring-like structures central to aggresome assembly (Prosser2022Aggresome).
