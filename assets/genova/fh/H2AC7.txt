# H2AC7

## Overview
The H2AC7 gene encodes the H2A clustered histone 7 protein, which is a variant of the histone H2A family. Histones are essential components of chromatin, the complex of DNA and protein found in eukaryotic cell nuclei, and play a critical role in the regulation of gene expression by facilitating the compaction and organization of DNA into nucleosomes. The H2A clustered histone 7 protein is involved in the structural framework of chromatin and contributes to the dynamic regulation of chromatin accessibility, thereby influencing various cellular processes such as DNA replication, repair, and transcription. As a member of the histone protein family, H2A clustered histone 7 is integral to maintaining genomic stability and regulating the epigenetic landscape of the cell (Qiu2020aarFDC).
