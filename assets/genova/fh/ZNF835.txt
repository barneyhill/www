# ZNF835

## Overview
ZNF835 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 835, which is characterized by the presence of a C2H2-type zinc finger domain. This domain is integral to the protein's ability to bind DNA, a common feature among zinc finger proteins, which often play roles in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling. Zinc finger protein 835 is implicated in the structural formation of nucleoprotein complexes, particularly on exosomes, where it may interact with other DNA-binding proteins. The gene has garnered attention for its potential prognostic significance in various cancers, including uveal melanoma and lung adenocarcinoma, where it is part of gene expression signatures associated with survival outcomes (Lamas2021Prognostic; Zengin2021Comprehensive). Additionally, mutations in ZNF835 have been detected in circulating tumor DNA in colorectal cancer, suggesting its potential role in cancer recurrence (Nagayama2023Mutated).

## Structure
ZNF835 is a zinc finger protein characterized by the presence of a C2H2-type zinc finger domain, which is a common motif in proteins that interact with DNA. This domain typically involves the coordination of zinc ions to stabilize the protein's fold, facilitating its DNA-binding capabilities (Tutanov2022Blood). The primary structure of ZNF835 is rich in cysteine and histidine residues, which are crucial for the formation of the zinc finger motif. The secondary structure likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which are common in zinc finger proteins. The tertiary structure is stabilized by zinc ions, which help maintain the protein's conformation necessary for DNA interaction.

ZNF835 is known for its high affinity for nucleosome binding, suggesting a role in the structural formation of nucleoprotein complexes on exosomes (Tutanov2022Blood). This protein is part of the exosomal crown, potentially interacting with other DNA-binding proteins such as H2a, H2b, H3, IGHM, and ALB, indicating a quaternary structure involving protein-protein interactions (Tutanov2022Blood). Common post-translational modifications in zinc finger proteins, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, may also be present in ZNF835, although specific modifications for this protein are not detailed in the available context.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZNF835 has been identified as a gene with potential prognostic significance in various cancers. In uveal melanoma (UM), a 14-gene model including ZNF835 was associated with tumor-free survival and metastasis status. This model was validated using external datasets and demonstrated superior predictive power for overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) compared to traditional clinical parameters (Lamas2021Prognostic). The study suggested that pathways related to immune regulation might be involved, indicating a possible link between chromosomal gains and reduced survival in UM due to immune system dysfunction (Lamas2021Prognostic).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), ZNF835 was part of a gene expression signature that showed high prognostic power in distinguishing between low- and high-risk groups for overall survival. Although ZNF835 had not been previously related to carcinoma, its inclusion in this signature suggests its potential role in cancer prognosis (Zengin2021Comprehensive).

ZNF835 was also mentioned in the context of colorectal cancer, where its mutation was detected in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) during postoperative recurrence. However, the study did not provide specific information on diseases or conditions directly associated with ZNF835 mutations or expression alterations (Nagayama2023Mutated).
