# MRE11

## Overview
The MRE11 gene encodes the MRE11 homolog, a double-strand break repair nuclease that is a pivotal component of the MRN complex, which also includes RAD50 and NBS1. This protein plays a crucial role in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), a fundamental process for maintaining genomic stability and proper cell cycle regulation. As a nuclease, MRE11 is involved in the processing of DNA ends, facilitating homologous recombination by generating 3′ overhangs necessary for this repair pathway. The protein's interaction with RAD50 and NBS1 is essential for the structural and functional integrity of the MRN complex, which acts as a sensor for DSBs and is involved in DNA damage checkpoint signaling. Mutations in the MRE11 gene are linked to various genetic disorders and cancers, highlighting its importance in genomic maintenance and disease prevention (Rahman2020A; Buis2008Mre11; Delia2004MRE11).

## Structure
The MRE11 protein is a crucial component of the MRN complex, which is essential for DNA double-strand break repair. Structurally, MRE11 forms a dimer, with each monomer contributing to a four-helix bundle interface that is vital for its function in DNA end bridging and nuclease processing (Williams2008Mre11). The protein contains a nuclease domain with five conserved phosphodiesterase motifs, which are responsible for coordinating catalytic Mn2+ ions necessary for its exonuclease and endonuclease activities (Rahman2020Mutation). 

MRE11 interacts with RAD50 through a Rad50 binding domain (RBD), which binds to the coiled-coil domain of RAD50, forming a heterotetrameric structure with a dimer of dimers configuration (Tisi2020Functional). This interaction is crucial for the stability and function of the MRN complex, as it facilitates ATP-induced conformational changes that enhance DNA-binding activity (Lammens2011The). 

The MRE11 protein is structurally flexible, with distinct N-terminal and C-terminal regions connected by a disordered linker, allowing for significant conformational changes (Tisi2020Functional). It also undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may regulate its activity and interactions within the MRN complex.

## Function
The MRE11 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the MRN complex, which also includes RAD50 and NBS1. This complex plays a vital role in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in human cells, contributing to genomic stability and cell cycle regulation. MRE11 possesses nuclease activity, specifically a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity, which is essential for processing DNA ends during repair (Paull1998The; Reginato2020The). Within the MRN complex, MRE11 primarily degrades the 5′-terminated strand by endonucleolytic cleavage to generate 3′ overhangs necessary for homologous recombination (HR), a key DNA repair pathway (Reginato2020The).

MRE11 is involved in the early steps of HR, as evidenced by its role in the formation of RPA and Rad51 foci, which are critical for this pathway (Buis2008Mre11). It also plays a role in activating the ATR kinase, which is important for responding to DNA replication stress (Buis2008Mre11). The MRN complex acts as a sensor for DSBs, localizing to damage sites and facilitating DNA damage checkpoint signaling (Buis2008Mre11). MRE11's nuclease activities are indispensable for maintaining genomic stability, as deficiencies lead to increased chromosomal instability and early embryonic lethality (Buis2008Mre11).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MRE11 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions, primarily due to their impact on DNA repair mechanisms. Ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder (ATLD) is a notable condition resulting from MRE11 mutations. This disorder is characterized by neurodegeneration, oculomotor apraxia, and increased radiosensitivity, with symptoms often presenting later and progressing more slowly than in ataxia-telangiectasia (Delia2004MRE11). Patients with ATLD typically exhibit impaired ATM-dependent responses, which are crucial for DNA repair and cell cycle regulation (Delia2004MRE11).

MRE11 mutations can also lead to chromosomal instability and are linked to various cancers, including colorectal, breast, and ovarian cancers (Rahman2020A). Specific mutations, such as those affecting the interaction with NBS1, can impair the MRN complex's function, leading to defective DNA damage signaling and repair (Regal2013Disease-associated). These mutations can disrupt homologous recombination and double-strand break repair, contributing to genomic instability and cancer predisposition (Rahman2020A). The clinical significance of MRE11 mutations underscores their critical role in maintaining genomic integrity and their potential impact on disease pathogenesis.

## Interactions
The MRE11 protein is a key component of the MRN complex, which includes RAD50 and NBS1. This complex is essential for DNA double-strand break repair and plays a significant role in DNA damage response signaling. MRE11 interacts with RAD50 and NBS1 to form a hetero-tetrameric assembly, with RAD50 providing ATPase activity and NBS1 serving as a regulatory docking protein (Syed2018The). MRE11's interaction with RAD50 is crucial for regulating its nuclease activities, as RAD50 limits MRE11's 3'→5' exonuclease activity and facilitates endonucleolytic cleavage (Reginato2020The).

MRE11 also interacts with CtIP, which is important for DNA end resection, a critical step in homologous recombination. This interaction is necessary for CtIP-dependent double-strand break repair (Buis2012Mre11). Additionally, MRE11 is involved in the activation of ATM kinase, which phosphorylates various substrates to amplify the DNA damage response (Syed2018The).

The MRN complex, including MRE11, is recruited to DNA replication origins by replication protein A (RPA), although this interaction is minimally involved in damage repair (Olson2007The). MRE11's interactions with other proteins, such as Hsp90 and RNF8, influence its stability and recruitment to DNA double-strand breaks (Syed2018The).
