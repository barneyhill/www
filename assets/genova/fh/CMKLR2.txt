# CMKLR2

## Overview
CMKLR2, or chemerin chemokine-like receptor 2, is a gene that encodes a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in immune system regulation. The protein product of CMKLR2 is characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices, a structural feature typical of GPCRs, which facilitates its role in signal transduction across cell membranes. CMKLR2 is primarily implicated in the chemotaxis of immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, through its interaction with the ligand chemerin. This receptor is expressed in various tissues and plays a critical role in directing immune cells to sites of inflammation or injury, thereby contributing to immune defense mechanisms and maintaining immune homeostasis. The receptor's function in modulating inflammatory processes and metabolic regulation underscores its significance in both local and systemic immune responses (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Structure
CMKLR2, or chemerin chemokine-like receptor 2, is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by its primary structure of seven transmembrane alpha-helices. These helices are a hallmark of GPCRs and form the secondary structure of the protein. The tertiary structure of CMKLR2 involves the folding of these helices into a functional receptor capable of interacting with ligands and initiating intracellular signaling pathways. The quaternary structure may involve dimerization or interaction with other proteins, which is common among GPCRs to modulate their activity and function.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a crucial role in regulating the activity of CMKLR2. These modifications can influence receptor signaling, trafficking, and interactions with other cellular proteins. The specific domains and prominent folds of CMKLR2 contribute to its role in immune response and inflammation, although detailed structural information beyond the general GPCR framework is not provided in the available context. The presence of splice variant isoforms is not mentioned, indicating that further research may be needed to explore this aspect of CMKLR2.

## Function
CMKLR2, or chemerin chemokine-like receptor 2, is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a significant role in the regulation of immune responses. It is primarily involved in the chemotaxis of immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, by binding to its ligand, chemerin. This interaction is crucial for directing the movement of these cells to sites of inflammation or injury, thereby contributing to the body's immune defense mechanisms. CMKLR2 is expressed in various tissues, where it influences inflammatory processes and metabolic regulation. Its activity is essential for maintaining immune homeostasis and facilitating appropriate immune responses. The receptor's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in both local and systemic immune regulation, impacting organismal outcomes such as inflammation and metabolic balance.
