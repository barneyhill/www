# IGSF5

## Overview
IGSF5 is a gene that encodes the protein immunoglobulin superfamily member 5, also known as JAM4. This protein is a transmembrane component of the immunoglobulin superfamily, which is primarily involved in cell adhesion processes. IGSF5 plays a significant role in maintaining the integrity and function of cell junctions, particularly in epithelial and endothelial cells, by forming adhesion machinery at tight junctions. This is crucial for regulating the permeability of tissues such as the kidney glomerulus and the small intestinal epithelium (Izumi2015RNASeq). The protein is also involved in signaling pathways that influence cell polarity, migration, and barrier function, thereby contributing to tissue integrity and homeostasis (Grandi2016Contribution). The gene is highly conserved across species, underscoring its essential role in cellular processes (Sturgeon2011Transcript). Despite its recognized importance, further research is needed to fully understand the specific molecular activities and broader implications of IGSF5 in human health and disease.

## Function
IGSF5, also known as JAM4, is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily involved in cell adhesion processes. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and function of cell junctions, particularly in epithelial and endothelial cells. IGSF5, in conjunction with MagI1, forms an adhesion machinery at tight junctions, which is essential for regulating the permeability of the kidney glomerulus and the small intestinal epithelium (Izumi2015RNASeq). This function is vital for maintaining tissue structure and function in healthy human cells.

IGSF5 is also implicated in signaling pathways that regulate cell polarity, migration, and barrier function, contributing to tissue integrity and homeostasis. The protein is active in cell junctions, where it helps maintain the structural integrity necessary for proper cellular communication and function (Grandi2016Contribution). The gene is well conserved across species, indicating its essential role in cellular processes (Sturgeon2011Transcript). Despite its importance, the specific molecular activities of IGSF5 in healthy human cells remain an area of ongoing research, with its precise contributions to various cellular and organismal outcomes still being elucidated.
