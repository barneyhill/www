# TERB2

## Overview
TERB2, or telomere repeat binding bouquet formation protein 2, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the meiotic telomere complex. The TERB2 protein is a key component of the TERB1-TERB2-MAJIN complex, which is essential for tethering telomeres to the nuclear envelope during meiosis. This complex facilitates the proper alignment and movement of chromosomes, which is crucial for homologous pairing and synapsis formation. Structurally, TERB2 interacts with both TERB1 and MAJIN, forming a stable assembly that is vital for the transmission of cytoskeletal forces necessary for chromosomal movements in prophase I of meiosis (Dunce2018Structural; Wang2019The). The protein's interactions with telomere-associated proteins and its role in recruiting TRF1 dimers underscore its importance in maintaining genomic integrity and fertility (Dunce2018Structural). Disruptions in TERB2 function can lead to meiotic arrest and infertility, highlighting its clinical significance, particularly in the context of male infertility (Fakhro2024Conserved; Krausz2020Editorial).

## Structure
The TERB2 protein is a crucial component of the meiotic TERB1-TERB2-MAJIN complex, which tethers telomeres to the nuclear envelope. Structurally, TERB2 interacts with both TERB1 and MAJIN, forming a stable complex. The N-terminal domain (NTD) of TERB2, comprising residues 1-116, features a three-stranded β sheet and six α helices. This domain interacts with a specific binding motif in TERB1 (residues 587-636), forming a helix-turn-helix motif stabilized by hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, with a zinc ion playing a key role (Dunce2018Structural; Wang2019The).

The C-terminal fragment of TERB2 (residues 168-202) interacts with the N-terminal domain of MAJIN (residues 2-149), forming an extended structure that wraps around MAJIN, primarily driven by van der Waals interactions and stabilized by an intermolecular anti-parallel β sheet (Wang2019The). The MAJIN-TERB2 complex forms a 2:2 heterotetramer, essential for the assembly of the full 2:2:2 MAJIN-TERB2-TERB1 complex (Dunce2018Structural).

TERB2's N-terminal domain also contains a conserved motif (FxLxP), resembling the canonical binding motif for shelterin-associated proteins, indicating potential interactions with TRF1 and TRF2 (da2020The; da2021investigating). This structural configuration is vital for the protein's role in meiotic telomere attachment.

## Function
TERB2 (telomere repeat binding bouquet formation protein 2) is a crucial component of the TERB1-TERB2-MAJIN complex, which plays a significant role in meiotic telomere attachment to the nuclear envelope (NE). This attachment is essential for proper chromosome movement, homologous pairing, and synapsis formation during meiosis. TERB2 interacts with TERB1 and MAJIN to form a stable complex that tethers telomeres to the NE, facilitating the transmission of cytoskeletal forces necessary for rapid chromosomal movements in prophase I of meiosis (Dunce2018Structural; Wang2019The).

The TERB2 protein is involved in recruiting TRF1 dimers, which bring telomeric DNA into proximity for loading onto the MAJIN-TERB2-TERB1 complexes. This process is crucial for the structural organization and force transmission required for meiotic telomere attachment and movement (Dunce2018Structural). Disruption of TERB2 function leads to misalignment of telomeres, impaired double-strand break repair, and failure of homologous recombination, resulting in meiotic arrest and infertility (Wang2019The).

In summary, TERB2 is vital for maintaining telomere-NE attachment, facilitating homologous recombination, and ensuring proper meiotic progression, which are essential for fertility and genomic integrity (Wang2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TERB2 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in relation to male infertility. Disruption of the TERB1-TERB2-MAJIN complex, which includes TERB2, is essential for meiosis in both mice and humans. Such disruptions can lead to nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA) in men, a condition characterized by the absence of sperm in the ejaculate (Fakhro2024Conserved). Recessive mutations in TERB2 are proposed as novel causes of meiotic arrest in humans, contributing to NOA (Krausz2020Editorial). 

The structural integrity of the MAJIN-TERB2-TERB1 complex is crucial for meiotic telomere attachment to the nuclear envelope, and any alterations in TERB2 can affect this process. The MAJIN-TERB2 complex forms a 2:2 heterotetramer, and its stability is vital for proper DNA binding and telomere dynamics during meiosis (Dunce2018Structural). Although the structural studies provide insights into the molecular interactions of TERB2, they do not directly address the clinical significance of TERB2 gene mutations or their association with diseases (Dunce2018Structural). However, the disruption of these interactions is implied to have potential consequences for reproductive health.

## Interactions
TERB2 is a key component of the meiotic telomere complex, interacting with MAJIN and TERB1 to form a 2:2:2 hetero-hexameric assembly that is crucial for telomere attachment to the nuclear envelope. The C-terminus of TERB2 interacts with the N-terminal globular core of MAJIN, while its N-terminus binds to the TERB2-binding site of TERB1. This interaction facilitates the recruitment of TRF1 dimers, which are essential for the structural organization and function of the meiotic telomere complex (Dunce2018Structural).

The MAJIN-TERB2 complex forms a stable 2:2 heterotetramer, with TERB2 wrapping around the MAJIN β-grasp fold, contributing to the complex's DNA-binding capability. This interaction is mediated by hydrophobic side-chain insertions and a salt bridge between specific residues (Dunce2018Structural).

TERB2 also plays a role in connecting telomere-associated proteins to the LINC complex during meiosis. In mice, TERB2, along with TERB1 and MAJIN, is essential for linking TRF1 to LINC complexes, which involves the inner nuclear envelope protein MAJIN and the meiotic LINC complex components SUN1 and KASH5 (Kim2022How).
