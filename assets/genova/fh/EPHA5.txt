# EPHA5

## Overview
EPHA5 is a gene that encodes the EPH receptor A5, a member of the Eph receptor family, which is characterized by its receptor tyrosine kinase activity. This protein plays a crucial role in cellular signaling, particularly within the nervous system, where it is involved in neural development, axon guidance, and synaptic plasticity. The EPHA5 protein is composed of several functional domains, including a ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane segment, and a cytoplasmic kinase domain, which facilitate its role in signal transduction and protein-protein interactions (Liang2019Eph; Sahoo2021Structural). EPHA5 is expressed predominantly in the brain, where it contributes to the formation and maintenance of neuronal networks, influencing processes such as memory and learning (Cooper2009Distribution). Additionally, EPHA5 has been implicated in various cancers, with mutations in the gene affecting tumor progression and response to immunotherapy (Li2022EPHA5; Chen2020EPHA5).

## Structure
The EPHA5 protein is a member of the Eph receptor family, characterized by its receptor tyrosine kinase activity. The primary structure of EPHA5 includes a sequence of amino acids that form various functional domains. The secondary structure features alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and function (Sahoo2021Structural).

The tertiary structure of EPHA5 involves a three-dimensional folding that includes a ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane segment, and a cytoplasmic kinase domain. The transmembrane domain is associated with motifs such as the GAS (glycine zipper) and heptad motifs, which are important for dimerization and signal transduction (Sahoo2021Structural). The SAM (Sterile Alpha Motif) domain is crucial for protein-protein interactions, facilitating dimerization and oligomerization, and modulating the activity of the adjacent kinase domain (Liang2019Eph).

EPHA5 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which is essential for its signaling functions (Liang2019Eph). The protein may also exist in different splice variant isoforms, which could affect its function or localization (Zhou1998The). These structural features enable EPHA5 to play a significant role in cellular signaling and developmental processes.

## Function
EPHA5, a member of the Eph receptor family, is primarily expressed in the nervous system and plays a significant role in neural development and function. It is involved in axon guidance, synaptic plasticity, and the formation of neuronal networks. In the adult human central nervous system, EPHA5 is widely distributed across various brain regions, including the hippocampus, neocortex, thalamus, and amygdala, suggesting its involvement in maintaining synaptic integrity and neural plasticity (Cooper2009Distribution; Olivieri1999Immunohistochemical).

EPHA5 interacts with ephrin ligands to initiate bidirectional signaling, which influences cell adhesion, positioning, and migration. This signaling is crucial for the topographical orientation of neuronal systems and the guidance of neuronal pathways during development (Miao2012EphA). In the thalamus, EPHA5 is involved in thalamocortical projections and regulates intrathalamic connections, which are essential for memory and learning (Cooper2009Distribution).

The protein is active in the cell membrane, where it plays a role in maintaining the long-term survival and synaptic integrity of certain neuronal populations, similar to other receptor tyrosine kinases (Olivieri1999Immunohistochemical). Its expression in the adult brain indicates potential roles in regulating animal behavior and synaptic plasticity (Cooper2009Distribution).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EPHA5 gene have been implicated in various cancers, particularly lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In LUAD, EPHA5 mutations are associated with enhanced immune responses, characterized by increased recruitment of CD8+ T cells and M1 macrophages, and reduced recruitment of immunosuppressive cells. These mutations correlate with higher tumor mutational burden (TMB) and tumor neoantigen burden (TNB), which are indicators of a more immunogenic tumor environment. Patients with EPHA5 mutations in LUAD often exhibit prolonged survival when treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), suggesting that these mutations could serve as predictive markers for favorable immunotherapy outcomes (Chen2020EPHA5; Huang2020EPHA5a).

In contrast, EPHA5 mutations in NSCLC are associated with poorer outcomes when treated with atezolizumab, a PD-L1 targeting immunotherapy. Studies have shown that these mutations are linked to a higher tumor mutational burden but do not improve overall survival in patients receiving atezolizumab. This suggests that EPHA5 mutations may serve as a biomarker for poor response to this specific treatment (Li2022EPHA5; Wang2021PDL1). These findings highlight the complex role of EPHA5 mutations in cancer progression and treatment response.

## Interactions
EPHA5, a member of the Eph receptor family, engages in various interactions with other proteins, primarily through its binding with ephrin ligands. EphA5 interacts with ephrin-A5, which enhances cell adhesion to fibronectin and influences cell morphology via integrin-dependent mechanisms. This interaction involves the phosphorylation of downstream effectors such as FAK and MAPK, promoting neurite outgrowth and axon guidance (Cecchini2022EphEphrinBased).

In the context of breast cancer, EPHA5 interacts with several proteins as identified through protein-protein interaction analyses using STRING and GeneMANIA. These interactions include partners like EFNA5, EFNA4, EFNA1, EFNA3, EFNA2, ARHGEF15, EFNB2, ACP1, NGEF, CHN1, ADAM10, EFNB1, EFNB3, BLK, MAP3K1, CDK5, FGR, YES1, EPHB2, and HCK. These interactions are involved in various biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions, such as protein binding, transferase activity, and ion binding (Zhang2021The).

In the nervous system, EPHA5 is implicated in synaptic plasticity and learning, interacting with PDZ proteins at synaptic sites. This interaction influences synaptic plasticity and is involved in cytoskeletal processes, such as actin polymerization, affecting synaptic transmission and plasticity (Gerlai1999Regulation).
