# ZNF536

## Overview
ZNF536 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 536, a transcriptional repressor characterized by its ten Kruppel-like C2H2 zinc finger domains. These domains are integral to the protein's ability to bind DNA and regulate gene expression, particularly in the context of neuronal differentiation (Qin2009ZNF536). The protein is predominantly expressed in the brain, where it modulates retinoic acid-induced gene transcription by interacting with retinoic acid response elements and the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARα) (Qin2009ZNF536). ZNF536's role extends to various biological processes, including neuronal differentiation and cancer pathways, through its interactions with other proteins such as CtBP1, a corepressor involved in gene transcription (Qin2009ZNF536). The gene's mutations and expression alterations have been implicated in diseases like lung adenocarcinoma and neuropsychiatric disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (Xu2019Analysis; Kim2024Impairments).

## Structure
ZNF536 is a zinc finger protein characterized by the presence of ten Kruppel-like C2H2 zinc finger domains, which are crucial for its function as a DNA-binding transcriptional repressor (Qin2009ZNF536). These zinc finger domains are highly conserved across vertebrates, indicating their importance in the protein's function (Kim2024Impairments). The protein also contains a CtBP-binding motif, which is essential for its role in inhibiting neuronal differentiation and retinoic acid-induced activity (Qin2009ZNF536).

The primary structure of the human ZNF536 protein consists of 1,300 amino acids, while the mouse ortholog has 1,302 amino acids, with an 88% identity at the amino acid level between the two species (Qin2009ZNF536). The zinc finger domains contribute to the protein's secondary and tertiary structures, facilitating its interaction with DNA and other proteins. Although specific details about the quaternary structure are not provided, the presence of multiple zinc finger domains suggests a complex folding pattern that enables its function as a transcriptional repressor. The protein's structure allows it to bind to retinoic acid response elements (RARE) and interfere with the binding of retinoic acid receptor α (RARα), thereby modulating gene expression (Qin2009ZNF536).

## Function
ZNF536 is a zinc finger protein specifically expressed in the brain, where it functions as a transcriptional repressor. It plays a critical role in regulating neuronal differentiation by modulating retinoic acid (RA)-induced gene transcription. ZNF536 achieves this by binding to retinoic acid response elements (RARE) and disrupting the binding of retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARα), thereby inhibiting the expression of RA-induced genes (Qin2009ZNF536). This interaction is crucial for maintaining the balance of neuronal differentiation processes in the brain, as overexpression of ZNF536 inhibits, while its depletion enhances, the expression of neuron-specific marker genes (Qin2009ZNF536).

ZNF536 is localized in neuronal cells, particularly in regions such as the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and hypothalamic area, and is absent in glial cells (Qin2009ZNF536). It contains 10 Kruppel-like C2H2 zinc fingers and a CtBP-binding motif, which are indicative of its role as a transcriptional repressor (Qin2009ZNF536). The protein's expression pattern and its interaction with corepressors like CtBP1 suggest that ZNF536 is involved in regulating gene transcription related to neuron differentiation, maintaining the differentiated state of neurons and neural stem cells (Qin2009ZNF536).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ZNF536 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and neuropsychiatric disorders. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), ZNF536 mutations are associated with significant changes in gene expression, affecting pathways related to the cell cycle, mismatch repair, and DNA replication, which are critical in cancer development (Xu2019Analysis). These mutations may serve as potential biomarkers for prognosis and therapy targets in LUAD (Zeng2024Characterization).

ZNF536 is also linked to neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder. Genetic variants, including single-nucleotide polymorphisms and rare protein-truncating variants, have been associated with these conditions. Studies using zebrafish models have shown that knockout of ZNF536 leads to impairments in cerebellar structure and function, reduced anxiety-like behavior, and decreased social interaction, suggesting its role in brain development and the pathophysiology of these disorders (Kim2024Impairments).

Overall, ZNF536's alterations in expression and mutations are significant in both oncogenic processes and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
ZNF536, a zinc finger protein, is involved in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, primarily influencing neuronal differentiation and cancer pathways. It interacts with the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARα) by binding to retinoic acid response elements (RARE) in gene promoters, thereby inhibiting RARα's ability to bind to these elements and repressing retinoic acid-induced gene transcription (Qin2009ZNF536). This interaction suggests that ZNF536 functions as a negative regulator of neuronal differentiation by modulating the transcriptional activity of RARα.

ZNF536 also interacts with CtBP1, a corepressor for gene transcription, as identified through yeast two-hybrid screening. This interaction indicates that ZNF536 may participate in multiprotein complexes that regulate gene expression in the brain (Qin2009ZNF536). The protein contains 10 Kruppel-like C2H2 zinc fingers and a CtBP-binding motif, which are crucial for its function in inhibiting neuronal differentiation and retinoic acid-induced activity (Qin2009ZNF536).

In cancer, ZNF536 is associated with various biological processes, including angiogenesis and differentiation, and interacts with a network of related genes such as AATK and PLP1, suggesting roles in axon development and neuronal cell body control (wu2023Comprehensive).
