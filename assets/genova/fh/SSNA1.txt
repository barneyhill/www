# SSNA1

## Overview
The SSNA1 gene encodes the SS nuclear autoantigen 1 protein, also known as NA14, which is a microtubule-associated protein involved in various cellular processes, including microtubule stabilization, cilia function, and cell division. This protein is characterized by its coiled-coil structure, allowing it to self-assemble into higher-order filaments and interact with other proteins, such as the microtubule-severing enzyme spastin, to modulate microtubule dynamics (Lawrence2021SSNA1; Price2012The). SSNA1 plays a critical role in maintaining microtubule integrity by slowing growth, shrinkage, and catastrophe rates while promoting rescue, thus ensuring proper cellular function (Lawrence2021SSNA1). Clinically, SSNA1 is recognized as an autoantigen in Sjögren's syndrome, highlighting its significance in autoimmune disease contexts (Price2012The).

## Structure
The SSNA1 protein, also known as NA14, is characterized by its coiled-coil structure, which is a significant feature of its molecular architecture. This protein is a small, approximately 14 kDa, coiled-coil protein that self-assembles into higher-order filaments (Lawrence2021SSNA1). The coiled-coil regions cover over 70% of the SSNA1 sequence, allowing it to form fibril-like structures, which may contribute to its immunogenicity (Price2012The). These structural features are shared with other autoantigens associated with rheumatic diseases, such as the golgin family of proteins and the centrosomal protein pericentrin (Price2012The).

SSNA1 is known to bind with the microtubule-severing protein spastin and the G-protein coupled receptor TPRA40, indicating its role in microtubule dynamics (Price2012The). It modulates microtubule dynamic instability by slowing down growth, shrinkage, and catastrophe rates while promoting rescue (Lawrence2021SSNA1). SSNA1 also detects spastin-induced damage and inhibits spastin's severing activity, acting as both a stabilizer and sensor of microtubule damage (Lawrence2021SSNA1). The protein's ability to form stable filaments resembling amyloid fibrils may be relevant to its role as an autoantigen (Price2012The).

## Function
The SSNA1 gene encodes the Sjögren's Syndrome Nuclear Autoantigen 1 (SSNA1/NA14), a microtubule-associated protein that plays a crucial role in stabilizing dynamic microtubules and detecting microtubule damage in healthy human cells. SSNA1 is involved in several cellular processes, including cilia function, cell division, and neuronal development. In cilia, SSNA1 localizes to basal bodies and axonemes, which are essential for proper cilium assembly and intraflagellar transport (Lawrence2021SSNA1). During cell division, SSNA1 is enriched at spindle poles and the midbody, ensuring accurate cell division (Lawrence2021SSNA1).

SSNA1 modulates microtubule dynamic instability by slowing growth, shrinkage, and catastrophe rates while promoting rescue. It accumulates on dynamic microtubule ends, correlating with a slowdown in growth rate, and prevents catastrophe even when tubulin is removed or sequestered (Lawrence2021SSNA1). SSNA1 also detects spastin-induced damage and inhibits spastin's severing activity, acting as a microtubule stabilizer and damage sensor (Lawrence2021SSNA1). These functions are critical for maintaining microtubule integrity, which is essential for cellular processes such as cilia formation, cell division, and axonal branching (Lawrence2021SSNA1).

## Clinical Significance
The SSNA1 gene is clinically significant due to its association with autoimmune diseases. It is recognized as an autoantigen in Sjögren's syndrome, an autoimmune disorder affecting the tear and saliva glands. Approximately 14% of primary Sjögren's syndrome cases test positive for autoantibodies against SSNA1, indicating its role as a minor but specific autoantigen for this condition (Price2012The). The protein encoded by SSNA1 shares structural similarities with other autoantigens linked to rheumatic diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjögren's syndrome, due to its coiled-coil conformation (Price2012The).

In Trypanosoma brucei, the orthologue of SSNA1, known as TbDIP13, is immunogenic and can induce antibody production in human African trypanosomiasis patients. This suggests a potential role in immune recognition, although the antibody response may be transient and more characteristic of early infection (Price2012The). The possibility of cross-reactivity between antibodies from Trypanosoma brucei infection and human SSNA1 raises concerns about potential autoimmune complications (Price2012The). Further research is needed to explore these interactions and their clinical implications.

## Interactions
SSNA1 is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It is known to interact with the microtubule-severing enzyme spastin, where SSNA1 inhibits spastin-mediated microtubule severing and recognizes sites of lattice damage. This interaction is significant for stabilizing microtubules and modulating their dynamic instability (Lawrence2021SSNA1). SSNA1 also plays a role in the ciliary transport system by linking the IFT-B complex to the KIF3 complex, indicating its involvement in intraflagellar transport (Boldt2016An).

In the context of centriole stability, SSNA1 interacts with proteins such as ZYG-1 in C. elegans, which is crucial for maintaining proper centriole number and preventing fragmentation (Pfister2024TheC.). SSNA1 also genetically interacts with SAS-1, contributing to centriole stability post-assembly (Pfister2024TheC.). These interactions highlight SSNA1's role in ensuring the structural integrity of centrioles and proper cell division.

In Trypanosoma brucei, the SSNA1 orthologue, TbDIP13, has been shown to interact with microtubule-associated proteins, although these interactions are not directly applicable to human SSNA1 due to differences in protein localization and function (Price2012The).
