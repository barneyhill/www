# TAT

## Overview
The TAT gene encodes the enzyme tyrosine aminotransferase, which is a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent aminotransferase involved in the catabolism of the amino acid tyrosine. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in converting tyrosine into p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, a critical step in the metabolic pathway that prevents the accumulation of toxic tyrosine byproducts. Tyrosine aminotransferase is primarily expressed in the liver, with additional expression in the kidneys and brain, and is essential for maintaining normal tyrosine levels in the blood. The enzyme's activity is modulated by its interaction with the cofactor pyridoxal-5′-phosphate and can be affected by oxidative conditions. Mutations in the TAT gene can lead to disorders such as tyrosinemia type II, and alterations in its expression are implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (Fu2010Downregulation; Mehere2010Tyrosine; Natt1992Point).

## Structure
Tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) is an enzyme encoded by the TAT gene, playing a crucial role in the catabolism of the amino acid tyrosine. The primary structure of TAT consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that are encoded by the TAT gene. The secondary structure of TAT includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its overall stability and function. The tertiary structure of TAT forms a specific three-dimensional shape that is essential for its enzymatic activity. This structure allows TAT to interact effectively with its substrates and cofactors.

TAT can form homodimers, which represent its quaternary structure. This dimerization is important for its biological function. A key feature of TAT is the pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) binding domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity. PLP acts as a cofactor, facilitating the transfer of amino groups during the catabolic process.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are common in TAT and can regulate its activity. These modifications may influence the enzyme's stability, activity, and interaction with other molecules. Understanding the structural aspects of TAT is vital for comprehending its role in metabolic pathways and its regulation within the cell.

## Function
Tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the catabolism of the amino acid tyrosine. It catalyzes the reversible transamination of tyrosine to p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, a key step in the metabolic pathway that breaks down tyrosine into harmless molecules, which are either excreted by the kidneys or used in energy-producing reactions (Fu2010Downregulation; Mehere2010Tyrosine). TAT is primarily expressed in the liver, where it is most active, but it is also present in the kidneys and brain (Mehere2010Tyrosine). 

In healthy human cells, TAT is crucial for maintaining normal levels of tyrosine in the blood, preventing the toxic accumulation of tyrosine and its byproducts, which can damage the liver, kidneys, nervous system, and other organs (Fu2010Downregulation). The enzyme's activity is influenced by its interaction with the pyridoxal-5′-phosphate cofactor and can be inactivated under oxidative conditions, although this inactivation is reversible with reducing agents (Mehere2010Tyrosine). TAT's function is essential for normal amino acid metabolism and energy production, highlighting its importance in cellular and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TAT gene are associated with tyrosinemia type II, also known as Richner-Hanhart syndrome. This autosomal recessive disorder is characterized by elevated blood tyrosine levels, leading to symptoms such as keratitis, palmoplantar hyperkeratosis, and intellectual disability (Natt1992Point; Westphal1988The). The condition results from various point mutations in the TAT gene, including nonsense mutations and splice site alterations, which lead to the inactivation of the enzyme tyrosine aminotransferase (Natt1992Point).

Alterations in TAT expression levels are implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The TAT gene, located at 16q22.1, is frequently down-regulated in HCC due to loss of one allele and hypermethylation of its promoter region. This down-regulation is linked to the tumor suppressive role of TAT, as its re-expression in HCC cell lines inhibits tumor formation by promoting apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway (Fu2010Downregulation). The loss of TAT function in HCC may also contribute to elevated tyrosine levels, which is a known risk factor for liver cancer (Fu2010Downregulation).

## Interactions
Tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) is a pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme that participates in various protein-protein interactions, which are crucial for its function in amino acid metabolism. TAT interacts with PLP donors such as pyridoxal kinase (PdxK) and pyridox(am)in-5′-phosphate oxidase (PNPO) through a common structural motif that facilitates the transfer of PLP, essential for its enzymatic activity (Aleshin2023Protein–Protein). This motif is characterized by an alpha-helix, a beta-strand, and loop regions, which are spatially accessible and play a role in protein-protein interactions (Aleshin2023Protein–Protein).

Mutations in TAT, such as A237P, L201R, and L273P, can disrupt these interactions, affecting the enzyme's catalytic efficiency and leading to conditions like Richner-Hanhart syndrome (tyrosinemia type II) (Aleshin2023Protein–Protein). These mutations are located within or near the common motif involved in PLP transfer, underscoring the importance of these interactions for TAT function (Aleshin2023Protein–Protein). The interactions between TAT and its partners are crucial for maintaining its activity and stability, influencing metabolic pathways in which TAT is involved.
