# DNM2

## Overview
The DNM2 gene encodes the protein dynamin 2, a large GTPase enzyme that is integral to various cellular processes, particularly those involving membrane dynamics and cytoskeletal organization. Dynamin 2 is categorized as a GTPase due to its role in hydrolyzing GTP to GDP, which is crucial for its function in membrane fission and endocytosis. The protein is involved in the scission of clathrin-coated vesicles from the plasma membrane, as well as in clathrin-independent endocytosis pathways, such as phagocytosis and caveolae formation. Beyond its role in membrane trafficking, dynamin 2 is also implicated in the regulation of the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons, influencing cell migration, mitosis, and apoptosis. Mutations in the DNM2 gene are linked to neuromuscular disorders, including centronuclear myopathy and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, highlighting its clinical significance (Durieux2010Dynamin; Bitoun2005Mutations).

## Structure
Dynamin 2 (DNM2) is a large GTPase with a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. The primary structure of DNM2 consists of an N-terminal GTPase domain responsible for GTP binding and hydrolysis, a middle domain that facilitates self-assembly, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that interacts with membrane phosphoinositides, a GTPase effector domain (GED) that acts as a GTPase-activating protein, and a C-terminal proline-rich domain (PRD) containing Src homology 3 (SH3) binding motifs (Durieux2010Dynamin; Briñas2013Role).

The secondary structure of DNM2 features alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its ability to form complex tertiary structures. The middle domain and GED form an antiparallel four-helix bundle known as the 'stalk', which is crucial for self-assembly (Tassin2021GainofFunction). The quaternary structure of DNM2 involves its ability to form tetramers or higher-order oligomers, which is essential for its function in membrane fission and endocytosis (GómezOca2022Differential).

DNM2 undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which regulate its activity (Briñas2013Role). The protein also has splice variant isoforms, including a muscle-specific isoform that includes exon 12b, which affects its function and localization (GómezOca2022Differential).

## Function
Dynamin 2 (DNM2) is a large GTPase enzyme that plays a critical role in various cellular processes, particularly in membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal organization. It is involved in endocytosis, where it facilitates the formation and scission of clathrin-coated vesicles from the plasma membrane, a process essential for internalizing molecules into the cell (Tassin2021GainofFunction; Durieux2010Dynamin). DNM2 also participates in clathrin-independent endocytosis, such as the formation of phagosomes and caveolae, and is crucial for the secretory pathway, particularly in vesicle formation from the trans-Golgi network and endosomal recycling (Durieux2010Dynamin).

In addition to its role in membrane dynamics, DNM2 is involved in the regulation of the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons, which supports its involvement in cell migration, mitosis, and cell cycle progression (Trochet2021A; Durieux2010Dynamin). It interacts with actin-binding proteins and is present in structures like cortical ruffles and lamellipodia, which are important for cell movement (Durieux2010Dynamin). DNM2 also plays a role in apoptosis through a p53-dependent mechanism and facilitates the transport of the Fas receptor, which is involved in apoptosis signaling (Durieux2010Dynamin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DNM2 gene are associated with several neuromuscular disorders, most notably centronuclear myopathy (CNM) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT). CNM is characterized by muscle weakness and the abnormal centralization of nuclei in muscle fibers. It can present in various forms, ranging from severe neonatal to milder adult-onset types. Histopathological features include nuclear centralization and type 1 fiber predominance (Bitoun2023La; Bitoun2005Mutations). Mutations in DNM2 are thought to cause CNM through a gain-of-function mechanism, leading to increased GTPase activity and aberrant oligomerization (Bitoun2023La).

In addition to CNM, DNM2 mutations are linked to CMT, a peripheral neuropathy characterized by distal muscle weakness and sensory impairment. CMT associated with DNM2 mutations can present as either an intermediate form, with motor nerve conduction velocities between 25 m/s and 38 m/s, or an axonal form, with velocities above 38 m/s (Bitoun2008A). These mutations may disrupt the microtubule cytoskeleton, affecting axonal transport and protein trafficking (Durieux2010Dynamin).

Therapeutic approaches for conditions linked to DNM2 mutations are being explored, including the use of antisense oligonucleotides to modulate DNM2 expression, which has shown promise in preclinical models (Muñoz2020Physiological; Tasfaout2017Antisense).
