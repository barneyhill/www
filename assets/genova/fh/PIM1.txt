# PIM1

## Overview
PIM1 is a gene that encodes the Pim-1 proto-oncogene, a serine/threonine kinase involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, differentiation, and survival. The Pim-1 kinase is characterized by its constitutive activity, as it does not require phosphorylation for activation, and it plays a significant role in mitotic spindle formation and stabilization by interacting with proteins such as the nuclear mitotic apparatus (NuMA) protein. The kinase is also involved in regulating energy metabolism and cell growth through pathways like AMPK and mTORC1. PIM1's overexpression is associated with several cancers, including prostate cancer and hematologic malignancies, where it contributes to tumorigenicity and poor prognosis. Due to its involvement in oncogenic processes, PIM1 is considered a potential target for cancer therapy (Bhattacharya2002Pim1; Beharry2010The; Magnuson2010Why).

## Structure
The PIM1 gene encodes a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in cell survival and proliferation. The primary structure of PIM1 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the protein, with two isoforms of 34 kDa and 44 kDa produced through alternative initiation sites (Narlik‐Grassow2013The). The secondary structure of PIM1 includes an N-terminal domain composed mainly of β-strands and a C-terminal domain consisting of α-helices, connected by a hinge region (Jacobs2005Pim1; Zhukova2011Pim). 

The tertiary structure of PIM1 is characterized by a typical two-lobe kinase fold, with a long, deep ATP binding pocket surrounded by a glycine-rich loop, catalytic loop, and activation loop (Jacobs2005Pim1; Ogawa2012Insights). PIM1 lacks a regulatory domain and remains constitutively active without requiring phosphorylation of the activation loop (Ogawa2012Insights). 

Post-translational modifications of PIM1 include phosphorylation at several sites, such as Ser 261, and SUMOylation at K169, which influences its stability and activity (Jacobs2005Pim1; Iyer2017A). PIM1 functions as a monomer, lacking a quaternary structure (Zhukova2011Pim).

## Function
The PIM1 gene encodes a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, differentiation, and survival. In healthy human cells, PIM1 is involved in the dynamic redistribution during the cell cycle, particularly during mitosis. It moves from the nucleus and cytoplasm in interphase to the spindle poles during mitosis, where it interacts with the nuclear mitotic apparatus (NuMA) protein. This interaction is essential for mitotic spindle formation, as PIM1 phosphorylates NuMA, facilitating its solubilization and association with microtubules, which is crucial for proper mitotic progression (Bhattacharya2002Pim1).

PIM1 also forms complexes with proteins such as dynein, dynactin, and heterochromatin-associated protein 1β (HP1β), which are important for mitosis. These interactions suggest that PIM1 plays a role in the structural organization and stabilization of the mitotic spindle, ensuring accurate chromosome segregation (Bhattacharya2002Pim1). Additionally, PIM1 is involved in regulating energy metabolism and cell growth by modulating pathways such as AMPK and mTORC1, influencing protein synthesis and cell proliferation (Beharry2010The). Overall, PIM1's kinase activity is vital for maintaining genomic stability and cell viability during cell division.

## Clinical Significance
The PIM1 gene is implicated in various cancers due to its role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. Overexpression of PIM1 is associated with poor prognosis in several malignancies, including prostate cancer, where it is linked to aggressive tumor subtypes and hormone insensitivity (Shah2008Potential; Magnuson2010Why). In hematologic malignancies, PIM1 is overexpressed in myeloid and lymphoid leukemias, contributing to the anti-apoptotic properties of oncogenic tyrosine kinases like BCR/ABL and FLT3-ITD (Brault2010PIM). 

PIM1 mutations, such as Pro311Thr and Cys17Tyr, have been identified in Diamond Blackfan anemia, although their functional consequences are not fully understood (Brault2010PIM). In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, PIM1 is involved in somatic hypermutation, leading to genetic alterations that may affect its activity (Bellon2023Targeting). 

PIM1's interaction with the c-MYC oncogene enhances tumorigenicity, particularly in prostate cancer, by stabilizing c-MYC and increasing its transcriptional activity (Magnuson2010Why). These interactions and expression changes highlight PIM1 as a potential target for therapeutic interventions in cancer (Narlik‐Grassow2013The).

## Interactions
PIM1, a serine/threonine kinase, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It phosphorylates the androgen receptor (AR) and the co-activator 14-3-3 ζ, enhancing AR's transcriptional activity in prostate cancer. This interaction is crucial for chromatin occupancy and gene transcription regulation (Ruff2021PIM1). PIM1 also interacts with co-factors such as hnRNPK and TRIM28, which are involved in PIM1-dependent gene expression, influencing genes like MMP7 and TLL2 (Ruff2021PIM1).

In mitosis, PIM1 localizes to spindle poles and interacts with the nuclear mitotic apparatus (NuMA) protein, dynein, and dynactin, which are essential for spindle formation and stabilization (Bhattacharya2002Pim1). PIM1 phosphorylates NuMA, facilitating its role in mitotic spindle organization (Bhattacharya2002Pim1).

PIM1 also interacts with the vitamin D receptor (VDR), enhancing VDR-mediated transcriptional responses independently of calcitriol. This interaction involves the DNA-binding domain of VDR and is significant for calcitriol signaling in keratinocytes (Maier2012PIM1). These interactions highlight PIM1's role in regulating diverse cellular functions through its kinase activity.
