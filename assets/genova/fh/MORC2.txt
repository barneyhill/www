# MORC2

## Overview
MORC2 (MORC family CW-type zinc finger 2) is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in chromatin remodeling, DNA repair, and epigenetic regulation. The protein, categorized as a chromatin remodeler, plays a pivotal role in maintaining genomic stability and regulating gene expression through its involvement in the Human Silencing Hub (HUSH) complex. MORC2 contains several functional domains, including a GHKL-type ATPase module and a CW-type zinc finger domain, which are essential for its ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activities. These activities are crucial for the protein's role in epigenetic silencing and the DNA damage response (Tchasovnikarova2017Hyperactivation; Li2012MORC2). Mutations in the MORC2 gene have been linked to various clinical conditions, including Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2Z and certain neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its significance in human health and disease (Sancho2019Characterization; Guillen2020De). Additionally, MORC2 is implicated in cancer progression, where it influences tumorigenicity and metastasis through its interactions with other proteins and pathways (Wang2018Epigenetic; Guddeti2021MORC2).

## Structure
MORC2 is a protein characterized by several distinct structural domains that contribute to its function in chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. The protein contains an N-terminal GHKL-type ATPase module, which is crucial for its ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activities (Zhang2019MORC2; Li2012MORC2). This module includes gyrase, Hsp90, histidine kinase, and MutL (GHKL) and S5-fold domains, which are involved in gene transcription and DNA repair (Zhang2019MORC2).

MORC2 also features a central CW-type zinc finger (CW-ZF) domain, which acts as a histone methylation reader and is involved in DNA binding and protein-protein interactions (Zhang2019MORC2; Xie2019Dimerization). The C-terminal region of MORC2 includes a chromo-like domain that recognizes methylated peptides in histones and non-histone proteins (Xie2019Dimerization).

The protein's quaternary structure is defined by its ability to form homodimers through its C-terminal coiled-coil domain, a process essential for its role in DNA repair and chromatin dynamics (Xie2019Dimerization). Dimerization is enhanced in response to DNA damage, facilitating the recruitment of DNA repair proteins (Xie2019Dimerization).

MORC2 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation by p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) on serine 739, which regulates its ATPase activity (Li2012MORC2). Additionally, MORC2 is PARylated by PARP1, enhancing its chromatin remodeling activities (Zhang2019MORC2).

## Function
The MORC2 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in chromatin remodeling and epigenetic silencing in healthy human cells. MORC2 functions as an effector of the Human Silencing Hub (HUSH) complex, which is responsible for silencing transposable elements and other genomic loci. It is involved in maintaining chromatin compaction and transcriptional repression, particularly at loci marked by the repressive histone mark H3K9me3 (Tchasovnikarova2017Hyperactivation).

MORC2 contains several functional domains, including a GHKL-type ATPase module and a CW-type zinc finger domain, which are essential for its ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activity. This activity is crucial for the protein's role in epigenetic silencing and the DNA damage response (Douse2018Neuropathic; Li2012MORC2). The protein's ATPase activity facilitates its dimerization and DNA binding, processes that are vital for its function in HUSH-mediated silencing (Douse2018Neuropathic).

MORC2 is also involved in the DNA damage response, where it aids in chromatin relaxation and DNA repair, contributing to genomic stability. This function is regulated by phosphorylation, which enhances its ability to mobilize nucleosomes and facilitate repair processes (Li2012MORC2). Overall, MORC2's activities in chromatin dynamics and gene regulation are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and genomic integrity.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MORC2 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, most notably Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2Z (CMT2Z), a hereditary neuropathy characterized by axonal degeneration. This condition presents with symptoms such as spinal muscular atrophy, distal and proximal muscle weakness, sensory loss, and cerebellar atrophy. The most common mutation linked to CMT2Z is p.R252W, which accounts for over 50% of cases (Sancho2019Characterization; Sevilla2015Mutations). 

MORC2 mutations also contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders, with affected individuals exhibiting developmental delay, intellectual disability, and growth retardation. These disorders are linked to hyperactivation of epigenetic silencing by the HUSH complex (Guillen2020De).

In cancer, MORC2 is implicated in the progression of various types, including hepatocellular carcinoma and gastric cancer. Its overexpression is associated with poor differentiation, larger tumor size, and advanced disease stages. MORC2 acts as an upstream suppressor of the Hippo signaling pathway, promoting cancer stemness and tumorigenicity by repressing tumor suppressor genes (Wang2018Epigenetic; Liu2019MORC2). The gene's role in chromatin remodeling and DNA repair further contributes to its oncogenic potential (Chutani2023Novel).

## Interactions
MORC2 interacts with a variety of proteins, playing significant roles in cellular processes such as chromatin remodeling, gene expression regulation, and cancer progression. It is a component of the HUSH complex, where its ATPase activity is crucial for silencing newly integrated retroviruses and maintaining chromatin architecture (Tchasovnikarova2017Hyperactivation). MORC2 interacts with histone deacetylases HDAC4 and HDAC1, DNMT3A, EZH2, HSF1, and SIRT1, which are involved in modulating gene expression and promoting tumorigenesis (Guddeti2021MORC2).

In cancer, MORC2 interacts with CTNND1, a protein involved in cytoskeleton regulation, to promote breast cancer cell migration and invasion. This interaction is dependent on the PRD domain of MORC2 (Liao2017Chromatin). MORC2 also binds to PAK1 kinase, which phosphorylates MORC2 at serine 739, a modification important for the DNA damage response (Li2012MORC2).

MORC2 is PARylated by PARP1, with the interaction occurring through the BRCT motif of PARP1. This modification is essential for MORC2's role in the DNA damage response (Zhang2019MORC2). These interactions highlight MORC2's involvement in various cellular pathways, particularly those related to chromatin dynamics and cancer.
