# SOD2

## Overview
The SOD2 gene encodes the enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), a critical mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme that plays a pivotal role in cellular defense against oxidative stress. MnSOD is categorized as an oxidoreductase and is responsible for catalyzing the conversion of superoxide radicals, which are byproducts of mitochondrial respiration, into less harmful molecules such as hydrogen peroxide and oxygen. This enzymatic activity is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and protecting against oxidative damage, which can lead to various pathological conditions. The SOD2 gene is expressed in numerous tissues and is tightly regulated to ensure proper cellular function and survival. Alterations in SOD2 expression or function have been implicated in a range of diseases, including cardiomyopathy, neurodegeneration, and cancer, underscoring its significance in human health (Almomani2019Homozygous; Zelko2002Superoxide; Holley2010Manganese).

## Structure
The SOD2 gene encodes the manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a crucial role in protecting cells from oxidative damage by catalyzing the conversion of superoxide radicals into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. The protein is a homotetramer, with each subunit containing a manganese ion essential for its catalytic activity (Perry2010The; Zelko2002Superoxide).

The primary structure of SOD2 includes a leader peptide that targets the enzyme to the mitochondria, where it is processed into its mature form (Zelko2002Superoxide). The secondary structure of MnSOD is characterized by alpha helices and beta sheets, forming a stable tertiary structure that supports its enzymatic function (Azadmanesh2024Revealing).

In terms of quaternary structure, MnSOD assembles into a tetramer, forming a dimer of dimers with symmetrical four-helix bundles. The active site is located between the N-terminal helices and the C-terminal α/β domain, with a single metal ion coordinated in a trigonal bipyramidal geometry by specific amino acid side chains and a solvent molecule (Perry2010The).

Post-translational modifications such as acetylation and phosphorylation can regulate the activity of MnSOD, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context (Azadmanesh2024Revealing).

## Function
SOD2, also known as manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), is a critical mitochondrial enzyme that plays a vital role in protecting cells from oxidative stress. It catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide radicals, which are primarily generated by the electron transport chain in mitochondria, into hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen. This enzymatic activity is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing oxidative damage to cellular components (Zelko2002Superoxide; Holley2010Manganese).

In healthy human cells, SOD2 helps regulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, which are important mediators in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, immune response, apoptosis, and cell growth (Holley2010Manganese). The enzyme's activity is crucial for the survival of aerobic life, as it mitigates the toxic effects of oxygen and supports cellular differentiation and tumor suppression (Zelko2002Superoxide; Holley2010Manganese).

SOD2 is expressed in many cell types and tissues, with its expression being tightly regulated by various intracellular and environmental factors. This regulation underscores its importance in maintaining cellular health and protecting against oxidative stress (Zelko2002Superoxide). The enzyme's role extends to influencing transcription factor activity and DNA stability, which are significant in cancer development and progression (Holley2010Manganese).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the SOD2 gene are linked to several diseases due to increased oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. A homozygous damaging variant in SOD2, specifically the c.542G>T variant, results in a Gly181Val substitution and is associated with lethal neonatal dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). This variant causes a conformational change in the protein, affecting its folding and interaction with other molecules, leading to reduced enzymatic activity and increased oxidative stress in patient-derived cells (Almomani2019Homozygous).

SOD2 deficiency in hematopoietic stem cells results in a persistent hemolytic anemia with similarities to sideroblastic anemia, characterized by increased oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction (Friedman2004SOD2-deficiency). In mice, SOD2 deficiency leads to severe anemia, neurodegeneration, and myocardial injury, highlighting its critical role in protecting against oxidative damage in metabolically active tissues (Lebovitz1996Neurodegeneration).

In cancer, variations in SOD2, such as the Ala16Val polymorphism, affect mitochondrial import and are linked to increased risk of certain cancers, including pancreatic and non-small-cell lung carcinoma. Altered SOD2 expression can contribute to cancer development and progression by affecting cellular redox balance and resistance to apoptosis (Xu2008Mutations; Kim2017Insights).

## Interactions
SOD2 (superoxide dismutase 2) interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It is involved in the mitochondrial import process, facilitated by the molecular chaperone Hsp70. Hsp70 binds to SOD2, preventing its aggregation and aiding its import into mitochondria. This interaction is regulated by the phosphorylation of Hsp70 by Akt1, which reduces its binding affinity to CHIP, an E3 ligase that targets SOD2 for degradation, thereby enhancing SOD2 stability and import (Zemanovic2018Dynamic).

SOD2 also interacts with USP36, a deubiquitinating enzyme that stabilizes SOD2 by reducing its polyubiquitination and preventing its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway. This interaction increases the half-life of SOD2, highlighting USP36's role in regulating SOD2 stability and function (Kim2011Protein).

In the context of mRNA interactions, SOD2 mRNA is associated with proteins like IGF2BP2, LRRC40, and GPATCH8, which are involved in mRNA transport, translation, and splicing. These interactions suggest a role for SOD2 mRNA in mRNA localization and mitochondrial function (wust2021protein).
