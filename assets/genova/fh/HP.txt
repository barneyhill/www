# HP

## Overview
The HP gene encodes the protein haptoglobin, a plasma glycoprotein primarily involved in binding free hemoglobin released from erythrocytes, thereby preventing oxidative damage and facilitating its clearance from the bloodstream. Haptoglobin is categorized as a glycoprotein with a tetrameric structure composed of two alpha and two beta chains, linked by disulfide bonds. This protein plays a crucial role in antioxidant defense, inflammation modulation, and immune response regulation. The HP gene exhibits polymorphisms that result in different haptoglobin phenotypes, such as Hp1-1, Hp2-1, and Hp2-2, which influence its functional properties and are associated with varying susceptibilities to diseases, including cardiovascular and infectious diseases (Schaer2014Haptoglobin; Napolioni2011Haptoglobin; Carew2020Haptoglobin).

## Structure
Haptoglobin (HP) is a tetrameric plasma glycoprotein composed of two alpha (α) and two beta (β) chains linked by disulfide bonds (Naryzny2021Haptoglobin; Wobeto2008Polymorphism). The primary structure includes a signal peptide and a propeptide, with the α and β chains encoded by the Hp gene in tandem form, resulting in the synthesis of a full-length precursor, prehaptoglobin (Pre-Hp) (Naryzny2021Haptoglobin). The α-chain contains the complement control protein (CCP) domain, while the β-chain contains a catalytically inactive chymotrypsin-like serine proteinase (SP) domain (Naryzny2021Haptoglobin).

The secondary structure of haptoglobin features alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stability and function. The tertiary structure involves a serine protease-like domain, which is homologous to serine proteinases like chymotrypsin and trypsin (Giblett1974Haptoglobin). The quaternary structure forms a tetramer, with the α and β chains forming αβ-dimers that further assemble into tetramers (Naryzny2021Haptoglobin).

Haptoglobin undergoes several post-translational modifications, including glycosylation at four Asn sites on the β-chain, which is significant for its structure and function (Naryzny2021Haptoglobin). The protein also exhibits polymorphism, resulting in different isoforms such as Hp1-1, Hp2-1, and Hp2-2, which differ in their polymeric structures (Naryzny2021Haptoglobin; Wobeto2008Polymorphism).

## Function
The HP gene encodes haptoglobin, a protein with several critical functions in human cells. Haptoglobin primarily acts as a potent antioxidant by binding free hemoglobin released from lysed erythrocytes, preventing oxidative damage to lipids and proteins (Napolioni2011Haptoglobin; Carew2020Haptoglobin). This binding forms a haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex, which is cleared from the bloodstream by the macrophage scavenging receptor CD163, thus protecting tissues from oxidative stress and maintaining nitrous oxide homeostasis (Hardwick2013Haptoglobin).

Haptoglobin also plays a role in modulating inflammation and immune responses. It is expressed in various tissues and can migrate through vessel walls in response to stimuli, being released at sites of injury or inflammation to mitigate tissue damage (Napolioni2011Haptoglobin). The protein interacts with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) to promote reverse cholesterol efflux, contributing to cholesterol metabolism and cardiovascular health (Carew2020Haptoglobin).

The HP gene exhibits polymorphisms, resulting in different genotypes that influence its antioxidant and immune-regulatory properties, affecting susceptibility to various diseases (Napolioni2011Haptoglobin). These polymorphisms also impact cholesterol levels, with the HP2 allele being associated with increased cholesterol levels (Boettger2016Recurring).

## Clinical Significance
The haptoglobin (HP) gene is associated with various diseases due to its polymorphisms, which result in different phenotypes: Hp1-1, Hp2-1, and Hp2-2. These phenotypes influence susceptibility to several conditions. The Hp2-2 phenotype is linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, particularly in diabetic patients, due to higher tissue iron accumulation and oxidative damage (Schaer2014Haptoglobin). In diabetes mellitus, the Hp2-2 phenotype is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular complications and microvascular issues (Wobeto2008Polymorphism). 

In infectious diseases, the Hp2-2 phenotype is associated with higher mortality in tuberculosis and HIV patients, while the Hp1-1 phenotype is more common in hepatitis C and malaria cases (Wobeto2008Polymorphism). The Hp2-1 genotype is linked to refractory hypertension in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, indicating a higher risk of developing this condition (Wobeto2011Genótipos). 

In celiac disease, the Hp2-1 phenotype is associated with an increased risk and is prevalent among patients with mild or silent symptoms, whereas the Hp2-2 phenotype is linked to severe malabsorption (Papp2008Haptoglobin). These associations highlight the clinical significance of HP polymorphisms in disease susceptibility and progression.

## Interactions
Haptoglobin (HP) is a plasma glycoprotein that primarily interacts with free hemoglobin (Hb) released during the lysis of erythrocytes. This interaction forms a stable haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex, which is crucial for preventing oxidative damage and renal injury by facilitating the clearance of hemoglobin from the bloodstream (Wobeto2008Polymorphism; Rodrigues2019Haptoglobin). The haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex is recognized and endocytosed by the CD163 receptor on macrophages, a process that is calcium-dependent and exhibits high affinity (Kristiansen2001Identification). This interaction is specific to the haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex, as neither haptoglobin nor hemoglobin alone binds to CD163 (Kristiansen2001Identification).

Haptoglobin also interacts with the integrin receptor CD11b/CD18, which is primarily expressed on monocytes and is involved in inflammation and phagocytosis (Cox2007Haplotype). The different phenotypes of haptoglobin, such as Hp1-1 and Hp2-2, exhibit varying efficiencies in these interactions, influencing their protective roles against oxidative stress and inflammation (Wobeto2008Polymorphism; Rodrigues2019Haptoglobin). Haptoglobin does not interact with nucleic acids (Kristiansen2001Identification).
