# ZFAT

## Overview
ZFAT is a gene that encodes the zinc finger and AT-hook domain containing protein, which is a transcriptional regulator involved in various cellular processes. The protein is characterized by its zinc-finger and AT-hook domains, which facilitate DNA binding and transcriptional regulation, categorizing it as a nuclear transcription factor. ZFAT plays a crucial role in T-cell development and homeostasis, influencing immune tolerance and reactivity through the regulation of T-cell receptor signaling and gene expression (Ogawa2013ZfatDeficiency). Beyond its immunological functions, ZFAT is implicated in chromatin regulation and adipocyte differentiation, highlighting its broader significance in cellular and organismal functions (Ishikura2021The). The gene's clinical relevance is underscored by its association with autoimmune diseases, particularly autoimmune thyroid diseases, where specific single nucleotide polymorphisms in ZFAT have been identified as risk factors (Shirasawa2004SNPs).

## Structure
The ZFAT protein is characterized by its zinc-finger and AT-hook domains, playing a crucial role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. It contains 18 C2H2-type zinc-finger domains and one AT-hook motif, which are essential for its function as a transcriptional regulator (Ishikura2016Molecular; Tochio2015Solution). The zinc-finger domains typically consist of a short antiparallel beta-sheet and a helix, which are common structural features of C2H2 zinc-fingers (Tochio2015Solution). 

The ZFAT protein includes both canonical zinc-finger structures and unique bulged-out helix-containing zinc-fingers. These bulged-out helices have a four-residue spacing between histidines, resulting in a larger and looser helical structure compared to canonical helices, allowing for specific hydrogen bonding with DNA bases (Tochio2015Solution). The protein's zinc-finger domains exhibit structural variations, such as a longer spacer in ZF11, which influences DNA-binding activity (Tochio2015Solution).

ZFAT is involved in chromatin regulation, as evidenced by its association with histone modifications like H3K9ac and H3K27ac, which are linked to active chromatin states (Ishikura2016Molecular). The protein's structure and interactions suggest its role in regulating gene expression by binding to transcription start sites and influencing chromatin modifications (Ishikura2016Molecular).

## Function
The ZFAT gene encodes a nuclear protein characterized by zinc-finger and AT-hook domains, which are crucial for transcriptional regulation in T cells. ZFAT is involved in maintaining T-cell homeostasis and is essential for T-cell development and survival. It plays a significant role in the positive selection of T cells, a process necessary for immune tolerance and reactivity, by regulating T-cell receptor (TCR)-proximal signaling and the expression of genes like Egr1 and Egr2 (Ogawa2013ZfatDeficiency).

ZFAT directly binds to conserved DNA sequences around transcription start sites, influencing the transcription of target genes such as Arl1, Brpf1, and Nhlrc2, which are important for T-cell function (Ishikura2016Molecular). It also regulates histone acetylation, maintaining active chromatin states necessary for gene expression (Ishikura2016Molecular).

In peripheral T cells, ZFAT is crucial for maintaining FoxO1 protein levels by regulating autophagy and the Akt signaling pathway, which are important for T-cell quiescence and differentiation (Ishikura2016The). ZFAT's role extends beyond T cells, as it is also involved in adipocyte differentiation and energy homeostasis, highlighting its broader significance in cellular and organismal functions (Ishikura2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ZFAT gene have been linked to several autoimmune diseases, particularly autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITD) such as Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. The gene is associated with susceptibility to these conditions due to its role in immune system regulation. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the ZFAT gene, such as Ex9b-SNP10, have been identified as significant risk factors for AITD. The T allele of Ex9b-SNP10 is notably associated with an increased risk of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, suggesting a stronger susceptibility to this condition compared to Graves' disease (Shirasawa2004SNPs).

The expression of ZFAT and its related transcripts, TR-ZFAT and SAS-ZFAT, is influenced by these SNPs, which can affect transcriptional regulation and gene expression levels. For instance, the Ex9b-SNP10-T allele is linked to the repression of SAS-ZFAT expression, which in turn affects TR-ZFAT expression, potentially contributing to the etiology of AITD (Shirasawa2004SNPs). Additionally, ZFAT is involved in apoptosis regulation, with its knockdown leading to increased apoptosis in certain cell types, indicating its critical role in cell survival and immune responses (Doi2011ZFAT). These findings underscore the clinical significance of ZFAT in autoimmune and potentially other immune-related disorders.

## Interactions
The ZFAT protein is involved in several key interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in transcriptional regulation. ZFAT recruits the histone acetyltransferase KAT2B to centromeres, facilitating the acetylation of histone H4 at lysine 8 (H4K8ac). This modification is essential for the transcription of noncoding RNA (ncRNA) at centromeres (Ishikura2020ZFAT). The interaction between ZFAT and KAT2B is mediated by the C-terminal region of ZFAT, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation analysis (Ishikura2020ZFAT).

ZFAT also interacts with BRD4, a bromodomain-containing protein, which is recruited to centromeres through KAT2B-mediated H4K8ac. This interaction is crucial for RNA polymerase II-dependent ncRNA transcription (Ishikura2020ZFAT). The recruitment of BRD4 is dependent on its bromodomains, as deletion of these domains or inhibition with JQ1 prevents BRD4 localization to centromeres (Ishikura2020ZFAT).

ZFAT binds to specific DNA sequences, known as the ZFAT box, which are conserved across centromeres on all chromosomes. This binding is crucial for its role in centromeric transcription regulation (Ishikura2020ZFAT). These interactions highlight ZFAT's role in modulating chromatin structure and gene expression.
