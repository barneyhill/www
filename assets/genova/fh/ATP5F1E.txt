# ATP5F1E

## Overview
ATP5F1E is a gene that encodes the epsilon subunit of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex, specifically the F1FO ATP synthase. This enzyme complex is pivotal in cellular energy production, facilitating the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through oxidative phosphorylation within the inner mitochondrial membrane. The protein product of ATP5F1E, the ATP synthase F1 subunit epsilon, is integral to the structural stability and functional efficiency of the ATP synthase complex. It is involved in the formation of the central stalk, which is essential for the mechanical coupling of proton translocation to ATP synthesis. Variations in the ATP5F1E gene can lead to mitochondrial dysfunctions, manifesting in a spectrum of clinical disorders due to impaired ATP production (Fernandez‐Vizarra2020Mitochondrial; Tauchmannová2024Variability; Patel2020Natural).

## Function
ATP5F1E encodes the epsilon subunit of the F1FO ATP synthase, a critical enzyme complex involved in cellular energy production through oxidative phosphorylation. This enzyme is primarily located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it synthesizes ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate, a process essential for maintaining cellular energy homeostasis (Fernandez‐Vizarra2020Mitochondrial; Patel2020Natural).

The F1FO ATP synthase consists of two main regions: the F1 domain, which includes the catalytic head and central stalk, and the FO domain, which contains the rotor and peripheral stalk. The epsilon subunit, encoded by ATP5F1E, is part of the F1 domain and plays a crucial role in stabilizing the enzyme's structure. It supports the rotation of the c-ring, driven by proton movement, which imparts torque on the F1 central stalk. This rotation leads to conformational changes in the catalytic head, necessary for ATP synthesis (Patel2020Natural).

In healthy human cells, ATP5F1E is vital for the proper assembly and function of ATP synthase, ensuring efficient ATP production. This is crucial for various cellular processes, including metabolism, cell differentiation, and survival (Fernandez‐Vizarra2020Mitochondrial).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATP5F1E gene, which encodes the ε subunit of ATP synthase, are associated with a range of mitochondrial disorders. A notable mutation, c.35A>G (p.Tyr12Cys), has been linked to early-onset lactic acidosis, 3-methylglutaconic aciduria, mild mental retardation, exercise intolerance, ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, and dystonia. This mutation results in a significant reduction in ATP synthase activity and complex V levels, as well as a decrease in the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) (Tauchmannová2024Variability).

The clinical manifestations of ATP5F1E mutations can vary significantly, even among patients with the same genetic variant. Some patients experience severe symptoms such as seizures, respiratory distress, and developmental delays, while others may have milder forms of the disease (Tauchmannová2024Variability). Despite the reduction in ATP synthase content and activity, the residual enzyme with the mutated ε subunit can retain normal activity, indicating that the mutation primarily affects enzyme assembly rather than function (Franco2020Human).

These mutations highlight the critical role of ATP5F1E in maintaining mitochondrial function and underscore the potential for species-specific impacts due to differences in physical interactions with other components of the ATP synthase complex (Franco2020Human).

## Interactions
ATP5F1E, also known as the ATP synthase F1 subunit epsilon, is a component of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex. This complex is essential for ATP production, and ATP5F1E plays a role in the assembly and stability of the ATP synthase complex. It interacts with other subunits within the complex, such as ATP5F1A, ATP5F1B, and ATP5F1C, to facilitate the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Tauchmannová2024Variability).

The ATP5F1E subunit is involved in forming the central stalk of the ATP synthase complex, which is crucial for stabilizing the connection between the γ subunit and the c ring, thereby maintaining the stability of the entire complex (Tauchmannová2024Variability). Pathogenic variants in ATP5F1E can lead to a reduction in the amount of the ε subunit, although the remaining subunit can still be assembled into the ATP synthase complex without affecting its stability (Tauchmannová2024Variability).

In addition to its role in the ATP synthase complex, ATP5F1E has been implicated in interactions with other proteins. For instance, in autoimmune-related kidney diseases, there is a correlation between the expression of ATP5F1E and SERPINA1, suggesting potential interactions in mitochondrial dysfunction (Xiao2024Proteomic). However, specific physical interactions with nucleic acids have not been detailed in the available literature.
