# KRTAP19-3

## Overview
KRTAP19-3 is a gene that encodes the keratin associated protein 19-3, which is a member of the keratin-associated protein (KAP) family. These proteins are integral components of the hair and nail structure, playing a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of the keratin matrix. The KAP family is known for its involvement in the structural integrity and mechanical properties of keratinized tissues. The keratin associated protein 19-3, specifically, contributes to the complex network of interactions that stabilize the hair shaft and other keratin-rich structures. Variations in the KRTAP19-3 gene have been studied for their potential impact on hair texture and strength, as well as their implications in certain dermatological conditions.
