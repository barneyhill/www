# AMN

## Overview
The AMN gene encodes the amnionless protein, a type 1 transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the cubam receptor complex, which is essential for vitamin B12 uptake and protein reabsorption in the kidneys. The amnionless protein is characterized by its structural components, including an extracellular domain, a transmembrane helix, and a short cytoplasmic domain, which facilitate its interaction with cubilin, another component of the cubam complex (Storm2013Detailed; Larsen2018Structural). This interaction is crucial for the proper functioning of the receptor complex, enabling the endocytosis of the intrinsic factor-cobalamin complex in the intestine and the reabsorption of various proteins in the kidneys (Christensen2013From; Huemer2019The). Mutations in the AMN gene can lead to conditions such as Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome, underscoring the gene's clinical significance in maintaining vitamin B12 homeostasis (Tanner2005Hereditary).

## Structure
The AMN protein, encoded by the AMN gene, is a crucial component of the cubam receptor complex involved in vitamin B12 uptake and protein reabsorption in the kidneys. Structurally, AMN is a type 1 transmembrane protein composed of an extracellular domain, a transmembrane helix, and a short cytoplasmic domain (Storm2013Detailed; Larsen2018Structural). The extracellular domain includes a SEA domain, a cysteine-rich region, and two N-terminal β-helices. The SEA domain exhibits a classic βαββαβ-fold, while the β-helices are right-handed with hydrophobic cores, forming inverted three-faced pyramids (Larsen2018Structural).

The AMN protein interacts with cubilin through a β-helix-β-helix association, anchoring the ligand-binding cubilin subunits to the transmembrane AMN. This interaction is characterized by a hydrophobic interface and involves Van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonds (Larsen2018Structural). The AMN protein is glycosylated, with potential glycosylation sites at Asn35 and Asn39. Asn35 is buried within β-helix 1, while Asn39 is solvent-exposed, allowing for glycosylation without structural rearrangements (Larsen2018Structural). Mutations in AMN, such as T41I, can alter glycosylation patterns, affecting the expression and function of the cubam receptor complex (Larsen2018Structural).

## Function
The AMN gene encodes the amnionless protein, a crucial component of the cubam receptor complex, which also includes cubilin. This complex is essential for the absorption of vitamin B12 (cobalamin) in the human body. In the intestine, the cubam receptor facilitates the endocytosis of the intrinsic factor-cobalamin complex into ileal enterocytes, allowing for the intralysosomal salvage of cobalamin from the intrinsic factor (Christensen2013From; Huemer2019The). The AMN protein is a type 1 transmembrane protein that contains signals for receptor-mediated endocytosis through clathrin-coated vesicles, engaging clathrin-associated sorting proteins such as disabled-2 (Dab2) and autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia (ARH) (Storm2013Detailed).

In addition to its role in the intestine, the AMN protein is expressed in the kidneys, where it interacts with cubilin and megalin in the proximal tubules to facilitate the reabsorption of filtered plasma proteins, including albumin, vitamin D-binding protein, apolipoprotein A-I, and transferrin (Christensen2013From; Storm2013Detailed). The AMN protein may also play a role in the transport of cobalamin across the blood-brain barrier, contributing to the maintenance of normal cobalamin levels in the central nervous system (Luder2008Amnionless).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AMN gene are associated with Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome (IGS), a rare hereditary condition characterized by vitamin B12 deficiency, megaloblastic anemia, and neurological issues. This syndrome results from the impaired absorption of cobalamin (vitamin B12) due to mutations in either the AMN or cubilin (CUBN) genes, which together form a complex essential for the intestinal absorption and renal tubular reabsorption of the vitamin B12-intrinsic factor complex (Tanner2005Hereditary). IGS is particularly prevalent in Finland and Norway, attributed to genetic founder effects, with Finnish cases linked to CUBN mutations and Norwegian cases to AMN mutations (Tanner2005Hereditary).

The AMN gene's role in vitamin B12 absorption is critical, and its dysfunction can lead to severe clinical outcomes if untreated. The condition is not corrected by the administration of intrinsic factor alone, highlighting the necessity of the AMN protein in the absorption process (Tanner2005Hereditary). Genetic testing and mutational analysis of the AMN gene are crucial for diagnosing juvenile cobalamin deficiency and differentiating it from other similar conditions (Tanner2005Hereditary).

## Interactions
The AMN gene encodes the amnionless protein, which plays a crucial role in forming the cubam receptor complex by interacting with cubilin. This interaction is essential for the cell surface targeting and function of cubilin, a multi-ligand receptor involved in vitamin B12 uptake and protein reabsorption in the kidney and intestine (Udagawa2018Amnionlessmediated; Larsen2018Structural). Amnionless is a transmembrane protein that binds to cubilin, facilitating its proper folding and translocation to the plasma membrane. This interaction is characterized by a β-helix-β-helix association, which is crucial for the structural integrity of the receptor complex (Larsen2018Structural).

Mutations in the AMN gene can disrupt its interaction with cubilin, leading to impaired receptor function and conditions such as Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome (IGS), which is characterized by vitamin B12 deficiency and proteinuria (Storm2013Detailed; Larsen2018Structural). The AMN protein also interacts with megalin, another receptor that stabilizes cubilin at the cell surface, although megalin is not required for the amnionless-dependent membrane targeting of cubilin (Strope2004Mouse; Udagawa2018Amnionlessmediated). These interactions highlight the critical role of amnionless in nutrient absorption and cellular function.
