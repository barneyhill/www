# ZNF614

## Overview
ZNF614 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 614, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are small protein structural motifs that can coordinate one or more zinc ions to help stabilize their folds. Zinc finger proteins are often involved in DNA binding and play critical roles in transcriptional regulation, cellular development, and differentiation. The specific functions of zinc finger protein 614 remain to be fully elucidated, but like other zinc finger proteins, it is likely involved in gene expression regulation. The study of ZNF614 and its encoded protein is ongoing, with research focusing on its potential interactions and implications in various biological pathways and diseases.
