# MYORG

## Overview
The MYORG gene encodes the myogenesis-regulating glycosidase, a type II transmembrane protein that belongs to the glycoside hydrolase family 31 (GH31). This protein is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and functions as an α-galactosidase with a specific role in the hydrolysis of α-galactosides. The enzymatic activity of MYORG is crucial for the processing of glycoproteins, which is significant in the context of primary familial brain calcification (PFBC), a neurodegenerative disorder. Structurally, the protein is characterized by a complex architecture, including an antiparallel β-sandwich N-terminal domain and a (β/α)8-barrel catalytic domain, and it forms a membrane-bound dimer essential for its function (Meek2022The). Mutations in the MYORG gene have been linked to autosomal recessive PFBC, highlighting its clinical significance in neurological health (Grangeon2019Biallelic; Gao2021A).

## Structure
The MYORG protein is a member of the glycoside hydrolase family 31 (GH31) and is characterized by a complex molecular structure. It is a type II transmembrane protein with a short N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a single transmembrane helix, and a long C-terminal luminal fragment that contains the catalytic domain (Meek2022The; Yao2018Biallelic). The protein's primary structure consists of 714 amino acids, with the transmembrane domain located between amino acids 57 and 77, and the glycosyl hydrolase domain spanning amino acids 311 to 714 (Yao2018Biallelic).

The secondary and tertiary structures of MYORG include an antiparallel β-sandwich N-terminal domain, a (β/α)8-barrel catalytic domain, and a proximal β-sheet domain. The protein forms a membrane-bound dimer, supported by a hydrophobic interaction network and hydrogen bonding, with a dimer interface covering 639 Å² (Meek2022The). The structure also features five cysteine residues forming two disulfide bonds within the N-terminal domain (Meek2022The).

MYORG is heavily glycosylated, with six predicted N-glycosylation sites, all of which are observed in the protein's structure (Meek2022The). This glycosylation is crucial for its proper folding and function, as demonstrated by the need for expression in a eukaryotic system to achieve correct glycosylation (Meek2022The). The protein's quaternary structure is a dimer, which is atypical for GH31 enzymes due to the absence of a common distal C-terminal domain usually involved in dimerization (Meek2022The).

## Function
The MYORG gene encodes a protein known as myogenesis-regulating glycosidase, which functions as an α-galactosidase with restricted substrate specificity. This protein is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is involved in the hydrolysis of α-galactosides, specifically cleaving the substrate Gal-α1,4-Glc (Meek2022The). MYORG is a type II transmembrane protein that forms a membrane-bound dimer, with its catalytic domain positioned perpendicular to the membrane (Meek2022The).

The protein's enzymatic activity is crucial for glycoprotein processing within the ER, potentially playing a role in the regulation of protein folding or maturation. This function is particularly relevant to the processing of glycoproteins linked to primary familial brain calcification (PFBC), such as SLC20A2, PDGFB, PDGFRB, and XPR1 (Meek2022The). MYORG's involvement in insulin growth factor II (IGF-II) secretion and its potential interaction with pro-IGF-II, which is O-glycosylated, suggests a role in processing glycoproteins (Meek2022The). The protein's activity is supported by its structural features, including an antiparallel β-sandwich N-terminal domain, a (β/α)8-barrel catalytic domain, and several N-glycosylation sites, which may contribute to its function or stability (Meek2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MYORG gene are associated with autosomal recessive primary familial brain calcification (PFBC), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by bilateral calcifications in the brain, particularly affecting the basal ganglia, thalamus, and cerebellar nuclei. These calcifications can lead to a range of neurological symptoms, including dysarthria, dystonia, ataxia, parkinsonism, tremor, seizures, chronic headache, dysphagia, cognitive impairment, and psychosis (Grangeon2019Biallelic; Gao2021A). 

MYORG mutations, including nonsense, insertion/deletion, and missense mutations, are distributed throughout the gene's coding region and are absent in large genomic databases, indicating their rarity (Bauer2019MYORG; Yao2018Biallelic). Homozygous individuals with MYORG mutations exhibit extensive brain calcification and a range of neurological symptoms, while heterozygous carriers are typically asymptomatic (Bauer2019MYORG). 

The severity of symptoms in individuals with MYORG mutations can vary, with homozygous truncating mutations often leading to more severe phenotypes (Bauer2019MYORG; Yao2018Biallelic). MYORG-related PFBC is distinct from autosomal dominant forms of the disorder, with a propensity for calcification in the posterior fossa and pons (Bauer2019MYORG).

## Interactions
The MYORG protein, also known as myogenesis-regulating glycosidase, is involved in specific protein interactions that are crucial for its function. Structurally, MYORG forms a dimeric assembly, which is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds between specific residues. This dimerization is essential for its enzymatic activity and potential interactions with other molecules (Meek2022The).

MYORG is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plays a role in glycan processing, which is important for the proper folding and maturation of glycoproteins. Its dysfunction can affect the folding or maturation of proteins linked to primary familial brain calcification (PFBC), such as SLC20A2, PDGFB, PDGFRB, and XPR1, all of which are glycoproteins (Meek2022The). MYORG also interacts with pro-IGF-II, a glycoprotein known to be extensively O-glycosylated, suggesting a role in processing α-galactosidic linkages within glycoproteins (Meek2022The).

Mutations in MYORG can lead to changes in protein interactions, specifically the loss of connectivity and stability due to the disappearance of interactions such as salt-bridges and hydrogen bonds (Yao2024A). These interactions are critical for maintaining the structural integrity and function of the protein.
