# YJEFN3

## Overview
YJEFN3 is a gene that encodes the protein YjeF N-terminal domain containing 3, which is involved in various cellular processes. The protein is characterized by the presence of a YjeF N-terminal domain, which is a conserved motif found in a family of proteins with diverse functions, including enzymatic activity and regulatory roles. Although the specific biological functions of YjeF N-terminal domain containing 3 are not fully elucidated, it is implicated in cellular pathways that may influence cell growth and differentiation. The gene and its encoded protein are subjects of ongoing research to better understand their roles in health and disease, particularly in the context of their potential involvement in signaling pathways and cellular homeostasis (Qiu2020aarFDC).
