# CCS

## Overview
The CCS gene encodes the copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase, a specialized protein that plays a critical role in cellular copper homeostasis and the activation of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). This protein is categorized as a chaperone due to its function in facilitating the proper delivery and insertion of copper ions into SOD1, which is essential for the detoxification of superoxide radicals and protection against oxidative stress. The CCS protein is composed of three distinct domains, each contributing to its multifaceted role in copper acquisition, delivery, and insertion. It is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues and is involved in several biological processes, including apoptosis, angiogenesis, and mitochondrial function. The interactions of CCS with other proteins, such as CTR1, ATOX1, and Mia40, underscore its importance in maintaining copper balance and protein maturation within the cell (Kawamata2010Import; Ge2019Exploring).

## Structure
The CCS protein, encoded by the human CCS gene, is a copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase and consists of three domains. Domain I is involved in copper ion uptake and delivery, featuring a conserved MXCXXC sequence motif necessary for Cu,Zn-SOD activation (Fukuhara2013Structure). Domain II resembles Cu,Zn-SOD but does not bind copper ions; it is essential for recognizing the target enzyme, Cu,Zn-SOD (Fukuhara2013Structure). This domain is highly homologous to SOD1, sharing over 50% amino acid identity, and includes a critical residue, Arg163, which forms a salt bridge with Asp185, stabilizing the protein structure (Huppke2012Molecular). Domain III is crucial for inserting copper ions into Cu,Zn-SOD and forming disulfide bonds, with a conserved CXC motif (Fukuhara2013Structure).

The secondary structure of CCS includes beta strands, alpha helices, and loops, with specific residues playing key roles in maintaining structural integrity (Huppke2012Molecular). The quaternary structure involves dimerization, resembling the SOD1 homodimer, and is crucial for the protein's function in copper delivery (Lamb2000Crystal). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and has known splice variants.

## Function
The CCS gene encodes the copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase, a protein essential for the activation of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) by delivering copper ions. This process is crucial for the detoxification of superoxide radicals in cells, protecting against oxidative stress (Kawamata2010Import; Ge2019Exploring). CCS is composed of three domains, each contributing to its function: the N-terminal domain is responsible for copper acquisition, the central domain facilitates copper delivery to SOD1, and the C-terminal domain contains a conserved copper-binding motif critical for CCS function (Ge2019Exploring).

CCS is involved in several biological processes, including copper homeostasis, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and oxidative stress. It interacts with various proteins such as XIAP, Mia40, and X11α, which are implicated in these processes (Ge2019Exploring). CCS is ubiquitously expressed in multiple tissues, including the brain, liver, and kidney, and is primarily located in the cytosol, nucleus, and mitochondrial inner membrane space (Ge2019Exploring). It plays a role in mitochondrial function by stimulating the accumulation of SOD1 in mitochondria (Kawamata2010Import). The protein's stability and function are influenced by its copper and zinc binding capabilities, with zinc binding being crucial for maintaining its structure (Ge2019Exploring).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CCS gene, which encodes the copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase (SOD1), have been implicated in various diseases. A unique mutation, p.Arg163Trp, in the CCS gene has been identified in a patient with severe developmental delay, cataracts, and sensorineural hearing loss. This mutation leads to reduced CCS expression and impaired binding to SOD1, resulting in decreased SOD1 activity and potentially affecting copper homeostasis (Huppke2012Molecular). The mutation disrupts a salt bridge crucial for protein stability, highlighting its pathogenic potential (Huppke2012Molecular).

In the context of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the role of CCS is complex. While CCS is essential for SOD1 maturation, its overexpression can accelerate ALS progression in certain mouse models, suggesting a mutation-specific impact on disease progression (Son2009Redox). However, no direct causative mutations in the CCS gene have been found in sporadic ALS patients, indicating that CCS may not be directly implicated in ALS through mutations in its coding region (Silahtaroglu2002HumanCCSgene:genomicorganizationandexclusionasacandidateforamyotrophiclateralsclerosis(ALS) page 0 of 1). The interaction between CCS and SOD1 is crucial for preventing the formation of aggregation-prone states associated with neurodegenerative diseases (Sala2019Molecular).

## Interactions
The human copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase (CCS) interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in copper homeostasis and the maturation of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). CCS directly interacts with SOD1, forming a transient disulfide bond that facilitates copper insertion into SOD1, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (Kawamata2010Import). CCS also forms a stable complex with zinc-bound SOD1, preventing the accumulation of unstructured mutant SOD1, which is significant in the context of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS) (Luchinat2017A).

CCS interacts with the copper uptake protein CTR1 in a copper-dependent manner, suggesting a secondary pathway for copper acquisition (Ge2019Exploring). It also interacts with ATOX1, another copper-binding protein, facilitating copper exchange between them (Petzoldt2015Human). In the mitochondrial intermembrane space, CCS interacts with the oxidoreductase Mia40, forming disulfide bonds that aid in its import and retention (Kawamata2010Import).

Additionally, CCS binds to MEK1, a kinase in the MAPK signaling pathway, enhancing its activity through copper binding (Grasso2020Structural). These interactions highlight CCS's multifaceted role in copper metabolism and protein maturation.
