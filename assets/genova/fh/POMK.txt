# POMK

## Overview
Protein O-mannose kinase (POMK) is a gene that encodes a type II transmembrane protein kinase involved in the post-translational modification of proteins, specifically through the phosphorylation of mannose residues on O-linked glycans. This enzymatic activity is crucial for the proper glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan, a key component in cell-matrix interactions, particularly in muscle and neural tissues (Walimbe2020POMK; Nagae20173D). The POMK protein's structure is characterized by a bilobal architecture typical of eukaryotic protein kinases, with unique features such as active site migration and a disulfide bridge that are essential for its function (Nagae20173D; Zhu2016Structure). Mutations in the POMK gene are linked to a range of neuromuscular disorders, collectively known as dystroglycanopathies, highlighting its critical role in muscle integrity and neural development (Di2014POMK; Nagae20173D).

## Structure
The protein O-mannose kinase (POMK) exhibits a typical protein kinase fold with distinct N- and C-lobes. The N-lobe consists of five beta-strands and two alpha-helices, while the C-lobe comprises nine alpha-helices and a beta-hairpin (Nagae20173D). POMK's structure is stabilized by three disulfide bonds and features a conserved cysteine with a free thiol group (Nagae20173D). The active site of POMK is unique, with residues in non-canonical positions, a phenomenon known as active site migration, similar to other kinases like WNK and haspin/Gsg2 (Zhu2016Structure).

POMK is a type II transmembrane protein with a lumenal kinase domain and contains four potential N-linked glycosylation sites (Zhu2016Structure). The protein's tertiary structure includes a bilobal architecture characteristic of eukaryotic protein kinases, with the N-lobe resembling that of protein kinase A (PKA) and a more divergent C-lobe (Zhu2016Structure). The catalytic loop and activation segment are longer compared to PKA, and a disulfide bridge between specific cysteine residues is crucial for structural stability and substrate interaction (Zhu2016Structure). POMK's structure and function are critical for the phosphorylation of mannose residues on O-linked glycans, a process essential for proper glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan (Nagae20173D).

## Function
Protein O-Mannose Kinase (POMK) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the post-translational modification of α-dystroglycan (α-DG), a key component of the dystroglycan complex involved in cell-matrix interactions. POMK phosphorylates the mannose residue on the core M3 trisaccharide of α-DG, which is essential for the elongation of matriglycan by LARGE1, a process crucial for the proper binding of laminin and other extracellular matrix (ECM) components (Walimbe2020POMK). This phosphorylation step is necessary for the synthesis of full-length matriglycan, which is vital for maintaining muscle integrity and function, as well as for the prevention of muscular dystrophy (Walimbe2020POMK).

In healthy human cells, POMK is expressed in various tissues, including muscle, brain, retina, heart, and kidney, indicating its significant role in fetal development and tissue differentiation (Paul2020Further). The enzyme's activity is particularly important in the central nervous system and muscle tissue, where it contributes to structural integrity and proper cellular signaling (Di2014POMK). POMK's function is crucial for the synthesis of matriglycan, which acts as a scaffold for ECM interactions, thereby influencing muscle and nervous system development (Walimbe2024Protein).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the POMK gene are associated with a spectrum of neuromuscular disorders known as dystroglycanopathies. These conditions range from severe forms like Walker-Warburg Syndrome (WWS) to milder forms such as Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy (LGMD) with cognitive impairment. WWS is characterized by severe brain and eye abnormalities, muscle weakness, and developmental delays, often resulting from compound heterozygous mutations in POMK that disrupt the kinase domain essential for its function (Di2014POMK; Nagae20173D). In contrast, LGMD presents with milder symptoms, including muscle weakness and intellectual disability, and is associated with homozygous nonsense mutations leading to truncated POMK proteins (Di2014POMK).

POMK mutations impair the glycosylation of α-dystroglycan, a process crucial for muscle integrity and extracellular matrix interactions. This disruption leads to improper muscle development and function, as evidenced by reduced expression of laminin and dystrophin in affected tissues (Di2014POMK; von2014POMKmutation). The phenotypic variability observed in patients suggests that POMK may interact with other proteins, influencing the severity of the clinical manifestations (Di2014POMK). These findings underscore the critical role of POMK in maintaining normal muscle and neural development.

## Interactions
Protein O-mannose kinase (POMK) is involved in several interactions crucial for its function in glycosylation pathways. POMK phosphorylates the mannose residue on the core M3 trisaccharide of alpha-dystroglycan (α-DG), a modification essential for the subsequent elongation of matriglycan by the enzyme LARGE1. This interaction is critical for the proper binding of α-DG to extracellular matrix proteins like laminin, which is necessary for muscle integrity and function (Walimbe2020POMK).

POMK's interaction with LARGE1 is particularly significant, as LARGE1 shows a preference for the phosphorylated form of the core M3 glycan, which enhances its ability to elongate matriglycan. This phosphorylation by POMK is thus a key regulatory step in the synthesis of full-length matriglycan, which acts as a scaffold for extracellular matrix proteins (Walimbe2024Protein; Walimbe2020POMK).

In addition to its role in glycosylation, POMK's interactions may also involve other proteins that regulate phosphorylation processes, as suggested by the variability in clinical presentations among individuals with POMK mutations. This implies that POMK might interact with other proteins to modulate its activity and ensure proper glycan expression (Di2014POMK).
