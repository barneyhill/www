# TM2D2

## Overview
TM2D2 is a gene that encodes the protein TM2 domain containing 2, which is a member of the TM2 domain-containing protein family. This protein is characterized by its involvement in cellular signaling pathways, particularly in the regulation of Notch signaling and neuronal function. TM2 domain containing 2 is implicated in forming protein complexes with other TM2D family members, such as TM2D1 and TM2D3, which are thought to influence processes like phagocytosis and protein trafficking (Salazar2021TM2D; Sandow2021Proteomic). The gene has been associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorder, and is evolutionarily conserved, suggesting a potential role in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases (Hall2020Ciseffects; Salazar2021TM2D). Further research is required to fully understand the clinical implications of TM2D2 in human health.

## Clinical Significance
TM2D2 has been associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). A study found that decreased expression of a transcript of the TM2D2 gene is linked to ASD, with statistical significance at a Bonferroni-corrected P < 0.05. This association was observed outside of a common polymorphic inversion on chromosome 17q21, which is known to influence the regulation of numerous genes in the fetal brain (Hall2020Ciseffects).

In Drosophila, TM2D2, along with other TM2D family genes, plays a role in regulating Notch signaling, which is crucial for neuronal function and development. Although the specific role of TM2D2 in human diseases is less explored, the gene's involvement in Notch signaling pathways suggests potential implications in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders (Salazar2021TM2D). The TM2D gene family, including TM2D2, is evolutionarily conserved and implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, although direct functional data linking TM2D2 to AD in humans is not yet established (Salazar2021TM2D). Further research is needed to elucidate the specific clinical significance of TM2D2 in human health.

## Interactions
TM2D2, a member of the TM2 domain-containing protein family, is implicated in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In Drosophila, the ortholog of TM2D2, known as amrt, has been shown to interact with other TM2D family proteins, such as TM2D1 (bisc) and TM2D3 (amx). These interactions suggest that TM2D proteins may form a complex, as indicated by high-throughput proteomics experiments that detected physical interactions between TM2D1-TM2D3 and TM2D2-TM2D3 (Salazar2021TM2D). This complex formation is thought to play a role in regulating Notch signaling and neuronal function, as well as in processes like phagocytosis (Salazar2021TM2D).

Additionally, TM2D2 is upregulated by MARCH3, a membrane-associated ring-CH protein, which suggests a regulatory relationship between these proteins. MARCH3's role in modulating immune cell adhesion and signaling through various target proteins, including TM2D2, highlights the potential involvement of TM2D2 in protein trafficking (Sandow2021Proteomic). These interactions underscore the importance of TM2D2 in cellular signaling pathways and its potential involvement in complex regulatory networks.
