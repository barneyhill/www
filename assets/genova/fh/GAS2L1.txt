# GAS2L1

## Overview
GAS2L1, or growth arrest-specific 2 like 1, is a gene that encodes a cytoskeletal protein involved in the regulation of centrosome dynamics and cytoskeletal organization. The GAS2L1 protein is a member of the growth arrest-specific 2 (GAS2) protein family and is characterized by its ability to interact with both actin filaments and microtubules, functioning as a cytolinker. It contains distinct structural domains, including a calponin homology (CH) domain and a GAS2-related (GAR) domain, which facilitate its role in binding to cytoskeletal components. GAS2L1 is crucial for centrosome disjunction and motility, as well as for maintaining axon morphology by stabilizing actin filaments in conjunction with microtubules (van2019Cytolinker; Au2017GAS2L1). The protein's interactions with end-binding (EB) proteins and its involvement in cytoskeletal dynamics underscore its importance in cellular processes and structural integrity (Stroud2014GAS2like).

## Structure
The GAS2L1 protein is a member of the growth arrest-specific 2 (GAS2) protein family and is characterized by several distinct structural domains. It contains a calponin homology (CH) domain, which is responsible for binding to actin filaments, and a GAS2-related (GAR) domain that interacts with microtubules (Zhang2020Growth; Au2017GAS2L1). The protein also features a Ser-x-Ile-Pro (SxIP) motif at the C-terminus, which serves as a microtubule positioning signal and is crucial for binding to end-binding (EB) proteins (van2019Cytolinker; Zhang2020Growth).

GAS2L1 exists in two isoforms due to alternative splicing: GAS2L1α, which is 337 amino acids long, and GAS2L1β, which is 681 amino acids long. The β isoform includes additional structural features such as a non-canonical end-binding motif (EBM) and a potential microtubule localization signal (MtLS) (Zhang2020Growth).

The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at specific sites such as Ser600, Ser602, and Ser352, with the latter being phosphorylated by Nek2A during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (Zhang2020Growth). These structural elements and modifications contribute to GAS2L1's role in cytoskeletal organization and cellular processes.

## Function
The GAS2L1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in centrosome dynamics and disjunction in human cells. GAS2L1 is associated with the proximal end of mature centrioles and is essential for centriole motility and centrosome disjunction. It facilitates the attachment of microtubules and actin filaments to centrosomes, which is necessary for their positioning, movement, and separation (Au2017GAS2L1). The protein's function in centrosome splitting is independent of the Eg5 motor protein and does not affect centriole duplication (Au2017GAS2L1).

GAS2L1 contains a calponin homology (CH) domain and a GAS2-related (GAR) domain, which bind to actin filaments and microtubules, respectively. These domains are critical for its role in centrosome separation (Au2017GAS2L1). The protein also interacts with end-binding proteins (EB1/3), which is essential for its centrosome-separating activity (Au2017GAS2L1). In addition to its role in centrosome dynamics, GAS2L1 is involved in maintaining axon morphology by stabilizing actin filaments in conjunction with microtubules, which is crucial for the structural integrity of axons (van2019Cytolinker).

## Interactions
GAS2L1 interacts with both actin filaments and microtubules, playing a crucial role in cytoskeletal dynamics. It specifically localizes to actin-microtubule overlaps, suggesting it mediates crosstalk between these structures. GAS2L1 does not bind to single actin filaments or microtubules alone, but its individual domains can bind actin filaments, the microtubule lattice, and microtubule plus ends. This indicates that GAS2L1 functions as a crosslinker between actin and microtubules (van2019Cytolinker).

The protein is autoinhibited through an interaction between its calponin homology (CH) domain and its microtubule-binding tail, which competes with actin binding. This autoinhibition is relieved when GAS2L1 binds simultaneously to actin filaments and microtubules, promoting selective activity at actin-microtubule interfaces (van2019Cytolinker).

GAS2L1 also interacts with end-binding (EB) proteins through SxIP motifs located at its C-terminus. This interaction is crucial for its role in microtubule dynamics and stability, as well as in guiding microtubules along actin stress fibers (Stroud2014GAS2like). These interactions highlight GAS2L1's role in maintaining cytoskeletal integrity and facilitating communication between microtubules and actin.
