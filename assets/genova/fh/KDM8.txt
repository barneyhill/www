# KDM8

## Overview
KDM8 is a gene that encodes the protein lysine demethylase 8, a member of the JmjC domain-containing family of proteins. This protein functions primarily as a histone demethylase, specifically targeting dimethylated lysine 36 on histone H3 (H3K36me2), thereby playing a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression through chromatin remodeling (Verrier2011Histone; Hsia2010KDM8). Beyond its demethylase activity, KDM8 is also implicated in various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, circadian rhythm regulation, and glucose metabolism (Huang2017Histone). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as the androgen receptor and pyruvate kinase M2, highlight its involvement in cancer progression, particularly in prostate and breast cancers (Wang2018KDM8JMJD5; Hsia2010KDM8). KDM8's dual role in different cancer types, acting as both an oncogene and a tumor suppressor, underscores its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Chang2019Dual).

## Structure
KDM8, also known as lysine demethylase 8, is a member of the JmjC domain-containing family of proteins. The primary structure of KDM8 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its functional domains. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the formation of the protein's tertiary structure. The JmjC domain is a prominent feature of KDM8, characterized by a 'jellyroll' double-stranded β-helix structure that is essential for its catalytic activity. This domain binds Fe2+ and α-ketoglutarate, facilitating the hydroxylation reaction necessary for demethylase activity (Wang2020Modular).

KDM8 also contains motifs such as NLS, Ser-rich, TPR, and JmjN, which are important for nuclear localization and enzyme-substrate complex stabilization (Wang2020Modular). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can regulate its activity. KDM8 is known to exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may affect its functional properties. The protein's structure and domain architecture are integral to its role in demethylating specific histone residues, such as H3K36, and in regulating gene transcription (Verrier2011Histone).

## Function
KDM8, also known as JMJD5, is a histone demethylase that specifically targets the dimethylated lysine 36 on histone H3 (H3K36me2). This demethylation activity plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression by altering chromatin structure, thereby influencing transcriptional activity. KDM8 is involved in the activation of the cyclin A1 gene by demethylating H3K36me2 in its coding region, which prevents the recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and promotes active transcription (Verrier2011Histone; Hsia2010KDM8). This activity is essential for cell cycle progression, particularly in the G2/M phase, as KDM8 upregulates cyclin A1 expression, which is crucial for this phase (Hsia2010KDM8).

KDM8 is also implicated in regulating other biological processes, such as circadian rhythm and glucose metabolism, by modulating the expression of genes involved in these pathways (Huang2017Histone). Although initially identified as a demethylase, some studies suggest that KDM8 may also function as a dioxygenase or an aminopeptidase, indicating potential roles beyond histone demethylation (Sterling2020Histone). KDM8 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it contributes to maintaining genomic stability and regulating transcriptional activity.

## Clinical Significance
KDM8, also known as lysine demethylase 8, plays a significant role in various cancers due to its involvement in cell cycle regulation and tumor progression. In breast cancer, KDM8 is overexpressed and is crucial for cell proliferation by regulating the G2/M phase of the cell cycle through cyclin A1 expression (Hsia2010KDM8). Its overexpression is also observed in prostate cancer, particularly in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), where it acts as a coactivator of the androgen receptor (AR) and pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), contributing to therapy resistance and metabolic reprogramming (Wang2018KDM8JMJD5). KDM8's interaction with AR enhances the transcription of genes like EZH2, which is crucial for androgen-independent growth, making it a potential therapeutic target in resistant prostate cancer (Wang2018KDM8JMJD5).

In contrast, KDM8 is downregulated in liver and pancreatic cancers, where its expression is associated with better survival outcomes. High levels of KDM8 correlate with a lower risk of death, suggesting a tumor suppressive role in these cancers (Chang2019Dual). This dual role of KDM8 in different cancer types underscores its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
KDM8, also known as lysine demethylase 8, participates in various protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. It acts as a coactivator of the androgen receptor (AR) in prostate cancer, enhancing AR's transcriptional activity by forming complexes with AR, particularly interacting with its DNA-binding and ligand-binding domains (Wang2018KDM8JMJD5). KDM8 is also involved in the AR/PKM2 network, where it interacts with pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) to facilitate its nuclear translocation, which is crucial for metabolic adaptation in cancer cells (Wang2018KDM8JMJD5).

KDM8 forms a complex with RCCD1, a protein that stimulates its demethylase activity. This interaction is essential for cell cycle progression and mitotic spindle organization, as RCCD1 acts as a cofactor enabling KDM8's enzymatic function (Marcon2014HumanChromatinRelated). The KDM8-RCCD1 complex is also involved in the transcriptional repression of satellite repeats during the M phase of the cell cycle, contributing to chromosomal stability (Marcon2014HumanChromatinRelated).

KDM8's interactions extend to chromatin remodeling, where it is recruited to the promoters of AR target genes, facilitating AR targeting to chromatin and enhancing the expression of genes like EZH2, which are involved in prostate cancer progression (Wang2018KDM8JMJD5).
