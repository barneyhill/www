# TMEM100

## Overview
TMEM100 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 100, which is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including vascular development and pain signaling. As a transmembrane protein, TMEM100 plays a crucial role in the regulation of ion channels and signaling pathways. It is particularly significant in the context of embryonic vascular formation and nerve growth, where it is expressed in endothelial cells and neurons, respectively. TMEM100 is activated by the ALK1/ACVRL1 receptor signaling pathway and is implicated in several human diseases, such as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Additionally, TMEM100 modulates the activity of TRPA1 and TRPV1 ion channels, influencing pain perception and mechanosensitivity (Yu2019Transmembrane; Nees2023Role; Kinugasa‐Katayama2021Tmem100‐BAC‐EGFP). Its interactions with other proteins and involvement in various signaling pathways underscore its potential as a therapeutic target in conditions like cardiac hypertrophy and certain cancers (Zhang2024TMEM100; Pan2023The).

## Structure


## Function
TMEM100 is a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of vascular development and nerve growth. In the context of vascular development, TMEM100 is expressed in endothelial cells of large caliber arteries during embryonic development. It is essential for embryonic vascular formation, as evidenced by severe cardiovascular defects in Tmem100 null mice, which die around embryonic day 10.5 (Kinugasa‐Katayama2021Tmem100‐BAC‐EGFP). TMEM100 is activated by the ALK1/ACVRL1 receptor signaling pathway and is considered a downstream gene of ALK1 signaling, which is significant in human diseases like hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and pulmonary arterial hypertension (Kinugasa‐Katayama2021Tmem100‐BAC‐EGFP).

In the nervous system, TMEM100 is expressed in neurons and glial cells of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). It is highly colocalized with TRPV1 and TRPA1 receptors, indicating its role in pain signaling. TMEM100 modulates the activity of TRPA1 by releasing it from inhibition by TRPV1, thereby influencing mechanosensitivity and pain signaling (Yu2019Transmembrane; Nees2023Role). TMEM100 is not a channel itself but plays a role in potentiating the activity of ion channels, such as TRPA1, in specific cellular contexts (Nees2023Role).

## Clinical Significance
TMEM100 is implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression or function. In pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), TMEM100 downregulation is observed, suggesting its involvement in the disease's pathogenesis (Pan2023The). TMEM100 also plays a role in various cancers, acting as a tumor suppressor. Its expression is downregulated in lung adenocarcinoma, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, and non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), where it inhibits cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Pan2023The). In gastric cancer, TMEM100 downregulation is associated with increased cell migration and invasion, while its overexpression enhances sensitivity to chemotherapy (Zhuang2019TMEM100; Xie2023Identification).

TMEM100 is also involved in pain modulation, influencing pain reception by interacting with TRPA1 and TRPV1 complexes (Pan2023The). In the context of cardiac hypertrophy, TMEM100 acts as a protective factor, with its upregulation suppressing hypertrophic responses in cardiomyocytes (Zhang2024TMEM100). These findings highlight TMEM100's potential as a therapeutic target in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
TMEM100 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. In the context of cardiac hypertrophy, TMEM100 interacts with TAK1 (transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1), inhibiting its phosphorylation and subsequently affecting the TAK1-JNK/p38 signaling pathway. This interaction is crucial for TMEM100's role in mitigating pathological cardiac hypertrophy, as it inhibits the phosphorylation of downstream molecules JNK and p38, which are part of the MAPK signaling pathway (Zhang2024TMEM100).

In sensory neurons, TMEM100 interacts with TRPA1 and TRPV1 ion channels, which are involved in pain perception. TMEM100 modulates the physical association between these channels, weakening the interaction between TRPA1 and TRPV1, which leads to the disinhibition of TRPA1 activity. This modulation is significant in the context of pain pathways, as it influences the transduction of pain signals in trigeminal ganglion neurons (Weng2015Tmem100). TMEM100's interaction with these ion channels is context-dependent, as it enhances TRPA1 activity in the presence of TRPV1 but can inhibit TRPA1 when TRPV1 is absent (Weng2015Tmem100).
