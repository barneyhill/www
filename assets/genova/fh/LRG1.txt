# LRG1

## Overview
Leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) is a gene that encodes a secreted glycoprotein involved in various physiological and pathological processes. The LRG1 protein is characterized by its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, and is heavily glycosylated, influencing its function and molecular weight (Yang2023Crystal; Camilli2022LRG1:). Functionally, LRG1 plays a crucial role in maintaining extracellular matrix integrity and modulating the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway, impacting processes such as tissue regeneration, immune response, and neovascularization (Park2023LRG1). LRG1's interactions with various proteins, including TGFβ receptors and cytochrome c, underscore its involvement in angiogenesis, inflammation modulation, and cancer progression (Song2015The; Choi2021LRG1). Clinically, dysregulation of LRG1 expression is associated with diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, colorectal cancer, and fibrotic conditions, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (De2022LRG1; Zhang2016LRG1).

## Structure
LRG1, or leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein 1, is a glycoprotein characterized by a single polypeptide chain consisting of 312 amino acid residues. It features eight leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), which are motifs involved in protein-ligand interactions, typically arranged in repetitive stretches. Each LRR consists of 19-29 amino acids, forming a horseshoe-shaped solenoid domain that facilitates protein-protein interactions (Yang2023Crystal; Camilli2022LRG1:).

The protein's secondary structure includes parallel β-strands on the concave face and short 3_10 helices or connecting loops on the convex surface. The LRRNT domain contains three β-strands stabilized by a disulfide bridge, while the LRRCT domain also contains a disulfide bond (Yang2023Crystal).

LRG1 is heavily glycosylated, with a carbohydrate content of approximately 23% by weight. It has five predicted glycosylation sites, with N-acetylglucosamines attached to four asparagine residues. Glycosylation patterns differ between serum-derived and neutrophil-derived LRG1, affecting molecular weight and function (Yang2023Crystal; Camilli2022LRG1:).

The protein's tertiary structure has been elucidated through crystallography, revealing a characteristic curved solenoid structure typical of LRR proteins. This structure is crucial for its interactions, such as with cytochrome c and the LPHN2 receptor (Yang2023Crystal). The crystal structure of LRG1 has been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession code 8H24 (Yang2023Crystal).

## Function
Leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) is a secreted glycoprotein that plays a significant role in maintaining extracellular matrix (ECM) integrity in fibroblasts by activating the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway. In healthy human cells, LRG1 is expressed in fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and endothelial cells, and is involved in physiological processes such as immune response regulation, tissue regeneration, and neovascularization (Park2023LRG1). LRG1 promotes ECM integrity by increasing type I collagen secretion and decreasing matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) secretion, which are crucial for skin repair and reducing skin aging (Park2023LRG1). 

LRG1 enhances the TGF-β1 signaling pathway by binding to TGFβ receptors, activating downstream mediators like SMADs, which are key components of this pathway (Park2023LRG1). This activation leads to increased phosphorylation of SMAD2 and SMAD3, promoting collagen production and reducing collagen degradation (Park2023LRG1). LRG1 also plays a role in modulating gene expression related to ECM integrity, as evidenced by RNA sequencing studies showing its impact on genes associated with the extracellular region and matrix (Park2023LRG1). Overall, LRG1 acts as an upstream regulator of TGF-β signaling, contributing to ECM synthesis and integrity in healthy human cells (Park2023LRG1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LRG1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly those involving pathological angiogenesis and fibrosis. In eye diseases such as diabetic retinopathy (DR) and neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nvAMD), LRG1 is upregulated, contributing to vascular dysfunction and pathological angiogenesis by disrupting pericyte-endothelial cell interactions and promoting endothelial cell activation (De2022LRG1; Camilli2022LRG1:). LRG1 also plays a role in fibrosis through the TGFβ/SMAD pathway, enhancing SMAD-2 signaling in fibroblasts and contributing to a pro-fibrotic gene signature (De2022LRG1).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), LRG1 expression is significantly increased, correlating with tumor progression, deeper invasion, and lymph node metastasis. It enhances CRC cell invasiveness and induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through HIF-1α activation, promoting angiogenesis by increasing VEGF-A expression (Zhong2021Colorectal; Zhang2016LRG1). LRG1 is also implicated in cardiovascular diseases, where its expression is linked to both protective and pathogenic effects, such as modulating inflammation and promoting autophagy in myocardial infarction (Camilli2022LRG1:). In lung diseases, LRG1 contributes to fibrosis and endothelial dysfunction, with elevated levels observed in conditions like idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and COPD/emphysema (Camilli2022LRG1:).

## Interactions
LRG1 interacts with several proteins, influencing various biological processes. It is known to modulate transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) signaling by interacting with multiple TGFβ receptors. LRG1 promotes binding to the angiogenic receptor ALK1 while inhibiting association with the angiostatic receptor ALK5, enhancing Smad 1 and 5 phosphorylation, which leads to endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis (Song2015The). 

LRG1 also interacts with cytochrome c (Cyt c), a protein released from dying cells that can act as a pro-inflammatory signal. LRG1 binds to Cyt c in circulation, forming a complex that reduces Cyt c's pro-inflammatory effects, thereby modulating inflammation and reducing cell death (Choi2021LRG1). This interaction is crucial for LRG1's ability to suppress inflammation, as pre-treatment of macrophages with LRG1 without Cyt c does not reduce inflammation (Choi2021LRG1).

In the context of cancer, LRG1 has been identified as a novel ligand for the human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3), promoting colorectal cancer cell growth through a distinct signaling pathway involving PI3K-PDK1-RSK-eIF4B (Wang2023LRG1). This interaction highlights LRG1's role in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.
