# SYCE2

## Overview
SYCE2 is a gene that encodes the synaptonemal complex central element protein 2, a critical component of the synaptonemal complex (SC) involved in meiosis. The protein plays a pivotal role in the assembly and stability of the SC, facilitating the synapsis of homologous chromosomes and enabling genetic recombination. SYCE2 is categorized as a structural protein, forming part of the central element of the SC through its interaction with TEX12, another synaptonemal complex protein. This interaction results in a hetero-octameric complex essential for the structural integrity and function of the SC. The SYCE2-TEX12 complex is crucial for chromosome pairing and recombination during meiotic prophase I, contributing to genomic stability and fertility. Mutations in the SYCE2 gene have been linked to reproductive issues, including infertility and pregnancy loss, underscoring its importance in meiotic processes (BolcunFilas2007SYCE2; Davies2012Structural; Steinthorsdottir2024Variant).

## Structure
SYCE2 is a protein involved in the formation of the synaptonemal complex during meiosis. It is composed of 218 amino acids and features a central evolutionarily conserved domain with three predicted alpha-helices. The first of these helices forms a putative coiled-coil structure with a high confidence level, while the N- and C-terminal extensions are unstructured and divergent (Davies2012Structural). The central conserved region, spanning residues 57-165, is crucial for its interaction with TEX12, another synaptonemal complex protein (Davies2012Structural).

The N-terminal a1 region of SYCE2, encompassing residues 57-88, is necessary and sufficient for binding TEX12, suggesting a heterotypic coiled-coil interaction (Davies2012Structural). The central a2-3 region, spanning residues 88-165, is responsible for tetramerization, allowing SYCE2 to form a tetramer in solution (Davies2012Structural). The SYCE2-TEX12 complex is a hetero-octamer, with SYCE2 tetramers binding two TEX12 dimers (Davies2012Structural).

The SYCE2-TEX12 complex can self-associate into larger filamentous structures, forming fibers that are integral to the synaptonemal complex's central element (Davies2012Structural). These fibers are approximately 40 nm wide and can extend up to several micrometers in length (Dunce2020Structural).

## Function
SYCE2 (synaptonemal complex central element protein 2) is a crucial component of the synaptonemal complex (SC), a structure essential for meiosis in human cells. It plays a significant role in the assembly and stability of the SC, facilitating the synapsis of homologous chromosomes and enabling genetic recombination. SYCE2 is part of the central element (CE) of the SC and interacts strongly with TEX12, forming a stable complex that is vital for the structural integrity of the SC (Llano2023Synaptonemal; Davies2012Structural).

The SYCE2-TEX12 complex forms a hetero-octameric assembly, which is essential for the proper organization of the SC, supporting chromosome pairing and recombination during meiosis (Davies2012Structural). SYCE2 is active in the nucleus during meiotic prophase I, where it contributes to the extension of synapsis along the axial elements, ensuring stable synapsis and efficient double-strand break repair (BolcunFilas2007SYCE2; Llano2023Synaptonemal).

Deficiencies in SYCE2 lead to failed synapsis and crossover formation, resulting in meiotic arrest and infertility, highlighting its essential role in maintaining genomic stability and fertility (BolcunFilas2007SYCE2; Davies2012Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SYCE2 gene have been associated with reproductive issues, particularly infertility and pregnancy loss. The SYCE2 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the synaptonemal complex, which is essential for proper chromosome synapsis and recombination during meiosis. Disruptions in this process can lead to meiotic errors, resulting in infertility due to failed chromosome segregation and gamete production (BolcunFilas2007SYCE2; Davies2012Structural).

A specific missense variant, SYCE2:p.His89Tyr, has been linked to an increased risk of pregnancy loss. This variant affects the recombination process by altering the placement and rate of crossovers, particularly in larger chromosomes, which can lead to chromosomal abnormalities such as aneuploidy. These abnormalities are a common cause of pregnancy loss, often maternally transmitted (Steinthorsdottir2024Variant).

Research has also suggested that mutations in SYCE2 may contribute to idiopathic infertility in humans, as similar disruptions in synaptonemal complex proteins have been observed in mouse models, leading to synaptic failure and meiotic arrest (Geisinger2016Mutations; Hosoya2021Synaptonemal).

## Interactions
SYCE2 is a crucial component of the synaptonemal complex (SC) and interacts with several other proteins to facilitate meiotic chromosome synapsis. It forms a stable and constitutive complex with TEX12, which is essential for the assembly and function of the SC. This interaction is characterized by the binding of the N-terminal a1 region of SYCE2 to the C-terminal a3 region of TEX12, forming a hetero-octameric structure that is crucial for the assembly of the SC's central element (Davies2012Structural). 

SYCE2 also interacts with SYCE1 and SYCP1, forming dimers or tetramers that are necessary for the polymerization and stability of the SC. These interactions are essential for the proper extension and stabilization of synapsis, as evidenced by the failure of synapsis in SYCE2 knockout models (BolcunFilas2007SYCE2). The SYCE2-TEX12 complex assembles into fibrous structures that provide structural support along the chromosome axis, facilitating synaptic elongation during meiosis (Dunce2020Structural). 

The interactions of SYCE2 with these proteins are critical for maintaining the integrity of the SC, and disruptions in these interactions can lead to synaptic failure and associated meiotic defects (Davies2012Structural).
