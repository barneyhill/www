# PCDH9

## Overview
Protocadherin 9 (PCDH9) is a gene that encodes the protein protocadherin 9, a member of the non-clustered δ-protocadherin family, which is part of the larger cadherin superfamily. This protein is characterized by its extracellular cadherin (EC) domains, which facilitate cell-cell adhesion through homophilic interactions. Protocadherin 9 plays a crucial role in the central nervous system (CNS), particularly in the formation and maintenance of neuronal circuits, synaptic development, and cognitive functions (Harrison2020Familywide; Mancini2020Right). The gene's expression is prominent in various CNS regions during early development and decreases in adulthood, highlighting its importance in neural development (Mancini2020Right). Additionally, PCDH9 has been implicated in several neurological disorders and cancers, where its altered expression can influence disease progression and patient outcomes (Wang2012Downregulation; Miozzo2024Disruption).

## Structure
Protocadherin 9 (PCDH9) is a member of the non-clustered δ-protocadherin family, characterized by its extracellular cadherin (EC) domains. The primary structure of PCDH9 includes a sequence of amino acids encoded by the PCDH9 gene, which forms the basis for its secondary and tertiary structures. The secondary structure of PCDH9 involves cadherin repeats that form the EC domains, crucial for its adhesive functions (Harrison2020Familywide).

The tertiary structure of PCDH9 is defined by the folding of these EC domains, facilitating homophilic trans dimerization, which is a common feature among δ-protocadherins. This interaction is mediated by the EC1-EC4 regions binding in an antiparallel orientation, promoting dimer affinity and specificity (Nicoludis2016Antiparallel). The quaternary structure of PCDH9 is primarily dimeric, as confirmed by size exclusion chromatography with multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) and sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC), which showed that PCDH9 forms stable homodimers with a dissociation constant (K D) of 2.03 μM (Harrison2020Familywide).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation may occur, influencing the protein's function and stability. PCDH9 may also have splice variant isoforms, which could result in distinct functional properties, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
PCDH9 (protocadherin 9) is a member of the cadherin superfamily, specifically within the PCDHδ1 sub-group, and plays a significant role in the central nervous system (CNS) by contributing to the formation and maintenance of neuronal circuits. It is involved in synaptic development, influencing synapse formation, maturation, and elimination, which are crucial for proper neural circuit development (Mancini2020Right). PCDH9 is expressed in various regions of the CNS, including the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, caudate putamen, and cerebral cortex, particularly during early developmental stages, and its expression decreases in adulthood (Mancini2020Right).

The protein is primarily active in synaptic junctions, where it contributes to synaptic signaling and neural circuit formation, essential for cognitive functions and neural development (Mancini2020Right). PCDH9's role in cell biology includes influencing cortical thickness and synapse development, which are critical for processing sensory information and social adaptation (Mancini2020Right). The absence of PCDH9 has been linked to increased cell density and impaired sensory processing, highlighting its importance in maintaining proper neuronal function and connectivity (Mancini2020Right).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the PCDH9 gene have been linked to several neurological and psychiatric disorders. PCDH9 is associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). In ASD, structural variations like copy number variations (CNVs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PCDH9 have been identified, with SNP rs9540720 specifically linked to MDD and cognitive function impairment (Hirabayashi2013Protocadherins; Miozzo2024Disruption). PCDH9 knockout mice exhibit synaptic overgrowth and abnormal excitatory transmission, leading to behavioral abnormalities such as social and object recognition deficits, hyperactivity, and reduced sensorimotor competence (Miozzo2024Disruption).

PCDH9 also plays a role in various cancers, acting as a tumor suppressor. Its expression is significantly lower in several cancers, including glioma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and gastric cancer, where its downregulation is associated with higher tumor grades and poorer patient survival (Lv2017PCDH9; Izycka2019Semaphorin; Wang2012Downregulation). In gliomas, reduced PCDH9 expression correlates with more aggressive tumors and shorter survival times, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Wang2013Characterizing; Wang2012Downregulation).

## Interactions
PCDH9, a member of the protocadherin family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In melanoma cells, PCDH9 interacts with Pyk2 and RAC1, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. These interactions suggest that PCDH9 may regulate RAC1/ROS-dependent NADPH oxidase complexes, similar to the function of Hace1, but requires the assistance of Pyk2 (Zhang2020PCDH9). Overexpression of PCDH9 in melanoma cell lines leads to upregulation of Pyk2 and Cyclin D1, while RAC1, MMP1, and MMP9 are downregulated, promoting apoptosis (Zhang2020PCDH9).

In prostate cancer, PCDH9 interacts with the regulatory subunit of PI3K, p85α, suppressing the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This interaction is significant as it influences cell proliferation, invasion, and migration (Zhang2020piR001773). The study also found that piR-001773 and piR-017184 promote prostate cancer progression by downregulating PCDH9 and activating the PI3K/AKT pathway (Zhang2020piR001773).

In glioma cells, restoration of PCDH9 expression leads to increased apoptosis and altered cell cycle distribution, suggesting its role in promoting apoptosis through interactions that increase Bax expression and decrease Bcl-2 and Cyclin D1 expressions (Wang2013Characterizing).
