# CCNB2

## Overview
Cyclin B2 (CCNB2) is a gene that encodes the cyclin B2 protein, a regulatory component of the cell cycle. Cyclin B2 is a member of the cyclin family, which is characterized by its role in controlling the progression of cells through the cell cycle by activating cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). Specifically, cyclin B2 forms a complex with CDK1, facilitating the transition from the G2 phase to the M phase of the cell cycle, which is crucial for mitosis and cell division (Wolgemuth2008Function; Shubbar2013Elevated). The protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and is associated with the Golgi apparatus, distinguishing it from other cyclins such as cyclin B1 (Jackman1995Human). Cyclin B2's interactions with other proteins, such as aurora A kinase and Plk1, underscore its importance in centrosome dynamics and chromosome segregation (Nam2014Cyclin). Aberrations in CCNB2 expression have been linked to various cancers, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Liu2020CCNB2; Ikeya2020CCNB2).

## Function
Cyclin B2 (CCNB2) is a regulatory protein that plays a crucial role in the cell cycle, particularly during the transition from the G2 phase to the M phase. It forms a complex with cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), which is essential for the initiation of mitosis. This complex facilitates the progression of cells through the mitotic phase by activating CDC2 kinase, a critical step for cell division and proliferation (Wolgemuth2008Function; Shubbar2013Elevated).

In healthy human cells, cyclin B2 is involved in ensuring proper chromosome segregation and centrosome separation, which are vital for maintaining genomic stability. Cyclin B2 co-localizes with centrosomal markers and is involved in the regulation of centrosome separation and spindle geometry during mitosis. This regulation is crucial for accurate chromosome segregation, preventing aneuploidy and ensuring normal cell cycle progression (Nam2014Cyclin).

Cyclin B2 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it influences the timing of centrosome separation through its interaction with aurora A and Plk1, two proteins involved in centrosome dynamics. This activity is essential for proper spindle pole positioning and chromosome segregation during cell division (Nam2014Cyclin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CCNB2 gene have been implicated in various cancers and other diseases. In adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), overexpression of CCNB2 is associated with atypical mitosis and poor prognosis, particularly in cases with TP53 somatic variants. High mRNA expression levels of CCNB2, along with CDK1 and AURKA, correlate with poorer overall survival in ACC patients, suggesting its role in disease progression (Ikeya2020CCNB2).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CCNB2 is identified as a hub gene involved in tumorigenesis. Its overexpression is linked to poor prognosis, and inhibition of CCNB2 expression in cell studies has shown decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Liu2020CCNB2).

CCNB2 is also significantly upregulated in lung cancer, including lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma, as well as in cerebral ischemic stroke. Its expression is associated with clinical factors such as age, pathological stage, and survival rates, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for these conditions (Li2022Upregulation).

In bladder cancer, CCNB2 is involved in critical cellular processes such as the cell cycle and oocyte meiosis, with its expression alterations potentially contributing to cancer progression (Han2017Identification).

## Interactions
Cyclin B2 (CCNB2) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a crucial role in cell cycle regulation. It forms a complex with cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), which is essential for the G2/M transition during the cell cycle. This complex is involved in the regulation of centrosome separation and mitotic progression by activating aurora A kinase, which in turn hyperactivates polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) (Nam2014Cyclin). Cyclin B2 also interacts with separase, inhibiting its activity through phosphorylation during oocyte meiosis, which is crucial for proper chromosome segregation (Li2019The; Li2021The).

Cyclin B2 is associated with the Golgi apparatus, distinct from cyclin B1, which is linked to microtubules. This localization suggests specific roles for cyclin B2 related to its subcellular environment (Jackman1995Human). In cancer contexts, cyclin B2 overexpression can lead to chromosomal instability by overriding p53-mediated inhibition of aurora A kinase activity, contributing to tumorigenesis (Nam2014Cyclin). Additionally, cyclin B2 interacts with JMJD6, an epigenetic modifier, influencing its expression and impacting the p53 signaling pathway in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (Liu2024Cyclin).
