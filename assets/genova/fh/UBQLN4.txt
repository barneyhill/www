# UBQLN4

## Overview
UBQLN4 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquilin 4, which is a member of the ubiquilin family involved in protein quality control and cellular stress responses. Ubiquilin 4 is characterized by its ubiquitin-like (UBL) and ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains, which facilitate its role as a shuttle factor in proteasome-mediated protein degradation. This protein is crucial for maintaining genomic stability, as it participates in the DNA damage response (DDR) and repair processes, particularly influencing the choice between homologous recombination repair (HRR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathways. Ubiquilin 4 also plays a significant role in targeting mislocalized transmembrane domain proteins for degradation, thereby preventing proteotoxic stress. Its involvement in various cellular processes, including interactions with proteins such as MRE11 and BAG6, underscores its importance in both normal cellular function and disease states, including cancer (Jachimowicz2019UBQLN4; Suzuki2016UBQLN4; Liu2021UBQLN4).

## Structure
UBQLN4 is characterized by its ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain at the N-terminus and a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain at the C-terminus, which are crucial for its role in protein degradation pathways (Jachimowicz2019UBQLN4; Liu2021UBQLN4). The UBL domain facilitates interactions with the proteasome, while the UBA domain binds ubiquitinated proteins, enabling UBQLN4 to act as a shuttle factor in proteasome-mediated protein degradation (Liu2021UBQLN4).

The protein also contains a central STI-II region, which is important for recognizing and targeting mislocalized transmembrane domain proteins for degradation. This region is distinct from that of UBQLN1 and is crucial for UBQLN4's high affinity to certain substrates, such as IL-2Ra (Suzuki2016UBQLN4).

UBQLN4 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at serine 318, which is ATM-dependent and plays a significant role in the DNA damage response (Jachimowicz2019UBQLN4; Liu2021UBQLN4). This phosphorylation is essential for its interaction with other proteins involved in DNA repair, such as MRE11 (Jachimowicz2019UBQLN4).

The protein can form homo-dimers or polymers, as observed in co-immunoprecipitation experiments, indicating a potential quaternary structure (Jachimowicz2019UBQLN4). Splice variant isoforms of UBQLN4 may contribute to its structural and functional diversity, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
UBQLN4, also known as ubiquilin 4, is a protein that plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability by participating in the DNA damage response (DDR) and repair processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) through its regulation of homologous recombination repair (HRR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathways. UBQLN4 is recruited to sites of DNA damage and is phosphorylated by the ATM kinase, which is essential for its function in DDR (Jachimowicz2019UBQLN4).

UBQLN4 influences the choice between HRR and NHEJ by interacting with the MRE11 nuclease, a key player in HRR. It represses HRR by facilitating the removal of HRR factors from damaged sites, thereby promoting NHEJ (Jachimowicz2019UBQLN4). This regulation is crucial for preventing inappropriate DSB end resection and ensuring efficient DNA repair (Jachimowicz2019UBQLN4).

In addition to its role in DNA repair, UBQLN4 is involved in protein quality control. It recognizes and targets mislocalized transmembrane domain proteins for proteasomal degradation, thus maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing proteotoxic stress (Suzuki2016UBQLN4). UBQLN4 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to its diverse functions in cellular stress responses and protein degradation pathways (Jachimowicz2019UBQLN4).

## Clinical Significance
UBQLN4 is implicated in various cancers due to its role in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and DNA damage response. In colorectal cancer (CRC), UBQLN4 is upregulated and associated with larger tumor size, advanced TNM stage, and lymphatic metastasis. High expression levels correlate with poor prognosis, and UBQLN4 overexpression promotes CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Tang2021UBQLN4).

In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), UBQLN4 is highly expressed and linked to cisplatin resistance. Its overexpression reduces DNA damage, contributing to treatment resistance and poor prognosis (Murakami2021Regulation). UBQLN4 is also upregulated in other cancers, such as liver, breast, ovarian, and lung cancers, often due to DNA amplification. This upregulation is associated with poor overall survival and treatment resistance, particularly to platinum-based chemotherapy, while increasing sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Kobayashi2022Genomic).

In mesothelioma, UBQLN4 stabilizes anti-apoptotic proteins BCL2A1 and BCL2L10, inhibiting apoptosis and contributing to cancer cell survival. Its knockdown increases sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, suggesting a potential therapeutic target (Liu2021UBQLN4). Additionally, mutations in UBQLN4 are linked to a novel autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by intellectual impairment and other clinical symptoms (Jachimowicz2019UBQLN4).

## Interactions
UBQLN4 interacts with various proteins, playing a significant role in protein degradation and cellular processes. It is a BAG6-binding factor that helps eliminate mislocalized transmembrane domain (TMD) proteins by directing them to the proteasome for degradation. This interaction is crucial for recognizing and targeting defective polypeptides that fail to reach the endoplasmic reticulum (Suzuki2016UBQLN4).

UBQLN4 also interacts with the nuclease MRE11 in a ubiquitylation-dependent manner, facilitating the removal of MRE11 from DNA damage sites. This interaction is essential for the proteasomal turnover of MRE11, which is crucial for DNA damage repair (Jachimowicz2019UBQLN4). In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, UBQLN4 accelerates the degradation of ubiquitinated MRE11A, impacting cisplatin resistance and cancer prognosis (Murakami2021Regulation).

In mesothelioma, UBQLN4 interacts with anti-apoptotic proteins BCL2A1 and BCL2L10, stabilizing them and preventing mitochondrial outer membrane permeability, which contributes to its anti-apoptotic effects (Liu2021UBQLN4). UBQLN4 is also involved in the autophagy pathway by recruiting Ubiquilin1 to the autophagy machinery, interacting with LC3, a marker of autophagosomes (Yun2013Ubiquilin4).
