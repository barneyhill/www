# TBC1D16

## Overview
TBC1D16 is a gene that encodes the protein TBC1 domain family member 16, which functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) primarily for Rab GTPases, including Rab4A and Rab5C. This protein is a member of the TBC domain family, characterized by a conserved domain that facilitates its role in intracellular trafficking and receptor recycling. TBC1D16 is involved in modulating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling and has been implicated in various cellular processes, including antiviral responses and cancer progression. The protein's activity is regulated through its interaction with Rab GTPases, influencing processes such as endosomal trafficking and viral replication inhibition. Alterations in TBC1D16 expression and methylation have been associated with several cancers, including melanoma and acute myeloid leukemia, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Liu2021TBC1D16; Goueli2012TBC1D16; Yan2021Novel).

## Structure
TBC1D16 is a protein that contains a TBC domain, which is a conserved domain within the TBC protein family. This domain is crucial for its function as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rab GTPases, specifically Rab5C and Rab4A (Goueli2012TBC1D16; Yan2021Novel). The TBC domain is composed of approximately 200 amino acids and includes highly conserved residues, such as R494 and Q531, which are essential for its antiviral activity against the prototype foamy virus (PFV) (Yan2021Novel).

The protein also contains a serine-enriched (SR) fragment at the C-terminus, although its specific role in the protein's function is less clear compared to the TBC domain (Yan2021Novel). TBC1D16 is involved in intracellular receptor trafficking and is associated with both cytosolic and membrane-bound forms, indicating its dynamic role in cellular processes (Goueli2012TBC1D16).

In terms of post-translational modifications, the presence of serine residues suggests potential phosphorylation sites, which could regulate its activity and interactions. TBC1D16 has been identified in different isoforms, with a shorter form being prevalent in melanoma, which retains similar specificity for Rab4A as the full-length protein (Goueli2012TBC1D16).

## Function
The TBC1D16 gene encodes a protein that functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rab4A, a member of the Rab family of small GTPases involved in intracellular trafficking. TBC1D16 plays a crucial role in regulating receptor recycling and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling by modulating the activity of Rab4A. In healthy human cells, TBC1D16 interferes with the recycling of transferrin, a process essential for iron uptake, by converting membrane-associated GTP-bound Rab4A to a cytosolic GDP-bound form. This conversion reduces the levels of Rab4A on endosomes, affecting the trafficking of receptor tyrosine kinases like EGFR (Goueli2012TBC1D16).

TBC1D16 is both cytosolic and membrane-associated, with the membrane-associated pool colocalizing with transferrin and EGF receptors and early endosome antigen 1, but not with LAMP1 protein. In HeLa cells, overexpression of TBC1D16 enhances EGF-stimulated EGFR degradation, leading to decreased EGFR levels and signaling (Goueli2012TBC1D16). The protein's catalytic activity is necessary for its function, as demonstrated by the altered localization of Rab4A in cells expressing active versus inactive forms of TBC1D16 (Goueli2012TBC1D16). This regulation is significant for maintaining cellular homeostasis and signaling in healthy cells (Goueli2012TBC1D16).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and methylation of the TBC1D16 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In melanoma, TBC1D16 is upregulated, and its overexpression is crucial for melanoma cell growth. It enhances the intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis by Rab4A, affecting receptor recycling and signaling pathways, such as the EGF receptor (EGFR) signaling, which is vital for cancer progression (Goueli2012TBC1D16). TBC1D16 hypomethylation has been associated with tumor progression and metastasis in melanoma and breast cancer, suggesting its role as an epigenetic driver of metastasis (Rodger2019Characterisation).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), TBC1D16 expression and methylation status are linked to chemosensitivity and prognosis. High methylation at the cg16030878 site correlates with increased TBC1D16 mRNA expression, leading to poorer outcomes and increased chemoresistance (Liu2021TBC1D16). Knockdown of TBC1D16 in AML cells results in slower growth and increased sensitivity to certain chemotherapeutic agents (Liu2021TBC1D16).

In colorectal cancer, TBC1D16 is identified as an oncogenic super enhancer, with its repression significantly reducing tumor growth, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2021Genomewide).

## Interactions
TBC1D16 is known to interact with Rab5C, a member of the Rab GTPase family, playing a crucial role in inhibiting the replication of the prototype foamy virus (PFV). This interaction is essential for the suppression of PFV replication, as demonstrated by experiments showing that overexpression of Rab5C reduces the expression of viral proteins Tas and Gag, while a Rab5C mutant lacking the effector region does not exhibit this effect. The interaction between TBC1D16 and Rab5C is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays, which show that the interaction is absent in the Rab5C mutant (Yan2021Novel).

The TBC domain of TBC1D16, particularly the amino acid residues R494 and Q531, is critical for its interaction with Rab5C and its antiviral activity. Mutations at these sites result in a loss of the protein's ability to inhibit PFV replication (Yan2021Novel). TBC1D16 also enhances the PFV-induced activation of the IFN-b promoter and the production of IFN-b, promoting the transcription of downstream genes such as IFNB1, ISG15, CXCL10, and CCL5 in response to PFV (Yan2021Novel). These interactions highlight TBC1D16's role in regulating viral replication and the host's antiviral response.
