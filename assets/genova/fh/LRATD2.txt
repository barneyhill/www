# LRATD2

## Overview
LRATD2 (LRAT domain containing 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in lipid metabolism, specifically in the acylation of retinol to form retinyl esters, a crucial step in vitamin A metabolism. The protein, also referred to as FAM84B, is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it plays a significant role in the synthesis and storage of retinyl esters, essential for vision, immune function, and cellular differentiation. Beyond its metabolic functions, LRATD2 is implicated in cancer biology, particularly in prostate and breast cancers, where it is associated with cancer progression and poor prognosis. The protein's interactions, such as those in the FAM84B/CDKN1B/MYC/WWP1 axis, underscore its potential as a therapeutic target. Additionally, LRATD2's involvement in the Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) mechanism suggests a broader role in cellular processes beyond lipid metabolism (ArmendárizCastillo2020TCGA; Jin2024Extrachromosomal).

## Function
LRATD2 (LRAT domain containing 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in lipid metabolism, specifically in the transfer of acyl groups to retinol, forming retinyl esters. This process is a critical component of vitamin A metabolism, which is essential for various physiological functions, including vision, immune response, and cellular differentiation. The protein encoded by LRATD2 is typically localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, a cellular organelle where lipid processing occurs. The activity of LRATD2 in the endoplasmic reticulum suggests its involvement in the synthesis and storage of retinyl esters, which are vital for maintaining adequate levels of vitamin A in the body. By facilitating the conversion of retinol to retinyl esters, LRATD2 plays a significant role in ensuring the availability of vitamin A derivatives necessary for the proper functioning of photoreceptor cells in the retina, thereby impacting visual processes. Additionally, the retinyl esters produced are crucial for modulating immune function and promoting cellular differentiation, highlighting the gene's importance in maintaining overall cellular and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
The LRATD2 gene, also known as FAM84B, has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression and interactions. In prostate cancer, LRATD2 is upregulated and promotes cancer progression through the FAM84B/CDKN1B/MYC/WWP1 axis, facilitating the degradation of CDKN1B and enhancing MYC expression, which accelerates cancer progression (Jin2024Extrachromosomal). It is also associated with poor prognosis in breast and prostate cancers, as well as esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, where its upregulation is linked to increased cancer cell proliferation and invasion (Gu2020The).

In the context of neuroendocrine neoplasms, LRATD2 is noted to have alterations in a significant portion of cases, suggesting its role as a potential driver gene in these cancers (van2021The). The gene is also involved in the Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) mechanism, which some cancer cells use to maintain telomere length, indicating its potential role in telomere maintenance and cancer progression (ArmendárizCastillo2020TCGA).

Overall, alterations in LRATD2 expression and function are associated with cancer progression and poor prognosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in oncology. However, specific diseases directly resulting from mutations in LRATD2 are not well-documented, necessitating further research to fully understand its clinical significance.

## Interactions
LRATD2, also known as FAM84B, is implicated in various protein interactions, particularly in the context of cancer progression. In prostate cancer, LRATD2 is carried by extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) and is upregulated, promoting cancer progression through the FAM84B/CDKN1B/MYC/WWP1 axis. This involves interactions where LRATD2 influences the transcription of WWP1 via MYC, leading to the degradation of CDKN1B, a protein that normally represses MYC expression. This interaction accelerates prostate cancer growth and metastasis (Jin2024Extrachromosomal).

In breast cancer, LRATD2 is associated with poor prognosis and is positively correlated with GNPNAT1, a gene involved in cancer stemness. Although specific protein interactions involving LRATD2 in breast cancer are not detailed, its association with GNPNAT1 suggests a role in cancer progression (Hu2023GNPNAT1).

In endothelial cells, LRATD2 is part of a protein module that shows a high correlation with the Von Willebrand factor (VWF), suggesting a potential novel interaction or association that has not been previously documented (Groten2024The). These interactions highlight LRATD2's involvement in complex cellular processes and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.
