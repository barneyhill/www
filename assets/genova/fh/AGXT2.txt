# AGXT2

## Overview
The AGXT2 gene encodes the enzyme alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase 2, a mitochondrial aminotransferase primarily expressed in the kidney and liver. This enzyme plays a critical role in the metabolism of various compounds, including asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA), which are known inhibitors of nitric oxide production, thereby influencing cardiovascular health (Jarzebska2019Kidney; Rodionov2010Human). AGXT2 also participates in the metabolism of beta-alanine and homoarginine, impacting energy metabolism and cardiovascular risk factors, respectively (Jarzebska2019Kidney; Rodionov2016A). Variants in the AGXT2 gene have been associated with conditions such as hypertension and atrial fibrillation, highlighting its clinical significance in cardiovascular disease (Caplin2012AlanineGlyoxylate; Seppälä2016Associations).

## Function
The AGXT2 gene encodes the enzyme alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase 2, which is primarily expressed in the mitochondria of kidney and liver cells (Jarzebska2019Kidney; Rodionov2010Human). This enzyme is involved in the metabolism of several cardiovascular risk factors, including asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA), which are inhibitors of nitric oxide (NO) production (Hu2017AGXT2:; Rodionov2014AGXT2:). AGXT2 catalyzes the transamination of ADMA to α-keto-δ-(N,N-dimethylguanidino)valeric acid (DMGV), thereby reducing ADMA levels and supporting NO production, which is crucial for endothelial function and vascular homeostasis (Caplin2012AlanineGlyoxylate; Rodionov2010Human).

AGXT2 also plays a role in energy metabolism by metabolizing beta-alanine, a precursor of the antioxidant dipeptide carnosine, which provides protection from end organ damage in metabolic syndrome models (Jarzebska2019Kidney). Additionally, AGXT2 is involved in the metabolism of homoarginine, a protective cardiovascular factor, and its activity influences systemic levels of this compound, potentially impacting cardiovascular health (Rodionov2016A). The enzyme's broad substrate specificity and mitochondrial localization underscore its versatile role in cellular metabolism (Rodionov2014AGXT2:).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the AGXT2 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, particularly those affecting cardiovascular health. Variants such as rs37369 and rs16899974 are associated with altered metabolism of methylarginines, which are inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase. This disruption can lead to elevated levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA), contributing to hypertension and cardiovascular diseases (Caplin2012AlanineGlyoxylate; Kittel2014Alanineglyoxylate). 

The rs16899974 variant has been associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) and ischemic stroke, particularly in patients without structural heart disease. This variant is linked to both paroxysmal and chronic AF, as well as an earlier age of onset for ischemic stroke (Seppälä2016Associations). 

AGXT2 also plays a role in the metabolism of homoarginine, a cardiovascular risk factor. Deficiency in AGXT2 can lead to elevated homoarginine levels, which are associated with cardiovascular diseases and mild hypertension (Rodionov2016A). These findings suggest that AGXT2 is crucial in maintaining cardiovascular health through its role in methylarginine and homoarginine metabolism.
