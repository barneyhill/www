# PRR23D2

## Overview
PRR23D2 is a human gene that encodes the protein proline rich 23 domain containing 2. This protein is characterized by its proline-rich domain, which suggests a potential role in protein-protein interactions, although its specific biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. The PRR23D2 gene is part of a larger family of genes that share similar structural motifs, indicating a possible conserved function across different species. While the precise cellular and physiological roles of the PRR23D2 protein are not yet well-defined, it is hypothesized to be involved in various signaling pathways due to its structural properties. Further research is needed to clarify its interactions and potential implications in human health and disease.
