# PLCH1

## Overview
PLCH1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme phospholipase C eta 1, a member of the phospholipase C family, which plays a pivotal role in intracellular signal transduction. This enzyme is involved in the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to produce inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), both of which serve as secondary messengers in various cellular processes, including calcium signaling and neuronal activity. Phospholipase C eta 1 is predominantly expressed in the brain and lungs, where it influences neurodevelopment and synaptic plasticity, as well as respiratory functions. The protein's structure includes several conserved domains, such as the pleckstrin homology domain and EF-hand motifs, which are essential for its enzymatic activity and subcellular localization. Mutations in the PLCH1 gene have been linked to developmental disorders, such as holoprosencephaly, due to altered protein localization and function (Drissi2021Mutations; Zhang2023Superposition).

## Structure
The PLCH1 gene encodes the phospholipase C eta-1 protein, which is a member of the phospholipase C family involved in intracellular signal transduction. The molecular structure of PLCH1 includes several conserved domains that are crucial for its function. These domains include the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, EF-hand motifs, and a catalytic domain, which collectively facilitate the protein's ability to bind phosphoinositides and calcium ions, thereby enabling its enzymatic activity (Drissi2021Mutations).

PLCH1 is known to have three isoforms, with the study by Drissi et al. focusing on the most common and longest transcript, NM_001130960 (Drissi2021Mutations). The protein also contains a predicted nuclear localization signal and a nuclear export signal, which are important for its subcellular localization. Mutations in PLCH1 can alter its localization, as observed in certain variants that show increased nuclear presence, suggesting a role in nuclear-cytoplasmic transport (Drissi2021Mutations).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate the function of PLCH1, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context. The study did not provide detailed information on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of the protein.

## Function
PLCH1 (phospholipase C eta 1) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in intracellular signal transduction by hydrolyzing phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to generate inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). These molecules act as secondary messengers in various cellular processes, including calcium signaling and neuronal activity. PLCH1 is primarily active in the brain, where it influences neurodevelopment and synaptic plasticity (Drissi2021Mutations).

The enzyme is involved in the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathway, which regulates neuroexcitability in the brain and the endocrine system through intracellular Ca2+ dynamics and protein kinase C activation (Zhang2023Superposition). PLCH1 is expressed at high levels in brain and lung tissues, particularly in nerve fibers, respiratory ciliated cells, and alveolar type 2 cells, indicating its significant role in these tissues (Zhang2023Superposition).

In healthy human cells, PLCH1 is typically localized in the cytoplasm, and its proper localization is crucial for normal development. Mislocalization, particularly nuclear localization, has been associated with developmental disorders, highlighting the importance of its cytoplasmic activity (Drissi2021Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PLCH1 gene have been associated with holoprosencephaly, a severe developmental disorder characterized by brain malformations. This condition is marked by the incomplete separation of the prosencephalon into two cerebral hemispheres, leading to a spectrum of brain and facial anomalies. In particular, two families were identified with children exhibiting severe developmental delays due to holoprosencephaly, where no known causes were identified except for homozygous, rare, predicted deleterious variants in the PLCH1 gene (Drissi2021Mutations). 

The study found specific mutations, such as a homozygous nonsense variant c.2065C>T leading to a premature stop codon, and a homozygous one base deletion c.3235delT causing a frameshift and truncated protein. These mutations were linked to altered subcellular localization of the PLCH1 protein, which was predominantly nuclear in the mutant form, suggesting a potential pathogenic mechanism involving loss of the C-terminal domain and reduced protein availability at critical sites (Drissi2021Mutations). 

Additionally, PLCH1 has been implicated in adaptation to extreme high-altitude environments, where changes in its methylation may influence neural excitation and physiological adaptation processes (Zhang2023Superposition).
