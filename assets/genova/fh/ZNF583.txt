# ZNF583

## Overview
ZNF583 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 583, which is part of the zinc finger protein family known for their role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which facilitate their interaction with DNA, RNA, or other proteins, thereby influencing gene expression and cellular processes. The zinc finger protein 583 is implicated in various cellular functions, including the regulation of gene expression related to cell growth and differentiation. Alterations in the expression and methylation patterns of ZNF583 have been associated with several types of cancer, suggesting its potential role as a tumor suppressor or oncogene, depending on the context (Zhong2023Singlecell; Mori2011Novel).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
ZNF583 has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression and methylation patterns. In osteosarcoma, ZNF583 is downregulated compared to normal osteoblast cells, suggesting its potential role as a novel anti-oncogene. This downregulation is associated with a lower risk score and higher immune cell populations, indicating potential benefits from immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment (Zhong2023Singlecell). The gene is also part of a prognostic signature for osteosarcoma, where its expression levels correlate with patient survival outcomes (Zhong2023Singlecell).

In colorectal cancer, ZNF583 is frequently hypermethylated, distinguishing cancerous tissues from non-cancerous ones. This hypermethylation is associated with colonic neoplastic progression and may serve as a biomarker for early-stage disease detection and risk stratification (Mori2011Novel). Similarly, in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma, ZNF583 is identified among the top differentially methylated regions, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic marker (Patel2023Plasma).

ZNF583's methylation status is also relevant in anal intraepithelial neoplasia and anal squamous cell carcinoma, although it is not the top performer in diagnostic metrics (van2018Host). These findings highlight ZNF583's clinical significance in cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
