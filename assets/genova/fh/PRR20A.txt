# PRR20A

## Overview
PRR20A is a gene that encodes the proline-rich protein 20A, which is characterized by its abundance of proline residues. This protein is implicated in the regulation of protein degradation processes within the cell. As a proline-rich protein, PRR20A is thought to play a role in facilitating targeted protein degradation, potentially through interactions with E3 ligases or other factors that recognize degron sequences. Such interactions may enable PRR20A to mediate the degradation of specific protein targets, either directly or indirectly, by recruiting necessary components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Poirson2022Proteome-scale). Additionally, PRR20A has been associated with immune regulation, as it interacts with FOXP3, a critical transcription factor in CD4+ T cells (Li2015A). The protein's ability to cause collateral degradation of proximal targets further underscores its potential significance in cellular protein homeostasis (Poirson2022Proteome-scale).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
PRR20A, a proline-rich protein, has been identified as a potent degrader in proteome-scale screens, suggesting it may interact with other proteins to facilitate targeted protein degradation. It is hypothesized that PRR20A functions indirectly by recruiting an E3 ligase or another factor through a degron sequence, similar to the mechanism observed with EID1, another unstructured protein that binds the E3 ligase adaptor FBXO21 (Poirson2022Proteome-scale). The study by Poirson et al. also highlights PRR20A's ability to cause collateral degradation of a proximal target when part of a different polypeptide chain, indicating a potential for trans-acting interactions (Poirson2022Proteome-scale).

In addition to its role in protein degradation, PRR20A has been noted to interact with FOXP3, a master gene involved in CD4+ T cells, as identified in the STRING database (Li2015A). This interaction suggests a possible involvement in immune regulation or signaling pathways. The study by Hermanns et al. also mentions PRR20A as a protein with strong degrons, likely mediating targeted protein degradation in an indirect manner (Hermanns2024Proximitydependent).
