# GNAI3

## Overview
GNAI3 is a gene that encodes the G protein subunit alpha i3, a member of the Gαi subfamily of G proteins, which are pivotal in intracellular signaling pathways. The protein encoded by GNAI3 is involved in GDP/GTP binding and plays a significant role in regulating various signaling pathways that influence cellular responses to external stimuli, such as proliferation and apoptosis (Romanelli2014Novel). Structurally, the GNAI3 protein features a nucleotide-binding domain with GTPase activity and an α-helical domain, which are essential for its function in signal transduction (Fonin2019Multifunctionality). GNAI3 is implicated in several developmental pathways, including the EDN1-EDNRA-DLX pathway, which is crucial for skeletal and inner ear development (Romanelli2014Novel). Mutations in GNAI3 are associated with auriculocondylar syndrome, a condition characterized by craniofacial malformations, highlighting its clinical significance (Rieder2012A; Liu2021Prenatal).

## Structure
The GNAI3 protein, part of the human Gαi family, exhibits a disorder profile similar to other Gαi subunits, with a predicted disorder rate of 24.9%. It contains a long N-terminal intrinsically disordered protein region (IDPR) and multiple post-translational modification (PTM) sites (Fonin2019Multifunctionality). The protein has a nucleotide-binding domain, known as the Ras-like domain, which possesses GTPase activity, and an α-helical domain (α-H domain). The α-H domain partially occludes the bound nucleotide, necessitating partial opening for nucleotide release. Structural rearrangements occur in three segments, switches I-III, which are loops between α-helices sensitive to guanine nucleotides. Switch I undergoes GTPγS-dependent conformational change, while switches II and III transition from disorder to order upon GTPγS binding (Fonin2019Multifunctionality).

GNAI3 is involved in GDP/GTP binding, facilitated by five small motifs known as the G1-G5 boxes. Variants affecting residues Gly45, Thr48, and Asn269, which are highly conserved, can disrupt GDP/GTP binding (Romanelli2014Novel). The protein also has multiple alternatively spliced isoforms with variations in the N-terminal regions or modified C-tails (Fonin2019Multifunctionality).

## Function
The GNAI3 gene encodes the G protein subunit alpha i3, which is a part of the Gαi subfamily of G proteins involved in intracellular signaling pathways. This protein plays a crucial role in GDP/GTP binding and is involved in the regulation of various signaling pathways that control cellular responses to external stimuli (Romanelli2014Novel). In healthy human cells, GNAI3 is expected to function properly in GDP/GTP binding, contributing to the regulation of signaling pathways that affect cellular functions such as proliferation and apoptosis (Romanelli2014Novel).

GNAI3 is involved in the EDN1-EDNRA-DLX pathway, which is significant for the development of skeletal elements and the inner ear (Romanelli2014Novel). It is also implicated in the regulation of the JNK and ERK signaling pathways, which are crucial for cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation (Zhang2018Guanine). The protein is active in various cellular locations, including the plasma membrane, and influences processes like cell division, differentiation, and signal transduction, impacting organismal development and function (Zhang2018Guanine).

GNAI3's role in promoting differentiation is linked to its involvement in the odonto/osteogenic differentiation of stem cells from the apical papilla, which is crucial for tooth root development (Zhang2018Guanine). It is also associated with auriculocondylar syndrome, where variants in the gene can lead to disruptions in GDP/GTP binding, resulting in dominant negative effects (Romanelli2014Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GNAI3 gene are associated with auriculocondylar syndrome (ACS), a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by craniofacial malformations such as micrognathia, mandibular condyle hypoplasia, and auricular abnormalities (Rieder2012A; Liu2021Prenatal). Specific mutations, such as Gly40Arg and Ser47Asn, have been identified as contributing to ACS. The Gly40Arg mutation is considered a gain-of-function mutation, while the Ser47Asn mutation is suggested to have a dominant negative effect, disrupting normal G protein signaling (Clouthier2013Understanding; Liu2021Prenatal).

These mutations interfere with the guanine nucleotide-binding function of the GNAI3 protein, which is crucial for its role in the endothelin-DLX5/6 pathway involved in mandibular development (Romanelli2014Novel; Rieder2012A). The disruption of this pathway can lead to a homeotic transformation where the mandible takes on characteristics of the maxilla, contributing to the craniofacial abnormalities observed in ACS (Rieder2012A).

In addition to craniofacial defects, GNAI3 mutations may also lead to hearing loss due to their impact on the development of skeletal elements and the inner ear (Romanelli2014Novel). The condition shows variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance, with more severe cases often observed in females (Liu2021Prenatal).

## Interactions
GNAI3, a G protein subunit alpha i3, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in signal transduction. It forms part of the heterotrimeric G-protein complex, interacting with Gβ and Gγ subunits to mediate signaling pathways. The GNAI3 protein interacts with proteins such as Plcb1, Plcb2, Plcb3, and other G family proteins like Gnb1, Gnb2, Gnb3, Gnb4, Gng2, Gng4, and Gpsm1, as identified through the STRING database (MISHRA2020An). 

GNAI3 also plays a role in the regulation of melanosomal protein trafficking, interacting with the OA1 protein, a G-protein coupled receptor, which is crucial for melanosomal biogenesis and axonal guidance (Young2016GNAI3:). Specific mutations in GNAI3, such as V109F and V109G, affect its ability to fit into binding pockets, highlighting the importance of its structural interactions (Young2016GNAI3:).

In cellular signaling, GNAI3 is involved in recruiting the docking protein Gab1 to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is essential for activating downstream AKT signaling. This interaction is reduced in GNAI3 knockout cells, indicating its role in modulating growth-factor signaling (Nůsková2021Stearic).
