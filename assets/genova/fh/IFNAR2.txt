# IFNAR2

## Overview
The IFNAR2 gene encodes the interferon alpha and beta receptor subunit 2, a critical component of the type I interferon receptor complex. This gene plays a pivotal role in the immune response by encoding a transmembrane receptor protein that facilitates the binding of type I interferons, such as IFN-α and IFN-β, to initiate downstream signaling pathways. The IFNAR2 protein is integral to the activation of the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway, which is essential for antiviral defense and regulation of immune responses (Duncan2015Human; Platanias2005Mechanisms). The protein exists in multiple isoforms, including a long transmembrane form and a soluble form, each contributing differently to immune modulation (de2007Type; de2012The). Mutations and polymorphisms in the IFNAR2 gene have been linked to various diseases, highlighting its significance in maintaining immune homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target (de2020Structural; Razavi2024Evaluation).

## Structure
The IFNAR2 protein is a key component of the type I interferon receptor complex, characterized by its extracellular domain (ECD) composed of two fibronectin type III (FNIII) domains connected by a rigid hinge region (Pan2008Mutation; Akabayov2010NMR). The ECD is responsible for high-affinity binding to interferons, with critical interactions involving residues from the A helix, AB loop, and E helix (Walter2020The; Pan2008Mutation). The binding site on IFNAR2-EC is characterized by a hydrophobic patch flanked by polar residues, with key contributions from the β3-β4 loop, β5-β6 loop, and the hinge region (Akabayov2010NMR).

Mutational analyses have identified several binding hotspots, including residues M48, T46, and I47, which form a hydrophobic patch crucial for interaction with interferons (Piehler1999Mutational). The IFNAR2 protein undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which may influence its function and localization. Multiple splice variants of IFNAR2 exist, potentially affecting its structural and functional properties (Pan2008Mutation). The quaternary structure involves the formation of a receptor complex with IFNAR1, which is essential for signal transduction and antiviral response (Walter2020The).

## Function
The IFNAR2 gene encodes a subunit of the type I interferon receptor complex, which is crucial for mediating cellular responses to type I interferons (IFNs), including IFN-α and IFN-β. In healthy human cells, IFNAR2 forms a heterodimer with IFNAR1, facilitating the binding of type I IFNs and initiating a signaling cascade through the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway (Duncan2015Human; Platanias2005Mechanisms). This process involves the phosphorylation of JAK1 and TYK2 kinases, which subsequently phosphorylate STAT1 and STAT2. These phosphorylated STAT proteins associate with IRF9 to form the ISGF3 complex, which translocates to the nucleus to activate the transcription of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) (Walter2020The; Duncan2015Human).

The IFNAR2 protein exists in multiple isoforms, including a long transmembrane form (IFNAR2c) that is essential for complete antiviral responses, and a soluble form (sIFNAR2a) that can modulate signaling by acting as either an agonist or antagonist (de2007Type; de2012The). These isoforms contribute to the regulation of immune responses, antiviral defense, and cell growth, highlighting the critical role of IFNAR2 in maintaining cellular homeostasis and organismal health (Walter2020The; de2007Type).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IFNAR2 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions due to its critical role in immune response. A homozygous mutation in IFNAR2, specifically a single-base deletion in exon 5 (c.A311del), leads to a frameshift and premature stop codon, resulting in a complete failure of IFN-α/β signaling. This mutation has been linked to severe innate antiviral immunodeficiency, as evidenced by a fatal case of encephalitis following MMR vaccination in a child with this mutation (Duncan2015Human). 

In the context of COVID-19, reduced expression of IFNAR2 has been associated with increased severity of the disease. Genetic variants at the IFNAR2 locus have been linked to COVID-19 severity, with lower levels of soluble IFNAR2 observed in non-survivors (Razavi2024Association; Razavi2024Evaluation). 

Additionally, polymorphisms in IFNAR2, such as rs2229207 and rs1051393, are associated with various conditions, including multiple sclerosis, hepatitis B and C infections, and severe pain in lung cancer patients. These polymorphisms result in nonsynonymous mutations that may affect the protein's function and expression (de2020Structural). 

Overall, IFNAR2 mutations and expression alterations can significantly impact immune responses, leading to increased susceptibility to infections and other immune-related conditions.

## Interactions
IFNAR2 is a critical component of the type I interferon receptor complex, which interacts with type I interferons such as IFNα2 and IFNβ. It forms a receptor complex with IFNAR1, facilitating the activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. IFNAR2 binds interferon ligands with higher affinity than IFNAR1, allowing it to form a binary complex with the ligand. However, signaling is only initiated when IFNAR1 is recruited to form a ternary complex (Li2008The).

The interaction between IFNAR2 and IFNα2 involves a hydrophobic patch on IFNα2, which overlaps with the IFNAR2 binding site. This hydrophobic interaction is crucial for stabilizing the complex, while electrostatic forces, particularly from Arg and Lys residues on IFNα2, facilitate fast binding with IFNAR2 (Piehler2000New). Specific residues on IFNAR2, such as T46, I47, and M48, are identified as hot-spots for interaction with IFNα2 (Piehler1999Mutational).

The binding of IFNα2 to IFNAR2 is described as a rate-limiting step in activating biological responses, with a linear correlation between binding affinity and anti-viral/anti-proliferative activities (Piehler2000New). The study of these interactions provides insights into the structural organization and functional dynamics of the IFNα2-IFNAR1-IFNAR2 complex (Li2008The).
