# MAMDC4

## Overview
MAMDC4 is a gene that encodes the MAM domain containing 4 protein, which is a single-pass transmembrane protein involved in critical cellular signaling pathways. This protein plays a significant role in the regulation of transcriptional co-factors YAP and β-catenin, which are essential for the proliferation and differentiation of intestinal stem cells. MAMDC4 is integral to maintaining intestinal epithelium homeostasis by mediating interactions between YAP and β-catenin through a non-canonical pathway involving the AMOT protein. The protein's structure includes a large extracellular domain and a 40 amino acid cytoplasmic domain, which are crucial for its function in signaling pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin and YAP signaling. MAMDC4's interactions with components of the Wnt signalosome and its influence on YAP localization underscore its role in modulating key cellular processes. Mutations in the MAMDC4 gene have been linked to familial axial spondyloarthritis, highlighting its clinical significance in autoimmune disease susceptibility (O’Rielly2015Private; Cox2024Regulation).

## Function
The MAMDC4 gene encodes an integral membrane protein that plays a crucial role in regulating the activity of transcriptional co-factors YAP and β-catenin, which are essential for the proliferation and differentiation of intestinal stem cells. MAMDC4 is involved in maintaining intestinal epithelium homeostasis by mediating cross-talk between YAP and β-catenin through a non-canonical pathway involving the AMOT protein, part of the signalosome complex (Cox2024Regulation). 

MAMDC4 is a single-pass transmembrane protein with a large extracellular domain and a 40 amino acid cytoplasmic domain. It mediates both YAP and β-catenin nuclear localization and signaling. Overexpression of MAMDC4 results in increased levels of YAP protein and enhanced Wnt signaling, while its knockout decreases these pathways. The cytoplasmic domain is crucial for its role in increasing Wnt signaling, and the extracellular domain may modulate interaction with Wnt ligand or prevent the FZD/LRP6 interaction (Cox2024Regulation).

MAMDC4 also influences the interaction between YAP, β-catenin, and AMOT, suggesting a model where MAMDC4 promotes signaling through competition for binding with AMOT in an endosomal compartment. This interaction impacts the signaling pathways crucial for cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation (Cox2024Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MAMDC4 gene have been implicated in the pathogenesis of familial axial spondyloarthritis (AxSpA). A specific out-of-frame deletion in MAMDC4 results in a premature termination codon, leading to a truncated protein that is likely degraded by nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD). This deletion is associated with a significant reduction in the protein's functional capacity, potentially contributing to disease susceptibility (O’Rielly2015Private). The study by O’Rielly et al. suggests that the MAMDC4 deletion, when present alongside the HLA-B*27 allele, may lead to an earlier onset of AxSpA symptoms in affected individuals (O’Rielly2015Private).

The pathogenic role of MAMDC4 in AxSpA is further supported by its paralog, MAMDC1, being a candidate gene for systemic lupus erythematosus, indicating a possible shared pathway in autoimmune diseases (O’Rielly2015Private). The rarity of the MAMDC4 deletion in public datasets suggests it may be a private variant within specific families, highlighting the importance of rare genetic variants in the heritability of AxSpA (O’Rielly2015Private). These findings underscore the potential clinical significance of MAMDC4 mutations in contributing to the genetic basis of AxSpA.

## Interactions
MAMDC4, a protein encoded by the MAM domain containing 4 gene, is involved in several interactions with key components of cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with components of the Wnt signalosome, including LRP6, p-LRP6, Axin1, DVL2, and β-catenin. These interactions are significant for the regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, with a notable enrichment of LRP6 and p-LRP6, which occurs independently of ligand presence (Cox2024Regulation). MAMDC4 also influences the localization and interaction of β-catenin and YAP with membrane-associated proteins AMOT and AMOTL2. Overexpression of MAMDC4 reduces the co-immunoprecipitation of β-catenin and YAP with AMOT, suggesting competitive binding (Cox2024Regulation).

MAMDC4's role extends to the modulation of YAP signaling, where it affects the nuclear localization of YAP independently of the Hippo pathway. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of intestinal stem cell function and proliferation (Cox2024Regulation). The protein's cytoplasmic domain is essential for mediating these interactions, as mutations in specific amino acids can alter its localization and function in signaling pathways (Cox2024Regulation). These interactions highlight MAMDC4's role in modulating key signaling pathways through its involvement in endocytosis and receptor trafficking.
