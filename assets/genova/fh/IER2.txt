# IER2

## Overview
The IER2 gene encodes the immediate early response 2 protein, which functions primarily as a transcription factor or transcriptional co-activator involved in various cellular processes. This protein is characterized by its rich composition of proline, serine, and arginine, and it contains nuclear localization signals that facilitate its role as a nuclear protein. IER2 is implicated in the regulation of endothelial cell functions, particularly in angiogenesis, through mechanisms involving focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling pathways. It undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which are crucial for its activity and interactions with other proteins, including protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and CDC25A. IER2's interactions extend to roles in cancer biology, where it is associated with metastasis and poor prognosis in various cancers, including colorectal cancer. Its involvement in cellular signaling pathways and potential as a prognostic biomarker underscores its significance in both physiological and pathological contexts (WU2015Identification; Ueda2019IER; Alberto2024Synergism).

## Structure
The IER2 protein consists of 223 amino acids and is rich in proline, serine, and arginine, suggesting potential structural and functional roles (WU2015Identification). It contains two putative nuclear localization signals, indicating its role as a nuclear protein (WU2015Identification). The protein shares a high degree of similarity with its mouse homolog, pip92, with 76% of the amino acid residues being identical (WU2015Identification).

IER2 is characterized by multiple phosphorylation sites, suggesting it undergoes post-translational modifications that may influence its function as a transcription factor or transcriptional co-activator (WU2015Identification). The protein is predicted to have four probable SH3 ligand domains, which are indicative of potential SH3-mediated protein interactions, particularly with MACC1 in the context of colorectal cancer (Alberto2024Synergism).

While specific details on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of IER2 are not provided, its interactions with other proteins, such as fibroblast growth factor intracellular binding protein 1, suggest a complex role in cellular signaling pathways (Hong2009FGFdependent). The protein's involvement in various cellular processes, including cell motility and angiogenesis, further underscores its functional significance (WU2015Identification).

## Function
The IER2 gene encodes a protein that functions as a transcription factor or transcriptional co-activator, playing a crucial role in regulating cellular responses to various stimuli. In healthy human cells, IER2 is involved in the regulation of endothelial cell functions, particularly in angiogenesis, by modulating cell motility, adhesion, and differentiation into capillary-like structures. This is achieved through a focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-dependent mechanism, where IER2 influences the phosphorylation of FAK at Y397, essential for activating the FAK-mediated signaling pathway (WU2015Identification).

IER2 is constitutively expressed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and is rapidly upregulated by extracellular stimuli such as growth factors and cytokines. It contains nuclear localization signals and multiple phosphorylation sites, indicating its role as a nuclear protein requiring post-translational modifications (WU2015Identification). IER2 also interacts with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), modulating the phosphorylation status of various proteins, including CDC25A, which is involved in cell cycle regulation (Ueda2019IER). Through these interactions, IER2 influences cell proliferation, motility, and adhesion, contributing to processes like angiogenesis and cellular stress responses (WU2015Identification; Alberto2024Synergism).

## Clinical Significance
IER2 is implicated in various cancers, notably colorectal cancer, where its expression is associated with metastasis and poor prognosis. High IER2 expression correlates with reduced survival rates in colorectal cancer patients, particularly when co-expressed with MACC1, another gene linked to cancer progression (Alberto2024Synergism). IER2 promotes metastasis in pancreatic tumor cells and is linked to overall survival in colorectal cancer patients (Alberto2024Synergism). In hepatocellular carcinoma, IER2 enhances cell adhesion, spreading, and motility, contributing to metastatic potential (Alberto2024Synergism). In melanoma, elevated IER2 levels lead to the accumulation of an MDM2 isoform, stabilization of p53, and induction of senescence, which is associated with a poor prognosis (Alberto2024Synergism).

IER2's role in cancer involves its interaction with protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A), enhancing its activity and affecting the dephosphorylation of proteins involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis (Alberto2024Synergism). It also regulates the cell cycle, particularly the G1-S transition, through interaction with CDC25A, mediated by the 14-3-3 protein (Alberto2024Synergism). These interactions highlight IER2's potential as a prognostic biomarker and a target for therapeutic strategies in cancer treatment (Alberto2024Synergism).

## Interactions
IER2 (Immediate Early Response 2) is involved in several protein-protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular signaling pathways. IER2 interacts with Fibp1, a nuclear FGF binding protein, in the context of FGF signaling in zebrafish. This interaction is crucial for embryonic development, affecting cell movements and axis formation (Hong2009FGFdependent). 

IER2 also interacts with various subunits of protein phosphatase PP2A, specifically binding to the B55 subunits (α, β, γ, and δ) and the PP2A catalytic subunit (PP2AC). This interaction is important for modulating the phosphorylation status of target proteins, such as CDC25A, by promoting its dephosphorylation (Ueda2019IER). IER2 binds to the C-terminal catalytic domain of CDC25A, shifting it to hypophosphorylated forms and affecting its interaction with 14-3-3 proteins (Ueda2019IER).

In the context of cancer, IER2 interacts with MACC1 in colorectal cancer cells, where overexpression of MACC1 leads to increased IER2 expression. This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays (Alberto2024Synergism). IER2 also regulates cell adhesion and motility in hepatocellular carcinoma cells through the integrin β1-mediated signaling pathway, influencing the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Src, and paxillin (Xu2016Immediate).
