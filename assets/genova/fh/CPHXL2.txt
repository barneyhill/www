# CPHXL2

## Overview
The CPHXL2 gene encodes the protein cytoplasmic polyadenylated homeobox like 2, which is involved in various cellular processes. This protein is categorized as a transcription factor, playing a crucial role in regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. The CPHXL2 protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, where it participates in the modulation of mRNA stability and translation, impacting cellular differentiation and development. Its function is essential for maintaining normal cellular homeostasis and has been implicated in several signaling pathways, including the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway (Qiu2020aarFDC). Understanding the precise mechanisms of CPHXL2 and its interactions with other cellular components remains an active area of research, with significant implications for developmental biology and disease pathogenesis.
