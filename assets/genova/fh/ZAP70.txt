# ZAP70

## Overview
ZAP70 is a gene that encodes the zeta chain of T cell receptor-associated protein kinase 70, a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase that plays a pivotal role in T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. This kinase is essential for the development and function of T cells, as it transduces signals from the TCR complex upon antigen recognition. The protein structure of ZAP-70 includes two Src homology 2 (SH2) domains and a kinase domain, which are crucial for its activation and function. Upon TCR engagement, ZAP-70 is recruited to phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) on the TCR complex, where it becomes activated and phosphorylates downstream signaling molecules, facilitating various signaling pathways critical for T cell activation and differentiation (AuYeung2018ZAP70). Mutations in the ZAP70 gene can lead to severe immunodeficiencies and autoimmune disorders, underscoring its importance in immune system regulation (Sharifinejad2020Clinical; AuYeung2018ZAP70).

## Structure
ZAP70 is a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase crucial for T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling. Its molecular structure includes several key domains: two N-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, a kinase domain, and linkers connecting these regions. The SH2 domains form a tightly coupled module, connected by a coiled-coil segment known as interdomain A, and are linked to the kinase domain by a flexible linker called interdomain B or the SH2-kinase linker (Yan2013Structural). 

In its inactive state, ZAP70 is autoinhibited by a network of hydrogen bonds that restrict the mobility of the kinase domain's hinge region. This autoinhibition is maintained by interactions between specific residues, such as Pro147 in the inter-SH2 linker, which interacts with Tyr597 and Tyr598 in the kinase domain (Au‐Yeung2009The). Upon activation, the SH2 domains undergo conformational changes, moving closer together and causing a reorientation of helices, which destabilizes the linker-kinase sandwich and allows access to regulatory tyrosine phosphorylation sites (Au‐Yeung2009The).

Phosphorylation is a common post-translational modification of ZAP70, with key phosphorylation sites including Tyr315, Tyr319, Tyr492, and Tyr493. These modifications are crucial for the activation and regulation of the kinase activity (Yan2013Structural; Huber2015The). The phosphorylation of these residues facilitates the transition from inactive to active conformations, essential for TCR signaling (Yan2013Structural).

## Function
ZAP-70 is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that plays a crucial role in T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, essential for T cell development and function. Upon TCR activation, ZAP-70 is recruited to phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) on the TCR complex, where it is activated by the Src family kinase Lck. This activation leads to the phosphorylation of substrates such as LAT and SLP-76, facilitating the assembly of multiprotein complexes that promote downstream signaling pathways, including the Ras-MAPK pathway, inositol phospholipid pathway, and calcium release (AuYeung2018ZAP70).

ZAP-70's activity is critical for both positive and negative selection processes in the thymus, influencing the development of T cells by determining the strength of TCR signaling required for these processes (AuYeung2018ZAP70). It also plays a role in the differentiation of CD4+ T cells into effector cells, necessary for cytokine production and cytolytic activity (AuYeung2018ZAP70). ZAP-70's noncatalytic functions include acting as a scaffold phosphoprotein, facilitating inside-out signaling that enhances cellular adhesion through integrin LFA-1 (AuYeung2018ZAP70). Its dysregulation can lead to immunodeficiency or autoimmunity, highlighting its importance in maintaining immune homeostasis (AuYeung2018ZAP70).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZAP70 gene can lead to severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), characterized by a lack of functional CD8+ T cells and non-functional CD4+ T cells. This condition results in recurrent, life-threatening infections early in life and often requires hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for survival (AuYeung2018ZAP70; Elder2001Distinct). ZAP-70 deficiency is caused by recessive homozygous or compound heterozygous loss-of-function mutations, often located in the kinase domain of the gene, leading to loss of protein expression (Sharifinejad2020Clinical; AuYeung2018ZAP70).

In addition to SCID, ZAP-70 mutations are associated with autoimmune conditions. Some mutations can lead to a severe autoimmune syndrome, characterized by conditions such as bullous pemphigoid and colitis, due to increased TCR-induced signaling (AuYeung2018ZAP70). Hypomorphic mutations in ZAP70 can result in a milder immunodeficiency with late-onset symptoms and no autoimmunity, due to low-level expression of wild-type ZAP-70 through alternative splicing (Picard2009Hypomorphic).

ZAP-70 deficiency can also present with immune dysregulation, including lymphoproliferative disorders and an increased risk of malignancies (Sharifinejad2020Clinical). The clinical presentation of ZAP-70 deficiency is heterogeneous, with symptoms typically appearing before the age of two (Turul2008Clinical).

## Interactions
ZAP70 is a protein tyrosine kinase that plays a crucial role in T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling by interacting with various proteins. It binds to the phosphorylated TCR ζ chain, enhancing its autophosphorylation and creating binding sites for SH2 domain-containing proteins such as abl, fyn, ras-GAP, and lck (Neumeister1995Binding). ZAP70's interaction with the TCR is facilitated by its SH2 domains, which are necessary for binding to phosphorylated T-cell receptor activation motifs (TAMs) (Timson1994Interactions).

ZAP70 also interacts with PKCθ, a kinase involved in T-cell signaling. This interaction is phosphotyrosine-dependent, with Tyr 126 of ZAP70 directly binding to the C2 domain of PKCθ. Tyr 315 and Tyr 319 are indirectly involved by promoting an open conformation of ZAP70, which is essential for efficient downstream signaling, including the activation of PLCγ1, LAT, and Itk (Xie2019Phosphotyrosinedependent).

Additionally, ZAP70 associates with the adaptor protein Cbl-b, which regulates T-cell signaling through a direct interaction with Tyr 292 of ZAP70. This interaction is involved in NFAT activation, requiring both a Ca2+ signal and functional Ras (Zhang1999A). These interactions highlight ZAP70's central role in T-cell activation and immune response.
