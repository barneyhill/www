# NFKBIE

## Overview
The NFKBIE gene encodes the protein IκBε, a member of the IκB family of proteins that function as inhibitors of the NF-κB transcription factor. IκBε plays a critical role in the regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway by sequestering NF-κB dimers in the cytoplasm, thereby preventing their translocation to the nucleus and subsequent activation of target genes. This regulatory mechanism is essential for controlling immune responses, inflammation, and cell survival. IκBε is particularly important in B-cell development and function, acting as a negative regulator of NF-κB activity to maintain immune homeostasis. Mutations in the NFKBIE gene have been implicated in various B-cell malignancies and autoimmune diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Myouzen2012Functional; DellaValle2020Nfkbiedeficiency; Komissarova2008Gene).

## Structure
The NFKBIE gene encodes the protein IκBε, which functions as an inhibitor of the NF-κB transcription factor. The primary structure of IκBε is composed of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein. Its secondary structure includes motifs such as alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and function. The tertiary structure of IκBε involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is essential for its interaction with other molecules. 

IκBε contains ankyrin repeat domains, which are crucial for protein-protein interactions. These domains facilitate the binding of IκBε to NF-κB, thereby inhibiting its activity. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating the function of IκBε. These modifications can alter the protein's activity and its ability to interact with other molecules. 

Splice variants of IκBε may exist, potentially altering its structure and function. These variants can lead to differences in the protein's ability to inhibit NF-κB, affecting cellular responses. The quaternary structure of IκBε involves its participation in protein complexes, which is essential for its regulatory functions.

## Function
The NFKBIE gene encodes the protein IκBε, which is a crucial component of the NF-κB signaling pathway. In healthy human cells, IκBε functions as an inhibitor of NF-κB by sequestering NF-κB dimers in the cytoplasm, thereby preventing their translocation to the nucleus and subsequent activation of target genes (Komissarova2008Gene). This regulation is essential for controlling immune responses, inflammation, and cell survival, as NF-κB is involved in the expression of genes related to these processes (Myouzen2012Functional).

IκBε is particularly important in B-cell development and function, where it acts as a negative regulator of NF-κB activity, limiting the nuclear translocation of NF-κB dimers such as p65 and cRel. This regulation helps maintain the balance between different B-cell types and prevents excessive B-cell activation (DellaValle2020Nfkbiedeficiency). In the context of immune regulation, polymorphisms in the NFKBIE gene have been linked to autoimmune diseases, indicating its role in maintaining immune homeostasis (Myouzen2012Functional).

The protein is more expressed in IgM+ B cells than in IgG+ B cells and has a slower turnover compared to other IκB proteins, highlighting its specific regulatory role in immune cells (DellaValle2020Nfkbiedeficiency).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NFKBIE gene, which encodes the NF-κB inhibitor IκBε, have significant clinical implications, particularly in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and other B-cell malignancies. These mutations are often loss-of-function, leading to reduced levels of IκBε and increased NF-κB activity, which promotes B-cell proliferation and survival (DellaValle2020Nfkbiedeficiency). In CLL, NFKBIE mutations are associated with accelerated disease progression, poorer responses to chemotherapy, and resistance to the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib, resulting in inferior treatment outcomes (Bonato2024NFKBIE). These mutations also contribute to immune escape mechanisms by promoting the expansion of exhausted CD8+ T-cells and increasing PD-L1 expression on malignant B-cells, leading to T-cell exhaustion (Bonato2024NFKBIE).

In addition to CLL, NFKBIE mutations are found in other B-cell lymphomas, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma, where they are linked to poor prognosis and disease progression (DellaValle2020Nfkbiedeficiency). The gene's role in regulating the NF-κB pathway also implicates it in autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, where specific variants are associated with increased disease susceptibility (Myouzen2012Functional).

## Interactions
NFKBIE, also known as IκBε, is a protein that plays a crucial role in inhibiting the NF-κB transcription factor by sequestering it in the cytoplasm. It interacts with several NF-κB subunits, including RelA/p65, c-Rel, and p50, preventing their translocation to the nucleus and thereby regulating immune responses and inflammation (DellaValle2020Nfkbiedeficiency).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), NFKBIE is significantly overexpressed and interacts strongly with proteins such as RELA, REL, CHUK, IKBKG, IKBKB, and RELB. These interactions are enriched in pathways like the NF-κB signaling pathway, Shigellosis, Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infection, and the C-type lectin receptor signaling pathway (Qian2022NFKBIE; Zhang2024NFKBIE).

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), NFKBIE mutations lead to increased NF-κB activity due to decreased inhibition of the p65 subunit. This results in enhanced nuclear translocation of NF-κB dimers, contributing to the proliferation and survival of B cells (DellaValle2020Nfkbiedeficiency). The loss of IκBε enhances the transcriptional activity of NF-κB subunits, such as p65, c-Rel, and p52, particularly when stimulated through the canonical NF-κB pathway (Bonato2024NFKBIE).
