# SYT12

## Overview
The SYT12 gene encodes synaptotagmin 12, a member of the synaptotagmin family of proteins, which are integral to synaptic vesicle function and neurotransmitter release. Unlike other synaptotagmins, synaptotagmin 12 is characterized by its lack of calcium-binding capability due to the absence of conserved Ca2+ binding aspartate residues, making its role in neurotransmitter release calcium-independent (QuiñonesFrías2021Function; Maximov2006Synaptotagmin12). Synaptotagmin 12 is a transmembrane protein with two cytosolic C2 domains and is phosphorylated at serine-97 by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), which is crucial for its function in synaptic plasticity and spontaneous neurotransmitter release (KaeserWoo2013Synaptotagmin12; Maximov2006Synaptotagmin12). The protein interacts with synaptotagmin-1, modulating its interaction with SNARE complexes and influencing synaptic vesicle exocytosis (Maximov2006Synaptotagmin12). Synaptotagmin 12 is expressed in the brain and adrenal medulla and plays a significant role in synaptic maturation, connectivity changes, and presynaptic long-term potentiation, particularly in the hippocampus (KaeserWoo2013Synaptotagmin12; Maximov2006Synaptotagmin12).

## Structure
Synaptotagmin 12 (SYT12) is a synaptic vesicle phosphoprotein that plays a role in modulating neurotransmitter release. The protein is part of the synaptotagmin family and is characterized by a structure that includes a transmembrane domain and two cytosolic C2 domains, which are common features among synaptotagmins (Craxton2004Synaptotagmin; QuiñonesFrías2021Function). However, unlike other synaptotagmins, SYT12 lacks the conserved Ca2+ binding aspartate residues, indicating it does not bind calcium ions (QuiñonesFrías2021Function; Maximov2006Synaptotagmin12).

The primary structure of SYT12 includes a linker region with two potential PKA phosphorylation sites, threonine 87 (T87) and serine 97 (S97), but only S97 is functionally phosphorylated in a cAMP-dependent manner (Maximov2006Synaptotagmin12). This phosphorylation is crucial for its role in up-regulating spontaneous neurotransmitter release (Maximov2006Synaptotagmin12). SYT12 does not undergo glycosylation and lacks phospholipid binding in a Ca2+-dependent manner, distinguishing it from synaptotagmin-1 (Maximov2006Synaptotagmin12).

The quaternary structure of SYT12 involves forming a complex with synaptotagmin-1, which prevents synaptotagmin-1 from interacting with SNARE complexes, thereby modulating spontaneous neurotransmitter release (Maximov2006Synaptotagmin12). The evolutionary conservation of the phosphorylation site at serine 97 across vertebrate species suggests its functional importance (Maximov2006Synaptotagmin12).

## Function
Synaptotagmin-12 (SYT12) is a synaptic vesicle protein involved in modulating neurotransmitter release in neurons. Unlike other synaptotagmins, SYT12 does not bind calcium, indicating its role in neurotransmitter release is calcium-independent. Instead, SYT12 is phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) at serine-97, which is crucial for its function in synaptic plasticity and spontaneous neurotransmitter release (Maximov2006Synaptotagmin12; KaeserWoo2013Synaptotagmin12).

SYT12 is expressed in the brain and adrenal medulla, with a delayed developmental onset compared to synaptotagmin-1. It forms a complex with synaptotagmin-1, potentially influencing spontaneous neurotransmitter release by interacting with SNARE complexes, although it can also act independently of synaptotagmin-1 (Maximov2006Synaptotagmin12). Overexpression of SYT12 increases spontaneous neurotransmitter release, suggesting its role in synaptic maturation and connectivity changes (Maximov2006Synaptotagmin12).

In the hippocampus, SYT12 is essential for cAMP-dependent presynaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) at mossy-fiber synapses. The phosphorylation of SYT12 on serine-97 is critical for this process, highlighting its role in learning and memory (KaeserWoo2013Synaptotagmin12).

## Clinical Significance
SYT12 (synaptotagmin 12) has been identified as a potential prognostic biomarker for papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). High levels of SYT12 expression are associated with worse outcomes in PTC, particularly in cases with BRAF-positive tumors. This association suggests that SYT12 may contribute to the aggressiveness of the cancer and its resistance to radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy (Jonklaas2017Novel). The study by Jonklaas et al. found that SYT12 has significant predictive ability for initial metastases and longitudinal outcomes in PTC, with a sensitivity of 72% and specificity of 54% for initial metastasis, and a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 47% for longitudinal status (Jonklaas2017Novel). The expression of SYT12 was significantly higher in PTC tissues compared to normal thyroid tissues, with a median fold change of eightfold, indicating its potential role in distinguishing between aggressive and indolent tumors (Jonklaas2017Novel).

In schizophrenia, alterations in synaptic function have been linked to the downregulation of synaptic vesicle-associated proteins, including SYT12. This downregulation may contribute to synaptic pathology in schizophrenia, affecting synaptic stability and axon guidance (Schmitt2012Structural).

## Interactions
Synaptotagmin 12 (SYT12) is known to participate in specific protein interactions that influence synaptic function. SYT12 forms a calcium-independent complex with synaptotagmin-1, a key player in synaptic vesicle exocytosis. This interaction is significant because it prevents synaptotagmin-1 from binding to SNARE complexes, which are essential for neurotransmitter release. This suggests that SYT12 may modulate spontaneous neurotransmitter release by disinhibiting synaptotagmin-1 from SNARE complexes, thereby enhancing spontaneous exocytosis (Maximov2006Synaptotagmin12).

Despite its interaction with synaptotagmin-1, SYT12 does not bind directly to SNARE proteins, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation experiments. This indicates that SYT12's role in neurotransmitter release is distinct from other synaptotagmins that typically interact with SNARE proteins (Maximov2006Synaptotagmin12). The phosphorylation of SYT12 at serine 97 is crucial for its function, particularly in the context of cAMP-dependent synaptic plasticity, highlighting the importance of post-translational modifications in its interactions and regulatory roles (Maximov2006Synaptotagmin12; KaeserWoo2013Synaptotagmin12).
