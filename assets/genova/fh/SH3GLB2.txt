# SH3GLB2

## Overview
The SH3GLB2 gene encodes the protein SH3 domain containing GRB2 like, endophilin B2, which is a member of the endophilin protein family. This protein is characterized by the presence of an N-terminal BAR (Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs) domain and a C-terminal SH3 (Src-homology 3) domain, categorizing it as a BAR domain protein. Endophilin B2 plays a crucial role in cellular processes such as mitochondrial apoptosis, autophagosome formation, and the endocytic degradation of growth factor receptors. It is involved in membrane dynamics, including membrane curvature generation and protein-protein interactions, which are essential for its function in cellular homeostasis and mechanotransduction (Fino2017SH3GLB2endophilin; Takahashi2009Bif1Endophilin). The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to various diseases, including cancer and viral infections, highlighting its clinical significance (Fino2017SH3GLB2endophilin; Huang2021Targeted).

## Structure
Endophilin B2, encoded by the SH3GLB2 gene, is a member of the endophilin protein family, which is characterized by the presence of an N-terminal BAR (Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs) domain and a C-terminal SH3 (Src-homology 3) domain. The BAR domain is crucial for dimerization, allowing the protein to form both homo- and heterodimers, which is a key aspect of its quaternary structure (Ren2006The). This domain is involved in membrane curvature generation and is essential for binding to lipid bilayers (Takahashi2009Bif1Endophilin). The SH3 domain facilitates protein-protein interactions, although specific binding partners for endophilin B2 are not detailed in the available context (Ren2006The).

The N-BAR domain of endophilin B2 includes an N-terminal amphipathic helix, which is important for membrane binding and curvature induction (Takahashi2009Bif1Endophilin). The protein does not localize to the nucleus but is found in cytoplasmic structures (Ren2006The). There is no specific information provided on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms for endophilin B2 in the context (Ren2006The).

## Function
Endophilin B2, encoded by the SH3GLB2 gene, is a protein involved in several critical cellular processes. It is a member of the endophilin family, characterized by the presence of an N-BAR domain, which is essential for protein-protein dimerization, membrane binding, and sensing and forming membrane curvature (Fino2017SH3GLB2endophilin). Endophilin B2 can dimerize with its paralog endophilin B1, playing a significant role in mitochondrial apoptosis, autophagosome formation, and the endocytic degradation of growth factor receptors. The B1/B2 heterodimer is crucial for the degradation of the inner mitochondrial membrane and mitophagy, processes necessary for the autophagy-dependent clearance of damaged mitochondria (Fino2017SH3GLB2endophilin).

Endophilin B2 also interacts with plectin 1 to modulate nuclear cytoskeletal positioning and mechanotransduction, indicating its involvement in maintaining cellular structure and function (Fino2017SH3GLB2endophilin). In the context of viral infections, such as influenza A virus (IAV), endophilin B2 acts as a host factor that promotes viral pathogenicity by facilitating intracellular trafficking and processing of viral components (Fino2017SH3GLB2endophilin). These functions highlight the protein's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its impact on organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SH3GLB2 gene, also known as endophilin B2, have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer. In breast cancer, SH3GLB2 mutations, such as the p.V223M variant, are associated with high-risk patients and poor survival outcomes. These mutations lead to the upregulation of genes like FBXO5, CENPF, and SERPINB3, which are linked to aggressive cancer phenotypes and poor prognosis (Huang2021Targeted). 

In cervical cancer, SH3GLB2 is located in a chromosomal region that frequently shows amplification, suggesting its potential role in tumorigenesis. This amplification correlates with increased expression levels in certain cervical cancer cell lines, indicating that SH3GLB2 may contribute to cancer progression (Kloth2007Combined).

SH3GLB2 also plays a role in lung homeostasis and recovery from severe influenza A virus infection. Studies in mice have shown that the absence of endophilin B2 leads to improved recovery and survival rates following infection, suggesting that SH3GLB2 may influence the severity of respiratory diseases (Fino2017SH3GLB2endophilin). These findings highlight the gene's involvement in both cancer and infectious disease contexts.

## Interactions
SH3GLB2, also known as endophilin B2, is implicated in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins. It is a BAR domain protein that plays a role in cell motility by linking morphological changes to the mechanical properties of the plasma membrane. During the differentiation of HL-60 cells, SH3GLB2 shows upregulated RNA expression, particularly around the third day when the cells become migratory. This suggests that SH3GLB2 may be involved in controlling processes related to cell surface and migration (sitarska2022deciphering).

Although specific protein interactions involving SH3GLB2 are not detailed in the provided context, it is identified as a candidate with differential expression patterns during cell differentiation, indicating its potential involvement in multiprotein complexes or interactions that influence cell migration (sitarska2022deciphering). The context does not provide direct evidence of SH3GLB2 interacting with other proteins or nucleic acids in the studies mentioned, but its role in cell motility and membrane dynamics suggests it may participate in interactions with other proteins involved in these processes. Further research is needed to elucidate the specific interaction partners and mechanisms of SH3GLB2 in cellular contexts.
