# SENP3

## Overview
SENP3, or SUMO specific peptidase 3, is a gene that encodes a protease involved in the post-translational modification process known as deSUMOylation. The protein product of SENP3, SUMO specific peptidase 3, is categorized as a SUMO-specific protease. It primarily targets SUMO2 and SUMO3 modifications, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes, including ribosome biogenesis, transcriptional regulation, and DNA repair (Claessens2024SUMO; Nayak2014SUMOspecific). SENP3 is predominantly localized in the nucleolus but also has functions in the nucleoplasm and mitochondria, where it influences transcriptional processes and mitochondrial dynamics, respectively (Claessens2024SUMO; Nayak2014SUMOspecific). The activity and stability of SENP3 are modulated by environmental factors such as redox stress and nutrient deprivation, underscoring its role in cellular homeostasis and stress responses (Nayak2014SUMOspecific).

## Function
SENP3 (SUMO specific peptidase 3) is a protease that plays a significant role in the deSUMOylation of proteins, primarily targeting SUMO2 and SUMO3 modifications. It is predominantly localized in the nucleolus, where it is involved in ribosome biogenesis by acting on proteins associated with the maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit (Claessens2024SUMO; Nayak2014SUMOspecific). SENP3 also has a nucleoplasmic subfraction that influences transcriptional processes by demodifying transcriptional co-regulators and components of chromatin-modifying complexes, thereby affecting the expression of developmental regulators (Nayak2014SUMOspecific).

In addition to its nuclear functions, SENP3 is involved in maintaining genome integrity and cellular metabolism. It participates in the deSUMOylation of MRE11, which is crucial for DNA repair processes, and is also active in the mitochondria during mitophagy, where it deSUMOylates Fis1, a protein involved in mitochondrial fission (Claessens2024SUMO). SENP3's activity is regulated by environmental stimuli, with its abundance and subcellular distribution being influenced by redox stress and nutrient deprivation (Nayak2014SUMOspecific). These functions highlight SENP3's critical role in cellular homeostasis and stress responses.

## Clinical Significance
SENP3 (SUMO specific peptidase 3) plays a significant role in various diseases due to its involvement in the deSUMOylation process, which affects protein stability and function. In head and neck cancer (HNC), SENP3 enhances the phosphorylation of STAT3, a process linked to smoking and reactive oxygen species, contributing to cancer progression (Zhou2016SUMOylation). In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), increased SENP3 expression is associated with carcinogenesis and differentiation under oxidative stress (Long2020The).

In breast cancer, SENP3 loss in macrophages leads to increased M2 polarization, promoting tumor progression and malignancy (Xiao2021SENP3). In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), reduced SENP3 expression correlates with increased metastasis, while its overexpression inhibits invasion by deSUMOylating DKC1, affecting its stability and interaction with snoRNPs (Wu2023SUMO).

SENP3 is also implicated in neurological diseases, where it regulates cognitive function and mitochondrial fission, affecting conditions like postoperative cognitive dysfunction and ischemia (Long2020The). In subarachnoid hemorrhage and spinal cord injury, SENP3 expression is linked to neuronal apoptosis, suggesting a role in neuronal damage (Long2020The). These findings highlight SENP3 as a potential therapeutic target in various pathologies.

## Interactions
SENP3, a SUMO-specific protease, engages in various protein interactions that regulate its stability and function. It interacts with nucleophosmin (NPM1), which facilitates its accumulation in cells and is involved in its degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, a process triggered by the tumor suppressor protein p19 Arf (Long2020The). SENP3 also interacts with the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and the co-chaperone/ubiquitin ligase CHIP. Under oxidative stress, SENP3's cysteine residues undergo oxidative modification, recruiting Hsp90, which protects SENP3 from CHIP-mediated ubiquitination and degradation (Yan2010Redox).

SENP3 is involved in the desumoylation of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), influencing mitochondrial dynamics and promoting cytochrome c release, a critical step in apoptosis (Guo2013SENP3mediated). The Brucella effectors NyxA and NyxB target SENP3, modulating the subcellular localization of nucleolar proteins. These effectors bind to the N-terminal region of SENP3, affecting its interaction with nucleolar components (Louche2023Brucella). These interactions highlight SENP3's role in cellular stress responses and its involvement in various cellular processes through its dynamic protein interactions.
