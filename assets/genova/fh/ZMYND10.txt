# ZMYND10

## Overview
ZMYND10 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger MYND-type containing 10 protein, which plays a crucial role in the assembly and function of axonemal dynein arms, essential components of motile cilia and flagella in human cells. The protein is characterized by a MYND-type zinc finger domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions necessary for its function as a co-chaperone in the cytoplasm. ZMYND10 is involved in a chaperone relay system that includes interactions with proteins such as FKBP8 and HSP90, ensuring the proper folding, stabilization, and pre-assembly of dynein motor complexes. This function is vital for processes like mucociliary clearance in the respiratory tract and sperm motility. Mutations in the ZMYND10 gene are associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetic disorder that affects ciliary motility, leading to respiratory issues, infertility, and laterality defects (Mali2018ZMYND10; Moore2013Mutations).

## Structure
The ZMYND10 protein is characterized by the presence of a MYND-type zinc finger domain at its C-terminal region, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions (Kobayashi2017Loss; Moore2013Mutations). This domain is conserved across various species, including vertebrates and Drosophila, indicating its evolutionary importance (Kobayashi2017Loss). The protein also contains four conserved classical LxxLL protein-binding motifs, which are involved in interactions with nuclear receptors and transcriptional coactivators (Moore2013Mutations). These motifs are highly conserved across vertebrates and are associated with transcriptional coactivators, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation (Moore2013Mutations).

ZMYND10 is known to interact with several proteins involved in the cytoplasmic pre-assembly of dynein arms, such as LRRC6, DYX1C1, and C21ORF59, highlighting its role in stabilizing intermediate chain proteins during dynein arm assembly (Cho2018ZMYND10). The protein's interactions with molecular chaperones like HSC70 suggest its involvement in the folding and assembly of dynein arms (Cho2018ZMYND10). While specific details on post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms are not provided, the protein's structure and interactions underscore its critical role in ciliary function.

## Function
The ZMYND10 gene encodes a protein that is crucial for the assembly and function of axonemal dynein arms, which are essential components of motile cilia and flagella in human cells. In healthy cells, ZMYND10 operates as part of a chaperone relay system that includes interactions with co-chaperones such as FKBP8 and HSP90. This system facilitates the proper folding, stabilization, and pre-assembly of dynein motor complexes in the cytoplasm before they are transported to the cilia (Mali2018ZMYND10). ZMYND10's role is vital for the motility of cilia, which is necessary for processes like mucociliary clearance in the respiratory tract and sperm motility (Mali2018ZMYND10).

The protein is active in the cytoplasm, where it ensures the stability and maturation of dynein heavy chains, preventing their degradation and ensuring their correct assembly into functional dynein arms (Mali2018ZMYND10). ZMYND10 interacts with several other proteins involved in ciliary function, such as LRRC6, and stabilizes intermediate chain proteins during the pre-assembly of dynein arms (Cho2018ZMYND10). This function is critical for maintaining the structural integrity and motility of cilia, which are essential for respiratory health and fertility (Mali2018ZMYND10; Moore2013Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZMYND10 gene are linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetic disorder characterized by defects in the motility of cilia. This condition leads to respiratory issues, infertility, and laterality defects due to the loss of inner and outer dynein arms essential for ciliary function (Cho2018ZMYND10; Moore2013Mutations). Specific mutations, such as the c.47T>G (p.Val16Gly) missense variant, have been identified as contributing to PCD, with some variants like p.Val16Gly being associated with a milder form of the disease (Moore2013Mutations). 

In Drosophila models, ZMYND10 mutations result in the absence of motile sperm and proprioception deficits, highlighting its role in ciliary and flagellar function (Moore2013Mutations). In humans, the absence of ZMYND10 leads to reduced levels of DNAI1 and DNAI2, crucial for dynein arm assembly, resulting in PCD symptoms (Cho2018ZMYND10). The gene's interaction with proteins like LRRC6 is vital for dynein arm assembly, and its absence can lead to instability and improper assembly of these components (Cho2018ZMYND10; Kurkowiak2016ZMYND10).

## Interactions
ZMYND10 is involved in several critical protein interactions essential for the assembly and function of axonemal dynein arms in cilia. It acts as a co-chaperone within a chaperone complex that includes FKBP8 and HSP90, facilitating the folding and maturation of dynein heavy chains (HCs) in the cytoplasm. This complex is crucial for the pre-assembly of dynein HCs, potentially occurring on the cytosolic face of the endoplasmic reticulum (Mali2018ZMYND10). ZMYND10 also interacts with LRRC6, a protein necessary for dynein arm assembly, through its C-terminal MYND-type zinc finger domain. This interaction is significant for the stabilization of intermediate chain proteins during dynein arm preassembly (Kobayashi2017Loss; Shi2021Primary).

In addition to these interactions, ZMYND10 is part of a chaperone relay system that includes the R2TP complex, which further assists in the assembly of dynein arms by stabilizing and folding dynein heavy chains (Mali2018ZMYND10). The protein also interacts with other cytoplasmic proteins such as DYX1C1, C21ORF59, and DNAI1, which are involved in the pre-assembly of dynein arms, highlighting its role in maintaining the proteostasis network necessary for dynein assembly (Cho2018ZMYND10).
