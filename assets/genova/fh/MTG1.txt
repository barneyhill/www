# MTG1

## Overview
MTG1 is a human gene that encodes the mitochondrial ribosome associated GTPase 1, a crucial protein involved in the assembly of the large subunit of mitochondrial ribosomes. This GTPase plays a significant role in mitochondrial translation and the assembly of respiratory chain complexes, particularly affecting Complexes I and IV. The protein is characterized by its ribosome-dependent GTPase activity, which is essential for its function in mitochondrial translation and energy production. MTG1 is localized to the mitochondrial inner membrane, where it is exposed on the matrix side, indicating its involvement in mitochondrial processes. The protein's evolutionary conservation is underscored by its ability to rescue respiratory deficiencies in yeast mtg1 mutants, highlighting its functional significance across species (Kotani2013Human).

## Structure
MTG1 is a conserved ribosome assembly guanosine triphosphatase involved in the assembly of the mitochondrial ribosome large subunit (mtLSU). The protein contains a GTPase domain, which is crucial for its role in energy transfer and molecular interactions. MTG1 undergoes conformational changes that are limited to its N-terminal helix, which rotates upon the dissociation of state A-specific factors, facilitating interactions with other GTPases such as mt-EngB$GTP through a shared β-sheet formed by the N-terminal helix of MTG1 and the C-terminal extension of mt-EngB$GTP (Jaskolowski2020Structural).

MTG1 directly binds to the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) near the 3' end, particularly in domain VI, which includes helices 95-99. This interaction suggests that MTG1 may protect this region from UV-induced RNA cleavage (Kim2018MTG1). The protein's GTPase activity is stimulated by the mtLSU, and it is suggested to participate in mtLSU assembly, although its precise molecular role remains unknown (Kim2018MTG1).

MTG1 is also involved in the incorporation of late-assembly proteins into the mtLSU by binding to the 16S rRNA, interacting with the mtLSU uL19 protein and mtSSU mS27, which acts as a guanosine triphosphate exchange factor (GEF) (Kim2018MTG1).

## Function
The human gene MTG1 encodes a GTPase that is crucial for the assembly of the large subunit of mitochondrial ribosomes, playing a significant role in mitochondrial translation and the assembly of respiratory chain complexes. MTG1 associates with the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome in a GTP-dependent manner, and its activity is essential for the proper translation of mitochondrial-encoded proteins (Kotani2013Human). The protein exhibits ribosome-dependent GTPase activity, which is vital for its function in mitochondrial translation and the assembly of respiratory complexes, particularly affecting Complexes I and IV (Kotani2013Human).

MTG1 is localized to the mitochondrial inner membrane, where it is exposed on the matrix side, indicating its involvement in mitochondrial processes (Kotani2013Human). Knockdown experiments in human cells have shown that reducing MTG1 levels leads to decreased mitochondrial translation activity and defects in the formation of respiratory complexes, underscoring its importance in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production (Kotani2013Human). The protein's role in ribosome assembly is further supported by its ability to rescue respiratory deficiencies in yeast mtg1 mutants, highlighting its evolutionary conservation and functional significance (Kotani2013Human).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MTG1 gene have been implicated in several pathological conditions. In the context of cardiac health, MTG1 expression is significantly increased in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and in animal models subjected to pressure overload, such as aortic banding in mice. This upregulation is a response to hypertrophic stress, and MTG1 plays a protective role against pathological cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling. MTG1 deficiency exacerbates cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction, while its overexpression has protective effects by preserving mitochondrial function and reducing oxidative stress (Xu2019Novel).

In cancer research, elevated MTG1 expression has been observed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and bladder cancer. In HCC, MTG1 is upregulated during tumor progression, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis and potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target (Faraj2019Elevated; Wu2021Identification). The increased expression of MTG1 in these cancers indicates its involvement in dysregulated signaling pathways that contribute to cancer progression.

Overall, MTG1's role in maintaining mitochondrial function and its altered expression in disease states highlight its clinical significance as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in cardiac and cancer-related pathologies.

## Interactions
MTG1, also known as mitochondrial ribosome associated GTPase 1, is involved in interactions with the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. It associates with the 39S subunit in a GTP-dependent manner, and its binding is detectable only in the presence of GDPNP, a non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue, suggesting that MTG1 dissociates from the 39S subunit after GTP hydrolysis (Kotani2013Human). This interaction is crucial for mitochondrial translation and the assembly of respiratory chain complexes, particularly Complexes I and IV (Kotani2013Human).

MTG1 also interacts with other proteins involved in the maturation of the mitoribosome large subunit (mtLSU). In the absence of GTPBP5, another GTPase, there is an increase in the levels of MTG1, indicating that MTG1 acts earlier in the mtLSU assembly process. The hierarchical order of association suggests that MTG1 associates with the maturing mtLSU particle before GTPBP5 (Maiti2020Human).

In yeast, MTG1 mutations lead to respiratory deficiencies due to defects in mitochondrial translation, and the human MTG1 can rescue this deficiency, highlighting its role in mitochondrial ribosome assembly (Kotani2013Human). These interactions underscore MTG1's essential role in maintaining mitochondrial function and protein synthesis.
