# ZNF493

## Overview
ZNF493 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 493, which is part of the zinc finger protein family known for their role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which facilitate their interaction with DNA, RNA, or other proteins, thereby influencing various cellular processes. Although the specific biological functions of zinc finger protein 493 are not fully elucidated, it is implicated in the modulation of gene expression. Recent studies have highlighted its potential involvement in psychiatric conditions, particularly in the context of lithium treatment response in bipolar disorder patients. The differential expression of ZNF493 in individuals responding to lithium therapy suggests its potential utility as a biomarker for predicting treatment outcomes (Pisanu2018Convergent; Squassina2019Zinc). Further research is warranted to explore the broader implications of ZNF493 in psychiatric and other biological contexts.

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZNF493 has been implicated in the response to lithium treatment in patients with bipolar disorder. Studies have shown that the expression of ZNF493 is significantly altered in individuals who respond to lithium treatment compared to non-responders. Specifically, there is a notable downregulation of ZNF493 expression in lithium responders, suggesting that this gene may play a role in modulating the efficacy of lithium in treating bipolar disorder (Pisanu2018Convergent; Squassina2019Zinc). The exact function of ZNF493 in this context is not fully characterized, but its altered expression in response to lithium treatment highlights its potential as a biomarker for predicting treatment outcomes in bipolar disorder (Pisanu2018Convergent).

While the role of ZNF493 in other diseases or conditions is not detailed in the provided context, its involvement in lithium response suggests that alterations in its expression or function could have broader implications in psychiatric disorders. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to explore the potential clinical applications of ZNF493 in the management of bipolar disorder and possibly other psychiatric conditions (Squassina2019Zinc).
