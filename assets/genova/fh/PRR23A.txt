# PRR23A

## Overview
The PRR23A gene encodes the proline-rich protein 23A, which is part of a family of proteins characterized by a high content of proline residues. These proteins are often involved in various cellular processes, including signaling pathways and structural functions, due to their ability to form flexible and dynamic structures. While the specific role of PRR23A in cellular physiology is not fully elucidated, proteins with proline-rich domains are known to participate in protein-protein interactions, suggesting a potential role in cellular communication and signaling pathways. Further research is needed to clarify the precise biological functions and interactions of the proline-rich protein 23A encoded by the PRR23A gene.
