# BMP15

## Overview
BMP15 (bone morphogenetic protein 15) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily, which plays a pivotal role in ovarian folliculogenesis. The BMP15 protein is a growth factor that is primarily involved in the regulation of granulosa cell function and oocyte maturation within the ovary. It is synthesized as a preproprotein and undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and phosphorylation, which are crucial for its bioactivity (Pulkki2011The). Unlike other TGF-β family members, BMP15 forms non-covalent dimers due to the absence of a fourth conserved cysteine, which is typically involved in covalent dimerization (Liao2003Effect). BMP15 can function as a homodimer or as a heterodimer with growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9), forming a complex known as cumulin, which is essential for enhancing oocyte developmental competence and preventing granulosa cell apoptosis (Sanfins2018GDF9; Rossetti2020Fundamental). Mutations in the BMP15 gene have been linked to primary ovarian insufficiency, highlighting its critical role in female fertility (Rossetti2009BMP15).

## Structure
BMP15 (bone morphogenetic protein 15) is a member of the TGF-β superfamily and is synthesized as a preproprotein, which includes a signal peptide, a prodomain, and a mature domain (Liao2003Effect; AlMusawi2013Species). The primary structure of BMP15 consists of a polypeptide chain with seven conserved cysteines, six of which form intramolecular disulfide bonds, creating a 'cystine knot' structure crucial for its function and stability (Li2009Stable). Unlike other TGF-β family members, BMP15 lacks the fourth conserved cysteine necessary for forming covalently linked intermolecular dimers, resulting in non-covalent dimer formation (Liao2003Effect; Pulkki2011The).

The tertiary structure of BMP15 involves this cystine knot motif, which is typical of TGF-β proteins (Li2009Stable). In terms of quaternary structure, BMP15 can form homodimers or heterodimers with GDF9, another member of the TGF-β superfamily (Heath2017Molecular). Post-translational modifications of BMP15 include glycosylation and phosphorylation, which are essential for its bioactivity (Pulkki2011The). These modifications can affect the protein's function, as seen with the C-terminal modifications that impact BMP15's bioactivity (Pulkki2011The).

## Function
BMP15, a member of the TGF-β superfamily, plays a critical role in ovarian folliculogenesis by regulating granulosa cell function and oocyte maturation. In healthy human cells, BMP15 is secreted by oocytes and acts primarily on granulosa cells, promoting their proliferation and modulating their sensitivity to follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) (Moore2005Molecular; Rossetti2020Fundamental). It stimulates granulosa cell mitosis and the expression of the kit ligand, which is essential for early follicle growth (Moore2005Molecular). BMP15 also inhibits FSH-induced progesterone synthesis, preventing premature luteinization of the follicle (Sanfins2018GDF9).

BMP15 functions as a homodimer or as a heterodimer with GDF9, forming cumulin, which has significant bioactivity on granulosa cells (Rossetti2020Fundamental). This interaction is crucial for enhancing oocyte developmental competence and preventing granulosa cell apoptosis (Sanfins2018GDF9). BMP15 activates the Smad1/5/8 signaling pathway by binding to specific receptors, ALK-6 and BMPRII, influencing granulosa cell proliferation and differentiation (Sanfins2018GDF9). These molecular processes are vital for normal ovarian function and fertility, as mutations in BMP15 can lead to conditions such as primary ovarian insufficiency (Rossetti2020Fundamental).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the BMP15 gene are associated with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), a condition characterized by impaired ovarian function leading to infertility in women under 40. These mutations can result in defective production of the BMP15 protein, which is crucial for follicular development and female fertility (Rossetti2009BMP15). Specific mutations, such as c.986G.A (R329H) and c.581T.C (F194S), have been identified in patients with POI, leading to reduced protein activity and impaired interaction with growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9), which is essential for granulosa cell growth and differentiation (Unknownauthors2017BMP15MutationsAssociatedWithPrimaryOvarianInsufficiencyReduceExpression).

The BMP15 gene is located on the X chromosome, and its mutations can lead to diminished ovarian follicle viability and increased follicular atresia (Rossetti2009BMP15). Variants such as L148P, F194S, and Y235C are particularly disruptive to BMP15 secretion, affecting ovarian function and potentially leading to POI (Unknownauthors2017BMP15MutationsAssociatedWithPrimaryOvarianInsufficiencyReduceExpression). These mutations may also contribute to premature ovarian failure (POF), characterized by amenorrhea and elevated follicle-stimulating hormone levels, indicating impaired ovarian function (Tiotiu2010Variants).

## Interactions
BMP15 interacts with several proteins, primarily forming complexes with growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9). These interactions are crucial for its role in ovarian folliculogenesis. BMP15 and GDF9 can form heteromeric complexes through noncovalent interactions, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments. The mature regions of BMP15 and GDF9 interact with their respective proregions, and GDF9 mature protein can coimmunoprecipitate with the BMP15 proregion, suggesting the existence of BMP15/GDF9 heteromers (McIntosh2008The).

BMP15 can also form homodimers through hydrophobic interactions, although it lacks the conserved cysteine involved in peptide dimerization found in most TGF-β family members. A variant of BMP15, hBMP15S356C, which includes a cysteine residue, forms a covalent homodimer, highlighting the significance of dimerization for its signaling function (Pulkki2012A).

BMP15 interacts with specific receptors on granulosa cells, including BMPR1B and BMPR2. These interactions are essential for its biological activity, influencing processes such as FSH-induced progesterone production and thymidine incorporation (Moore2003Molecular; Pulkki2012A). The binding of BMP15 to these receptors is crucial for its role in fertility regulation (Pulkki2012A).
