# CAND2

## Overview
CAND2 is a gene that encodes the protein cullin-associated and neddylation-dissociated 2 (putative), which is involved in the regulation of protein degradation pathways. The protein is primarily expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscles, where it plays a crucial role in muscle differentiation and maintenance by interacting with the SCF (Skp, Cullin, F-box containing complex) ubiquitin ligase complex. CAND2 functions by inhibiting the SCF-dependent ubiquitination of myogenin, a muscle-specific transcription factor, thereby stabilizing myogenin and promoting myogenic differentiation (Shiraishi2007TBPinteracting). This regulatory mechanism is essential for the differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes. Additionally, CAND2 has been implicated in cardiac conditions, such as pathological cardiac remodeling and atrial fibrillation, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Wei2016NEURL; Gorska2020Muscle).

## Function
CAND2, also known as cullin-associated and neddylation-dissociated 2, plays a significant role in the regulation of protein degradation pathways, particularly through its interaction with the SCF (Skp, Cullin, F-box containing complex) ubiquitin ligase complex. In healthy human cells, CAND2 inhibits SCF-dependent ubiquitination of myogenin, a muscle-specific transcription factor, thereby stabilizing myogenin and promoting myogenic differentiation. This process is crucial for the differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes, as seen in studies using C2C12 cells, a mouse myoblast cell line (Shiraishi2007TBPinteracting).

CAND2 is expressed specifically in skeletal and cardiac muscles and is involved in the differentiation and maintenance of muscle cells. It achieves this by binding to Cullin 1 (CUL1), a component of the SCF complex, and disrupting the SCF-myogenin complex, which reduces ubiquitination and degradation of myogenin (Shiraishi2007TBPinteracting). This stabilization of myogenin by CAND2 is proposed as a novel regulatory mechanism for myogenesis, highlighting its critical role in muscle tissue differentiation and maintenance (Shiraishi2007TBPinteracting).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CAND2 gene have been linked to several cardiac conditions, particularly in the context of pathological cardiac remodeling and atrial fibrillation (AF). CAND2 is upregulated in cardiac muscle during pathological stress, contributing to adverse cardiac remodeling through the mTORC1 signaling pathway. This upregulation is associated with pathological hypertrophy in cardiomyocytes, mediated by increased Grk5 protein levels, which are linked to pathological gene expression profiles (Gorska2020Muscle). Knock-out studies in mice have shown that the absence of CAND2 provides protection against pathological cardiac remodeling and dysfunction, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Gorska2020Muscle).

CAND2 has also been associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation. Genetic studies have identified the SNP rs4642101 at the CAND2 locus as significantly associated with AF, with the risk allele correlating with increased CAND2 expression (Sinner2014Integrating; Wei2016NEURL). This increased expression is thought to influence the electrical activity of the heart, potentially contributing to AF susceptibility (Sinner2014Integrating). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CAND2 in cardiac diseases and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.
