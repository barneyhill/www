# CATIP

## Overview
The CATIP gene, also known as C2orf62, encodes the ciliogenesis associated TTC17 interacting protein, which is integral to the process of primary ciliogenesis. This protein is involved in the regulation of actin polymerization, a critical component of the cytoskeleton that influences the structure and function of cilia. The protein is particularly significant in ciliated cells and sperm cells, where it contributes to the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and the arrangement of microtubules in the axoneme, essential for sperm motility. Mutations in the CATIP gene have been linked to oligoteratoasthenozoospermia (OTA), a condition that affects male fertility by impairing sperm count, morphology, and motility. The protein's role in actin filament dynamics underscores its importance in cellular communication and tissue development, particularly in the context of reproductive health (Arafat2020Mutation).

## Function
The CATIP gene, also known as C2orf62, encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in primary ciliogenesis by modulating actin polymerization. In healthy human cells, CATIP is essential for the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, which is vital for the proper structure and function of cilia. This protein is highly expressed in various ciliated cells and is involved in maintaining the actin cytoskeleton, particularly in sperm cells, where it affects the microtubule arrangement in the axoneme, a structure critical for sperm motility (Arafat2020Mutation).

CATIP influences the kinetics of actin repolymerization, interfering with actin polymerization, which is crucial for cellular processes such as ciliogenesis and sperm motility. The normal CATIP protein is stable over time, whereas a mutant version shows reduced stability, indicating its role in maintaining protein stability (Arafat2020Mutation). In sperm cells, CATIP facilitates the presence of fibrillar (F)-actin in the sperm tail, which is vital for the development of sperm motility (Arafat2020Mutation). The protein's activity is crucial for actin filament dynamics, impacting cellular communication and tissue development through its role in cilia assembly and maintenance (Arafat2020Mutation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CATIP gene (ciliogenesis associated TTC17 interacting protein) are clinically significant as they are linked to oligoteratoasthenozoospermia (OTA), a condition characterized by low sperm count, poor sperm morphology, and reduced sperm motility, leading to male infertility. A specific homozygous missense mutation, c.T103A, p.Phe35Ile, was identified in a consanguineous Bedouin family, which affects actin dynamics and ciliogenesis. This mutation results in reduced protein stability and disrupts actin polymerization, crucial for sperm motility and structure (Arafat2020Mutation).

The mutation leads to defects in the microtubule arrangement within the sperm tail axoneme, causing abnormal sperm structure. It also alters the distribution of actin filaments in sperm cells, with a significant reduction in the normal distribution pattern in affected individuals compared to healthy ones. The mutation affects the kinetics of actin repolymerization, allowing faster reformation of actin filaments, suggesting a loss of function in actin polymerization (Arafat2020Mutation).

The CATIP gene is highly conserved and expressed in ciliated cells and the testis. Its depletion affects actin polymerization and cilia formation, as demonstrated in a mouse model with a CATIP knockout, which showed male infertility, underscoring the gene's role in reproductive health (Arafat2020Mutation).
