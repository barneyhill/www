# DDX51

## Overview
DDX51, or DEAD-box helicase 51, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the DEAD-box family of RNA helicases, which are characterized by the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD). The protein encoded by DDX51 is primarily involved in ribosome biogenesis, playing a critical role in the processing and maturation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) within the nucleolus of human cells. It facilitates the release of small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) U8 from pre-rRNA complexes, a necessary step for the proper folding and processing of pre-rRNA into mature rRNA components. Beyond its fundamental role in ribosome assembly, DEAD-box helicase 51 is implicated in various cellular processes, including RNA splicing and the regulation of apoptotic pathways. It also influences cell proliferation by modulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, thereby affecting cell cycle progression and potentially contributing to oncogenic processes (Zhang2021DEAD-Box; Sergeeva2021RNA; 1).

## Function
DDX51 (DEAD-box helicase 51) is a crucial component in ribosome biogenesis, primarily active in the nucleolus of human cells. It is involved in the processing and maturation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), particularly in the release of the box C/D small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) U8 from pre-rRNA complexes. This release is essential for the proper folding and processing of the 47S pre-rRNA into mature rRNA components, including the 28S rRNA, which is a critical part of the ribosomal subunit (1 page 9 of 30; 1 page 11 of 30).

DDX51 facilitates the displacement of U8 snoRNA from pre-rRNA, which is necessary for the removal of the 3' external transcribed spacer from 28S rRNA, enabling productive downstream processing. This activity underscores its role in the structural rearrangements required for ribosome maturation (Sergeeva2021RNA; 1).

In addition to its role in rRNA processing, DDX51 acts as a negative regulator of the apoptotic effector p53, promoting cell proliferation. It is also involved in the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, influencing the expression of cyclin D1 and affecting cell cycle progression (Sergeeva2021RNA).

## Clinical Significance
DDX51 is implicated in cancer, particularly breast cancer, through its role in cell proliferation and the cell cycle. It promotes breast cancer cell proliferation by activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and affects the expression of cyclin D1. A decrease in DDX51 expression results in cell cycle arrest in the S phase, suggesting its critical role in cell cycle progression and its potential involvement in cancer (Zhang2021DEAD-Box; Sergeeva2021RNA).

In familial non-medullary thyroid carcinoma (FNMTC), DDX51 has been identified as one of the genes with variants segregating with the disease. Although the pathogenicity of these variants is not conclusively determined, the gene's association with tumor development through the Wnt signaling pathway suggests a potential role in cancer (Tous2023Identification).

DDX51 is also a negative regulator of the apoptotic effector p53, promoting cell proliferation. This regulation may contribute to its role in cancer by facilitating unchecked cell growth (Zhang2021DEAD-Box; Sergeeva2021RNA). Further studies are needed to explore the full extent of DDX51's involvement in cancer-related processes.

## Interactions
DDX51, a member of the DEAD-box helicase family, is known for its involvement in various RNA metabolism processes, including ribosome biogenesis and RNA splicing. It participates in numerous interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, often as part of larger ribonucleoprotein complexes. These interactions can be either transient or stable, significantly impacting cellular processes such as gene expression regulation.

DDX51 interacts with a variety of proteins, forming complexes that are crucial for its function in RNA processing. These interactions are essential for the assembly and maturation of ribosomal subunits, a critical step in protein synthesis. The helicase activity of DDX51 is believed to facilitate the remodeling of RNA-protein complexes, allowing for the proper assembly and function of these structures.

In addition to its role in ribosome biogenesis, DDX51 is involved in RNA splicing, where it interacts with spliceosomal components to influence the splicing of pre-mRNA. This interaction is vital for the accurate removal of introns and the joining of exons, ensuring the production of mature mRNA molecules ready for translation.

The ability of DDX51 to interact with both proteins and nucleic acids highlights its versatile role in cellular RNA metabolism, underscoring its importance in maintaining proper cellular function.
