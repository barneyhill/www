# RIMOC1

## Overview
RIMOC1 is a gene that encodes the protein known as RAB7A interacting MON1-CCZ1 complex subunit 1. This protein is a component of the MON1-CCZ1 complex, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of endosomal trafficking. The MON1-CCZ1 complex is involved in the conversion of early endosomes to late endosomes, a process essential for proper cellular function and intracellular transport. The protein encoded by RIMOC1 is categorized as a subunit within this complex, contributing to its function in endosomal maturation and membrane trafficking. Understanding the role of RIMOC1 and its encoded protein is significant for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying various cellular processes and their implications in human health and disease.
