# QPCTL

## Overview
QPCTL, or glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase like, is a gene that encodes an enzyme involved in the post-translational modification of proteins. This enzyme is categorized as a cyclotransferase and is responsible for catalyzing the formation of pyroglutamate from glutaminyl residues at the N-terminus of peptides. This modification is crucial for the stability and function of various proteins, including chemokines, by protecting them from degradation. The QPCTL enzyme is active in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, where it plays a significant role in protein maturation and function, particularly in modulating immune responses. It is involved in the N-terminal cyclization of chemokines, which is essential for monocyte migration and immune cell infiltration. Additionally, QPCTL is implicated in the immune checkpoint pathway, influencing cancer cell evasion of immune surveillance, making it a potential target for cancer immunotherapy (Yu2023Development; Barreira2022Loss; Cynis2011The).

## Function
The QPCTL gene encodes an enzyme involved in the post-translational modification of proteins, specifically catalyzing the formation of pyroglutamate from glutaminyl residues at the N-terminus of peptides. This modification is crucial for the stability and function of certain proteins, such as chemokines, by protecting them from degradation by extracellular peptidases (Cynis2011The). QPCTL is active in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, where it influences protein maturation and function in various cellular processes (Cynis2011The).

In healthy human cells, QPCTL plays a significant role in modulating immune responses. It is involved in the N-terminal cyclization of chemokines like CCL2 and CCL7, which are essential for monocyte migration and function. This process ensures the chemokines' activity by preventing their inactivation, thereby maintaining monocyte homeostasis and influencing immune cell infiltration (Barreira2022Loss; Cynis2011The). The enzyme's activity is crucial for effective monocyte recruitment and signaling, impacting processes such as inflammation and immune surveillance (Barreira2022Loss). By modulating chemokine function, QPCTL contributes to the regulation of immune cell dynamics and tissue homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the QPCTL gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. In gliomas, QPCTL expression is notably higher in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, correlating with advanced tumor stages and grades. This elevated expression is associated with shorter overall survival and disease-free survival in glioma patients, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Liu2023Deciphering). The DNA methylation status of QPCTL is lower in glioma patients, which correlates with higher gene expression and is indicative of glioma progression from grade II to grade IV. Higher DNA methylation levels are linked to longer survival in glioblastoma multiforme patients, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for glioma prognosis (Liu2023Deciphering).

In the context of tumor immunity, QPCTL plays a crucial role in modifying chemokines, such as CCL2 and CCL7, which are essential for monocyte migration and myeloid cell infiltration in tumors. Loss of QPCTL expression disrupts monocyte homeostasis, attenuates tumor growth, and alters myeloid cell infiltration, reducing populations with immunosuppressive profiles (Barreira2022Loss). Targeting QPCTL can enhance the efficacy of checkpoint blockade therapies, such as anti-PD-L1 treatment, by engaging multiple myeloid anti-tumor mechanisms (Barreira2022Loss).

## Interactions
QPCTL (glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase like) is involved in the post-translational modification of proteins, specifically catalyzing the formation of pyroglutamate at the N-terminus. This modification is crucial for the interaction between CD47 and signal-regulatory protein α (SIRPα), a key component of the immune checkpoint pathway. The interaction between CD47 and SIRPα serves as a 'don't eat me' signal, allowing cancer cells to evade macrophage-mediated phagocytosis (Wu2019Identification; Yu2023Development). 

QPCTL's enzymatic activity is necessary for the N-terminal pyroglutamate formation on CD47, which is essential for the binding of SIRPα. This interaction is significant in cancer immune evasion and is a target for cancer immunotherapy (Wu2019Identification). Inhibition of QPCTL can disrupt this interaction, enhancing macrophage-mediated phagocytosis of cancer cells and improving the efficacy of PD-1 blockade therapies (Yu2023Development).

QPCTL also interacts with chemokines such as CCL2 and CCL7, modifying them to protect against proteolytic inactivation. This modification is important for monocyte migration and affects the tumor microenvironment by regulating myeloid cell infiltration (Barreira2022Loss). These interactions highlight QPCTL's role in modulating immune responses and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
