# ZNF286A

## Overview
ZNF286A is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 286A, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family known for their role as transcription factors. These proteins are characterized by their zinc finger motifs, which enable them to bind DNA and regulate gene expression. Zinc finger protein 286A is involved in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis, by modulating the transcriptional activity of target genes. Unlike many other zinc finger proteins, ZNF286A does not exhibit typical transcriptional repression activity through the KRAB domain, as it does not significantly interact with the co-repressor KAP1 (Itokawa2009KAP1independent). This unique characteristic suggests that ZNF286A may have distinct regulatory roles in cellular homeostasis and development.

## Structure


## Function
ZNF286A encodes a zinc finger protein that functions primarily as a transcription factor, playing a significant role in the regulation of gene expression. These proteins are characterized by their ability to bind to DNA, influencing the transcriptional activity of target genes. Zinc finger proteins, including ZNF286A, are crucial in various cellular processes such as cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. They are typically active in the nucleus, where they exert their effects on gene expression by interacting with specific DNA sequences. This interaction can lead to the activation or repression of genes, thereby modulating cellular functions and contributing to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. The precise regulation of these processes is essential for normal cellular function and organismal development, highlighting the importance of ZNF286A in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
ZNF286A, a member of the zinc finger protein family, has been studied for its role in transcriptional regulation. However, specific interactions of ZNF286A with other proteins or nucleic acids have not been detailed extensively in the available literature. In a study investigating the transcriptional activities of various KRAB-ZNF proteins, ZNF286A did not exhibit transcriptional repression activity under the tested conditions, unlike most other KRAB-ZNFs (Itokawa2009KAP1independent). This suggests that ZNF286A may not interact with the typical co-repressor KAP1, as its transcriptional repression activity was not significantly affected by the reduction of KAP1 expression (Itokawa2009KAP1independent).

The study also explored the role of the SCAN domain in transcriptional repression, indicating that the SCAN domain is necessary for repression activity. However, specific protein interactions involving ZNF286A were not detailed, and it was noted for having low luciferase activity, indicating a lack of interaction with KAP1 (Itokawa2009KAP1independent). Overall, while ZNF286A is part of the zinc finger protein family, its specific interactions remain largely uncharacterized in the current scientific literature.
