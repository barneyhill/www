# DNASE1L3

## Overview
The DNASE1L3 gene encodes the protein deoxyribonuclease 1 like 3, a member of the deoxyribonuclease family, which plays a pivotal role in the degradation of extracellular DNA. This enzyme is particularly involved in the clearance of DNA from apoptotic bodies and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), thereby maintaining immune tolerance and preventing autoimmune responses. The DNASE1L3 protein is characterized by a unique two-domain structure, including a core domain and an intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain (CTD), which enhances its ability to bind and degrade complexed DNA, such as lipid-complexed or antibody-bound DNA (McCord2022Structurala; McCord2022Structural). The enzyme is primarily secreted by dendritic cells and macrophages and is expressed in the liver and lymphoid organs. Mutations in the DNASE1L3 gene, such as the Arg206Cys substitution, have been linked to autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, highlighting its clinical significance in immune regulation (Zervou2020Association; Coke2021Arg206Cys).

## Structure
The DNASE1L3 protein is characterized by a two-domain structure, consisting of a core domain and an intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain (CTD) (McCord2022Structurala). The core domain exhibits a classic 4-layer α-β sandwich architecture, typical of the exo/endo phosphatase (EEP) family, and shares structural similarities with human DNASE1, with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.8 Å across all C-α atoms (McCord2022Structurala). The CTD, extending from Ser-283 to Ser-305, is positively charged and hypothesized to form a rigid α-helix that enhances the enzyme's ability to degrade complexed DNA (McCord2022Structurala).

The CTD is largely disordered, with a small N-terminal helix followed by disordered regions, contributing to the protein's flexibility and DNA binding capacity (McCord2022Structurala). Structural studies using X-ray crystallography and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy have provided insights into the DNASE1L3 structure, supporting a two-cation catalytic mechanism involving His-155 and His-274 as the catalytic acid and base residues, respectively (McCord2022Structurala).

DNASE1L3 lacks N-linked glycosylation sites found in DNASE1, which may affect its stability and function (McCord2022Structurala). The protein is expressed as an enzymatically inactive fusion protein in E. coli, which is activated through proteolytic cleavage (McCord2022Structurala). The R206C mutation in DNASE1L3 disrupts a critical salt-bridge network, affecting protein folding and stability, and is associated with diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus (McCord2022Structurala).

## Function
The DNASE1L3 gene encodes an enzyme that plays a critical role in the degradation of extracellular DNA, particularly in apoptotic bodies and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). This function is essential for maintaining immune tolerance by preventing the accumulation of self-DNA, which can trigger autoimmune responses (Coke2021Arg206Cys; Mathapathi2022Contribution). DNASE1L3 is active in the extracellular space, where it digests nucleic acids from self-sources such as apoptosis or NETosis, breaking down larger DNA fragments into smaller mononucleosomal fragments (Mathapathi2022Contribution).

The enzyme is primarily secreted by dendritic cells and macrophages and is expressed predominantly in the liver and lymphoid organs such as the spleen (Chan2020Plasma). It is involved in the regulation of plasma DNA size and motif frequency, acting in a cell-extrinsic manner to maintain a typical cell-free DNA profile (Chan2020Plasma). DNASE1L3's unique C-terminal domain enhances its ability to bind and degrade complexed DNA, such as lipid-complexed or antibody-bound DNA, which Dnase1 cannot efficiently process (McCord2022Structural). This activity is crucial for clearing antigenic DNA from the bloodstream, thus preventing inflammatory diseases (McCord2022Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DNASE1L3 gene are associated with several autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and systemic sclerosis (SSc). The rs35677470 missense variant, which results in an Arg206Cys substitution, is a significant risk factor for these conditions. This variant affects the protein's secretion and stability, leading to impaired clearance of extracellular DNA, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of these diseases (Zervou2020Association; Coke2021Arg206Cys).

In SLE, DNASE1L3 deficiency is linked to the accumulation of undigested DNA fragments, triggering the production of anti-DNA autoantibodies. This deficiency can result from null mutations or the presence of neutralizing autoantibodies against DNASE1L3, contributing to disease symptoms such as lupus nephritis and vascular inflammation (Chan2020Plasma; Mathapathi2022Contribution).

The DNASE1L3 gene is also associated with scleroderma, where the rs35677470 variant has been identified as a susceptibility locus. This genetic overlap with SLE suggests shared pathogenic mechanisms involving impaired DNA degradation (Zochling2014An). Understanding these genetic associations may lead to the development of targeted therapies for these autoimmune diseases.

## Interactions
DNASE1L3 is a deoxyribonuclease involved in the degradation of extracellular DNA, particularly DNA complexed with lipids and proteins. It has a unique C-terminal domain (CTD) that enhances its ability to bind and degrade complexed DNA, contributing to its diverse DNA degradation capacity (McCord2022Structural). The CTD is intrinsically disordered and does not bind lipids or microparticles, indicating specificity for DNA interactions (McCord2022Structural). 

DNASE1L3 is resistant to actin inhibition, a limitation for DNASE1, due to structural differences that disrupt potential actin binding sites (McCord2022Structural). The enzyme's activity involves a two-cation catalytic mechanism, with structural studies supporting the presence of two Mg2+ ions in the active site, coordinating with the DNA substrate (McCord2022Structural). 

Mutations in DNASE1L3, such as the R206C SNP, disrupt critical salt-bridge networks, affecting protein stability and function, which can lead to decreased enzyme activity and secretion (Zervou2020Association; McCord2022Structural). These interactions and structural features are crucial for DNASE1L3's role in nucleic acid degradation and its resistance to actin inhibition (McCord2022Structural).
