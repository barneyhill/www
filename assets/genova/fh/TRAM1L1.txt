# TRAM1L1

## Overview
TRAM1L1 is a gene that encodes the translocation associated membrane protein 1 like 1, which is involved in cellular processes related to membrane dynamics. The protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein, playing a crucial role in the translocation of proteins across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. This function is essential for proper protein sorting and cellular homeostasis. The TRAM1L1 gene has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including its association with embryonal carcinoma, a subtype of testicular germ cell tumor, and its downregulation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) models, suggesting its potential as a molecular marker and therapeutic target in these diseases (Henriques2018Sphingolipid; Yao2023Comprehensive). Further research is necessary to elucidate the full spectrum of TRAM1L1's biological roles and its impact on human health.

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TRAM1L1 gene have been specifically associated with embryonal carcinoma, a subtype of testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT). The study by Yao et al. highlights that TRAM1L1 mutations occur exclusively in embryonal carcinoma, suggesting its potential as a molecular marker and therapeutic target for this TGCT subtype (Yao2023Comprehensive). This finding underscores the importance of understanding somatic mutations in cancer progression and treatment strategies.

In the context of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the TRAM1L1 gene, referred to as Tram1l1 in the study, is among the most downregulated genes in the spinal cord of SOD1 G86R mice, an animal model for ALS. This downregulation is part of a broader dysregulation of genes involved in immune system processes and cellular components related to membranes or vesicles, such as extracellular exosomes and lysosomes. These findings suggest that alterations in TRAM1L1 expression may contribute to the metabolic reorientation occurring in ALS, providing insights into the disease's pathology (Henriques2018Sphingolipid).

While these studies highlight the potential clinical significance of TRAM1L1 mutations and expression alterations, further research is needed to fully understand their implications in various diseases.
