# CNIH2

## Overview
CNIH2 is a gene that encodes the cornichon family AMPA receptor auxiliary protein 2, a transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in the modulation of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) in the central nervous system. This protein is integral to the trafficking and surface expression of AMPARs, particularly influencing the GluA subunits by facilitating their export from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface. As an auxiliary subunit, CNIH-2 is involved in the assembly and functional modulation of AMPAR complexes, impacting synaptic strength and plasticity. Its interactions with other proteins, such as transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs), further refine the pharmacological and biophysical properties of AMPARs, which are essential for fast excitatory neurotransmission (Harmel2012AMPA; Herring2013Cornichon; Gill2011Cornichon2).

## Function
CNIH2 encodes a protein that functions as an auxiliary subunit of AMPA receptors (AMPARs), which are essential for fast excitatory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. The CNIH-2 protein is involved in the trafficking and surface expression of AMPARs, particularly the GluA subunits, by acting as an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) cargo exporter. It facilitates the COPII-dependent export of these receptors from the ER to the cell surface, thereby increasing their density and enhancing synaptic signaling (Harmel2012AMPA).

CNIH-2 interacts with GluA subunits early in the secretory pathway, promoting their transport to the cell surface and modifying receptor signaling. This interaction allows CNIH-2 to transition from a cargo exporter to a surface membrane protein, influencing the biophysical properties of AMPARs and potentially affecting synaptic plasticity (Harmel2012AMPA).

In neurons, CNIH-2 is crucial for the proper assembly and function of AMPAR complexes, impacting synaptic strength and plasticity. It modulates the kinetics of AMPAR-mediated synaptic currents and is involved in the maturation and trafficking of these receptors, contributing to their functional properties at synapses (Brockie2013Cornichons; Herring2013Cornichon).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CNIH2 gene have been implicated in various neurological disorders. CNIH2 is an auxiliary subunit that modulates AMPA receptor (AMPAR) properties, which are crucial for synaptic transmission and plasticity. Disruptions in CNIH2 function can lead to significant changes in AMPAR-mediated synaptic currents, potentially impacting cognitive processes and synaptic plasticity (Herring2013Cornichon; Matthews2021Biology).

Although specific diseases directly linked to CNIH2 mutations are not extensively detailed in the provided context, the gene's role in AMPAR trafficking and function suggests that its dysfunction could contribute to intellectual disabilities and other neurodevelopmental disorders. For instance, a deletion in CNIH2 has been associated with mild intellectual disability in a clinical case, indicating its potential involvement in cognitive impairments (Soto2014Glutamate).

The absence of CNIH2 can lead to impaired maturation and retention of AMPARs, resulting in a loss of surface AMPARs, which are essential for synaptic plasticity and long-term potentiation (Herring2013Cornichon). These disruptions in synaptic function may underlie the neurological deficits observed in conditions associated with CNIH2 alterations.

## Interactions
CNIH2, a cornichon family AMPA receptor auxiliary protein, participates in several key interactions with other proteins, particularly influencing AMPA receptor complexes. CNIH2 interacts with transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs) such as γ-7 and γ-8, modulating the stoichiometry and pharmacological properties of AMPA receptors. This interaction affects the gating and pharmacology of these receptors by reducing the number of TARP subunits within the complexes (Gill2011Cornichon2).

In hippocampal neurons, CNIH2's surface expression is dependent on γ-8, and it is involved in the trafficking of AMPA receptors through the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus (Gill2011Cornichon2). CNIH2 also interacts with GluA1 and GluA2 subunits, with a preference for GluA1-containing AMPARs, influencing their trafficking to synapses (Herring2013Cornichon).

The presence of γ-8 prevents CNIH2 from associating with GluA2 subunits, highlighting a specificity in its binding interactions (Herring2013Cornichon). CNIH2's interaction with TARP γ-8 is crucial for its role in modulating AMPA receptor properties, as it can co-occupy GluA1 subunits with γ-8 without displacing each other (Herring2013Cornichon).
