# NEDD9

## Overview
NEDD9, or neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated 9, is a gene that encodes a scaffolding protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, migration, and adhesion. The NEDD9 protein, also known as HEF1 or Cas-L, is a non-enzymatic scaffolding protein that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of mitosis and cell signaling pathways. It is particularly significant in the context of cancer, where its overexpression is associated with tumor progression and metastasis. NEDD9 interacts with several key proteins, such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK), SRC family kinases, and Aurora A kinase, influencing pathways that regulate cell survival, proliferation, and migration. Its expression is observed in various tissues and is notably abundant in tumor cells, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology (Moore2010The; Shagisultanova2015Preclinical; Tikhmyanova2009CAS).

## Structure


## Function
NEDD9, also known as HEF1 or Cas-L, is a scaffolding protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in cell cycle regulation, particularly during mitosis, where it associates with centrosomes and the mitotic apparatus. NEDD9 influences spindle assembly and cytokinesis, with its levels peaking at the G2/M phase and decreasing as the cell progresses through mitosis (Tikhmyanova2009CAS; Singh2007Molecular). It interacts with Aurora A kinase, which is essential for chromosome separation, and regulates RhoA, impacting mitosis through cortical actin contractility (Tikhmyanova2009CAS).

NEDD9 is also significant in cell migration and adhesion, particularly in immune cells. It is involved in integrin-mediated signaling and chemotaxis, forming complexes with proteins like Lck and Fyn, which are crucial for T-cell receptor activation (Tikhmyanova2009CAS). In the context of apoptosis, NEDD9 is cleaved by caspases, leading to focal adhesion disassembly and cell death, although its overexpression can induce apoptosis in some cell lines (Tikhmyanova2009CAS; Singh2007Molecular).

NEDD9 is expressed in various tissues, including the lung, kidney, and fetal brain, and is abundant in tumor cells from epithelial lineages, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Tikhmyanova2009CAS).

## Clinical Significance
The NEDD9 gene is implicated in various cancers, where its overexpression is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. In colorectal cancer, high NEDD9 expression correlates with advanced stages and poor survival, mediated by hypoxia and WNT signaling pathways (Shagisultanova2015Preclinical). In hepatocellular carcinoma, NEDD9 is regulated by FOXC1, promoting metastasis (Shagisultanova2015Preclinical). In pancreatic and ovarian cancers, elevated NEDD9 levels are linked to advanced clinical stages and poor outcomes (Gabbasov2018NEDD9; Shagisultanova2015Preclinical). In prostate cancer, NEDD9 promotes cell invasion and is associated with higher Gleason scores and metastases (Shagisultanova2015Preclinical).

NEDD9 also plays a significant role in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where its overexpression enhances cell motility and invasion, leading to increased metastasis and poor prognosis (Kondo2012Impact; Jin2013NEDD9). In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), NEDD9 overexpression is linked to poor clinical outcomes and may guide treatment decisions (Hua2021NEDD9).

Beyond cancer, NEDD9 is involved in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), where its absence promotes cyst formation in mouse models, linked to its interaction with Aurora-A kinase (Nikonova2014Nedd9). NEDD9 is also upregulated in neurons during stroke recovery, promoting recovery after cerebral ischemia (Shagisultanova2015Preclinical).

## Interactions
NEDD9, also known as HEF1 or Cas-L, is a scaffolding protein that participates in numerous protein interactions, playing a critical role in cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and SRC family kinases, which are essential for integrin signaling and cytoskeletal organization, facilitating cell migration and invasion (Pugacheva2006HEF1Aurora; Shagisultanova2015Preclinical). NEDD9 also forms complexes with CRKL, BCR-ABL, and other proteins, linking it to pathways that regulate cell survival and proliferation, such as the PI3K/AKT/MTOR and RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathways (Shagisultanova2015Preclinical).

NEDD9 interacts with the mitotic kinase Aurora A, stabilizing it and promoting its activation, which is crucial for proper mitotic progression (Moore2010The). This interaction is significant for cell cycle regulation and is implicated in cancer progression (Shagisultanova2015Preclinical). NEDD9 also associates with SMAD proteins, influencing TGFβ signaling, which is important in cancer metastasis and immune responses (Shagisultanova2015Preclinical).

The protein's stability is regulated by interactions with Smurf2, which affects its polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, highlighting a complex regulatory mechanism that influences NEDD9's role in cellular processes (Moore2010The). These interactions underscore NEDD9's involvement in various signaling networks, contributing to its role in cancer and other diseases.
