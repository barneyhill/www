# L3MBTL3

## Overview
L3MBTL3 is a gene that encodes the L3MBTL histone methyl-lysine binding protein 3, a crucial component in chromatin remodeling and gene regulation. This protein is categorized as a histone methyl-lysine binding protein, characterized by its ability to recognize and bind mono- and dimethylated lysine residues on histone tails, thereby influencing chromatin structure and gene expression (Baughman2015The). The protein's structure includes three MBT (malignant brain tumor) domains, a C-terminal SAM (sterile alpha motif) domain, and zinc finger domains, which collectively facilitate its function in chromatin organization (Hall2022The; James2013Discovery). L3MBTL3 plays a significant role in the repression of Notch signaling by interacting with the transcription factor RBPJ and recruiting lysine demethylase KDM1A to target genes, thus maintaining cellular homeostasis (Xu2017RBPJ). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its association with diseases such as multiple sclerosis and alcohol-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head, highlighting its importance in both normal physiological processes and disease pathogenesis (Alcina2022Identification; Xiong2021Effect).

## Structure
The L3MBTL3 protein is characterized by its complex molecular structure, which includes multiple domains that contribute to its function in chromatin organization and gene regulation. It contains three tandem MBT (malignant brain tumor) domain repeats, which are crucial for recognizing mono- and dimethylated lysine residues on histone tails through an aromatic cage (James2013Discovery; Baughman2015The). These MBT domains are arranged in a triangular configuration on the protein surface, with each domain containing an aromatic cage essential for binding methylated lysine residues (James2013Discovery).

The protein also features a C-terminal SAM (sterile alpha motif) domain, which is involved in multimerization and may contribute to polymer formation (Hall2022The; Baughman2015The). Additionally, L3MBTL3 includes two zinc finger domains and a putative RNA-binding domain, which may play roles in its function (Baughman2015The).

L3MBTL3 functions as a dimer, with dimerization facilitated by interactions within its MBT domains. This dimerization is crucial for its role in recognizing methylated histone tails and is enhanced in the presence of specific ligands such as UNC1215 (Camerino2013The; Baughman2015The). The protein's structure allows for flexibility at the dimer interface, accommodating different ligands by rotating the monomers (Camerino2013The).

## Function
The L3MBTL3 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in chromatin remodeling and gene regulation in healthy human cells. It functions as a histone methyl-lysine binding protein, recognizing mono- and dimethylated lysine residues on histone tails. This recognition is crucial for regulating chromatin structure, which in turn affects gene expression and other chromatin-templated processes such as DNA repair (Baughman2015The). L3MBTL3 operates as a dimer, a formation essential for its ability to engage with methylated histone tails, and this dimerization is facilitated by interactions between its MBT domains (Baughman2015The).

L3MBTL3 is involved in the repression of Notch signaling, a pathway important for cell differentiation and development. It interacts with the transcription factor RBPJ and recruits the lysine demethylase KDM1A to Notch target genes, promoting transcriptional repression (Xu2017RBPJ). This interaction is significant for maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating the transition of chromatin states from active to repressed, particularly when Notch signaling is low or moderate (Xu2017RBPJ).

In the context of organismal outcomes, L3MBTL3 is implicated in normal hematopoiesis and erythrocyte maturation, with its deletion in mice leading to embryonic lethality due to anemia (Hall2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the L3MBTL3 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In the context of multiple sclerosis (MS), a complex demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, the L3MBTL3 gene has been associated with MS risk through specific genetic variants. The variant rs6569648, which tags rs7740107 located in intron 7 of L3MBTL3, is significantly associated with MS. This variant affects the expression and splicing of L3MBTL3, leading to the production of truncated proteins that lack functional domains necessary for interaction with the transcriptional regulator RBPJ, a component of the Notch signaling pathway. This disruption in Notch signaling and potential interference with the homeostasis of SOX2 and DNMT1 proteins may contribute to the pathogenesis of MS (Alcina2022Identification).

In addition to MS, polymorphisms in the L3MBTL3 gene have been linked to alcohol-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) in the Chinese Han population. The rs2068957 polymorphism in L3MBTL3 is associated with an increased risk of this condition under certain genetic models, suggesting a genetic susceptibility component to alcohol-induced ONFH (Xiong2021Effect). These findings highlight the clinical significance of L3MBTL3 in various diseases.

## Interactions
L3MBTL3 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in the repression of Notch signaling. It interacts with the transcription factor RBPJ, a key component of the Notch signaling pathway. This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of the histone demethylase KDM1A (also known as LSD1) to RBPJ-bound enhancers, facilitating the repression of Notch target genes by demethylating H3K4me2, a histone mark associated with active transcription (Xu2017RBPJ).

The interaction between L3MBTL3 and RBPJ is mediated by specific domains within L3MBTL3, including the MBT and SAM domains, which are essential for its binding to RBPJ. Deletion of these domains impairs the interaction, highlighting their importance (Xu2017RBPJ). L3MBTL3 also competes with the Notch intracellular domain (NOTCH ICD) for binding to RBPJ, indicating a regulatory role in modulating Notch signaling (Xu2017RBPJ).

In addition to its interaction with RBPJ, L3MBTL3 has been shown to interact with KDM1A indirectly, as the presence of L3MBTL3 enhances the weak interaction between RBPJ and KDM1A, suggesting that L3MBTL3 acts as a scaffold for this complex (Xu2017RBPJ). These interactions underscore L3MBTL3's role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional repression.
