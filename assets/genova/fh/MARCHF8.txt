# MARCHF8

## Overview
MARCHF8 is a gene that encodes the membrane-associated RING-CH-type finger 8 (MARCH8) protein, which is a member of the E3 ubiquitin ligase family. This protein is characterized by its RING-CH domain, which is essential for its ubiquitin ligase activity, allowing it to interact with E2 enzymes and facilitate the ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation of target proteins (Tada2024Further; Fujita2013Membraneassociated). MARCH8 is involved in regulating the turnover and cell surface expression of various membrane proteins, playing a significant role in cellular homeostasis and immune responses. It is particularly noted for its antiviral activities, including the trapping of viral glycoproteins at the trans-Golgi network and modulating immune responses through its interactions with viral and cellular proteins (Yu2023The). The gene's expression and function have been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer, where it may act as either a tumor promoter or suppressor depending on the context (Chen2021MARCH8; Khalil2023HPV).

## Structure
The MARCHF8 protein, also known as MARCH8, is a member of the E3 ubiquitin ligase family characterized by a RING-CH domain located in the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail. This domain is crucial for its ubiquitin ligase activity, facilitating interactions with E2 enzymes (Tada2024Further; Fujita2013Membraneassociated). MARCH8 also contains two transmembrane domains and two C-terminal tyrosine-based motifs, which are essential for its function, including antiviral activities (Yu2023The). The RING-CH domain is particularly important for the ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation of target proteins, such as the transferrin receptor (TfR) and TRAIL receptor 1 (TRAIL-R1) (Fujita2013Membraneassociated; van2013Ubiquitination).

The protein's structure allows it to interact with various membrane-associated proteins, regulating their turnover and cell surface expression. MARCH8's ability to trap viral glycoproteins at the trans-Golgi network and its involvement in antiviral innate immunity responses are linked to its structural features (Yu2023The). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination, which are critical for its function (van2013Ubiquitination). Splice variant isoforms of MARCH8 can result in structural and functional diversity, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
MARCHF8, also known as MARCH-8, is a membrane-associated E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in the ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation of various membrane proteins, playing a crucial role in regulating their cell surface expression. In healthy human cells, MARCHF8 targets the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor 1 (TRAIL-R1) for ubiquitination, leading to its down-regulation from the cell surface. This process modulates apoptosis signaling pathways, impacting the sensitivity of cells to TRAIL receptor-targeted therapies (van2013Ubiquitination).

MARCHF8 also regulates the transferrin receptor (TfR), which is essential for iron uptake in cells. By ubiquitinating TfR, MARCHF8 facilitates its lysosomal degradation, thereby controlling iron homeostasis and receptor recycling processes (Fujita2013Membraneassociated). The protein is active in the endoplasmic reticulum and other membrane-associated cellular locations, where it interacts with the transmembrane domains of its substrates to mediate their ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (Fujita2013Membraneassociated).

Through these activities, MARCHF8 plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating the turnover of key membrane proteins, thereby influencing various cellular processes and organismal outcomes.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MARCHF8 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In HPV-positive head and neck cancer (HNC), MARCHF8 is upregulated, leading to the degradation of death receptors such as FAS, TRAIL-R1, and TRAIL-R2, which inhibits apoptosis and promotes cancer cell survival. This upregulation is driven by HPV oncoproteins E6 and E7, which activate the MARCHF8 promoter through the MYC/MAX transcriptional complex. Knockdown of MARCHF8 in these cancer cells restores the expression of death receptors and enhances apoptosis, suggesting its role as a tumor promoter in HPV-related cancers (Khalil2023HPV).

In contrast, MARCHF8 appears to function as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer. It is significantly downregulated in breast tumors, and its expression is associated with better overall survival in breast cancer patients. MARCHF8 promotes the degradation of oncogenic proteins such as CD44 and STAT3, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation and metastasis. Overexpression of MARCHF8 in breast cancer cells increases apoptosis and reduces metastatic potential, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in breast cancer (Chen2021MARCH8). These findings indicate that MARCHF8 may have differential roles in cancer development depending on the cancer type.

## Interactions
MARCHF8, a member of the membrane-associated RING-CH (MARCH) family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, participates in various protein interactions that influence its regulatory functions. It interacts with the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP), targeting it for ubiquitination and degradation, which negatively regulates IL-1β-induced NF-κB activation and MAPK signaling pathways (Chen2012The). MARCHF8 also interacts with death receptors such as FAS, TRAIL-R1, and TRAIL-R2, leading to their ubiquitination and degradation, which inhibits apoptosis in HPV-positive head and neck cancer cells (Khalil2023HPV).

In the context of viral infections, MARCHF8 forms a complex with HSC70 and the SVCV G protein, facilitating the lysosomal degradation of the viral protein through K63-linked ubiquitination (Li2021HSC70). MARCHF8 also targets viral envelope glycoproteins for degradation or intracellular sequestration, impacting viral infections such as those caused by HIV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and Ebola virus (Yu2023The). These interactions highlight MARCHF8's role in modulating immune responses and cellular processes through its ubiquitin ligase activity.
