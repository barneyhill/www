# JRKL

## Overview
The JRKL gene encodes the Jerky protein, which is characterized by its unique RNA and DNA binding capabilities. Jerky is primarily recognized for its role as an RNA-binding protein, utilizing helix-turn-helix/homeodomain-like motifs to interact with specific mRNA targets. These motifs, located in the N-terminal region of the protein, enable high-affinity binding despite the absence of conventional RNA binding domains (Liu2003The). The protein's RNA binding domain shares structural similarities with the DNA binding domain of centromere-binding protein B (CENP-B), facilitating its dual binding ability, although it exhibits a preference for RNA (Liu2003The). Jerky's interactions with mRNAs involved in critical cellular processes, such as ribosome assembly and stress response, underscore its potential regulatory functions, particularly within neuronal cells (Liu2003The).

## Interactions
The JRKL gene encodes the Jerky protein, which is involved in interactions with both RNA and DNA. Jerky is known for its RNA binding properties, utilizing tandemly arranged helix-turn-helix/homeodomain-like motifs located in its N-terminal 168 residues. These motifs are crucial for high-affinity binding to specific sets of mRNAs, despite the absence of traditional RNA binding motifs (Liu2003The). Jerky's RNA binding domain shares homology with the DNA binding domain of centromere-binding protein B (CENP-B), allowing it to bind both RNA and DNA, although it shows a stronger affinity for RNA (Liu2003The).

In cellular contexts, Jerky has been shown to interact with mRNAs involved in ribosome assembly, cellular stress response, and cytoskeletal functions. These interactions were identified through immunoprecipitation and microarray analyses, which revealed that Jerky binds to a significant number of mRNAs, including those encoding GAPDH, SOD1, and ribosomal proteins (Liu2003The). The protein's ability to bind specific mRNA targets suggests a regulatory role in mRNA availability and translation, particularly in neuronal cells (Liu2003The).
