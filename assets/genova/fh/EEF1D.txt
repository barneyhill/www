# EEF1D

## Overview
The EEF1D gene encodes the eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 delta (eEF1D), a critical component of the eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 complex (eEF1H), which is essential for protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. The eEF1D protein functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and is involved in the elongation phase of translation by facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP on eEF1A, thereby promoting the delivery of aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome. This protein is categorized as a translation elongation factor and is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, although its splice variant, eEF1BδL, can function as a transcription factor in the nucleus. The EEF1D gene is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that participate in diverse cellular processes, including cell growth and proliferation. Dysregulation of EEF1D expression has been implicated in various cancers, where it can influence tumor progression and patient prognosis (Le2006eEF1B:; Kaitsuka2015Regulation; Cristiano2022The).

## Structure
The EEF1D gene encodes the eukaryotic elongation factor 1Bδ (eEF1Bδ) and its splice variant eEF1BδL, which arise from alternative splicing. The canonical eEF1Bδ protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and functions as a translation elongation factor, forming a complex with eEF1Bα, eEF1Bγ, and valine-tRNA synthetase. It acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for eEF1A and contains a leucine-zipper motif, suggesting a role in protein interactions (Le2006eEF1B:; Kaitsuka2015Regulation). The eEF1BδL variant includes an additional 367 amino acids at the N-terminus, contains a nuclear localization signal, and functions as a transcription factor for heat-shock responsive genes (Kaitsuka2015Regulation; McLachlan2018The).

Structurally, eEF1Bδ comprises two domains: a C-terminal domain similar to eEF1Bα, involved in nucleotide exchange activity, and an N-terminal domain featuring a leucine zipper motif, which is unusually long with 5-6 repeats, suggesting a role in protein dimerization (Le2006eEF1B:). The eEF1B complex, including eEF1Bδ, forms a stable heterotrimeric complex with eEF1Bα and eEF1Bγ, with eEF1Bβ self-associating into a stable trimer through its leucine-zipper motif (Bondarchuk2022Quaternary). The protein is phosphorylated by CK2, and its interaction with eEF1A does not mask the CK2 phosphorylation site (Le2006eEF1B:).

## Function
The EEF1D gene encodes a subunit of the eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 complex (eEF1H), which is essential for the elongation step of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. This complex plays a critical role in the delivery of aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome, facilitating the addition of amino acids to the growing polypeptide chain during translation. EEF1D specifically collaborates with other components of the eEF1H complex, such as eEF1B2, to convert eEF1A from its inactive GDP-bound form to its active GTP-bound form, a process crucial for efficient protein biosynthesis (Cristiano2022The).

In healthy human cells, EEF1D is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to cell growth and proliferation by ensuring the proper functioning of protein synthesis. The gene produces several protein isoforms through alternative splicing, allowing it to participate in various cellular processes. The activity of EEF1D is vital for maintaining the balance of protein production, which is necessary for normal cellular function and organismal development (Thornton2003Not; Cristiano2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the EEF1D gene have been implicated in various cancers. In glioma, lower expression levels of EEF1D are associated with shorter survival periods, indicating a poor prognosis, while in hepatocellular carcinoma, lower expression correlates with better survival outcomes (BitergeSut2019Alterations). In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), EEF1D is overexpressed compared to healthy tissue, promoting cell proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which are critical for tumorigenesis (Flores2016EEF1D). High EEF1D expression in OSCC is linked to poorer disease-specific survival, making it a significant prognostic marker (Domingueti2020Eukaryotic).

EEF1D overexpression is also observed in osteosarcoma, where it facilitates tumor growth through the Akt-mTOR and Akt-Bad signaling pathways, correlating with advanced disease stages and recurrence (Cheng2018EEF1D). In ovarian cancer, EEF1D contributes to chemotherapy resistance by activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Knocking down EEF1D enhances sensitivity to cisplatin, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target to improve treatment outcomes (Xu2022Interfering). In esophageal carcinoma, high EEF1D expression is associated with lymph node metastasis and reduced survival rates, highlighting its role in aggressive disease progression (Ogawa2004Clinical).

## Interactions
EEF1D, also known as eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 delta, is a component of the eEF1B complex, which plays a crucial role in protein synthesis. EEF1D interacts with other subunits of the eEF1B complex, including eEF1Bα (EEF1B2) and eEF1Bγ (EEF1G), forming a multiprotein complex that facilitates the exchange of guanosine diphosphate (GDP) for guanosine triphosphate (GTP) on eEF1A, a process essential for translation elongation (Le2006eEF1B:; Negrutskii2020Nontranslational).

The N-terminal domain of EEF1D contains a leucine zipper motif, which is involved in protein dimerization and oligomerization, allowing EEF1D to form dimers or higher-order structures. This domain also interacts with the N-terminal domain of eEF1Bγ, indicating that eEF1Bγ has distinct binding sites for eEF1Bα and eEF1D, enabling simultaneous binding of these subunits (Le2006eEF1B:).

EEF1D is also implicated in interactions beyond the eEF1B complex. It has been shown to bind to Val-RS, a valine-tRNA synthetase, which is part of the eEF1B complex in metazoans (Le2006eEF1B:). Additionally, EEF1D may participate in regulatory processes affecting translation efficiency and has been associated with DNA damage checkpoints, suggesting potential interactions with nucleic acids (Le2006eEF1B:).
