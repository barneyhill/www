# ARMH3

## Overview
ARMH3, or armadillo-like helical domain containing 3, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several key cellular processes, including signal transduction and cell adhesion. The ARMH3 protein is characterized by its armadillo-like helical domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions essential for maintaining cellular structure and communication. Notably, ARMH3 plays a significant role in the regulation of the cGAS-MITA/STING pathway, a crucial component of the innate immune response to DNA viruses (Hu2023Mitochondrial). Additionally, ARMH3 interacts with PI4KB, a phosphoinositide kinase, enhancing its activity and implicating ARMH3 in membrane trafficking and cytokinesis (Burke2022Beyond). The protein's interactions and regulatory functions suggest its involvement in various cellular and pathological contexts, including its potential impact on diseases such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and leukemia (Carreras2020A; Cigler2024Orpinolide).

## Structure


## Function
ARMH3, or armadillo-like helical domain containing 3, is a protein involved in several cellular processes, including signal transduction and cell adhesion. Proteins with armadillo-like domains, such as ARMH3, are known for their role in protein-protein interactions, which are crucial for maintaining cellular structure and facilitating communication between cells. ARMH3 is implicated in the regulation of the cGAS-MITA/STING pathway, which is part of the innate immune response. This pathway is activated in response to DNA viruses and involves the expression of type I interferons and other antiviral genes. ARMH3 is noted as a critical factor in the trafficking and activation of MITA/STING, although its specific function in healthy human cells is not fully detailed (Hu2023Mitochondrial).

In addition to its role in immune response, ARMH3 interacts with PI4KB, a phosphoinositide kinase, at the Golgi and trans-Golgi network (TGN). This interaction enhances PI4KB activity, which is important for membrane trafficking and cytokinesis. ARMH3 acts as a positive regulator of PI4KB, suggesting its involvement in cellular processes related to membrane dynamics (Burke2022Beyond).

## Clinical Significance
The ARMH3 gene, also known as C10orf76, has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In the context of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), high expression of ARMH3 has been associated with a poor prognosis, indicating a positive correlation with a higher probability of death. This suggests that ARMH3 plays a significant role in the stratification of high-risk groups in lymphoma subtypes (Carreras2020A).

In leukemia, ARMH3 is crucial for maintaining phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) signaling between the endoplasmic reticulum and the trans-Golgi network. This signaling is essential for the antiproliferative effects of the compound W7 in leukemia cells. A genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen identified ARMH3 as a key player in the efficacy of W7, highlighting its importance in leukemic vulnerability (Cigler2024Orpinolide).

Additionally, ARMH3 is involved in the chlorination process of melleolide toxins produced by the fungus Armillaria mellea. Although this context is not directly related to human disease, it underscores the gene's role in biochemical pathways (Wick2016A). These findings collectively suggest that ARMH3's expression and interactions are critical in various pathological contexts.

## Interactions
The ARMH3 protein, also known as c10orf76, forms a direct complex with the lipid kinase PI4KB. This interaction is characterized by a disorder-to-order transition in the kinase linker of PI4KB, which is crucial for maintaining phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) levels at the Golgi apparatus. The binding site on PI4KB for c10orf76 can be phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA), which decreases the affinity for c10orf76, indicating a regulatory mechanism (McPhail2019Characterizationa; McPhail2019Characterization).

The c10orf76-PI4KB complex is essential for the recruitment of c10orf76 to the Golgi and for the proper activation of Arf1, a GTPase involved in Golgi function. This interaction is not responsible for PI4KB recruitment to the Golgi; rather, PI4KB recruits c10orf76 (McPhail2019Characterizationa; McPhail2019Characterization). In vitro, c10orf76 decreases PI4KB's lipid kinase activity, but knockout of c10orf76 in cells reduces PI4P levels, suggesting complex regulatory interactions possibly involving other partners like Arf1/GBF1 (McPhail2019Characterization).

The ARMH3 protein does not directly interact with nucleic acids, but its interaction with PI4KB is essential for the regulation of lipid signaling pathways involved in viral replication (McPhail2019Characterization).
