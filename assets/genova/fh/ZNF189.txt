# ZNF189

## Overview
ZNF189 is a human gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 189, a member of the Krüppel-like zinc finger protein family. This protein is characterized by its 16 zinc finger motifs, which facilitate DNA binding, and a KRAB (Krüppel-associated box) domain that is essential for transcriptional repression. Zinc finger protein 189 is primarily involved in transcriptional regulation, influencing the expression of various target genes across different tissues, including skeletal muscle, heart, testis, pancreas, and lymphoid tissues (Odeberg1998Cloning). The gene's expression pattern and evolutionary conservation suggest its significant role in fundamental cellular processes such as development and differentiation (Odeberg1998Cloning). Despite its broad expression, the specific molecular functions of ZNF189 in healthy human cells are not yet fully elucidated (Odeberg1998Cloning).

## Structure
The ZNF189 gene encodes a Krüppel-like zinc finger protein characterized by 16 zinc finger motifs at its C-terminus, which are common to all splice variants (Odeberg1998Cloning). These zinc finger motifs are involved in DNA binding, a typical function of zinc finger proteins. The protein also contains a KRAB A domain at the N-terminus, which is involved in transcriptional repression and consists of approximately 75 amino acids, subdivided into an A box and a B box, with the A box being essential for repression (Odeberg1998Cloning).

The gene is organized into at least four exons, with the large 3' end exon coding for the complete zinc finger domain and the 3' untranslated region (Odeberg1998Cloning). The zinc finger domain is interrupted by a degenerate finger motif between fingers 10 and 11, and a 3-amino-acid insertion between finger motifs 15 and 16 (Odeberg1998Cloning). The KRAB A domain is encoded in exon 3 and is partially truncated in splice variants ZNF189a and ZNF189c, but not in ZNF189d (Odeberg1998Cloning).

ZNF189 exhibits multiple splice variants, including ZNF189a, ZNF189b, ZNF189c, and ZNF189d, each with different structural features (Odeberg1998Cloning). The gene is expressed in various tissues, with strong expression in skeletal muscle, heart, testis, pancreas, and lymphoid tissues (Odeberg1998Cloning).

## Function
ZNF189 is a human gene encoding a Krüppel-like zinc finger protein that plays a role in transcriptional regulation. The protein contains 16 zinc fingers at its C-terminus and a KRAB domain, which is essential for transcriptional repression (Odeberg1998Cloning). ZNF189 is expressed in various tissues, with high levels in skeletal muscle, heart, testis, pancreas, and lymphoid tissues, suggesting its involvement in diverse biological processes (Odeberg1998Cloning).

The zinc finger domain of ZNF189 is involved in DNA binding, which is crucial for its function in transcriptional regulation. This domain allows ZNF189 to interact with specific DNA sequences, modulating the expression of target genes (Odeberg1998Cloning). The gene's expression pattern and conservation across mammalian species indicate its potential importance in fundamental cellular functions, such as development and differentiation (Odeberg1998Cloning).

ZNF189 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences gene expression by binding to DNA and interacting with corepressors through its KRAB domain. This interaction is vital for its role in transcriptional repression, impacting various cellular processes (Odeberg1998Cloning). Despite its broad expression, the specific molecular functions of ZNF189 in healthy human cells remain to be fully characterized (Odeberg1998Cloning).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ZNF189 gene have been implicated in several stress-related disorders. In particular, ZNF189 shows reduced expression in the prefrontal cortex of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), suggesting its potential role in the pathophysiology of depression (Lorsch2018Zfp189). This downregulation is associated with a decrease in stress resilience, as ZNF189 is part of a transcriptional network regulated by CREB, which is crucial for stress resilience (Lorsch2018Zfp189).

In the context of cancer, mutation analysis of the ZNF189 gene in bladder cancer cell lines and tumors has identified polymorphisms and a rare mutation, although these mutations are not significantly associated with bladder cancer predisposition (van2001The). The clinical significance of these findings remains unclear, as mutations in ZNF189 are rare in bladder cancer.

ZNF189 is also involved in the regulation of transposable elements, which may have implications for cocaine use disorder (CUD). Alterations in ZNF189 expression in medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens have been linked to changes in cocaine-related behaviors, suggesting a role in the molecular adaptations to cocaine exposure (Silva2024Regulation).
