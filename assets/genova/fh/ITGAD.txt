# ITGAD

## Overview
The ITGAD gene encodes the integrin subunit alpha D, a component of the β2 integrin family, which plays a pivotal role in immune cell function. Integrin subunit alpha D, when paired with the beta 2 subunit, forms the integrin αDβ2, a type I transmembrane receptor involved in cell adhesion and integrin-mediated signaling. This protein is crucial for various immune processes, including cell migration, phagocytosis, and the immune response, thereby contributing to inflammation and tissue repair (Blythe2021β2; Zhao2022LINC02190). The integrin αDβ2 is expressed predominantly in leukocytes and is implicated in interactions with the extracellular matrix, influencing cellular signaling pathways and immune cell behavior. Its expression and function are also significant in pathological contexts, such as cancer, where it may interact with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, suggesting a role in the immune microenvironment of tumors (Wu2020Integrated).

## Structure
The ITGAD gene encodes the integrin alpha D subunit, which is part of the β2 integrin family. This integrin is a heterodimeric type I transmembrane protein composed of a variable alpha chain (CD11d) and a common beta chain (CD18) (Blythe2021β2). The primary structure of CD11d includes a conserved GFFKR motif and a +2 tyrosine residue, which are involved in conformational changes (Blythe2021β2). The ligand-binding α-I domain contains the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) and the socket for isoleucine (SILEN) motifs, crucial for maintaining its inactive conformation (Blythe2021β2).

The secondary structure involves motifs such as MIDAS and SILEN, which influence the position of the α7 helix, affecting the integrin's open and closed conformations (Blythe2021β2). The tertiary structure is regulated by conserved motifs that maintain the association of the CD11 and CD18 cytosolic tails in the inactive state (Blythe2021β2). 

In terms of quaternary structure, CD11d forms a complex with the CD18 subunit, and its expression is dependent on the coexpression with CD18, as CD11d is retained in the trans-Golgi network without it (Blythe2021β2). Post-translational modifications include phosphorylation, particularly at a putative CK2 site, which plays a role in integrin activation and signaling (Blythe2021β2). CD11d has two isoforms due to alternative splicing, with the short isoform lacking a glutamine residue (Blythe2021β2).

## Function
ITGAD encodes the integrin alpha D subunit, which pairs with the beta 2 subunit to form the integrin αDβ2. This protein is primarily involved in cell adhesion and integrin-mediated signaling processes, particularly in immune cells such as leukocytes. It plays a crucial role in cell migration, phagocytosis, and the immune response, contributing to inflammation and tissue repair. ITGAD is involved in cell-matrix adhesion, which is essential for various cellular processes, including the immune response and tissue remodeling (Zhao2022LINC02190).

In the context of ovarian cancer, ITGAD, along with other integrins, may function as part of heterodimeric receptors associated with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), suggesting its involvement in immune-related processes (Wu2020Integrated). The expression of ITGAD is also significant in the endometrium, where it is primarily located in the glandular and luminal epithelia and is co-located with E-cadherin, an epithelial marker. This localization indicates its role in cell adhesion during embryo implantation, although its specific function in healthy human cells is not directly addressed (Zhao2022LINC02190). The integrin αDβ2 is active in the cell membrane, where it mediates interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix, influencing cellular signaling pathways and immune cell behavior.

## Interactions
ITGAD, or integrin subunit alpha D, is known to participate in various interactions that are crucial for its function in cell adhesion and signaling. In the context of natural killer (NK) cells, ITGAD is associated with increased adhesion to extracellular matrix components and is involved in inside-out signaling-dependent cytokine secretion and homing to inflammatory sites (Solloa2020Differential). This suggests that ITGAD plays a role in mediating interactions with the extracellular matrix and possibly other cell surface receptors.

In ovarian cancer, ITGAD has been shown to have a significant correlation with ITGB2, indicating a potential role in forming heterodimeric receptors that may be associated with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and could function in immune response or cancer progression (Wu2020Integrated). This interaction highlights the importance of ITGAD in the immune microenvironment of cancerous tissues.

Additionally, ITGAD is part of a protein-protein interaction network involving integrin subunits such as ITGA4, ITGAL, ITGAM, and ITGAX, which are enriched in processes like cell-cell adhesion, T-cell activation, and leukocyte adhesion (Selim2023Association). These interactions underscore the role of ITGAD in immune cell function and its potential involvement in various signaling pathways.
