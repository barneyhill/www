# SQSTM1

## Overview
The SQSTM1 gene encodes the protein sequestosome 1, commonly referred to as p62, which is a multifunctional scaffold protein involved in various cellular processes, including autophagy, signal transduction, and the oxidative stress response. As a selective autophagy receptor, p62 plays a pivotal role in targeting ubiquitinated proteins and damaged organelles for degradation, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis. The protein is characterized by several functional domains, such as the Phox1 and Bem1p (PB1) domain, ZZ-type zinc finger (ZZ) domain, and ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids (Chen2020p62SQSTM1; SánchezMartín2018p62SQSTM1). p62 is also involved in critical signaling pathways, including the NF-κB and Keap1-Nrf2 pathways, influencing immune responses and oxidative stress regulation (SánchezMartín2018p62SQSTM1). Mutations in SQSTM1 have been associated with various diseases, such as Paget's disease of bone and certain neurodegenerative disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (Muto2018Biallelic; Hocking2002Domain-specific).

## Structure
The SQSTM1 gene encodes the p62 protein, a multifunctional scaffold protein involved in various cellular processes. The protein is composed of 440 amino acids and contains several key domains that contribute to its function. These include the Phox1 and Bem1p (PB1) domain, a ZZ-type zinc finger (ZZ) domain, a tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6)-binding (TB) motif, an LC3-interacting region (LIR) domain, a Keap1-interacting region (KIR) domain, and a C-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain (Chen2020p62SQSTM1; SánchezMartín2018p62SQSTM1).

The PB1 domain is crucial for protein dimerization and oligomerization, forming flexible filamentous assemblies that contribute to the formation of p62 bodies, which are involved in autophagy (Berkamp2020Structure). The ZZ domain acts as a multi-protein and RNA interaction hub, binding to zinc atoms and interacting with proteins like RIP1 and RNAs such as Vault-RNA-1 (Berkamp2020Structure). The UBA domain is essential for recognizing polyubiquitin and ubiquitinated cargo, facilitating their degradation through autophagy (Berkamp2020Structure; SánchezMartín2018p62SQSTM1).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, regulate the function of p62, affecting its role in autophagy and cellular stress responses (SánchezMartín2018p62SQSTM1). The protein also undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in variants that may alter its interaction with other proteins and its functional roles (SánchezMartín2018p62SQSTM1).

## Function
SQSTM1, also known as sequestosome 1, encodes the multifunctional protein p62, which plays a critical role in autophagy, a cellular process for degrading and recycling cellular components. In healthy human cells, p62 functions as a selective autophagy receptor, targeting ubiquitinated proteins and damaged organelles for degradation. It interacts with ubiquitinated cargoes through its C-terminal UBA domain and binds to ATG8 family proteins via the LC3-interacting region (LIR), facilitating the delivery of cargo to autophagosomes (Lamark2017Regulation; SánchezMartín2018p62SQSTM1).

p62 is involved in the regulation of the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway, which is crucial for the oxidative stress response. Under stress conditions, p62 is phosphorylated, disrupting the Keap1-Nrf2 interaction and stabilizing Nrf2, which translocates to the nucleus to activate target genes (SánchezMartín2018p62SQSTM1). p62 also plays a role in mitochondrial function and energy metabolism, particularly under conditions of increased energy demand, by regulating mitochondrial gene expression related to oxidative phosphorylation (Poon2021The).

In addition to its role in autophagy, p62 is involved in signaling pathways such as NF-κB activation, which is important for immune responses and inflammation. It acts as an adaptor protein, linking ubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome for degradation, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis (SánchezMartín2018p62SQSTM1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SQSTM1 gene are linked to several diseases, most notably Paget's disease of bone (PDB), a disorder characterized by increased and disorganized bone turnover. Mutations in the ubiquitin-binding domain of SQSTM1, such as the P392L mutation, are common in both familial and sporadic cases of PDB, highlighting the gene's significant role in the disease's pathogenesis (Hocking2002Domain-specific).

SQSTM1 mutations also contribute to neurodegenerative disorders. A study identified a homozygous frameshift variant in SQSTM1 in an Iranian family, leading to a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by symptoms like ataxia, cognitive decline, and behavioral abnormalities. This mutation impairs autophagic flux and protein aggregate clearance, suggesting a role for SQSTM1 in maintaining neuronal health (Muto2018Biallelic).

In cancer, SQSTM1/p62 is implicated in various malignancies, acting as both an oncogene and a tumor suppressor depending on the context. It is often upregulated in cancers such as gastric, colorectal, and pancreatic, where it is associated with tumor aggression and metastasis. Its expression levels can influence prognosis and drug sensitivity, making it a potential target for therapeutic strategies (Tang2021Sequestosome).

## Interactions
SQSTM1, also known as p62, is a multifunctional protein that interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in cellular processes such as autophagy and signal transduction. It interacts with the motor protein dynein, essential for retrograde transport along microtubules. This interaction is critical for the transport of misfolded proteins and late endosomes to degradation centers, and the absence of SQSTM1 impairs dynein function, leading to the accumulation of protein aggregates associated with neurodegenerative diseases (CalderillaBarbosa2014Interaction).

SQSTM1 also interacts with HDAC6, a protein involved in the degradation of polyubiquitylated protein aggregates. This interaction is crucial for regulating microtubule acetylation, affecting intracellular trafficking (CalderillaBarbosa2014Interaction). Additionally, SQSTM1 forms a complex with HSPB1 and mutant huntingtin protein, facilitating the unconventional secretion and transcellular spreading of the mutant protein, which is significant in the context of Huntington's disease (Bonavita2023The).

The protein's UBA domain allows it to bind ubiquitylated substrates, and it interacts with proteins like LC3, KEAP1, and TRAF6, influencing processes such as autophagy, oxidative stress response, and NF-κB signaling (Berkamp2020Structure; Rondón2023Proximity).
