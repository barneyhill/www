# CCDC115

## Overview
The CCDC115 gene encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 115 protein, which is a crucial component of the vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) complex. This protein functions as an assembly factor for V-ATPase, playing a significant role in endosomal acidification, a process vital for cellular nutrient uptake, particularly iron and heme, in erythroid cells (Sobh2020Genetic). The CCDC115 protein is involved in the regulation of intracellular iron levels and is essential for processes such as transferrin-bound iron uptake and heme trafficking, which are critical for erythroid differentiation and cellular growth (Sobh2020Genetic). Additionally, CCDC115 interacts with viral proteins, such as the classical swine fever virus glycoprotein E2, influencing viral replication and virulence (Vuono2020Swine). Mutations in the CCDC115 gene are linked to a congenital disorder of glycosylation, CCDC115-CDG, characterized by defects in glycoprotein biosynthesis and a spectrum of clinical symptoms, including severe liver disease and neurological manifestations (PérezCerdá2017A; Girard2018CCDC115CDG:).

## Function
The CCDC115 gene encodes a protein that functions as a vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) assembly factor, playing a crucial role in endosomal acidification. This process is essential for the release of free iron from internalized transferrin, which is critical for cellular nutrient uptake, including iron and heme, particularly in erythroid cells (Sobh2020Genetic). CCDC115 is involved in the uptake of transferrin-bound iron (TBI) and is a determinant of heme trafficking, affecting the induction of globin genes and the intracellular distribution of heme (Sobh2020Genetic).

In erythroid cells, CCDC115 is implicated in the modulation of iron and heme uptake, influencing erythroid differentiation and cellular growth dependent on TBI (Sobh2020Genetic). The protein is also associated with Golgi trafficking and protein glycosylation, contributing to the regulation of intracellular iron levels and maintaining iron homeostasis (Sobh2020Genetic). CCDC115's role in endosomal acidification and vesicular transport is vital for heme distribution and erythroid differentiation, highlighting its importance in cellular and organismal iron metabolism (Sobh2020Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CCDC115 gene are associated with a congenital disorder of glycosylation known as CCDC115-CDG, or CDG type IIo. This rare genetic condition is characterized by defects in glycoprotein biosynthesis, leading to a range of clinical symptoms. Patients with CCDC115-CDG often present with severe liver disease, including early and severe liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatosplenomegaly. Neurological symptoms can vary from mild to severe, including progressive myoclonic dystonia and hypotonia (PérezCerdá2017A; Girard2018CCDC115CDG:).

Biochemical abnormalities in affected individuals include hypercholesterolemia, elevated liver enzymes, and hypoceruloplasminemia. These symptoms can mimic other conditions such as Wilson disease, making diagnosis challenging (Espinós2020Are; Girard2018CCDC115CDG:). The CCDC115 protein is involved in the assembly of the V-ATPase proton pump, and mutations may disrupt Golgi apparatus lumen acidification, leading to glycosylation defects (Girard2018CCDC115CDG:).

The clinical presentation of CCDC115-CDG can also include nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) phenotype, characterized by hepatic fat accumulation and potential progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (Jansen2018NAFLD). Screening for CDG is recommended in patients with unexplained liver disease and related metabolic disturbances (Girard2018CCDC115CDG:).

## Interactions
CCDC115 is known to interact with the classical swine fever virus (CSFV) structural glycoprotein E2. This interaction was initially identified using a yeast two-hybrid approach and confirmed through a proximity ligation assay in CSFV-infected swine cells. The interaction involves noncontinuous binding areas in the E2 protein, and specific amino acid residues in E2, such as K112M, N260I, and M275S, are crucial for this interaction. Disruption of the E2-CCDC115 interaction through these mutations results in reduced virus replication and virulence, particularly in swine macrophages (Vuono2020Swine).

In addition to its role in viral interactions, CCDC115 is a component of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) complex, which is essential for endosomal acidification. This function is critical for processes such as transferrin-bound iron uptake and heme trafficking in erythroid cells. CCDC115's involvement in these processes suggests it may interact with other V-ATPase subunits, although specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids in this context are not detailed in the available sources (Sobh2020Genetic).
