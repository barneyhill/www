# SGCB

## Overview
The SGCB gene encodes the beta-sarcoglycan protein, a transmembrane protein that is an integral component of the sarcoglycan complex within the dystrophin-associated protein complex. This complex is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of muscle cells by linking the intracellular cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix, thereby stabilizing the muscle cell membrane during contraction and relaxation (Henriques2018Different; Li2023Comprehensive). The beta-sarcoglycan protein interacts with other sarcoglycan proteins, including alpha-, gamma-, and delta-sarcoglycan, to form a functional unit that is crucial for muscle function and integrity (Li2023Comprehensive). Mutations in the SGCB gene can lead to limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2E (LGMD2E), a condition characterized by progressive muscle weakness and degeneration (Antonio2023A). Understanding the structure and function of the SGCB gene and its encoded protein is vital for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying muscular dystrophies and developing potential therapeutic strategies (Li2023Comprehensive).

## Structure
The SGCB (sarcoglycan beta) protein is a component of the sarcoglycan complex, which plays a crucial role in muscle function. The primary structure of SGCB consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that form part of the dystrophin-associated protein complex, essential for connecting the intracellular cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix (Li2023Comprehensive). The secondary structure of SGCB includes α helices and β sheets, with the β sheets being particularly significant as they contain amino acids with inward-facing side chains that are more prone to deleterious changes (Li2023Comprehensive). 

The tertiary structure of SGCB is not fully resolved, but it is known to form a triple-helical quaternary structure when interacting with other sarcoglycan proteins, such as SGCA, SGCD, and SGCG. This interaction is critical for the stability and function of the sarcoglycan complex (Li2023Comprehensive). SGCB also contains an EGF-like domain, which is a common feature among β-, γ-, and δ-sarcoglycans (Soheili2011Rescue). Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, occur in the extracellular domain, which contains N-glycosylation sites and conserved cysteine residues (Soheili2011Rescue).

## Function
The SGCB gene encodes the beta-sarcoglycan protein, a crucial component of the sarcoglycan complex, which is part of the dystrophin-associated protein complex in muscle cells. This complex plays a vital role in linking the intracellular cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix, thereby stabilizing the muscle cell membrane during contraction and protecting it from damage (Henriques2018Different; Li2023Comprehensive). The sarcoglycan complex is composed of four single-pass transmembrane proteins: alpha-sarcoglycan, beta-sarcoglycan, gamma-sarcoglycan, and delta-sarcoglycan. These proteins assemble and translocate within the myofiber as a complex, ensuring proper cell surface expression, which is essential for muscle function (Li2023Comprehensive).

In healthy human cells, the SGCB protein is robustly expressed in skeletal muscle and contributes to maintaining the integrity of muscle cell membranes. It interacts with the dystroglycan complex, linking the subsarcolemmal protein dystrophin to the basement membrane, which is crucial for maintaining muscle membrane integrity during contraction and relaxation (Magri2022Antisense; Henriques2018Different). Proper function of the SGCB gene ensures the stability and proper localization of the sarcoglycan complex at the muscle membrane, contributing to muscle integrity and function (Henriques2018Different).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SGCB gene are associated with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2E (LGMD2E), also known as LGMDR4/2E. This condition is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting, particularly affecting the muscles around the hips and shoulders, and can lead to premature death (Antonio2023A; Li2023Comprehensive). The SGCB gene encodes the beta-sarcoglycan protein, a component of the sarcoglycan complex crucial for muscle fiber stability. Mutations in SGCB disrupt the function of this complex, leading to muscle degeneration (Antonio2023A).

Various types of mutations in SGCB, including missense, nonsense, and splice-site mutations, have been identified. Missense mutations can impair sarcolemmal localization and sarcoglycan complex formation, affecting muscle function (Li2023Comprehensive). Splice-site mutations can lead to aberrant splicing events, resulting in frameshift mutations and the absence of beta-sarcoglycan expression due to nonsense-mediated decay (Xie2022First). A specific mutation, c.544 T > G, has been identified as a founder mutation in the Indian population, leading to sarcoglycanopathy (Sanga2023Identification).

Research indicates that the severity of LGMD2E correlates with the functional impact of specific SGCB variants, with certain mutations leading to more severe disease progression (Li2023Comprehensive).

## Interactions
SGCB (sarcoglycan beta) is a critical component of the sarcoglycan complex, which is part of the larger dystrophin-associated protein complex. This complex plays a vital role in linking the intracellular cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix in muscle cells, thereby stabilizing the muscle cell membrane during contraction (Li2023Comprehensive). SGCB interacts with other sarcoglycan proteins, including α-sarcoglycan (SGCA), γ-sarcoglycan (SGCG), and δ-sarcoglycan (SGCD), forming a transmembrane complex that localizes to the sarcolemma (Li2023Comprehensive).

The interactions between SGCB and other sarcoglycan proteins are crucial for the structural integrity and function of the sarcoglycan complex. Pathogenic variants in SGCB can disrupt these interactions, leading to decreased cell surface expression of the complex and contributing to muscular dystrophy (Li2023Comprehensive). Specific amino acid positions, such as R91, are critical for maintaining the protein's function and orientation within the membrane, affecting its interactions with SGCD and SGCG (Li2023Comprehensive). The structural analysis of SGCB has revealed that interprotein contacts, particularly between SGCB and SGCD or SGCG, are essential for its function, with damaging mutations often residing in β sheets involved in these contacts (Li2023Comprehensive).
