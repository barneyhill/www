# VWA5B1

## Overview
VWA5B1 is a gene that encodes the protein von Willebrand factor A domain containing 5B1, which is part of the von Willebrand factor A (VWFA) domain-containing protein family. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion and signaling, due to its structural domains that facilitate interactions with other cellular components. The VWA5B1 protein is implicated in several biological pathways and has been associated with various diseases, including diabetic kidney disease, cognitive dysfunction, schizophrenia, and prostate cancer. Its expression levels and regulatory mechanisms suggest a significant role in disease pathogenesis and progression, making it a potential biomarker for certain conditions (Wei2022Deep; Huang2017A; Peng2024Identification).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
VWA5B1 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through its altered expression and involvement in various biological pathways. In diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and cognitive dysfunction, VWA5B1 is identified as a common biomarker. Its expression is altered in these conditions, suggesting a role in their pathogenesis (Peng2024Identification). Low expression of VWA5B1 is associated with pathways related to basal cell carcinoma, hematopoietic cell lineage, cytokine receptor interaction, and other immune-related pathways, indicating its potential involvement in these diseases (Peng2024Identification).

In the context of schizophrenia, VWA5B1 is among the genes regulated by UPF3B, with alterations in its expression linked to the disease. This association is highlighted in studies using Upf3b-null mouse models, which suggest that VWA5B1 may be involved in the molecular mechanisms underlying neural diseases (Huang2017A).

In prostate cancer, VWA5B1 is significantly up-regulated in patients with a high risk of relapse, indicating its potential as a biomarker for predicting or preventing relapse in this cancer type (Wei2022Deep). These findings suggest that VWA5B1 may play a role in cancer progression and relapse risk.
