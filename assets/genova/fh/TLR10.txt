# TLR10

## Overview
TLR10, or Toll-like receptor 10, is a gene that encodes a member of the Toll-like receptor family, which plays a crucial role in the innate immune system. The protein product, toll-like receptor 10, is a transmembrane receptor primarily expressed on B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Unlike other TLRs, TLR10 is unique for its anti-inflammatory properties, acting as a negative regulator of immune responses. It modulates immune signaling pathways by inhibiting cytokine production, particularly through interactions with TLR2 ligands, and is involved in maintaining immune homeostasis. TLR10's ability to form homodimers and heterodimers, especially with TLR2, further influences its functional dynamics. The receptor's engagement leads to the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1 receptor antagonist, and affects the activation and differentiation of immune cells. Genetic variations in TLR10 have been associated with several diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, asthma, and Meniere's disease, highlighting its clinical significance in immune regulation and disease susceptibility (Oosting2014Human; Chuang2001Identification; Henrick2019TLR10).

## Structure
TLR10 is a member of the Toll-like receptor family, characterized by its molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. The primary structure of TLR10 consists of 811 amino acids, featuring a signal peptide, multiple leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), a cysteine-rich domain, a transmembrane domain, and a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) cytoplasmic domain (Chuang2001Identification). The secondary structure includes 19 LRR motifs forming a solenoid structure, which is crucial for its function in immune sensing (Guan2010Human). The tertiary structure of TLR10 is described as a 'horseshoe-like' shape, typical of TLRs, with 19 parallel beta-strands and diverse secondary structures, including 11 alpha helices and three 3_10 helices (Govindaraj2010Molecular).

In terms of quaternary structure, TLR10 can form homodimers and heterodimers, particularly with TLR2, in a ligand-dependent manner (Govindaraj2010Molecular; Guan2010Human). The TIR domain of TLR10 shares a conserved fold with TLR1 and TLR2, consisting of five parallel beta-sheets surrounded by five alpha-helical segments, which are crucial for dimer formation and adaptor recruitment (Guan2010Human). Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation are predicted at specific LRRs, although they do not contribute to dimerization or ligand binding (Govindaraj2010Molecular).

## Function
TLR10 (Toll-like receptor 10) functions as an anti-inflammatory pattern-recognition receptor in human cells. It is primarily expressed on B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, where it activates gene transcription through the MyD88 pathway, a common signaling route for TLRs (Hasan2005Human). TLR10 is unique among TLRs due to its inhibitory properties, contrasting with the typically pro-inflammatory nature of other TLRs. It modulates immune responses by inhibiting TLR2-mediated cytokine production, likely through interactions with TLR2 ligands (Oosting2014Human).

TLR10's engagement leads to the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), which downregulates excessive cytokine responses, maintaining immune homeostasis (Oosting2014Human). This receptor also suppresses the activation and differentiation of monocytes, affecting dendritic cell-mediated adaptive immune responses. This suppression is evidenced by reduced expression of maturation markers and decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine production (Hess2017TLR10).

TLR10 acts as a broad negative regulator of TLR signaling, affecting both MyD88-dependent and TRIF-dependent pathways, thereby controlling immune responses in vivo (Jiang2016TLR10). Its role in immune modulation suggests potential implications for conditions involving immune dysregulation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TLR10 gene have been associated with various diseases and conditions. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the TLR10 variant I473T is linked to more severe disease manifestations, particularly in seropositive patients. This variant is associated with a lower response to infliximab treatment and fails to inhibit the NFkB inflammatory pathway, leading to increased NFkB activity and potentially contributing to RA severity (Torices2016A).

In Crohn's disease, genetic variations within TLR10 have been identified as contributing factors to disease susceptibility and clinical outcomes. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes in TLR10 are associated with Crohn's disease in a New Zealand population (Morgan2012Genetic).

TLR10 polymorphisms have also been linked to asthma, with specific SNPs showing significant associations with the disease. These genetic variations may influence asthma susceptibility by affecting TLR10 signaling and its role in innate immunity (Lazarus2004TOLLlike).

Additionally, TLR10 variants have been implicated in Meniere's disease, particularly in cases with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss and a history of autoimmune conditions (Requena2013Allelic). In obesity, TLR10 is suggested to play a role in adipose tissue inflammation and metabolic regulation, potentially influencing insulin sensitivity and adipocyte morphology (Boutens2018A).

## Interactions
TLR10 interacts with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in an acidic environment, such as that found in endosomes. This interaction is necessary for high-affinity ligand binding, as demonstrated by in vitro binding assays and FRET assays, which confirmed the direct interaction between TLR10 and dsRNA (Lee2018Recognition). Upon stimulation with dsRNA, TLR10 recruits the adaptor protein MyD88, but not TRIF, to mediate signaling, indicating a specific pathway for downstream signaling (Lee2018Recognition).

TLR10 also competes with TLR3 for binding to dsRNA, specifically poly(I:C), a known ligand for TLR3. This competition affects the regulation of interferon-beta (IFNβ) expression, with TLR10 having an inhibitory effect on IFNβ production by sequestering dsRNA from TLR3 (Lee2018Recognition). TLR10's interaction with MyD88 and IRF7, but not IRF3, suggests a MyD88-IRF7 axis in TLR10 signaling (Lee2018Recognition).

In the context of HIV-1 infection, TLR10 interacts with HIV-1 proteins, particularly gp41, which acts as a ligand for TLR10. This interaction leads to the activation of NF-κBα and production of IL-8, enhancing HIV-1 infection (Henrick2019TLR10). TLR10 may also form heterodimers with TLR1, further influencing immune responses (Henrick2019TLR10).
