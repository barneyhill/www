# TM9SF2

## Overview
TM9SF2 is a gene that encodes the protein transmembrane 9 superfamily member 2, which is primarily involved in the regulation of glycolipid biosynthesis. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is predominantly localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it plays a critical role in the synthesis of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) by facilitating the proper localization and function of Gb3 synthase (Yamaji2019A). TM9SF2 is also implicated in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion and signaling, through its interactions with other glycosyltransferases and proteins such as NDST1, which is involved in heparan sulfate synthesis (Meisen2020Pooled). The gene's expression and function have been linked to several pathological conditions, including colorectal and pancreatic cancers, as well as viral infections, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease progression (Li2019LINC01232; Clark2018Transposon).

## Function
TM9SF2 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of glycolipid biosynthesis, particularly in the synthesis of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) from lactosylceramide (LacCer). The protein is primarily localized to the Golgi apparatus, where it plays a crucial role in the proper localization and transport of Gb3 synthase, a key enzyme in glycolipid metabolism (Yamaji2019A). TM9SF2 interacts with Gb3 synthase, ensuring its proximity to substrates like LacCer and UDP-galactose, which is essential for efficient Gb3 biosynthesis (Yamaji2019A). The C-terminal region of TM9SF2 is important for its function, as it binds COPI coat proteins, facilitating intra-Golgi and Golgi-ER retrograde transport (Yamaji2019A).

TM9SF2's role extends beyond Gb3 synthase, as it may influence the localization and function of other glycosyltransferases, affecting the overall balance of glycosphingolipids in cells (Yamaji2019A). This regulation is crucial for maintaining cellular processes such as cell adhesion, signaling, and response to toxins (Yamaji2019A). TM9SF2's function in healthy cells involves maintaining the proper localization and function of glycosyltransferases through its interaction with COPI vesicles and its C-terminal region (Yamaji2019A).

## Clinical Significance
TM9SF2 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in cellular processes and its expression levels. In colorectal cancer (CRC), TM9SF2 is identified as a novel oncogene. It is significantly overexpressed in approximately one-third of CRC tumors, and its high expression is associated with advanced cancer stages and decreased disease-free survival. Knockout studies in CRC cell lines have shown that reducing TM9SF2 expression leads to decreased tumor growth and proliferation, suggesting its role in cancer progression (Clark2018Transposon).

In pancreatic adenocarcinoma, TM9SF2 is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis. The long non-coding RNA LINC01232 positively regulates TM9SF2, enhancing its expression and stability, which promotes cancer cell growth and migration. This interaction suggests that TM9SF2 contributes to the oncogenic activities in pancreatic cancer (Li2019LINC01232).

TM9SF2 is also involved in viral infections. It is crucial for the stabilization and localization of NDST1, which is important for heparan sulfate synthesis. This pathway is essential for the attachment and infection of various viruses, including AAV2 and HIV. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in TM9SF2 have been associated with AIDS progression, although the mechanisms remain unclear (Meisen2020Pooled; Luteijn2019A).

## Interactions
TM9SF2 is involved in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. It interacts with NDST1, a key enzyme in heparan sulfate synthesis pathways, which are important for AAV2 attachment and infection. This interaction is significant for the stabilization and localization of NDST1, facilitating the synthesis of heparan sulfate proteoglycans that act as viral receptors (Meisen2020Pooled).

TM9SF2 also interacts with Gb3 synthase, a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of the glycolipid Gb3. This interaction is selective for the high mannose type of Gb3 synthase and is crucial for the regulation of Gb3 synthesis. The C-terminal KxD/E motif of TM9SF2, which interacts with the COPI coatomer, is essential for its function in this process (Yamaji2019A). TM9SF2 affects the localization of Gb3 synthase, influencing its proximity to substrates and impacting Gb3 biosynthesis (Yamaji2019A).

In pancreatic adenocarcinoma, TM9SF2 expression is regulated by LINC01232, a long intergenic non-protein coding RNA. LINC01232 recruits EIF4A3 to enhance the stability of TM9SF2 mRNA, promoting cell proliferation and migration (Li2019LINC01232). These interactions highlight TM9SF2's involvement in both viral processes and cancer progression.
