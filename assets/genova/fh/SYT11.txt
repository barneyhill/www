# SYT11

## Overview
SYT11 is a gene that encodes the protein synaptotagmin 11, a member of the synaptotagmin family, which is primarily involved in neuronal processes. Unlike other synaptotagmins, synaptotagmin 11 does not bind calcium, distinguishing it from its counterparts in the regulation of synaptic vesicle trafficking and neurotransmitter release. The protein is characterized by its transmembrane domain and two conserved cytoplasmic domains, C2A and C2B, which facilitate interactions with other proteins, such as Endophilin A1 and vti1a, influencing synaptic vesicle endocytosis and neurotransmission regulation (Wang2023Synaptotagmin11; Shimojo2019Synaptotagmin11). Synaptotagmin 11 also plays a role in mechanoprotection in astrocytes and is implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases such as Parkinson's disease and gastric cancer, where its expression and interactions affect cellular pathways and disease progression (Yan2019Synaptotagmin‐11; Kim2022Synaptotagmin).

## Structure
Synaptotagmin-11 (SYT11) is a member of the synaptotagmin family, characterized by its unique structural features. Unlike other synaptotagmins, SYT11 does not bind calcium, phospholipids, or SNARE proteins, which is attributed to its inactive calcium-binding sites (Shimojo2019Synaptotagmin11). The protein is composed of a short luminal N-terminus, a transmembrane domain, and a linker region followed by two conserved cytoplasmic domains, C2A and C2B (Wang2023Synaptotagmin11). The C2A domain has an aspartate-to-serine substitution affecting calcium binding, while the C2B domain is crucial for interactions with other proteins, such as Endophilin A1 (EndoA1) and cavin1 (Wang2023Synaptotagmin11; Yan2019Synaptotagmin‐11).

The secondary structure of the C2B domain includes eight beta-sheets and one alpha-helix, which are essential for its high-affinity binding to EndoA1 (Wang2023Synaptotagmin11). SYT11's interaction with EndoA1 is Ca2+-independent and involves the N-terminal BAR domain of EndoA1 (Wang2023Synaptotagmin11). The C2A domain also plays a significant role in binding to vti1a, a non-canonical SNARE protein, which is critical for inhibiting spontaneous neurotransmission (Li2021Synaptotagmin‐11). These structural features and interactions highlight SYT11's role in synaptic vesicle endocytosis and neurotransmission regulation.

## Function
Synaptotagmin-11 (SYT11) is a protein involved in various cellular processes, primarily in neurons. Unlike other synaptotagmins, SYT11 does not bind calcium but plays a crucial role in synaptic vesicle trafficking and neurotransmitter release. It is involved in a unique vesicular transport pathway essential for normal development, synaptic function, and memory formation (Shimojo2019Synaptotagmin11). SYT11 is localized on vesicles that resemble trafficking endosomes and is not associated with synaptic vesicles, indicating its distinct role in vesicle trafficking (Shimojo2019Synaptotagmin11).

SYT11 regulates synaptic vesicle endocytosis by interacting with Endophilin A1 (EndoA1), inhibiting the endocytic process and ensuring precise protein retrieval during synaptic vesicle recycling (Wang2023Synaptotagmin11). It also modulates spontaneous neurotransmitter release through its interaction with vti1a, a non-canonical SNARE protein, without affecting evoked neurotransmission (Li2021Synaptotagmin‐11).

In astrocytes, SYT11 is involved in regulating caveolae functions, responding to mechanical stimuli, and maintaining membrane integrity. It interacts with caveolar proteins like cavin1 and EHD2, playing a role in mechanoprotection by regulating caveolae dynamics (Yan2019Synaptotagmin‐11).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the SYT11 gene have been implicated in several diseases, most notably Parkinson's disease (PD) and gastric cancer. In Parkinson's disease, SYT11 is associated with neurodegeneration through its role in the autophagy-lysosome pathway. Mutations in SYT11 can lead to lysosomal dysfunction and impaired autophagic clearance, contributing to the accumulation of proteins like α-synuclein, which is critical in PD pathogenesis (Bento2016The). SYT11 is also a substrate for the E3 ubiquitin ligase parkin, and its accumulation due to parkin dysfunction is linked to neurotoxicity in PD (Wang2018Synaptotagmin11). Rare variants in SYT11 have been identified as significantly associated with an increased risk of PD, independent of other known genetic factors (Rudakou2020Targeted).

In gastric cancer, SYT11 is involved in promoting oncogenesis, particularly in the diffuse-type, which is associated with poor prognosis. SYT11 acts as a scaffold protein in the MKK7-JNK signaling pathway, facilitating processes like epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which are crucial for cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (Kim2022Synaptotagmin). High expression levels of SYT11 correlate with worse survival outcomes in gastric cancer patients, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Kim2022Synaptotagmin).

## Interactions
Synaptotagmin-11 (SYT11) is involved in several protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. SYT11 interacts with vti1a, a non-canonical SNARE protein, to inhibit spontaneous neurotransmitter release. This interaction is specific, as SYT11 does not bind to other SNARE proteins like syb2 and syntaxin1. The C2A domain of SYT11 is crucial for binding to vti1a, and this interaction modulates spontaneous neurotransmission by inhibiting vti1a-containing vesicles (Li2021Synaptotagmin‐11).

SYT11 also interacts with parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and is identified as a physiological substrate of parkin. This interaction is significant in the context of Parkinson's disease, as parkin ubiquitinates SYT11, targeting it for proteasome-dependent degradation. Impaired ubiquitination due to parkin mutations leads to SYT11 accumulation, contributing to neurotoxicity and motor abnormalities (Wang2018Synaptotagmin11).

In astrocytes, SYT11 interacts with cavin1 and EHD2, forming a complex that stabilizes caveolar structures and regulates caveolae-mediated endocytosis. The C2B domain of SYT11 is necessary for binding with cavin1, while both C2A and C2B domains are involved in the interaction with EHD2 (Yan2019Synaptotagmin‐11). These interactions highlight SYT11's role in mechanosensation and mechanoprotection in astrocytes.
