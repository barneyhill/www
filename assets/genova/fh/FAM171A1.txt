# FAM171A1

## Overview
FAM171A1 is a gene that encodes the protein Astroprincin (APCN), a type 1 transmembrane glycoprotein involved in various cellular processes. APCN is part of the UPF0560 family and is expressed in the central nervous system and multiple tissues, including the placenta, skeletal and heart muscle, kidney, and pancreas (Wahab2020Impact; Kaprio2021Elevated). The protein plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular structure and motility, as evidenced by its influence on actin stress fibers and cellular projections (Kaprio2021Elevated). FAM171A1 has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer, where its overexpression is associated with increased tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis (Sanawar2019Estrogen). Additionally, FAM171A1 is considered a potential prognostic biomarker in colon cancer and oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma, highlighting its clinical significance (Wahab2020Impact; Kaprio2021Elevated).

## Function
The FAM171A1 gene encodes a protein known as Astroprincin (APCN), which is a type 1 transmembrane glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 98 kDa and composed of 890 amino acids. This protein is physiologically expressed in the central nervous system and various tissues, including placental trophoblasts, skeletal and heart muscle, kidney, and pancreas (Wahab2020Impact; Kaprio2021Elevated). APCN is part of the UPF0560 family, which includes two other members, FAM171a2 and FAM171b, sharing 39% and 32% identity, respectively, with APCN (Kaprio2021Elevated).

In healthy human cells, APCN is involved in cell motility and structural integrity. Overexpression of APCN in various cell lines induces the sprouting of slender projections, while knockdown of APCN expression by siRNA leads to the disappearance of actin stress fibers, suggesting its role in maintaining cellular structure (Kaprio2021Elevated). The protein's structure includes an intracytoplasmic domain and an extracellular domain with two N-glycosidic side chains, indicating its involvement in cellular communication and signaling pathways (Kaprio2021Elevated). These molecular activities contribute to the normal functioning of cells and tissues where APCN is expressed.

## Clinical Significance
FAM171A1, also known as astroprincin (APCN), has been implicated in several cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), FAM171A1 is overexpressed compared to non-TNBC types, correlating with poor survival rates and increased cancer cell aggressiveness. This overexpression is linked to the loss of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and its regulatory microRNA, miR590-5p, which normally suppresses FAM171A1 expression. The absence of this regulatory axis in TNBC leads to increased FAM171A1 levels, contributing to the invasiveness and stemness of cancer cells (Sanawar2019Estrogen).

In colon cancer, high expression of FAM171A1 is associated with poor prognosis, serving as an independent marker of poor outcomes regardless of cancer stage, grade, age, or gender. This suggests its potential as a prognostic biomarker for identifying patients who may require more intensive treatment (Kaprio2021Elevated).

FAM171A1 is also overexpressed in oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC), where it is linked to larger tumor size and recurrence, although it does not significantly impact overall survival outcomes (Wahab2020Impact). These findings highlight the clinical significance of FAM171A1 in various cancers, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
FAM171A1, also known as Astroprincin, is a glycoprotein that has been identified to interact with several proteins, suggesting its involvement in various cellular processes. In the context of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), FAM171A1 interacts with proteins such as FAM171B, PCDHGB1, TNFRSF17, TMEM, CTDSPL, and NTRK1. Many of these proteins are implicated in cancer, indicating that FAM171A1 may play a role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression (Sanawar2019Estrogen).

The interactions of FAM171A1 are associated with cancer cell aggressiveness and chemoresistance, as its expression affects the ability of TNBC cells to form mammospheres, a property linked to cancer stemness and invasiveness (Sanawar2019Estrogen). The study also suggests that FAM171A1 may be involved in the TGFβ/Smad and Wnt/β-catenin pathways, which are crucial for stem cell functions and cancer progression (Sanawar2019Estrogen).

In a Parkinson's disease model, FAM171A1 was noted in genome-wide association studies, but it did not show known protein-protein interactions in the STRING network analysis, indicating a potential role that does not involve direct physical interactions within the pathways analyzed (Höllerhage2022Transcriptome).
