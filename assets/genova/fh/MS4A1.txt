# MS4A1

## Overview
The MS4A1 gene encodes the CD20 protein, a transmembrane protein primarily expressed on the surface of B lymphocytes. CD20 is a member of the membrane-spanning 4A gene family and is characterized by its four transmembrane domains, which contribute to its role as a calcium ion channel or regulatory component in B cell activation and signaling (Bubien1993Transfection; Eon2015The). The protein is crucial for B cell development, differentiation, and immune response, functioning as a co-stimulatory molecule in conjunction with the B cell receptor (BCR) (Polyak2008CD20). CD20's involvement in calcium ion conductance is essential for BCR signaling, influencing B cell proliferation and activation (Bubien1993Transfection). Clinically, CD20 is a target for therapeutic antibodies such as rituximab, used in the treatment of B-cell malignancies, although mutations in MS4A1 can lead to treatment resistance (Rushton2020Genetic). The gene's expression and function are significant in both normal immune processes and pathological conditions, making it a critical focus in immunology and oncology research.

## Structure
The MS4A1 protein, also known as CD20, is characterized by its structure comprising four hydrophobic transmembrane domains, which are connected by one intracellular loop and two extracellular loops. Both the N- and C-termini of the protein are located within the cytosol (Eon2015The). The transmembrane regions lack polar residues, which distinguishes them from tetraspanins, and the cytoplasmic termini are relatively long, ranging from 20 to 90 amino acids (Eon2015The). The protein forms homo-oligomers, typically tetramers, which resemble the structure of the ion channel Orai1, suggesting a role in ion conductance, particularly calcium (Liang2001Structural; Eon2015The).

The extracellular loops of MS4A1 are significant for antibody binding, with the larger second loop presenting epitopes for therapeutic antibodies like rituximab and ofatumumab (Eon2015The). The protein is involved in calcium regulation, potentially functioning as a component of a calcium-permeable cation channel (Liang2001Structural). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may occur, influencing its function, although specific sites are not detailed in the context provided (Adra1994Cloning). The MS4A1 gene is part of a larger family of proteins with similar structural features, all located on chromosome 11q12 (Liang2001Structural).

## Function
The MS4A1 gene encodes the CD20 protein, which is predominantly expressed on the surface of B lymphocytes. CD20 is a tetraspanning membrane protein that plays a critical role in B cell development, differentiation, and activation. It is involved in the regulation of calcium ion conductance across the plasma membrane, which is essential for B cell receptor (BCR) signaling and subsequent cellular responses (Bubien1993Transfection; Polyak2008CD20). 

CD20 functions as a calcium ion channel or a regulatory component of such channels, facilitating calcium influx that is crucial for B cell activation and proliferation (Bubien1993Transfection; Mattiola2021The). The protein forms homo-oligomeric complexes in the plasma membrane, which are associated with the BCR, and upon BCR activation, these complexes dissociate, allowing CD20 to participate in downstream signaling pathways (Polyak2008CD20).

CD20's role in calcium signaling is modulated by phosphorylation, which can alter its conductance properties and influence B cell cycle progression (Bubien1993Transfection). This regulation of calcium homeostasis is vital for maintaining optimal humoral immunity and effective immune responses (Zuccolo2013Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MS4A1 gene, which encodes the CD20 protein, have significant clinical implications, particularly in B-cell malignancies. In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), mutations in MS4A1 are associated with resistance to rituximab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CD20. These mutations often lead to decreased CD20 expression, reducing the efficacy of rituximab and contributing to treatment resistance (Rushton2020Genetic; Tomita2016Genetic). 

Rituximab resistance is also linked to metabolic reprogramming mediated by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), which downregulates MS4A1/CD20 expression in rituximab-resistant DLBCL cells (Jiang2021Pyruvate). In relapsed/refractory DLBCL, MS4A1 mutations exhibit clonal expansion following rituximab therapy, suggesting a role in acquired resistance (Rushton2020Genetic). 

In melanoma, low MS4A1/CD20 expression, particularly when concurrent with a KIT mutation, is associated with poor prognosis, indicating the importance of CD20 in the immune response to tumors (Cingam2020525). These findings underscore the critical role of MS4A1 in the pathogenesis and treatment resistance of various cancers.

## Interactions
MS4A1, also known as CD20, is involved in several interactions with other proteins, particularly within the immune system. It is known to form homo- and heterocomplexes and is often located in lipid rafts, where it plays a role in regulating cell activation and signaling of other immunoreceptors such as the B cell receptor (BCR) (Mattiola2021The). CD20 is associated with tyrosine kinases of the Src family, including Lyn, Fyn, and Lck, which are involved in intracellular signaling and B cell proliferation, suggesting its role as a BCR co-stimulatory molecule (Mattiola2021The).

Flow cytometric energy transfer (FCET) analysis has shown that MS4A1 is in close proximity to tetraspanins CD53, CD81, and CD82, indicating potential interactions within a supramolecular structure that includes MHC II molecules (Mattiola2021The). MS4A1 also colocalizes with BCRs in lipid rafts of human B cell lines, indicating a physical interaction that may modulate immunoreceptor activity (Mattiola2021The). These interactions highlight the role of MS4A1 in immune cell function and its potential as a therapeutic target. However, further investigation is needed to confirm these interactions, as other analyses have shown that MS4A4A, another MS4A protein, does not interact with certain tetraspanins like CD9 and CD63 (Mattiola2021The).
