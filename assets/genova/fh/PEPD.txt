# PEPD

## Overview
The PEPD gene encodes the enzyme prolidase, a metalloprotease that plays a critical role in protein metabolism by catalyzing the hydrolysis of dipeptides containing proline or hydroxyproline. This enzymatic activity is essential for collagen turnover and connective tissue maintenance, impacting processes such as cell growth and tissue repair (Wilk2017Substrate; Lupi2008Human). Prolidase is a homodimeric protein that requires Mn2+ ions for its catalytic function and is involved in the final step of protein catabolism (Lupi2008Human). Beyond its enzymatic role, the PEPD gene product interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, modulating its activity and influencing cellular homeostasis and apoptosis (Yang2017PEPD). Mutations in the PEPD gene can lead to prolidase deficiency, a rare genetic disorder with diverse clinical manifestations, including skin ulcers and immune dysfunction (Spodenkiewicz2020Clinical; Rossignol2021Quantitative).

## Structure
The PEPD gene encodes the enzyme prolidase, which is a homodimer with each subunit composed of 492 amino acids and a molecular weight of approximately 54,305 Da (Lupi2008Human; Tanoue1991Molecular). The enzyme's primary structure includes a sequence of amino acids that form the polypeptide chain, while its secondary structure is predicted to contain alpha-helices and beta-sheets (Lupi2004Characterization). Prolidase's tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding necessary for its enzymatic function, although detailed crystallographic data for the human enzyme are not available (Lupi2004Characterization).

The enzyme's quaternary structure is characterized by its dimeric nature, with two identical subunits forming the active enzyme (Lupi2008Human). Prolidase contains metal-binding sites that interact with Mn2+ ions, which are essential for its catalytic activity (Lupi2008Human). The enzyme undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, which regulate its activity (Lupi2008Human). The structure of prolidase shares similarities with the 'pita-bread' fold found in E. coli methionine aminopeptidase, featuring two bivalent metal ion binding regions within the active site (Lupi2004Characterization).

## Function
The PEPD gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating the tumor suppressor protein p53 in healthy human cells. PEPD binds to p53, particularly in the nucleus, inhibiting its phosphorylation and activation, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing unwarranted apoptosis (Yang2017PEPD). This interaction sequesters more than 50% of cellular p53, modulating its activity without requiring enzymatic function (Yang2017PEPD). PEPD competes with MDM2 for binding to p53, preventing its mitochondrial translocation and subsequent activation of apoptosis pathways (Yang2017PEPD).

In addition to its role in p53 regulation, PEPD encodes the enzyme prolidase, which is involved in the final step of protein catabolism, specifically the breakdown of dipeptides containing proline or hydroxyproline. This process is crucial for collagen synthesis and overall connective tissue maintenance (Wilk2017Substrate; Lupi2008Human). Prolidase activity is dependent on Mn2+ ions and is essential for recycling proline, impacting cell growth and tissue repair (Lupi2008Human). The enzyme is active in the cytoplasm and plays a role in matrix remodeling and protein metabolism (Wilk2017Substrate).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PEPD gene, which encodes the enzyme prolidase, lead to prolidase deficiency (PD), a rare autosomal recessive disorder. This condition is characterized by a wide range of clinical manifestations, including chronic skin ulcers, recurrent infections, intellectual disability, and facial dysmorphism. The deficiency results in the accumulation of imidodipeptides in the urine due to impaired collagen metabolism, as prolidase is crucial for the breakdown of proline-containing dipeptides (Spodenkiewicz2020Clinical; Rossignol2021Quantitative).

The incidence of PD is estimated to be 1-2 cases per million births, with a higher prevalence in certain populations, such as the Druze and Amish communities (Lupi2008Human; Wang2006A). The condition exhibits variable expressivity, and there is no clear correlation between genotype and phenotype (Spodenkiewicz2020Clinical). 

Alterations in PEPD expression can also impact collagen metabolism and immune response, leading to conditions such as coronary artery ectasia (CAE) and immune dysregulation. Specific PEPD gene variants have been associated with altered serum prolidase levels and clinical conditions like hypertension and diabetes mellitus (PekkocUyanik2022Nextgeneration; Suri2016A).

## Interactions
PEPD (peptidase D) interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, binding to its proline-rich domain (PRD) via PEPD's C-terminal sequence. This interaction occurs in both the nucleus and cytosol, sequestering a significant portion of p53 and inhibiting its phosphorylation and activation. PEPD competes with MDM2 for binding to p53, thereby preventing MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of p53, as well as its translocation to the mitochondria (Yang2017PEPD).

Disruption of the PEPD-p53 interaction, such as through PEPD knockdown, leads to posttranslational modifications of p53, including acetylation, mono-ubiquitination, and phosphorylation. These modifications result in the refolding and reactivation of p53 mutants, restoring their tumor suppressor functions (Yang2021Loss). PEPD also interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), directly binding and activating it, which stimulates downstream signaling pathways (Yang2013Prolidase).

In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a variant of PepD interacts with numerous proteins, including the 35-kDa antigen Rv2744c, suggesting a role in stress response and virulence (White2011The).
