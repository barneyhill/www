# SPEG

## Overview
The SPEG gene encodes the striated muscle enriched protein kinase, a member of the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) family, which plays a pivotal role in muscle physiology. This protein kinase is predominantly expressed in striated muscles and is integral to the excitation-contraction coupling process, essential for muscle contraction and relaxation. SPEG is characterized by its two serine/threonine kinase domains, which are involved in various cellular signaling pathways, and is known for its interactions with key proteins that maintain muscle structure and function (Fleming2021Exploring; Luo2021Striated). The protein's activity is regulated through post-translational modifications, which are crucial for cardiac function and calcium handling (Fleming2021Exploring). Mutations in the SPEG gene have been linked to muscle-related diseases such as centronuclear myopathy and dilated cardiomyopathy, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining normal muscle physiology (Agrawal2014SPEG; Luo2021Striated).

## Structure
The SPEG (striated muscle enriched protein kinase) gene encodes a protein that is a member of the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) family, characterized by its structural domains and kinase activity. SPEG contains two tandemly arranged serine/threonine kinase domains, SK1 and SK2, which are a hallmark of the MLCK family and are involved in cellular signaling pathways (Fleming2021Exploring; Luo2021Striated). These kinase domains are flanked by immunoglobulin (Ig) and fibronectin type III (FnIII) domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and are crucial for the protein's function in muscle tissues (Luo2020SPEG; Luo2021Striated).

SPEG undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in four major isoforms: Spegα, Spegβ, Apeg1, and Bpeg. Spegα and Spegβ are the largest isoforms and are predominantly expressed in striated muscles, while Apeg1 and Bpeg are found in vascular tissues and the brain, respectively (Agrawal2014SPEG; Luo2021Striated). These isoforms differ at the N-terminus due to different transcriptional initiation sites (Lee2023Speg).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by protein kinase B (PKB) and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), regulate SPEG's activity. These modifications are important for cardiac function and calcium handling, influencing the phosphorylation status of proteins like SERCA2 (Fleming2021Exploring).

## Function
The SPEG gene encodes the striated muscle preferentially expressed protein kinase, which plays a crucial role in muscle development, function, and disease. In healthy human cells, SPEG is involved in the excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling process, essential for muscle contraction. This process involves the conversion of electrical stimuli into mechanical action, facilitated by structures called triads in skeletal muscle and dyads in cardiac muscle (Lee2023Speg; Luo2021Striated). SPEG is important for maintaining the structural integrity and function of these complexes by interacting with proteins such as RyR2, Serca2a, and Jph2 in the heart, and RyR1, Ca V 1.1α1, and Jph2 in skeletal muscle (Lee2023Speg).

SPEG is also involved in the phosphorylation of proteins critical for muscle function, such as junctophilin-2 (JPH2) and SERCA2a, which are important for calcium homeostasis and contractility in cardiac muscle (Kusumoto2019SPEG; Luo2021Striated). The phosphorylation of SERCA2a by SPEG enhances calcium reuptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which is crucial for the contraction and relaxation cycle of cardiac muscle (Quan2019SPEG). SPEG's activity is vital for maintaining normal muscle physiology and function, preventing Ca2+ leaks, and ensuring proper muscle contraction (Lee2023Speg).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SPEG gene are associated with centronuclear myopathy (CNM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), conditions characterized by muscle weakness and cardiac dysfunction. CNM is a subtype of congenital myopathy marked by hypotonia and muscle dysfunction, with symptoms ranging from mild motor delays to severe respiratory weakness. Cellular features include increased central nucleation of myofibers and disruptions in excitation-contraction coupling (Agrawal2014SPEG; Luo2021Striated). 

Mutations affecting both SPEG isoforms, SPEGα and SPEGβ, are linked to more severe phenotypes, including cardiac dysfunction and early death, while mutations affecting only SPEGβ are associated with milder phenotypes without cardiac involvement (Luo2021Striated). SPEG interacts with the MTM1 protein, and this interaction is crucial for maintaining calcium homeostasis in muscle tissues. Disruptions in this interaction can lead to abnormal muscle cell development and function (Zhang2021Clinical).

SPEG deficiency can also lead to non-compaction cardiomyopathy and neuropathy, as seen in a case involving a homozygous stop mutation resulting in a C-terminal truncation of the SPEG protein (Wang2018A). The gene's role in excitation-contraction coupling and cytoskeletal organization is critical, and its deficiency can lead to severe cardiac conditions (Agrawal2014SPEG; Liu2009Disruption).

## Interactions
SPEG (striated muscle enriched protein kinase) is involved in various protein interactions critical for muscle function. It binds with desmin, a type III intermediate filament protein, through its Ig-like-9 and fibronectin III-2 domains. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of muscle fibers, as SPEG deficiency leads to desmin aggregates and defects in muscle structure (Luo2020SPEG). SPEG also interacts with proteins involved in excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) complexes, such as RyR1, RyR2, and Jph2, which are essential for calcium handling in muscle cells. These interactions help stabilize ECC protein complexes in both skeletal and cardiac muscles (Lee2023Speg).

SPEG is part of the myosin light chain kinase family and interacts with MTM1, a phosphatase involved in X-linked myotubular myopathy, suggesting a shared regulatory mechanism in muscle diseases (Luo2021Striated). Additionally, SPEG's second kinase domain (SK2) phosphorylates SERCA2a, a calcium pump, enhancing its oligomerization and calcium reuptake activity, which is crucial for muscle relaxation (Quan2019SPEG). These interactions underscore SPEG's role in maintaining muscle structure and function through its involvement in protein complexes and signaling pathways.
