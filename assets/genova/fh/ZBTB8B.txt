# ZBTB8B

## Overview
ZBTB8B is a gene that encodes the zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 8B, which is part of the zinc finger protein family. This protein is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs and a BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain, which are typically involved in DNA binding and protein-protein interactions, respectively. ZBTB8B plays a crucial role in chromatin modification and gene silencing, particularly during the differentiation of embryonic stem cells. It interacts with various other zinc finger proteins and is regulated in coordination with pluripotency factors, suggesting its involvement in transcriptional regulation and cellular differentiation processes (Kwak2018Zinc).

## Interactions
ZBTB8B, a zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein, is known to interact with C-terminal binding protein 2 (Ctbp2) in mouse embryonic stem cells. This interaction is part of a broader network involving various zinc finger proteins, including Zfp217, Zfp516, Zfp518b, Hic2, Wiz, Zscan4f, and Zscan10. These interactions were confirmed through immunoprecipitation experiments, highlighting the role of ZBTB8B in chromatin modification and gene silencing during embryonic stem cell differentiation (Kwak2018Zinc).

The expression of ZBTB8B, along with other zinc finger proteins, is regulated during embryonic stem cell differentiation. The study found that the expression of ZBTB8B decreases in a manner similar to Ctbp2, suggesting a coordinated role in the exit from pluripotency. The regulation of these proteins is influenced by Oct4, a key pluripotency factor, where depletion of Oct4 leads to decreased levels of Zfp217, Zfp518b, and Zscan10, indicating a potential regulatory network involving ZBTB8B (Kwak2018Zinc).

These interactions suggest that ZBTB8B may play a significant role in transcriptional regulation and the formation of protein complexes, contributing to the modulation of gene expression during cellular differentiation processes.
