# KLHL2

## Overview
KLHL2 is a gene that encodes the protein kelch-like family member 2, also known as Mayven, which is part of the Kelch-like protein family. This protein is characterized by its structural domains, including a BTB/POZ domain, a BACK domain, and multiple Kelch motifs, which together facilitate its role as a substrate adaptor in the Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (Dhanoa2013Update; Shi2019Kelchlike). KLHL2 is predominantly expressed in the brain, where it plays a crucial role in organizing the actin cytoskeleton and promoting neurite outgrowth, as well as in oligodendrocyte differentiation through interactions with the FYN tyrosine kinase (Dhanoa2013Update). Additionally, KLHL2 is involved in the regulation of renal ion transport processes by targeting specific kinases for degradation, although its effect is less pronounced compared to other family members (Shi2019Kelchlike). The protein's interactions and functions highlight its importance in cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in neurodegenerative processes and blood pressure regulation.

## Structure
KLHL2, also known as Mayven, is a protein encoded by the KLHL2 gene in humans. It is a member of the Kelch-like protein family, characterized by the presence of a BTB/POZ domain, a BACK domain, and multiple Kelch motifs. The BTB/POZ domain is involved in protein binding and dimerization, while the Kelch motifs form a β-propeller structure that facilitates substrate recruitment (Dhanoa2013Update; Shi2019Kelchlike). The BACK domain acts as a linker between the BTB and Kelch domains (Shi2019Kelchlike).

The Kelch domain of KLHL2 is composed of six Kelch repeats, each forming a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, contributing to the β-propeller tertiary structure (Schumacher2014Structural). This structure is crucial for its role as a substrate adaptor in the Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, where it interacts with Cullin3 to mediate ubiquitination processes (Shi2019Kelchlike; Schumacher2014Structural).

KLHL2 is primarily expressed in the brain and plays a significant role in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, binding directly to F-actin through its Kelch repeats (Dhanoa2013Update). It is also involved in oligodendrocyte differentiation and interacts with the FYN tyrosine kinase, suggesting a role in promoting neurite outgrowth and axonal-glial contact (Dhanoa2013Update).

## Function
KLHL2, also known as Mayven, is a protein that plays a significant role in cellular processes through its involvement in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. It functions as a substrate adaptor for the Cul3 ubiquitin ligase complex, facilitating the ubiquitination and degradation of specific target proteins, such as neuronal pentraxin with chromo domain (NPCD) and uridine-cytidine kinase 1 (UCK1) (Shi2019Kelchlike; Zhang2020Deubiquitinase). This activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating protein turnover in cells.

KLHL2 is predominantly expressed in the brain and is involved in organizing the actin cytoskeleton by binding directly to F-actin through its Kelch repeats. This interaction is essential for promoting neurite outgrowth and process extension during oligodendrocyte differentiation (Dhanoa2013Update). KLHL2 also interacts with the FYN tyrosine kinase, which suggests a role in strengthening axonal-glial contact and promoting oligodendrocyte process outgrowth (Dhanoa2013Update).

In the kidney, KLHL2 is involved in the regulation of renal ion transport processes by targeting with-no-lysine kinase 4 (WNK4) for degradation, although its regulatory effect is less pronounced compared to KLHL3 (Shi2019Kelchlike).

## Clinical Significance
KLHL2, also known as Mayven, is primarily expressed in the brain and plays a role in neuronal protein aggregation, which is linked to apoptotic death and neurodegeneration. It functions as a substrate adaptor of the Cul3 ubiquitin ligase, targeting neuronal pentraxin with chromo domain (NPCD) for ubiquitination, increasing the formation of NPCD aggresomes (Shi2019Kelchlike). Although no specific diseases have been directly linked to KLHL2 mutations, its interaction with WNK kinases suggests a role in blood pressure regulation. KLHL2 binds to WNK4, a kinase involved in renal ion transport processes, and targets it for degradation. This interaction affects the phosphorylation of OSR1/SPAK and the NaCl cotransporter (NCC), primarily in the kidney medulla (Shi2019Kelchlike; Schumacher2014Structural). While KLHL3 mutations are associated with Gordon's syndrome, a hereditary form of hypertension, no mutations in KLHL2 have been reported in this condition. However, KLHL2's role in regulating WNK isoforms indicates its potential involvement in blood pressure regulation (Schumacher2014Structural). Further research is needed to fully understand the clinical significance of KLHL2 in disease contexts.

## Interactions
KLHL2, also known as Mayven, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with uridine-cytidine kinase 1 (UCK1) in the cytoplasm, where it binds to the middle fragments and C terminus of UCK1. This interaction leads to K48-linked ubiquitination of UCK1 at the K81 site, promoting its degradation via the proteasome pathway (Zhang2020Deubiquitinase). KLHL2 also forms complexes with UCK1 and facilitates the interaction between UCK1 and the deubiquitinase USP28, although USP28 does not directly bind to UCK1. This interaction is modulated by ATM-mediated phosphorylation, which affects the stability of UCK1 (Zhang2020Deubiquitinase).

KLHL2 functions as a substrate adaptor for the Cul3 ubiquitin ligase complex, targeting proteins such as neuronal pentraxin with chromo domain (NPCD) for ubiquitination. This interaction is linked to apoptotic death and neurodegeneration in neurons (Shi2019Kelchlike). KLHL2 also interacts with WNK kinases, particularly WNK4, through its Kelch domain, playing a role in blood pressure regulation by mediating the ubiquitination of WNK4 (Schumacher2014Structural). These interactions highlight KLHL2's role in various cellular pathways, including ubiquitination and protein stability regulation.
