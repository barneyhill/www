# C19orf67

## Overview
C19orf67 is a gene located on chromosome 19 in humans, encoding the protein known as chromosome 19 open reading frame 67. This protein is categorized as an uncharacterized protein, meaning its specific biological functions and roles within cellular processes are not yet fully understood. Despite the limited information on its precise function, studies suggest that proteins encoded by open reading frames like C19orf67 may play roles in various cellular pathways and processes, potentially influencing gene expression and cellular homeostasis. Further research is necessary to elucidate the specific interactions and clinical significance of the C19orf67 protein, as well as its potential implications in human health and disease.
