# STK24

## Overview
STK24, or serine/threonine kinase 24, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the STE20 family of kinases, which are pivotal in various cellular signaling pathways. The protein product of STK24, also known as mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 3 (MST3), is characterized by an N-terminal kinase domain responsible for its enzymatic activity and a C-terminal regulatory domain that facilitates interactions with other proteins (Qiu2023Molecular). As a serine/threonine kinase, MST3 plays a significant role in modulating cellular processes such as signal transduction, apoptosis, and cytoskeletal organization. It is particularly important in the brain, where it contributes to the development and maintenance of dendritic spines and excitatory synapses (Yang2020STK24). Additionally, MST3 is involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses and has been implicated in cancer metastasis inhibition, highlighting its diverse functional roles in health and disease (Jiang2018Protein; Chen2021Serinethreonineprotein).

## Structure
The STK24 protein, also known as serine/threonine kinase 24, is a member of the STE20 family of kinases. It features an N-terminal kinase domain (KD) and a C-terminal regulatory domain. The kinase domain is located between amino acids 36-286, while the regulatory domain spans amino acids 287-443 (Qiu2023Molecular). The N-terminal kinase domain is responsible for its enzymatic activity, facilitating the phosphorylation of substrate proteins by transferring phosphate groups from GTP or ATP to serine or threonine residues (Qiu2023Molecular).

STK24 interacts with other proteins through its C-terminal domain, which is crucial for its role in signaling pathways. This domain interacts with the N-terminal domain of TAK1 and the helix-loop-helix (HLH) domain of IKKβ, playing a role in the IL-17-induced signaling pathway (Jiang2018Protein). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including inflammation and myogenic differentiation, and may act as an adaptor protein in certain signaling pathways (Jiang2018Protein; Wang2024Stk24).

STK24 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which regulate its activity. It can also exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, potentially affecting its function and localization (Qiu2023Molecular).

## Function
Serine/threonine kinase 24 (STK24), also known as mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 3 (MST3), is a member of the STE20 kinase family involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, apoptosis, and cytoskeletal organization. In healthy human cells, STK24 plays a crucial role in modulating excitatory synaptic transmission, particularly in the brain, where it is expressed in neurons and contributes to the development and maintenance of dendritic spines and excitatory synapses (Yang2020STK24).

STK24 is also involved in the regulation of interleukin 17 (IL-17)-induced inflammation. It interacts with components of the IKK complex, such as TAK1 and IKKβ, promoting the activation of the NF-κB pathway, which is essential for the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (Jiang2018Protein). This regulatory function highlights its role in immune responses and inflammation.

In the context of cancer, STK24 has been identified as an inhibitor of metastasis in gastric cancer, where its expression is associated with reduced cell migration and metastasis. It is involved in maintaining cellular adhesion and inhibiting metastatic behavior, suggesting a protective role against cancer progression (Chen2021Serinethreonineprotein).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the STK24 gene, also known as MST3, have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In non-small-cell lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), increased expression of STK24 is associated with poor overall survival and recurrence-free survival, making it an independent prognostic indicator of poor outcomes. This overexpression is often due to DNA amplification and is linked to chemoresistance, suggesting a role in malignant phenotypes (Huang2018STK24).

In the context of cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM), STK24, along with STK25, plays a critical role in endothelial cells. The loss of STK24/25 leads to impaired angiogenesis and vascular disorganization, contributing to CCM lesion formation. This is due to the dysregulation of MEKK3-KLF2/4 signaling pathways, which are crucial for maintaining vascular stability (Yang2023Release).

STK24 is also implicated in metabolic disorders. In the context of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, STK24 is involved in insulin resistance. Its deficiency in mice reduces hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target for managing impaired fasting blood glucose levels (Iglesias2017The).

## Interactions
STK24, also known as MST3, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It interacts with the DEAD box RNA helicase Ddx5/p68, enhancing the interaction between Ddx5 and MyoD, a myogenic regulatory factor, and increasing their recruitment to the MyoG promoter. This interaction is crucial for myogenic differentiation, as STK24 can phosphorylate Ddx5, facilitating its role in muscle cell differentiation (Wang2024Stk24).

In the context of inflammation, STK24 interacts with components of the IKK complex, specifically IKKβ, and TAK1, promoting the formation of TAK1/IKK complexes. This interaction enhances the activation of the IKKβ/NF-κB pathway, which is essential for IL-17-induced inflammation. STK24 acts as an adaptor, facilitating the association of TAK1 with the IKK complex, thereby promoting inflammation (Jiang2018Protein).

STK24 is also associated with the STRIPAK complex in fungi, where it interacts with the striatin homolog PRO11. This interaction is part of the STRIPAK complex's role in cellular processes such as polarization and growth (Frey2015Germinal).
