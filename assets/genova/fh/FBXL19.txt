# FBXL19

## Overview
FBXL19 is a gene that encodes the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 19, a nuclear protein involved in various cellular processes, including gene regulation and protein degradation. The protein is characterized by its F-box domain, which facilitates interactions within the Skp1-Cul1-F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, and leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) that contribute to protein-protein interactions. Additionally, FBXL19 contains a ZF-CxxC domain, enabling it to bind non-methylated CpG islands, a critical function for its role in chromatin association and gene regulation (Dimitrova2018FBXL19). FBXL19 is particularly significant in embryonic stem cells, where it recruits the CDK-Mediator complex to developmental gene promoters, facilitating their activation during differentiation (Dimitrova2018FBXL19). The protein's involvement in ubiquitination pathways also implicates it in the regulation of proteins such as Rac1 and Rac3, influencing cell migration and other cellular functions (Dong2014Fbox; Zhao2013SCF). Alterations in FBXL19 and its associated non-coding RNA, FBXL19-AS1, have been linked to various diseases, including cancer and metabolic disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Acharya2019miR26; Assarsson2024Significant).

## Structure
FBXL19 is a protein characterized by the presence of an F-box domain and leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), which are typical features of proteins involved in protein-protein interactions. The F-box domain is crucial for its interaction with other proteins, particularly within the Skp1-Cul1-F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, although FBXL19 does not function as a substrate selector for the SCF complex in the context of CDK-Mediator interactions (Dimitrova2018FBXL19). The LRRs contribute to the protein's tertiary structure by facilitating stable protein binding.

FBXL19 also contains a ZF-CxxC domain, which is essential for its binding to non-methylated CpG islands, a function critical for its role in chromatin association and gene regulation (Dimitrova2018FBXL19). The ZF-CxxC domain is not involved in its interaction with the CDK-Mediator complex, which relies on the F-box domain (Dimitrova2018FBXL19).

Post-translational modifications of FBXL19 include ubiquitination, which is involved in the regulation of other proteins such as Rac1 and Rac3, targeting them for degradation (Dong2014Fbox; Zhao2013SCF). The protein's structure and domains enable it to perform diverse functions, including roles in cell migration and gene activation during cell differentiation. However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of FBXL19 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
FBXL19 is a nuclear protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of gene expression in embryonic stem (ES) cells. It is primarily involved in recruiting the CDK-Mediator complex to CpG islands of developmental genes, priming them for activation during cell differentiation. This recruitment is crucial for maintaining appropriate CDK8 occupancy at these promoters, which are often characterized by a bivalent chromatin state marked by H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 modifications (Dimitrova2018FBXL19a; Dimitrova2018FBXL19). FBXL19's ability to bind to non-methylated CpG islands is dependent on its ZF-CxxC domain, and mutations in this domain can significantly impair its chromatin binding ability (Dimitrova2018FBXL19).

FBXL19 also interacts with Rnf20, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, to facilitate histone H2B mono-ubiquitination (H2Bub1) at CpG island-containing promoters. This interaction is essential for the proper differentiation of ES cells, as FBXL19-depleted cells show impaired differentiation and fail to repress pluripotency markers (Lee2017Fbxl19). The protein's function in recognizing CpG islands and recruiting the CDK-Mediator complex is vital for the activation of silent developmental genes, necessary for proper lineage commitment and development (Dimitrova2018FBXL19a).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the FBXL19 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly through its role in protein degradation pathways. In psoriasis, specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near the FBXL19 gene, such as rs12924903, rs10782001, and rs12445568, have been associated with increased disease severity. These genetic variants may influence the skin's bacterial environment, particularly the abundance of Streptococcus, which correlates with psoriasis severity (Assarsson2024Significant).

In the context of cancer, FBXL19-AS1, a long non-coding RNA associated with the FBXL19 gene, is upregulated in various cancers, including colorectal cancer, cervical cancer, and osteosarcoma. In colorectal cancer, FBXL19-AS1 acts as an oncogene by sponging miR-203, promoting tumor growth and metastasis (Shen2017Long). In cervical cancer, it promotes cell proliferation and metastasis by interacting with miR-193a-5p (Huang2021LncRNA). In osteosarcoma, FBXL19-AS1 enhances cell proliferation and invasion by sponging miR-346 (Pan2018lncRNA).

FBXL19 is also involved in adipogenesis, where it is targeted by miR-26. This interaction plays a significant role in adipocyte progenitor differentiation and fat production, with implications for obesity and metabolic disorders (Acharya2019miR26).

## Interactions
FBXL19 is known to interact with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It is part of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, where it specifically targets proteins like Rac1 and Rac3 for ubiquitination and degradation. FBXL19 associates with Rac1 and Rac3, facilitating their polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation through the proteasome system (Dong2014Fbox; Zhao2013SCF).

In embryonic stem (ES) cells, FBXL19 interacts with the CDK-Mediator complex, which includes components such as CDK8/CDK19, MED12/12L, MED13/13L, and CCNC. This interaction is crucial for recruiting the CDK-Mediator to CpG islands of developmental genes, priming them for activation during differentiation (Dimitrova2018FBXL19; Dimitrova2018FBXL19a). FBXL19's interaction with the CDK-Mediator complex is mediated by its F-box domain, although it does not regulate the stability of the complex via the proteasome (Dimitrova2018FBXL19).

FBXL19 also binds to non-methylated CpG islands through its ZF-CxxC domain, a feature it shares with KDM2A and KDM2B, indicating its involvement in chromatin-related processes (Dimitrova2018FBXL19).
