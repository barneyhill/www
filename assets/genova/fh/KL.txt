# KL

## Overview
The KL gene encodes the α-Klotho protein, a type I single-pass transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in various physiological processes, particularly in the regulation of mineral metabolism and aging. α-Klotho is primarily expressed in the kidneys and brain, where it functions as a co-receptor for fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), influencing phosphate and vitamin D metabolism. This protein also acts as a hormone, modulating insulin and Wnt signaling pathways, and is involved in maintaining calcium and potassium homeostasis through its interaction with ion channels. The soluble form of α-Klotho, generated by proteolytic cleavage, circulates in the blood and exerts systemic effects, including antioxidative stress responses and modulation of cellular senescence. Alterations in KL gene expression or mutations can lead to various pathologies, including chronic kidney disease and vascular calcification, underscoring its clinical significance in age-related and metabolic disorders (Xu2015Molecular; Sopjani2015Intracellular; Neyra2020Klotho).

## Structure
The KL (klotho) gene encodes a type I single-pass transmembrane protein known as α-Klotho, which is primarily expressed in the kidney and brain. The protein has a molecular weight of approximately 130 kDa and consists of a short intracellular domain of about 10 amino acids, a single transmembrane domain, and a large extracellular domain containing two internal repeats, KL1 and KL2 (Dalton2017New; Kim2015Biological). These repeats share homology with family 1 glycosidases, although α-Klotho lacks the conserved glutamic acid residues necessary for typical catalytic activity, resulting in lower glycosidase activity compared to other family members (Xu2015Molecular; Dalton2017New).

The protein can undergo post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, and exists in multiple forms: a full-length transmembrane form, a shed soluble form, and a secreted truncated form produced by alternative splicing (Chen2020Identification; Xu2015Molecular). The soluble form is generated by cleavage of the extracellular domain by proteases such as ADAM10 and ADAM17, releasing it into the blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid, where it functions as a hormone (Dalton2017New; Kim2015Biological). The secreted form, which contains only the KL1 domain, is the major circulating form and may affect tissues that do not express Klotho (Xu2015Molecular).

## Function
The KL gene encodes the α-Klotho protein, which plays a crucial role in various molecular processes in healthy human cells. α-Klotho functions as a co-receptor for fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), facilitating phosphate and vitamin D metabolism, which is essential for maintaining calcium homeostasis and preventing hyperphosphatemia (Xu2015Molecular; Sopjani2015Intracellular). It also acts as a hormone, influencing insulin and Wnt signaling pathways, thereby regulating energy metabolism and cellular growth (Xu2015Molecular).

In the kidneys, α-Klotho modulates ion channels such as TRPV5 and ROMK1, affecting calcium and potassium reabsorption, which is vital for maintaining electrolyte balance (Xu2015Molecular). It also enhances resistance to oxidative stress by activating FoxO transcription factors, which increase the expression of antioxidant enzymes like mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) (Xu2015Molecular; Sopjani2015Intracellular).

α-Klotho is involved in the regulation of cellular senescence and aging processes, acting as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway, which reduces tumor cell proliferation and increases apoptosis (Xu2015Molecular; Sopjani2015Intracellular). Its expression is primarily found in the kidneys and brain, where it contributes to phosphate absorption and vitamin D metabolism (Xu2015Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the KL gene, which encodes the klotho protein, are associated with several diseases and conditions. A homozygous missense mutation (H193R) in the KL gene causes severe tumoral calcinosis, characterized by ectopic calcifications, hyperphosphatemia, and hypercalcemia. This mutation disrupts the FGF23-KL-FGFR1c complex formation, impairing FGF23 signaling and leading to elevated serum 1,25(OH)2D concentrations and mineral ion imbalance (Ichikawa2007A).

Klotho deficiency is linked to vascular calcification and other age-related vascular pathologies. In mice, Klotho deficiency results in vascular calcification similar to Mönckeberg's sclerosis, with increased expression of osteogenic markers and impaired endothelial function (Mencke2017The). In humans, Klotho deficiency is associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD), contributing to hyperphosphatemia, vascular calcification, and cardiovascular disease (Neyra2020Klotho).

Reduced Klotho expression in the kidney is linked to renal interstitial fibrosis, as seen in Klotho-deficient mice, which exhibit increased fibrosis markers and kidney damage (Sugiura2012Reduced). These findings highlight the clinical significance of KL gene mutations and altered expression in various metabolic and age-related disorders.

## Interactions
Klotho (KL) protein interacts with several key proteins and pathways, playing a significant role in cellular processes related to aging and stress response. Klotho acts as an antagonist to Wnt proteins, particularly Wnt3 and Wnt3a, which are involved in stem cell regulation and embryonic development. The KL1 domain of Klotho interacts with these Wnt proteins, and computational studies have identified specific residues in this domain that facilitate these interactions (Mirza2016Discovery).

Klotho also regulates the ASK1 signaling complex, which is sensitive to oxidative stress. It influences the monomerization and binding of the 14-3-3ζ protein to the ASK1 complex, thereby stabilizing the complex and preventing its dissociation under oxidative conditions. This interaction is crucial for modulating the p38 MAPK pathway, which is involved in stress-related aging disorders (Brobey2015Klotho).

Soluble Klotho (sKl) interacts with ion channels and transporters, such as the TRPV5 calcium channel, by modifying N-glycan chains to enhance their cell-surface abundance. sKl also binds to lipid rafts, influencing signaling pathways like PI3K/Akt and TRPC6, which are important for cardioprotection and endothelial function (Dalton2017New).
