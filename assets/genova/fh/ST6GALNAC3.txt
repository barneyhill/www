# ST6GALNAC3

## Overview
ST6GALNAC3 is a gene that encodes the enzyme ST6 N-acetylgalactosaminide alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase 3, a member of the sialyltransferase family. This enzyme is involved in the sialylation process, which is crucial for the modification of glycoproteins and glycolipids, impacting cellular recognition and adhesion. The protein is categorized as a glycosyltransferase and is primarily active in the Golgi apparatus, where it plays a significant role in cellular communication and immune response (Chukwudozie2020The; Hugonnet2021The). ST6GALNAC3 is highly expressed in the brain and kidney, where it contributes to the synthesis of complex gangliosides, such as GD1a, from a2,3-sialylated ganglioside GM1b (Hugonnet2021The). Alterations in the expression of ST6GALNAC3 have been linked to various cancers, suggesting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Pucci2022Glycosyltransferases; Xie2023Targeting).

## Function
ST6GALNAC3 encodes an enzyme that is part of the sialyltransferase family, which is involved in the sialylation process. This enzyme specifically transfers sialic acids from CMP-sialic acid to terminal positions of carbohydrate groups in glycoproteins and glycolipids, such as LAMP1, a process crucial for the function of glycoconjugates important for cell recognition and adhesion (Chukwudozie2020The). In healthy human cells, ST6GALNAC3 is highly expressed in the brain and kidney, where it uses a2,3-sialylated ganglioside GM1b as a substrate to synthesize the ganglioside GD1a (Hugonnet2021The). The enzyme is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it influences processes like immune response and cellular communication, impacting overall organismal homeostasis (Chukwudozie2020The).

The sialylation process mediated by ST6GALNAC3 affects cell-cell interactions, signaling, and the stability of glycoproteins, playing a significant role in maintaining cellular functions and organismal outcomes. Although the specific function of ST6GALNAC3 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its involvement in these molecular processes suggests its importance in cellular communication and homeostasis (Li2018Sialylation).

## Clinical Significance
ST6GALNAC3 is implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In lung cancer, the expression of ST6GALNAC3 is significantly reduced, contributing to aberrant sialylation patterns that may facilitate tumor development and metastasis (Pucci2022Glycosyltransferases; Xie2023Targeting). Similarly, in colorectal cancer (CRC), ST6GALNAC3 is downregulated, which is associated with tumor progression and chemoresistance (FernándezPonce2021The). These changes in expression suggest that ST6GALNAC3 plays a role in cancer cell proliferation and survival.

In prostate cancer, ST6GALNAC3 mRNA expression is upregulated in patients with high Gleason scores, indicating a potential role in cancer aggressiveness and progression (Li2023Integrative). Although the specific mechanisms by which ST6GALNAC3 influences these cancers are not fully detailed, its involvement in sialylation processes suggests it may affect cell-cell interactions and signaling pathways critical for cancer metastasis and immune evasion.

Overall, the dysregulation of ST6GALNAC3 expression is linked to the pathogenesis of several cancers, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for cancer prognosis and a target for therapeutic intervention. However, specific diseases or conditions directly resulting from mutations in the ST6GALNAC3 gene are not detailed in the available literature.
