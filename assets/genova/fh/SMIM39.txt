# SMIM39

## Overview
SMIM39 is a gene that encodes the small integral membrane protein 39, which is a transmembrane protein. This protein is characterized by its role in cellular processes that involve membrane integration and signaling pathways. As a transmembrane protein, small integral membrane protein 39 is embedded within the lipid bilayer of cellular membranes, where it may participate in various biological functions, including cell communication and molecular transport. The specific mechanisms and pathways involving SMIM39 are still under investigation, but its integral membrane nature suggests a potential role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and facilitating interactions between the cell and its environment. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise functions and clinical implications of SMIM39 in human health and disease.
