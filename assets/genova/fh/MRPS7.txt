# MRPS7

## Overview
The MRPS7 gene encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S7, a vital component of the small 28S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein is integral to mitochondrial protein synthesis, playing a crucial role in the translation of mitochondrial-encoded mRNAs into proteins essential for the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system. MRPS7 is homologous to the bacterial S7 ribosomal protein and is characterized by its interactions with 12S rRNA, which are essential for the assembly and function of the mitochondrial ribosome. Mutations in the MRPS7 gene can lead to significant clinical conditions, including congenital sensorineural deafness and mitochondrial disorders, due to impaired mitochondrial translation and energy production (Lopez2021Human; Menezes2015Mutation).

## Structure
The MRPS7 protein is a component of the small 28S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome, crucial for mitochondrial protein synthesis. The primary structure of MRPS7 consists of 242 amino acids, encoded by the MRPS7 gene (Menezes2015Mutation). The protein is homologous to the bacterial S7 ribosomal protein, with a molecular weight of approximately 24.3 kDa and an isoelectric point of 9.6 (O’Brien2003Properties).

In terms of tertiary structure, the wild-type MRPS7 protein features a hydrophobic core where the Met184 residue forms long-range hydrophobic interactions with neighboring residues such as Val90, Phe94, Met97, Phe145, and Leu149. These interactions are essential for stabilizing the protein's folded structure (Menezes2015Mutation). A mutation at this site, p.Met184Val, disrupts these interactions, leading to destabilization of the protein's tertiary structure and affecting its RNA-binding ability (Menezes2015Mutation).

The quaternary structure involves MRPS7's interaction with the 12S rRNA, as it is the only primary RNA-binding protein in this region of the mitochondrial ribosome (Menezes2015Mutation). This interaction is vital for the assembly and function of the mitochondrial ribosome's small subunit.

## Function
The MRPS7 gene encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S7, which is a crucial component of the small 28S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein plays a vital role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by interacting with 12S rRNA, facilitating its incorporation into the ribosomal complex. This interaction is essential for the stability and function of the mitochondrial ribosome, which is responsible for translating mitochondrial-encoded mRNAs into proteins that are integral to the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system (Menezes2015Mutation).

In healthy human cells, MRPS7 is necessary for the proper assembly and function of the mitochondrial ribosome, ensuring efficient mitochondrial translation. This process is critical for the synthesis of 13 mitochondrial-encoded subunits of the respiratory chain complexes I, III, and IV, which are essential for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation (Menezes2015Mutation). The protein's role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity is underscored by its involvement in stabilizing the mitochondrial network and supporting cellular energy metabolism (Menezes2015Mutation).

MRPS7 is active within the mitochondria, where it contributes to cellular energy production and overall cellular function, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular health and energy homeostasis (Menezes2015Mutation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MRPS7 gene are associated with several severe clinical conditions. A specific mutation, c.550A>G, resulting in the amino acid substitution p.Met184Val, has been linked to congenital sensorineural deafness, progressive hepatic and renal failure, and lactic acidemia. This mutation destabilizes the MRPS7 protein structure, impairing its RNA-binding ability and leading to reduced levels of 12S rRNA transcripts. Consequently, mitochondrial translation is impaired, resulting in deficiencies in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes I, III, and IV, and reduced ATP production (Menezes2015Mutation).

MRPS7 mutations have also been implicated in syndromic premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) and Perrault syndrome, which is characterized by sensorineural hearing loss and POI in females. Variants such as p.Arg179His and p.Lys125* are predicted to be pathogenic, affecting protein structure and function, potentially leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. These conditions highlight the gene's role in mitochondrial disorders and its impact on high-energy-demand processes like ovarian function (Kline2022Integral).

The clinical manifestations of MRPS7 mutations underscore the gene's critical role in maintaining mitochondrial function and its contribution to a spectrum of mitochondrial-related diseases.

## Interactions
MRPS7, a component of the mitochondrial ribosome's small 28S subunit, is involved in several critical interactions essential for mitochondrial protein synthesis. It primarily interacts with 12S rRNA, which is crucial for its role in the ribosome's functional domain (Lopez2021Human; Kline2022Integral). The protein also forms interactions with other mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, such as mS29 (DAP3), uS9m, and mS37, which are important for the stability and function of the mitochondrial ribosome (Lopez2021Human).

The mutation c.550A>G (p.Met184Val) in MRPS7 affects its stability and RNA-binding ability, leading to impaired mitochondrial translation and reduced 12S rRNA transcript levels (Lopez2021Human; Menezes2015Mutation). This mutation disrupts the hydrophobic interactions within the protein's core, which are essential for maintaining its structure and function (Menezes2015Mutation).

MRPS7 is also involved in broader cellular processes beyond its traditional role in the ribosome. It participates in the spliceosome pathway and interacts with non-mitoribosomal proteins, indicating potential roles in tumorigenic cellular processes (Revathi2021Expression). These interactions highlight the multifaceted roles of MRPS7 in cellular and mitochondrial functions.
