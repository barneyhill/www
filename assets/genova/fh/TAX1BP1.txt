# TAX1BP1

## Overview
TAX1BP1 (Tax1 binding protein 1) is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, including autophagy and the regulation of NF-κB signaling pathways. The protein, Tax1 binding protein 1, is characterized by its complex structure, which includes a SKIP carboxyl homology (SKICH) domain, coiled-coil domains, and C2H2-type zinc fingers, enabling it to function as an autophagy receptor and a regulator of immune responses (Yang2014Crystallographic). TAX1BP1 plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by facilitating the selective clearance of protein aggregates, a process known as aggrephagy, and by acting as a negative regulator of NF-κB signaling to prevent chronic inflammation (Shembade2011The; Sarraf2019Selective). Dysregulation of TAX1BP1 has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases and inflammatory disorders, highlighting its significance in human health (Sarraf2020Loss; Nakano2013Commensal).

## Structure
TAX1BP1 (Tax1 binding protein 1) is a human protein characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. The protein contains a SKIP carboxyl homology (SKICH) domain at the N-terminus, which is crucial for its role as an autophagy receptor and its interaction with LC3/GABARAP proteins involved in autophagy (Yang2014Crystallographic). The SKICH domain exhibits an immunoglobulin (Ig)-like fold, featuring a β-barrel structure formed by nine β-strands and two short α-helices, creating a two-layer sandwich structure (Yang2014Crystallographic). This domain is stabilized by proline-aromatic and aromatic-aromatic π-stacking interactions, which are unique to the TAX1BP1 family (Yang2014Crystallographic).

The central region of TAX1BP1 includes a coiled-coil domain with three coiled-coil and two helix-loop-helix motifs, contributing to its structural integrity and facilitating protein-protein interactions (Yang2014Crystallographic). The C-terminal region contains two C2H2-type zinc fingers (UBZs) that function as ubiquitin-binding domains, essential for its role in regulating NF-κB and IRF3 signaling pathways (Yang2014Crystallographic).

TAX1BP1 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its interactions with other proteins like NAP1 (Fu2018Mechanistic). There are two isoforms of TAX1BP1 in humans, with isoform 2 being the predominant form (Yang2014Crystallographic).

## Function
TAX1BP1 (Tax1 binding protein 1) is a multifunctional protein involved in several critical cellular processes, primarily autophagy and the regulation of NF-κB signaling. In the context of autophagy, TAX1BP1 acts as an autophagy receptor that facilitates the selective clearance of protein aggregates, a process known as aggrephagy. It is recruited to stress-induced protein aggregates and is essential for their clearance, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing toxicity associated with neurodegenerative diseases (Sarraf2019Selective). TAX1BP1 is highly expressed in the brain and is involved in the clearance of ubiquitin-positive protein aggregates, particularly in neuronal cells (Sarraf2019Selective).

TAX1BP1 also plays a significant role in the regulation of NF-κB signaling pathways. It functions as a critical negative regulator by downregulating the polyubiquitination of RIP1 and TRAF6, which are involved in the signaling pathways of the TNF receptor and IL-1 receptor. This regulation is crucial for terminating NF-κB signaling and preventing chronic inflammation (Shembade2011The). TAX1BP1's activity is modulated by phosphorylation, which is necessary for its function in the A20 ubiquitin-editing complex, further highlighting its role in immune response regulation (Shembade2011The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the TAX1BP1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly those involving inflammation and neurodegeneration. The loss of TAX1BP1 impairs the clearance of protein aggregates in the brain, leading to their accumulation and contributing to neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease, and Alzheimer's disease (Sarraf2020Loss). TAX1BP1 is crucial for the ubiquitin-dependent clearance of these aggregates via autophagy, and its dysfunction may exacerbate proteotoxic stresses (Sarraf2020Loss).

In the context of inflammation, TAX1BP1 plays a role in regulating the NF-kB signaling pathway. Deficiencies in TAX1BP1 lead to uncontrolled NF-kB activation, resulting in systemic inflammation and conditions such as chronic endocarditis in mice (Nakano2013Commensal). TAX1BP1 deficiency is also associated with increased hepatic inflammation and a higher incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma, as seen in murine models (Waidmann2020Tax1BP1). These findings suggest that TAX1BP1 is a critical modulator of inflammation and its loss or dysfunction can lead to significant pathological conditions.

## Interactions
TAX1BP1 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular signaling and autophagy. It binds to the LIR motif of NBR1 via its N-domain, involving specific residues such as Y449 and L442 in TAX1BP1 and F740 in NBR1. This interaction is essential for the recruitment of TAX1BP1 to p62 condensates, which is critical for autophagic degradation (Bauer2024Mechanism). TAX1BP1 also interacts with TBK1, a pro-autophagic factor, through the NAP1/SINTBAD adapters, facilitating the recruitment of TBK1 to p62 condensates (Bauer2024Mechanism).

In the context of NF-κB signaling, TAX1BP1 interacts with the kinase IKKα, with phosphorylation at Ser624 being crucial for this interaction. This phosphorylation is necessary for the recruitment of the A20 ubiquitin-editing complex to TRAF2 and TRAF6, which is important for terminating NF-κB signaling (Shembade2011The). TAX1BP1 also interacts with the E3 ligase Itch via PPXY motifs, which are exposed upon phosphorylation by IKKα, facilitating the recruitment of cofactors like Itch, RNF11, and A20 (Shembade2011The).

TAX1BP1 acts as a Myosin VI cargo adaptor, contributing to autophagosome maturation, and interacts with the deubiquitinase A20, linking it to immune response regulation (Sarraf2019Selective).
