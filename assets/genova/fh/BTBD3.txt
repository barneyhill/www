# BTBD3

## Overview
BTBD3 is a gene that encodes the BTB domain-containing 3 protein, which plays a pivotal role in neuronal development and cellular signaling. The BTBD3 protein is characterized by the presence of a BTB/POZ domain, which is involved in transcriptional repression through dimerization and recruitment of co-repressors (Matsui2013BTBD3). Functioning as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, BTBD3 is integral to the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, impacting processes such as colorectal cancer tumorigenesis (Ye2024E3). In the nervous system, BTBD3 is crucial for the orientation of dendrites in response to neuronal activity, facilitating the formation of neural circuits necessary for sensory information processing (Matsui2013BTBD3). Additionally, BTBD3's interaction with cytoskeletal proteins, mediated by acetylation through the Naa10 enzyme, underscores its role in maintaining actin dynamics essential for neurite outgrowth (Chou2024Naa10). The gene's involvement in both cancer biology and neurological development highlights its clinical significance, particularly in conditions such as obsessive-compulsive disorder and colorectal cancer (Ye2024E3; Thompson2019Btbd3).

## Function
The BTBD3 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in the orientation of dendrites in response to neuronal activity in the mammalian neocortex. This protein is crucial for the proper formation of neural circuits, which are essential for processing sensory information. BTBD3 translocates from the cytosol to the nucleus in response to neuronal activity, suggesting it may control transcriptional programs to trim excess dendrites in the developing mouse somatosensory cortex (Matsui2013BTBD3). 

BTBD3 is involved in dendritic orientation toward active axons, a process that is conserved across species, including ferrets and marmosets. This orientation is vital for high-acuity sensory function and proper neural circuit formation (Matsui2013BTBD3). The protein contains a BTB/POZ domain, which is involved in transcriptional repression through dimerization and recruitment of co-repressors (Matsui2013BTBD3).

In the hippocampus, BTBD3 is acetylated by the Naa10 enzyme, which promotes its interaction with cytoskeletal proteins like CapZb and F-actin. This interaction is crucial for maintaining actin dynamics, which supports neurite outgrowth and neuronal network formation (Chou2024Naa10).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the BTBD3 gene have been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric conditions. BTBD3 has been identified as a potential risk gene for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Studies in mice have shown that changes in BTBD3 expression can lead to compulsive-like behaviors and reduced exploration, which are relevant to OCD. These behaviors include excessive barbering, impaired goal-directed behavior, and increased wheel-running. The study also found that fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor effective in treating OCD, reduced compulsive behaviors in mice with altered BTBD3 expression, suggesting a link between BTBD3 and OCD-related behaviors (Thompson2019Btbd3).

In addition to its role in OCD, BTBD3 is involved in colorectal cancer (CRC). It functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that inhibits tumorigenesis by regulating the TYRO3/Wnt/β-catenin signaling axis. BTBD3 expression is significantly downregulated in CRC tissues, and its overexpression in CRC cell lines reduces cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, indicating its potential as a tumor suppressor (Ye2024E3).

BTBD3 is also involved in neurite outgrowth through its interaction with the Naa10 gene. Naa10 acetylates BTBD3, which is crucial for maintaining actin dynamics necessary for neurite formation. This interaction suggests a role for BTBD3 in neurological development and disorders (Chou2024Naa10).

## Interactions
BTBD3 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It interacts with β-catenin and TYRO3 within the same protein complex, primarily localized in the cytoplasm. These interactions have been demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) studies and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments (Ye2024E3). BTBD3 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, ubiquitinating β-catenin, which leads to its degradation. This interaction is crucial for regulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is involved in colorectal cancer (CRC) tumorigenesis (Ye2024E3).

In the context of neuronal development, BTBD3 is a substrate of Naa10, which N-α-acetylates BTBD3. This acetylation enhances BTBD3's interaction with cytoskeleton proteins such as CapZb and F-actin, which are involved in actin dynamics crucial for neurite outgrowth (Chou2024Naa10). The Naa10-BTBD3-CapZb-F-actin axis is essential for maintaining F-actin dynamics, which are vital for neurite outgrowth and neuronal network formation (Chou2024Naa10). These interactions highlight BTBD3's role in both cancer biology and neuronal development.
