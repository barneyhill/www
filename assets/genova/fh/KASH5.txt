# KASH5

## Overview
KASH5 is a gene that encodes the KASH domain containing 5 protein, a critical component of the LINC (Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton) complex. This protein plays a pivotal role in meiotic chromosome dynamics by facilitating the connection between chromosomes and the cytoskeleton. The KASH5 protein is characterized as a transmembrane protein, featuring several domains, including a KASH domain, which is essential for its localization to the nuclear envelope and interaction with SUN proteins (Horn2013A; Hou2023A). Functionally, KASH5 acts as an adaptor for the cytoplasmic dynein motor complex, enabling the recruitment of dynein to telomere attachment sites, which is crucial for chromosome movement and homologous chromosome pairing during meiosis (Horn2013A; Yang2022Novel). Mutations in the KASH5 gene have been linked to reproductive disorders, including meiotic arrest and infertility, underscoring its importance in gametogenesis and genetic stability (Hou2023A; Yang2022Novel).

## Structure
The KASH5 protein, also known as CCDC155, is a component of the LINC complex, which is crucial for linking meiotic chromosomes to the cytoskeleton. The protein is composed of 562 amino acids and includes several distinct domains: an N-terminal domain, a central coiled-coil region, a C-terminal KASH domain, a transmembrane domain (TMD), and a leucine-rich domain (Hou2023A; Yang2022Novel). The N-terminal domain contains a calmodulin-like EF hand sequence, which is important for its interaction with the dynein motor complex (Horn2013A). The central coiled-coil domain facilitates self-association and oligomerization, contributing to the protein's structural stability (Horn2013A; Yang2022Novel).

The C-terminal KASH domain is essential for targeting KASH5 to the outer nuclear membrane and interacting with SUN proteins, forming part of the LINC complex (Horn2013A). The transmembrane domain, which includes a stretch of leucine residues, is crucial for proper localization to the nuclear envelope, and alterations in its hydrophobicity can lead to mislocalization (Bentebbal2021A). The protein's structure allows it to play a vital role in meiotic chromosome dynamics and nuclear envelope remodeling (Yang2022Novel).

## Function
The KASH5 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the LINC (Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton) complex, which plays a vital role in meiotic chromosome dynamics. In healthy human cells, KASH5 is highly expressed in spermatocytes during meiosis, particularly in the prophase I stage, where it localizes to the nuclear envelope (NE) and the tips of chromosomes (Horn2013A; Yang2022Novel). KASH5 functions as an adaptor for cytoplasmic dynein, a motor protein, facilitating its recruitment to telomere attachment sites at the NE. This recruitment is essential for the proper pairing and synapsis of homologous chromosomes, as well as for the dynamic movement of telomeres during meiosis (Horn2013A; Hou2023A).

The interaction between KASH5 and SUN1, another component of the LINC complex, is crucial for the mechanical force-mediated movement of chromosomes, which is necessary for homolog pairing, synapse formation, and chromosome segregation (Horn2013A; Yang2022Novel). The absence or dysfunction of KASH5 leads to meiotic arrest and infertility, highlighting its essential role in gametogenesis and genetic stability (Hou2023A; Yang2022Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KASH5 gene are associated with several reproductive disorders. A homozygous frameshift mutation in KASH5 has been linked to diminished ovarian reserve, recurrent miscarriage, and non-obstructive azoospermia in humans. This mutation results in a premature stop codon, leading to either a truncated protein or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, causing an absence of KASH5 protein in testicular cells. In males, this absence leads to meiotic arrest before the pachytene stage, with massive double-strand breaks remaining unrepaired, resulting in non-obstructive azoospermia. In females, the mutation is associated with recurrent miscarriage, likely due to aneuploid embryos (Hou2023A).

Another variant, involving a substitution of leucine with glutamine at position 535 (L535Q), affects the KASH5 transmembrane domain. This substitution alters the hydrophobicity of the domain, causing the KASH5 protein to mislocalize from the nuclear envelope to the mitochondria. This mislocalization is linked to azoospermia due to spermatogenesis arrest (Bentebbal2021A).

Novel bi-allelic variants in KASH5 have also been associated with meiotic arrest and non-obstructive azoospermia, characterized by impaired homolog pairing and synapsis during meiosis (Yang2022Novel).

## Interactions
KASH5 is a component of the meiotic LINC complex and acts as an activating adaptor for cytoplasmic dynein. It interacts with dynein through its N-terminal EF-hand domain, which is crucial for binding. This interaction is essential for the recruitment of dynein to the nuclear envelope and is independent of calcium, although mutations in the EF-hand domain can disrupt this binding (Garner2022The). KASH5 also recruits LIS1 and dynactin, which are important for dynein function, particularly in high-force scenarios (Garner2022The). 

KASH5 competes with other dynein adaptors such as BICD2 and Rab11-FIP3 for dynein binding, indicating its role in modulating dynein activity (Garner2022The). In HeLa cells, KASH5 and dynein often cluster around the centrosome, suggesting a strong interaction (Garner2022The). KASH5 forms a complex with dynein, dynactin, and LIS1, which is essential for its function in meiotic chromosome movements (Garner2022The). The interaction with dynein is mediated by the light intermediate chain (LIC) helix 1 region, and KASH5 can recruit dynein independently of dynactin, although LIS1 is necessary for full complex assembly (Horn2013A; Garner2022The).
