# RARA

## Overview
The RARA gene encodes the retinoic acid receptor alpha, a nuclear hormone receptor that plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression by binding to retinoic acid, a derivative of vitamin A. This receptor is categorized as a nuclear receptor and is involved in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. The protein encoded by RARA functions primarily in the nucleus, where it forms heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor (RXRA) to bind to retinoic acid response elements (RAREs) in the promoters of target genes, thereby influencing transcriptional activity (Nagpal1993RARs; De2014RARAfusion). RARA is particularly significant in hematopoiesis, where it is essential for the differentiation of promyelocytes into mature granulocytes, and in the immune system, where it influences T cell differentiation and promotes regulatory T cell formation (Conserva2019The; Collins2002The). Alterations in the RARA gene, such as the formation of fusion proteins, are implicated in acute promyelocytic leukemia, underscoring its clinical significance (Orfali2014Retinoid; De2014RARAfusion).

## Structure
The RARA (retinoic acid receptor alpha) protein is a nuclear hormone receptor that plays a crucial role in gene regulation. It is composed of several domains, including the A and B domains, which contain the AF-1 ligand-independent transcriptional activation domain, and the C domain, which includes two zinc finger motifs essential for binding to retinoic acid response elements (RAREs) in gene promoters (De2014RARAfusion). The D domain contains a cellular localization signal known as the hinge region, while the E domain is critical for dimerization with the retinoid X receptor (RXRA) and contains the AF-2 ligand-dependent transcriptional activation domain (De2014RARAfusion).

The tertiary structure of RARA includes a ligand-binding domain located at the C-terminus, which is vital for ligand recognition and protein-protein interactions (Lefebvre1995Structural). The ligand-binding domain is characterized by a mixed alpha/beta structure, with specific regions such as the C-terminal end of the E domain being crucial for high-affinity ligand binding (Lefebvre1995Structural). RARA can form homodimers or heterodimers with RXRA, which is essential for its function as a transcription activator (Osz2020Structural). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which may affect its function and interactions.

## Function
The RARA gene encodes the retinoic acid receptor alpha, a nuclear hormone receptor that plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression by binding to retinoic acid, a derivative of vitamin A. RARA functions primarily in the nucleus, where it forms heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor (RXRA) to bind to retinoic acid response elements (RAREs) in the promoters of target genes, influencing transcriptional activity (Nagpal1993RARs; De2014RARAfusion). This receptor is involved in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis.

In hematopoiesis, RARA is crucial for the differentiation of promyelocytes into mature granulocytes, a process that is essential for normal blood cell development (Collins2002The). The presence of retinoic acid activates RARA, leading to the recruitment of coactivators and the transcriptional activation of genes necessary for cell differentiation (De2014RARAfusion). RARA also plays a significant role in the immune system by influencing T cell differentiation and promoting regulatory T cell formation, which is vital for maintaining immune balance and tolerance (Conserva2019The).

RARA's activity is modulated by its interaction with RXRA and the presence of retinoic acid, which enhances its transcriptional activation capabilities (Nagpal1993RARs). The receptor's function is not only dependent on ligand concentration but also on developmental regulation during different stages of cell differentiation (Collins2002The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RARA gene are primarily associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia. APL is characterized by the accumulation of abnormal promyelocytes due to a differentiation block, often caused by the fusion of the RARA gene with other genes, most commonly the PML gene, resulting in the PML-RARA fusion protein. This fusion protein disrupts normal retinoic acid signaling by binding to retinoic acid response elements and recruiting repressive complexes, blocking the transcription of genes necessary for myeloid differentiation (Orfali2014Retinoid; De2014RARAfusion).

The PML-RARA fusion is present in about 98% of APL cases and is sensitive to treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), although resistance can occur (De2014RARAfusion). Other RARA fusion genes, such as ZBTB16-RARA and NPM1-RARA, are less common but contribute to the complexity of APL pathogenesis (Liquori2020Acute). The FIP1L1-RARA fusion gene, identified in a t(4;17) translocation, is another variant associated with APL and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), highlighting the phenotypic diversity among RARA rearranged leukemias (Kondo2008The; Buijs2007Fusion).

## Interactions
The retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) is involved in various protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions that are crucial for its role in transcriptional regulation. RARA forms heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), which bind to retinoic acid response elements (RAREs) on DNA to regulate gene expression. This interaction is essential for the differentiation of promyelocytes and is modulated by the presence of retinoic acid (De2014RARAfusion).

RARA interacts with coactivators and corepressors to modulate transcription. In the absence of retinoic acid, RARA recruits corepressors such as N-CoR and SMRT, which are associated with histone deacetylases, leading to transcriptional repression. Upon ligand binding, RARA undergoes conformational changes that facilitate the recruitment of coactivators like TIF-1 and CBP, resulting in transcriptional activation (Cordeiro2018Interplay; De2014RARAfusion).

RARA also interacts with the Epstein-Barr virus protein BZLF1, forming a heteromeric complex that can bind to DNA. This interaction involves the DNA-binding domain of RARA and the coiled-coil dimerization domain of BZLF1, allowing RARA to be tethered to DNA through BZLF1, despite not directly recognizing BZLF1 binding sites (Deshmane1995Physical; Pfitzner1995Functional).
