# ZNF700

## Overview
ZNF700 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 700, a member of the zinc finger protein family known for their role in transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger proteins are characterized by their ability to bind DNA and influence gene expression, often acting as transcription factors. ZNF700 is located on chromosome 19 and is involved in various cellular processes, including chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. The protein encoded by ZNF700 has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer and neurological disorders, due to its regulatory functions and interactions with other cellular components (Yu2023Screening; Laan2020DNA).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF700 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in transcriptional regulation. In prostate cancer (PRAD), ZNF700 is identified as a potential tumor antigen and is associated with worse overall survival and disease-free interval in patients with higher expression levels. This suggests that ZNF700 may play a role in inducing immunogenic cell death in tumor cells, potentially triggering an immune response (Yu2023Screening). 

In Down syndrome, ZNF700 is part of a cluster of zinc finger genes on chromosome 19 that exhibit differential methylation, which may contribute to transcriptional dysregulation observed in the condition. This dysregulation is linked to changes in chromatin structure and gene expression in neural cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (Laan2020DNA).

ZNF700 is also mentioned in the context of ovarian carcinomas, where it shows a DNA gain ratio, indicating a potential association with gene expression changes in these cancers (Smebye2014Chromosome). Additionally, ZNF700 is noted for its dysregulation in neurological disorders such as Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, suggesting a broader impact on neurological health (Satu2018Bioinformatics).
