# TRPM3

## Overview
The TRPM3 gene encodes the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 3, a non-selective cation channel that is part of the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family. This protein is characterized by its six transmembrane domains and a conserved TRP motif, playing a crucial role in sensory perception, particularly in the detection of noxious heat and pain (Vriens2018Sensing; Oberwinkler2014TRPM3). TRPM3 is activated by various stimuli, including heat and the neurosteroid pregnenolone sulfate, and is involved in several physiological processes such as insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells and modulation of neuronal activity in the brain (Quallo2017G; Held2021TRPM3). The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms with distinct functional properties (Held2020Pharmacological). Mutations in TRPM3 have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Roelens2024Neurodevelopmental).

## Structure
The TRPM3 protein is a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family and is characterized by six transmembrane domains, a conserved TRP motif, and a coiled-coil region in its C terminus (Oberwinkler2014TRPM3). The coiled-coil region is crucial for the assembly of TRPM subunits, facilitating homomultimeric interactions (Oberwinkler2014TRPM3). Unlike other TRP proteins, TRPM3 lacks ankyrin repeats (Oberwinkler2014TRPM3).

TRPM3 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms, such as TRPM3α1 and TRPM3α2, which differ in their pore loop regions (Held2020Pharmacological). These isoforms exhibit distinct pharmacological properties, with the length of the pore loop significantly affecting their response to various ligands (Held2020Pharmacological). The splicing within exon 24 results in a 13 amino acid difference between TRPM3α1 and TRPM3α2, influencing ion permeability and sensitivity to inhibitors (Oberwinkler2014TRPM3).

The TRPM3 protein includes calmodulin binding sites, which are involved in Ca2+-dependent regulation. These sites are variably present across different isoforms due to alternative splicing (Przibilla2018Ca2+dependent). The protein also interacts with phospholipids like PtdIns(4,5)P2, which play a central role in channel regulation (Oberwinkler2014TRPM3).

## Function
TRPM3 is a non-selective cation channel that plays a significant role in various physiological processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in sensory perception, particularly in the detection of noxious heat and pain, functioning as a heat sensor in the somatosensory system. TRPM3 is activated by both physical and chemical stimuli, including heat and the endogenous neurosteroid pregnenolone sulfate (PS), which potentiates its activation by heat (Vriens2018Sensing; Quallo2017G). 

In pancreatic beta cells, TRPM3 activation induces insulin secretion by stimulating voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and complex signaling pathways. It also serves as a regulated Zn2+ entry pathway, crucial for insulin biosynthesis and storage (Held2021TRPM3). In the peripheral nervous system, TRPM3 contributes to noxious heat sensation, neuropeptide release, and inflammatory hyperalgesia (Held2021TRPM3). 

TRPM3 channels are also expressed in the brain, where they may influence movement coordination, ion homeostasis, and memory formation. In the hippocampus, TRPM3 activation enhances long-term potentiation, potentially improving memory (Held2021TRPM3). The channel's activity is modulated by G-protein-coupled receptors, which can inhibit TRPM3 through the G-protein βγ subunits, affecting its role in pain sensation (Quallo2017G).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TRPM3 gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEE). These conditions are characterized by seizures, intellectual disabilities, and developmental delays. Specific mutations, such as p.Val837Met, have been identified in individuals with DEE, leading to symptoms like moderate to severe developmental delays, hypotonia, and epilepsy (Roelens2024Neurodevelopmental; Dyment2019De). 

TRPM3 mutations often result in a gain-of-function effect, increasing the channel's activity and sensitivity to stimuli. This heightened activity is linked to various symptoms, including altered pain sensitivity, skeletal anomalies, and autism-like behaviors (Roelens2024Neurodevelopmental; Zhao2021The). The gene's expression in the brain, particularly in excitatory neurons, may contribute to seizure induction and neurodevelopmental issues (Roelens2024Neurodevelopmental).

Alterations in TRPM3 expression have also been implicated in other conditions, such as mood and anxiety disorders, and it has been suggested as a potential target for anticonvulsant drugs like primidone (Held2021TRPM3). The gene's role in sensory neurons and its involvement in heat sensation further highlight its clinical significance (Zhao2021The).

## Interactions
TRPM3 interacts with several proteins and molecules, playing a significant role in various physiological processes. It forms tetrameric quaternary structures and can create multimers with TRPM1 proteins, indicating its involvement in complex protein assemblies (Behrendt2019Transient). TRPM3 interacts with calmodulin, a Ca2+-binding protein, which modulates its channel activity. This interaction is complex, with five calmodulin binding sites identified in the TRPM3α2 protein, suggesting a sophisticated regulatory mechanism (Przibilla2018Ca2+dependent). The binding of calmodulin to TRPM3 is Ca2+-dependent, with specific lysine residues playing a crucial role in this interaction (Przibilla2018Ca2+dependent).

TRPM3 also interacts with membrane phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs), particularly PI(3,4,5)P3, which enhances its channel activity (Behrendt2019Transient). The interaction with PI(4,5)P2 is crucial for TRPM3's regulation, with specific residues in the pre-S1 segment, S4-S5 loop, and TRP domain identified as key for binding (Zhao2022Computational). G-protein βγ subunits, released by G-protein coupled receptors, form complexes with TRPM3 and inhibit its activity, particularly in sensory neurons (Zhao2022Computational; Behrendt2019Transient). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory network involving TRPM3 and its role in cellular signaling.
