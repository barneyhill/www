# MTOR

## Overview
The MTOR gene encodes the mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase, a serine/threonine kinase that is pivotal in regulating cell growth, proliferation, and metabolism. This kinase is a central component of two distinct protein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, each of which plays unique roles in cellular signaling pathways. mTORC1 primarily responds to nutrient availability and growth factors to regulate anabolic processes, while mTORC2 is involved in cytoskeletal organization and cell survival. The MTOR gene and its encoded protein are integral to maintaining cellular homeostasis and are implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including cancer, metabolic disorders, and neurological diseases (Kim2002mTOR; Laplante2012mTOR; Crino2016The).

## Structure
The mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in cell growth and metabolism. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the protein. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stability and function. The tertiary structure of MTOR involves the 3D folding of the protein, which is essential for its activity and interaction with other molecules. MTOR is part of two complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, which are involved in different cellular processes.

MTOR contains several specific domains, including the HEAT repeat domain, FAT domain, kinase domain, and FATC domain. These domains are critical for its function and interactions with other proteins. The HEAT repeat domain is involved in protein-protein interactions, while the kinase domain is responsible for its enzymatic activity. The FAT and FATC domains are involved in the regulation of MTOR's activity and stability.

MTOR undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which regulate its activity and interactions. Splice variant isoforms of MTOR also exist, which may have different functions or regulatory mechanisms. These structural features and modifications are crucial for MTOR's role in cellular signaling and metabolism.

## Function
The MTOR gene encodes a serine/threonine kinase that is a central component of two distinct complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, which play crucial roles in cellular and organismal homeostasis. mTORC1 integrates signals from nutrients, growth factors, and cellular energy status to regulate anabolic and catabolic processes. It promotes protein synthesis, lipid and nucleotide biosynthesis, and inhibits autophagy, thereby supporting cell growth and proliferation (Laplante2012mTOR; MarquesRamos2023Expression). mTORC1 is activated by amino acids, particularly leucine, and growth factors, which involve the Rag GTPases and the Ragulator complex facilitating its translocation to the lysosomal surface (Kim2002mTOR; Laplante2012mTOR).

mTORC2, primarily activated by growth factors, regulates cytoskeletal organization and cell survival through the phosphorylation of AGC kinases such as Akt, SGK1, and PKC-a (Laplante2012mTOR; MarquesRamos2023Expression). It is involved in glucose metabolism and is associated with the plasma membrane (Zoncu2010mTOR:). Both complexes are involved in feedback loops that regulate their activity, ensuring that cells grow only under favorable conditions (MarquesRamos2023Expression). mTOR signaling is integral to maintaining metabolic balance and responding to nutrient availability, impacting processes like muscle mass regulation, glucose homeostasis, and insulin secretion (Laplante2012mTOR).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and dysregulation of the MTOR gene are implicated in a variety of neurological disorders. These include epilepsy, autism, intellectual disability, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease (Crino2016The). In particular, somatic mutations in MTOR are associated with focal cortical dysplasia type IIb, a condition characterized by abnormal brain development and epilepsy (Nakashima2015Somatic). These mutations lead to constitutive activation of the mTOR pathway, resulting in increased phosphorylation of downstream targets like ribosomal protein S6, which is linked to the pathogenesis of the disorder (Nakashima2015Somatic).

MTOR mutations are also linked to hemimegalencephaly, a condition involving abnormal brain growth, where mutations are found in a mosaic distribution within the brain (Lee2012De). In tuberous sclerosis complex, mTOR inhibitors such as sirolimus and everolimus have shown effectiveness in reducing seizures, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting mTOR signaling in related conditions (Curatolo2018mTOR). The involvement of mTOR in these disorders underscores its critical role in neural development and the potential consequences of its dysregulation.

## Interactions
The mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase that forms two distinct complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, each with unique protein interactions and functions. mTORC1 includes Raptor, mLST8, PRAS40, and DEPTOR. Raptor is a key component that positively regulates mTORC1 activity, facilitating substrate recruitment and signaling to the cell growth machinery (Kim2002mTOR; Kim2019mTOR). DEPTOR acts as an inhibitor of mTORC1, while PRAS40 mediates growth factor and Akt signals to the complex (Kim2019mTOR).

mTORC2, on the other hand, contains Rictor, mSin1, and Protor, and is involved in regulating the cytoskeleton and cell survival. Rictor is crucial for substrate recruitment in mTORC2 and its binding to mTOR is mutually exclusive with Raptor (JhanwarUniyal2019Diverse; Dos2004Rictor). mTORC2 phosphorylates AGC protein kinases, including PKB/Akt, PKC, and SGK1, influencing cell growth and survival (Kim2019mTOR).

The interaction of mTOR with these proteins is sensitive to environmental cues such as nutrient availability and growth factors, which regulate its activity and downstream effects (Caron2010A; Kim2019mTOR). The FKBP12-rapamycin complex inhibits mTORC1 but not mTORC2, highlighting the differential sensitivity of these complexes to rapamycin (Kim2019mTOR).
