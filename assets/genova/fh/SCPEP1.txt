# SCPEP1

## Overview
SCPEP1, or serine carboxypeptidase 1, is a gene that encodes a lysosomal enzyme involved in the regulation of vasoconstriction through the inactivation of endothelin-1 (ET-1), a potent vasoconstrictor. The protein product of SCPEP1 is categorized as a serine carboxypeptidase, which functions by cleaving the C-terminal amino acid from ET-1, thereby contributing to its degradation and inactivation. This enzymatic activity is crucial for maintaining normal blood pressure and vascular tone, as it modulates ET-1 levels in the body (Pan2014Serine). SCPEP1 is highly expressed in the kidney, lungs, and heart, and is localized to lysosomes, where it shares functional similarities with cathepsin A (CathA), another serine carboxypeptidase. Together, SCPEP1 and CathA play complementary roles in cardiovascular homeostasis by ensuring the proper turnover of ET-1, thus preventing excessive vasoconstriction and hypertension (Pan2014Serine). Additionally, SCPEP1 has been implicated in various cellular signaling pathways and conditions, including cancer biology and epilepsy, highlighting its potential regulatory roles in diverse biological processes (Konje2022Identification; Wang2024Identification).

## Function
SCPEP1 (serine carboxypeptidase 1) is a lysosomal enzyme involved in the regulation of vasoconstriction through the inactivation of endothelin-1 (ET-1), a potent vasoconstrictor. It functions by cleaving the C-terminal amino acid from ET-1, contributing to its degradation and inactivation. This activity is crucial for maintaining normal blood pressure and vascular tone, as SCPEP1 helps modulate the levels of ET-1 in the body (Pan2014Serine).

SCPEP1 is highly expressed in the kidney, lungs, and heart, and is localized to lysosomes, where it shares similarities with other serine carboxypeptidases, particularly cathepsin A (CathA). Both SCPEP1 and CathA play complementary roles in cardiovascular homeostasis by ensuring the proper turnover of ET-1, thus preventing excessive vasoconstriction and hypertension (Pan2014Serine).

In healthy cells, SCPEP1's enzymatic activity is essential for the regulation of blood pressure and vascular function. Its role in ET-1 degradation highlights its importance in cardiovascular health, and its expression can be induced by retinoic acid, suggesting potential therapeutic applications for conditions involving ET-1 degradation deficiencies (Pan2014Serine).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the SCPEP1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in conditions related to endothelin-1 (ET-1) dysregulation. Mice deficient in both SCPEP1 and cathepsin A (CathA) exhibit prolonged ET-1 half-life, leading to systemic hypertension and hyperproliferative conditions such as corneal dystrophy and skin thickening (Pan2017Mice). These findings suggest that SCPEP1 plays a crucial role in maintaining ET-1 balance, and its deficiency can result in increased ET-1 levels, causing enhanced cell proliferation and activation of ERK1/2 and AKT kinases (Pan2017Mice).

The double deficiency of SCPEP1 and CathA in mice leads to reduced degradation of ET-1, resulting in increased arterial blood pressure and heightened response to ET-1. This condition is associated with hyperproliferative vesicular corneal dystrophy and hypertrophic skin thickenings, with about 30% of older mice developing corneal cloudiness leading to blindness (Pan2017Mice). These pathological changes are due to increased proliferation of stromal fibroblasts and accumulation of fibrotic extracellular matrix, resembling human corneal dystrophies (Pan2017Mice). The study indicates that normal activities of SCPEP1 are essential for balancing ET-1 turnover, which is important for eye and skin health (Pan2017Mice).

## Interactions
SCPEP1 (serine carboxypeptidase 1) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In the context of lysosomal function, SCPEP1 interacts with Cathepsin A (CathA) to regulate the degradation of endothelin-1 (ET-1), a peptide that affects cell proliferation and blood pressure. Mice deficient in both SCPEP1 and CathA exhibit increased ET-1 levels, leading to enhanced cellular proliferation and conditions such as corneal dystrophy and skin thickening. This suggests that SCPEP1 plays a role in modulating ET-1 signaling pathways, potentially through interactions with ET-1 receptors or related signaling molecules (Pan2017Mice).

SCPEP1 has also been identified in studies related to endometrial cancer, where it was found to be uniquely associated with serous endometrial cancer, indicating a potential novel role in cancer biology (Konje2022Identification). Additionally, SCPEP1 is implicated in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which is significant in the context of epilepsy and focal cortical dysplasia, suggesting its involvement in cellular signaling networks (Wang2024Identification). These interactions highlight SCPEP1's potential regulatory roles in various biological processes.
