# TNFSF10

## Overview
The TNFSF10 gene encodes the protein TNF superfamily member 10, commonly known as TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand), which is a cytokine belonging to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily. TRAIL is primarily recognized for its role in inducing apoptosis in cancer cells, while sparing normal cells, through its interaction with specific death receptors on the cell surface (Guerrache2024TNF-Related). This protein is characterized by its ability to form a homotrimer, which is essential for its apoptotic function, and contains a TNF homology domain crucial for receptor binding (Kemter2005Molecular). Beyond apoptosis, TRAIL is involved in non-apoptotic signaling pathways, such as the activation of NF-κB, which can influence cell survival, inflammation, and immune responses (Guerrache2024TNF-Related). The protein's diverse roles in cellular processes make it a significant focus of research, particularly in the context of cancer therapy and neurodegenerative diseases (Cantarella2014Neutralization; Burgaletto2021Targeting).

## Structure
The TNFSF10 protein, also known as TRAIL, is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily and plays a crucial role in inducing apoptosis in cancer cells. The primary structure of the porcine TNFSF10 protein consists of 289 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of 33.5 kDa and a predicted isoelectric point (pI) of 8.15. It shares 86% similarity with the human TNFSF10 protein at the amino acid level (Kemter2005Molecular).

The secondary structure of TNFSF10 includes a TNF homology domain (THD), characterized by a beta jelly roll fold made of 10 beta strands, forming inner and outer beta sheets. This fold is conserved across the TNFL family, including TNFSF10, and is crucial for its function (Magis2012An).

In terms of quaternary structure, TNFSF10 typically forms a homotrimer, which is essential for its interaction with receptors. The protein's transmembrane region is located between amino acids 18-28, and a conserved domain for metal binding is present, with cysteine 230 as the putative zinc-binding amino acid, important for protein activity and trimerization (Kemter2005Molecular). 

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation can influence the stability and activity of TNFSF10. Splice variants may result in different isoforms with varying biological activities.

## Function
The TNFSF10 gene encodes the protein TRAIL, which is a member of the TNF superfamily and plays a significant role in inducing apoptosis, particularly in cancerous or infected cells, while sparing normal cells. TRAIL achieves this by binding to death receptors DR4 and DR5 on the cell surface, initiating a cascade that leads to programmed cell death through the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) and activation of caspases (Guerrache2024TNF-Related).

In healthy human cells, TRAIL is involved in maintaining tissue homeostasis and immune surveillance. It is expressed on the surface of immune cells and contributes to viral clearance and tumor immune surveillance by selectively inducing apoptosis in tumor cells (Guerrache2024TNF-Related). TRAIL also plays a role in non-apoptotic signaling pathways, such as the activation of the NF-κB pathway, which can lead to cell survival, inflammation, and immune response regulation (Guerrache2024TNF-Related).

TRAIL is active in the extracellular space and is involved in various physiological processes, including the regulation of immune responses, inflammation, and the maintenance of lymphocyte homeostasis (Guerrache2024TNF-Related). It also influences cell differentiation and proliferation in several cell types, such as endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells, contributing to angiogenesis and tissue repair (Guerrache2024TNF-Related).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TNFSF10 gene, also known as TRAIL, have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), TNFSF10 expression is crucial for apoptosis and antitumor immunity. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs13074711, located upstream of the TNFSF10 gene, has been associated with breast cancer susceptibility in Black women. This SNP affects TNFSF10 expression and influences the tumor microenvironment by regulating immune cell infiltration, which may impact the effectiveness of chemotherapy and immunotherapy (Han2022An).

In Alzheimer's disease, TNFSF10 is involved in amyloid-beta neurotoxicity. Studies using murine models have shown that neutralizing TNFSF10 can reduce neurodegeneration and inflammation, leading to improved cognitive function. This suggests that TNFSF10 plays a pathophysiological role in Alzheimer's disease, and its neutralization could be a potential therapeutic strategy (Cantarella2014Neutralization).

TNFSF10 is also implicated in retinal degenerative diseases associated with Alzheimer's disease. Inhibition of TNFSF10 in a mouse model reduced retinal inflammation and neurodegeneration, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target for managing age-related ocular diseases (Burgaletto2021Targeting).

## Interactions
TNFSF10, also known as TRAIL, is a cytokine that interacts with several receptors and proteins to regulate apoptosis and other cellular processes. It primarily binds to death receptors DR4 (TRAIL-R1, TNFRSF10A) and DR5 (TRAIL-R2, TNFRSF10B), initiating the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). This complex includes the recruitment of the Fas-associated death domain (FADD) and pro-caspase-8, leading to the activation of downstream caspases and apoptosis (Oh2021Regulation; He2012Attenuation).

TNFSF10 also interacts with decoy receptors TNFRSF10C (DcR1) and TNFRSF10D (DcR2), which inhibit apoptotic signaling by failing to transmit death signals (Tayyeb2019Insilico). In addition to its role in apoptosis, TNFSF10 can activate non-apoptotic pathways, such as NF-κB, JNK, and ERK, which are associated with cancer cell invasion and metastasis (Oh2021Regulation).

The protein also engages in interactions that induce autophagy, a process that can protect cancer cells from apoptosis. This is mediated by MAPK8 activation through TRAF2 and RIPK1, which are crucial for TNFSF10-induced autophagy (He2012Attenuation). These interactions highlight the dual role of TNFSF10 in promoting both cell death and survival, depending on the cellular context.
