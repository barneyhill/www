# ALPK3

## Overview
The ALPK3 gene encodes the protein alpha kinase 3, which is a member of the atypical kinase family characterized by its unique alpha-type protein kinase domain. This protein plays a critical role in the structural and functional integrity of the sarcomere, particularly within cardiomyocytes, where it is localized to the M-band. Alpha kinase 3 is involved in the phosphorylation of sarcomeric proteins, contributing to muscle contractility and cardiac function. It interacts with key proteins such as SQSTM1 and MURF2, which are essential for protein quality control and mechanosensitive signaling in cardiac muscle. Mutations in the ALPK3 gene are linked to various forms of cardiomyopathy, highlighting its clinical significance in cardiac health (McNamara2022Alpha; Phelan2016ALPK3deficient).

## Structure
The ALPK3 protein is composed of 1907 amino acids and includes several key structural domains. It contains an alpha-type protein kinase domain and two immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domains, which are part of a superfamily involved in cell recognition (Çağlayan2017ALPK3; Li2023A). The alpha-kinase domain is an atypical protein kinase catalytic domain that recognizes protein sequences adopting an alpha-helical conformation (Li2023A). This domain is located at the extreme C-terminus of the protein and is well conserved between ALPK2 and ALPK3 (Middelbeek2009The).

The tertiary structure of ALPK3 involves a unique mode of substrate recognition, although the specific determinants for substrate recognition are not fully understood (Middelbeek2009The). The protein localizes to the M-band of the sarcomere in striated muscle, where it plays a role in maintaining sarcomere integrity and proteostasis (McNamara2022Alpha). ALPK3 interacts with M-band components, including Obscurin and the ubiquitin-binding protein SQSTM1, which are crucial for protein quality control (McNamara2022Alpha).

The protein's expression is restricted to the fetal and adult heart and adult skeletal muscle, suggesting its importance in cardiac and muscle function (Middelbeek2009The). However, detailed information on the quaternary structure, specific post-translational modifications, and splice variant isoforms of ALPK3 is not provided in the available context.

## Function
The ALPK3 gene encodes alpha kinase 3, a myogenic kinase that plays a crucial role in maintaining sarcomere integrity and proteostasis in striated muscle, particularly within cardiomyocytes. ALPK3 is localized to the M-band of the sarcomere, where it is involved in the phosphorylation of key sarcomeric proteins, contributing to proper sarcomere organization and function (McNamara2022Alpha). This kinase is essential for calcium handling and force generation in cardiomyocytes, which are critical for cardiac contraction and overall heart function (McNamara2022Alpha).

ALPK3 interacts with proteins such as SQSTM1 and MURF2, which are involved in mechanosensitive signaling and protein turnover, ensuring efficient protein quality control mechanisms in cardiomyocytes (McNamara2022Alpha). The gene's activity is crucial for the phospho-regulation of cytoskeletal proteins, maintaining sarcomere organization and muscle contractility (McNamara2022Alpha). ALPK3's function is vital for cardiac health, as its deficiency leads to disrupted sarcomeric organization and abnormal M-band localization of proteins, contributing to cardiomyopathy (McNamara2022Alpha; Phelan2016ALPK3deficient).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ALPK3 gene are associated with various forms of cardiomyopathy, a disease affecting the heart muscle. Truncating variants in ALPK3 have been identified as a cause of autosomal dominant hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), characterized by extensive myocardial fibrosis and progression to heart failure. These variants are linked to a severe cardiac phenotype with a high prevalence of apical and concentric patterns of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and a low prevalence of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (Lopes2021Alphaprotein).

Biallelic damaging variants in ALPK3, either homozygous or compound heterozygous, are associated with pediatric-onset cardiomyopathy, often presenting initially as dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) that transitions to ventricular hypertrophy. This progression is rapid and can lead to severe outcomes, including cardiac transplantation or death (Herkert2020Expanding). ALPK3-deficient cardiomyocytes exhibit disordered sarcomeres and intercalated discs, as well as abnormal calcium handling, which are indicative of the underlying genetic mechanism causing familial cardiomyopathy (Phelan2016ALPK3deficient).

Extracardiac manifestations, such as craniofacial and musculoskeletal abnormalities, are also observed in patients with biallelic ALPK3 variants, although these are not consistent enough to form a recognizable syndrome (Herkert2020Expanding). The expression of ALPK3 in skeletal and heart muscle, as well as its role in embryonic development, may explain these phenotypes (Herkert2020Expanding).

## Interactions
ALPK3 (alpha kinase 3) is involved in several critical interactions within cardiomyocytes, particularly at the M-band of the sarcomere. It binds to SQSTM1 (p62), a ubiquitin-binding protein, and is essential for the proper localization of SQSTM1 within the sarcomere. This interaction is crucial for maintaining sarcomere integrity and proteostasis, as ALPK3 deficiency disrupts the sarcomeric organization and protein quality control pathways (McNamara2022Alpha).

ALPK3 also interacts with other M-band proteins, including obscurin (OBSCN), obscurin-like protein (OBSL1), and the E3 ligase MURF2 (TRIM55). These interactions are vital for the M-band localization of SQSTM1 and are linked to ALPK3-related hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) (McNamara2022Alpha). The absence of the M-band marker MYOM1 in ALPK3 mutant cardiomyocytes further underscores the importance of these interactions for M-band integrity (McNamara2022Alpha).

ALPK3 is also involved in phosphorylation processes, influencing the phosphorylation of sarcomeric proteins and protein quality control pathways. This role highlights its function as a regulatory kinase controlling cardiac contraction through phosphorylation of sarcomeric proteins (McNamara2022Alpha).
