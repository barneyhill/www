# TRAPPC2L

## Overview
TRAPPC2L is a gene that encodes the trafficking protein particle complex subunit 2L, a crucial component of the TRAPP (transport protein particle) complex involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking. The TRAPP complex, which exists in multiple forms such as TRAPPII and TRAPPIII, plays a significant role in various stages of the secretory pathway, including ER-to-Golgi transport and autophagy. TRAPPC2L, specifically a subunit of the TRAPPII complex, is essential for maintaining the stability and function of this complex, facilitating proper membrane trafficking through interactions with other TRAPP subunits like TRAPPC10. It also plays a role in regulating Rab GTPases, which are vital for vesicle trafficking, by potentially influencing the substrate specificity of the TRAPPII complex's Rab-guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity. Mutations in TRAPPC2L have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its importance in cellular homeostasis and protein sorting (Zappa2019The; Rawlins2022Biallelic; Jenkins2020The).

## Function
TRAPPC2L is a component of the TRAPP complex, which is involved in vesicle-mediated transport within cells. In mammals, the TRAPP complex exists in two forms: TRAPPII and TRAPPIII. TRAPPII is primarily involved in late Golgi trafficking, while TRAPPIII plays a role in the early secretory pathway, specifically in ER-to-Golgi transport and autophagy (Zappa2019The). TRAPPC2L is a subunit of the TRAPPII complex and is implicated in maintaining the stability and function of this complex. It interacts with other TRAPP subunits, such as TRAPPC10, to facilitate proper membrane trafficking (Rawlins2022Biallelic).

TRAPPC2L is also involved in the regulation of Rab GTPases, which are critical for vesicle trafficking. It may influence the substrate specificity of the TRAPPII complex's Rab-guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity, suggesting a role in allosteric conformational changes within the complex (Jenkins2020The). The proper functioning of TRAPPC2L is essential for cellular homeostasis, as it impacts protein sorting and trafficking processes that are crucial for cell adaptation to environmental stress and overall cellular function (Zappa2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TRAPPC2L gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders. These disorders often present with developmental delays, severe expressive language delays, and other neurological symptoms. Specific mutations, such as the novel homozygous missense variant p.(Ala2Gly), have been identified in individuals from an Ashkenazi Jewish family, leading to disrupted interactions within the TRAPP complex and causing delays in membrane trafficking (Alderi2020A). Another variant, p.(Asp37Tyr), is linked to neurodevelopmental delay, seizures, post-infectious encephalopathy, and rhabdomyolysis (Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:; Alderi2020A).

These mutations affect the assembly and function of TRAPP complexes, which are crucial for vesicle fusion in membrane trafficking. The disruption in TRAPPC2L function can lead to a delay in ER-to-Golgi traffic and affect the levels of active RAB11, a GTPase involved in intracellular membrane trafficking (Alderi2020A). The clinical features of TRAPPC2L mutations share similarities with mutations in other TRAPP subunit genes, such as TRAPPC6A, TRAPPC6B, TRAPPC9, and TRAPPC11, which are associated with neurodevelopmental delays, microcephaly, seizures, and extrapyramidal symptoms (Alderi2020A). The variability in clinical outcomes may be due to differences in the molecular effects of the variants (Alderi2020A).

## Interactions
TRAPPC2L is a component of the TRAPP complex, which is involved in membrane trafficking processes. It interacts with various subunits of the TRAPP complex, including TRAPPC6a, TRAPPC10, and TRAPPC12. The p.(Ala2Gly) variant of TRAPPC2L disrupts its interaction with TRAPPC6a and TRAPPC12, but not with TRAPPC10, indicating its role as an adaptor protein that aids in the assembly of TRAPP complexes (Alderi2020A). The p.(Asp37Tyr) variant, on the other hand, disrupts the interaction with TRAPPC10, affecting Golgi protein trafficking and Rab11 localization (Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:).

TRAPPC2L is also involved in the regulation of Rab11, a GTPase associated with membrane trafficking. The altered activity of Rab11 due to TRAPPC2L variants suggests that TRAPPC2L may regulate the GEF activity of TRAPP for Rab11 or participate in recruiting a Rab11 GAP (Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:). The interaction dynamics of TRAPPC2L with other proteins were studied using in vitro binding assays, which examined the binding affinity between TRAPPC2L variants and a His6-tagged heterodimeric complex composed of TRAPPC3 and TRAPPC6a (Alderi2020A). These interactions are crucial for understanding the role of TRAPPC2L in neurodevelopmental disorders associated with its variants.
