# ITPRIP

## Overview
The ITPRIP gene encodes the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor-interacting protein, a crucial modulator of intracellular calcium signaling. This protein interacts with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) on the endoplasmic reticulum, influencing calcium release and playing a significant role in various cellular processes, including muscle contraction, secretion, and cell growth (Simino2017Whole). ITPRIP is categorized as a regulatory protein due to its involvement in modulating the activity of IP3Rs and its interactions with other proteins such as death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) and myosin regulatory light polypeptide 9 (MYL9), which are critical in cellular signaling pathways (Cao2021ITPRIP). The protein's functions extend to influencing synaptic plasticity and amyloid-beta concentrations, with potential implications in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (Simino2017Whole). Additionally, ITPRIP has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly in glioma progression and hepatocellular carcinoma prognosis, highlighting its broader significance in human health (Yan2023Development; Cao2021ITPRIP).

## Function
The ITPRIP gene encodes a protein that interacts with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) on the endoplasmic reticulum, playing a crucial role in modulating calcium signaling within cells. This interaction is significant as it allosterically downregulates IP3-induced calcium release, which is essential for various cellular processes such as muscle contraction, secretion, and cell growth (Simino2017Whole). ITPRIP is localized to the outer nuclear membrane and is concentrated at the nuclear envelope, suggesting a role in localized regulation of calcium fluxes near the nucleus (Cheng2019Identification).

The protein's function extends to influencing synaptic plasticity and amyloid-beta concentrations, potentially impacting neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's disease. ITPRIP's interaction with IP3R is a pathway that may modulate plasma amyloid-beta levels, which are linked to synaptic function and plasticity (Simino2017Whole). Additionally, ITPRIP is involved in cell death signaling pathways by binding and inhibiting death-associated protein kinase, which is crucial for maintaining cellular health and preventing neurodegenerative diseases (Simino2017Whole). These roles highlight ITPRIP's importance in cellular calcium signaling and its broader implications in human health.

## Clinical Significance
The ITPRIP gene is implicated in the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) when undergoing immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment. It is part of a risk model that evaluates tumor microenvironment heterogeneity, with its expression linked to immune infiltration and tumor purity. The TMErisk model, which includes ITPRIP, categorizes HCC patients into high-risk and low-risk groups, influencing treatment decisions and potentially guiding the use of alternative therapies like tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Yan2023Development).

In the context of neurological disorders, ITPRIP interacts with neuroligin 3 (NLGN3) and the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R), affecting calcium signaling dynamics. This interaction suggests a role in neuronal plasticity, although no direct clinical significance of ITPRIP mutations or expression changes in neurodevelopmental disorders has been established (Shen2014Novel).

While ITPRIP's role in other diseases is not extensively documented, its involvement in calcium signaling pathways indicates potential implications in conditions where calcium homeostasis is disrupted. However, specific diseases resulting directly from ITPRIP mutations or expression alterations remain to be fully elucidated.

## Interactions
ITPRIP, also known as inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor-interacting protein, is involved in several protein interactions that play a significant role in glioma progression. It interacts with death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) and myosin regulatory light polypeptide 9 (MYL9) in glioma cells, forming a ternary complex crucial for glioma cell behavior (Cao2021ITPRIP). ITPRIP binds directly to DAPK1, inhibiting its activity towards MYL9, which impedes DAPK1's role in promoting cell death and preventing oncogenic transformation (Cao2021ITPRIP). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments have demonstrated that ITPRIP interacts with endogenous DAPK1 and MYL9 in glioma cell lines such as U251 and U87 (Cao2021ITPRIP).

The interaction between ITPRIP and DAPK1 is dependent on the death domain (DD) of DAPK1, which is necessary for their binding. Disrupting this interaction has been shown to suppress glioma progression, highlighting the importance of the DD in this context (Cao2021ITPRIP). ITPRIP also plays a role in recruiting MYL9 to DAPK1 and is involved in the phosphorylation of MYL9, potentially independently of DAPK1 (Cao2021ITPRIP). These interactions suggest that ITPRIP is a key modulator in the signaling pathways associated with glioma progression.
