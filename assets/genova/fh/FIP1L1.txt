# FIP1L1

## Overview
FIP1L1 is a human gene that encodes a protein component of the Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specificity Factor (CPSF) complex, which is integral to the 3' end processing of pre-mRNA. The protein, known as hFip1, is characterized by its role in RNA binding and polyadenylation stimulation, facilitated by its interaction with other proteins such as Poly(A) Polymerase (PAPOLA) and CPSF1. This interaction is crucial for the maturation and stability of mRNA, thereby influencing gene expression. In addition to its normal cellular functions, FIP1L1 is clinically significant due to its involvement in the formation of the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene, which is associated with certain myeloid neoplasms, including chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL) and hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES). This fusion results in the constitutive activation of the PDGFRA kinase domain, contributing to the pathogenesis of these disorders (Cools2004The; Toffalini2009The). The FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion protein is a target for tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib, which are used in the treatment of these conditions (Reiter2017Myeloid).

## Structure
The human FIP1L1 gene encodes a protein that is a subunit of the Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specificity Factor (CPSF) complex, involved in pre-mRNA 3' end processing. The protein, known as hFip1, consists of 594 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 66 kDa (Kaufmann2004Human). It features an acidic N-terminus, a conserved central region, and a proline-rich domain. The C-terminal region contains an arginine-rich domain with RNA-binding motifs, crucial for its function in RNA binding and polyadenylation stimulation (Kaufmann2004Human).

hFip1 interacts with several proteins, including Poly(A) Polymerase (PAP), CPSF30, CPSF160, and CstF77, forming a ternary complex with PAP and CPSF160 (Kaufmann2004Human). The protein's C-terminal domain is essential for stimulating PAP activity, even in the absence of the canonical AAUAAA signal (Kaufmann2004Human).

Post-translational modifications of hFip1 include phosphorylation, with sites located in the acidic N-terminal and arginine-rich C-terminal regions (Ryan2008Finishing). Alternative splicing of the FIP1L1 gene results in different isoforms, contributing to the protein's size heterogeneity (Kaufmann2004Human).

## Function
FIP1L1 is a component of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex, which plays a crucial role in the 3' end processing of pre-mRNA. This process is essential for the maturation, stability, and export of mRNA from the nucleus, thereby facilitating proper gene expression and regulation in healthy human cells. FIP1L1 interacts with poly(A) polymerase (PAPOLA) and CPSF1, aiding in the addition of poly(A) tails to mRNA, a key step in mRNA maturation.

In the context of hematopoietic cells, FIP1L1, when fused with PDGFRA due to a chromosomal deletion, is implicated in the pathogenesis of certain myeloid neoplasms, such as chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL) and hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES). The FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion protein results in constitutive activation of the PDGFRA kinase domain, which is not typical of the FIP1L1 protein's function in healthy cells (Cools2004The; Toffalini2009The). This fusion protein is associated with increased proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells, particularly affecting the eosinophil lineage (MontanoAlmendras2012ETV6PDGFRB). However, these pathological roles are distinct from the normal cellular functions of FIP1L1.

## Clinical Significance
The FIP1L1 gene is clinically significant due to its involvement in the formation of the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene, which is associated with myeloid neoplasms with eosinophilia, such as chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL) and hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) (Reiter2017Myeloid). This fusion results from an interstitial deletion on chromosome 4q12, leading to the constitutive activation of the PDGFRA tyrosine kinase, which contributes to the pathogenesis of these disorders (Loules2009FIP1L1PDGFRA). Patients with this fusion gene often present with marked eosinophilia and related end-organ damage, including tissue fibrosis (Klion2007Relapse).

The presence of the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene is a predictor of a favorable response to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate, which can induce rapid hematologic and molecular remissions (Jovanovic2007Lowdose; Reiter2017Myeloid). However, resistance to imatinib can occur, often due to mutations like T674I in the PDGFRA kinase domain, which necessitates the use of alternative tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as nilotinib or ponatinib (Demoulin2013Review; von2006The). The FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion is predominantly found in male patients, though the reason for this gender bias is not well understood (Shomali2021World).

## Interactions
FIP1L1 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It is a component of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex, where it interacts with PAPOLA (poly(A) polymerase alpha) and CPSF1, contributing to mRNA processing, particularly in polyadenylation.

In the context of leukemia, FIP1L1 forms a fusion protein with PDGFRA, known as FIP1L1-PDGFRA, which is implicated in chronic eosinophilic leukemia. This fusion protein interacts with the small ubiquitin-like modifier E3 ligase PIAS1. FIP1L1-PDGFRA phosphorylates PIAS1 on tyrosine residues, enhancing its stability. Conversely, PIAS1 sumoylates and stabilizes FIP1L1-PDGFRA, indicating a positive cross-talk between these proteins through their enzymatic activities (Ibata2017Leukemogenic).

FIP1L1-PDGFRA also interacts with the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2. This interaction is crucial for the activation of signaling pathways such as ERK, which are important for cell proliferation. The Y720 residue of FIP1L1-PDGFRA is essential for binding SHP2, and mutations at this site significantly reduce the oncogenic activity of the fusion protein (Noël2014The). These interactions highlight the role of FIP1L1 in both normal cellular functions and pathological conditions.
