# PSMA1

## Overview
PSMA1 is a gene that encodes the proteasome 20S subunit alpha 1, a critical component of the 20S core particle of the proteasome complex. This protein is categorized as a proteasome subunit and plays a pivotal role in the proteolytic degradation of proteins within the cell. The proteasome is a large, cylindrical complex responsible for degrading oxidized, misfolded, or damaged proteins, thereby maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression and stress responses. The PSMA1 subunit is part of the alpha ring structure of the proteasome, which functions as a gatekeeper, controlling the entry of substrates into the catalytic core. This regulation is essential for the proteasome's role in cellular stress adaptation and aging (Raynes2016Degradation). PSMA1 is highly conserved across species, indicating its fundamental role in cellular biology (Elenich1999The).

## Structure
The PSMA1 gene encodes the proteasome 20S subunit alpha 1, a component of the 20S core particle of the proteasome complex. The primary structure of PSMA1 consists of 263 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 29,500 Da and an isoelectric point of 6.42 (Elenich1999The). The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stable and compact tertiary structure. PSMA1 is part of the alpha ring in the quaternary structure of the proteasome, which is composed of four stacked heptameric rings, forming a cylindrical core (Elenich1999The; TANAKA2009The).

The PSMA1 subunit is involved in the gatekeeping function of the proteasome, controlling the entry of substrates into the catalytic core. It is homologous to the shorter human isoform and conserved across species such as rat, Drosophila, and Arabidopsis (Elenich1999The). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur, although specific modifications for PSMA1 are not detailed in the provided context. No evidence of alternatively spliced mRNA variants for PSMA1 was found in the EST database (Elenich1999The).

## Function
The PSMA1 gene encodes a subunit of the 20S proteasome, a core component of the proteasomal system in mammals. The 20S proteasome is a cylindrical complex composed of four heptameric rings, with the outer rings made of α-subunits, including PSMA1, and the inner rings of β-subunits. This structure forms a catalytic chamber responsible for proteolytic activity, which includes trypsin-like, chymotrypsin-like, and peptidyl-glutamyl peptide hydrolyzing activities (Raynes2016Degradation; Kopp1997Subunit).

In healthy human cells, the 20S proteasome is involved in the degradation of oxidized and misfolded proteins, particularly during oxidative stress, operating independently of ATP and ubiquitin. This function is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and stress responses (Raynes2016Degradation). The 20S proteasome is abundant in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it ensures proper protein turnover and cellular function (Raynes2016Degradation).

The α-rings, including the PSMA1 subunit, play a role in substrate binding and translocation into the catalytic cavity, regulating the entry of proteins for degradation (Raynes2016Degradation). This regulation is essential for the proteasome's role in cellular stress adaptation and aging (Raynes2016Degradation).

## Clinical Significance
PSMA1, a component of the 20S core proteasome complex, has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In gastric carcinoma (GC), PSMA1 is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis. It promotes tumor progression by stabilizing the transcriptional co-activator TAZ, which is involved in cell proliferation and migration. This stabilization occurs through the inhibition of TAZ ubiquitination, enhancing its oncogenic activity in GC (Yang2022PSMA1). High PSMA1 expression correlates with increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in GC, suggesting its role as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Yang2022PSMA1).

In a broader cancer context, PSMA1 is overexpressed in multiple cancer types, influencing overall survival and progression-free intervals. Its high expression is linked to decreased survival in a significant number of cancer types, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker (Larsson2022Pancancer). In breast cancer, PSMA1 is also overexpressed and associated with poor survival outcomes, indicating its involvement in cancer development and progression (Chiao2021Prognostic). These findings underscore the clinical significance of PSMA1 expression alterations in cancer prognosis and therapy.

## Interactions
PSMA1, a component of the 20S proteasome core particle, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) MDHDH, which acts as a scaffold to promote the degradation of the protein MDH2. This interaction enhances the binding of ubiquitinated MDH2 to PSMA1, facilitating its degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) (He2022A). In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), MDHDH regulates NAD+ metabolism and autophagy by modulating the interaction between MDH2 and PSMA1 (He2022A).

In gastric carcinoma (GC), PSMA1 interacts with the TAZ protein, a downstream effector of the Hippo pathway. PSMA1 stabilizes TAZ by deubiquitinating it, preventing its degradation via the proteasome pathway. This interaction is crucial for maintaining TAZ stability, promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in GC cells (Yang2022PSMA1). The PSMA1-TAZ interaction is significant in GC progression, with PSMA1 serving as a potential therapeutic target due to its role in stabilizing TAZ and promoting oncogenic activity (Yang2022PSMA1).
