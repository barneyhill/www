# KRT23

## Overview
Keratin 23 (KRT23) is a gene that encodes the protein keratin 23, a type I acidic keratin, which is a member of the cytoskeletal protein family. This protein is primarily involved in maintaining the structural integrity and mechanical resilience of epithelial cells, playing a crucial role in cellular processes such as differentiation, proliferation, and stress response (Guldiken2016Keratin; Liffers2011Keratin). Keratin 23 is characterized by a central alpha-helical rod domain, which is a common feature among keratins, providing structural support to epithelial tissues (BirkenkampDemtroder2007Phosphoprotein). The protein interacts with various cellular components, including 14-3-3 proteins and plectin, indicating its involvement in signal transduction and maintaining cell-to-cell junctions (Liffers2011Keratin). KRT23 has been implicated in several cancers, such as gastric and colorectal cancers, where its expression levels are altered, suggesting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Li2023Loss; BirkenkampDemtroder2007Phosphoprotein).

## Structure
Keratin 23 (KRT23) is a type I cytokeratin characterized by a central alpha-helical rod domain, which is a common feature among keratins, providing structural integrity to epithelial cells (BirkenkampDemtroder2007Phosphoprotein). This rod domain is highly conserved and consists of four segments connected by linkers of variable length (BirkenkampDemtroder2007Phosphoprotein). The head and tail regions of KRT23 are more divergent compared to other type I keratins (BirkenkampDemtroder2007Phosphoprotein).

KRT23 exists in different isoforms, likely due to alternative splicing, with molecular weights of approximately 47 kDa and a potential 55 kDa isoform (BirkenkampDemtroder2007Phosphoprotein). The 47 kDa isoform is predominantly found in the cytoskeletal fraction, while the 55 kDa isoform is present in the cytosolic fraction (BirkenkampDemtroder2007Phosphoprotein).

Post-translational modifications of KRT23 include serine phosphorylation, suggesting it is a target for serine kinases, which may play a role in cellular processes such as mitosis (BirkenkampDemtroder2007Phosphoprotein). The protein is resistant to caspase-3 cleavage due to a specific amino acid substitution, distinguishing it from other keratins like K18 (BirkenkampDemtroder2007Phosphoprotein).

## Function
Keratin 23 (KRT23) is a type I acidic keratin that plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity and mechanical resilience of epithelial cells. It is primarily active in the cytoskeleton, where it contributes to cell stability and tissue organization (Liffers2011Keratin). KRT23 is involved in cellular processes such as differentiation and proliferation, and it is implicated in cellular responses to stress (Guldiken2016Keratin).

In healthy human cells, KRT23 interacts with various proteins, including 14-3-3ε, a protein involved in signal transduction and cellular localization. This interaction is Smad4-dependent, suggesting that KRT23 may influence the cellular distribution of 14-3-3ε, potentially affecting its function in signal transduction pathways (Liffers2011Keratin). KRT23 is also associated with the cytoskeletal linker protein plectin, indicating its involvement in maintaining cell-to-cell junctions through desmosomes and hemidesmosomes, which contribute to the epithelial phenotype (Liffers2011Keratin).

The localization of KRT23 is primarily cytoplasmic, surrounding the nucleus and forming a characteristic filamentous structure typical of keratin proteins (Liffers2011Keratin). This structural role is crucial for the mechanical properties of epithelial cells, influencing their ability to withstand stress and maintain proper function.

## Clinical Significance
KRT23 (keratin 23) has been implicated in various cancers, notably gastric and colorectal cancers, due to alterations in its expression levels. In gastric cancer, KRT23 is highly expressed in cancerous cells compared to normal gastric epithelial cells. Its knockout enhances the inhibitory effects of melatonin on gastric cancer cells, reducing cell proliferation and altering cell cycle progression through the inhibition of p38/ERK phosphorylation pathways. This suggests that KRT23 could be a potential drug target and prognostic factor in gastric cancer (Li2023Loss).

In colorectal cancer, KRT23 shows differential expression in microsatellite stable (MSS) versus microsatellite instability (MSI) tumors. It is significantly upregulated in MSS tumors, where it may play a role in tumor viability and proliferation. KRT23 expression is associated with a protective function in MSI tumors by inducing cell death, while MSS tumors may escape this effect due to defective cellular control mechanisms. This differential expression suggests that KRT23 could serve as a biomarker for distinguishing between MSS and MSI colon cancers and may have implications for prognosis and treatment response (BirkenkampDemtroder2007Phosphoprotein).

No disease-associated mutations have been reported for KRT23, but its expression and interactions are significant in the context of cancer (Omary2009Toward).

## Interactions
Keratin 23 (KRT23) is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. KRT23 interacts with the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) promoter, enhancing hTERT expression, which is crucial for colorectal cancer cell proliferation and migration (Zhang2017Keratin). It also interacts with proteins such as 14-3-3ε and 14-3-3γ, which are involved in signal transduction, cell cycle control, and apoptosis. This interaction is Smad4-dependent, leading to the cytoplasmic sequestration of 14-3-3ε, thereby altering its functional status (Liffers2011Keratin).

KRT23 is also known to bind with other keratins, such as KRT8 and KRT18, and heat shock proteins HSP60 and HSP70, suggesting its role in forming multiprotein complexes that contribute to cellular structural integrity and stress response (Liffers2011Keratin). In hepatocellular carcinoma, KRT23 interacts with the protein P21 (CDKN1A), modulating the PI3K/AKT/GSK3β signaling pathway, which is important for cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (Guo2020KRT23). These interactions highlight KRT23's involvement in both structural and signaling roles within the cell.
