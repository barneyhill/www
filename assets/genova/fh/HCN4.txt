# HCN4

## Overview
HCN4 is a gene that encodes the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated potassium channel 4, a transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in cardiac and neuronal physiology. This protein is a member of the HCN channel family, which is characterized by its activation through hyperpolarization and modulation by cyclic nucleotides such as cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) (Stieber2003Molecular; WahlSchott2008HCN). HCN4 channels are integral to the generation of the 'funny' current (I_f) in the sinoatrial node of the heart, contributing to the regulation of heart rate by facilitating the diastolic depolarization phase of the cardiac action potential (Verkerk2015Pacemaker; Hoekstra2021HCN4). The protein's structure includes a cyclic nucleotide-binding domain (CNBD) that allows for cAMP-dependent regulation, which is crucial for its function in the autonomic nervous system (Hennis2021Speeding). Mutations in the HCN4 gene have been linked to various cardiac and neurological disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Nof2007Point; Campostrini2018A).

## Structure
The HCN4 protein is a member of the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel family, characterized by its unique activation by hyperpolarization and regulation by cyclic nucleotides such as cAMP. The protein is a tetramer, with each subunit containing six transmembrane segments (S1-S6) and a pore loop between S5 and S6, similar to voltage-gated potassium channels. The S4 segment acts as a voltage sensor due to its positively charged residues (Stieber2003Molecular; WahlSchott2008HCN).

The C-terminal domain of HCN4 includes a cyclic nucleotide-binding domain (CNBD) and a C-linker domain, which are crucial for the channel's regulation by cAMP. The CNBD is composed of about 120 amino acids and features an initial alpha-helix, an eight-stranded antiparallel beta-roll, a short B-helix, and a long C-helix (WahlSchott2008HCN). The binding of cAMP to the CNBD shifts the voltage-dependence of activation to more positive voltages and speeds up channel opening (Peters2022Regulation).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are important for the cell surface expression of HCN4. Tyrosine phosphorylation by kinases like Src also modulates the channel's activation kinetics (WahlSchott2008HCN). Alternative splicing has been reported, potentially increasing the diversity of HCN4 channel types (WahlSchott2008HCN).

## Function
The HCN4 gene encodes a protein that forms part of the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel family, which is crucial for generating the 'funny' current (I_f) in the sinoatrial node (SAN) of the heart. This current is essential for pacemaker activity, contributing to the regulation of heart rate by facilitating the diastolic depolarization phase of the cardiac action potential (Verkerk2015Pacemaker; Hoekstra2021HCN4). HCN4 channels are activated by hyperpolarization and modulated by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which binds to a cyclic nucleotide-binding domain (CNBD) in the channel's intracellular C-terminus. This cAMP-dependent regulation is tightly controlled by the autonomic nervous system (Hennis2021Speeding).

In healthy human cells, HCN4 is involved in setting the intrinsic heart rate, particularly the lower part of the heart rate range, and exerts a protective effect on the SAN network during parasympathetic activity, thereby suppressing bradycardia (Hennis2021Speeding). The HCN4 protein helps ensure a stable transition between different heart rates during sympathetic and/or vagal activity, particularly fine-tuning the heart rate-lowering effect of the parasympathetic nervous system (Hennis2021Speeding).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HCN4 gene are associated with a variety of cardiac and neurological conditions. In the cardiac context, HCN4 mutations can lead to sinus node dysfunction, bradycardia, and other arrhythmias. Specific mutations such as G480R and K530N have been linked to familial asymptomatic sinus bradycardia and tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome, respectively (Nof2007Point). The G480R mutation affects the synthesis and trafficking of HCN4 channels, resulting in reduced current density and altered activation patterns (Nof2007Point). The K530N mutation, found in a conserved region of the C-linker, is associated with atrial fibrillation and persistent tachyarrhythmias (Duhme2012Altered).

In the neurological domain, the R550C mutation in HCN4 is linked to familial benign myoclonic epilepsy in infancy. This mutation causes a leftward shift in the voltage dependence of HCN4 activation, increasing neuronal excitability and predisposing individuals to epilepsy (Campostrini2018A). The mutation involves a point change in the B' helix of the channel C-linker, replacing a positively charged arginine with a polar cysteine, which alters channel kinetics (Campostrini2018A). Despite its impact in infancy, the condition is generally benign and treatable in adulthood (Campostrini2018A).

## Interactions
HCN4 interacts with several proteins that modulate its function and localization. One significant interaction is with KCNE2, a regulatory beta-subunit. KCNE2 specifically modulates the current amplitudes and activation kinetics of HCN4, enhancing current amplitudes, slowing activation kinetics, and shifting the voltage for half-maximal activation to more negative voltages. This interaction is specific to KCNE2, as other KCNE family members do not affect HCN4 currents in the same way (Decher2003KCNE2).

HCN4 also interacts with caveolin proteins, particularly caveolin-1 (cav-1) and caveolin-3 (cav-3). These interactions are crucial for the functional modulation of HCN4 channels, affecting channel kinetics and trafficking to the plasma membrane. Mutations in the caveolin-binding domain (CBD) of HCN4 can impair these interactions, leading to altered channel function (Barbuti2012A).

Additionally, HCN4 interacts with SAP97, an adapter protein that modulates the surface expression of HCN channels. This interaction is dependent on the PDZ compatible binding motif at the C-terminus of HCN4, contributing to the specific organization of HCN channels within the sinoatrial node (Peters2009In).
