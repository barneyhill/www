# OR5M1

## Overview
The OR5M1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 5 subfamily M member 1, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein is involved in the detection of odorant molecules, playing a crucial role in the olfactory system by initiating neuronal responses that lead to the perception of smell. As a transmembrane receptor, it spans the cell membrane and transduces extracellular signals through the activation of intracellular G-proteins. The olfactory receptor family is one of the largest gene families in the human genome, and OR5M1 is one of many receptors that contribute to the diversity and specificity of olfactory perception (Qiu2020aarFDC).
