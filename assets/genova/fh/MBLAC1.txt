# MBLAC1

## Overview
MBLAC1 is a gene that encodes the protein metallo-beta-lactamase domain containing 1, which is a member of the metallo-β-lactamase (MBL) superfamily. This protein is characterized by its metallo-β-lactamase domain, which binds metal ions, typically zinc, and is essential for its enzymatic activity (Bahr2021Metallo-β-lactamases; Retzlaff2017Metalloβlactamase). MBLAC1 plays a crucial role in the processing of replication-dependent histone pre-mRNA during the S-phase of the cell cycle, functioning as an endoribonuclease (Pettinati2018Biosynthesis). Additionally, it is involved in various metabolic pathways, including taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, and is implicated in the regulation of extracellular glutamate homeostasis in the central nervous system (Retzlaff2017Metalloβlactamase; Gibson2018Global). The protein's interaction with the antibiotic ceftriaxone suggests a potential role in neurological conditions, highlighting its clinical significance in neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders (Retzlaff2017Metalloβlactamase; Ceyhan2023Optical).

## Structure
The MBLAC1 protein contains a metallo-β-lactamase domain (MBD), which is characterized by its ability to bind metal ions, typically zinc, essential for its enzymatic activity (Retzlaff2017Metalloβlactamase). This domain includes conserved residues such as histidine and aspartate, which are crucial for metal binding and catalysis (Retzlaff2017Metalloβlactamase). The protein is part of the metallo-β-lactamase (MBL) superfamily, which shares a conserved αβ/βα fold and a metal binding site (Bahr2021Metallo-β-lactamases). 

MBLAC1 is a human ortholog of the C. elegans gene swip-10 and is involved in glial regulation of extracellular glutamate homeostasis (Retzlaff2017Metalloβlactamase). Although the specific molecular structure of MBLAC1 is not detailed in the available excerpts, it is suggested to have a typical β-lactamase fold, which includes a mixed alpha/beta structure (Pettinati2016The). The protein's structure allows it to interact with the antibiotic ceftriaxone, indicating a potential role in the central nervous system (Retzlaff2017Metalloβlactamase). The exact post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms of MBLAC1 are not specified in the provided context.

## Function
MBLAC1 (metallo-beta-lactamase domain containing 1) is a protein involved in the processing of replication-dependent (RD) histone pre-mRNA during the S-phase of the cell cycle. It functions as an endoribonuclease, selectively cleaving histone pre-mRNA at specific sites, particularly after the CA dinucleotide located downstream of the stem-loop structure. This activity is crucial for the maturation of histone pre-mRNA, which is necessary for the production of histone proteins and normal cell cycle progression (Pettinati2018Biosynthesis).

MBLAC1 is implicated in cell cycle regulation, particularly during the S-phase, and is involved in histone biosynthesis. Depletion of MBLAC1 results in a cell cycle defect, characterized by an increased accumulation of cells in the G1/early S-phase and a decreased proportion of cells in the G2 phase. This suggests that MBLAC1 is important for normal cell cycle progression (Pettinati2018Biosynthesis).

In addition to its role in RNA processing, MBLAC1 is involved in metabolic pathways, including taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, primary bile acid biosynthesis, and linoleate metabolism. The loss of MBLAC1 expression disrupts these pathways, indicating its functional importance in maintaining metabolic balance in healthy human cells (Gibson2018Global).

## Clinical Significance
The MBLAC1 gene has been implicated in several neurodegenerative and metabolic conditions. Alterations in MBLAC1 expression are associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, particularly in individuals with cardiovascular comorbidities. This suggests that reduced MBLAC1 protein expression may lead to broader metabolic alterations, potentially contributing to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (Ceyhan2023Optical). Studies using Mblac1 knockout mice have shown a more oxidized redox state in liver tissues, indicating potential mitochondrial dysfunction, which is characterized by a significant decrease in the redox ratio due to lower NADH levels. This suggests deficits in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and diminished ATP production, which could support neurodegeneration and peripheral comorbidities (Ceyhan2023Optical).

MBLAC1 is also identified as a high-affinity target for the antibiotic ceftriaxone, which is known to elevate the expression of the glutamate transporter GLT-1. This interaction suggests a role for MBLAC1 in glial regulation of extracellular glutamate homeostasis, potentially linking it to glutamate-related neurological conditions such as stroke, epilepsy, and Parkinson's disease (Retzlaff2017Metalloβlactamase). The loss of MBLAC1 expression affects metabolic pathways, including taurine and linoleate metabolism, which are crucial for brain function and protection against oxidative stress (Gibson2018Global).

## Interactions
MBLAC1, a protein encoded by the human gene MBLAC1, is known to interact specifically with the β-lactam antibiotic ceftriaxone (Cef). This interaction is characterized by high affinity and specificity, as demonstrated through various experimental approaches, including backscattering interferometry and pulldown assays. These studies have shown that Cef binds to MBLAC1 with a dissociation constant (K_D) of 2.2 µM, indicating a strong interaction (Retzlaff2017Metalloβlactamase). The interaction between MBLAC1 and Cef is significant because it suggests a potential role for MBLAC1 in modulating glutamate transporter expression, particularly GLT-1, in the central nervous system (Retzlaff2017Metalloβlactamase).

While MBLAC1 is part of the metallo-β-lactamase superfamily, which includes proteins that often participate in various biochemical processes, specific interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids have not been detailed in the available literature. The protein's role in forming multiprotein complexes or engaging in regulatory activities remains to be fully elucidated. Further research is needed to identify any additional endogenous substrates or interaction partners of MBLAC1 (Pettinati2016The).
