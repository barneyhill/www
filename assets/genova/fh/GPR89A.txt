# GPR89A

## Overview
GPR89A is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 89A, a transmembrane protein that functions as a voltage-dependent anion channel. This protein is primarily located in the Golgi apparatus, where it plays a critical role in maintaining the acidic environment necessary for proper protein trafficking and processing. The acidic conditions facilitated by GPR89A are essential for enzyme activation and protein cleavage, impacting cellular homeostasis and development (Deckstein2015The; Maeda2008GPHR). Beyond its role in the Golgi, GPR89A is involved in broader cellular processes, such as lysosomal pH regulation and transferrin recycling, underscoring its importance in cellular homeostasis (Maeda2008GPHR). The protein's function is conserved across species, highlighting its fundamental role in cellular biology (Maeda2008GPHR).

## Function
GPR89A, also known as G protein-coupled receptor 89A, functions as a voltage-dependent anion channel primarily located in the Golgi apparatus. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the acidic environment of the Golgi, which is essential for proper protein trafficking and processing. This acidic environment is necessary for the activation of enzymes and the efficient cleavage of proteins, impacting cellular homeostasis and organismal development (Deckstein2015The; Maeda2008GPHR).

The protein is involved in intracellular pH regulation, which is vital for the Golgi apparatus's function in protein processing and trafficking within the cell (Maeda2008GPHR). GPR89A's role in maintaining Golgi pH is critical for the proper functioning of the secretory pathway, influencing processes such as glycosylation and protein transport (Deckstein2015The).

In addition to its role in the Golgi, GPR89A is associated with broader cellular processes, including the regulation of lysosomal pH and the recycling of transferrin, indicating its involvement in cellular homeostasis (Maeda2008GPHR). The protein's function is conserved across species, highlighting its fundamental role in cellular biology (Maeda2008GPHR).

## Clinical Significance
GPR89A has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in cellular signaling. In the context of aggressive digital papillary adenocarcinoma (ADPA), a rare sweat gland carcinoma, GPR89A is involved in the pH regulation of the Golgi apparatus. Its knockdown has been associated with Golgi dysfunction and increased apoptosis, suggesting a potential role in cancer susceptibility (Surowy2019Gene). The gene has also been identified as a susceptibility gene in breast cancer, although the study notes the limited power of their sample set and the need for further research to validate these findings (Surowy2019Gene).

In neurodevelopment, GPR89A, along with its paralog GPR89B, is affected by genomic alterations at the chromosome 1q21.1 hotspot, which are associated with conditions such as microcephaly and macrocephaly in children with neurocognitive disabilities. These alterations suggest that GPR89A may play a role in brain size and cognitive functions, potentially contributing to neurodevelopmental disorders (Soto2024Gene).

In hematopoietic cells, GPR89A is identified as an effector for the RAS family member RABL3, and its interactions are crucial for oncogenic growth, indicating its potential involvement in hematological malignancies (Peiris2022Proteomic).
