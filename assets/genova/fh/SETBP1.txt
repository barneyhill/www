# SETBP1

## Overview
SETBP1 is a gene that encodes the SET binding protein 1, a transcription factor involved in various cellular processes, including DNA replication and transcriptional regulation. The protein is characterized by its AT-hook domains, which enable it to bind to AT-rich regions of genomic DNA, facilitating the recruitment of epigenetic complexes essential for chromatin remodeling and transcriptional activation (Piazza2018SETBP1). SET binding protein 1 plays a crucial role in the regulation of genes associated with development, particularly in the nervous system, heart, and bone, and is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis and identity (Banfi2021SETBP1). The protein's interactions with other transcriptional regulators underscore its function as an epigenetic hub, influencing gene expression and contributing to the pathogenesis of various disorders, including Schinzel-Giedion syndrome and certain myeloid malignancies (Piazza2018SETBP1; Banfi2021SETBP1).

## Function
The SETBP1 gene encodes a transcription factor involved in various cellular processes, including DNA replication and transcriptional regulation. In healthy human cells, SETBP1 functions as a DNA-binding protein, primarily through its conserved AT-hook domains, which bind to AT-rich genomic DNA regions. This binding facilitates the regulation of gene expression by recruiting an epigenetic complex involving proteins such as HCF1, KMT2A, and PHF8, which are crucial for chromatin remodeling and transcriptional activation (Piazza2018SETBP1).

SETBP1 is active in the nucleus, where it influences the transcription of genes related to development, including those involved in the nervous system, heart, and bone development (Piazza2018SETBP1). It acts as an epigenetic hub, modulating chromatin accessibility and gene expression through interactions with other transcriptional regulators (Piazza2018SETBP1). The protein's activity is linked to the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation, playing a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and identity (Banfi2021SETBP1).

SETBP1's transcriptional activity is also associated with mitochondrial function, as it regulates gene sets related to mitochondrial structure and function (Whitlock2024The). Its expression and activity vary across different tissues, indicating a role in tissue-specific gene regulation (Whitlock2024The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SETBP1 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. Schinzel-Giedion syndrome (SGS) is a severe developmental disorder caused by de novo germline mutations in SETBP1, particularly within a 12 bp hotspot in exon 4. These mutations disrupt a degron, leading to protein accumulation and are characterized by multiple malformations, severe neurological alterations, and an increased risk of malignancy (AcunaHidalgo2017Overlapping; Zheng2024Novel). Specific mutations, such as D868 and I871, result in increased protein levels and are linked to enhanced cell proliferation and higher cancer incidence (AcunaHidalgo2017Overlapping).

SETBP1 haploinsufficiency disorder (SETBP1-HD), also known as Autosomal Dominant Mental Retardation type 29, results from heterozygous deletions or loss-of-function variants in SETBP1. This disorder presents with a broad spectrum of phenotypes, including mild to moderate neurological symptoms, developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, and behavioral problems (Jansen2021Clinical; Wang2023Identification).

Somatic mutations in SETBP1 are associated with myeloid malignancies, such as myelodysplastic syndromes and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, due to gain-of-function effects. These mutations serve as biomarkers for poor prognosis and leukemic transformation (Wang2023Identification). High SETBP1 expression levels have been correlated with reduced overall survival in certain cancers, including bladder cancer and stomach adenocarcinoma (Wang2023Identification).

## Interactions
SETBP1 (SET binding protein 1) is involved in several physical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation and epigenetic modulation. It interacts with the SET protein, forming a complex that inhibits the activity of the PP2A phosphatase, which is crucial in cell proliferation and oncogenic processes (Banfi2021SETBP1). SETBP1 also binds to genomic DNA, particularly AT-rich regions, through its AT-hook domains, facilitating the activation of gene expression by recruiting an epigenetic complex that includes HCF1, KMT2A, PHF8, and PHF6 (Piazza2018SETBP1).

The protein interacts directly with HCF1, a core component of the SET1/KMT2A complex responsible for H3K4 methylation, and this interaction is crucial for the regulation of gene expression (Piazza2018SETBP1). SETBP1 also forms part of a multiprotein complex with PHF8 and PHF6, which are involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional activation (Piazza2018SETBP1). These interactions highlight SETBP1's role as an epigenetic hub, influencing the transcription of development genes and contributing to the pathogenesis of conditions like Schinzel-Giedion syndrome and atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (Piazza2018SETBP1; Banfi2021SETBP1).
