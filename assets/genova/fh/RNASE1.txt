# RNASE1

## Overview
RNASE1 is a gene that encodes the ribonuclease A family member 1, pancreatic, a secreted enzyme that plays a critical role in the degradation of extracellular RNA (exRNA). This protein is a member of the ribonuclease A superfamily and is predominantly expressed in the pancreas, although it is also found in other tissues such as the brain and kidney. The RNASE1 protein is characterized by its V-shaped fold, consisting of three α-helices and seven β-strands, and is stabilized by disulfide bridges. Functionally, RNASE1 is involved in maintaining vascular homeostasis by modulating exRNA levels, which can influence coagulation and inflammation processes. It is stored in endothelial cell Weibel-Palade bodies and released to act as an RNA scavenger, preventing excessive eRNA accumulation that could lead to vascular inflammation. RNASE1's interactions with cell-surface glycans and its antimicrobial activity further underscore its multifaceted role in cellular processes and immune response (Eller2020Antimicrobial; Lee2019Functional; Bedenbender2020Endothelial).

## Structure
The RNASE1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the ribonuclease A superfamily, primarily involved in RNA degradation. The molecular structure of the human RNase 1 protein, specifically the RNase 1ΔN7 variant, has been determined using X-ray crystallography at a resolution of 1.9 Å. This protein exhibits a V-shaped fold consisting of three α-helices and seven β-strands, with the active-site cleft located centrally. The secondary structural elements are connected by seven loops, and the protein is stabilized by four disulfide bridges (Pous2001Threedimensional).

The RNase 1ΔN7 variant is a truncated form missing seven amino acids from the N-terminus, which affects its ribonucleolytic activity and affinity for the human placental RNase inhibitor (Pous2001Threedimensional). The protein's β-sheet consists of split strands, similar to those found in other ribonucleases like RNase A, EDN, and angiogenin. Notably, the loop connecting helices 1 and 2 (L1) and the loop linking strands 4 and 5 (L6) show significant divergence in length and conformation compared to other RNases (Pous2001Threedimensional).

Post-translational modifications include N-glycosylation, which has been studied for its potential role in pancreatic cancer diagnostics (Nakata2014Increased). The protein is expressed in most human tissues, predominantly in the pancreas, and may serve as a marker for early detection of pancreatic tumors due to distinct glycosylation patterns (Pous2001Threedimensional).

## Function
RNASE1, a member of the RNase A superfamily, is a secreted enzyme primarily involved in the degradation of extracellular RNA (exRNA) in healthy human cells. It is abundantly expressed by endothelial cells and is present in various tissues, including the pancreas, brain, and kidney (Lee2019Functional; Landré2002Human). RNASE1 plays a crucial role in maintaining vascular homeostasis by modulating exRNA levels, which can act as natural procoagulant cofactors and elevate proinflammatory cytokines (Lee2019Functional; Bedenbender2020Endothelial). 

The enzyme's activity is essential for preventing inflammation and tissue damage by degrading both single- and double-stranded RNAs, as well as RNA:DNA hybrids (Lee2019Functional). RNASE1 is stored in Weibel-Palade bodies of endothelial cells and released into the extracellular space, where it acts as an RNA scavenger, preventing excessive eRNA accumulation that can lead to vascular inflammation (Bedenbender2020Endothelial). 

RNASE1's ability to cleave double-stranded RNA may facilitate the removal of heterogeneous RNAs circulating in the blood, thereby mitigating their pro-inflammatory activity (Lu2018Immune). This function is supported by its optimal neutral pH for catalysis, enhancing its activity in biological fluids like blood (Lu2018Immune).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RNASE1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In cardiovascular diseases, RNASE1 plays a protective role by degrading extracellular RNA (eRNA), which is associated with prothrombotic and proinflammatory activities. Dysregulation of RNASE1 can lead to the progression of vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and thrombosis, which are major causes of mortality worldwide (Bedenbender2020Endothelial). In sepsis, RNASE1 levels are initially elevated but may be repressed as the disease progresses, potentially contributing to multi-organ failure and endothelial dysfunction (Laakmann2023Bacterial).

In cancer, RNASE1's RNA-degrading ability is being explored for therapeutic purposes, with artificial variants designed to evade cytosolic RNase inhibitor binding, showing potential in reducing tumor growth (Bedenbender2020Endothelial). RNASE1 is also being investigated as a tumor marker for pancreatic cancer due to its differently glycosylated form in tumor cells (Bedenbender2020Endothelial).

RNASE1's role in inflammation and immune response may link it to autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, where it prevents synovial fibroblast invasion, indicating its involvement in the disease's pathophysiology (Bedenbender2020Endothelial). Understanding the regulation of RNASE1 could lead to new therapeutic strategies to restore its function and protect vascular integrity during inflammation (Bedenbender2020Endothelial).

## Interactions
RNASE1, a member of the ribonuclease A family, engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It is known to bind tightly to cell-surface glycans such as heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, which correlates with its high cellular uptake (Lomax2017Comparative). RNASE1 also interacts with extracellular RNA (eRNA) in blood plasma, playing a role in regulating blood coagulation by degrading eRNA, which affects the activation of plasma proteases factor XII and factor XI (Garnett2019Phenotype).

In the context of antimicrobial activity, RNASE1 can bind to E. coli cells, facilitated by the peptide LL-37, which forms pores in bacterial membranes, allowing RNASE1 to enter and exert its effects (Eller2020Antimicrobial). RNASE1's interaction with the human ribonuclease inhibitor (RNHI) is crucial for preventing potential cytotoxicity. This interaction involves specific regions such as the L6 loop, which is essential for binding to RNHI (FernándezMillán2022Exploring).

During inflammation, RNASE1 expression is repressed in endothelial cells through a mechanism involving the NuRD co-repressor complex and histone deacetylation, mediated by p38 MAPK and CK2 kinase (Bedenbender2020p38). These interactions highlight RNASE1's multifaceted role in cellular processes and its regulation under different physiological conditions.
