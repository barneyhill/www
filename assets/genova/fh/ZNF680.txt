# ZNF680

## Overview
ZNF680 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 680, which is categorized as a transcription factor. This protein is involved in the regulation of gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences, thereby influencing the transcriptional activity of target genes. ZNF680 has been implicated in various biological processes, including cancer progression and immune regulation. In breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer, ZNF680 is associated with the overexpression of the REG3A gene, contributing to tumorigenic behavior through the activation of the Akt-mTOR signaling pathway (Jin2024Increased). Additionally, ZNF680 is part of a prognostic gene signature in early-stage bladder carcinoma and has been linked to epigenetic changes in Alzheimer's disease (Marzi2018A; Liu2020Identification). These associations highlight the gene's potential role in both oncogenic and neurodegenerative contexts.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF680 has been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer. In breast cancer, ZNF680 is associated with the overexpression of the REG3A gene, which promotes tumorigenic behavior in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. This overexpression is linked to the activation of the Akt-mTOR signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation and survival. The study suggests that ZNF680 may act as a transcription factor for REG3A, influencing its expression and contributing to cancer progression (Jin2024Increased).

In difficult-to-treat breast cancer (DTBC), ZNF680 has been identified among genes with mutations, highlighting its potential role in the genetic landscape of these tumors (RajKumar2024Proteogenomic). Additionally, ZNF680 is part of a 17-gene signature used for prognostic purposes in early-stage bladder carcinoma, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Liu2020Identification).

In Alzheimer's disease, significant hypoacetylation within intron 1 of the ZNF680 gene has been observed, suggesting a possible epigenetic alteration associated with the disease (Marzi2018A). These findings underscore the clinical significance of ZNF680 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
ZNF680 is involved in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, primarily functioning as a transcription factor. In breast cancer cells, ZNF680 has been identified as a potential transcription factor for the REG3A gene. It binds to the putative promoter region of REG3A, influencing its expression. This interaction was confirmed through a ChIP assay, which demonstrated significant binding between ZNF680 and the REG3A promoter region, suggesting a direct regulatory role (Jin2024Increased). Silencing ZNF680 using siRNA, lentiviral shRNA, or CRISPR/Cas9 constructs led to a significant downregulation of REG3A mRNA and protein expression, while overexpression of ZNF680 increased REG3A expression (Jin2024Increased).

In the context of immune processes, ZNF680 is mentioned as being involved in immune-specific regulatory elements, although specific interactions with proteins or nucleic acids in this context are not detailed (Chetta2021In). Additionally, ZNF680 is associated with both wild-type and acetylation-mimic mutant TRIM28 (TRIM28-K304Q) in leukemic K562 cells, but specific interactions with proteins or nucleic acids are not elaborated (Chang2023AcetylationMimic).
