# NAA35

## Overview
NAA35 is a gene that encodes the protein N-alpha-acetyltransferase 35, NatC auxiliary subunit, which is a critical component of the N-terminal acetyltransferase NatC complex. This protein functions as an auxiliary subunit and plays a pivotal role in the structural and functional integrity of the NatC complex by facilitating interactions with other subunits, such as NAA30 and NAA38. The NAA35 protein is characterized by its ability to form extensive hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, which are essential for maintaining the stability and assembly of the NatC complex. These interactions are evolutionarily conserved, underscoring their significance in the biological processes mediated by the NatC complex (Grunwald2020Divergent; grunwald2020structural).

## Interactions
NAA35, a subunit of the N-terminal acetyltransferase NatC complex, plays a crucial role in the structural integrity and function of the complex through its interactions with other subunits. NAA35 forms extensive interactions with the catalytic subunit NAA30 and the auxiliary subunit NAA38, acting as the central assembly hub of the NatC complex. It wraps around NAA30 in an open ring-like structure, covering about three-fourths of its circumference, and forms a similar ring-like structure around NAA38, which is primarily tethered to NatC by the N-terminus of NAA35 (Grunwald2020Divergent; grunwald2020structural).

The interactions between NAA35 and NAA38 involve a mixture of hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, with the N-terminal β1-α2-loop-β2 segment of NAA35 forming extensive hydrophobic interactions with NAA38. This segment is crucial for the integrity of the heterotrimeric NatC complex, as its deletion disrupts the interaction with NAA38 (Deng2021Molecular; grunwald2020structural). NAA35 also forms hydrogen bonds with NAA30, contributing to the stability of the complex (Grunwald2020Divergent). These interactions are evolutionarily conserved, highlighting their importance in the function of the NatC complex (grunwald2020structural).
