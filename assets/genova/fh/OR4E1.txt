# OR4E1

## Overview
The OR4E1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily E member 1, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein is primarily involved in the olfactory system, where it functions as a receptor for odorant molecules, playing a critical role in the sense of smell. The OR4E1 protein is expressed in the olfactory epithelium and is responsible for initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of odors (Iglesias2024Identification). Beyond its role in olfaction, OR4E1 has been implicated in various pathological contexts, including cancer, where it may influence tumor growth and metastasis (Park2023Comprehensive). Additionally, genetic variations in OR4E1 have been associated with sleep-related activity levels and intratumoral heterogeneity in certain cancers, although the full clinical implications of these associations remain to be elucidated (Peng2020Integrated; Li2020Automated).

## Function
The OR4E1 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules. These receptors are expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where they are involved in olfactory signal recognition and transduction. Upon binding to specific odorant molecules, OR4E1 initiates a signal transduction pathway that ultimately results in the perception of smell (Iglesias2024Identification).

In healthy human cells, the OR4E1 protein functions by interacting with odorant molecules in the nasal cavity, triggering a cascade of intracellular events that lead to the generation of nerve impulses. These impulses are transmitted to the brain, where they are interpreted as distinct smells. This process is essential for the sense of smell, which is important for various behaviors and physiological responses, such as detecting food, environmental hazards, and pheromones (Masseroli2015Detection).

The olfactory receptor family, including OR4E1, has also been noted for its role in cancer cell growth and progression, promoting invasiveness and metastasis in colorectal cancer cells, although the specific function of OR4E1 in healthy cells remains focused on olfactory processes (Park2023Comprehensive).

## Clinical Significance
The OR4E1 gene, part of the olfactory receptor family, has been implicated in various clinical contexts. In metastatic lung squamous cell carcinoma, a nonsynonymous single nucleotide variant (SNV) in OR4E1 was identified, which may affect the protein's function and contribute to intratumoral genetic heterogeneity. This heterogeneity can influence disease progression and treatment response, although the specific clinical significance of OR4E1 alterations in this context remains unclear (Peng2020Integrated).

In the realm of sleep and circadian rhythms, SNPs near the OR4E1 gene have been associated with mean activity levels during sleep, suggesting a potential link between OR4E1 and sleep-related activity, though the clinical implications are not fully understood (Li2020Automated).

The OR4E1 gene is also noted for its role in cancer biology, particularly in colorectal cancer, where activation of the olfactory receptor family, including OR4E1, is associated with cancer cell growth, invasiveness, and metastasis. This highlights the potential of OR4E1 as a target for drug discovery and anticancer therapies (Park2023Comprehensive).

In Burkitt lymphoma, a nonsynonymous SNV in OR4E1 was identified, but its significance in the disease's pathogenesis is uncertain (Penther2019A).
