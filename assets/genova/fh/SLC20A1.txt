# SLC20A1

## Overview
SLC20A1 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 20 member 1 (PiT-1), which functions as a sodium-dependent inorganic phosphate symporter. This transmembrane protein is characterized by its 12 transmembrane domains, facilitating the transport of phosphate ions across cell membranes, a process vital for numerous cellular activities including energy metabolism, signal transduction, and bone mineralization (Forster2013Phosphate; Rieke2020SLC20A1). PiT-1 is ubiquitously expressed across mammalian tissues, underscoring its essential role in maintaining phosphate homeostasis (Forster2013Phosphate). Beyond its primary function in phosphate transport, PiT-1 is involved in cellular processes such as proliferation and apoptosis, and its dysregulation is associated with various pathological conditions, including cancer and metabolic disorders (Rieke2020SLC20A1; CorreiaBranco2023SLC20a1PiT1).

## Structure
The SLC20A1 gene encodes the PiT-1 protein, a sodium-dependent inorganic phosphate symporter characterized by its structure with 12 transmembrane domains (TMDs) (Forster2013Phosphate; Rieke2020SLC20A1). These TMDs are integral to its function in phosphate transport across cell membranes. The protein's structure includes extracellular N- and C-terminal tails, as well as a large intracellular loop between TMDs 7 and 8 (Forster2013Phosphate; Rieke2020SLC20A1).

The primary structure of PiT-1 involves specific amino acid sequences that contribute to its function, such as the glycine residue at position 237, which is crucial for maintaining stability in TMD 6 (Rieke2020SLC20A1). The secondary structure is likely composed of alpha-helices formed by these transmembrane domains, which are typical for proteins involved in transport functions.

In terms of tertiary structure, the protein's folding is essential for its role as a symporter, with the 3D model suggesting interactions between TMD 6 and TMD 1 (Rieke2020SLC20A1). The quaternary structure may involve interactions with other proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur, influencing the protein's function and localization, though specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. The presence of splice variant isoforms is not mentioned in the context.

## Function
The SLC20A1 gene encodes the PiT-1 protein, a sodium-dependent phosphate transporter involved in the uptake of inorganic phosphate (Pi) across cell membranes, which is crucial for various cellular processes (Rieke2020SLC20A1; CorreiaBranco2023SLC20a1PiT1). PiT-1 is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues, indicating a fundamental role in maintaining phosphate homeostasis (Forster2013Phosphate). In healthy human cells, PiT-1 facilitates phosphate transport, which is essential for energy metabolism, signal transduction, and bone mineralization (Rieke2020SLC20A1).

Beyond its role in phosphate transport, PiT-1 is implicated in cell proliferation and apoptosis. Overexpression of wild-type SLC20A1 increases levels of the apoptosis marker cleaved caspase-3 (CC3), suggesting a role in apoptosis pathways (Rieke2020SLC20A1). The protein is also involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, as its depletion leads to reduced cell proliferation and impaired mitosis (Forster2013Phosphate).

PiT-1 is active in various tissues, including the placenta, where it is crucial for nutrient transport between maternal and fetal circulatory systems, and in the kidney and small intestine, contributing to transepithelial phosphate transport (Forster2013Phosphate; CorreiaBranco2023SLC20a1PiT1). Its expression is regulated by factors such as IGF-1 and BMP2, and it plays a role in bone phosphate homeostasis and vascular calcification (Forster2013Phosphate).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SLC20A1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), high expression of SLC20A1 is associated with poor prognosis and is linked to mutations in key driver genes such as KRAS, CDKN2A, TP53, and SMAD4. Knockdown of SLC20A1 in PDAC cell lines reduces tumorsphere formation and cell viability, indicating its role in cancer progression and as a potential therapeutic target (Matsuoka2024Co‑expression).

SLC20A1 has also been identified as a potential risk factor for combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD). De novo missense variants in SLC20A1, such as L89S and L521F, have been found in patients with CPHD, suggesting a pathogenic role in pituitary development (Simm2018Identification).

In somatotroph adenomas, silencing SLC20A1 affects the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, reducing cell proliferation and invasion, and altering the expression of genes associated with cell migration (Li2019Impact).

Furthermore, SLC20A1 is essential for normal skeletal muscle function, with its absence leading to severe myopathy and early death in mice, highlighting its critical role in muscle fiber survival (Chande2020Slc20a1Pit1).
