# NFIL3

## Overview
NFIL3, also known as E4BP4, is a gene that encodes a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor involved in various biological processes, particularly in the immune system. The NFIL3 protein functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor, influencing the development and regulation of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and natural killer (NK) cells. It plays a critical role in the emergence of common helper-like ILC precursors from common lymphoid progenitors, which are essential for the development of ILC subsets such as ILC1, ILC2, and ILC3 (Xu2015NFIL3; Yu2014The). Beyond its role in immune cell differentiation, NFIL3 is implicated in the regulation of gene expression through interactions with other transcription factors and signaling pathways, including the IL-6 JAK STAT3 and TNF pathways (Du2022NFIL3). Dysregulation of NFIL3 expression has been associated with various diseases, including cancer and autoimmune disorders, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and pathological conditions (Yang2022Elevated; Du2022NFIL3).

## Structure
The NFIL3 protein, also known as E4BP4, is a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor. Its primary structure consists of 462 amino acids, featuring a bZIP domain that spans amino acids 73-146. This domain is divided into two parts: the N-terminal basic region (amino acids 79-95) responsible for direct DNA binding, and the C-terminal leucine zipper region (amino acids 99-106) that facilitates homo-dimerization and hetero-dimerization interactions (Keniry2014New). The protein also contains a unique transcriptional repression domain between amino acids 299-363, which is crucial for its function as a repressor (Cowell1994Transcriptional).

NFIL3 lacks the proline and acidic amino-acid rich (PAR) transactivation domain found in other PAR bZIP transcription factors, which distinguishes its function as a repressor rather than an activator (MacGillavry2011Genomewide). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and stability. Multiple splice variants of NFIL3 exist, potentially altering its functional domains and affecting its role in various biological processes (MacGillavry2011Genomewide).

## Function
The NFIL3 gene, also known as E4BP4, encodes a basic leucine zipper transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the development and regulation of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and natural killer (NK) cells. NFIL3 is essential for the emergence of common helper-like ILC precursors (CHILPs) from common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs), which are critical for the development of various ILC subsets, including ILC1, ILC2, and ILC3 (Xu2015NFIL3; Yu2014The). NFIL3 functions in a hematopoietic cell-intrinsic manner, acting within the cells that give rise to blood and immune cells (Xu2015NFIL3).

NFIL3 is expressed at high levels in all helper-like ILC subsets and NK cells, but at low levels in adaptive B and T lymphocytes (Xu2015NFIL3). It regulates the expression of the transcriptional repressor ID2, which is crucial for the development of all known ILC subsets, including NK cells (Xu2015NFIL3). NFIL3 is also involved in the regulation of IgE class switching in B cells, binding to specific promoter regions to enhance transcriptional activity in response to external stimuli (Kashiwada2009IL-4-induced). Overall, NFIL3 is a key transcription factor that orchestrates the emergence of ILC precursors and is essential for the proper functioning of the immune system (Xu2015NFIL3).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NFIL3 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and autoimmune conditions. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), NFIL3 acts as an oncogene by enhancing NF-κB signaling, which promotes cancer progression. Overexpression of NFIL3 leads to increased NF-κB activity, while its knockdown reduces this activity, suggesting that targeting NFIL3 could be a therapeutic strategy for TNBC (Yang2022Elevated). In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), NFIL3 is significantly upregulated and associated with inflammatory pathways, including the IL-17 and TNF signaling pathways. This suggests that NFIL3 plays a role in the inflammatory response and immune regulation in RA (Du2022NFIL3).

NFIL3 is also involved in T-cell dysfunction in the context of chronic infections and cancer. It regulates the expression of Tim-3 and IL-10, contributing to T-cell exhaustion. This mechanism is significant in chronic diseases where T-cell exhaustion impairs immune responses, and targeting the IL-27/NFIL3 signaling axis could offer therapeutic benefits (Zhu2015An). In natural killer (NK) cell development, NFIL3 is essential for the maturation of NK cells, and its deficiency disrupts this process, potentially affecting immune surveillance (Kamizono2009Nfil3E4bp4).

## Interactions
NFIL3, also known as E4BP4, is a transcription factor that participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It acts as a repressor of CREB-induced gene expression, which is crucial for neuronal outgrowth and regeneration. NFIL3 binds to promoter regions of genes, often sharing a C/EBP DNA binding motif, and acts as a general feed-forward repressor of bZIP transcription factors, including C/EBPs, which control neurite outgrowth (MacGillavry2011Genomewide). NFIL3 interacts with the repressor protein Dr1, which binds the TATA-box binding protein TBP, preventing the formation of the pre-initiation complex (MacGillavry2011Genomewide).

In the context of immune regulation, NFIL3 binds to conserved sequences within the Foxp3 gene, crucial for regulatory T cell function and stability. It also physically interacts with the Foxp3 protein, suggesting a role in regulating Foxp3 expression through both DNA binding and direct protein-protein interactions (Kim2019The). NFIL3 is involved in the IL-6 JAK STAT3 signaling pathway and TNF signaling, which are important in rheumatoid arthritis development (Du2022NFIL3). In cardiomyocytes, NFIL3 binds directly to the IGF2R promoter, inhibiting its expression and reducing hypoxia-induced apoptosis (Lin2015NFIL3).
