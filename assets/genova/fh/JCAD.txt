# JCAD

## Overview
JCAD, or junctional cadherin 5 associated, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of endothelial cell-cell junctions. The protein, also referred to as JCAD, is a component of VE-cadherin-based junctions and plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and organization of endothelial cellular sheets. Despite lacking well-defined functional domains, JCAD contains a proline-rich region and sequences similar to those in proteins involved in Rho signaling, suggesting a potential, albeit limited, role in these pathways (Akashi2011A). JCAD is implicated in several cellular processes, including the regulation of the Hippo signaling pathway through its interaction with LATS2, which affects cell proliferation (Ye2017JCAD). Clinically, JCAD is associated with cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease and atherosclerosis, as well as conditions like cholestatic liver disease and pathological angiogenesis (Shigeoka2020JCAD; Xie2024JCAD; Xu2019The).

## Function
JCAD, also known as junctional cadherin 5 associated, is a protein that plays a significant role in endothelial cell-cell junctions. It is specifically localized at these junctions in a VE-cadherin-dependent manner, which is crucial for the organization and permeability of endothelial cellular sheets (Akashi2011A). JCAD colocalizes with VE-cadherin at cell-cell contacts, and its proper localization requires VE-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion, although it is not essential for the adhesion itself (Akashi2011A). The protein is highly conserved across vertebrate species and is associated with coronary artery disease through genome-wide association studies (Akashi2011A).

Despite lacking obvious domain structures with predicted functions, JCAD contains a proline-rich region and a sequence homologous to regions in proteins like ROCK1, ROCK2, and cingulin, suggesting a potential role in Rho signaling (Akashi2011A). However, no significant changes in Rho and ROCK activities were observed in JCAD-knockdown cells, indicating that its role in these pathways may be limited or context-dependent (Akashi2011A). JCAD's presence at endothelial junctions suggests it contributes to maintaining the integrity and organization of these junctions, although its precise function in healthy human cells remains incompletely understood (Akashi2011A).

## Clinical Significance
The JCAD gene, also known as KIAA1462, has been implicated in several cardiovascular diseases, most notably coronary artery disease (CAD) and atherosclerosis. Alterations in JCAD expression are associated with endothelial dysfunction, a key factor in the development of atherosclerosis. Studies have shown that JCAD expression is increased in response to disturbed blood flow, a condition that promotes atherosclerosis, and is elevated in atherosclerotic plaques in both mice and humans (Xu2019The). JCAD promotes the activation of the YAP/TAZ pathway, which is linked to pro-atherogenic processes, and its deficiency leads to reduced vascular inflammation and atherosclerotic plaque formation (Xu2019The).

In addition to its role in cardiovascular diseases, JCAD has been studied in the context of cholestatic liver disease. It is highly expressed in fibroblast-like cells in primary biliary cholangitis and in mice with bile duct ligation. JCAD knock-out alleviates bile ductular reaction and fibrosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in cholestatic liver disease (Xie2024JCAD).

JCAD's involvement in pathological angiogenesis and its expression in inflamed areas further underscore its clinical significance in conditions like tumorigenesis and Alzheimer's disease (Shigeoka2020JCAD).

## Interactions
JCAD, also known as junctional cadherin 5 associated, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with LATS2, a core kinase in the Hippo signaling pathway, by binding to its kinase domain. This interaction inhibits LATS2's ability to phosphorylate YAP, a downstream effector, leading to YAP's nuclear translocation and activation of transcriptional activity, which promotes cell proliferation (Ye2017JCAD). JCAD does not affect the interaction between LATS2 and MOB1/2, another regulator in the Hippo pathway (Ye2017JCAD).

In endothelial cells, JCAD is a component of VE-cadherin-based cell-cell junctions, and its localization is dependent on VE-cadherin-mediated adhesion (Akashi2011A). JCAD interacts with actin-binding proteins, such as TRIOBP, to regulate F-actin dependent YAP/TAZ activation, which is crucial for endothelial cell function (Xu2019The). It also associates with several other proteins, including Armadillo repeat-containing protein 8 (ARMC8) and Filamin-C (FLNC), as identified by immunoprecipitation-based mass spectrometry (Xu2019The). These interactions suggest that JCAD plays a significant role in regulating endothelial cell function and proliferation.
