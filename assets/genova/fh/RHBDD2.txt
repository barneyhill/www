# RHBDD2

## Overview
RHBDD2 is a gene that encodes the rhomboid domain containing 2 protein, a member of the rhomboid pseudoprotease family. This protein is characterized by its multi-pass transmembrane structure and is primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting a role in protein trafficking and cellular homeostasis (Canzoneri2018Alternative; Ferretti2021RHBDD2‑WWOX). Although RHBDD2 lacks catalytic activity, it is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of protein turnover and degradation, and the modulation of signaling pathways such as TGFβ/SMAD3 (Ferretti2021RHBDD2‑WWOX). The protein's interactions, particularly with the WWOX tumor suppressor, highlight its potential role in cell proliferation and differentiation, as well as its involvement in stress response mechanisms like the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Palma2020RHBDD2; Ferretti2021RHBDD2‑WWOX). RHBDD2's expression is notably altered in certain cancers, where it is associated with tumor progression and chemoresistance, underscoring its clinical significance (Palma2020RHBDD2; Ferretti2021RHBDD2‑WWOX).

## Structure
The RHBDD2 protein is an integral and polytopic protein characterized by five transmembrane domains and a proline-rich region (PRR) at its C-terminus (Ferretti2021RHBDD2‑WWOX). This PRR contains a conserved LPPY motif, which is crucial for its interaction with the WWOX protein, facilitated by the WW domains of WWOX that bind to proline-rich ligand consensus motifs like LPPY (Ferretti2021RHBDD2‑WWOX). The protein is a member of the rhomboid pseudoprotease family, indicating it lacks catalytic activity but retains structural features similar to active rhomboid proteases, such as a multi-pass transmembrane structure (Lemberg2016Inactive).

RHBDD2 has two splice variant isoforms: RHBDD2-1, which encodes a 364 amino acid protein known as isoform A, and RHBDD2-2, which encodes a 223 amino acid protein called isoform B. Isoform B has a shorter N-terminus and is translated from an internal AUG codon in exon III (Canzoneri2018Alternative). The protein is primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus, suggesting a role in protein trafficking (Canzoneri2018Alternative). The C-terminal region of RHBDD2 also contains noncanonical SH3-binding motifs and several putative phosphorylation sites, indicating potential post-translational modifications (Palma2020RHBDD2).

## Function
RHBDD2 is a pseudoprotease member of the rhomboid family, primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. It is involved in recognizing and recruiting target proteins to regulate their subcellular fate, turnover, and degradation, impacting various signaling pathways and pathophysiological processes (Ferretti2021RHBDD2‑WWOX). In healthy human cells, RHBDD2 is overexpressed during mammary gland development, suggesting a role in cell proliferation and differentiation (Ferretti2021RHBDD2‑WWOX). The protein interacts with the WWOX tumor suppressor, potentially modulating the TGFβ/SMAD3 signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation and differentiation (Ferretti2021RHBDD2‑WWOX).

RHBDD2 is also associated with the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway, which is activated in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress. This association suggests a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis through stress response mechanisms (Palma2020RHBDD2). The protein's localization in the Golgi apparatus and its involvement in vesicle transport indicate a potential role in protein trafficking (Ferretti2021RHBDD2‑WWOX). Despite these insights, the specific function of RHBDD2 in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated, though its involvement in cellular proliferation and differentiation is evident (Ferretti2015Spatiotemporal).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RHBDD2 gene have been linked to the progression and poor prognosis of several cancers, including breast and colorectal cancer. In breast cancer, RHBDD2 is overexpressed in advanced stages and is associated with tumor progression and chemoresistance to neoadjuvant therapy. This overexpression is particularly noted in the basal-like subtype of breast cancer, which is characterized by high proliferation and a long-term risk of recurrence (Canzoneri2018Alternative; Ferretti2021RHBDD2‑WWOX). The RHBDD2-2 splicing variant is more frequently expressed in breast tumors and is linked to poor prognostic factors, such as increased proliferative and Risk-Of-Recurrence scores (Canzoneri2018Alternative).

In colorectal cancer, RHBDD2 overexpression is associated with chemoresistance and invasiveness. It modulates the unfolded protein response (UPR) and focal adhesion genes, which are crucial for cancer cell adaptation to stress and metastasis. High RHBDD2 expression post-treatment correlates with metastasis, suggesting its role in tumor progression and response to therapy (Palma2020RHBDD2). The interaction between RHBDD2 and the WWOX protein may also play a role in modulating signaling pathways that affect cell proliferation and differentiation, potentially impacting cancer outcomes (Ferretti2021RHBDD2‑WWOX).

## Interactions
RHBDD2, a member of the rhomboid pseudoprotease family, is known to interact with several proteins, influencing various cellular processes. One significant interaction is with WWOX, a tumor suppressor protein. This interaction is characterized by the binding of RHBDD2's conserved LPPY motif to the WW domains of WWOX. The RHBDD2-WWOX interaction is more pronounced in proliferating cells, particularly in the membrane fractions, and is associated with the modulation of the TGFβ/SMAD3 signaling pathway. This interaction affects the expression of SMAD3 target genes, such as follistatin and angiopoietin-like 4, which are involved in cell proliferation and differentiation (Ferretti2021RHBDD2‑WWOX).

In colorectal cancer, RHBDD2 interacts with BiP, a master regulator of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway. This interaction suggests a role for RHBDD2 in stress response and protein relocalization. RHBDD2 overexpression is linked to increased expression of UPR genes like BiP and decreased expression of others such as PERK and CHOP, contributing to a chemoresistant and invasive phenotype in cancer cells (Palma2020RHBDD2). These interactions highlight RHBDD2's involvement in critical signaling pathways and its potential impact on cancer progression.
