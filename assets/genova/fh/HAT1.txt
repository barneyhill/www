# HAT1

## Overview
Histone acetyltransferase 1 (HAT1) is a gene that encodes a type B histone acetyltransferase protein, which plays a pivotal role in chromatin assembly and histone modification. The HAT1 protein is primarily involved in the acetylation of newly synthesized histone H4, a process essential for chromatin assembly during DNA replication. This acetylation facilitates the transport and organization of histone H3/H4 dimers into nucleosomes, thereby influencing chromatin maturation and gene expression regulation (Poziello2020Recent; Tafrova2014Human). HAT1 also interacts with various proteins, including the regulatory subunit RbAp46, enhancing its acetyltransferase activity and substrate specificity (Verreault1998Nucleosomal). Beyond its role in chromatin dynamics, HAT1 is implicated in DNA repair processes and the acetylation of non-histone substrates, affecting cellular pathways such as transcriptional regulation and mitochondrial function (Agudelo2020Hat1Dependent). The gene's expression and function are linked to several diseases, including cancers and viral infections, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Ortega2023Understanding; Wang2023HAT1).

## Structure
The human HAT1 protein is characterized by an elongated structure composed of three domains: N-terminal, central, and C-terminal. The central and C-terminal domains form a canyon that accommodates the cofactor acetyl coenzyme A (Ac-CoA) and the histone H4 peptide (Poziello2020Recent; Tafrova2014Human). The binding of Ac-CoA is facilitated by interactions involving specific residues such as Phe288 and Lys284, which enhance the binding strength compared to its yeast counterpart (Poziello2020Recent).

HAT1 exists in two isoforms, HAT1a and HAT1b, with 418 and 334 amino acids, respectively. HAT1a is localized in the nuclear matrix, while HAT1b is found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus (Ortega2023Understanding; Tafrova2014Human). The holoenzyme form of HAT1 includes the regulatory subunit RbAp46, which enhances its acetyltransferase activity by promoting the association with core histones (Verreault1998Nucleosomal).

The tertiary structure of HAT1 involves a conserved core domain crucial for its enzymatic activity, with the N and C-terminal domains playing significant roles in substrate binding (Marmorstein2001Structurea). The quaternary structure includes its interaction with RbAp46, forming a complex that efficiently binds histone H4 (Verreault1998Nucleosomal).

## Function
Histone acetyltransferase 1 (HAT1) is a type B histone acetyltransferase primarily involved in the acetylation of newly synthesized histone H4 at lysine residues 5 and 12. This acetylation is crucial for chromatin assembly during DNA replication, facilitating the transport of histone H3/H4 dimers into the nucleus and their subsequent organization into nucleosomes (Poziello2020Recent; Tafrova2014Human). HAT1 forms a holoenzyme with the regulatory subunit RbAp46, enhancing its acetyltransferase activity and substrate specificity (Poziello2020Recent).

In healthy human cells, HAT1 is predominantly nuclear, where it stably binds histones H3 and H4, playing a significant role in chromatin maturation and gene expression regulation (Poziello2020Recent). It is also involved in DNA repair processes, interacting with proteins such as RAD50 and RAD51, and facilitating repair through histone H4 acetylation (Poziello2020Recent). HAT1's activity is essential for maintaining genome stability, as its absence leads to increased sensitivity to DNA damage and chromosomal abnormalities (Nagarajan2013Histone).

HAT1 also acetylates non-histone substrates, influencing various cellular pathways, including transcriptional regulation and mitochondrial function (Agudelo2020Hat1Dependent). Despite its critical roles, HAT1 is not required for histone nuclear import or deposition onto newly replicated DNA, suggesting its functions may be more specialized or redundant in certain contexts (Poziello2020Recent).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the HAT1 gene are linked to various diseases, particularly cancers and viral infections. In cancer, HAT1 is implicated in DNA damage repair and telomeric silencing, with high expression associated with poor outcomes in several tumor types, including lower-grade gliomas, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and nasopharyngeal cancer (Ortega2023Understanding; Wang2023HAT1). In contrast, downregulation of HAT1 in lung cancer and melanoma is linked to apoptosis and therapy resistance (Ortega2023Understanding). HAT1 also plays a role in immune evasion and chemoresistance, interacting with proteins like EZH2 and PVT1 (Ortega2023Understanding).

In viral infections, HAT1 is involved in the replication of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It is upregulated in HBV infection, facilitating the formation of the cccDNA minichromosome, and in HIV, it is associated with monocyte activation and immune progression markers (Ortega2023Understanding; Poziello2020Recent). HAT1's role in inflammatory diseases includes its involvement in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and atherosclerosis, where it affects inflammatory cytokine expression and macrophage transformation (Ortega2023Understanding). These associations highlight HAT1 as a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
HAT1, a histone acetyltransferase, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for chromatin assembly and histone modification. It forms a complex with the core-histone-binding subunit p46, enhancing its acetyltransferase activity by approximately 15-fold when p46 is in a 3-4-fold molar excess over HAT1. This complex efficiently binds to histone H4 and, to a lesser extent, to histone H2A, but not to H2B or H3 (Tafrova2014Human; Verreault1998Nucleosomal). The p46 subunit alone can bind both H2A and H4, suggesting it facilitates the association of HAT1 with core histones (Verreault1998Nucleosomal).

HAT1 also interacts with RbAp46 (Hat2), forming a complex that remains associated with H3/H4 throughout nuclear import and histone deposition, indicating a role in chromatin assembly pathways (Agudelo2017Identification; Yue2022Topography). The HAT1-Hat2 complex is involved in acetylating lysine 12 of histone H4, with Hat2 enhancing both the activity and specificity of HAT1 (Yue2022Topography). Additionally, HAT1 is associated with the histone chaperones NASP and ASF1, which facilitate nucleosome assembly by binding H3-H4 heterodimers (Yue2022Topography). These interactions highlight HAT1's role in histone modification and chromatin dynamics.
