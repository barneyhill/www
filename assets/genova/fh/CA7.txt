# CA7

## Overview
The CA7 gene encodes the enzyme carbonic anhydrase VII (CA VII), which is a member of the alpha-class carbonic anhydrase family. This enzyme is primarily cytosolic and plays a crucial role in the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide, facilitating the conversion to bicarbonate and protons, which is essential for maintaining acid-base balance and CO2 transport in the body (Yang2015Prognostic; Imtaiyaz2013Structure). CA VII is predominantly expressed in the brain, where it contributes to pH regulation and neuronal function, and is also found in other tissues such as the salivary glands and hippocampus (AdevaAndany2015The). The enzyme's high catalytic activity is particularly important in tissues with high metabolic rates. Clinically, CA VII has been implicated in colorectal carcinoma, where its expression levels are associated with tumor progression and patient prognosis, suggesting a potential tumor-suppressing role (Yang2015Prognostic). Despite its known functions, the full physiological and pathophysiological roles of CA VII remain to be fully elucidated.

## Structure
The CA7 gene encodes the carbonic anhydrase VII enzyme, which is part of the alpha-class carbonic anhydrase family. The primary structure of CA VII consists of 263 amino acid residues, showing significant sequence identity with other human carbonic anhydrases, such as CA I, CA II, and CA III (Montgomery1991Characterization). The tertiary structure of CA VII is predicted to be similar to that of human CA II, with conserved regions forming part of the active site cavity (Montgomery1991Characterization). This structure includes key residues involved in zinc ion binding, such as His-94, His-96, and His-119, which are conserved across different isozymes (Montgomery1991Characterization).

The CA VII protein is likely cytosolic, as indicated by the absence of a signal peptide (Montgomery1991Characterization). It is characterized by a high degree of divergence from other human CA isozymes, yet maintains conservation in regions critical for enzyme activity (Montgomery1991Characterization). The protein does not appear to have a quaternary structure, as there is no mention of multiple polypeptide subunits. The presence of a single potential N-linked glycosylation site suggests possible post-translational modifications, although it may be nonfunctional (Montgomery1991Characterization).

## Function
Carbonic anhydrase 7 (CA7) is a cytosolic enzyme that plays a significant role in the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and protons, a process crucial for maintaining acid-base balance and facilitating CO2 transport in the body (Yang2015Prognostic). CA7 is predominantly expressed in the brain, where it contributes to pH regulation and neuronal function (Imtaiyaz2013Structure). This enzyme is also expressed in other tissues, including the salivary glands and hippocampus, although its distribution in other tissues remains largely unknown (AdevaAndany2015The).

In cellular processes, CA7 interacts with bicarbonate transporters such as NBCe1-B, enhancing their activity, which is essential for maintaining cellular ion balance and pH homeostasis (Hong2015Essential). The enzyme's high catalytic activity is particularly important in tissues with high metabolic rates, where rapid conversion of CO2 to bicarbonate is necessary to prevent acidosis and support metabolic functions (Yang2015Prognostic). Despite its known roles, the specific physiological functions and potential pathophysiological implications of CA7 deficiency or dysfunction in humans are not fully understood (AdevaAndany2015The).

## Clinical Significance
Carbonic anhydrase VII (CA7) has been identified as having significant clinical implications in colorectal carcinoma (CRC). Studies have shown that CA7 expression is significantly downregulated in CRC tissues compared to adjacent normal mucosa, both at the mRNA and protein levels. This downregulation is associated with poor differentiation, positive lymph node metastasis, advanced TNM stage, and increased patient mortality, suggesting a potential tumor-suppressing role for CA7 (Yang2015Prognostic). 

Low CA7 expression is correlated with shorter disease-specific survival rates in CRC patients, making it a significant independent prognostic factor, particularly in early-stage tumors. Patients with low CA7 expression have been observed to have a 5-year disease-specific survival rate of 44.8%, compared to 73.2% for those with high CA7 expression (Yang2015Prognostic). These findings suggest that CA7 could serve as a valuable biomarker for prognosis prediction and clinical outcome improvement in CRC patients (Yang2015Prognostic). 

While the role of CA7 in other diseases is not detailed in the provided context, its involvement in CRC highlights its potential significance in cancer biology and patient prognosis.

## Interactions
Carbonic anhydrase 7 (CA7) is known to interact with bicarbonate transporters, specifically the NBCe1-B transporter. Both CA7 and its mutant form, CA7(E118A), have been shown to interact with NBCe1-B, although these interactions do not significantly affect the transporter's activity (Hong2015Essential). The study suggests that while CA7 can bind to NBCe1-B, it does not have a major stimulatory or inhibitory effect on its function, unlike other carbonic anhydrases such as CA12, which can modulate the activity of bicarbonate transporters like AE2 (Hong2015Essential).

The potential for CA7 to interact with anion exchangers is also suggested by the conservation of certain sequences within the enzyme. CA7 has a pI of 5.98, with four out of five histidines conserved, and the fifth replaced by a glutamine, indicating a potential for interaction with anion exchangers (McDevitt2011Molecular). However, specific interactions of CA7 with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond these observations are not detailed in the available literature.
