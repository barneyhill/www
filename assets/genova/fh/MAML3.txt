# MAML3

## Overview
MAML3 (Mastermind-like transcriptional coactivator 3) is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which functions as a transcriptional coactivator within the Notch signaling pathway. This protein is integral to the regulation of gene expression, influencing cell fate determination, differentiation, and proliferation. As a transcriptional coactivator, MAML3 forms complexes with the intracellular domains of Notch receptors and CSL DNA-binding proteins, thereby facilitating the transcription of Notch target genes (Oyama2011Mastermindlike). The protein's involvement in the Notch signaling pathway underscores its significance in developmental processes and tissue homeostasis. Additionally, MAML3 has been implicated in various cancers, where it interacts with other signaling pathways such as Hedgehog and Wnt/β-catenin, contributing to tumor progression and metastasis (Monteagudo2023MAML3fusions; NA2023MAML3). The gene's role in these pathways highlights its potential as a therapeutic target in oncology.

## Function
MAML3 (Mastermind-like transcriptional coactivator 3) is a protein that plays a critical role in the Notch signaling pathway, which is essential for cell fate determination, differentiation, and proliferation. MAML3 functions as a transcriptional coactivator by forming transcriptionally activating complexes with the intracellular domains of Notch receptors and CSL DNA-binding proteins, facilitating the transcription of Notch target genes (Oyama2011Mastermindlike). This interaction is crucial for the full activation of Notch signaling, which is involved in various developmental processes and tissue homeostasis (Oyama2011Mastermindlike).

In murine models, MAML3 has been shown to be essential for proper Notch signaling during development, as its absence, along with MAML1, leads to significant developmental defects and early embryonic death (Oyama2011Mastermindlike). However, MAML3-null mice do not exhibit apparent abnormalities, suggesting that other MAML family members may compensate for its loss in certain contexts (Oyama2011Mastermindlike). The specific in vivo functions of MAML3 in healthy human cells remain less clear, but its involvement in Notch signaling suggests a role in maintaining cellular differentiation and proliferation processes (Oyama2011Mastermindlike).

## Clinical Significance
MAML3 (Mastermind-like transcriptional coactivator 3) is implicated in various cancers due to its role in transcriptional regulation. In pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL), MAML3-fusions, such as TCF4-MAML3 and UBTF-MAML3, are associated with increased metastatic risk and a unique tumor microenvironment. These fusions lead to the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and MYC targets, contributing to tumor progression and metastatic behavior (Monteagudo2023MAML3fusions). MAML3-fusion-positive tumors exhibit a distinct vascular architecture and immune profile, characterized by overexpression of angiogenesis-related genes and infiltration of pro-tumor immune cells (Monteagudo2023MAML3fusions).

In gallbladder cancer (GBC), MAML3 expression is upregulated under hypoxic conditions, enhancing cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. This is mediated through the activation of the Hedgehog (HH) and NOTCH signaling pathways, contributing to the malignant phenotype of GBC (NA2023MAML3). MAML3 also influences drug resistance, with reduced expression leading to increased resistance to gemcitabine, a chemotherapeutic agent (NA2023MAML3).

In neuroendocrine tumors, MAML3 overexpression is linked to increased tumor aggressiveness and progression. It interacts with β-catenin, activating WNT signaling pathways, which are crucial for tumorigenicity and invasion (Alzofon2021Mastermind).

## Interactions
MAML3 (Mastermind-like transcriptional coactivator 3) is known to interact with the Notch signaling pathway, serving as a coactivator for Notch receptors. It forms a transcriptionally active complex with the intracellular domain of Notch and the DNA-binding protein CSL (CBF1/Su(H)/LAG-1), which is essential for the transcriptional activation of Notch target genes (Oyama2011Mastermindlike). MAML3 is involved in the transcription of Smoothened (SMO), a key protein in the Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway, and acts as a NOTCH signaling activator, indicating its role in modulating multiple signaling pathways (NA2023MAML3).

In the context of gallbladder cancer, MAML3 interacts with the Hedgehog and NOTCH signaling pathways, contributing to cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, particularly under hypoxic conditions (NA2023MAML3). MAML3's role as a transcriptional coactivator in the NOTCH pathway suggests it can induce migration and proliferation of gallbladder cancer cells under hypoxia (NA2023MAML3). The protein's involvement in these pathways highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for disrupting signaling in cancer progression (NA2023MAML3).
