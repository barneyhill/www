# P2RX1

## Overview
The P2RX1 gene encodes the purinergic receptor P2X1, a member of the P2X receptor family, which functions as a ligand-gated ion channel. This receptor is activated by extracellular ATP and is primarily expressed in smooth muscle cells, neutrophils, and platelets. The P2X1 receptor plays a significant role in various physiological processes, including muscle contraction, platelet aggregation, and immune responses. Structurally, the receptor is characterized by two transmembrane domains and a large extracellular loop, forming a trimeric quaternary structure essential for its function (Liang2001Structure; Illes2020Update; North2002Molecular). The receptor's involvement in processes such as vasoconstriction, thrombosis, and inflammation underscores its clinical significance, with implications in conditions like renal ischemia/reperfusion injury, inflammatory bowel disease, and cancer metastasis (Wang2021P2RX1Involved; Zhuang2021Targeting; Darbousset2014P2X1).

## Structure
The P2RX1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the P2X receptor family, which are ligand-gated ion channels activated by ATP. The primary structure of the P2X1 receptor consists of 399 amino acids (Illes2020Update). The secondary structure includes two transmembrane domains separated by a large extracellular loop, with short intracellular N- and C-termini (Liang2001Structure; North2002Molecular). The tertiary structure is characterized by a trimeric quaternary structure, where three subunits assemble to form a functional channel (North2002Molecular; Fausther2012Role).

The extracellular domain contains ten conserved cysteine residues that form five disulfide bridges, contributing to the protein's stability and function (KaczmarekHájek2012Molecular). The P2X1 receptor also features key lysine residues, such as Lys-68 and Lys-70, which are crucial for ATP binding (North2002Molecular). Post-translational modifications include glycosylation, which is essential for proper trafficking to the cell surface, with five consensus sequences for N-linked glycosylation identified (North2002Molecular). The receptor can form both homomeric and heteromeric channels, although P2X7 does not coassemble with other subunits (North2002Molecular).

## Function
The P2RX1 gene encodes the P2X1 receptor, a purinergic receptor that functions as a ligand-gated ion channel activated by extracellular ATP. In healthy human cells, P2X1 receptors are primarily expressed in smooth muscle cells, where they play a crucial role in mediating muscle contraction, particularly in the vasculature and urinary tract. Activation of P2X1 receptors leads to an influx of calcium ions, which is essential for processes such as vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation (Fausther2012Role).

In neutrophils, P2X1 receptors are involved in various aspects of immune function. They enhance neutrophil chemokinesis, which is the random migration of these cells, through Rho kinase signaling. However, P2X1 activation does not induce directional chemotaxis. The receptor also plays a significant role in enhancing neutrophil phagocytosis, a process crucial for pathogen elimination (Wang2018Purinergic).

P2X1 receptors are implicated in the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which are structures that trap and kill pathogens. This process is facilitated by the interaction between neutrophils and platelets, mediated by P2X1, which enhances NETs generation and contributes to inflammatory responses (Zhuang2021Targeting).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the P2RX1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) liver metastasis, P2RX1 deficiency is associated with an immunosuppressive microenvironment that promotes tumor growth. P2RX1-negative neutrophils accumulate in the liver metastases, exhibiting immunosuppressive phenotypes that contribute to immune exhaustion and tumor progression. These neutrophils express high levels of PD-L1, which inhibits cytotoxic T lymphocytes, facilitating immune evasion by the tumor (Wang2021Identification).

In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly colitis, P2RX1 expression is significantly upregulated in inflamed tissues. This upregulation is linked to treatment resistance in ulcerative colitis patients who do not respond to anti-TNF therapy. P2RX1 knockout mice show reduced severity of colitis, suggesting that P2RX1 plays a role in the inflammatory response and may be a target for therapeutic intervention (Wang2021Targeting).

In acetaminophen-induced liver injury (AILI), P2RX1 deficiency has been shown to protect against early stages of liver damage by inhibiting cell death and promoting inflammation resolution. This protective effect is linked to the inhibition of the STING-TBK1-P65 signaling pathway, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for liver injury (Yu2023P2rx1).

## Interactions
P2RX1, a purinergic receptor, is involved in various interactions that influence physiological processes. It is primarily expressed on polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and platelets, where it plays a crucial role in thrombosis and fibrin generation. The receptor is activated by ATP, leading to PMN activation characterized by increased intracellular calcium mobilization and the release of neutrophil elastase, which promotes coagulation (Darbousset2014P2X1). P2RX1 is the only ATP receptor on platelets, and its activation enhances platelet aggregation and activation, which are essential for thrombus formation (Darbousset2014P2X1).

In the context of renal ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI), P2RX1 interacts with neutrophils and platelets to promote the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). This interaction is facilitated by P2RX1-induced glycolysis in platelets, leading to ATP release, which activates neutrophil P2RX1 receptors and supports NETs formation (Zhuang2021Targeting). The receptor's role in these interactions highlights its importance in mediating inflammatory responses and influencing mitochondrial dynamics in renal IRI (Zhuang2021Targeting).

These interactions underscore the potential of P2RX1 as a therapeutic target in conditions involving thrombosis and inflammation, such as renal IRI and acute pancreatitis (Wang2021P2RX1Involved).
