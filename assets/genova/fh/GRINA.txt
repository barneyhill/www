# GRINA

## Overview
The GRINA gene encodes the protein known as Glutamate Ionotropic Receptor NMDA Type Subunit Associated Protein 1, which is a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes. This protein is primarily categorized as a transmembrane protein due to its localization in cellular membranes such as the Golgi apparatus, endosomes, and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). GRINA plays a critical role in calcium homeostasis by modulating calcium release from the ER, which is essential for cell survival and function. It interacts with inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) to regulate calcium-mediated signaling pathways, thereby influencing processes such as apoptosis and cellular stress responses. Additionally, GRINA is implicated in neural communication through its involvement in glutamate receptor signaling, and it has been associated with various clinical conditions, including cancer, schizophrenia, and osteoarthritis (RojasRivera2012TMBIM3GRINA; JiménezGonzález2019Deciphering; Garcia‐Quintanilla2016Extraintestinal).

## Function
The GRINA gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function. It is primarily involved in calcium homeostasis within cells, modulating calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cytosol, which is essential for cell survival. This regulation is mediated through its interaction with the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP3R), where GRINA, along with TMBIM6, negatively regulates ER calcium release, thereby reducing calcium-mediated cell death (JiménezGonzález2019Deciphering; Garcia‐Quintanilla2016Extraintestinal).

GRINA is located in the Golgi apparatus, endosomes, and the ER, where it plays roles in endosome-to-Golgi retrieval and maintaining Golgi integrity. In the ER, it helps prevent apoptosis by modulating calcium homeostasis (JiménezGonzález2019Deciphering). The protein is also expressed in the plasma membrane, where it adjusts voltage-gated calcium channels, and has been observed in nucleoli fibrillar centers, suggesting a role in ribosome synthesis and assembly (JiménezGonzález2019Deciphering).

GRINA's expression is upregulated under ER stress conditions, which helps reduce inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate levels, indicating its importance in stress response and cellular survival (Garcia‐Quintanilla2016Extraintestinal). It is also involved in glutamate receptor signaling in neurons, which is significant for neural communication (Garcia‐Quintanilla2016Extraintestinal).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the GRINA gene, also known as TMBIM3, have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. GRINA is upregulated in various cancers, including breast, colorectal, and gastric cancer. Its regulation is mediated by the c-Myc oncogene, and knockdown of GRINA affects the expression of proteins involved in apoptosis and cell cycle regulation, suggesting a role in cancer progression (JiménezGonzález2019Deciphering).

In neurological disorders, GRINA is linked to schizophrenia and celiac disease. Patients with schizophrenia have elevated inflammation and antibodies against gliadin and GRINA, indicating a potential connection between GRINA and these conditions (JiménezGonzález2019Deciphering). GRINA's interaction with the 33-mer gliadin peptide may contribute to the generation of anti-GRINA antibodies, affecting its function and linking it to extraintestinal manifestations of celiac disease (Garcia‐Quintanilla2016Extraintestinal).

GRINA is also associated with osteoarthritis, where it shows reduced expression in affected cartilage. Methylation changes in GRINA may influence its expression, contributing to osteoarthritis risk (Rice2019Prioritization). Additionally, GRINA is involved in the regulation of ER calcium homeostasis and apoptosis, with its expression providing protection against ER stress-induced apoptosis (RojasRivera2012TMBIM3GRINA).

## Interactions
GRINA, also known as Glutamate Receptor Ionotropic NMDA-Associated Protein 1, participates in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It interacts with IP3 receptors (IP3R3 and IP3R1) to regulate ER stress and calcium homeostasis, working synergistically with pro-survival proteins like TMBIM6, Bcl-2, and Bcl-XL (JiménezGonzález2019Deciphering). GRINA also interacts with the domain IV of the CaV2.2 α1 subunit, affecting calcium channel modulation (JiménezGonzález2019Deciphering).

GRINA is involved in vesicular trafficking, particularly in endosome-to-Golgi retrieval, and interacts with proteins like Gb3 synthase, redirecting it to the lysosome for degradation (JiménezGonzález2019Deciphering). It also interacts with TRAF2, a cytosolic protein with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, influencing anti-apoptotic signaling pathways (JiménezGonzález2019Deciphering).

In the nucleus, GRINA interacts with Karyopherin β1 (KPNB1) and Calmodulin (CaM), suggesting its potential nuclear localization and involvement in RNA processing and regulation (JiménezGonzález2019Deciphering). GRINA has been localized in the nucleolus, where it may play a role in ribosome biogenesis (JiménezGonzález2019Deciphering). The presence of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) in GRINA facilitates its interactions with various binding partners, enhancing its role in cellular processes (JiménezGonzález2019Deciphering).
