# MBD3L4

## Overview
MBD3L4 is a gene that encodes the protein methyl-CpG binding domain protein 3 like 4, which is part of the MBD3L family. This family is characterized by its interaction with the Nucleosome Remodeling Deacetylase (NuRD) complex, a key player in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. Unlike other methyl-CpG binding domain proteins, MBD3L4 lacks the typical CpG-binding domain, allowing it to modulate the function of the NuRD complex by potentially replacing other components such as MBD2 or MBD3. This unique interaction suggests a role for MBD3L4 in antagonizing transcriptional repression, thereby influencing gene expression. The protein's involvement in the regulation of DUX4 expression is particularly significant in the context of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), highlighting its potential clinical relevance (Campbell2018NuRD).

## Interactions
MBD3L4 is part of the MBD3L family, which interacts with the Nucleosome Remodeling Deacetylase (NuRD) complex. MBD3L4 and other MBD3L proteins can replace MBD2 or MBD3 in the NuRD complex, although they lack the CpG-binding domain typical of other MBD proteins. This replacement can antagonize the transcriptional repression mediated by the NuRD complex, potentially by preventing its recruitment to DNA targets (Campbell2018NuRD). The interaction of MBD3L proteins with the NuRD complex highlights their role in modulating gene expression through chromatin remodeling (Campbell2018NuRD).

The study by Campbell et al. suggests that the DUX4-mediated induction of MBD3L proteins, including MBD3L4, might amplify DUX4 expression within a nucleus or facilitate the internuclear spreading of DUX4 in multinucleated myotubes. This indicates a potential role for MBD3L4 in the regulation of DUX4 expression, which is crucial in the context of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) (Campbell2018NuRD). The interaction between MBD3L4 and the NuRD complex is significant in understanding the mechanisms of chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation in FSHD (Campbell2018NuRD).
