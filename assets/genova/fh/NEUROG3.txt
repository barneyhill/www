# NEUROG3

## Overview
NEUROG3, or neurogenin 3, is a gene that encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor known as neurogenin 3. This protein is pivotal in the development of endocrine cells within the pancreas and intestine, playing a crucial role in the differentiation of insulin-secreting beta cells and enteroendocrine cells (EECs) (Zhang2019A; Li2021Reduced). Neurogenin 3 functions by binding to E-box motifs in DNA as a heterodimer with E-proteins, thereby activating the transcription of genes essential for endocrine cell specification (Zhang2019A). The activity of neurogenin 3 is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its stability and transcriptional activity (Azzarelli2017Multisite; Krentz2017Phosphorylation). Mutations in NEUROG3 can lead to significant clinical conditions, including congenital malabsorptive diarrhea and various forms of diabetes, due to impaired endocrine cell development (Wang2006Mutant; RubioCabezas2011Permanent).

## Structure
NEUROG3 (neurogenin 3) is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor essential for the development of endocrine cells in the pancreas and intestine. The primary structure of NEUROG3 includes a conserved bHLH domain, which is crucial for DNA binding and dimerization with E-proteins such as E47 (Zhang2019A). This domain allows NEUROG3 to bind to E-box motifs in the DNA, facilitating the transcription of target genes involved in endocrine cell specification (Zhang2019A).

Post-translational modifications of NEUROG3, particularly phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating its stability and function. Phosphorylation occurs at multiple serine-proline sites, which are targeted by cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) (Azzarelli2017Multisite). Specific phosphorylation sites, such as S183, are critical for NEUROG3's degradation and are linked to its cell cycle-dependent regulation (Krentz2017Phosphorylation). The phosphorylation status of NEUROG3 affects its transcriptional activity and stability, with unphosphorylated forms showing enhanced activity in promoting endocrine differentiation (Azzarelli2017Multisite).

Mutations in NEUROG3 can impact its ability to form heterodimers and bind DNA, affecting its function in endocrine cell development (Zhang2019A). These structural and functional characteristics underscore the importance of NEUROG3's molecular structure in its role as a transcription factor.

## Function
NEUROG3 (neurogenin 3) is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor that plays a critical role in the development of endocrine cells in the human pancreas and intestine. In healthy human cells, NEUROG3 is essential for the specification of endocrine cells, including insulin-secreting beta cells in the pancreas and enteroendocrine cells (EECs) in the intestine (Zhang2019A; Li2021Reduced). NEUROG3 functions by regulating target genes that encode other transcription factors such as NeuroD1, Nkx2-2, Pax4, Arx, Rfx6, and Nkx6-1, which are crucial for endocrine cell differentiation (Zhang2019A).

NEUROG3 operates primarily in the nucleus, where it binds to a core E-box motif as a heterodimer with E-proteins like E47, acting as a transcriptional activator. This interaction recruits coactivators such as p300-CBP and PCAF to activate downstream targets, promoting endocrine cell specification (Zhang2019A). The gene's activity is tightly regulated, as its expression must occur at specific developmental stages to ensure proper cell differentiation (Zhang2019A).

In the intestine, NEUROG3 is transiently expressed in early secretory progenitors, initiating EEC differentiation. The gene dosage of NEUROG3 is crucial, with higher dosages promoting EEC lineage commitment (Li2021Reduced). The absence or mutation of NEUROG3 results in the loss of pancreatic and intestinal endocrine cells, leading to conditions such as diabetes and malabsorptive diarrhea (Zhang2019A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NEUROG3 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting the development of enteroendocrine cells in the intestine and endocrine cells in the pancreas. One of the main conditions linked to NEUROG3 mutations is congenital malabsorptive diarrhea, characterized by severe diarrhea and a lack of intestinal enteroendocrine cells (EECs) (GermánDíaz2017A; Wang2006Mutant). This condition, also known as enteric anendocrinosis, results from recessively inherited mutations in NEUROG3, leading to significant gastrointestinal dysfunction (Azab2020Enteric).

NEUROG3 mutations can also lead to diabetes. Some mutations result in neonatal diabetes, while others cause childhood-onset diabetes. The variability in diabetes onset is due to the specific effects of each mutation on NEUROG3's function (Zhang2019A; RubioCabezas2011Permanent). For instance, certain mutations like E28X and L135P are associated with permanent neonatal diabetes and severe malabsorptive diarrhea (RubioCabezas2011Permanent).

The impact of NEUROG3 mutations varies depending on the tissue. In the intestine, NEUROG3 is inherently unstable, making intestinal endocrine cell development more sensitive to mutations, which often results in a complete loss of function (Zhang2019A).

## Interactions
NEUROG3 (neurogenin 3) is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in the development of endocrine cells, particularly in the pancreas and intestine. It interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids to regulate gene expression and cell differentiation. NEUROG3 forms heterodimers with E-proteins such as E47, which is essential for its ability to bind to E-box sequences in DNA and activate transcription of target genes (Zhang2019A; Krentz2017Phosphorylation). This interaction is crucial for NEUROG3's function in transcriptional activation and cell cycle arrest (Krentz2017Phosphorylation).

Mutations in NEUROG3 can affect its ability to form complexes with E47 and bind DNA, impacting its function in endocrine cell formation. For example, the R107S mutation in NEUROG3 can form a NEUROG3-E47-DNA complex but has decreased affinity for E47, affecting heterodimerization (Zhang2019A). NEUROG3 also interacts with the promoter regions of genes such as CDKN1A/p21 CIP1, directly regulating their expression to mediate cell cycle exit (SolorzanoVargas2019The). These interactions highlight NEUROG3's role in integrating multiple signaling pathways to control cell cycle dynamics and differentiation.
