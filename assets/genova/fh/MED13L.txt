# MED13L

## Overview
The MED13L gene encodes the protein mediator complex subunit 13L, which is a component of the Mediator complex, a critical transcriptional coactivator involved in the regulation of gene expression. This protein is part of the CDK8 kinase module within the Mediator complex, which can modulate transcription by either repressing or stimulating it, thereby playing a pivotal role in various cellular processes (Hamada2023MED13L; Sardar2018Analysis). MED13L is widely expressed in human tissues, including the brain, heart, and central nervous system, where it is essential for development and synaptic functions (Siavrienė2023Molecular). The gene's mutations are linked to MED13L haploinsufficiency syndrome, characterized by intellectual disability, speech impairment, and distinctive facial features, among other clinical manifestations (Smol2018MED13Lrelated; Poot2019Mutations).

## Function
The MED13L gene encodes a subunit of the Mediator complex, a crucial transcriptional coactivator that regulates RNA polymerase II-transcribed genes. This complex acts as a molecular bridge between transcription factors and the transcription machinery, playing a significant role in gene expression regulation (Hamada2023MED13L). MED13L is part of the CDK8 kinase module of the Mediator complex, which can modulate transcription by either repressing or stimulating it (Sardar2018Analysis).

In healthy human cells, MED13L is involved in several signaling pathways, including Wnt, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and retinoblastoma (Rb)/E2F pathways, which are important for cell proliferation, differentiation, and immune function (Sardar2018Analysis). MED13L is also implicated in maintaining mitochondrial integrity by anchoring cyclin C in the nucleus, preventing its release into the cytoplasm, which is crucial for mitochondrial function and energy metabolism (Chang2022Aberrant).

MED13L is widely expressed in human tissues, including the brain, heart, and central nervous system, where it plays a critical role in development and synaptic functions (Siavrienė2023Molecular). It is localized in the cell nucleus and synapses, impacting synaptic functions and dendritic development of neurons (Siavrienė2023Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MED13L gene are associated with a condition known as MED13L haploinsufficiency syndrome, which is characterized by a range of developmental and clinical features. These include moderate to severe intellectual disability, speech impairment, and distinctive facial dysmorphic traits such as a broad forehead, low-set ears, and a bulbous nose (Smol2018MED13Lrelated; Poot2019Mutations). Additional symptoms may include muscle hypotonia, ataxia, autism spectrum disorder, seizures, and congenital heart defects (Siavrienė2023Molecular; Poot2019Mutations).

The syndrome is caused by various types of mutations in the MED13L gene, including missense mutations, protein-truncating variants, and intragenic deletions. Missense mutations often result in more severe phenotypes, including epilepsy and severe language impairment (Smol2018MED13Lrelated; Yi2020Report). The gene's role in the Mediator complex, which is crucial for transcription regulation, suggests that disruptions in MED13L can lead to global disturbances in transcriptional regulation, contributing to the clinical manifestations observed in affected individuals (Bessenyei2021MED13Lrelated).

Alterations in MED13L expression can also impact cardiac development and function, with some patients exhibiting congenital heart defects (Yi2020Report; Tørring2019Is). The gene's involvement in neural crest induction and its expression in heart and brain tissues further underscore its significance in developmental processes (Siavrienė2023Molecular; JiménezRomero2018Language).

## Interactions
MED13L is a component of the CDK8 module within the Mediator complex, playing a crucial role in transcription regulation. It interacts with the Fbw7 ubiquitin ligase, which targets MED13L for degradation. This interaction is dependent on a Cdc4 phosphodegron (CPD) motif centered on threonine 326 (T326) in MED13L. Mutations at this site, such as T326A, disrupt the binding to Fbw7, highlighting the importance of this phosphorylation site for the interaction (Davis2013The).

The interaction between MED13L and Fbw7 is significant for regulating the association of the CDK8 module with the Mediator complex. Loss of Fbw7 results in increased association of CDK8 module components, including MED13L, with the Mediator, suggesting that Fbw7-mediated degradation of MED13L can disrupt this association (Davis2013The). This regulation is crucial for controlling transcription initiation and reinitiation, as MED13L, along with MED13, serves as a bridge linking the CDK8 module to the Mediator core (Davis2013The).

Fbw7 specifically ubiquitylates MED13L, promoting its turnover and reducing its half-life, as demonstrated by metabolic pulse-chase experiments. This process is specific to MED13L and does not affect other Mediator components like MED1 and MED14 (Davis2013The).
