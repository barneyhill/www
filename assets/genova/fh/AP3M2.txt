# AP3M2

## Overview
The AP3M2 gene encodes the adaptor-related protein complex 3 subunit mu 2, a critical component of the adaptor protein complex 3 (AP-3). This protein complex is integral to the intracellular trafficking and sorting of membrane proteins, particularly within neuronal and lysosomal pathways. As a cytoplasmic protein associated with the Golgi apparatus and endosomal membranes, AP-3 plays a pivotal role in the biogenesis of synaptic vesicles and lysosome-related organelles, influencing processes such as pigmentation, immune response, and neuronal function (NewellLitwa2007Neuronal). The AP3M2 gene's involvement in these cellular processes underscores its significance in both normal physiological functions and various pathological conditions, including its role as an oncogene or antioncogene in different cancer types (Jin2024Prognostic).

## Structure


## Function
The AP3M2 gene encodes a subunit of the adaptor protein complex 3 (AP-3), which is crucial for the sorting and trafficking of membrane proteins within cells. AP-3 is involved in the generation of synaptic vesicles and lysosome-related organelles, playing a significant role in the targeting of lysosomal, melanosomal, and synaptic vesicle-specific membrane proteins (NewellLitwa2007Neuronal). In neuronal cells, AP-3 is essential for the proper targeting of synaptic vesicle proteins, ensuring their delivery to presynaptic terminals, which is vital for synaptic function (NewellLitwa2007Neuronal). The AP-3 complex also participates in the biogenesis of synaptic vesicles from presynaptic endosomes, operating alongside the AP-2 pathway, and is particularly important under conditions of high-frequency stimulation (NewellLitwa2007Neuronal).

AP-3's role extends to the sorting of proteins into synaptic vesicle pathways or lysosomal pathways, as demonstrated by its involvement in the correct routing of the synaptic vesicle protein ZnT3. In the absence of AP-3, ZnT3 is misrouted to lysosomes, highlighting the complex's importance in maintaining synaptic vesicle protein levels (NewellLitwa2007Neuronal). The AP-3 complex is active in the cytoplasm, particularly associated with the Golgi apparatus and endosomal membranes, where it influences processes like pigmentation, immune response, and neuronal function (NewellLitwa2007Neuronal).

## Clinical Significance
The AP3M2 gene is clinically significant due to its association with various diseases and conditions. It is linked to Farber Lipogranulomatosis and Generalized Epilepsy With Febrile Seizures Plus (Jin2024Prognostic). In the context of cancer, AP3M2 acts as an oncogene in several types, including breast invasive carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, stomach adenocarcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, rectum adenocarcinoma, esophageal carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, and lung squamous cell carcinoma. Conversely, it functions as an antioncogene in glioblastoma multiforme, kidney chromophobe, and thyroid carcinoma (Jin2024Prognostic).

Alterations in AP3M2 expression levels have prognostic implications in colorectal cancers. Enhanced expression predicts poor prognosis in colon adenocarcinoma but not in rectal adenocarcinoma (Jin2024Prognostic). The gene is also associated with resistance to chemotherapy drugs like oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil, potentially through the NF-κB signaling pathway and its interaction with ABCG2 (Jin2024Prognostic). Additionally, AP3M2 is implicated in alcohol preference and withdrawal behaviors, with genetic variations affecting its expression in response to chronic ethanol exposure (Bubier2014Identification). These findings highlight AP3M2's role in both cancer progression and substance use disorders.
