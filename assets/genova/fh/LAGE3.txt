# LAGE3

## Overview
LAGE3 is a gene that encodes the protein L antigen family member 3, which is a crucial component of the KEOPS complex, a multi-protein assembly involved in essential cellular processes such as tRNA modification, telomere maintenance, and transcriptional regulation. The LAGE3 protein is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and functions in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, playing a significant role in cell growth and proliferation. It is particularly important for the structural integrity and stability of the KEOPS complex, facilitating interactions with other subunits like OSGEP. LAGE3's involvement in these fundamental cellular activities underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and genome stability (Costessi2012The; Braun2017Mutations).

## Function
LAGE3 is a component of the KEOPS complex, which is involved in several critical cellular processes, including the post-transcriptional modification of tRNA. Specifically, LAGE3 plays a role in the biosynthesis of N6-threonylcarbamoyl adenosine (t6A), a modification essential for accurate mRNA translation and protein synthesis (Costessi2012The; Braun2017Mutations). The KEOPS complex, which includes LAGE3, is highly conserved across species and is implicated in telomere maintenance, transcriptional regulation, and genome stability (Costessi2012The; Braun2017Mutations).

LAGE3 is expressed ubiquitously in human tissues and is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to cell growth and proliferation (Costessi2012The; Braun2017Mutations). Within the KEOPS complex, LAGE3 is crucial for the structural integrity and stability of the complex, enhancing the stability of other subunits like OSGEP and facilitating the formation of higher-order structures (Costessi2012The). The protein's interaction with other components of the complex is essential for its function in maintaining normal cell proliferation and genome maintenance (Braun2017Mutations). These activities underscore LAGE3's role in fundamental cellular processes and its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the LAGE3 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly various forms of cancer and Galloway-Mowat syndrome (GAMOS). In colorectal cancer (CRC), LAGE3 is upregulated and associated with poor survival outcomes, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic marker. Its expression negatively correlates with immune cell infiltration, indicating that targeting LAGE3 could enhance immune response in CRC (Dong2020Upregulation). In papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), LAGE3 expression correlates with tumor mutation burden and microsatellite instability, and its silencing reduces tumorigenic properties, indicating its role in cancer progression (Dong2021Identification).

LAGE3 is also upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where it promotes tumor progression through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Ras/RAF/MAPK pathways. Its expression is linked to poor prognosis, and knockdown studies suggest it could be a therapeutic target (Li2022Correlation; Chen2022Analysis). In breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer, LAGE3 is associated with aggressive cancer features and poor prognosis (Dong2021Upregulation).

Mutations in LAGE3 are linked to GAMOS2, a subtype of GAMOS, characterized by nephrotic syndrome and microcephaly. These mutations can lead to a non-early lethal form of the syndrome, with neurological and kidney phenotypes (Braun2017Mutations; Chen2023Diagnosis).

## Interactions
LAGE3 is a component of the human EKC/KEOPS complex, which is involved in various cellular processes such as telomere maintenance and transcriptional regulation. Within this complex, LAGE3 interacts with other subunits including OSGEP, TP53RK, and TPRKB, forming a linear configuration of LAGE3-OSGEP-TP53RK-TPRKB. LAGE3 enhances the stability of OSGEP, indicating that OSGEP's stability is dependent on its interaction with LAGE3 (Costessi2012The).

LAGE3 also plays a role in the recruitment of Cullin2 ubiquitin ligases to the EKC complex through its interaction with PRAME, a human tumor antigen. PRAME associates with LAGE3 and OSGEP independently of an intact BC-box, and its knockdown reduces interactions between EKC subunits and Cullin2 ligase components, suggesting that PRAME is crucial for recruiting these ligases to the EKC complex (Costessi2012The).

In addition to its role in the EKC/KEOPS complex, LAGE3 has been identified as interacting with the ORFV024 protein from the Orf virus, which may play a role in modulating immune responses. This interaction was confirmed through various assays, including co-immunoprecipitation (Long2018Identification).
