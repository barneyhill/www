# NISCH

## Overview
The NISCH gene encodes the protein nischarin, a cytosolic scaffolding protein that plays a crucial role in cellular signaling and trafficking pathways. Nischarin is involved in regulating cell migration, maintaining cellular architecture, and influencing metabolic processes. It interacts with various cellular components, including integrins and Rho-family GTPases, to modulate the actin cytoskeleton and cell adhesion dynamics, which are vital for processes such as cancer metastasis and tissue development (Nguyen2022Nischarin; Alahari2000Nischarin). Additionally, nischarin is implicated in metabolic regulation, affecting mitochondrial function and energy production (Nguyen2022Nischarin). The protein's role as a tumor suppressor in cancers, particularly breast cancer, underscores its clinical significance, as alterations in NISCH expression are linked to disease progression and patient outcomes (Maziveyi2015Breast; Baranwal2011Molecular).

## Structure
Nischarin, encoded by the NISCH gene, is a cytosolic protein that interacts with various cellular components and is involved in multiple signaling pathways. The protein has four isoforms resulting from alternative splicing, with isoform 1 being the full-length version (Maziveyi2015Breast). Nischarin contains several functional domains, including a Phox (PX) domain at the N-terminus, which is crucial for plasma membrane and vesicular targeting, and a coiled-coil domain essential for endosomal targeting (Maziveyi2015Breast). The C-terminal domain (CTD) of Nischarin is involved in binding to Rab GTPases, such as Rab14, Rab4A, Rab9A, and Rac1, indicating its role in vesicle trafficking (Kuijl2013Rac).

Nischarin undergoes post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination at specific lysine residues and phosphorylation at several serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues, which may regulate its activity (Maziveyi2015Breast). The protein's interaction with phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) in endosomes is mediated by its PX domain, and it can 'lock' Rab4 and Rab9 in a GTP-bound state on the membrane (Kuijl2013Rac). These structural features and modifications highlight Nischarin's role as a scaffolding protein involved in cellular signaling and trafficking pathways.

## Function
Nischarin (NISCH) is a cytosolic scaffolding protein that plays a significant role in regulating cell migration and maintaining cellular architecture. It interacts with the integrin α5 subunit, inhibiting cell migration by affecting pathways regulated by Rho-family GTPases, particularly Rac GTPase. This interaction influences the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, leading to changes in cell shape and adhesion dynamics (Alahari2000Nischarin). Nischarin's role in inhibiting cell migration is crucial in the context of cancer, as it can potentially prevent metastasis by reducing cell motility (Nguyen2022Nischarin).

In addition to its role in cell migration, Nischarin is involved in metabolic regulation. It influences oxidative metabolism and ATP production, with its deletion leading to reduced basal respiration and ATP-linked respiration. This suggests that Nischarin is important for efficient mitochondrial function and energy production (Nguyen2022Nischarin). Nischarin also regulates the expression of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, indicating its broader role in metabolic homeostasis (Nguyen2022Nischarin). These functions highlight Nischarin's importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis, impacting processes such as tissue development and energy balance.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NISCH gene, also known as nischarin, have been implicated in several psychiatric disorders and cancers. In psychiatric conditions, increased expression of NISCH is associated with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression. This overexpression affects dendritic spine morphogenesis, leading to changes in spine density that may impair cognitive functions such as learning and memory. The psychiatric risk allele rs2251219, linked to NISCH, is associated with mood and psychotic disorders, cognitive impairments, and lower intelligence scores (Yang2023Identification).

In cancer, particularly breast cancer, NISCH acts as a tumor suppressor. Its expression is often reduced in breast cancer tissues compared to normal tissues, with lower levels correlating with more advanced tumor stages and decreased patient survival. This reduction in expression is frequently due to loss of heterozygosity at the NISCH locus and promoter hypermethylation. Restoring NISCH expression in breast cancer cell lines has been shown to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis, highlighting its role in regulating cell migration and invasion (Maziveyi2015Breast; Baranwal2011Molecular).

## Interactions
Nischarin (NISCH) is a protein that engages in various interactions with other proteins, influencing cellular processes such as migration and adhesion. It specifically interacts with the integrin α5 subunit, binding to its cytoplasmic domain, which plays a significant role in inhibiting cell migration. This interaction is crucial for regulating cell motility, particularly in α5β1-dependent migration on fibronectin (ALAHARI2004A; Alahari2000Nischarin).

Nischarin also interacts with PAK1 and PAK2, kinases involved in cytoskeletal dynamics and cell migration. These interactions occur in various cell types, including neurons, where Nischarin regulates PAK activity, affecting neurite outgrowth (Ding2015Inhibition). In breast cancer cells, Nischarin's interaction with PAK1 and LIMK1 is associated with the regulation of focal adhesion and invadopodia formation, impacting cell migration and invasion (Maziveyi2018Nischarin).

Additionally, Nischarin interacts with other proteins such as LKB1 and Rac1, further influencing cell motility and metabolic processes (Nguyen2022Nischarin). These interactions highlight Nischarin's role as a multifunctional protein involved in various signaling pathways that regulate cellular behavior.
