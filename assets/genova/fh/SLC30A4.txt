# SLC30A4

## Overview
SLC30A4 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 30 member 4, commonly referred to as ZnT4. ZnT4 is a zinc transporter protein that belongs to the Cation Diffusion Facilitator (CDF) family, characterized by its six membrane-spanning domains. This transmembrane protein is primarily involved in the transport of zinc ions from the cytoplasm into intracellular vesicles, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular zinc homeostasis (Bourouba2018Investigation; Seve2004In). ZnT4 is expressed in various tissues, with notable roles in the mammary gland during lactation and in immune cells such as macrophages, where it contributes to zinc regulation and immune function (McCormick2016ZnT4; Kambe2015The). The protein's activity is essential for the proper functioning of zinc-dependent enzymes and processes, highlighting its significance in both cellular and physiological contexts (Kukic2013Zincdependent).

## Structure
The SLC30A4 gene encodes the ZnT4 protein, a member of the ZnT family of zinc transporters. ZnT4 is characterized by a predicted structure that includes six membrane-spanning domains, which are typical of the Cation Diffusion Facilitator (CDF) family. These domains facilitate the transport of zinc ions across cellular membranes (Bourouba2018Investigation; Seve2004In). Unlike other members of the ZnT family, ZnT4 features a serine-rich intracellular loop between helices IV and V, rather than the more common histidine-rich loop found in other ZnT proteins (Bourouba2018Investigation).

ZnT4 is localized in the membrane of intracellular vesicles, particularly in polarized enterocytes, where it plays a role in zinc efflux from the cytoplasm into organelles (Seve2004In; Kukic2013Zincdependent). The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the testis, where it is found at the highest levels (Seve2004In). In the context of lactation, ZnT4 is expressed in human breast epithelial cells, although its expression does not differ significantly between lactating and resting states (Seve2004In). The protein's activity and expression are crucial for maintaining zinc homeostasis within cells.

## Function
The SLC30A4 gene encodes the zinc transporter protein ZnT4, which plays a crucial role in maintaining zinc homeostasis within cells. ZnT4 is primarily involved in transporting zinc ions from the cytoplasm into intracellular vesicles, such as lysosomes, endosomes, and the trans-Golgi network (TGN) (Kukic2013Zincdependent; Kambe2015The). This transport is essential for the metallation and functional stability of zinc-dependent proteins, including enzymes like carbonic anhydrase VI, which are critical for various cellular processes (McCormick2012ZnT4).

In mammary epithelial cells, ZnT4 is vital for zinc accumulation in the Golgi apparatus, which supports the secretion of zinc into milk, a process crucial for infant nutrition (McCormick2016ZnT4). ZnT4's activity is also linked to the proper functioning of the mammary gland during lactation, as evidenced by the 'lethal milk' phenotype observed in ZnT4-null mice, which exhibit impaired milk secretion and mammary gland development (McCormick2016ZnT4).

ZnT4's role extends to immune function, where its expression in macrophages is upregulated by GM-CSF, potentially enhancing antimicrobial activity by mobilizing zinc into the Golgi apparatus (Kambe2015The). This highlights ZnT4's importance in both cellular zinc regulation and broader physiological processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SLC30A4 gene, also known as ZnT4, have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In gastric cancer, SLC30A4 expression is downregulated in cancerous tissues compared to non-cancerous tissues. This downregulation is associated with unfavorable overall survival in HER2-negative gastric cancer patients, suggesting a potential prognostic significance (Guo2020Comprehensive). Despite its expression levels being clinically significant, genetic mutations in SLC30A4 do not significantly impact overall survival or disease-free survival in gastric cancer patients (Guo2020Comprehensive).

In the context of neural tube defects (NTDs), a common polymorphism in the SLC30A4 gene (915 T-C) has been associated with an increased risk of these congenital malformations. This highlights the gene's role in zinc homeostasis, which is crucial for neural tube closure during embryonic development (Bourouba2018Investigation).

Additionally, in TRPML1-deficient cells, SLC30A4 is involved in zinc transport and its dysfunction can lead to lysosomal enlargement due to zinc accumulation. This suggests that SLC30A4 plays a critical role in maintaining cellular zinc homeostasis and could be a target for addressing transition metal toxicity (Kukic2013Zincdependent).

## Interactions
SLC30A4, also known as ZnT4, is involved in several interactions that are crucial for its function in zinc homeostasis. ZnT4 interacts with TRPML1, a lysosomal ion channel, to regulate zinc translocation between the cytoplasm and lysosomes. This interaction is important for maintaining zinc balance within lysosomes, as TRPML1 provides a zinc leak pathway, and ZnT4 helps in vesicular zinc accumulation (Kukic2013Zincdependent).

ZnT4 also plays a role in the activation of zinc-requiring ectoenzymes during the secretory process. It can functionally substitute for other zinc transporters, such as ZnT5-ZnT6 heterodimers or ZnT7 homodimers, in activating specific enzymes like carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) (Kambe2017Understanding). This highlights ZnT4's involvement in secretory pathways and its role in zinc secretion into breast milk.

In macrophages, SLC30A4 is part of the zinc regulatory machinery, where it colocalizes with LAMP1, indicating its role in transporting zinc into phagolysosomes. This interaction is crucial for zinc homeostasis and pathogen zinc uptake, affecting macrophage activation and immune response (Subramanian2016IL4).
