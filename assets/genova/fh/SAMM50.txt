# SAMM50

## Overview
SAMM50 is a gene that encodes the SAMM50 sorting and assembly machinery component, a transmembrane protein located in the mitochondrial outer membrane. This protein is integral to the sorting and assembly machinery (SAM) complex, which is essential for the integration and assembly of β-barrel proteins into the mitochondrial outer membrane, thereby maintaining mitochondrial structure and function (Ott2012Sam50). SAMM50 interacts with components of the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) complex, forming a critical axis that facilitates the assembly of the mitochondrial intermembrane space bridging (MIB) supercomplex. This interaction is vital for maintaining mitochondrial morphology and cristae architecture, which are crucial for energy production and cellular respiration (Ott2012Sam50; Tang2019Sam50–Mic19–Mic60). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its association with diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and cardiac hypertrophy, where alterations in SAMM50 expression can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction (Xu2021Samm50; Zhao2023SAMM50rs2073082).

## Structure
SAMM50 is a mitochondrial outer membrane protein that plays a crucial role in the sorting and assembly machinery (SAM) necessary for assembling β-barrel proteins. The primary structure of SAMM50 includes sequences that allow for N-myristoylation, a post-translational modification essential for its proper targeting to mitochondria (Utsumi2018Identification). This modification is critical for the interaction between SAMM50 and other proteins, such as MIC19, within the mitochondrial intermembrane space bridging (MIB) complex (Utsumi2018Identification).

The secondary structure of SAMM50 is characterized by a β-barrel configuration, which is integral to its function as a membrane protein (Utsumi2018Identification). The tertiary structure involves the folding of this β-barrel, allowing SAMM50 to integrate into the mitochondrial outer membrane effectively.

In terms of quaternary structure, SAMM50 interacts with other proteins, including MIC19 and MIC25, to form the MIB complex, which is essential for maintaining mitochondrial structure and function (Utsumi2018Identification). SAMM50 also interacts with components of the MICOS complex, such as Mitofilin and CHCHD6, to sustain cristae structure (Ding2015Mitofilin). These interactions highlight the importance of SAMM50 in mitochondrial architecture and protein import processes.

## Function
The SAMM50 gene encodes the Sam50 protein, a crucial component of the sorting and assembly machinery (SAM) complex located in the mitochondrial outer membrane. Sam50 is essential for the integration and assembly of β-barrel proteins into the outer membrane, which is vital for maintaining mitochondrial structure and function (Ott2012Sam50). It interacts with components of the MICOS complex, such as Mic19 and Mic60, forming the Sam50-Mic19-Mic60 axis. This axis is critical for connecting the SAM and MICOS complexes, facilitating the assembly of the mitochondrial intermembrane space bridging (MIB) supercomplex, which mediates contact between the mitochondrial outer and inner membranes (Tang2019Sam50–Mic19–Mic60).

Sam50 plays a significant role in maintaining mitochondrial morphology and cristae architecture. It acts as an anchoring point in the outer membrane, guiding the formation of crista junctions, which are essential for mitochondrial energy production and organization (Tang2019Sam50–Mic19–Mic60). Depletion of Sam50 leads to fragmented mitochondria, loss of cristae structure, and reduced ATP production, highlighting its importance in mitochondrial function (Ott2012Sam50). Additionally, Sam50 is involved in the assembly and stability of respiratory complexes, which are crucial for cellular respiration (Ott2012Sam50). The protein's activity is localized to the mitochondrial outer membrane, where it plays a pivotal role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function (Utsumi2018Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SAMM50 gene have been linked to several diseases, particularly non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Polymorphisms such as rs2073082, rs738491, and rs3761472 in the SAMM50 gene are associated with increased susceptibility to NAFLD. Carriers of the rs2073082 G allele and rs738491 T allele have a higher risk of developing NAFLD, with the rs738491 T allele and rs3761472 G allele also linked to increased liver stiffness, indicating potential fibrosis (Zhao2023SAMM50rs2073082). These genetic variations may promote mitochondrial dysfunction by reducing SAMM50 expression, contributing to NAFLD development (Zhao2023SAMM50rs2073082).

In pediatric populations, SAMM50, along with other genes like PNPLA3 and TM6SF2, has been associated with NAFLD, although its effects are more pronounced in overweight children (Lee2021Effects). In a Japanese population, a 4-SNP haplotype in the SAMM50 gene was strongly associated with NAFLD, suggesting a significant role in the disease's pathogenesis (Kitamoto2013Genomewide).

SAMM50 also plays a role in cardiac hypertrophy. Its downregulation is observed in hypertrophic hearts, and its overexpression can exacerbate hypertrophy by inhibiting mitophagy, a process crucial for mitochondrial quality control (Xu2021Samm50).

## Interactions
SAMM50 is a mitochondrial outer membrane protein that participates in various interactions crucial for mitochondrial function and dynamics. It is a component of the mitochondrial intermembrane space bridging (MIB) complex, which includes mitofilin and CHCHD3. This complex is essential for maintaining the structure of mitochondrial cristae and the assembly of respiratory complexes (Ott2012Sam50). SAMM50 interacts with proteins involved in mitochondrial dynamics, such as mitofusins (MFN1 and MFN2) and mitochondrial fission factor (MFF), but not with Prohibitin2 (PHB2) (Jian2018Sam50; Park2022SAMM50).

SAMM50 also interacts with PINK1, a key player in the PINK1-Parkin-mediated mitophagy pathway. This interaction is crucial for regulating mitophagy and mitochondrial quality control (Xu2021Samm50; Jian2018Sam50). SAMM50's role in mitophagy is further supported by its interaction with Atg8-family proteins through a canonical LIR motif and with SQSTM1/p62, facilitating basal piecemeal mitophagy (Abudu2021SAMM50).

In the context of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) turnover, SAMM50 interacts with BAK, a protein involved in mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, which is crucial for mtDNA release (Sen2022Mitochondrial). These interactions highlight SAMM50's multifaceted role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function.
