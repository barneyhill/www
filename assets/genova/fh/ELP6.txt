# ELP6

## Overview
The ELP6 gene encodes the protein elongator acetyltransferase complex subunit 6, which is a component of the Elongator complex, a multi-subunit assembly involved in various cellular processes. This complex is highly conserved across eukaryotic species and plays a pivotal role in transcriptional elongation, tRNA modification, and histone acetylation, thereby influencing gene expression and protein synthesis (Kojic2016The). ELP6, specifically, is part of the accessory sub-complex ELP456, which forms a heterohexameric, ring-like structure with ELP4 and ELP5. This structure is crucial for binding to the anti-codon loop of tRNAs and maintaining ATPase activity, which is essential for tRNA binding and release (Kojic2016The). The protein is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, contributing to cellular processes such as stress response and development, and is vital for maintaining translational fidelity and cellular homeostasis (Kojic2016The). The functional integrity of the Elongator complex is dependent on the presence of ELP6, underscoring its importance in cellular function (Kojic2016The).

## Function
ELP6 is a subunit of the Elongator complex, a multi-subunit complex highly conserved in eukaryotes, which plays a crucial role in various cellular processes. The Elongator complex is involved in transcriptional elongation, tRNA modification, and histone acetylation, contributing to the regulation of gene expression and protein synthesis (Kojic2016The). ELP6, along with ELP4 and ELP5, forms part of the accessory sub-complex Elp456, which assembles into a heterohexameric, ring-like structure. This structure binds to the anti-codon loop of tRNAs and preserves ATPase activity, likely controlling tRNA binding and release (Kojic2016The).

In healthy human cells, ELP6 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it contributes to cellular processes such as stress response and development. The Elongator complex, including ELP6, is implicated in maintaining translational fidelity through tRNA modifications, which are essential for proper protein translation and cell division (Kojic2016The). The complex also plays a role in cytoplasmic kinase signaling, exocytosis, and cytoskeletal organization, which are vital for neurodevelopment and cellular homeostasis (Kojic2016The). The functional integrity of the Elongator complex is compromised in the absence of any of its subunits, highlighting the importance of ELP6 in maintaining its activity (Kojic2016The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ELP6 gene are associated with neurodegenerative conditions and ataxia-like behavior, particularly in the context of cerebellar ataxias. A specific mutation, Elp6L126Q, has been identified in mice, leading to Purkinje neuron degeneration and an ataxia-like phenotype known as the "wobbly" mouse. This mutation results in the destabilization of the Elongator complex, impairing its function in translation regulation, which causes protein misfolding, proteotoxic stress, and neuronal death (Kojic2018Elongator).

The Elp6L126Q mutation specifically affects the Elp456 subcomplex, crucial for tRNA binding and modification, leading to reduced tRNA modification levels. This reduction is linked to impaired protein synthesis and folding, resulting in protein misfolding, aggregation, ER stress, and apoptosis (Kojic2018Elongator). The mutation is recessive, as heterozygous mice do not exhibit the phenotype, and compound heterozygous mice display a more severe and rapidly progressing phenotype (Kojic2018Elongator).

The study also highlights the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, with treatments targeting NLRP3 showing delayed onset of ataxia and reduced neurodegeneration (Kojic2018Elongator).

## Interactions
ELP6, a subunit of the Elongator complex, participates in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It is part of the accessory sub-complex ELP456, which forms a heterohexameric, ring-like structure with ELP4 and ELP5. This structure specifically binds to the anti-codon loop of transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and maintains ATPase activity, which likely regulates tRNA binding and release (Kojic2016The). ELP6 acts as a bridging component in the formation of a heterotrimer with ELP4 and ELP5, facilitating the assembly of the Elongator complex (Jun2024Evolutionary).

In Arabidopsis, ELP6 interacts directly with ELP4 and ELP5, forming a trimeric structure that is evolutionarily conserved with yeast, despite low sequence homology. This interaction is supported by structural analyses and yeast two-hybrid experiments (Jun2024Evolutionary). The ELP456 sub-complex, including ELP6, is involved in tRNA modification, particularly at the wobble uridine position, which is crucial for mRNA translation elongation (Jun2024Evolutionary). These interactions highlight the role of ELP6 in the structural integrity and functional activity of the Elongator complex.
