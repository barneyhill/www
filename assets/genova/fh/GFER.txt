# GFER

## Overview
The GFER gene encodes the protein known as the augmenter of liver regeneration (ALR), which is a FAD-dependent sulfhydryl oxidase. This protein plays a pivotal role in mitochondrial function, particularly within the mitochondrial intermembrane space assembly (MIA) pathway, where it facilitates the import and oxidative folding of cysteine-rich proteins. ALR is essential for maintaining mitochondrial morphology, distribution, and respiration, thereby supporting cellular redox homeostasis and viability. It is involved in the biogenesis of complex IV of the respiratory chain by aiding in the import of the copper chaperone COX17. The protein's interactions, including those with Mia40 and cytochrome c, are crucial for mitochondrial integrity and function. Disruptions in GFER, whether through genetic mutations or environmental factors like Bisphenol A, can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and are associated with various clinical conditions, including developmental delays and cardiac issues (Banci2012An; Lim2021Risk; Goyal2021BisphenolA).

## Structure


## Function
The GFER gene, also known as the augmenter of liver regeneration (ALR), encodes a protein that plays a critical role in mitochondrial function and cellular redox homeostasis. It is involved in the mitochondrial intermembrane space assembly (MIA) pathway, which is essential for the import and oxidative folding of cysteine-rich proteins into the mitochondria. GFER functions as a FAD-dependent sulfhydryl oxidase, facilitating the formation of disulfide bonds necessary for the proper folding and import of mitochondrial proteins (Goyal2021BisphenolA).

In healthy cells, GFER is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial morphology, distribution, and respiration, which are vital for cell survival. It supports the biogenesis of complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) by importing the copper chaperone COX17, a component of the respiratory chain (Goyal2021BisphenolA). The protein's activity in the mitochondrial intermembrane space is essential for the import of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins, which are required for forming new mitochondria and replacing misfolded or mutated proteins (Goyal2021BisphenolA).

GFER also plays a role in cell proliferation and survival, as its proper function prevents mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and apoptosis, thereby contributing to cellular viability and organismal health (Goyal2021BisphenolA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GFER gene are associated with a range of clinical conditions, primarily due to its critical role in mitochondrial function. Variants in GFER can lead to infantile onset congenital cataract, sensorineural hearing loss, and developmental delay, often accompanied by multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions (Saneto2020Mitochondrial). These mutations can also result in global developmental delay, short stature, failure to thrive, congenital cataract, and nonsyndromic microcephaly (Erickson2014The).

In adults, GFER mutations have been linked to mild left ventricular dysfunction, expanding the phenotypic spectrum of GFER-related mitochondrial disease to include cardiac manifestations (Lim2021Risk). Some patients with recessive GFER variants have developed left ventricular hypertrophy and electrical conduction abnormalities, such as bifascicular block and left bundle branch block (Lim2021Risk).

A specific case involving a heterozygous pathogenic missense variant in trans with a heterozygous protein-truncating variant in the GFER gene led to exercise intolerance, elevated lactate, and cataracts, supporting the pathogenicity of these variants (Yépez2022Clinical). These findings underscore the gene's significant impact on both developmental and sensory impairments, as well as its potential role in cardiac health.

## Interactions
GFER, also known as augmenter of liver regeneration (ALR), is involved in several protein interactions crucial for mitochondrial function. It interacts with Mia40 (CHCHD4), forming part of the mitochondrial intermembrane space assembly (MIA) pathway. This interaction is essential for the oxidative folding and import of cysteine-rich proteins into the mitochondrial intermembrane space. GFER facilitates the re-oxidation of Mia40, enabling it to continue its role in protein import (Banci2012An; Erdogan2016Mitochondrial; Muzzioli2024The).

GFER also interacts with cytochrome c (cyt c) as part of a disulfide relay system, transferring electrons to cyt c, which is crucial for the electron transport chain (Banci2012An). Additionally, GFER has been shown to interact with the apoptosis-associated protein BNIPL, suggesting a role in cell proliferation and apoptosis regulation (Shen2003The).

Environmental factors such as Bisphenol A (BPA) can disrupt GFER's interactions, particularly with Mia40, affecting mitochondrial protein import and leading to mitochondrial dysfunction (Goyal2021BisphenolA). These interactions highlight GFER's critical role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and cellular health.
