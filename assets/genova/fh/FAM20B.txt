# FAM20B

## Overview
FAM20B is a gene that encodes the FAM20B glycosaminoglycan xylosylkinase, a type II transmembrane protein that functions as a kinase. This enzyme is primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus and plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), such as heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, by phosphorylating the xylose residue in the GAG-protein linkage region of proteoglycans (Huang2021Novel; Koike2009FAM20B). The phosphorylation activity of FAM20B is essential for the proper assembly and regulation of GAG chains, influencing cellular processes like adhesion, signaling, and extracellular matrix organization, which are critical for tissue development and maintenance (Huang2021Novel). Mutations or dysregulation of FAM20B have been associated with developmental disorders and skeletal abnormalities, highlighting its clinical significance (Liu2019Lack).

## Function
FAM20B encodes a kinase that plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) by phosphorylating the xylose residue in the GAG-protein linkage region of proteoglycans. This phosphorylation occurs at the C-2 position of the xylose residue within the tetrasaccharide sequence, which is essential for the proper assembly of GAG chains such as heparan sulfate (HS) and chondroitin sulfate (CS) (Huang2021Novel; Koike2009FAM20B). The phosphorylation by FAM20B is a crucial step that facilitates the subsequent addition of sugar residues, determining the type of GAG synthesized (Huang2021Novel).

FAM20B is a type II transmembrane protein localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it colocalizes with Golgi markers, indicating its activity occurs in this cellular compartment (Koike2009FAM20B). The enzyme's activity influences the number of GAG chains rather than their elongation, affecting the total amount and sulfation profile of GAGs synthesized in cells (Koike2009FAM20B). This regulation is vital for maintaining normal cellular functions, including cell adhesion, signaling, and extracellular matrix organization, which are crucial for tissue development and maintenance (Huang2021Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the FAM20B gene have been implicated in various developmental disorders and skeletal abnormalities. FAM20B encodes a kinase that is crucial for the post-translational modification of glycosaminoglycans, which are vital for cell signaling and maintaining structural integrity. Disruptions in FAM20B function can lead to defects in proteoglycan biosynthesis and extracellular matrix formation, contributing to developmental anomalies (Liu2019Lack).

In a study investigating the genetic basis of mesiodens, a type of supernumerary tooth, the T allele of FAM20B was suggested to be associated with susceptibility to having two mesiodens, although no significant differences in polymorphisms were found between affected individuals and controls. This indicates a potential, albeit not definitive, role of FAM20B in tooth development and related dental conditions (Liu2019Lack). The study also highlighted that inactivation of FAM20B in the dental epithelium of mice results in supernumerary maxillary and mandibular incisors, further suggesting its involvement in dental development (Liu2019Lack). These findings underscore the need for further research to clarify the clinical significance of FAM20B mutations in human dental anomalies.

## Interactions
FAM20B is a kinase that plays a crucial role in the phosphorylation of xylose residues in the glycosaminoglycan-protein linkage region of proteoglycans. This phosphorylation is essential for the regulation of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chain production, including chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate. FAM20B interacts with enzymes such as galactosyltransferase II (GalT-II) and xylosyltransferase I (XylT-1) in the GAG biosynthesis pathway, indicating functional interactions that are critical for proteoglycan production (Koike2009FAM20B).

FAM20B is localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it functions as a xylose kinase, suggesting its involvement in a linear pathway with XylT-1 for cartilage matrix production and inhibition of perichondral bone formation during endochondral ossification (Koike2009FAM20B). Although specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, the presence of conserved sequences in the FAM20 family suggests potential roles in protein interactions (Nalbant2005FAM20:). FAM20B's activity is crucial for the activation of GalT-II, as it primes GalT-II activity, which is necessary for the elongation of GAG chains (Zhang2018Structure).
