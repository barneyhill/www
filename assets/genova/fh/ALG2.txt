# ALG2

## Overview
ALG2 is a gene that encodes the enzyme alpha-1,3/1,6-mannosyltransferase, a crucial component in the process of N-linked glycosylation within the endoplasmic reticulum. This enzyme is categorized as a mannosyltransferase, which plays a pivotal role in the early steps of glycoprotein biosynthesis by facilitating the transfer of mannose residues to lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursors. The ALG2 protein forms oligomeric complexes with other mannosyltransferases, such as ALG1 and ALG11, to enhance the efficiency of glycosylation reactions (Gao2004Physical). Beyond its primary function in glycosylation, ALG2 is involved in various cellular processes through its interactions with proteins like ALIX and PATL1, indicating its broader role in cellular signaling and mRNA processing (Sun2015ALG2; Osugi2012Identification). Mutations in the ALG2 gene are linked to congenital disorders of glycosylation, leading to a spectrum of clinical manifestations, including neurological and muscular symptoms (Papazoglu2021Mass; Monies2014Clinical).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ALG2 gene are associated with congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), specifically ALG2-CDG, which is a rare autosomal recessive disorder. This condition is characterized by a range of symptoms, including neurological involvement, convulsive syndrome, axial hypotonia, and mental and motor regression. Patients may also experience thrombohemorrhagic alterations and immunological issues, such as increased susceptibility to infections and autoimmune complications (Papazoglu2021Mass). 

ALG2 mutations can lead to a myasthenic/myopathic syndrome, manifesting as congenital myopathy with a limb-girdle pattern of muscle weakness. This condition is marked by significant phenotypic variation, with symptoms ranging from severe multisystemic disorders to those primarily affecting neuromuscular transmission and muscle weakness (Monies2014Clinical). Muscle biopsies from affected individuals often show myopathic changes, including ragged red fibers and mitochondrial proliferation, indicative of mitochondrial myopathy (Monies2014Clinical).

The ALG2 gene encodes an α1,3-mannosyltransferase involved in glycosylation, and mutations disrupt the addition of mannose residues on lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursors. This disruption leads to defective N-glycan assembly, resulting in a type I CDG defect (Papazoglu2021Mass).

## Interactions
ALG2, also known as alpha-1,3/1,6-mannosyltransferase, is involved in several protein interactions within the endoplasmic reticulum. It forms oligomeric complexes with other mannosyltransferases, specifically ALG1 and ALG11, which are crucial for the early steps of N-linked glycosylation. ALG1 acts as a central component in these complexes, interacting with both ALG2 and ALG11, although ALG2 and ALG11 do not directly interact with each other (Gao2004Physical). These interactions facilitate the catalytic processes by limiting substrate diffusion distances, enhancing the efficiency of glycosylation reactions (Gao2004Physical).

ALG2 also interacts with various cellular proteins in a calcium-dependent manner. It binds to ALIX, a protein involved in cellular signaling pathways, through specific PxY motifs. This interaction is crucial for modulating ALIX's conformation and membrane association, particularly in response to epidermal growth factor stimulation (Sun2015ALG2). Additionally, ALG2 interacts with PATL1, a protein associated with mRNA processing, suggesting a role in RNA-related processes (Osugi2012Identification). These interactions highlight ALG2's involvement in diverse cellular functions beyond glycosylation.
