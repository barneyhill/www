# DYDC1

## Overview
The DYDC1 gene encodes the protein DPY30 domain containing 1, which is involved in various cellular processes. While the specific functions of the DYDC1-encoded protein are not fully elucidated, it is categorized as a protein with a DPY30 domain, suggesting a potential role in chromatin modification and gene expression regulation. The gene is located on chromosome 10q22.3 and has been studied in the context of several medical conditions, including myofibrillar myopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, and Dupuytren's disease. Research has also highlighted its potential involvement in respiratory outcomes following preterm birth and craniofacial abnormalities associated with Kabuki Syndrome (Kuhl2008Myofibrillar; Topa2017On; Hamvas2018Exome; Shih2010GenomeWide).

## Clinical Significance
The DYDC1 gene has been implicated in several medical conditions through various genetic studies. In a Swedish family, DYDC1 was identified as a candidate gene in a study investigating myofibrillar myopathy (MFM) combined with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC7). Although no disease-causing mutations were found in the coding regions, the study suggested that regulatory mutations might contribute to the diverse clinical phenotypes affecting both skeletal and cardiac muscles (Kuhl2008Myofibrillar).

In the context of respiratory outcomes following preterm birth, DYDC1 was among the 345 genes identified with extremely rare variants in severely affected subjects. These variants may influence susceptibility or resilience to chronic lung disease in preterm infants (Hamvas2018Exome).

DYDC1 is also located within a copy number variation region on chromosome 10q22.3, which has been associated with Dupuytren's disease (DD). Although the clinical significance of DYDC1 in DD is not fully understood, its presence in this region suggests a potential role in the disease's development (Shih2010GenomeWide).

In a case study of Kabuki Syndrome, a 3.2 Mbp de novo deletion on chromosome 10q22.3-q23.1, including DYDC1, was noted. This deletion was associated with craniosynostosis, suggesting a possible link between DYDC1 and craniofacial abnormalities (Topa2017On).
