# KHSRP

## Overview
KHSRP, or KH-type splicing regulatory protein, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional RNA-binding protein involved in various aspects of RNA metabolism, including mRNA splicing, stability, and degradation. The protein, characterized by its four KH (K-homology) domains, plays a critical role in binding RNA and is involved in the regulation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level (Kung2016Control; Min1997A). KHSRP is implicated in the biogenesis of microRNAs and the decay of mRNAs, influencing cellular processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation (Trabucchi2009The; Linker2005Involvement). Its interactions with various protein complexes and RNA elements underscore its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential involvement in disease pathogenesis, including cancer and neuromuscular disorders (Briata2015Diverse).

## Structure
KHSRP, also known as KH-type splicing regulatory protein, is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein characterized by its four KH (K-homology) domains, which are essential for its RNA-binding activity (Kung2016Control; Min1997A). These domains are arranged in a central region of the protein and are known for their role in binding RNA, with the KH domains exhibiting a conserved structure that includes an antiparallel β-sheet packed against three α-helices (Min1997A). The KH domains in KHSRP contain variations of the conserved GKXG motif, with some domains featuring GRXG motifs (Min1997A).

The protein also has a proline-glycine-rich N-terminal region, which includes a nuclear localization signal (NLS) necessary for its nuclear localization (Hall2004Differentiationinduced). The C-terminal domain is rich in proline, glycine, alanine, and glutamine, and contains degenerate repeats thought to be involved in protein-protein interactions (Hall2004Differentiationinduced; Min1997A). Post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination at specific lysine residues, play a role in regulating KHSRP's function, particularly in the context of viral infections (Kung2016Control).

KHSRP is known to have several splice variant isoforms, which may differ in their functional roles (Briata2015Diverse). These structural features and modifications enable KHSRP to participate in various cellular processes, including mRNA decay and splicing regulation.

## Function
KHSRP (KH-type splicing regulatory protein) is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein involved in various aspects of RNA metabolism, including mRNA splicing, stability, and degradation. In the context of mRNA splicing, KHSRP interacts with components of the spliceosome, such as SF3B1, to promote the splicing of pre-mRNA. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing, influencing the expression of genes like EGFR and CDC25A (Li2024KHSRP).

KHSRP also plays a significant role in the biogenesis of a subset of microRNAs (miRNAs) by binding to the terminal loops of miRNA precursors. This binding facilitates the recruitment of processing complexes, enhancing the maturation of specific miRNAs, which in turn affects cellular processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation (Trabucchi2009The).

In addition to its role in splicing and miRNA processing, KHSRP is involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA stability. It binds to AU-rich elements in the 3'-untranslated regions of target mRNAs, promoting their degradation. This activity is crucial for the regulation of gene expression in response to extracellular stimuli (Linker2005Involvement).

## Clinical Significance
KHSRP (KH-type splicing regulatory protein) plays a significant role in various diseases due to its involvement in RNA metabolism and gene expression regulation. In cancer, KHSRP mutations, particularly in the KH domains, have been linked to cancer pathogenesis, with a notable frequency in small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) (Briata2015Diverse; Tong2016KHtype). Increased KHSRP expression is associated with advanced tumor stages in SCLC and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), promoting tumor growth and metastasis (Yan2019RNAbinding; Tong2016KHtype). In NSCLC, KHSRP interacts with HNRNPC, influencing tumorigenesis through the IFN-α-JAK-p-STAT1 signaling pathway (Yan2019RNAbinding).

KHSRP also impacts neuromuscular disorders, with its deficiency affecting miR-206 maturation, crucial for muscle regeneration in conditions like spinal muscular atrophy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Briata2015Diverse). In metabolic disorders, KHSRP deletion in mice leads to increased lipolysis and altered circadian regulation, suggesting potential therapeutic targets for obesity and liver steatosis (Briata2015Diverse). Additionally, KHSRP's role in miRNA biogenesis and its SUMOylation status are linked to tumorigenesis, affecting the maturation of tumor-suppressive miRNAs like the let-7 family (Yuan2017SUMO1).

## Interactions
KHSRP (KH-type splicing regulatory protein) is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in RNA metabolism. It is a component of the Drosha-DGCR8 multiprotein complex, which is essential for miRNA biogenesis. KHSRP interacts with this complex to facilitate the processing of primary miRNAs into precursor miRNAs. However, SUMOylation at lysine 87 can inhibit this interaction, affecting miRNA biogenesis (Yuan2017SUMO1).

KHSRP also interacts with AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3' untranslated regions of mRNAs, recruiting the RNA exosome and other nucleases to promote mRNA decay (Briata2015Diverse). It forms ribonucleoprotein complexes with hnRNPA1, influencing the splicing of pre-mRNAs during epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (Puppo2016miRNA-Mediated).

In the context of viral infections, KHSRP acts as a negative IRES trans-acting factor (ITAF) by interacting with the IRES in the 5'UTR of enterovirus 71 (EV71), downregulating IRES-dependent translation. This interaction is modulated by ubiquitination, which affects KHSRP's regulatory function (Kung2016Control). KHSRP's interaction with KLHL12, a component of the cullin 3-based ubiquitin-protein E3 ligase complex, is crucial for its ubiquitination and subsequent regulatory roles (Kung2016Control).
