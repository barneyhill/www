# GSG1L2

## Overview
GSG1L2 is a gene that encodes the protein GSG1 like 2, which is a member of the GSG1 family. This protein is predicted to be an integral component of the plasma membrane, primarily involved in the regulation of ion channels and synaptic transmission (Da2022A). As a transmembrane protein, GSG1 like 2 is implicated in modulating the activity of AMPA receptors, which are essential for synaptic plasticity and neuronal communication (Da2022A). The protein is predominantly active in the synaptic membranes of neurons, suggesting its role in synaptic connectivity and signaling (Qiao2023Deciphering). Although the gene is tolerant to loss-of-function variants and its absence does not lead to significant pathological conditions, its disruption has been observed in certain chromosomal translocations, though it is not the primary focus in studies of related genetic disorders (Da2022A).

## Function
The GSG1L2 gene encodes a protein that is predicted to be an integral component of the plasma membrane, playing a role in cellular processes such as ion channel regulation and synaptic transmission (Da2022A). Although the specific function of GSG1L2 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, it is part of the GSG1 family, which is associated with modulating the activity of AMPA receptors. These receptors are crucial for synaptic plasticity and neuronal communication, suggesting that GSG1L2 may have a role in these processes (Da2022A). The protein is typically active in the synaptic membranes of neurons, indicating its involvement in synaptic connectivity and signaling (Qiao2023Deciphering). Despite its predicted role, no known disease-related biological function has been ascribed to GSG1L2, and it is considered tolerant to loss-of-function variants, implying that its absence does not lead to significant pathological conditions (Da2022A). The gene's disruption in certain chromosomal translocations has been noted, but it is not considered the primary focus in studies of related genetic disorders (Da2022A).
