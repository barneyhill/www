# GPKOW

## Overview
The GPKOW gene encodes a nuclear RNA-binding protein characterized by the presence of a G-patch domain and KOW motifs, which are integral to its function in RNA processing. The protein, known as G-patch domain and KOW motifs protein, is involved in critical cellular processes such as RNA splicing, editing, and polyadenylation. It serves as a core component of the spliceosome, a complex essential for RNA splicing, and is regulated by protein kinase A (PKA) through phosphorylation. The GPKOW protein's interactions with various proteins and nucleic acids underscore its role in RNA metabolism, including RNA stability, transport, and decay. Mutations in the GPKOW gene have been associated with severe developmental disorders and intellectual disabilities, highlighting its clinical significance (Carroll2017Variant; Helsmoortel2014Challenges; Aksaas2011Gpatch).

## Structure
The GPKOW protein is characterized by the presence of a G-patch domain and two KOW motifs. The G-patch domain, approximately 48 amino acids long, is involved in RNA binding and processing. It is characterized by a consensus sequence with six highly conserved glycines, although in GPKOW, the fifth glycine is substituted with a glutamine (Aksaas2011Gpatch). The KOW motifs, spanning amino acids 240-267 and 415-442, are known for their role in ribosomal protein interactions and contain alternating hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues that form two β-strands (Aksaas2011Gpatch). These motifs are structurally similar to the Tudor protein-protein interaction motif, suggesting a potential role in nucleic acid binding (Aksaas2011Gpatch).

The protein has a theoretical molecular mass of 52.5 kDa, which increases to 57.5 kDa when tagged with a V5 tag (Aksaas2011Gpatch). GPKOW is regulated by protein kinase A (PKA) and contains two PKA phosphorylation sites at serine 27 (S27) and threonine 316 (T316), which are important for its RNA-binding properties (Aksaas2011Gpatch). The protein is localized in the nucleus, with a punctuate distribution, and is absent from the cytoplasm and nucleoli (Aksaas2011Gpatch).

## Function
The GPKOW gene encodes a nuclear RNA-binding protein that plays a crucial role in RNA processing within healthy human cells. This protein contains a G-patch domain and KOW motifs, which facilitate its binding to single-stranded RNA, DNA, and proteins, suggesting its involvement in various RNA processing activities, including splicing, editing, and polyadenylation (Aksaas2011Gpatch). GPKOW is a core component of the spliceosome, a complex essential for RNA splicing, and is critical for maintaining proper RNA splicing, which is vital for normal cellular function and development (Carroll2017Variant).

The protein is regulated by protein kinase A (PKA) through phosphorylation, which affects its RNA-binding ability. Specifically, phosphorylation at serine 27 (S27) and threonine 316 (T316) by PKA modulates its function, although its nuclear localization is independent of this phosphorylation (Aksaas2011Gpatch). GPKOW is localized in the nucleus, where it binds RNA in vivo, indicating its active role in RNA metabolism, including RNA stability, splicing, transport, and decay (Aksaas2011Gpatch). The gene's function is essential for survival, as demonstrated by its involvement in critical developmental processes (Carroll2017Variant).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GPKOW gene have been linked to severe developmental disorders, particularly a male-lethal condition characterized by microcephaly and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). This condition is associated with a specific variant, c.331+5G4A, which disrupts normal splicing of GPKOW pre-mRNAs. The disruption leads to reduced levels of wild-type mRNA and protein, and the presence of a truncated protein that may exert a dominant negative effect. The condition is X-linked, and while some carrier females exhibit skewed X chromosome inactivation, this does not fully mitigate the variant's effects (Carroll2017Variant).

The GPKOW gene has also been implicated in intellectual disabilities. In a study using whole-exome sequencing, variants in GPKOW were identified in patients with intellectual disabilities, although the specific contribution of these variants to the phenotype remains unclear (Helsmoortel2014Challenges). Additionally, GPKOW has been mentioned in bioinformatics analyses as a hub gene in networks related to cancer, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, although its direct role in these conditions has not been detailed (p&gt; Tu2019&lt; Bioinformatics). These findings underscore the gene's potential involvement in various disorders, necessitating further research to elucidate its clinical significance.

## Interactions
GPKOW, a nuclear RNA-binding protein, interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in RNA processing. It contains a G-patch domain and KOW motifs, which facilitate its interactions. GPKOW is known to interact with the catalytic subunit Cβ2 of protein kinase A (PKA), although this interaction is inconsistent and does not involve other PKA subunits like Cα1, Cβ1, or Cβ4 (Aksaas2011Gpatch). The interaction with Cβ2 suggests a specific regulatory role in RNA processing, potentially influencing pre-mRNA splicing (Aksaas2011Gpatch).

GPKOW also interacts with RNA helicases, particularly DHX16, as confirmed by immunoprecipitation experiments. This interaction is thought to regulate DHX16's function in splicing, similar to interactions observed in yeast homologues (Memet2024Insights). The G-patch domain of GPKOW is crucial for these interactions, although it does not significantly stimulate DHX16's ATPase activity, indicating that other regions of GPKOW may contribute to this interaction (Memet2024Insights).

Additionally, GPKOW is part of the spliceosome complex, associating with factors specific to the pre-catalytic B complex, which suggests a role in the splicing cycle (Gaspar2021Interactome). These interactions highlight GPKOW's involvement in RNA splicing and processing through its binding with various proteins and nucleic acids.
