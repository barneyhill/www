# CCR6

## Overview
CCR6 (C-C motif chemokine receptor 6) is a gene that encodes a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in the immune system's regulation and response. The protein product of the CCR6 gene, also named C-C motif chemokine receptor 6, is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains, which are typical of GPCRs, and plays a pivotal role in mediating chemotaxis of immune cells such as dendritic cells, T cells, and B cells. This receptor is unique in its specific interaction with the chemokine ligand CCL20, facilitating the migration of immune cells to sites of inflammation or infection, particularly in mucosal tissues like the gut and lungs (Schutyser2003The; Ito2011CCR6). The CCR6-CCL20 axis is implicated in various physiological processes, including mucosal immunity and lymphoid tissue organization, and is also associated with several pathological conditions, such as autoimmune diseases and cancer, making it a significant target for therapeutic interventions (Meitei2021CCR6CCL20; Ranasinghe2018Modulation).

## Structure
CCR6 (C-C motif chemokine receptor 6) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a canonical topology of seven transmembrane (7TM) α-helices, three extracellular loops (ECLs), and three intracellular loops (ICLs), with a short helix (helix 8) parallel to the membrane (Wasilko2020Structural). The primary structure of CCR6 includes four highly conserved cysteine residues, with Cys118 and Cys197 forming a crucial disulfide bond in the first and second extracellular loops, essential for proper folding and receptor function (Ai2002Mutating; Schutyser2003The). The N terminus of CCR6 is connected to ECL3 via a conserved disulfide bond, providing additional binding surface for its ligand, CCL20 (Wasilko2020Structural).

CCR6 undergoes post-translational modifications, including potential N-linked glycosylation at sites in the NH2-terminal domain and the first and third extracellular loops (Schutyser2003The). The receptor also contains a conserved intracellular DRY motif in the second intracellular loop, which is typical for GPCRs and plays a role in receptor activation (Schutyser2003The). The tertiary structure involves the folding of the helices into a three-dimensional conformation, forming a transmembrane domain that is crucial for its function as a receptor.

## Function
CCR6 (C-C motif chemokine receptor 6) is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a crucial role in the immune system by mediating the chemotaxis of immune cells. It is primarily expressed on various immune cells, including dendritic cells, T cells, and B cells, and is involved in guiding these cells to sites of inflammation or infection (Schutyser2003The). CCR6 is unique in its ability to bind specifically to the chemokine ligand CCL20, also known as liver and activation-regulated chemokine (LARC) or macrophage inflammatory protein-3α (MIP-3α) (Schutyser2003The; Ito2011CCR6).

In healthy human cells, CCR6 is involved in mucosal immunity, particularly in the gut and lung, where it facilitates the recruitment of dendritic cells and T-helper cells to mucosal tissues (Ito2011CCR6). It plays a significant role in organizing lymphoid tissues and maintaining immune cell populations at critical sites for immune surveillance, such as Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes (Ito2011CCR6). CCR6 is also important for the migration of effector memory T cells to the intestinal mucosa and skin, contributing to immune responses in these tissues (Kondo2006Functional).

## Clinical Significance
The CCR6 gene is clinically significant due to its involvement in various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Alterations in CCR6 expression or its interaction with its ligand CCL20 are linked to conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In RA, CCR6 is crucial for the recruitment of Th17 cells to inflamed joints, contributing to joint inflammation and damage (Meitei2021CCR6CCL20; Hirota2007Preferential). Polymorphisms in the CCR6 gene are associated with increased expression and are linked to RA pathology (Comerford2010An).

In psoriasis, the CCR6-CCL20 axis facilitates the migration of inflammatory T cells to the skin, exacerbating skin inflammation (Ranasinghe2018Modulation). The axis is also implicated in IBD, where it plays a role in recruiting leukocytes to the inflamed gut mucosa, contributing to mucosal inflammation (Comerford2010An; Meitei2021CCR6CCL20).

CCR6 is also involved in cancer progression, particularly in cancer stem cells, where its overexpression is linked to tumorigenesis and immunosuppression (Ranasinghe2018Modulation). The CCR6/CCL20 axis is a potential therapeutic target in these diseases, with studies exploring its inhibition to reduce disease severity and inflammation (Meitei2021CCR6CCL20).

## Interactions
CCR6 interacts primarily with its high-affinity ligand CCL20, forming a unique chemokine-receptor pair. The binding of CCL20 to CCR6 occurs in a shallow extracellular pocket, which is distinct from the deeper binding sites seen in other GPCRs. This interaction involves the three extracellular loops of CCR6, with specific amino acids playing crucial roles in the binding process (Wasilko2020Structural; GómezMelero2023CCR6). The N terminus of CCL20 forms a hydrogen bond and a salt bridge with specific residues on CCR6, which is essential for receptor activation (Wasilko2020Structural).

CCR6 also forms a complex with the G protein, particularly the Go protein, which is stabilized by interactions with intracellular loops of CCR6. This complex formation is crucial for signal transduction following CCL20 binding (Wasilko2020Structural). Additionally, CCR6 can interact with β-arrestins, which are involved in receptor desensitization and internalization, leading to a G protein-independent signaling pathway (GómezMelero2023CCR6).

Human beta-defensins, such as HBD-2 and HBD-3, have been reported to interact with CCR6, although with lower affinity compared to CCL20. These interactions suggest potential alternative pathways for CCR6-mediated responses (Lee2015The).
