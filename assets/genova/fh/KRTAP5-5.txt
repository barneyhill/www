# KRTAP5-5

## Overview
KRTAP5-5, or keratin-associated protein 5-5, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the keratin-associated protein family, which plays a crucial role in the structural organization and function of keratin intermediate filaments. The protein encoded by KRTAP5-5 is primarily expressed in hair-related tissues, indicating its specialized function in hair structure and development (Litman2023Ancient). As a cytoskeletal protein, keratin-associated protein 5-5 is involved in maintaining cellular integrity by modulating cell motility and structural organization, which are essential for healthy cellular function (Litman2023Ancient). The protein's interactions with keratin filaments and integrins underscore its importance in cytoskeletal dynamics and its potential implications in cancer cell motility and invasion (Berens2016Keratinassociated).

## Function
KRTAP5-5 (keratin-associated protein 5-5) is involved in regulating cytoskeletal function and cell motility in healthy human cells. It plays a role in modulating cell movement and structural organization, which is crucial for maintaining cellular integrity and function (Litman2023Ancient). KRTAP5-5 is part of the M lineage grouping of keratin-associated proteins, which are primarily expressed in hair-related tissues, suggesting a specialized function in hair structure or development (Litman2023Ancient).

In terms of molecular processes, KRTAP5-5 is essential for the stability of keratin intermediate filaments. Its depletion leads to a decrease in keratin proteins, specifically KRT14 and KRT18, at both the protein and mRNA levels, indicating its critical role in keratin filament processing (Berens2016Keratinassociated). KRTAP5-5 also influences the expression and function of integrins, such as α6-integrin and β4-integrin, which are important for cell attachment to the extracellular matrix and cell motility (Berens2016Keratinassociated). These functions highlight the importance of KRTAP5-5 in maintaining the structural integrity of the keratin cytoskeleton and facilitating cell movement, which are likely relevant to its function in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
KRTAP5-5, a member of the keratin-associated protein family, has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to its role in regulating cytoskeletal function and cell motility. Alterations in the expression of KRTAP5-5 have been associated with the modulation of cell proliferation and motility, which can lead to vascular invasion, particularly in the context of mammary cancer. This suggests that KRTAP5-5 may have clinical significance in cancer biology, potentially influencing the progression of certain cancers by affecting cellular dynamics (Litman2023Ancient).

While the specific diseases directly resulting from mutations in KRTAP5-5 are not extensively detailed, the gene's involvement in broader cellular processes indicates its potential impact on various conditions. The gene's expression and interaction with other proteins are crucial for maintaining normal cellular functions, and disruptions in these interactions could contribute to pathological states. The broader role of KRTAPs in proliferation regulation across multiple cell types further underscores the potential clinical implications of KRTAP5-5 in disease contexts (Litman2023Ancient).

## Interactions
KRTAP5-5, a keratin-associated protein, plays a significant role in interacting with keratin intermediate filaments, particularly keratin 18 (KRT18). The interaction between KRTAP5-5 and KRT18 is crucial for maintaining cytoskeletal integrity and function. Knockdown of KRTAP5-5 results in a significant reduction in KRT18 mRNA expression, suggesting a functional link between these proteins (Berens2016Keratinassociated). This interaction is essential for the stability of keratin intermediate filaments, as depletion of KRTAP5-5 leads to a reduction in keratin proteins, including KRT14 and KRT18 (Berens2016Keratinassociated).

KRTAP5-5 also influences integrin signaling, particularly affecting the α6-integrin (Itga6) and β4-integrin (Itgb4), which are components of hemidesmosomes. Knockdown of KRTAP5-5 results in reduced expression of these integrins, leading to decreased hemidesmosome stability and reduced cell invasion capabilities (Berens2016Keratinassociated). This suggests that KRTAP5-5 modulates keratin assembly, impacting integrin function at the cell surface.

The interactions of KRTAP5-5 with keratin and integrins highlight its role in cytoskeletal dynamics and its potential impact on cancer cell motility and invasion (Berens2016Keratinassociated).
