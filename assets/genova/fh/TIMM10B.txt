# TIMM10B

## Overview
TIMM10B is a gene that encodes the translocase of inner mitochondrial membrane 10B (TIMM10B) protein, which is a critical component of the mitochondrial import machinery. This protein is part of the TIM22 complex, which is responsible for the translocation of multi-transmembrane domain proteins across the inner mitochondrial membrane. TIMM10B functions as a small TIM chaperone, forming a hetero-oligomeric complex with other small TIM proteins such as TIM9 and TIM10A. This complex facilitates the import and insertion of hydrophobic membrane proteins, playing a vital role in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production. Structurally, TIMM10B is characterized by a propeller-like formation with a central pore, and its function is supported by specific structural features, including disulfide bonds and a proline-induced conformational change (Valpadashi2024Structural). Understanding the role of TIMM10B is essential for elucidating the mechanisms of mitochondrial protein import and its implications in mitochondrial-related disorders.

## Structure
The TIMM10B protein is a component of the TIM22 complex in the inner mitochondrial membrane, playing a crucial role in the translocation of proteins. Structurally, TIMM10B is part of a hetero-oligomeric complex with TIM9, TIM10A, and TIM19B, where it replaces a TIM10A protein. This complex forms a propeller-like structure with a central pore, characterized by a flat base of aligned Î±-helical structures and flexible C-terminal extensions, which are essential for its function in cargo import (Valpadashi2024Structural).

The TIMM10B protein is suggested to be a homolog of the yeast Tim12 protein, serving as a docking site for small TIM chaperones. It is involved in interactions with other small TIM proteins, such as TIM9, as indicated by crosslinking data showing interaction between TIM10B (K55) and TIM9 (K81) (Valpadashi2024Structural). A notable feature of TIMM10B is a proline residue at its C-terminal end, which induces a conformational change to facilitate the release of carrier proteins to the TIM22 complex (Valpadashi2024Structural). The protein's structure is maintained by disulfide bonds, which are common post-translational modifications in small TIM proteins (Valpadashi2024Structural).

## Function
TIMM10B is a component of the TIM22 complex, a crucial part of the mitochondrial import machinery responsible for the translocation of multi-transmembrane domain proteins across the inner mitochondrial membrane. In humans, TIMM10B is proposed to be the functional homolog of the yeast Tim12 protein, serving as a docking site for the small TIM chaperone complex, although this has not been functionally verified (Valpadashi2024Structural). TIMM10B forms part of a hetero-oligomeric complex with TIM9 and TIM10A, which facilitates the release of carrier proteins to the TIM22 complex. A proline residue at the C-terminal end of TIMM10B induces a conformational change that may aid in this process (Valpadashi2024Structural).

The TIM22 complex, including TIMM10B, plays a role in guiding precursor proteins from the TOM complex to the TIM22 insertion site. TIMM10B, along with other small TIM chaperones, is implicated in the docking and transfer of precursor proteins within the TIM22 complex (Valpadashi2024Structural). This process is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production, as it ensures the proper insertion and assembly of carrier proteins into the inner mitochondrial membrane.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or dysregulation of the TIMM10B gene can significantly impact mitochondrial function, potentially leading to various mitochondrial disorders. These disorders arise due to impaired protein translocation across the inner mitochondrial membrane, a critical process for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function. Alterations in TIMM10B expression or its interactions have been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. This is likely due to the essential role of mitochondria in neuronal health and energy metabolism, where any disruption can contribute to the progression of such diseases. Additionally, metabolic syndromes may also be linked to changes in TIMM10B activity, as mitochondria are central to metabolic processes. The impaired import of mitochondrial proteins due to TIMM10B dysfunction can lead to metabolic imbalances, further exacerbating these conditions. Understanding the clinical significance of TIMM10B mutations and dysregulation is crucial for developing targeted therapies for related mitochondrial and metabolic disorders.

## Interactions
TIMM10B is a component of the small TIM chaperone complex in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, where it plays a crucial role in the import and insertion of hydrophobic membrane proteins into the inner mitochondrial membrane. TIMM10B is part of a hexameric complex that includes TIM9 and TIM10A, with TIMM10B replacing one TIM10A protein in the complex. This hexameric structure interacts with the TIM22 complex, a key player in the translocation of multi-transmembrane domain proteins (Valpadashi2024Structural).

The TIM22 complex includes subunits such as TIM22, TIM29, and AGK, with TIM29 providing a docking site for the small TIM hexamer complex. TIMM10B interacts with TIM9, as evidenced by a crosslink between TIMM10B (K55) and TIM9 (K81), although this interaction was observed in only one experimental replicate (Valpadashi2024Structural). TIMM10B is suggested to be a functional homolog of the yeast Tim12 protein, serving as a docking site for small TIM chaperones (Valpadashi2024Structural).

The flexibility and adaptability of the small TIM complex, including TIMM10B, are essential for efficient cargo import, as they facilitate the release of carrier proteins to the TIM22 complex (Valpadashi2024Structural).
