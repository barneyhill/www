# CTR9

## Overview
CTR9 is a gene that encodes the CTR9 homolog, a critical component of the PAF1 complex (PAF1C), which is involved in transcriptional regulation and chromatin modification. The CTR9 protein functions as a scaffold within the PAF1C, facilitating the assembly and interaction of various subunits, including PAF1, LEO1, CDC73, and RTF1, with RNA polymerase II. This interaction is essential for transcription elongation and the regulation of histone modifications, such as H2B ubiquitination and H3 methylation (Xie2018Paf1). Structurally, CTR9 is characterized by multiple tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which form a superhelical structure crucial for its function (Xie2018Paf1). The gene's role extends to influencing the activity of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), impacting chromatin states and gene expression (Chan2022The). Clinically, mutations in CTR9 have been linked to various cancers, including Wilms tumor and breast cancer, highlighting its significance in tumorigenesis and as a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Zeng2015Ctr9; Hanks2014Germline).

## Structure
The CTR9 protein is a key scaffold component of the PAF1 complex (PAF1C), which is involved in transcription elongation. Structurally, CTR9 contains multiple tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which are crucial for its interaction with PAF1. These TPR motifs are arranged in a right-handed superhelix, forming a concave channel that accommodates the PAF1 protein (Xie2018Paf1). The N-terminal cap of CTR9 is composed of an antiparallel β-sheet and an α0 helix, while the C-terminal cap includes the α6A helix (Xie2018Paf1).

CTR9's structure is further characterized by 12 α-helices and two β-strands at the N-terminus, with five sequential helix-turn-helix repeats exhibiting structural similarity to TPR motifs (Xie2018Paf1). The CTR9/PAF1 complex forms a 1:1 heterodimer with a molecular mass of approximately 34 kDa (Xie2018Paf1). In yeast, the Ctr9 protein forms a solenoidal structure with 21 TPRs, creating a three-circled right-handed solenoid structure (Qin2023Structural). The inner surface of Ctr9 interacts with the N-terminus of Paf1, while the outer surface interacts with other components like Cdc73 and Rtf1 (Qin2023Structural). The CTR9 protein's structural features are conserved across eukaryotic species, highlighting its essential role in the PAF1 complex assembly and function (Xie2018Paf1).

## Function
CTR9 is a crucial component of the polymerase-associated factor 1 complex (PAF1C) in humans, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation and chromatin modification. It acts as a scaffold protein, essential for the assembly and functional regulation of PAF1C, which includes subunits such as PAF1, LEO1, CDC73, and RTF1 (Xie2018Paf1). CTR9 is involved in recruiting PAF1C to the transcription machinery by binding to RNA polymerase II, facilitating transcription elongation and histone modifications, such as H2B ubiquitination and H3 methylation at specific lysine residues (Xie2018Paf1).

In addition to its role in transcription elongation, CTR9 influences the regulation of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and its associated histone modification, H3K27me3. CTR9 modulates the balance between PRC2 subtypes, affecting the distribution and intensity of H3K27me3 peaks across the genome, which are associated with repressive chromatin states (Chan2022The). CTR9's activity in the nucleus impacts gene expression, cell growth, and differentiation, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular function and identity (Chan2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CTR9 gene have been implicated in several cancers. Germline mutations in CTR9 are associated with Wilms tumor, a pediatric kidney cancer. These mutations often result in aberrant splicing or protein truncation, leading to a loss of function that suggests CTR9 acts as a tumor suppressor gene. Such mutations are rare in the general population but have been identified in familial cases of Wilms tumor, indicating a predisposition to the disease (Hanks2014Germline; Martins2018Identification).

CTR9 is also involved in breast cancer, particularly ERα-positive luminal breast cancer. High expression levels of CTR9 correlate with poor prognosis in these patients. CTR9 enhances estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) protein stability and promotes transcriptional responses, driving tumorigenesis in ERα-positive breast cancer (Zeng2015Ctr9).

In gliomas, CTR9 expression is significantly increased, correlating with aggressive tumor behavior and poor prognosis. CTR9 may activate the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, contributing to glioma cell proliferation and invasion (Xu2021CTR9‐mediated).

CTR9 is also overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where it promotes tumor progression by regulating the expression of PEG10, a gene involved in cell proliferation and metastasis (Zhang2021Transcriptional).

## Interactions
CTR9 is a key component of the PAF1 complex (Paf1C), which interacts with RNA polymerase II and other proteins to regulate transcription elongation and chromatin modifications. CTR9 forms a heterodimer with PAF1, which is essential for the assembly of the Paf1C in both yeast and humans (Xie2018Paf1). This interaction is mediated by hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions, with specific regions and residues playing crucial roles in maintaining the stability of the complex (Xie2018Paf1).

CTR9 contains tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) that form a superhelical structure, providing major contact points for WDR61, which forms a seven-bladed ß propeller structure (Francette2021The). The CTR9 trestle domain interacts with Pol II at RPB5 near downstream DNA, indicating its role in transcription regulation (Francette2021The).

CTR9 also interacts with other components of the Paf1 complex, such as CDC73, LEO1, and RTF1, forming a stable association within the complex (Squazzo2002The). These interactions are crucial for the structural integrity and function of the transcription complex, influencing gene expression regulation (Vos2020Structure).
