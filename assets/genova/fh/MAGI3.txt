# MAGI3

## Overview
MAGI3 is a gene that encodes the protein membrane-associated guanylate kinase, WW and PDZ domain containing 3, which is a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUKs) superfamily. This protein functions primarily as a scaffolding protein, playing a critical role in maintaining cell junction integrity and regulating various cellular signaling pathways, including PI3K/AKT, Wnt, and Hippo. MAGI3 is characterized by its structural domains, which include six PDZ domains, two WW domains, and a guanylate kinase (GUK) domain, facilitating its interactions with multiple proteins such as PTEN, β-catenin, and YAP1. These interactions are crucial for processes like cell signaling, junction stabilization, and tumor suppression. Alterations in MAGI3 expression or structure have been implicated in several diseases, notably various cancers and inflammatory bowel disease, underscoring its significance in cellular homeostasis and disease pathogenesis (Ni2016Premature; Kotelevets2021A; Wang2022E3).

## Structure
The MAGI3 protein is a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUKs) superfamily, specifically within the subgroup of membrane-associated guanylate kinase inverted (MAGI) proteins. Its primary structure includes six PDZ domains, two WW domains, and one guanylate kinase (GUK) domain. The GUK domain is located at the NH2 terminus, and the SH3 domain is replaced by two WW domains, followed by five PDZ domains numbered 1 to 5. An additional PDZ domain, termed PDZ0, is located above the GUK domain (Kotelevets2021A). 

MAGI3 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell signaling and junction stabilization. It interacts with several proteins, such as the PTEN tumor suppressor and the β-catenin and YAP1 proto-oncogenes, playing a role in signaling pathways like PI3K/AKT, Wnt, and Hippo (Kotelevets2021A). MAGI3 also acts as a scaffold protein in the SKP1-Cullin E3 ligase complex, facilitating the degradation of the c-Myc protein through its PDZ domains (Wang2022E3). 

Posttranslational modifications of MAGI3 include phosphorylation, SUMOylation, and cleavage by caspases, which may influence its function in cancer biology (Kotelevets2021A). The protein is ubiquitously expressed, with tissue-dependent splice variants, including a truncated form observed in breast cancers (Kotelevets2021A).

## Function
MAGI3 is a scaffolding protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining cell junction integrity and suppressing invasiveness, which are essential for healthy cellular function. It facilitates the formation of complexes between transmembrane and actin-binding proteins at tight and adherens junctions, crucial for maintaining epithelial barrier integrity. Disruption of these junctions can lead to increased permeability and inflammation, contributing to diseases like colorectal cancer (Kotelevets2021A).

MAGI3 is involved in several signaling pathways, including PI3K/AKT, Wnt, and Hippo, which are vital for cellular processes such as metabolism, proliferation, differentiation, and cell-cell interaction (Kotelevets2021A). It interacts with β-catenin at the plasma membrane, preventing its nuclear translocation and the transactivation of Wnt target genes, thus regulating cell proliferation and migration (Kotelevets2021A).

MAGI3 also plays a role in stabilizing adherens junctions, promoting E-cadherin-dependent cell-cell aggregation, and inhibiting cell migration and invasion, highlighting its role in maintaining cellular architecture and preventing pathological changes (Kotelevets2021A). It is ubiquitously expressed, with specific splice variants being expressed in a tissue-dependent manner (Kotelevets2021A).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the MAGI3 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly various forms of cancer and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In breast cancer, premature polyadenylation of MAGI3 results in a truncated protein that acts as an oncogene. This truncated form disrupts the normal interaction between full-length MAGI3 and the Hippo pathway effector YAP, leading to increased YAP activity and promoting oncogenic transformation (Ni2016Premature). Approximately 7.5% of breast cancer cases exhibit this alteration, highlighting its potential significance in cancer progression (Ni2016Premature).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), low levels of MAGI3 are associated with poor prognosis and recurrence. MAGI3 functions as a tumor suppressor by targeting the c-Myc protein for degradation, and its downregulation is linked to increased c-Myc activity and CRC development (Wang2022E3). High MAGI3 expression correlates with better chemotherapy response, suggesting its role as a predictive biomarker for treatment outcomes (Wang2022E3).

In IBD, genetic variations in MAGI3 are associated with decreased expression levels in inflamed colonic mucosa, potentially contributing to the disease's pathogenesis through pathways like PI3K/Akt and Wnt/β-catenin (Norén2017Genetic).

## Interactions
MAGI3 is a scaffolding protein that participates in various protein-protein interactions, playing a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. It acts as a novel substrate-binding subunit of the SKP1-Cullin E3 ligase complex, facilitating the ubiquitination and degradation of the c-Myc protein. This interaction is mediated through the fifth PDZ domain of MAGI3, which directly binds to c-Myc, and is crucial for c-Myc's ubiquitination and degradation (Wang2022E3).

MAGI3 also interacts with the Hippo pathway effector YAP, inhibiting its activity. This interaction is mediated by the PDZ6 domain of MAGI3 and is essential for suppressing YAP-dependent malignant transformation. Truncated forms of MAGI3, resulting from premature polyadenylation, lack this domain and act as dominant-negative variants, disrupting the interaction between full-length MAGI3 and YAP, thereby promoting oncogenic transformation (Ni2016Premature).

In addition, MAGI3 interacts with PTEN, a tumor suppressor, through its PDZ domain, influencing cellular junctions and signaling pathways (Wegmann2004Endothelial). These interactions highlight MAGI3's role in regulating key signaling pathways and maintaining cellular integrity.
