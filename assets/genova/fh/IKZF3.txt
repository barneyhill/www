# IKZF3

## Overview
IKZF3 is a gene that encodes the protein IKAROS family zinc finger 3, commonly referred to as Aiolos. This protein is a zinc finger transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of lymphocyte development, particularly influencing the differentiation and function of B and T cells. As a member of the Ikaros family of zinc finger proteins, Aiolos is characterized by its ability to bind DNA and interact with other proteins through its zinc finger domains, which are essential for its function in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. The IKZF3 gene is implicated in various immune-related processes and diseases, including autoimmune disorders and multiple myeloma, where it is involved in drug resistance mechanisms. The protein's interactions with other transcription factors and its regulation by post-translational modifications underscore its significance in maintaining immune homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhou2019RUNX; Li2018Polymorphisms; John2011The).

## Structure
The IKZF3 protein, also known as Aiolos, is a transcription factor that belongs to the Ikaros family of zinc finger proteins. It contains multiple zinc finger domains, which are crucial for its function in DNA binding and protein-protein interactions. The primary structure of IKZF3 includes a sequence of amino acids that form these zinc finger domains, specifically characterized by the presence of cysteine and histidine residues that coordinate zinc ions, maintaining the structural integrity of the protein (Sievers2018Defining).

The secondary structure of IKZF3 features a conserved fold composed of a β-hairpin and an α-helix, which are stabilized by zinc-coordinating cysteine and histidine residues. This structure is essential for sequence-specific DNA recognition, allowing IKZF3 to function effectively as a transcription factor (Sievers2018Defining).

IKZF3 is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can regulate its activity and interactions. The protein also exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can affect its function and the range of interactions it can engage in (Lazarian2021A). These structural features and modifications are critical for the role of IKZF3 in regulating gene expression in lymphoid cells.

## Function
IKZF3, also known as Aiolos, is a zinc finger transcription factor that plays a critical role in the regulation of lymphocyte development, particularly in B and T cells. It is involved in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation, influencing immune system function and maintaining immune homeostasis (John2011The). In healthy human cells, IKZF3 is tyrosine phosphorylated following IL-2 stimulation, which causes it to translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where it can exert its regulatory functions (John2011The).

IKZF3 is part of the Ikaros family of proteins, which are characterized by two sets of highly conserved C2H2-type zinc finger motifs. The N-terminal zinc fingers mediate binding to specific DNA sequences, while the C-terminal fingers enable dimerization and interaction with other transcriptional regulators (John2011The). This allows IKZF3 to regulate important cell-fate decisions during hematopoiesis, including the differentiation, proliferation, and survival of cells (John2011The).

In the context of the immune system, IKZF3 is involved in the regulation of immune responses, including B cell receptor signaling, T cell receptor signaling, and leukocyte migration. It is positively correlated with T and B cell infiltration, playing a crucial role in lymphocyte proliferation and differentiation (Yang2022Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IKZF3 gene have been implicated in various autoimmune diseases and conditions. The IKZF3 gene is associated with an increased risk of autoimmune thyroid diseases, particularly Graves' Disease (GD), but not Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (HT). Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within IKZF3, such as rs2941522, rs907091, rs1453559, rs12150079, and rs2872507, have been linked to GD, suggesting a role in its pathogenesis (Li2018Polymorphisms). The rs1453559 polymorphism is also associated with Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) and asthma, while rs12150079 is linked to Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) (Li2018Polymorphisms).

In multiple sclerosis (MS), the IKZF3 rs12946510 variant has shown a nominal association with MS susceptibility, particularly in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients, although this association did not meet the threshold for statistical significance (Stefanović2020The). The rs907091 SNP in IKZF3 is associated with MS, with the risk allele showing higher expression levels in MS patients, indicating a potential cis-regulatory mechanism (Keshari2016Allelic).

In multiple myeloma (MM), mutations in IKZF3, such as G159R/A, contribute to resistance to immunomodulatory drugs, highlighting its role in disease progression and treatment resistance (Barrio2019IKZF13).

## Interactions
IKZF3, also known as Aiolos, is involved in several significant protein interactions that influence its function in multiple myeloma (MM) and other contexts. IKZF3 forms complexes with the Runt-related transcription factors RUNX1 and RUNX3, as well as CBFβ, in MM cells. This interaction is facilitated by the N-terminal zinc finger domains of IKZF3, which bind to the activation and inhibitory domains of RUNX1, forming a complex crucial for MM cell survival (Zhou2019RUNX). RUNX proteins protect IKZF3 from degradation by competing with cereblon (CRBN) for binding, thereby inhibiting the CRBN-dependent ubiquitylation and degradation of IKZF3 upon lenalidomide treatment (Zhou2019RUNX).

IKZF3 also interacts with cereblon, a ubiquitin ligase, in the presence of lenalidomide. This interaction enhances the binding of IKZF3 to CRBN, leading to its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation, which is a key mechanism of lenalidomide's therapeutic effect in MM (Krönke2014Lenalidomide; Lu2014The). The degradation of IKZF3 is crucial for the drug's efficacy, as it leads to downstream effects on other proteins like IRF4 (Lu2014The).
