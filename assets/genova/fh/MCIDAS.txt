# MCIDAS

## Overview
The MCIDAS gene encodes the multiciliate differentiation and DNA synthesis associated cell cycle protein, commonly referred to as Multicilin. This protein is a transcriptional co-activator that plays a pivotal role in the differentiation of multiciliated cells (MCCs), which are essential for various physiological processes, including mucociliary clearance in the respiratory system and fluid movement in the brain and reproductive systems (Boon2014MCIDAS; Kyrousi2015Mcidas). Multicilin is involved in the regulation of gene expression necessary for the formation and function of motile cilia, interacting with transcription factors such as E2F4/5 and DP1 to activate multiciliogenesis pathways (Arbi2022McIdas; Lewis2023GEMC1). The protein's activity is crucial for the proper development of MCCs, and mutations in the MCIDAS gene can lead to disorders such as Reduced Generation of Multiple Motile Cilia (RGMC), highlighting its clinical significance (Boon2014MCIDAS).

## Function
The MCIDAS gene encodes a protein known as Multicilin, which plays a critical role in the differentiation of multiciliated cells (MCCs) in healthy human tissues. These cells are essential for processes such as mucociliary clearance in the respiratory system and fluid movement in the brain and reproductive systems (Boon2014MCIDAS; Kyrousi2015Mcidas). MCIDAS functions as a transcriptional co-activator, promoting the expression of genes necessary for the formation of multiple motile cilia, including those involved in centriole assembly and ciliary motility (Lu2018Mcidas; Boon2014MCIDAS).

MCIDAS interacts with transcription factors such as E2F4/5 and DP1 to activate gene expression programs essential for multiciliogenesis, including the deuterosome-mediated acentriolar pathway, which is crucial for the massive expansion of centrioles (Arbi2022McIdas; Lewis2023GEMC1). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it regulates the transcription of genes like FOXJ1, which are involved in ciliary differentiation and motility (Lu2018Mcidas). MCIDAS also interacts with the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, particularly the BRD9-containing ncBAF complexes, to facilitate transcriptional regulation during multiciliogenesis (Lewis2023GEMC1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MCIDAS gene are associated with a rare mucociliary clearance disorder known as Reduced Generation of Multiple Motile Cilia (RGMC). This condition is characterized by a significant reduction in the number of motile cilia, leading to recurrent infections of the upper and lower airways due to impaired mucociliary clearance (Boon2014MCIDAS). Individuals with biallelic MCIDAS mutations often experience chronic respiratory infections, postnatal respiratory distress syndrome, and may also suffer from hydrocephalus and female infertility, potentially linked to the dysfunction of multiciliated cells in the fallopian tubes and ependymal cells (Boon2014MCIDAS).

MCIDAS mutations result in severe axonemal defects and lack of ciliary motility, classifying the condition as a novel variant of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) (Boon2014MCIDAS). The absence of ciliary motility-related proteins in MCIDAS mutant cells leads to static cilia with ultrastructural defects, contributing to the disease phenotype (Legendre2021Motile). The gene's role in multiciliogenesis is crucial, and its disruption can lead to severe airway diseases and hydrocephalus, as the absence of cilia affects fluid flow in the airways and brain (Legendre2021Motile).

## Interactions
MCIDAS interacts with several proteins and plays a crucial role in multiciliated cell differentiation. It acts as a transcriptional co-activator by interacting with transcription factors E2F4 and E2F5 through its C-terminal TIRT domain, which is essential for transcriptional activation. This interaction is vital for the development of multiciliated cells in various tissues, including the murine brain and airway (Lewis2021Transcriptional). MCIDAS also regulates the expression of key transcription factors such as FOXJ1, FOXN4, RFX2, RFX3, MYB, and p73, which are involved in multiciliated cell differentiation (Lewis2021Transcriptional).

MCIDAS is involved in the transcriptional regulation necessary for multiciliated cell development, specifically by inducing components of the deuterosome pathway for basal body production. It interacts with cell-cycle regulators E2F4 and E2F5, allowing it to activate distinct sets of target genes related to ciliary transcription factors and basal body generation (Lu2018Mcidas). Additionally, MCIDAS is part of a transcriptional network with GMNC, which is crucial for the formation of multiple motile cilia. This network is essential for proper multiciliogenesis and is implicated in conditions such as choroid plexus carcinoma when disrupted (Li2022Disruption).
