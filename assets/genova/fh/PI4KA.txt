# PI4KA

## Overview
Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase alpha (PI4KA) is a gene that encodes a crucial enzyme involved in the phosphoinositide signaling pathway, specifically responsible for the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P). This enzyme, categorized as a kinase, plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including membrane trafficking, lipid signaling, and cell growth. PI4KA is predominantly located in the endoplasmic reticulum but also associates with other cellular membranes, such as the plasma membrane and Golgi apparatus, through a complex with TTC7 and FAM126 proteins (Shaw2024Structure; Bura2023A). The enzyme's activity is regulated by interactions with other proteins, such as Calcineurin, and is essential for normal brain development and the replication of certain viruses, including hepatitis C (Shaw2024Structure; Bura2023A). Mutations in the PI4KA gene are linked to several autosomal recessive disorders and have implications in various diseases, including cancer and neurological conditions (Zhang2022A; Jiang2022Targeting).

## Structure
Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase alpha (PI4KA) is a key enzyme involved in phosphoinositide signaling pathways. The molecular structure of PI4KA includes several distinct domains and motifs that contribute to its function and regulation. The enzyme is part of a complex with TTC7 and FAM126 proteins, forming a dimer of trimers, which stabilizes its structure and activity (Suresh2024Molecular; Shaw2024Structure).

The primary structure of PI4KA features an evolutionarily conserved IKISVT sequence in its horn domain, which interacts with the phosphatase Calcineurin, specifically the CNAβ1 isoform (Shaw2024Structure). The secondary structure includes a solenoid domain, which was previously unresolved but has been highlighted in recent studies (Shaw2024Structure).

PI4KA's tertiary structure involves interactions with Calcineurin, where specific regions such as a beta strand (residues 536-541) and an unstructured loop in the dimerization domain bind to Calcineurin's NIR region and CNB, respectively (Shaw2024Structure). The quaternary structure is characterized by its assembly into a stable stoichiometric dimer of pentamers, consisting of PI4KA, TTC7B, FAM126A, CNA, and CNB (Shaw2024Structure).

The enzyme's activity is regulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which may influence its interaction with regulatory proteins and its localization to the plasma membrane (Suresh2024Molecular).

## Function
Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase alpha (PI4KA) is a crucial enzyme involved in the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P), a key lipid signaling molecule. PI4KA is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and transiently associates with various cellular membranes, including the plasma membrane (PM), early cis-Golgi compartments, and the outer mitochondrial membrane (Bura2023A). It plays a significant role in membrane trafficking and lipid signaling, influencing processes such as cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis (Li2021Research).

PI4KA is responsible for generating the largest hormone-sensitive PM PI4P pool, despite not being membrane-bound itself. It is transported to the PM by a carrier complex containing TTC7A, EFR3, and FAM126A (Bura2023A). In the ER, PI4P produced by PI4KA may be transported to the PM or cis-Golgi, where it regulates coat protein complex I trafficking by altering PI4P levels (Bura2023A). In the nucleus, PI4P pools are used for nuclear PI(4,5)P2 production (Bura2023A).

PI4KA is highly expressed in the brain and is important in early brain development. Its defect leads to neuropathy and hypomyelination (Bura2023A). The enzyme is also essential for the replication of the hepatitis C virus, as it is recruited by the NS5A viral protein to provide PI4P for membranous web formation (Bura2023A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PI4KA gene are associated with a range of autosomal recessive diseases, including neurological, intestinal, and immunological conditions. Specific disorders linked to PI4KA mutations include perisylvian polymicrogyria with cerebellar hypoplasia and arthrogryposis, which are characterized by developmental delays, intellectual impairments, and motor difficulties. Another condition, autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia-84, involves progressive walking difficulties due to lower limb spasticity. Additionally, gastrointestinal defects and immunodeficiency syndrome 2 are marked by intestinal atresia and immunodeficiency (Zhang2022A).

PI4KA mutations have also been implicated in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The gene's polymorphism, PI4KA-rs165854, is associated with schizophrenia, particularly in patients with poor antipsychotic response (Zhang2022A). In cancer, PI4KA is involved in oncogenic processes, such as in prostate cancer where it interacts with CXCR4, contributing to metastasis and poor prognosis (Jiang2022Targeting; Govindarajan2023Adaptor).

Alterations in PI4KA interactions can impact KRAS-driven oncogenesis, particularly in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, by affecting KRAS localization and signaling (Adhikari2021Oncogenic). In leukemia, PI4KA is a potential target for overcoming drug resistance, as its inhibition can sensitize resistant leukemia cells to chemotherapy (Jiang2022Targeting).

## Interactions
PI4KA, or phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase alpha, is a key component of a multiprotein complex that includes TTC7 and FAM126. This complex is crucial for the synthesis of phosphoinositides at the plasma membrane. PI4KA interacts with TTC7 and FAM126 through extensive buried surfaces, forming a stable, homodimeric complex that enhances its enzymatic activity (Lees2017Architecture). The recruitment of PI4KA to the plasma membrane is mediated by interactions with lipidated proteins EFR3A and EFR3B, which are essential for its localization and function (Suresh2024Molecular).

PI4KA also interacts with the phosphatase Calcineurin, which regulates its activity. This interaction involves a dual interface in both PI4KA and FAM126A, with Calcineurin binding to conserved sequences in PI4KA's horn domain and the C-terminus of FAM126A (Shaw2024Structure). In the context of oncogenic signaling, PI4KA is recruited to the plasma membrane by EFR3A, where it co-localizes with KRAS, a protein involved in cancer progression. This interaction is crucial for KRAS's localization and nanoclustering, which enhances its oncogenic signaling (Adhikari2021Oncogenic). PI4KA's interactions with these proteins highlight its role in various cellular processes and disease mechanisms.
