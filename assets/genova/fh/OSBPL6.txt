# OSBPL6

## Overview
OSBPL6, or oxysterol-binding protein-like 6, is a gene that encodes a member of the oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) family, which is involved in lipid metabolism and transport. The protein product, ORP6, is characterized as a lipid-binding protein that plays a crucial role in cholesterol homeostasis and phosphoinositide metabolism. ORP6 contains several functional domains, including a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain for membrane targeting and an OSBP-related ligand-binding domain (ORD) for binding sterols and phosphoinositides. These structural features enable ORP6 to localize to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and ER-plasma membrane contact sites, where it facilitates lipid transfer and cholesterol trafficking. The protein's interactions with other proteins, such as ORP3 and VAPA, further underscore its role in cellular lipid distribution and signaling pathways. Variations in the OSBPL6 gene have been associated with conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and cholesterol metabolism disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Herold2016Familybased; Ouimet2016miRNA; Mochizuki2018Oxysterolbinding).

## Structure
OSBPL6, also known as oxysterol-binding protein-related protein 6 (ORP6), is characterized by several structural domains that contribute to its function in lipid metabolism. The protein contains a conserved OSBP-related ligand-binding domain (ORD) at the C-terminus, which is responsible for binding sterols and phosphoinositides (Ouimet2016miRNA; Mochizuki2018Oxysterolbinding). At the N-terminus, OSBPL6 features a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which facilitates membrane targeting by binding to specific phosphoinositides such as phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P), PI(4,5)P₂, and PI(3,4,5)P₃ (Mochizuki2018Oxysterolbinding).

The protein also includes a coiled-coil domain located between the PH domain and the FFAT motif, which is involved in dimerization and interaction with other proteins like ORP3 (Mochizuki2018Oxysterolbinding). The FFAT motif tethers OSBPL6 to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, facilitating its localization to ER-plasma membrane contact sites (Mochizuki2018Oxysterolbinding). These structural features enable OSBPL6 to participate in lipid transfer processes and cholesterol homeostasis (Ouimet2016miRNA). The protein's ability to form dimers may influence its localization and function at membrane contact sites (Mochizuki2018Oxysterolbinding).

## Function
OSBPL6, also known as oxysterol-binding protein-like 6 (ORP6), is involved in several critical cellular processes related to lipid metabolism and transport. It localizes primarily to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and ER-plasma membrane contact sites, where it plays a role in the turnover of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) in cerebellar granule neurons (Mochizuki2018Oxysterolbinding). ORP6 is also implicated in cholesterol trafficking and efflux, facilitating the movement of cholesterol between the endolysosomal network and the ER, which is crucial for maintaining cholesterol homeostasis (Ouimet2016miRNA).

The protein's pleckstrin homology (PH) domain allows it to bind phosphatidylinositol phosphates, which are important for its localization to membrane contact sites (Mochizuki2018Oxysterolbinding). ORP6 is also involved in lipid exchange mechanisms, potentially exchanging PI4P for cholesterol, which is essential for cellular lipid distribution and signaling (Mochizuki2018Oxysterolbinding). In terms of organismal outcomes, OSBPL6 expression is linked to cholesterol homeostasis, with its regulation affecting plasma levels of HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1, suggesting a role in cardiovascular health (Ouimet2016miRNA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the OSBPL6 gene have been associated with several diseases and conditions. Variants in OSBPL6 have been linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD), with specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) such as rs1347297 showing genome-wide significance in family-based studies. However, these associations have not consistently replicated in case-control datasets, indicating that the clinical significance of OSBPL6 in AD requires further investigation (Herold2016Familybased).

OSBPL6 is also implicated in cholesterol homeostasis, with its expression regulated by miRNAs like miR-33 and miR-27b. Alterations in OSBPL6 expression can affect cholesterol trafficking and efflux, potentially contributing to atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease. The gene's expression is upregulated in response to increased cholesterol levels, and its knockdown leads to impaired cholesterol movement and accumulation of free cholesterol, similar to conditions seen in cholesterol metabolism disorders (Ouimet2016miRNA).

Additionally, OSBPL6 has been identified as a potential candidate gene in studies of short stature in children born small for gestational age, suggesting that copy number variants involving OSBPL6 may contribute to this condition (Wit2014Copy).

## Interactions
OSBPL6, also known as ORP6, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. ORP6 interacts with ORP3, forming dimers with itself and ORP3, but not with ORP5. This interaction is significant at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and ER-plasma membrane (PM) contact sites, where ORP6 and ORP3 co-localize (Mochizuki2018Oxysterolbinding). The pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of ORP6 binds specifically to phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P), PI(4,5)P₂, PI(3,4,5)P₃, and phosphatidic acid, which are present in the plasma membrane, suggesting a role in membrane contact site localization (Mochizuki2018Oxysterolbinding).

ORP6 also interacts with the ER integral protein VAPA, indicating its involvement in sterol transport between the ER and other cellular compartments (Ouimet2016miRNA). This interaction is crucial for cholesterol trafficking, as silencing ORP6 impairs cholesterol movement from the endolysosomal network to the ER, leading to cholesterol accumulation (Ouimet2016miRNA). These interactions highlight the role of OSBPL6 in lipid metabolism and cellular signaling pathways.
