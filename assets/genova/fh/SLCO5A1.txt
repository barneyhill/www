# SLCO5A1

## Overview
SLCO5A1 is a gene that encodes the solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 5A1, a protein belonging to the solute carrier (SLC) superfamily and specifically the organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) family. This protein is characterized as a transmembrane transporter, predicted to have twelve transmembrane domains, and is involved in the transport of organic anions across cellular membranes. Despite its classification, the specific substrates of SLCO5A1 in healthy human cells remain unidentified, suggesting it may have non-classical functions. The protein is expressed in various tissues, including immune cells, where it may play a role in differentiation and migration processes. SLCO5A1 has been implicated in several clinical conditions, such as juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and various cancers, where its expression levels can influence disease prognosis and patient outcomes (Roshandel2023SLCO5A1; Wang2022The; Sebastian2013Characterization).

## Structure
The SLCO5A1 protein, encoded by the SLCO5A1 gene, is a member of the solute carrier (SLC) superfamily and is part of the organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) family. It is predicted to have a secondary structure consisting of twelve transmembrane domains, with six extracellular and five intracellular loops, and both N- and C-termini facing the cytosol (Sebastian2013Characterization). The protein contains 848 amino acids, corresponding to a calculated molecular mass of 92 kDa, although its core protein mass is observed at 74 kDa after deglycosylation due to anomalous electrophoretic mobility (Sebastian2013Characterization).

The SLCO5A1 protein undergoes N-glycosylation, with at least three N-glycans present, and can form stable higher-order structures such as homodimers, with an apparent mass of 220 kDa (Sebastian2013Characterization). It includes a Kazal domain, which typically acts as a serine protease inhibitor, and is part of the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS), which are membrane proteins that transport small solutes across membranes (Roshandel2023SLCO5A1). The protein's structure is further characterized by the presence of alpha helices, beta strands, and loops, as highlighted in a predicted model covering amino acids 115-766 (Roshandel2023SLCO5A1).

## Function
SLCO5A1 encodes a solute carrier transport protein that is part of the organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) family. This protein is involved in the transport of organic anions across cell membranes, although its specific substrates in healthy human cells remain unidentified (Sebastian2013Characterization). SLCO5A1 is expressed in various tissues, including mature dendritic cells, where its expression increases during differentiation from monocytes, suggesting a role in immune cell differentiation (Sebastian2013Characterization). 

The protein is found in both intracellular membranes and the plasma membrane, existing in different glycosylated forms, which may influence its function and localization (Sebastian2013Characterization). In HeLa cells, SLCO5A1 is expressed as a membrane-bound protein with multiple N-glycans, indicating its processing through the endoplasmic reticulum (Sebastian2013Characterization). Despite its presence on the plasma membrane, SLCO5A1 does not transport known substrates of the OATP family, suggesting it may have a non-classical function (Sebastian2013Characterization). The protein's potential role in processes requiring cell shape reorganization, such as differentiation and migration, has been suggested, although its precise function in healthy human cells is not fully characterized (Sebastian2013Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
The SLCO5A1 gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its altered expression or genetic variations. In juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), SLCO5A1 is associated with impulsivity and seizure susceptibility. Studies have shown that downregulation of SLCO5A1 may increase susceptibility to seizures, and its expression is linked to genes involved in presynaptic membrane organization, which are associated with impulsivity in JME (Roshandel2023SLCO5A1). 

In high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), higher expression of SLCO5A1 is associated with better overall survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Svoboda2018Clinical). Conversely, in uveal melanoma, high SLCO5A1 expression correlates with worse overall survival, indicating a negative prognostic significance in this context (Wang2022The).

SLCO5A1 is also expressed in various cancers, including prostate and breast cancer, and is involved in cellular differentiation processes. However, its specific substrates and detailed functions remain to be fully characterized (Sebastian2013Characterization). These findings highlight the gene's diverse roles in different diseases and its potential impact on clinical outcomes.
