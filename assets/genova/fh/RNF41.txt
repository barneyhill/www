# RNF41

## Overview
RNF41, also known as ring finger protein 41, is a gene that encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase protein involved in various cellular processes, including protein ubiquitination and intracellular transport. The protein, characterized by a RING domain and a coiled-coil (CC) domain, plays a significant role in the regulation of receptor signaling and immune responses. It interacts with several proteins, such as VPS52 and MYO1C, influencing pathways related to protein degradation and stability (Xiong2024A; Masschaele2017RNF41). RNF41 is implicated in the modulation of immune signaling pathways, such as TLR-mediated responses, and has been associated with the regulation of cancer-related processes, including metastasis and tumor suppression (Lian2019CACYBP; Cai2022The). Its involvement in these critical pathways underscores its potential as a therapeutic target in various diseases, particularly in oncology (Zeng2022m6Amodified).

## Structure
RNF41, also known as ring finger protein 41, is characterized by several distinct structural domains that contribute to its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The protein contains a RING domain located in its amino-terminal half, which is crucial for its ubiquitin ligase activity (Masschaele2017RNF41). This domain is followed by a coiled-coil (CC) domain in the carboxy-terminal half, which is essential for interactions with other proteins, such as VPS52 (Masschaele2017RNF41). The CC domain is involved in forming trimeric structures, facilitating the dynamic assembly and disassembly of protein complexes (Masschaele2017RNF41).

A specific leucine residue, L163, within the CC domain is critical for binding to VPS52, although it does not affect RNF41 oligomerization (Masschaele2017RNF41). The interaction between RNF41 and VPS52 is mediated by electrostatic compatibility between their helices, suggesting the formation of heterotrimers (Masschaele2017RNF41).

RNF41 can undergo post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination, which influences its stability and function (Masschaele2017RNF41). The protein also exists in splice variant isoforms, which may impact its functional interactions and regulatory roles (Masschaele2018HighConfidence). These structural features enable RNF41 to participate in various cellular processes, including intracellular transport and receptor signaling.

## Function
RNF41, also known as Ring Finger Protein 41, is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a crucial role in the ubiquitination and regulation of various proteins within healthy human cells. It is involved in the ubiquitination of receptors and signaling molecules such as ErbB3, IL-3, EPO, RARα, MyD88, TBK1, and USP8, which influences receptor signaling and routing, affecting pathways like lysosomal degradation and ectodomain shedding (Masschaele2017RNF41). RNF41 interacts with VPS52, a subunit of the GARP and EARP complexes, which are involved in retrograde transport and recycling of proteins within the cell, suggesting a role in intracellular transport regulation (Masschaele2017RNF41).

In the immune system, RNF41 modulates TLR-stimulated signaling pathways by promoting TRIF-dependent activation of TBK1 and IRF3, enhancing TLR-mediated IFN-I production, which is crucial for antiviral responses (Cai2022The). It also facilitates the degradation of MyD88, attenuating inflammatory cytokine production and maintaining immune homeostasis (Cai2022The). Additionally, RNF41 regulates the degradation of the Clec9A receptor in dendritic cells, impacting antigen presentation and immune responses (Tullett2020RNF41). These functions highlight RNF41's importance in maintaining cellular and immune homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the RNF41 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In prostate cancer, RNF41 is upregulated in metastatic tissues and promotes metastasis by stabilizing the MYO1C protein, which is involved in actin remodeling. This stabilization facilitates cancer cell migration and invasion, suggesting that RNF41 could be a target for therapeutic intervention in metastatic prostate cancer (Xiong2024A).

In colorectal cancer, RNF41 interacts with circFNDC3B to suppress cancer stemness and metastasis by degrading ASB6, a protein associated with poor prognosis. This interaction highlights RNF41's potential as a therapeutic target in colorectal cancer (Zeng2022m6Amodified).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, RNF41 acts as a tumor suppressor by degrading CACYBP, which otherwise promotes tumor progression by retaining the cell cycle regulator P27 Kip1 in the cytoplasm. Reduced RNF41 expression in tumor tissues correlates with increased CACYBP levels, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Lian2019CACYBP).

RNF41 is also involved in the regulation of HER3, a receptor implicated in oncogenic signaling. Its role in HER3 ubiquitination affects the efficacy of anti-HER3 antibody therapies, indicating that RNF41 expression levels could influence treatment outcomes in HER2-amplified cancers (Turowec2019Functional).

## Interactions
RNF41, also known as Nrdp1, is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that participates in various protein interactions, influencing multiple cellular processes. It interacts with MYO1C, a motor protein involved in actin remodeling, promoting its stability through K27/K63-linked ubiquitination. This interaction is crucial for prostate cancer metastasis, as RNF41 and MYO1C colocalize in the cytoplasm and their interaction is confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation (Xiong2024A).

RNF41 also interacts with VPS52, a subunit of the GARP and EARP complexes, through its coiled-coil (CC) domain. This interaction is mediated by a critical leucine residue at position 163 in RNF41 and involves the N-terminal CC domain of VPS52. The interaction affects RNF41 oligomerization and stability, suggesting a role in protein sorting and degradation pathways (Masschaele2017RNF41).

In colorectal cancer, RNF41 is involved in the degradation of ASB6 through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This process is enhanced by circFNDC3B, which stabilizes RNF41 mRNA by binding to FXR2, thereby suppressing cancer stemness and metastasis (Zeng2022m6Amodified).

RNF41 also interacts with Clec9A in mouse dendritic cells, influencing antigen cross-presentation. This interaction is enhanced by proteasome inhibition, suggesting RNF41 may ubiquitinate Clec9A or its associated antigen cargo (Tullett2020RNF41).
