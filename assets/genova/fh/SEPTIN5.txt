# SEPTIN5

## Overview
SEPTIN5 is a gene that encodes the protein septin 5, a member of the septin family of GTP-binding proteins. Septin 5 is primarily involved in cellular processes related to the nervous system, including synaptic transmission and neuronal migration. It is predominantly expressed in the brain, where it localizes to presynaptic terminals and associates with synaptic vesicles, playing a critical role in regulating neurotransmitter release. The protein's function is modulated by phosphorylation through cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), which influences its interaction with syntaxin-1, a key component of the SNARE complex involved in vesicle fusion (Dolat2013Septin; Amin2008CyclinDependent). Beyond its neurological roles, septin 5 is implicated in maintaining cell shape, facilitating cell division, and ensuring proper cellular compartmentalization (Neubauer2017The). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its involvement in various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, as well as certain cancers and hematological conditions (Neubauer2017The; Marttinen2015Synaptic).

## Structure
SEPTIN5 is a member of the septin family of GTP-binding proteins, characterized by a conserved GTPase domain. The primary structure of SEPTIN5 includes several key domains: a polybasic region, GTP-binding sites (G1, G3, and G4) within the GTP-binding domain, and a coiled-coil domain at the C-terminus (Amin2008CyclinDependent). The secondary structure of SEPTIN5 consists of alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its three-dimensional folding, although specific details on these elements are not extensively described in the context provided.

In terms of quaternary structure, SEPTIN5 often forms hetero-oligomeric complexes with other septins, which is a common feature of septin proteins (Helmprobst2017Expression). SEPTIN5 is subject to post-translational modifications, notably phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), which modulates its interaction with other proteins such as syntaxin-1, affecting exocytosis (Amin2008CyclinDependent).

SEPTIN5 also has splice variant isoforms, such as Sept5_v1 and Sept5_v2, which differ in their N-terminal sequences and phosphorylation sites, leading to variations in their functional roles and interactions within the cell (Asada2009Neuronal). These isoforms are expressed predominantly in the brain, with distinct expression patterns and potential implications for neurological functions (Asada2009Neuronal).

## Function
SEPTIN5, a member of the septin family of GTP-binding proteins, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, particularly in the nervous system. It is predominantly expressed in the brain and is involved in synaptic transmission and neuronal migration. SEPTIN5 localizes to presynaptic terminals and is associated with synaptic vesicles, where it regulates neurotransmitter release by interacting with syntaxin-1, a component of the SNARE complex essential for vesicle fusion (Dolat2013Septin; Amin2008CyclinDependent).

Phosphorylation of SEPTIN5 by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) modulates its interaction with syntaxin-1, thereby influencing exocytosis. This phosphorylation decreases SEPTIN5's binding to syntaxin-1, which affects the formation of SNARE complexes and synaptic vesicle dynamics (Amin2008CyclinDependent). SEPTIN5 also interacts with dynamin, suggesting a role in endocytosis and the recycling of synaptic vesicles (Dolat2013Septin).

In addition to its role in the nervous system, SEPTIN5 is involved in maintaining cell shape, facilitating cell division, and ensuring proper cellular compartmentalization. It is active at the cell membrane and cytoskeleton, contributing to cellular stability and function (Neubauer2017The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SEPTIN5 gene have been implicated in several diseases. SEPTIN5 is associated with neurodegenerative disorders, particularly Parkinson's disease (PD). It interacts with parkin, an E3-ubiquitin ligase, and mutations in parkin lead to the accumulation of SEPTIN5, contributing to neuronal toxicity and selective dopamine-dependent neurodegeneration (Neubauer2017The; Marttinen2015Synaptic). SEPTIN5 is also involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD), where deregulation of CDK5-mediated phosphorylation may alter its function, potentially affecting synaptic vesicle release and contributing to AD pathology (Marttinen2015Synaptic).

In hematological malignancies, SEPTIN5 is a fusion partner in chromosomal translocations with the MLL gene, contributing to leukemogenesis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (Neubauer2017The; Connolly2011Septin). SEPTIN5 overexpression has been noted in pancreatic cancer, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis (Connolly2011Septin). Additionally, SEPTIN5 is linked to Bernard-Soulier syndrome, a blood disorder characterized by excessive bleeding, where abnormal expression affects platelet function (Dolat2013Septin). These findings highlight the clinical significance of SEPTIN5 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
SEPTIN5 interacts with several proteins, playing a role in various cellular processes. It binds with syntaxin-1, a SNARE protein involved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis. This interaction is modulated by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) phosphorylation, which decreases SEPTIN5's binding to syntaxin-1, affecting exocytosis (Amin2008CyclinDependent). SEPTIN5 also interacts with p35 and p25, components associated with Cdk5, suggesting a role in modulating exocytosis through these interactions (Amin2008CyclinDependent).

SEPTIN5 is involved in the ubiquitination process through its interaction with parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Parkin ubiquitinates SEPTIN5, indicating a regulatory role in its degradation. This interaction is significant in the context of Parkinson's disease, where SEPTIN5 levels are altered (Choi2003SEPT5v2).

Additionally, SEPTIN5 interacts with ARMS/Kidins220, a protein involved in neurotrophin signaling. This interaction is important for neurite outgrowth and cytoskeletal remodeling, with the N-terminal region of SEPTIN5 being crucial for binding (Park2010Ankyrin).
