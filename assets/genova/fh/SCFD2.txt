# SCFD2

## Overview
SCFD2 (sec1 family domain containing 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in intracellular transport processes, particularly vesicle docking and exocytosis. The SCFD2 protein is categorized as a component of the vesicular transport machinery, playing a crucial role in protein trafficking and secretion within the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. This function is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and ensuring proper protein distribution within cells (Gupta2023Identification). The gene has been implicated in various biological processes and diseases, including neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer, highlighting its clinical significance. Research indicates that SCFD2 interacts with several proteins associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and is involved in pathways that influence breast cancer progression and treatment resistance (Takeiwa2022PSPC1). The conservation of specific residues within the protein across multiple species underscores its essential role in shared biological processes (Gupta2023Identification).

## Function
SCFD2 (sec1 family domain containing 2) is involved in intracellular transport processes, particularly in vesicle docking and exocytosis. The protein is associated with the regulation of vesicle-mediated transport, playing a crucial role in protein trafficking and secretion within the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. This function is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and ensuring proper protein distribution within cells (Gupta2023Identification).

In healthy human cells, SCFD2 is predicted to be involved in vesicular transport processes, although its exact function remains elusive. The protein's role in these processes suggests its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and contributing to cellular homeostasis (Gupta2023Identification). The conservation of the P383 residue across eight vertebrate species, including humans, underscores its vital role in shared biological processes, indicating that alterations in SCFD2 could have detrimental consequences (Gupta2023Identification).

Research has also observed p53 binding to the SCFD2 promoter following hypoxia and DNA damage, suggesting a potential role in cellular stress responses. However, the specific molecular activities of SCFD2 in healthy human cells are not fully detailed in the available literature (Gupta2023Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SCFD2 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in breast cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders. In ER-positive breast cancer, SCFD2 is associated with poor prognosis. High expression levels of SCFD2, along with its downstream targets DDIAS and MYBL1, correlate with higher rates of disease relapse and shorter survival times. SCFD2 silencing has been shown to suppress tumor growth in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells, highlighting its role in cancer progression (Takeiwa2022PSPC1).

In the context of neurodevelopmental disorders, SCFD2 has been identified as a novel autism gene. A specific homozygous missense variant, c.1148C > T, p.P383L, in SCFD2 has been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This variant is predicted to cause structural instability in the protein, potentially affecting its function. SCFD2 is also linked to other neurodevelopmental conditions, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder. The gene's interactions with other proteins involved in neurodevelopmental disorders further emphasize its clinical significance (Gupta2023Identification).

These findings suggest that SCFD2 plays a critical role in both cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
SCFD2 is involved in various protein interactions that are significant for its role in cellular processes. It interacts with multiple protein partners associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Notably, SCFD2 interacts with PCDHGC4, a gene linked to progressive microcephaly, seizures, and joint anomalies. It also interacts with HS2ST1, where biallelic mutations have been associated with developmental delay, intellectual disability, and other anomalies (Gupta2023Identification).

In the context of breast cancer, SCFD2 is part of a signaling pathway involving PSPC1 and PSF, which are RNA-binding proteins. PSPC1 interacts with SCFD2 and ESR1 transcripts, influencing their expression and contributing to the proliferation and tamoxifen resistance of ER-positive breast cancer cells. This interaction is significant for post-transcriptional regulation and is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients (Takeiwa2022PSPC1). SCFD2 is also identified as a downstream target of PSPC1 and PSF, with its strong immunoreactivity linked to shorter disease-free and overall survival in ER-positive breast cancer patients (Takeiwa2022PSPC1). These interactions highlight SCFD2's role in both neurodevelopmental and cancer-related pathways.
