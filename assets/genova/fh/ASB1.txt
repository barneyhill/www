# ASB1

## Overview
ASB1 (ankyrin repeat and SOCS box containing 1) is a gene that encodes a protein functioning as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This pathway is essential for protein degradation and maintaining cellular protein homeostasis. The ASB1 protein is characterized by its N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain and C-terminal suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) box, which facilitate its role in substrate recognition and interaction with ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, respectively (Zhao2024ASB1). ASB1 is ubiquitously expressed across mammalian tissues and is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, transcription, and apoptosis (Anasa2018Multifaceted). It has been implicated in the regulation of protein turnover and stability, influencing cell differentiation and proliferation, and is associated with several clinical conditions, including prostate cancer and anxiety disorders (Zhao2024ASB1; Emeny2017Anxiety).

## Structure
The ASB1 protein is part of the ASB family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, characterized by an N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain and a C-terminal suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) box. The ankyrin repeat domain is involved in protein-protein interactions and typically forms a helix-loop-helix structure, which is crucial for substrate recognition (Zhao2024ASB1). The SOCS box facilitates the recruitment of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, playing a key role in the ubiquitination process by forming complexes with elongin B and C (Zhao2024ASB1).

The ASB1 protein's structure allows it to function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, where it recognizes target proteins and aids in the transfer of ubiquitin, influencing protein stability and localization (Zhao2024ASB1). This structural configuration is essential for its role in cellular processes, such as the degradation of CHCHD3 in prostate cancer cells, which is mediated through K48-linked ubiquitination (Zhao2024ASB1). While specific details on the primary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of ASB1 are not provided, the presence of ankyrin repeats and a SOCS box are significant structural features that define its function.

## Function
ASB1 (ankyrin repeat and SOCS box containing 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which is crucial for protein degradation and maintaining protein homeostasis. The ASB1 protein is characterized by N-terminal ankyrin repeats and a C-terminal SOCS box domain. These structural features enable ASB1 to function as a substrate-recognition subunit of elongin-cullin-SOCS (ECS) complexes, facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin to target proteins, marking them for degradation by the proteasome (Anasa2018Multifaceted).

ASB1 is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues and is localized in the nucleoplasm, indicating its involvement in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, transcription, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis (Anasa2018Multifaceted). The protein's ankyrin repeats mediate substrate recognition, while the SOCS box domain interacts with components of the ECS complex, such as Cul5 and Rbx2, to facilitate ubiquitination (Anasa2018Multifaceted).

In healthy human cells, ASB1 is implicated in regulating protein turnover and stability, potentially influencing cell differentiation and proliferation. It shares functional similarities with other ASB family members, such as ASB2, in promoting the degradation of proteins like E47 and Jak2 (Nie2010Notchinduced).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the ASB1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In prostate cancer, ASB1 acts as a tumor suppressor. Its expression is significantly decreased in prostate cancer tissues, correlating with poor prognosis. Low ASB1 expression is associated with increased M2 macrophages and resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors and cisplatin, but sensitivity to bicalutamide. Silencing ASB1 enhances prostate cancer cell proliferation, while overexpression inhibits it by promoting the degradation of CHCHD3 through K48-linked ubiquitination, affecting the CHCHD3/reactive oxygen species (ROS) pathway (Zhao2024ASB1).

In anxiety disorders, increased methylation in the promoter region of the ASB1 gene is linked to severe anxiety symptoms. This methylation is associated with stress-induced proinflammatory gene expression and panic symptom severity. ASB1's role in anxiety is further supported by its increased expression in response to acute stress in mouse models (Emeny2017Anxiety).

ASB1 is also involved in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), where its expression and methylation levels influence tumor growth and prognosis. High methylation of ASB1 is a marker of cardiac deterioration, although direct associations with tumors are not well established (Xie2023A).

## Interactions
ASB1 interacts with the protein CHCHD3, a key player in prostate cancer progression. This interaction involves ASB1 enhancing the K48-linked ubiquitination of CHCHD3, leading to its degradation. The interaction between ASB1 and CHCHD3 was confirmed through bioinformatics tools, immunostaining, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Zhao2024ASB1). ASB1's role in this process suggests it acts as a tumor suppressor by destabilizing CHCHD3, thereby inhibiting the CHCHD3/reactive oxygen species (ROS) pathway, which is crucial for reducing prostate cancer cell proliferation and migration (Zhao2024ASB1).

ASB1 is part of the ASB family of proteins, which are characterized by ankyrin repeats and a SOCS box domain. These domains facilitate protein-protein interactions, particularly with components of the elongin-cullin-SOCS (ECS) complex. ASB1, like other ASB proteins, interacts with scaffold proteins such as Cullin and RING finger protein RBX through its SOCS box domain, which is essential for its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase (Anasa2018Multifaceted). This interaction is crucial for the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins, influencing various cellular processes (Anasa2018Multifaceted).
