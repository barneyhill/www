# LASP1NB

## Overview
The LASP1NB gene encodes the LASP1 neighbor protein, which is a member of the nebulin family of actin-binding proteins. This protein is involved in cytoskeletal organization and cellular signaling pathways. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of cells and is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell motility and proliferation. The LASP1 neighbor protein is characterized by its ability to interact with other cytoskeletal proteins, thereby influencing cellular architecture and dynamics. Its expression and function are of particular interest in the context of cancer biology, where alterations in its activity may contribute to tumor progression and metastasis (Qiu2020aarFDC).
