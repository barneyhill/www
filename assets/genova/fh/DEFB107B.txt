# DEFB107B

## Overview
DEFB107B is a gene that encodes the protein defensin beta 107B, a member of the beta-defensin family, which is integral to the innate immune system. This protein is categorized as an antimicrobial peptide, characterized by its small size and cationic nature, enabling it to disrupt microbial membranes and provide a defense against a range of pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses (Hollox2008Defensins). The DEFB107 gene is located on chromosome 8p23.1, a region known for its copy number variability, which can influence the expression and efficacy of defensin proteins (Forni2015Determining; Taudien2004Polymorphic). Defensin beta 107B is predominantly expressed in epithelial cells, where it contributes to mucosal immunity and homeostasis, and is also notably expressed in the testis, suggesting a potential role in male reproductive health (Hollox2003Extensive; Ottolini2014Evidence).

## Function
DEFB107B encodes the protein defensin beta 107B, which is part of the beta-defensin family known for its role in the innate immune system. These proteins are small, cationic peptides that exhibit antimicrobial properties, contributing to the body's defense against bacterial, fungal, and viral infections (Hollox2008Defensins). Defensin beta 107B is primarily active in epithelial cells, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining mucosal immunity and homeostasis by disrupting microbial membranes (Hollox2003Extensive).

The DEFB107 gene is located within a copy number variable region on chromosome 8p23.1, which is rich in segmental duplications. This region's variability can influence the expression levels of defensin genes, including DEFB107, potentially affecting their antimicrobial efficacy and contributing to individual differences in immune response (Forni2015Determining; Taudien2004Polymorphic). Although the specific function of DEFB107B in healthy cells is not fully detailed, its involvement in antimicrobial defense suggests a significant role in protecting epithelial surfaces from pathogenic invasion (Hollox2008Defensins). The gene's expression is notably strong in the testis, indicating a possible role in male fertility (Ottolini2014Evidence).
