# CPLX3

## Overview
CPLX3 is a gene that encodes the protein complexin 3, which is a crucial component in the regulation of synaptic vesicle exocytosis, particularly within the retina. Complexin 3 is categorized as a synaptic regulatory protein, playing a significant role in modulating neurotransmitter release by interacting with the SNARE complex, a key element in synaptic vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. The protein is predominantly expressed in retinal cells, such as cone photoreceptor terminals and rod bipolar cells, where it contributes to the specialized release mechanisms of ribbon synapses. Complexin 3 stabilizes the SNARE complex, preventing spontaneous vesicle fusion in the absence of calcium influx and facilitating neurotransmitter release upon depolarization (Meyer2024Characterization; Bhoi2020The). Additionally, CPLX3 expression is regulated by the circadian clock, optimizing visual function under varying light conditions (Bhoi2020The). Beyond its role in synaptic transmission, complexin 3 may also participate in broader cellular processes, such as endosomal recycling and cytoskeletal organization (Meyer2024Characterization).

## Structure
Complexin 3 (CPLX3) is a protein involved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Its primary structure is defined by a specific sequence of amino acids. The secondary structure of CPLX3 typically includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which contribute to its functional conformation. The tertiary structure refers to the overall three-dimensional shape of the protein, which is crucial for its interaction with other molecules in the synaptic vesicle exocytosis pathway. CPLX3 may also form a quaternary structure through the assembly of multiple protein subunits, although specific details on this aspect are not provided.

CPLX3 contains distinct domains such as the accessory helix and central helix, which are important for its role in synaptic function. These domains may facilitate the protein's interaction with other components of the exocytosis machinery. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can occur in CPLX3, potentially influencing its activity or localization within the cell. Additionally, splice variant isoforms of CPLX3 may exist, which could alter its function or localization, providing a mechanism for the regulation of its activity in different cellular contexts.

## Function
Complexin 3 (CPLX3) is a protein that plays a critical role in the regulation of neurotransmitter release at synapses, particularly in the retina. It is involved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis by interacting with the SNARE complex, a key component in the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane. CPLX3 acts as a modulator, stabilizing the SNARE complex and preventing spontaneous vesicle fusion in the absence of calcium influx, while facilitating transmitter release upon depolarization (Meyer2024Characterization; Bhoi2020The).

CPLX3 is primarily expressed in the retina, especially in cone photoreceptor terminals and rod bipolar cells, where it contributes to the unique release machinery of ribbon synapses. This protein is crucial for maintaining the balance between evoked and spontaneous neurotransmitter release, ensuring efficient synaptic transmission (Meyer2024Characterization). The expression of CPLX3 is regulated by the circadian clock, with higher levels during the day, which optimizes cone-driven vision under daylight conditions (Bhoi2020The).

In addition to its role in the retina, CPLX3 may also be involved in endosomal recycling pathways and potentially in endo-lysosomal degradation or retrograde transport to the trans-Golgi network, indicating a broader role in cellular processes beyond synaptic transmission (Meyer2024Characterization).

## Interactions
Complexin 3 (CPLX3) is involved in various protein interactions, primarily within the SNARE protein network, which is crucial for synaptic vesicle fusion. CPLX3 interacts with SNARE proteins such as Syntaxin 1 (Stx1AB), SNAP25, and Synaptobrevin 2, which are essential components of the neuronal SNARE complex (Meyer2024Characterization). These interactions are facilitated by the conserved central α helix of CPLX3, which binds to the SNARE complex, modulating its assembly and function (Meyer2024Characterization).

In ribbon synapses, CPLX3 specifically interacts with the t-SNARE protein Stx3b, suggesting a role in SNARE-mediated exocytosis in these specialized synapses (Meyer2024Characterization). Although attempts to confirm interactions with the synaptic ribbon protein RIBEYE were unsuccessful, previous studies indicate a potential role for CPLX3 in synaptic vesicle tethering and neurotransmitter release at ribbon synapses (Meyer2024Characterization).

CPLX3 also shows interactions with proteins involved in cytoskeletal organization, such as those associated with 'cytoskeleton organization' and 'regulation of actin cytoskeleton' (Meyer2024Characterization). These interactions suggest that CPLX3 may have roles beyond synaptic exocytosis, potentially contributing to the structural organization within synapses.
