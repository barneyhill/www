# SCRIB

## Overview
The SCRIB gene encodes the scribble planar cell polarity protein, a crucial scaffolding protein involved in maintaining cell polarity and tissue architecture. As a member of the LAP protein family, Scribble is characterized by its multi-domain structure, including leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and PDZ domains, which facilitate its role in organizing multiprotein complexes at cell junctions and the plasma membrane (Kallay2006Scribble; Bonello2018Scribble:). Scribble is integral to various cellular processes, such as apical-basal polarity, epithelial integrity, and synaptogenesis, and acts as a tumor suppressor by regulating cell proliferation (Bonello2018Scribble:). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as β-spectrins and components of the Hippo signaling pathway, underscore its role in maintaining cellular organization and preventing uncontrolled growth (Bonello2018Scribble:; Boëda2015Spectrin). Mutations in SCRIB are associated with developmental and neurological disorders, highlighting its importance in normal neuronal development and function (Robinson2011Mutations; Ezan2021Early).

## Structure
The SCRIB protein is a member of the LAP protein family and is characterized by its multi-domain structure, which includes leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and PDZ domains. The primary structure of SCRIB consists of 16 LRRs at the N-terminus, followed by a LAP-specific domain, a linker region, four non-identical PDZ domains, and a substantial C-terminus (Kallay2006Scribble). The LRR domains are crucial for cortical targeting and membrane association, while the PDZ domains facilitate interactions with various proteins, often binding to the C-terminus of partner proteins (Kallay2006Scribble; Bonello2018Scribble:).

The secondary structure of SCRIB includes typical PDZ domain folds, which consist of a six-stranded β-sheet and two α-helices forming a β-sandwich structure (How2020Structural). These domains are involved in binding interactions with proteins such as Vangl2, where the PDZ domains adopt a conserved mode of peptide engagement (How2020Structural).

SCRIB's tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains into a three-dimensional shape that allows for specific protein-protein interactions. The quaternary structure may involve interactions with other proteins, forming complexes essential for cell polarity and signaling (Javorsky2022Structural).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can affect SCRIB's function and localization, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. Splice variants may result in different isoforms with distinct functions, but specific variants are not mentioned in the context.

## Function
The SCRIB gene encodes the Scribble protein, a crucial component in maintaining cell polarity and tissue architecture in healthy human cells. Scribble is a multidomain scaffolding protein that plays a significant role in organizing and positioning multiprotein complexes at specific subcellular locations, particularly at cell junctions and the plasma membrane (Bonello2018Scribble:). It is involved in key cellular functions such as apical-basal polarity, epithelial integrity, synaptogenesis, and proliferation regulation (Bonello2018Scribble:).

Scribble interacts with several proteins at adherens and tight junctions, including ZO-1, DLG5, and β-catenin, through its PDZ domains, which are essential for the organization and function of cell junctions (Bonello2018Scribble:). It also plays a role in synaptogenesis by participating in the trafficking and recycling of NMDA receptors to the membrane (Bonello2018Scribble:). In the context of cell proliferation, Scribble acts as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating entry into the S phase of the cell cycle, thereby controlling cell growth (Bonello2018Scribble:).

Scribble is also involved in the Hippo signaling pathway, interacting with components such as Fat1 and LATS1/2 to control the phosphorylation and activity of transcriptional coactivators like TAZ and YAP, which helps maintain proper cell proliferation and prevents uncontrolled growth (Bonello2018Scribble:). In mammals, Scribble's role extends to regulating epithelial organization and spindle orientation, affecting processes like neural development and synaptic plasticity (Bonello2018Scribble:).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SCRIB gene are associated with several developmental and neurological disorders. SCRIB mutations have been linked to neural tube defects (NTDs), including craniorachischisis and spina bifida, which result from failures in neural tube closure during embryonic development (Robinson2011Mutations; Lei2013Mutations). These mutations can affect the subcellular localization of the SCRIB protein, potentially disrupting its normal function in planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling (Lei2013Mutations).

SCRIB is also implicated in Van der Woude syndrome (VRJS), characterized by features such as dysmorphic facial features, cardiac defects, and neurological issues like delayed psychomotor development and seizures (Ezan2022NeuronSpecific). The gene's role in brain development is further highlighted by its association with microcephaly, corpus callosum agenesis, and other neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Sans2016Planar; Ezan2021Early).

In addition to its role in developmental disorders, SCRIB mutations have been linked to altered synaptic function and dendritic development, contributing to conditions like intellectual disabilities and ASDs (Sans2016Planar). These findings underscore the critical role of SCRIB in maintaining normal neuronal development and function.

## Interactions
The SCRIB protein, also known as Scribble, is involved in numerous protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cell polarity and tumor suppression. SCRIB interacts with β-spectrins, specifically β2-spectrin (SPTBN1) and β3-spectrin (SPTBN2), through its C-terminal domain. This interaction is essential for SCRIB's localization at the cell cortex and its function in cell polarity (Boëda2015Spectrin). SCRIB also forms complexes with the cytoplasmic protein Lethal giant larvae2 (Lgl2) and the membrane protein Vangl2, with the LRR domain binding to Lgl2 and specific PDZ domains interacting with Vangl2 (Kallay2006Scribble).

SCRIB interacts with the zyxin-related protein LPP, although this interaction does not influence their localization to cell-cell contacts (Petit2005The). It also forms a complex with NOS1AP and VANGL1, which is important for cell polarity and migration, particularly in the context of cancer progression (Anastas2011A). Additionally, SCRIB is involved in a complex with ARHGEF7, PAK, and GIT proteins, and it interacts with planar cell polarity pathway components such as VANGL1 and VANGL2 (Anastas2011A). These interactions highlight SCRIB's role as a scaffold protein, organizing macromolecular complexes to regulate various cellular processes.
