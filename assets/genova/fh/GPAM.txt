# GPAM

## Overview
The GPAM gene encodes the enzyme glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, mitochondrial, which is a critical component of lipid metabolism. This enzyme is categorized as an acyltransferase and is primarily involved in the biosynthesis of glycerolipids by catalyzing the conversion of glycerol-3-phosphate into lysophosphatidic acid, a precursor for triglycerides and phospholipids. These lipids are essential for energy storage and maintaining cellular membrane integrity (Brockmöller2011Integration). GPAM is localized in the mitochondria, where it plays a significant role in regulating lipid homeostasis and energy metabolism, impacting various cellular functions and signaling pathways (Yang2022Downregulation). The gene's expression has been linked to clinical outcomes in breast cancer, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker (Brockmöller2011Integration).

## Function
GPAM (glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, mitochondrial) is a key enzyme involved in lipid biosynthesis, specifically catalyzing the initial step in the synthesis of glycerolipids. It converts glycerol-3-phosphate into lysophosphatidic acid, a precursor for the formation of triglycerides and phospholipids, which are essential for energy storage and membrane structure (Brockmöller2011Integration). This enzymatic activity is crucial for maintaining cellular energy metabolism and lipid homeostasis, as it influences the balance of lipid synthesis and degradation within the cell (Zhao2023Regulation).

GPAM is active in the mitochondria, where it plays a significant role in the regulation of lipid metabolism. Its activity affects the levels of various lipid intermediates, such as triacylglycerol, lysophosphatidic acid, phosphatidic acid, and diacylglycerol, which are important for cellular functions and signaling pathways (Yang2022Downregulation). The enzyme's function is not only pivotal for lipid biosynthesis but also impacts broader physiological processes, including energy storage and membrane dynamics, which are vital for normal cellular function and organismal health (Brockmöller2011Integration).

## Clinical Significance
The GPAM gene, encoding glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, mitochondrial, plays a significant role in lipid metabolism, and its expression has been linked to various clinical outcomes in breast cancer. High cytoplasmic expression of GPAM is associated with hormone receptor-negative breast cancer, with 77.6% of hormone receptor-negative tumors showing elevated GPAM levels compared to 59.3% of hormone receptor-positive tumors. This expression pattern correlates with improved overall survival, as indicated by a univariate Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (Brockmöller2011Integration). 

GPAM expression also influences lipidomic and metabolic profiles in breast cancer, affecting phospholipid metabolism, particularly phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamines. These changes are largely independent of estrogen receptor status and tumor grade, suggesting a broader impact on breast cancer metabolism (Brockmöller2011Integration). 

The study by Brockmöller et al. highlights the potential prognostic role of GPAM expression in breast cancer, suggesting that alterations in GPAM expression could serve as a marker for disease progression and patient survival (Brockmöller2011Integration). However, the context does not provide specific information on GPAM gene mutations or their direct clinical significance in other diseases.
