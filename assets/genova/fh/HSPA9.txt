# HSPA9

## Overview
HSPA9 is a gene that encodes the protein known as mortalin, a member of the heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) family, which functions as a molecular chaperone. Mortalin is primarily localized in the mitochondria but is also present in other cellular compartments, where it plays a critical role in maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular homeostasis. As a chaperone, mortalin is involved in protein import, folding, and degradation within the mitochondria, and it is essential for regulating oxidative stress and energy production. The protein's interactions with various cellular components, including the tumor suppressor protein p53, highlight its involvement in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, making it a significant player in cancer biology. Mutations in the HSPA9 gene have been linked to several diseases, including mitochondrial chaperonopathies and cancer, underscoring its clinical significance (RoyerBertrand2015Mutations; Jang2024HSPA9; Elwakeel2022Abrogating).

## Structure
The HSPA9 gene encodes a protein known as mortalin, which is a member of the Hsp70 family of chaperones. Mortalin is a 74-kDa protein primarily localized to the mitochondria but also found in other subcellular compartments (Elwakeel2022Abrogating). Structurally, mortalin consists of a 42-kD N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and a 25-kD C-terminal substrate-binding domain (SBD). The NBD is divided into four subdomains (IA, IB, IIA, and IIB) that form the nucleotide-binding pocket, while the SBD is further divided into a β-sandwich domain (SBDβ) and a 12-kD α-helical lid domain (SBDα) (Elwakeel2022Abrogating).

The substrate-binding site of mortalin has specificity for mixed basic hydrophobic peptide sequences and is contained within the SBDβ. The SBDα acts as a 'lid' covering the peptide binding site in the high substrate-affinity ADP-bound state. Upon ADP-ATP exchange, the SBDα undergoes a conformational change, leaving the peptide binding site open and returning mortalin to the ATP-apo state (Elwakeel2022Abrogating). The crystal structures of mortalin's SBD (SBDβ with the first two helices of the SBDα) and NBD have been solved, but its full 3D crystal structure has not yet been resolved (Elwakeel2022Abrogating).

## Function
HSPA9, also known as mortalin, is a mitochondrial chaperone protein that is part of the heat shock protein 70 family. It plays a crucial role in several mitochondrial processes, including protein import, folding, and degradation. HSPA9 is essential for maintaining mitochondrial dynamics and homeostasis, regulating oxidative stress, and ensuring proper energy generation and intracellular transport (Jang2024HSPA9). 

In healthy human cells, HSPA9 is predominantly located in the mitochondria but is also found in the cytoplasm and centrosome. It is involved in the translocase of the inner mitochondrial membrane complex, supplying ATP power to import proteins through the inner mitochondrial membrane (Chen2011Knockdown). HSPA9 also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein TP53, regulating its activity and influencing apoptosis and cell cycle control (Liu2017Knockdown). 

HSPA9's role extends to the regulation of cellular stress responses, where it helps maintain cellular homeostasis and prevents inappropriate cell death (Liu2017Knockdown). Its deficiency can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, increased oxidative stress, and apoptosis, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular and mitochondrial health (Jang2024HSPA9).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the HSPA9 gene, also known as mortalin, have been implicated in several diseases. Mutations in HSPA9 are associated with EVEN-PLUS syndrome, a condition characterized by congenital malformations and skeletal dysplasia. This syndrome shares features with CODAS syndrome, which is caused by mutations in the LONP1 gene, suggesting a group of disorders termed 'mitochondrial chaperonopathies' (RoyerBertrand2015Mutations). Specific mutations such as R126W and Y128C in HSPA9 affect the protein's structure and function, potentially disrupting its role in mitochondrial protein import and folding, leading to developmental defects (RoyerBertrand2015Mutations).

In cancer, HSPA9 is often overexpressed and plays a role in tumor progression. It is involved in the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway, where it acts as a negative regulator of tumor-suppressive signaling. This overexpression is observed in various cancers, including melanoma, and is associated with increased cell survival and proliferation (Wu2013A). In prostate cancer, the GRP75-USP1-SIX1 protein complex, involving HSPA9, contributes to tumor growth and castration resistance, suggesting that targeting this complex could offer new therapeutic strategies (Liao2021A).

## Interactions
HSPA9, also known as mortalin, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, sequestering it in the cytoplasm and preventing its nuclear translocation, which inactivates p53's tumor-suppressive functions. This interaction is significant in cancer cells, where mortalin is often overexpressed, contributing to oncogenesis (Elwakeel2022Abrogating). Several compounds, such as SHetA2 and Az-TPP-O3, have been studied for their ability to disrupt the mortalin-p53 interaction, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Elwakeel2022Abrogating).

HSPA9 also interacts with MEK1/2, acting as a negative regulator of the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway, which is involved in cell cycle regulation and oncogene-induced senescence. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of p21 CIP1 levels, affecting cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells (Wu2013A).

Additionally, HSPA9 interacts with the endoplasmic reticulum protein TXNDC5, suggesting a role in ER-mitochondrial crosstalk and the regulation of oxidative stress and lipid metabolism (Bidooki2023Endoplasmic). These interactions underscore HSPA9's involvement in various cellular pathways and its potential impact on cancer progression.
