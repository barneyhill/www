# AMHR2

## Overview
The AMHR2 gene encodes the anti-Müllerian hormone receptor type 2, a transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptor that plays a pivotal role in reproductive system development and function. This receptor is integral to the signaling pathway of the anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) family, and is crucial for the regression of Müllerian ducts in male embryos, thereby facilitating normal male reproductive tract development (Howard2022Molecular; Josso2003Transduction). In females, AMHR2 is involved in the regulation of ovarian follicle development, acting as a negative regulator of folliculogenesis and influencing conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) (Cate2022Anti-Müllerian; Howard2022Molecular). The receptor's structure includes an extracellular domain for AMH binding, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain with kinase activity, which are essential for its function in mediating AMH effects in the gonads and reproductive organs (Cate2022Anti-Müllerian; Josso2003Transduction).

## Structure
The AMHR2 protein is a transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptor involved in reproductive system development. It consists of 573 amino acids and includes a signal sequence, an N-terminal extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain with serine/threonine kinase activity (Cate2022Anti-Müllerian). The extracellular domain adopts a three-finger toxin fold, characterized by three anti-parallel beta strand fingers and a central palm region, and contains four disulfide bridges (Cate2022Anti-Müllerian; Howard2022Molecular). This domain is crucial for binding the anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), with specific interactions involving the palm of the receptor and the knuckles of the ligand (Howard2022Molecular).

The intracellular domain is structured as a two-domain kinase, which is typical for receptors in the TGF-b family (Cate2022Anti-Müllerian). AMHR2 undergoes non-covalent homooligomerization at the plasma membrane, which is a form of quaternary structure (Cate2022Anti-Müllerian). Post-translational modifications include phosphorylation, which is common for kinase receptors (Cate2022Anti-Müllerian). Splice variants of AMHR2 have been identified, potentially influencing its regulatory functions in the AMH signaling pathway (Howard2022Molecular).

## Function
The AMHR2 gene encodes the anti-Müllerian hormone receptor type 2, a critical component of the signaling pathway for the anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), which is part of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) family. This receptor is essential for the regression of the Müllerian ducts during male embryonic development, a process necessary for the normal development of the male reproductive tract (Howard2022Molecular; Josso2003Transduction). In males, AMHR2 is expressed in the mesenchyme of the Müllerian duct, facilitating its regression through apoptosis and epithelial to mesenchymal transformation (Cate2022Anti-Müllerian).

In females, AMHR2 is involved in ovarian follicle development, acting as a negative regulator of folliculogenesis. It inhibits the recruitment of primordial follicles and affects follicle-stimulating hormone responsiveness, playing a role in conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) (Cate2022Anti-Müllerian; Howard2022Molecular). The receptor is a transmembrane serine/threonine kinase, with an extracellular domain that binds AMH, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain responsible for kinase activity (Cate2022Anti-Müllerian; Josso2003Transduction). AMHR2 is primarily active in the gonads and reproductive organs, where it mediates the effects of AMH (Josso2003Transduction).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AMHR2 gene are primarily associated with Persistent Müllerian Duct Syndrome (PMDS), a rare disorder of sex development. PMDS is characterized by the presence of Müllerian duct structures, such as a uterus and fallopian tubes, in individuals with a 46,XY karyotype, who otherwise exhibit normal male sexual differentiation. This condition arises due to mutations that impair the function of the anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) signaling pathway, which is crucial for the regression of these structures during fetal development (Josso2005AMH; Unal2018A; Picard2019Persistent).

Mutations in AMHR2 can lead to a variety of clinical presentations, including bilateral cryptorchidism, unilateral cryptorchidism with a contralateral hernia, and transverse testicular ectopia. These mutations are often inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and can result in infertility due to improper testicular positioning and potential damage during surgical interventions (Liu2022Identification; Fang2021A).

In addition to PMDS, alterations in AMHR2 expression or function have been implicated in primary ovarian insufficiency (POI). Specific mutations, such as I209N, have been shown to disrupt AMH signaling, which is essential for ovarian follicle development, potentially contributing to the pathogenesis of POI (Li2016A).

## Interactions
The anti-Müllerian hormone receptor type 2 (AMHR2) is involved in several specific protein interactions that are crucial for its signaling functions. AMHR2 interacts with the anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) to regulate various biological processes. This interaction is highly specific, requiring the cleavage of AMH for effective binding to AMHR2, as only cleaved AMH can efficiently bind to the receptor (di2010Processing). The binding of AMH to AMHR2 leads to the dissociation of the pro-region from the C-terminal homodimer of AMH, a mechanism distinct from other TGF-β family ligands (di2010Processing).

AMHR2 also forms complexes with type I receptors, such as BMPR-IB (ALK6), in a ligand-dependent manner. This interaction is essential for activating the BMP-specific Smad1 signaling pathway, which is crucial for the transcription of target genes (Gouédard2000Engagement). The receptor can oligomerize, forming homomeric complexes at the plasma membrane, which may serve as a mechanism of negative regulation (Hirschhorn2015Constitutive). AMHR2's interaction with AMH and its oligomerization behavior are key to its role in signaling pathways related to sexual differentiation and reproductive functions.
