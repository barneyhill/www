# IAH1

## Overview
The IAH1 gene encodes the protein isoamyl acetate hydrolyzing esterase 1 (putative), which is involved in the hydrolysis of ester bonds, specifically targeting isoamyl acetate. This protein is categorized as an esterase, a type of enzyme that catalyzes the cleavage of ester bonds, playing a crucial role in various metabolic pathways. The activity of the IAH1-encoded protein is significant in the context of cellular metabolism and biochemical processes, where it may influence the balance of ester compounds within the cell. Understanding the function and regulation of the IAH1 gene and its protein product is essential for elucidating its role in metabolic pathways and potential implications in health and disease.
