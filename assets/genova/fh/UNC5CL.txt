# UNC5CL

## Overview
UNC5CL is a gene that encodes the protein unc-5 family C-terminal like, which is a membrane-anchored protein involved in cellular signaling pathways, particularly those related to inflammation and immunity. The protein is characterized by a ZU5-UPA-DD supramodule, including a transmembrane domain and a cytosolic death domain, which is crucial for its function in activating NF-kB and JNK signaling pathways (Heinz2011The). UNC5CL functions as a MyD88-independent activator of the IRAK signaling cascade, playing a significant role in pro-inflammatory responses and epithelial barrier function (Heinz2011The). It is predominantly expressed in mucosal tissues, such as the small intestine, and is implicated in various diseases, including inflammatory bowel diseases and certain cancers, due to its role in immune response regulation and potential involvement in chemotherapy resistance (Sun2024Identification; Heinz2011The).

## Structure
The UNC5CL protein is characterized by a domain organization that includes ZU5, UPA, and death domains (DD), forming a ZU5-UPA-DD supramodule. This structure is similar to the intracellular fragments of the Unc5-receptor family, suggesting a conserved functional role. The protein is membrane-anchored, with a transmembrane domain located at the N-terminal, and the C-terminal death domain exposed to the cytosol (Heinz2011The). The secondary structure of UNC5CL has been predicted to share a 34% sequence similarity with the rat Unc5B intracellular domains, indicating conservation of most secondary structures (Heinz2011The).

UNC5CL undergoes autoproteolytic processing at an HFS site, a feature it shares with proteins like Nup98 and PIDD. This processing, however, is not required for its signaling function (Heinz2011The). Variants of UNC5CL, such as those at position 432, exhibit different potencies in activating NF-kB, with the 432G variant being less potent than the 432R variant (Heinz2011The). The protein's function is independent of its autoproteolytic cleavage, as mutations affecting the cleavage site do not impact NF-kB activation (Heinz2011The).

## Function
UNC5CL is a protein involved in cellular signaling pathways, particularly in pro-inflammatory responses. It acts as a MyD88-independent activator of the IRAK signaling cascade, leading to the activation of NF-kB and JNK, which are crucial for signal transduction events in inflammation and immunity (Heinz2011The). UNC5CL is predominantly expressed in mucosal tissues, such as the small intestine, where it is localized in microvilli-like structures on the apical face of epithelial cells (Heinz2011The). This localization suggests a role in epithelial barrier function and immune responses against pathogens (Heinz2011The).

The protein contains a death domain (DD) that is essential for its NF-kB-inducing capacity, and it interacts with IRAK family members, but not MyD88, indicating a unique signaling pathway parallel to the TLR/IL-1R system (Heinz2011The). UNC5CL is also involved in the transcriptional activation of chemokines such as IL-8, CXCL1, and CCL20, which are important in inflammatory responses (Heinz2011The). Its role in these processes suggests that UNC5CL may contribute to the regulation of immune responses and maintenance of mucosal integrity.

## Clinical Significance
UNC5CL has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in pro-inflammatory signaling and cancer progression. In inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, UNC5CL is specifically expressed in mucosal epithelia and activates pro-inflammatory pathways, suggesting a potential causal role in these chronic inflammatory disorders (Heinz2011The). 

In cancer, UNC5CL has been identified as a hub gene associated with chemotherapy resistance in bladder cancer. It is linked to metabolic processes that may contribute to the progression of bladder cancer and resistance to drugs like gemcitabine (Sun2024Identification). Variants of UNC5CL have also been associated with susceptibility to oral squamous cell carcinoma in genome-wide association studies (Sun2024Identification). 

Additionally, UNC5CL is involved in esophageal cancer, where it is regulated by specific microRNAs and may serve as a potential molecular target for treatment (Zhong2020Screening). Its role in Alzheimer's disease has been suggested through its association with neuropathologic changes in certain populations (Ray2023Extended). These findings highlight UNC5CL's significance in various pathological conditions, warranting further research into its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
UNC5CL is involved in several protein interactions that play a role in signaling pathways. It is a novel activator of the IRAK signaling cascade, which is independent of MyD88. UNC5CL interacts with IRAK1 and IRAK4, essential components for the activation of NF-kB and JNK signaling pathways. These interactions are crucial for the phosphorylation of IkBa and JNK1, leading to the activation of pro-inflammatory responses (Heinz2011The). The protein's death domain (DD) is important for its function, as it provides an assembly platform for IRAKs, facilitating the initiation of signaling cascades (Heinz2011The).

UNC5CL's interaction with IRAK1 and IRAK4 has been demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, which showed that different variants of UNC5CL (432G and 432R) have varying affinities for these interactions. This suggests that the differences in activity between UNC5CL variants may be due to their differing affinities for IRAKs (Heinz2011The). The protein is also involved in the recruitment of modified forms of IRAK1 and TRAF6, further indicating its role in a MyD88-independent signaling pathway (Heinz2011The). These interactions highlight UNC5CL's role in epithelial immune responses and its potential involvement in mucosal diseases.
