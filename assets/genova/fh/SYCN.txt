# SYCN

## Overview
The SYCN gene encodes the protein syncollin, which is predominantly expressed in the exocrine pancreas. Syncollin is a membrane-associated protein that plays a critical role in the exocytosis of pancreatic acinar cells by facilitating the fusion of zymogen granules with the plasma membrane and with each other, a process known as compound exocytosis (WÄSLE2005Syncollin). This protein is characterized by its ability to form oligomeric structures, such as dimers and hexamers, and is associated with cholesterol-enriched lipid microdomains within the granule membrane (HODEL2001Cholesteroldependent; KALUS2002Interaction). Syncollin's interaction with other proteins, such as GP-2, and its role in vesicle stability and secretion processes underscore its importance in maintaining normal pancreatic function and potentially in other secretory pathways (WÄSLE2004Syncollin; KALUS2002Interaction).

## Structure
Syncollin is a protein associated with the pancreatic zymogen granule membrane, with a predicted molecular mass of 13 kDa, but it migrates as a 16 kDa band on SDS-PAGE due to its oligomeric nature (HODEL2001Cholesteroldependent). The protein can form higher-order structures, including oligomers such as dimers and hexamers, with observed bands at approximately 55, 100, and 34 kDa, suggesting the presence of monomers, dimers, and hexamers (HODEL2001Cholesteroldependent). Syncollin is known to form homo-oligomers, likely hexamers, which are resistant to extraction in high-salt buffer solutions but can be removed under alkaline conditions when it becomes monomerized (WÄSLE2005Syncollin). 

Syncollin's association with the membrane is cholesterol-dependent, and it is found in cholesterol-enriched, detergent-insoluble complexes, indicating its interaction with lipid microdomains or rafts (KALUS2002Interaction). The protein's interaction with the membrane is further stabilized by electrostatic interactions with other proteins or phospholipids (HODEL2001Cholesteroldependent). Syncollin also interacts with GP-2, a major membrane protein of pancreatic zymogen granules, forming a complex with a molecular mass of approximately 120 kDa (KALUS2002Interaction).

## Function
Syncollin (SYCN) is a protein primarily expressed in the exocrine pancreas, where it plays a crucial role in the process of exocytosis in pancreatic acinar cells. It is predominantly associated with the luminal surface of zymogen granule membranes, facilitating the fusion of these granules with the plasma membrane and with each other, a process known as compound exocytosis. This function is essential for the efficient secretion of digestive enzymes, such as amylase, into the digestive tract (WÄSLE2005Syncollin).

In syncollin knockout (KO) mice, the absence of syncollin leads to a significant reduction in exocytotic events, particularly affecting secondary fusion events between zymogen granules. This results in impaired enzyme secretion and pancreatic hypertrophy, indicating syncollin's critical role in maintaining normal pancreatic function (WÄSLE2005Syncollin).

Syncollin is also involved in the regulation of vesicle stability and secretion processes in other cell types. In AtT-20 cells, a model for corticotropin-secreting cells, syncollin inhibits regulated corticotropin secretion by reducing the population of secretory vesicles, suggesting a role in modulating vesicle stability through membrane interactions (WÄSLE2004Syncollin).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
Syncollin (SYCN) is known to interact with several proteins within the pancreatic zymogen granules. It directly interacts with GP-2, a major glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored membrane glycoprotein of the granules. This interaction was confirmed through cross-linking experiments using both purified and recombinant GP-2, indicating a specific binding relationship between syncollin and GP-2 (KALUS2002Interaction). Syncollin also forms homooligomers, as it can be cross-linked to itself, suggesting that it may form oligomeric structures within the granule membrane (KALUS2002Interaction).

Syncollin is associated with lipid microdomains, or rafts, in the granule membrane, which are enriched in cholesterol and sphingomyelin. These microdomains also contain GP-2, ZG16p, sulphated matrix proteoglycans, and SNARE proteins like syntaxin 3 and synaptobrevin 2, indicating that syncollin may play a role in the organization of these complexes and in signal transduction across the granule membrane (KALUS2002Interaction). The interaction of syncollin with these lipid rafts is cholesterol-dependent, highlighting its role in the structural integrity and function of the granule membrane (KALUS2002Interaction).
