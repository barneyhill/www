# TOP2B

## Overview
The TOP2B gene encodes the enzyme DNA topoisomerase II beta, a critical component in the regulation of DNA topology. This enzyme is classified as a type II topoisomerase and is essential for managing DNA supercoiling and entanglements during transcription and replication processes. DNA topoisomerase II beta functions by introducing transient double-strand breaks in DNA, facilitating the relaxation of supercoiled DNA and enabling proper chromatin organization and gene expression. It plays a significant role in the formation of topologically associating domains (TADs) and interacts with various chromatin architectural proteins, such as CTCF and cohesin, to maintain genome architecture. The enzyme is also involved in transcriptional regulation, particularly in response to hormonal and other stimuli, by enabling rapid chromatin reconfiguration. Mutations in the TOP2B gene have been linked to several neurodevelopmental disorders and hereditary hearing loss, highlighting its importance in neural and auditory functions (Cowell2023To; Papapietro2022Topoisomerase; Xia2019Mutations).

## Structure
The human gene TOP2B encodes the enzyme DNA topoisomerase II beta, which plays a crucial role in altering DNA topology by creating transient double-strand breaks. The primary structure of TOP2B consists of a sequence of amino acids that form several key domains, including the ATPase domain and the DNA-binding domain. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to the enzyme's functional conformation (Bartas2023Extensive).

The tertiary structure of TOP2B forms a complex three-dimensional shape, essential for its enzymatic activity. The quaternary structure involves dimerization, which is critical for the enzyme's function in DNA cleavage and religation (Bartas2023Extensive). The enzyme's catalytic mechanism involves a 3-gate isomerase process, where a double-helical DNA segment binds to the topoII homodimer, is bent, cleaved, and results in covalent protein-DNA intermediates marking a double-strand break (Bartas2023Extensive).

TOP2B contains several functional regions, including the N-terminal N-gate/ATPase, the DNA-gate, and the C-gate. The C-terminal domains (CTDs) are largely unstructured and are believed to fulfill regulatory and targeting roles (Bartas2023Extensive). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can regulate the activity of TOP2B, affecting its function and localization (Bartas2023Extensive).

## Function
TOP2B (DNA topoisomerase II beta) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in managing DNA topology in healthy human cells. It functions by introducing transient double-strand breaks in DNA, which helps alleviate supercoiling and untangle DNA strands during transcription and replication processes (Cowell2023To; Papapietro2022Topoisomerase). This activity is essential for the release of paused RNA polymerase II at gene promoters, facilitating transcription elongation, particularly for long genes and hormone-sensitive genes (Cowell2023To; Papapietro2022Topoisomerase).

TOP2B is involved in the formation of topologically associating domains (TADs) and DNA loops, which are crucial for genome organization and long-distance gene regulation. It interacts with chromatin architectural proteins like CTCF and cohesin, contributing to the maintenance of genome architecture and preventing unwanted gene interactions across domains (Cowell2023To; Papapietro2022Topoisomerase). The enzyme is also implicated in the transcriptional regulation of stimulus-responsive genes, where it facilitates rapid chromatin reconfiguration and transcriptional induction by generating transient DNA double-strand breaks (Madabhushi2018The).

TOP2B's activity is associated with active promoters and enhancers, and it co-localizes with tissue-specific transcription factors and chromatin remodelers, highlighting its diverse roles in gene expression and cell differentiation (Cowell2023To; Papapietro2022Topoisomerase).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TOP2B gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental and neurological disorders. Mutations in TOP2B have been linked to autism spectrum disorder, global developmental delay, and intellectual disability. A specific mutation, H58Y, affects the nuclear dynamics of TOP2B, reducing its mobility and potentially disrupting gene expression patterns during neural development, which may contribute to conditions such as autism (MorotomiYano2022Diseaseassociated; Lam2017Global). 

TOP2B is also crucial for proper neuronal differentiation and connectivity. Its dysfunction can lead to severe neurological defects, including improper neuronal migration and respiratory failure, as observed in mouse models (Madabhushi2018The). In humans, mutations in TOP2B have been associated with developmental delay, intellectual disability, hypotonia, progressive microcephaly, and autistic features (Madabhushi2018The).

In addition to its role in neural development, mutations in TOP2B are implicated in autosomal-dominant hereditary hearing loss. These mutations inhibit the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, affecting cell proliferation and leading to defects in inner ear development (Xia2019Mutations). The gene's involvement in these pathways underscores its importance in both auditory and neural functions.

## Interactions
TOP2B (DNA topoisomerase II beta) is involved in numerous protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions that are crucial for its role in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling. It interacts with several proteins, including transcription factors such as CTCF, MYCN, and nuclear hormone receptors like RARA, AR, ESR1, and ESR2, which suggests its involvement in transcriptional regulation (Cowell2023To). TOP2B is also part of complexes with chromatin remodeling proteins, including the BAF, WINAC, and FACT complexes, which help manage torsional stress during chromatin remodeling (Cowell2023To).

TOP2B interacts with components of the cohesin complex and CTCF at topological domain borders, playing a role in chromosomal organization and DNA supercoiling (UuskülaReimand2016Topoisomerase). It is associated with open chromatin regions and active gene regulatory sites, often co-occupying these regions with CTCF and cohesin, which is linked to stronger ChIP-seq signals and evolutionary conservation (UuskülaReimand2016Topoisomerase).

The protein also forms part of a complex with DNA repair proteins such as DNA-PK, KU70, KU80, and PARP1, which are recruited to promoter regions of inducible genes, potentially involved in the repair of promoter-associated double-strand breaks (Cowell2023To). These interactions highlight TOP2B's multifaceted role in transcriptional regulation and chromatin dynamics.
