# ZNF225

## Overview
ZNF225 is a human gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 225, a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs. These motifs are typically involved in binding to DNA, RNA, or other proteins, and play a crucial role in regulating gene expression. Zinc finger protein 225 is primarily involved in transcriptional regulation, acting as a transcription factor that can influence the expression of various genes. The specific biological functions and pathways regulated by ZNF225 are still under investigation, but its role in gene expression suggests it may be involved in critical cellular processes such as development, differentiation, and possibly disease states (Qiu2020aarFDC).
