# ANKRD13C

## Overview
ANKRD13C is a gene that encodes the ankyrin repeat domain 13C protein, a member of the ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein family. This protein is characterized by its ankyrin repeat domains, which are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions. Unlike other proteins in the ANKRD13 family, ankyrin repeat domain 13C lacks ubiquitin-interacting motifs, suggesting a unique functional role distinct from its family members, particularly in the regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway (Mattioni2020Ring). The protein is localized to the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum membranes, hinting at its involvement in ER-associated processes (Mattioni2020Ring). While its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated, ANKRD13C is implicated in various cellular pathways, including those related to cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, and has been associated with several diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, ankylosing spondylitis, and renal clear cell carcinoma (Wang2022The; Ding2024Inflammatory).

## Function
ANKRD13C, a member of the ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein family, is involved in various cellular processes through its ankyrin repeat domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions. Unlike other members of the ANKRD13 family, ANKRD13C lacks ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) and does not interact with RNF11, a RING E3 ligase involved in ubiquitination processes (Mattioni2020Ring). This lack of interaction suggests that ANKRD13C may have a distinct role compared to its family members, which are involved in the regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway (Mattioni2020Ring).

ANKRD13C is localized at the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes, indicating a potential role in processes associated with the ER (Mattioni2020Ring). While the specific function of ANKRD13C in healthy human cells is not detailed, its unique localization and lack of interaction with RNF11 imply it may participate in different cellular pathways or functions, possibly related to cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Mattioni2020Ring). Further research is needed to elucidate its precise role in cellular and organismal biology.

## Clinical Significance
ANKRD13C has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through its mutations and alterations in expression. In the context of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS), ANKRD13C is identified as a protective gene. It plays a role in the biogenesis and exit of G protein-coupled receptors from the endoplasmic reticulum, although its specific association with these diseases beyond its molecular function is not fully detailed (Ding2024Inflammatory).

In renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), ANKRD13C is noted for showing copy number variation (CNV) loss, which may contribute to the disease's progression. The study suggests that alterations in anoikis-related genes, including ANKRD13C, are associated with poor prognosis in KIRC (Wang2022The).

ANKRD13C is also a target of hsa-miR-181a-5p, a microRNA involved in regulating cancer-related genes. While the specific diseases associated with ANKRD13C mutations are not detailed, its regulation by hsa-miR-181a-5p suggests a potential role in cancer pathways, including the Wnt and p53 signaling pathways, which are crucial in tumorigenesis (Zhou2015HsamicroRNA181a).
