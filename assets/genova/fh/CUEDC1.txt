# CUEDC1

## Overview
The CUEDC1 gene encodes the CUE domain containing 1 protein, which plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of cancer biology. This protein is characterized by its CUE domain, which is involved in ubiquitin-binding and protein-protein interactions. CUEDC1 is implicated in the regulation of signaling pathways such as the TGF-β1 and NF-κB pathways, influencing processes like epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis. It acts as a tumor suppressor in certain cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), by inhibiting EMT and metastasis through interactions with proteins like Smurf2. Conversely, in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CUEDC1 expression is elevated, and its knockdown can restrain tumor growth, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. Additionally, CUEDC1 is a key target of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) in breast cancer, underscoring its diverse roles in cancer progression and potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target (Unknownauthors2024KnockdownofCUEDC1restrainsthegrowthandmigrationofhepatocellularcarcinomacellsthroughaffectingtheTβRISmadsignalingpathway; Cui2020CUEDC1; Lopes2018CUEDC1).

## Clinical Significance
The CUEDC1 gene has been implicated in various cancers, with its expression levels and interactions playing significant roles in disease progression. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CUEDC1 expression is elevated, and its knockdown has been shown to restrain tumor growth and reduce cell migration and invasion. This effect is mediated through the activation of the transforming growth factor-β receptor I (TβRI)/Smad signaling pathway, suggesting that CUEDC1 could be a potential target for therapeutic interventions in HCC (Unknownauthors2024KnockdownofCUEDC1restrainsthegrowthandmigrationofhepatocellularcarcinomacellsthroughaffectingtheTβRISmadsignalingpathway).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), CUEDC1 acts as a tumor suppressor. Its expression is significantly downregulated in NSCLC tumor tissues, and this downregulation is associated with increased lymph node metastasis and poorer survival outcomes. CUEDC1 inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis by inactivating the TβRI/Smad signaling pathway, interacting with Smurf2, a protein involved in the degradation of TβRI and Smads (Cui2020CUEDC1).

In breast cancer, CUEDC1 is a primary target of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and is essential for the growth of ERα-positive breast cancer cells. Its expression is regulated by a specific enhancer, CUTE, which is crucial for CUEDC1 expression in response to ERα signaling (Lopes2018CUEDC1).

## Interactions
CUEDC1, a protein encoded by the human gene CUE domain containing 1, is involved in several significant protein interactions that influence cellular processes. One of the primary interactions of CUEDC1 is with Smurf2, a C2-WW-HECT E3 ligase. This interaction is crucial as CUEDC1 positively regulates Smurf2 expression, which in turn inhibits the TGF-β1 signaling pathway. This pathway is involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis, processes critical in cancer progression. The interaction between CUEDC1 and Smurf2 leads to the inactivation of the TβRI/Smad signaling pathway, thereby impairing EMT and metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Cui2020CUEDC1).

CUEDC1 also interacts with the IKK subunit, suggesting a potential role in inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway, although this requires further validation (Cui2020CUEDC1). Additionally, CUEDC1 influences the expression of several cell cycle and apoptosis-related proteins. It inhibits the expression of proteins such as Bcl-2, C-myc, CyclinD1, and CDK4, while promoting the expression of Bax, a proapoptotic gene, contributing to its role in suppressing tumor growth and metastasis in NSCLC (Cui2020CUEDC1).
