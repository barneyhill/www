# DERL1

## Overview
DERL1 is a gene that encodes the protein derlin-1, which is a crucial component of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. Derlin-1 is a transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in the retrotranslocation of misfolded proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cytosol, where they are targeted for degradation by the proteasome. This function is vital for maintaining cellular protein homeostasis and preventing ER stress-induced apoptosis. The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the unfolded protein response (UPR) and ER stress-induced preemptive quality control (ERpQC), which are essential for managing protein folding and lipid synthesis within the ER. Alterations in DERL1 expression have been linked to several diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its importance in both normal cellular function and disease pathology (Nishitoh2008ALSlinked; Sugiyama2022Chemical; Bai2024miR181c5pDERL1).

## Function
The DERL1 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. This protein is involved in the retrotranslocation of misfolded proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen to the cytosol, where they are ubiquitinated and subsequently degraded by the proteasome. This process is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis within cells and preventing ER stress-induced apoptosis (Nishitoh2008ALSlinked; Sugiyama2022Chemical).

In healthy cells, Derlin-1, the protein product of DERL1, is part of a complex that facilitates the recognition and transport of misfolded proteins. It works in conjunction with other proteins to ensure that these substrates are properly processed and degraded, thus maintaining cellular function and preventing the accumulation of potentially toxic protein aggregates (Nishitoh2008ALSlinked; Cai2022Derlin1).

Derlin-1 is also involved in the ER stress-induced preemptive quality control (ERpQC) system, which is crucial for managing protein folding and lipid synthesis within the ER. This role is vital for reducing ER stress through mechanisms like the unfolded protein response (UPR), which includes protein refolding and degradation (Sugiyama2022Chemical).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the DERL1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. In breast cancer, DERL1 is overexpressed across different subtypes and is associated with poor overall survival. Its overexpression promotes tumor growth and metastasis by activating the AKT signaling pathway through K63-linked ubiquitination, mediated by the E3 ligase TRAF6. This makes DERL1 a potential marker for diagnosis and a target for therapy in breast cancer (Bai2024miR181c5pDERL1).

In ovarian cancer, DERL1 overexpression is linked to copy number alterations (CNAs), contributing to cancer progression. The gene is part of a cluster of upregulated genes associated with extracellular matrix structural constituents and platelet-derived growth factor binding, highlighting its role in tumorigenesis (Giacomini2020A).

DERL1 also plays a significant role in neurological conditions. Its deficiency in mice leads to increased seizure susceptibility and cognitive dysfunction due to impaired adult neurogenesis. This is linked to decreased Stat5b expression and disrupted neural stem cell maintenance. Treatment with chemical chaperones like 4-phenylbutyric acid has shown potential in ameliorating these conditions by improving cholesterol biosynthesis and reducing ER stress (Sugiyama2022Chemical; Murao2023Homeostatic).

## Interactions
DERL1, also known as Derlin-1, is a key component in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, interacting with several proteins to facilitate the retrotranslocation of misfolded proteins from the ER to the cytosol. DERL1 forms a complex with the p97 ATPase (also known as VCP) and VIMP, a VCP-interacting membrane protein, which is crucial for the retrotranslocation process. This complex is involved in linking substrate recognition in the ER lumen to their movement through the membrane (Ye2004A).

DERL1 interacts with the ubiquitin ligase Hrd1, forming a complex that includes p97 and VIMP. This interaction does not require the E3 ligase activity of Hrd1, as an inactive variant still binds to DERL1 and p97 (Ye2005Recruitment). DERL1 also interacts with other ubiquitin ligases such as gp78/AMFR, suggesting the formation of membrane complexes (Ye2005Recruitment).

In the context of viral infection, DERL1 associates with US11, a viral protein that targets MHC class I heavy chains for retrotranslocation, indicating its role in immune evasion mechanisms (Ye2004A). DERL1 also interacts with TRAF6, an E3 ligase, to regulate AKT activation through K63-linked ubiquitination (Bai2024miR181c5pDERL1).
