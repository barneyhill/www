# LENG1

## Overview
The LENG1 gene encodes the protein leukocyte receptor cluster member 1, which is involved in various cellular processes. This protein is categorized as a receptor and is primarily expressed in leukocytes, playing a role in immune response regulation. The LENG1 gene is located on chromosome 19 and is part of a gene cluster that includes other leukocyte receptor genes, suggesting a coordinated function in immune system modulation. The protein's structure and interactions with other cellular components are crucial for its function in signaling pathways that influence immune cell behavior. Understanding the role of LENG1 and its encoded protein is important for elucidating mechanisms underlying immune responses and potential implications in immune-related disorders.
