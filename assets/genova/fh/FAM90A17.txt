# FAM90A17

## Overview
FAM90A17 is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 90, member A17. This protein is part of a larger family characterized by shared sequence motifs, although the specific functional role of FAM90A17 remains to be fully elucidated. Proteins in this family are often involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and regulation of gene expression, but FAM90A17's precise biological functions and interactions are still under investigation. The gene is located on chromosome 8, and its expression patterns suggest potential involvement in developmental and physiological pathways. Further research is needed to clarify its role in health and disease, as well as its potential interactions with other cellular proteins (Qiu2020aarFDC).
