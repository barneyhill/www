# UBA6

## Overview
UBA6, or ubiquitin-like modifier activating enzyme 6, is a gene that encodes a dual-specificity E1 enzyme involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). The UBA6 protein is unique in its ability to activate both ubiquitin and the ubiquitin-like protein FAT10, distinguishing it from other E1 enzymes such as UBE1. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in post-translational modification processes, which are crucial for regulating protein degradation, signaling pathways, and maintaining cellular homeostasis. UBA6 operates primarily in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with specific E2 enzymes to facilitate the ubiquitination of target proteins, impacting various cellular processes including cell cycle control, DNA repair, and immune responses. The activity of UBA6 is essential for embryonic development and maintaining protein homeostasis, with its dysfunction linked to several diseases, including cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders (Wang2019UBA6; Liu2017Orthogonal; Groettrup2008Activating).

## Structure
UBA6 is a dual-specificity E1 enzyme that activates both ubiquitin and the ubiquitin-like protein FAT10. The protein shares a conserved multidomain architecture with other E1 enzymes, such as UBA1, NEDD8 E1, and SUMO E1, featuring a pseudo-symmetrically arranged AAD and IAD domains, along with a helical-bundle domain, traditionally referred to as a 4-helix bundle but more accurately described as a 3-helix bundle (3HB) (Truongvan2022Structures). The structure of UBA6 includes an inactive adenylation domain, an active adenylation domain, two catalytic cysteine domains, a 3-helix bundle, and a ubiquitin fold domain (Truongvan2022Structures).

The SCCH domain of UBA6 is involved in significant conformational changes, undergoing a 136° rotation termed domain alternation, which positions the catalytic cysteine into the adenylation active site (Yuan2022Crystal). This domain is connected to the adenylation domains by flexible loops, facilitating the transition from adenylation to thiolation-competent states (Yuan2022Crystal). UBA6 also interacts with inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6), which binds to a highly basic pocket on the SCCH domain, stabilizing the open conformation and inhibiting the transition to the closed conformation necessary for thiolation (Yuan2022Crystal).

The UBA6 protein can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, and it may undergo post-translational modifications like phosphorylation (Groettrup2008Activating).

## Function
UBA6, also known as ubiquitin-like modifier activating enzyme 6, is an E1 enzyme that plays a critical role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) by activating and transferring both ubiquitin and the ubiquitin-like protein FAT10. This dual specificity allows UBA6 to participate in the post-translational modification of proteins, which is essential for regulating various cellular processes such as protein degradation, signaling, and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Wang2019UBA6; Truongvan2022Structures).

UBA6 is unique in its ability to activate both ubiquitin and FAT10, a function not shared by the more abundant UBE1 enzyme. It operates primarily in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with specific E2 enzymes, such as UBE2Z, to facilitate the ubiquitination of target proteins (Wang2019UBA6; Liu2017Orthogonal). UBA6-mediated ubiquitination is involved in the regulation of protein stability and degradation, impacting processes like cell cycle control, DNA repair, and immune responses (Yuan2022Crystal; Groettrup2008Activating).

In healthy human cells, UBA6 is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating protein degradation. Its activity is essential for embryonic development, as evidenced by the embryonic lethality observed in UBA6-null mice (Wang2019UBA6; Liu2017Orthogonal).

## Clinical Significance
UBA6 (ubiquitin-like modifier activating enzyme 6) has significant clinical implications due to its role in various diseases. Alterations in UBA6 expression are linked to cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders. In cancer, UBA6 expression levels correlate with tumor immunogenicity and response to immunotherapy. Low UBA6 expression in tumors is associated with better overall survival and progression-free survival in patients undergoing treatments like anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for predicting immunotherapy outcomes (Zhang2022Inhibition).

In the context of neurodevelopmental disorders, UBA6 mutations and expression changes are implicated in conditions such as Angelman syndrome and autism spectrum disorders. UBA6 deficiency in mice leads to behavioral disorders, social interaction deficits, and learning and memory defects, which are linked to morphological brain defects (Wang2019UBA6; Lee2013Altered). UBA6 is also involved in the regulation of Ube3a, a gene associated with these disorders, through post-transcriptional mechanisms (Lee2013Altered).

In acute cerebral infarction, UBA6 downregulation exacerbates brain injury by inhibiting the Notch signaling pathway, leading to increased neuronal apoptosis and poor prognosis (Chen2020Downregulation).

## Interactions
UBA6 is a dual-specificity E1 enzyme that interacts with both ubiquitin and the ubiquitin-like protein FAT10. It forms complexes with these proteins to facilitate their activation and subsequent transfer to E2 conjugating enzymes. UBA6 interacts with FAT10 through its N-terminal domain and the 3-helix bundle, with specific residues such as E320, E324, and D370 playing crucial roles in FAT10-specific interactions (Truongvan2022Structures). The enzyme also interacts with ubiquitin, with key residues like R72 in ubiquitin being affected by mutations in UBA6, such as D616A and E601Q, which selectively impair ubiquitylation while maintaining FAT10ylation (Truongvan2022Structures).

UBA6's interaction with the E2 enzyme USE1 is crucial for the FAT10ylation process. However, this interaction can be inhibited by LMO2, a transcriptional regulator that competes with USE1 for binding to UBA6, thereby blocking the downstream FAT10ylation pathway (Wu2016LMO2). This regulatory mechanism highlights the role of UBA6 in protein degradation processes.

Additionally, UBA6 interacts with inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6), which binds to a specific site on UBA6, modulating its activity and stability by stabilizing the enzyme's open conformation (Yuan2022Crystal). This interaction suggests a unique regulatory mechanism for UBA6 involving cellular metabolites.
