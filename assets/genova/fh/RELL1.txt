# RELL1

## Overview
The RELL1 gene encodes the RELT like 1 protein, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, which is primarily involved in cellular signaling pathways related to immune responses and inflammation. As a Type I transmembrane protein, RELT like 1 is characterized by its association with the plasma membrane and microtubules, and it is known to interact with other proteins such as SPAK and mTOR, influencing key pathways like MAPK and mTORC1 (Cusick2023The; Feng2020RELL1). These interactions suggest a role in regulating autophagy and inflammatory responses. The protein's expression is widespread across various tissues, with notable levels in the testis and placenta, indicating its broad functional significance (Cusick2023The). RELL1's involvement in modulating immune responses and cellular stress pathways underscores its potential clinical significance, particularly in the context of diseases such as gliomas and gastric cancer, where it may serve as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Jin2020RELL1; Sang2022Exosomal).

## Structure
RELL1 is a Type I transmembrane protein that encodes a 271 amino acid-long protein with a molecular weight of approximately 29.3 kDa. Despite its predicted molecular weight, recombinant RELL1 migrates at a position larger than expected, indicating significant post-translational modifications, which may include glycosylation (Cusick2023The). The protein is predicted to contain disordered sequences in its carboxy-terminal tail, suggesting that this region may adopt multiple conformations depending on post-translational modifications or interactions with other proteins (Cusick2023The; Cusick2020RELT).

RELL1 does not contain the extracellular cysteine-rich domains typical of other tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily members, which are used to bind TNFSF ligands (Cusick2023The). It is associated with the plasma membrane and microtubules, and it can bind with other RELT family members, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Cusick2023The). The protein's interactions and localization suggest a role in cellular signaling and structural organization, although specific details about its primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not provided in the available literature (Cusick2023The; Cusick2020RELT).

## Function
RELL1 (RELT like 1) is a protein that plays a significant role in cellular signaling pathways, particularly in the immune response. It is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily and is involved in modulating inflammatory responses. RELL1 is expressed ubiquitously at the mRNA level, with the highest expression in the testis, placenta, and various organs, indicating its broad functional importance across different tissues (Cusick2023The).

In healthy human cells, RELL1 is primarily active at the plasma membrane, where it participates in signal transduction processes. It interacts with other proteins such as SPAK and mTOR, influencing pathways like MAPK and mTORC1, which are crucial for regulating autophagy and inflammation (Feng2020RELL1). RELL1's interaction with mTOR affects mTOR activity, as evidenced by changes in the phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase, an mTORC1 substrate, suggesting a role in inhibiting autophagy (Feng2020RELL1).

RELL1 also influences the NF-κB and MAPK pathways, enhancing the phosphorylation of signaling molecules involved in inflammatory responses (Feng2020RELL1). This protein's expression is modulated by interferon signaling, which can impact immune responses during infections (Cusick2023The). Overall, RELL1 is integral to immune regulation and cellular signaling, impacting processes such as inflammation and autophagy.

## Clinical Significance
The RELL1 gene has been implicated in various diseases due to its role as an oncogene and its involvement in immune system signaling. In gliomas, particularly glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and lower-grade gliomas (LGG), RELL1 is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis. High RELL1 expression correlates with decreased natural killer (NK) cell activity and is linked to worse outcomes in patients with IDH1-wildtype gliomas and those without 1p/19q codeletion, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in glioma treatment (Jin2020RELL1).

In gastric cancer (GC), circRELL1, a circular RNA derived from the RELL1 gene, is significantly downregulated. This downregulation is associated with poor prognosis, advanced stage, and lymph node metastasis. CircRELL1 acts as a miR-637 sponge, influencing the expression of EPHB3 and autophagy activation, which are crucial in GC progression. Its reduced expression is linked to increased tumor growth and metastasis, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in GC (Sang2022Exosomal).

Additionally, circ-RELL1 is involved in inflammatory responses in endothelial cells, contributing to the pathology of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) by modulating the NF-kB signaling pathway (Huang2020Circular).

## Interactions
RELL1, a member of the RELT family of proteins, engages in various physical interactions with other proteins, influencing several cellular pathways. It interacts with RELT and RELL2, co-localizing at the plasma membrane, which suggests a role in modulating RELT signaling (Cusick2006Identification). RELL1 also binds to the OSR1 kinase, a serine/threonine kinase, which phosphorylates RELL1 and other RELT family members, indicating a role in cellular stress responses (Cusick2006Identification).

RELL1 interacts with mTOR, a key regulator of autophagy, affecting mTOR activity and inhibiting autophagy by increasing the phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase, an mTORC1 substrate (Feng2020RELL1). It also binds to SPAK, which is involved in activating the MAPK pathway, suggesting a role in inflammation (Feng2020RELL1). Additionally, RELL1 has been shown to interact with the transcription factor MDFIC, co-localizing at the plasma membrane, which may influence signaling pathways associated with the RELT family (Cusick2020RELT).

These interactions highlight RELL1's involvement in modulating immune responses, autophagy, and cellular stress pathways, making it a significant player in cellular signaling networks.
