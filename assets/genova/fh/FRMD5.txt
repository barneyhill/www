# FRMD5

## Overview
FRMD5 (FERM domain containing 5) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the FERM domain-containing family, which is involved in linking cytoskeletal structures to the plasma membrane. The protein encoded by FRMD5 plays a crucial role in cellular processes such as cytoskeletal organization, cell signaling, and maintaining cell shape, adhesion, and motility (Zhu2017Identification). It is expressed in various human tissues, including the brain, kidney, thyroid, and testis, indicating its broad biological significance (Gaweł2021Analysis). FRMD5 is implicated in several signaling pathways, including the Wnt signaling pathway and the caveolin-1/LRP6/β-catenin axis, which are important in tumorigenesis and metastasis (Mao2019Cterminal; Zhu2017Identification). Additionally, FRMD5 has been associated with clinical conditions such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions (Brázdová2009Modulation; Guo2017Integrative).

## Function
FRMD5 (FERM domain containing 5) is a protein involved in various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal organization and cell signaling. It contains a FERM domain, which is known for linking cytoskeletal structures to the plasma membrane, playing a crucial role in maintaining cell shape, adhesion, and motility (Zhu2017Identification). FRMD5 is active in several cellular compartments, including the cytoplasm and cell membrane, where it participates in cell cycle regulation and DNA replication (Zhu2017Identification).

In healthy human cells, FRMD5 is expressed in various tissues such as the brain, kidney, thyroid, and testis, indicating its importance in biological processes (Gaweł2021Analysis). Although the specific functions of FRMD5 in healthy cells are not fully detailed, it is suggested to be involved in cell-cell contact and regulation of cell migration, as seen in studies related to lung cancer and glioblastoma (Gaweł2021Analysis). The protein's interaction with p120-catenin and integrin β5 suggests a role in stabilizing E-cadherin and repressing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which are critical for maintaining epithelial integrity and preventing excessive cell motility (Zhu2017Identification).

## Clinical Significance
The FRMD5 gene has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to its role in lipid metabolism and gene regulation. Variants in the FRMD5 gene, such as rs524908, have been associated with alterations in serum lipid profiles, including increased levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and apolipoprotein B (ApoB), which are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) (Guo2017Integrative). These associations have been observed in specific populations, such as the Jing population, highlighting the gene's potential contribution to dyslipidemia and CVD risk (Guo2017Integrative).

In cancer research, the FRMD5 gene has been identified as a target of mutant p53 R273H in U251 glioblastoma cells. This mutation in the TP53 gene can lead to altered expression of FRMD5, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis through the modulation of gene transcription and chromatin organization (Brázdová2009Modulation). The interaction of mutant p53 with FRMD5 may contribute to the oncogenic processes by affecting cellular signaling pathways and gene expression profiles (Brázdová2009Modulation). These findings indicate that FRMD5 may play a significant role in both metabolic and oncogenic pathways, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
FRMD5, a member of the FERM domain-containing protein family, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In colorectal cancer cells, FRMD5 is identified as a novel target of the β-catenin/TCF7L2 complex, suggesting its role in the Wnt signaling pathway (Zhu2017Identification). This interaction is crucial for the regulation of gene expression involved in tumorigenesis (Zhu2017Identification).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), FRMD5 is part of the caveolin-1/LRP6/β-catenin axis, where it acts as a downstream effector. Caveolin-1 stabilizes LRP6, which in turn enhances β-catenin activity, leading to increased FRMD5 expression. This pathway is significant in promoting HCC tumorigenesis and metastasis (Mao2019Cterminal).

FRMD5 also interacts with the integrin beta subunit and ROCK1, regulating cell motility and potentially influencing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in lung cancer cells (Mao2019Cterminal). These interactions highlight FRMD5's role in linking cytoskeletal structures to the plasma membrane and its involvement in various signaling pathways across different cancer types.
