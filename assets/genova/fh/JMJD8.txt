# JMJD8

## Overview
The JMJD8 gene encodes the protein jumonji domain containing 8, which is characterized by the presence of a Jumonji C (JmjC) domain. This protein is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is involved in various cellular processes, including angiogenesis and metabolism, particularly in endothelial cells (Boeckel2016JMJD8; Yeo2017JMJD8). Although the JmjC domain is typically associated with demethylase or hydroxylase activity, JMJD8 may not perform these functions due to a substitution in a conserved residue (Yeo2017JMJD8). Instead, JMJD8 interacts with key metabolic enzymes, such as pyruvate kinase M2, influencing glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration (Boeckel2016JMJD8). Additionally, JMJD8 is implicated in cancer progression, where it interacts with proteins like the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to modulate signaling pathways (Zhang2021JMJD8). Its role in various cancers highlights its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker (Wang2019MiR8735p; Su2019JmjC).

## Structure
JMJD8 is a novel endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein characterized by the presence of a Jumonji C (JmjC) domain. This domain is typically associated with hydroxylase or demethylase activity, although JMJD8 may not function as a hydroxylase or demethylase due to a substitution in a conserved residue (Yeo2017JMJD8). The protein contains an N-terminal signal peptide crucial for its localization to the ER, where it primarily resides in the lumen (Yeo2017JMJD8). JMJD8 is predicted to have a transmembrane domain, but its deletion does not affect ER localization, suggesting the prediction might be inaccurate (Yeo2017JMJD8).

JMJD8 forms monomers, dimers, and oligomers, with dimerization or oligomerization being dependent on its ER localization (Yeo2017JMJD8). The protein is N-glycosylated at three potential sites, specifically at asparagine residues 151, 161, and 230 (Yeo2017JMJD8). Despite its structural features, detailed information on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of JMJD8 is not provided in the available literature (Yeo2017JMJD8).

## Function
The JMJD8 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in angiogenic sprouting and cellular metabolism in endothelial cells (ECs). It is highly expressed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and is involved in the regulation of endothelial marker gene expression during endothelial stem cell differentiation. JMJD8's silencing prevents vascular endothelial growth factor-induced EC differentiation, highlighting its proangiogenic function (Boeckel2016JMJD8). 

JMJD8 interacts with pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), a key enzyme in glycolysis, suggesting that it regulates angiogenesis by controlling metabolic functions in ECs. This interaction occurs between amino acids 63 and 124 of JMJD8. Knockdown of JMJD8 results in decreased glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration rates, while overexpression increases these metabolic activities. JMJD8 also influences the enzymatic activity of PKM2, affecting pyruvate synthesis (Boeckel2016JMJD8).

Unlike many JmjC domain-containing proteins, JMJD8 is localized extranuclear in ECs and interacts with proteins involved in cellular metabolism, such as phosphofructokinase 1. These interactions suggest that JMJD8 may influence metabolic processes beyond endothelial cells (Boeckel2016JMJD8).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the JMJD8 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In colorectal cancer (CRC), JMJD8 is upregulated and acts as an oncogene, promoting cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and cell cycle progression while inhibiting apoptosis. This upregulation is associated with poor survival outcomes in CRC patients. JMJD8 is a direct target of miR-873-5p, a microRNA that suppresses CRC progression by binding to the 3'UTR of JMJD8 mRNA, leading to decreased expression of JMJD8. The downregulation of JMJD8 by miR-873-5p inhibits the NF-κB pathway, affecting the nuclear entry of p65, a component of this pathway (Wang2019MiR8735p).

In prostate cancer and HEK293T cells, downregulation of JMJD8 is associated with decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis, respectively. JMJD8 also plays a role in reducing the invasion of squamous cell carcinoma cells (Wang2022JMJD8). In the context of DNA damage and repair, JMJD8 knockdown in cancer cells leads to enhanced cell proliferation and resistance to treatments like ionizing radiation and etoposide, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for assessing cancer treatment efficacy (Su2019JmjC).

## Interactions
JMJD8, a protein with a JmjC domain, is involved in various protein interactions primarily within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It forms monomers, dimers, and oligomers, with its ER localization being crucial for these interactions (Yeo2017JMJD8). High throughput mass spectrometry has identified 35 significant protein targets interacting with JMJD8, mainly involved in metabolic processes. Notably, JMJD8 interacts with proteins involved in protein folding, such as T-complex protein 1, calnexin, calmegin, and calreticulin, suggesting a role in modulating protein folding (Yeo2017JMJD8).

JMJD8 also interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, maintaining EGFR stability and activating the EGFR/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This interaction is crucial for the malignant progression of NSCLC (Zhang2021JMJD8). Additionally, JMJD8 functions as a lysine demethylase, specifically targeting AKT1, influencing its activity by demethylating trimethylated lysine residues (Wang2022JMJD8). These interactions highlight JMJD8's role in various cellular processes, including protein folding, signaling pathways, and cancer progression.
