# IP6K3

## Overview
Inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 3 (IP6K3) is a gene that encodes the enzyme inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 3, which belongs to the kinase family. This enzyme is involved in the phosphorylation of inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) to produce diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate (IP7), a process integral to various cellular functions, including energy metabolism and signal transduction (Rojas2019Inositol; Crocco2016Contribution). The protein encoded by IP6K3 is particularly significant in the regulation of focal adhesion dynamics, which are crucial for cell motility and stability, and is highly expressed in specific brain regions, such as cerebellar Purkinje cells, where it influences synapse formation and neuronal morphology (Rojas2019Inositol; Fu2015Inositol). Additionally, IP6K3 has been implicated in metabolic regulation, affecting glucose metabolism and lifespan, and is associated with conditions such as late-onset Alzheimer's disease and metabolic disorders (Dato2021IP6K3; Moritoh2016Inositol).

## Function
Inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 3 (IP6K3) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in cellular signaling and energy metabolism by converting inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) to diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate (IP7) (Crocco2016Contribution). This conversion is significant for various cellular processes, including the regulation of focal adhesion dynamics, which are essential for cell motility and stability. IP6K3 interacts with dynein intermediate chain 2 (DIC2) to promote focal adhesion turnover, enhancing the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin, proteins involved in cell adhesion and signaling (Rojas2019Inositol).

IP6K3 is particularly enriched at the leading edge of migrating cells, where it facilitates the recruitment of DIC2 to the cell membrane, crucial for proper cell movement and orientation (Rojas2019Inositol). In the brain, IP6K3 is highly expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells, where it regulates synapse formation and morphology by maintaining interactions between spectrin and adducin, which are vital for the structural integrity of these neurons (Fu2015Inositol). The enzyme's activity is also linked to metabolic regulation, influencing glucose metabolism and lifespan in muscle tissues (Moritoh2016Inositol).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the IP6K3 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. IP6K3 is associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) and longevity. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the IP6K3 gene, such as rs10947435, are linked to increased longevity but also to a higher risk of LOAD, indicating a complex role in neurodegeneration and survival (Dato2021IP6K3). The gene's involvement in metabolic diseases is also significant. In mice, the knockout of IP6K3 leads to protection against age-induced weight gain and insulin resistance, suggesting its role in glucose metabolism and energy regulation. This has implications for conditions like diabetes and obesity (Moritoh2016Inositol; Mukherjee2020Targeting).

In the brain, IP6K3 is highly expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells, where it influences synapse formation and morphology. Deletion of IP6K3 results in reduced synapse numbers and impaired motor coordination, highlighting its importance in maintaining neural structure and function (Fu2015Inositol). These findings suggest that IP6K3 plays a critical role in both metabolic and neurological health, with potential implications for therapeutic targeting in related diseases.

## Interactions
IP6K3 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It specifically binds to dynein intermediate chain 2 (DIC2), a crucial interaction for promoting focal adhesion turnover. This binding enhances the interaction between DIC2 and p150glued, a major subunit of the dynactin complex, which is essential for the regulation of dynein and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activities (Rojas2019Inositol). The interaction between IP6K3 and DIC2 is specific, as DIC2 does not bind to other IP6K family members, such as IP6K1 or IP6K2 (Rojas2019Inositol). This interaction is mediated by a specific region of IP6K3, the 67-to 138-amino acid fragment, and does not require the kinase activity of IP6K3 (Rojas2019Inositol).

IP6K3 also interacts with spectrin and adducin proteins, which are crucial for maintaining the structure and function of cerebellar Purkinje cells. In IP6K3 knock-out models, the interaction between spectrins and adducins is disrupted, leading to morphological changes in Purkinje cells and motor deficits (Fu2015Inositol). These interactions are specific to IP6K3 and are not observed with other IP6 kinase isoforms (Fu2015Inositol).
