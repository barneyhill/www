# LITAFD

## Overview
The LITAFD gene encodes a protein known as LITAF domain containing, which is integral to cellular processes involving endosomal trafficking and membrane dynamics. This protein is characterized by its monotopic membrane association, primarily interacting with endocytic vesicles. Structurally, it features a proline-rich N-terminal region and a C-terminal LITAF domain, which is crucial for zinc coordination and structural stability. Functionally, the LITAF domain containing protein is involved in the sorting and recycling of cellular cargo, such as EGFR and integrins, and plays a role in various signaling pathways, including those mediated by EGFR and TGF-β. It interacts with several proteins, including E3 ubiquitin ligases and components of the ESCRT complex, influencing protein degradation and vesicular trafficking. Clinically, mutations in the LITAF gene are linked to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1C, a demyelinating neuropathy, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and nerve function (Ho2016The; ho2019characterisation).

## Structure
The LITAFD protein, associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1C, is characterized by a distinct molecular structure comprising an N-terminal proline-rich region and a C-terminal LITAF domain. The primary structure includes conserved cysteine residues within the LITAF domain, which are crucial for zinc coordination and structural integrity (Ho2016The). The secondary structure of the LITAF domain consists of five β-strands, with three located at the N-terminus and two forming a β-hairpin at the C-terminus (Ho2016The). These β-strands contribute to a compact domain structure, stabilized by zinc coordination (Ho2016The).

The tertiary structure involves a hydrophobic helical region that anchors the protein to membranes, predominantly associating with endocytic vesicles (Ho2016The). The LITAF domain's interaction with phosphatidylethanolamine head groups suggests a role in membrane dynamics (Ho2016The). The proline-rich N-terminal region is largely unstructured and contains motifs such as PPXY, which interact with proteins like NEDD4, influencing intracellular localization (Ho2016The).

The LITAFD protein is a monotopic membrane protein, with both termini facing the cytosol, and it does not traverse membranes but adopts an in-plane membrane anchor configuration (Ho2016The; ho2019characterisation). The protein's structure is integral to its function in endocytic membrane trafficking and interactions with receptor trafficking proteins (Ho2016The).

## Function
The LITAFD gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in cellular processes, particularly in endosomal trafficking and membrane dynamics. The LITAF protein is associated with the endosomal membrane and is involved in the sorting and recycling of cellular cargo, such as EGFR and integrins, back to the plasma membrane via the Rab11-dependent recycling pathway (ho2019characterisation). It interacts with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) head groups on membranes, and mutations in the LITAF domain can disrupt these interactions, affecting protein stability and function (Ho2016The).

LITAF is also implicated in regulating signaling pathways, including EGFR and ErbB2/3, which activate ERK1/2, and IL-1 and TGF-β pathways, which activate p38, JNK, and NF-κB (ho2019characterisation). The protein's interaction with NEDD4 ubiquitin ligase and other proteins influences its intracellular localization and function, suggesting a role in membrane trafficking and receptor internalization (Ho2016The; ho2019characterisation).

In healthy human cells, LITAF is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis, potentially influencing processes like autophagy and integrin recycling, which are vital for myelin sheath stability and peripheral nerve function (ho2019characterisation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LITAF gene, which contains the LITAF domain, are associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1C (CMT1C), a demyelinating neuropathy. These mutations, such as L125P, T115N, and V144M, lead to dysfunction in the endolysosomal pathway, resulting in enlarged late endosomal and lysosomal compartments in patient fibroblasts (Edgar2020A; Ho2016The). The mutations are located in the hydrophobic region of the LITAF domain and disrupt its interaction with endosomal membranes, causing a loss of function through a dominant-negative mechanism (Edgar2020A; Ho2016The). This disruption affects intracellular membrane trafficking, particularly in Schwann cells, leading to demyelination and secondary axonal degeneration (Ho2016The).

Altered expression levels of LITAF may also be linked to inflammatory conditions and certain cancers, affecting cellular processes like apoptosis and immune response. The mislocalization of LITAF due to mutations can disrupt the recruitment of ESCRT components, affecting lysosomal degradation and contributing to the pathogenesis of CMT1C (ho2019characterisation). Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing therapeutic strategies for CMT1C and related conditions (Edgar2020A).

## Interactions
LITAFD, containing the LITAF domain, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for cellular processes. The N-terminal proline-rich region of LITAFD contains PPXY motifs that interact with the WW domains of E3 ubiquitin ligases such as NEDD4 and Itch. These interactions are important for the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of proteins, influencing protein degradation pathways (Ho2016The; ho2019characterisation). 

LITAFD also interacts with components of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT), such as TSG101 and STAM, which are involved in vesicular trafficking and cellular signaling (ho2019characterisation). The interaction with TSG101 is mediated by the P(S/T)AP motif in the proline-rich region (Ho2016The). 

The protein is suggested to recruit ESCRT components to endosomal membranes, regulating endosomal trafficking of receptors and potentially playing roles in multivesicular bodies (MVBs), exosome formation, and autophagy in B cells (ho2019characterisation). 

Additionally, LITAFD interacts with BAG3, with the first PPXY motif being crucial for this interaction, although the interaction might be transient or condition-specific (ho2019characterisation). These interactions highlight the role of LITAFD in endocytic trafficking and sorting of cargo in endosomal compartments.
