# SLC35A5

## Overview
SLC35A5 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 35 member A5, which is part of the SLC35A subfamily of solute carriers. This protein is primarily localized to the Golgi apparatus and is involved in the transport of nucleotide sugars, which are essential for glycosylation processes within the cell. The SLC35A5 protein is characterized by its highly acidic C-terminus and the presence of specific motifs that facilitate the binding of nucleotide sugar substrates and coordination of divalent cations. It forms homomers and heteromers with other SLC35A subfamily members, suggesting its role in a multiprotein complex that regulates nucleotide sugar transport. Despite its involvement in these critical cellular processes, the inactivation of SLC35A5 does not significantly impact glycosylation, indicating potential compensatory mechanisms. The gene has also been implicated in autoimmune conditions, such as lupus, although its precise role in disease pathogenesis remains to be fully elucidated (AlFadhli2015Genomewide; Sosicka2019SLC35A5).

## Structure
The SLC35A5 protein is a member of the solute carrier family 35, specifically the SLC35A subfamily, and is characterized by its localization to the Golgi apparatus. The protein has a highly acidic C-terminus, which is exposed to the cytosol and contains several functional motifs, including DXEE, DXXD, and DXD. These motifs are known for their roles in binding nucleotide sugar substrates and coordinating divalent cations, which are crucial for the protein's function in nucleotide sugar transport (Sosicka2019SLC35A5).

The SLC35A5 protein forms homomers and heteromers with other members of the SLC35A subfamily, suggesting it may be part of a multiprotein complex involved in nucleotide sugar transport (Sosicka2019SLC35A5). The protein's C-terminus is notably long, over 80 amino acids, which may have implications for its function and interaction with other proteins (Sosicka2019SLC35A5).

There is evidence that SLC35A5 might undergo N-terminal proteolytic processing, which is unusual for proteins in the SLC35 family (Sosicka2019SLC35A5). However, specific details about the primary, secondary, and tertiary structures of SLC35A5 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The SLC35A5 protein is a member of the solute carrier family 35 (SLC35), specifically within the SLC35A subfamily, which is known for its role in nucleotide sugar transport. SLC35A5 is localized exclusively to the Golgi apparatus, where it is hypothesized to be involved in the transport of nucleotide sugars, such as UDP-glucuronic acid, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, and UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine, into the Golgi complex (Sosicka2019SLC35A5). This transport is crucial for glycosylation processes, which are essential for proper protein and lipid modification in cells (Sosicka2019SLC35A5).

The protein's C-terminus is acidic and contains motifs like DXEE, DXD, and DXXD, which are directed toward the cytosol and are known for their roles in binding nucleotide sugar substrates (Sosicka2019SLC35A5). SLC35A5 can form homomers and interact with other SLC35A subfamily members, suggesting it may be part of a multiprotein complex involved in nucleotide sugar transport (Sosicka2019SLC35A5). Despite its role in nucleotide sugar transport, inactivation of the SLC35A5 gene in HepG2 cells did not significantly affect N- or O-glycan synthesis, indicating potential compensatory mechanisms within the cell (Sosicka2019SLC35A5).

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the SLC35A5 gene, which encodes a protein involved in nucleotide sugar transport, is not fully understood. However, research has indicated its potential involvement in autoimmune conditions. A study on Arab female lupus and lupus nephritis cases identified SLC35A5 as differentially spliced in lupus patients compared to healthy controls, suggesting a possible role in the disease's progression (AlFadhli2015Genomewide). Despite this, the specific function of SLC35A5 in autoimmunity remains to be further explored.

In contrast, studies focusing on the SLC35A5 gene's role in glycosylation have not directly linked it to specific diseases. Research using HepG2 cells demonstrated that inactivation of SLC35A5 did not significantly alter glycosylation profiles, although it did affect the uptake of certain nucleotide sugars into the Golgi apparatus (Sosicka2019SLC35A5). This suggests that while SLC35A5 may be part of a Golgi-resident multiprotein complex, its function might be compensated by other transporters, and no direct disease associations have been established (Sosicka2019SLC35A5). Further research is needed to clarify the clinical implications of SLC35A5 expression and function.

## Interactions
The SLC35A5 protein, a member of the SLC35A subfamily, is involved in interactions with other proteins within the same subfamily. Using the FLIM/FRET approach in HEK293T cells, it was demonstrated that SLC35A5 forms homomers and interacts with all other members of the SLC35A subfamily, including SLC35A1, SLC35A2, SLC35A3, and SLC35A4 (Sosicka2019SLC35A5). These interactions suggest that SLC35A5 may be part of a multiprotein complex involved in nucleotide sugar transport within the Golgi apparatus (Sosicka2019SLC35A5).

The study also highlighted a functional interaction between SLC35A5 and SLC35A2-ER, where overexpression of these proteins resulted in a significant pool of the UDP-Gal transporter in the Golgi apparatus (Sosicka2019SLC35A5). This indicates a potential regulatory role for SLC35A5 in the transport of nucleotide sugars, possibly by influencing the activity of other transporters through heterologous interactions (Sosicka2019SLC35A5). The presence of several diacidic motifs in the C-terminus of SLC35A5, which are known for binding nucleotide sugar substrates, supports its involvement in these interactions (Sosicka2019SLC35A5).
