# EIF2B2

## Overview
The EIF2B2 gene encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B subunit beta, a critical component of the eIF2B complex, which functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) in the initiation of protein synthesis. This protein is integral to the regulation of translation initiation by facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP on eIF2, a process essential for the formation of the ternary complex required for translation initiation (Moon2018EIF2B2; Kenner2019eIF2Bcatalyzed). EIF2B2, as part of the eIF2B complex, plays a pivotal role in the integrated stress response (ISR), modulating protein synthesis in response to cellular stress by interacting with phosphorylated eIF2α (Moon2018EIF2B2). The protein's function is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and adaptation to stress, and its dysfunction is implicated in various pathological conditions, including vanishing white matter disease (VWMD) (Moon2018EIF2B2).

## Function
The EIF2B2 gene encodes a subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) complex, which is a crucial guanine nucleotide exchange factor involved in the initiation of protein synthesis. In healthy human cells, the eIF2B complex facilitates the exchange of GDP for GTP on eIF2, a critical step for the formation of the ternary complex necessary for translation initiation (Moon2018EIF2B2; Moon2018Analysis). This process is essential for maintaining efficient protein synthesis under normal conditions.

EIF2B2, as part of the eIF2B complex, plays a significant role in the integrated stress response (ISR). During cellular stress, eIF2α is phosphorylated, which inhibits the eIF2B complex and leads to a global reduction in translation. This allows for the selective translation of stress-induced genes that are vital for stress adaptation and recovery (Moon2018EIF2B2). The eIF2B complex, including EIF2B2, is also involved in the formation of eIF2B bodies, which are dynamic assemblies that form under stress conditions and are thought to be indicators of translation activity (Moon2018Analysis). These functions highlight the importance of EIF2B2 in regulating protein synthesis and cellular stress responses.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EIF2B2 gene are associated with vanishing white matter disease (VWMD), a rare and fatal leukodystrophy characterized by progressive loss of white matter in the brain. VWMD is triggered by stressors such as physical trauma or febrile illnesses, which activate the integrated stress response (ISR) and lead to hypersuppression of translation in cells with EIF2B2 mutations (Moon2018EIF2B2). These mutations impair the function of the eIF2B complex, crucial for translation initiation, resulting in delayed recovery from stress and contributing to white matter loss (Moon2018EIF2B2).

VWMD is an autosomal recessive disorder, and cases have been reported where a combination of a submicroscopic deletion and a missense mutation in EIF2B2 led to the disease (Shimada2012An). The clinical presentation of VWMD can vary, with symptoms including psychomotor deterioration, epilepsy, and leukoencephalopathy (Filareto2022EIF2B2; Shimada2012An). The disease is also linked to other conditions, such as cataracts, due to elevated levels of phosphorylated eIF2α (Moon2018EIF2B2). There is no effective therapy for VWMD, although small molecules targeting the ISR pathway show potential in ameliorating translation defects in patient cells (Moon2018EIF2B2).

## Interactions
EIF2B2, a subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) complex, participates in several critical interactions within the cell. It is part of the heterodecameric eIF2B complex, which includes two copies each of five subunits (α, β, γ, δ, ε) and functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for eIF2. This complex facilitates the exchange of GDP for GTP on eIF2, a crucial step in the initiation of protein synthesis (Kenner2019eIF2Bcatalyzed).

EIF2B2 interacts with other eIF2B subunits to form a stable complex. The assembly of eIF2B into tetramers, octamers, and decamers is influenced by ISRIB, a small-molecule inhibitor that enhances the stability of the eIF2B complex (Schoof2021eIF2B). ISRIB binds to the eIF2B complex at a site involving the β and δ subunits, stabilizing the complex and promoting its dimerization (Zyryanova2017Binding; Sidrauski2015Pharmacological).

The eIF2B complex, including EIF2B2, also interacts with phosphorylated eIF2α (eIF2α-P), which inhibits its GEF activity. ISRIB can counteract this inhibition by promoting the assembly of eIF2B into active forms, thereby enhancing its function even in the presence of eIF2α-P (Schoof2021eIF2B).
