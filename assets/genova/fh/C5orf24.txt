# C5orf24

## Overview
C5orf24 is a gene located on chromosome 5 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 5 open reading frame 24. This protein is currently uncharacterized, but emerging research suggests it may play a significant role in various biological processes, particularly in cancer and neurological disorders. The protein encoded by C5orf24 is involved in multiple protein-protein interactions, including those with oncoproteins such as XPO1, PBX1, and MYC, indicating its potential involvement in cancer-related pathways (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Additionally, genetic studies have linked C5orf24 to early-onset Parkinson's disease, highlighting its possible role in neurological conditions (Fan2021Analysis). Despite its associations with disease, the precise biological functions and mechanisms of action of the C5orf24 protein remain to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
C5orf24 has been implicated in several diseases, primarily through its association with cancer and neurological disorders. In cancer research, C5orf24 is linked with various oncoproteins and cancer hallmarks, suggesting its involvement in cancer-related pathways. It interacts with proteins such as XPO1, PBX1, MYC, CIC, GOPC, CREB1, and STK11, which are associated with cancer progression (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). The gene is also noted for its potential role in leukemia, as indicated by over-representation analysis showing related Gene Ontology terms (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Additionally, C5orf24 is involved in protein-protein interactions that are significant in cancer biology, particularly in thymoma through its interaction with PBX1 (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

In neurological disorders, C5orf24 has been associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), particularly early-onset PD in the Chinese Han population. A specific variant, rs11950533, in the C5orf24 gene has been linked to early-onset PD, suggesting a genetic predisposition (Fan2021Analysis). The gene's DNA methylation levels have also been associated with negative affect scores in drug addicts and altered expression in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Fan2021Analysis). These findings indicate that C5orf24 may play a role in the pathophysiology of PD and other neurological conditions.

## Interactions
C5orf24 is involved in various protein-protein interactions that suggest its role in cancer-related pathways. It has been identified to interact with C16orf71, supported by the presence of common protein partners (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). The subinteractome of C5orf24 includes interactions with several oncoproteins such as XPO1, PBX1, MYC, CIC, GOPC, CREB1, and STK11, indicating its potential involvement in cancer hallmark processes (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Specifically, C5orf24 interacts with PBX1 and WDR45B in thymoma, as well as with GOPC, which are part of cancer-dependent protein-protein interactions characterized by positive gene co-expression in cancers (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

These interactions suggest that C5orf24 may play a role in signaling pathways and regulatory networks critical for cancer development. The over-representation analysis of C5orf24's interactions indicates related Gene Ontology (GO) terms such as 'PA444750~leukemia' and 'PA444761~leukemia, myeloid', further supporting its involvement in cancer processes (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). However, there is no specific mention of C5orf24 interacting with nucleic acids in the available data (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).
