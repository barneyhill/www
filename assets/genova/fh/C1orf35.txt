# C1orf35

## Overview
C1orf35, or chromosome 1 open reading frame 35, is a gene located on chromosome 1q42.13 that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of gene transcription. The protein, also referred to as Multiple Myeloma Tumor-Associated Protein 2, is characterized by its role as a signaling molecule within the nucleus, with potential phosphorylation and N-myristoylation sites, as well as nuclear localization signals (Luo2020C1orf35). C1orf35 is notably implicated in the activation of c-MYC transcription, a process critical for cell cycle regulation and proliferation, by binding to the Nuclease hypersensitivity element III 1 (NHE III 1) within the c-MYC promoter (Luo2020C1orf35). This interaction is significant in the context of multiple myeloma and other cancers, where deregulated c-MYC transcription is a hallmark (Luo2020C1orf35). Additionally, C1orf35 has been associated with preeclampsia and oral squamous cell carcinoma, highlighting its broader clinical significance (Melton2019Wholeexome; Khowal2021Molecular).

## Function
C1orf35, also known as chromosome 1 open reading frame 35, is a gene located on chromosome 1q42.13 that encodes a polypeptide of 263 amino acids. This protein is implicated in several molecular processes, particularly in the regulation of gene transcription. Bioinformatic analysis suggests that C1orf35 contains multiple phosphorylation sites for protein kinases, N-myristoylation sites, and nuclear localization signals, indicating its potential role as a signaling molecule within the nucleus (Luo2020C1orf35).

C1orf35 is involved in the activation of c-MYC transcription, a critical process in cell cycle regulation and proliferation. It specifically binds to the Nuclease hypersensitivity element III 1 (NHE III 1) within the c-MYC promoter, a region responsible for controlling approximately 90% of c-MYC transcription. This binding occurs under the single-strand i-motif conformation, which is crucial for the transcriptional activation of c-MYC (Luo2020C1orf35). The activation of c-MYC by C1orf35 influences cell cycle progression and cell proliferation, contributing to neoplastic processes (Luo2020C1orf35).

While the study primarily focuses on the role of C1orf35 in multiple myeloma, its involvement in c-MYC regulation suggests that it may also play a role in other cancers and diseases characterized by deregulated c-MYC transcription (Luo2020C1orf35). The specific function of C1orf35 in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated, but its ability to modulate c-MYC expression suggests a potential role in regulating cell growth and proliferation in normal cellular contexts (Luo2020C1orf35).

## Clinical Significance
The C1orf35 gene has been implicated in multiple myeloma (MM), a type of hematological malignancy. Research indicates that C1orf35 acts as an oncogene by promoting cell cycle progression and enhancing cell proliferation through the upregulation of the c-MYC oncogene. Overexpression of C1orf35 in MM cell lines leads to increased c-MYC expression and cell proliferation, while knockdown of C1orf35 results in reduced c-MYC levels and proliferation. This suggests that C1orf35 contributes to tumorigenesis in MM by activating c-MYC transcription (Luo2020C1orf35).

In addition to its role in MM, C1orf35 has been associated with preeclampsia, a pregnancy-related disorder. A study identified a moderately rare variant, rs145743393, in the C1orf35 gene that showed significant association with preeclampsia in certain families. This variant was observed to segregate with the disease in familial cases, suggesting a potential genetic link to preeclampsia, although broader population studies did not find significant associations (Melton2019Wholeexome).

C1orf35 is also noted to be upregulated in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), where it is associated with cell transformation and proliferation, further indicating its role in cancer biology (Khowal2021Molecular).

## Interactions
C1orf35, also known as Multiple Myeloma Tumor-Associated Protein 2, is involved in several interactions with nucleic acids and proteins that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. One of the primary interactions of C1orf35 is with the c-MYC oncogene. C1orf35 activates c-MYC transcription by binding to the i-motif of the NHE III 1 region in the c-MYC promoter, which is responsible for controlling a significant portion of c-MYC transcription. This interaction is essential for promoting cell cycle progression and proliferation in multiple myeloma (Luo2020C1orf35).

The binding of C1orf35 to the c-MYC promoter occurs under the single-strand i-motif conformation, and this interaction is not inhibited by a mutant probe, indicating a specific and stable interaction (Luo2020C1orf35). This interaction suggests that C1orf35 may play a broader role in the pathogenesis of cancers characterized by deregulated c-MYC transcription (Luo2020C1orf35).

Additionally, C1orf35 has been implicated in modifying the tumor microenvironment, potentially contributing to tumor progression and metastasis by influencing the expression of c-MYC and other genes (Khowal2021Molecular).
