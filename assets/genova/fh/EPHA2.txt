# EPHA2

## Overview
EPHA2 is a gene that encodes the EPH receptor A2, a member of the Eph receptor tyrosine kinase family, which plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes. The EPH receptor A2 is a transmembrane protein involved in cell signaling pathways that regulate cell shape, movement, and attachment. It is characterized by a complex structure that includes an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane segment, and an intracellular kinase domain, which is crucial for its signaling functions (Lechtenberg2021Regulation; Wei2014Structures). The receptor is primarily expressed in epithelial cells and is involved in maintaining cell adhesion and regulating cell growth. It interacts with its ligand, ephrinA1, to modulate integrin-mediated adhesion and cell migration (Wykosky2005EphA2). EPHA2 is implicated in various physiological processes, including epithelial morphogenesis and angiogenesis, and its dysregulation is associated with several pathological conditions, such as cancer and congenital cataracts (Banerjee2020EPH; Zhai2019A).

## Structure
The EPHA2 protein is a member of the Eph receptor tyrosine kinase family, characterized by a complex molecular structure. Its primary structure includes a signal peptide, an extracellular region with a ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane segment, and an intracellular kinase domain (Lechtenberg2021Regulation). The secondary structure features a bilobed architecture typical of receptor tyrosine kinases, with an N-terminal lobe composed of a five-stranded β-sheet and a single large α-helix, and a larger C-terminal lobe that is mainly α-helical but includes a two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (Wei2014Structures).

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains into a functional receptor, with the kinase domain playing a crucial role in signaling through autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues (Lechtenberg2021Regulation). The quaternary structure may involve dimerization upon ligand binding, which is common among receptor tyrosine kinases (Lechtenberg2021Regulation).

EPHA2 undergoes post-translational modifications, primarily phosphorylation, which is essential for its activation and function. Phosphorylation of the activation segment tyrosine is crucial for kinase activation (Wei2014Structures). The protein also has several splice variant isoforms that can affect its function and localization (Lechtenberg2021Regulation).

## Function
EPHA2 (EPH receptor A2) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a significant role in cell signaling processes, influencing cell shape, movement, and attachment. In healthy human cells, EPHA2 is involved in maintaining cell adhesion and regulating cell growth and movement. It is typically expressed on the surface of proliferating adult epithelial cells and is localized to points of cell-cell contact where it interacts with its ligand, ephrinA1. This interaction negatively regulates integrin-mediated adhesion, cell spreading, and migration, leading to decreased cell-extracellular matrix contacts and suppression of integrin function (Wykosky2005EphA2).

EPHA2 is also involved in epithelial morphogenesis and signaling networks, where it localizes at tight junctions in epithelial cells. This suggests its role in organizing these structures through interactions with proteins like AFDN, contributing to the regulation of cell-cell junctions and polarity complexes (Banerjee2020EPH). Additionally, EPHA2 forward signaling can promote endothelial angiogenic responses by activating Rac1 through Vav family GEFs and enhance epithelial characteristics by inhibiting RhoA through p190RhoGAP, indicating its role in promoting angiogenesis and maintaining epithelial characteristics (Lisabeth2013Eph).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the EPHA2 gene are implicated in various diseases, notably cancers and congenital cataracts. In melanoma, high levels of EphA2 expression correlate with advanced tumor stages and metastasis. Its overexpression is linked to resistance to BRAF inhibitors, such as vemurafenib, and targeting EphA2 can restore drug sensitivity (Wilson2021Oncogenic). In breast cancer, EphA2 overexpression is associated with increased tumorigenesis and metastasis, particularly in HER2-positive and triple-negative subtypes (Wilson2021Oncogenic). In squamous cell carcinoma and malignant pleural mesothelioma, EPHA2 mutations like A859D and T647M enhance cell proliferation and migration, contributing to cancer progression (Tan2019EPHA2).

EPHA2 mutations also play a role in congenital cataracts. The p.G668D mutation in the kinase domain affects receptor stability and function, leading to cataract formation by promoting dysregulated cell migration (Zhai2019A). This mutation results in enhanced proteasome-mediated degradation of the EphA2 protein, reducing its levels and altering its interaction with beta-catenin, a protein involved in lens differentiation (Zhai2019A). These findings underscore the clinical significance of EPHA2 in both oncogenic processes and ocular diseases.

## Interactions
EPHA2, a receptor tyrosine kinase, engages in various protein interactions that influence cell signaling pathways. It interacts with the Akt signaling pathway, where it acts as both a substrate and a negative regulator. In the absence of its ligand ephrin-A1, EPHA2 is phosphorylated by Akt at the S897 site, promoting cell migration and invasion. Ligand binding to EPHA2 leads to dephosphorylation of S897 and inactivation of Akt, inhibiting these processes (Miao2009EphA2).

EPHA2 also interacts with EGFR, forming a complex that is enhanced by the presence of Ephexin1. This interaction is mediated by the kinase domain of EPHA2 and the RR domain of EGFR, and is influenced by the RAS/AKT signaling pathway (Kim2022Interactions).

In cancer cells, EPHA2 forms complexes with claudin4 and VEGFR2, affecting cell adhesion and migration. The interaction with claudin4 leads to its phosphorylation, increasing paracellular permeability, while the interaction with VEGFR2 enhances tumor cell migration and invasiveness (Cecchini2022EphEphrinBased).

EPHA2 is also involved in the suppression of the Akt-mTORC1 pathway through interactions with a serine/threonine phosphatase, potentially involving a PP1-like phosphatase (Yang2011Crosstalk).
