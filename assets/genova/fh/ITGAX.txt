# ITGAX

## Overview
The ITGAX gene encodes the integrin subunit alpha X, a critical component of the integrin family of transmembrane receptors that mediate cell adhesion and signaling. This gene is primarily expressed in immune cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages, where it plays a pivotal role in immune responses. The protein product, integrin subunit alpha X, forms a heterodimer with the beta-2 integrin subunit to create the integrin αXβ2 complex, which is essential for leukocyte adhesion, migration, and phagocytosis. This complex is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of the cytoskeleton and immune cell interactions, thereby facilitating effective immune surveillance and response (Wang2018Integrin; Bradford2011Defining). The ITGAX gene and its protein product are also implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer, where they influence tumor microenvironments and immune cell infiltration (Cui2021Comprehensive; Wu2020Integrated).

## Structure
The ITGAX gene encodes the integrin subunit alpha X, also known as CD11c, which is part of the integrin family of transmembrane receptors involved in cell adhesion and signaling. The primary structure of ITGAX consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure refers to the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is crucial for its biological activity.

In terms of quaternary structure, ITGAX associates with the beta-2 integrin subunit (CD18) to form the integrin αXβ2 complex. This complex plays a significant role in immune responses, particularly in leukocyte adhesion and migration. ITGAX contains specific domains, such as the I-domain, which is essential for ligand binding and interaction with other molecules (Bradford2011Defining).

Common post-translational modifications of ITGAX include glycosylation, which affects the protein's stability and function. Glycosylation is a critical modification that can influence the protein's interaction with ligands and other cellular components, thereby impacting its role in immune cell signaling and adhesion (Bradford2011Defining).

## Function
Integrin alpha X (ITGAX), also known as CD11c, is a protein that plays a significant role in the immune system, particularly in cell adhesion, migration, and phagocytosis. It is primarily expressed on the surface of immune cells such as dendritic cells and macrophages. ITGAX forms a heterodimer with the integrin beta 2 subunit, creating the integrin αXβ2 complex, which is involved in various cellular processes. This integrin complex is crucial for the regulation of the cytoskeleton, influencing cell shape and motility, which are essential for immune surveillance and response (Bradford2011Defining).

ITGAX is involved in the modulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which aids in antigen sampling and cellular adhesion, allowing immune cells to interact effectively with their environment (Bradford2011Defining). The protein's expression is linked to the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which is known to regulate cell survival, growth, and proliferation (Wang2018Integrin). Although much of the research focuses on its role in pathological conditions like cancer, ITGAX's function in healthy cells is primarily associated with maintaining immune homeostasis and facilitating effective immune responses (Wu2020Integrated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ITGAX gene have been implicated in various cancers. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), ITGAX shows significant mutation rates exceeding 8%, and its expression is progressively downregulated in normal, wild-type, and mutant LUAD samples. This downregulation is associated with poor prognosis, suggesting that genomic alterations in ITGAX contribute to its dysregulation in cancer (Cui2021Comprehensive). In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), including LUAD and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), ITGAX is correlated with the presence of immunosuppressive cells in the tumor microenvironment, such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells, regulatory T cells, and macrophages. This correlation indicates a role in facilitating an immunosuppressive environment, which may impact the response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy (Lin2023Taxifolin).

In ovarian cancer, ITGAX is associated with immune cell infiltration, showing significant correlations with various immune cells, which may influence the tumor microenvironment and immune response (Wu2020Integrated). In melanoma, certain haplotypes of ITGAX have been identified as protective against the disease, although no significant impact on survival outcomes has been observed (Lenci2011Integrin). In prostate cancer, higher expression levels of ITGAX are linked to poor disease-free survival, highlighting its potential role in aggressive cancer phenotypes (Williams2014A).

## Interactions
ITGAX, also known as CD11c, is a component of the integrin alpha X beta 2 complex, which plays a significant role in immune cell interactions. ITGAX forms part of complement receptor 4 (CR4) by integrating with the integrin β2 chain. This receptor is expressed on most white blood cells and is involved in the adherence of neutrophils and monocytes to endothelial cells, as well as the phagocytosis of complement-coated particles (Shi2019Association). CR4 has binding sites for inactive complement component 3b (iC3b) and fibrinogen, facilitating the glomerular infiltration of immune cells (Shi2019Association).

In the context of light chain amyloidosis, ITGAX is involved in hematopoietic cell lineage and immune response, interacting with proteins such as iC3b, ICAM1, ICAM4, and LFA1. These interactions are crucial for the formation of the immunological synapse and the uptake of opsonized cells by immune cells (p&gt; Identification; Bai2020&lt). ITGAX is also associated with immune infiltration and macrophage-mediated inflammation, suggesting its role in the co-pathogenesis of intracranial aneurysms and periodontitis (Chen2024Bioinformatics). These interactions highlight ITGAX's involvement in immune response regulation and its potential impact on various diseases.
