# SEPTIN12

## Overview
SEPTIN12 is a gene that encodes the protein septin 12, a member of the septin family of GTP-binding proteins. These proteins are known for their role in cytoskeletal organization and are characterized by a conserved GTPase domain. Septin 12 is particularly significant in the context of spermatogenesis, where it contributes to the structural integrity and function of sperm cells. It is involved in forming filamentous structures essential for the development of the sperm tail and head, playing a critical role in male fertility (Shen2017SEPT12; Kuo2019Identification). Mutations in the SEPTIN12 gene can lead to various spermatogenic defects, underscoring its importance in reproductive biology (Kuo2012SEPT12mutations). The protein's interactions with other septins and proteins such as SPAG4 and LAMINB1 are crucial for maintaining the integrity of the nuclear envelope and proper sperm morphology (Yeh2015SEPT12SPAG4LAMINB1).

## Structure
SEPTIN12 is a member of the septin family of GTP-binding proteins, characterized by a conserved GTPase domain. The primary structure of SEPTIN12 includes six conserved motifs within the GTPase domain, crucial for its function (Kuo2012SEPT12mutations). The secondary structure comprises major α-helices and β-sheets, which are well superimposed in both wild-type and mutant forms, although mutations can alter specific motifs (Kuo2012SEPT12mutations).

The tertiary structure of SEPTIN12 involves the folding of these elements into a three-dimensional shape, allowing it to interact with nucleotides like GDP and GTP analogues. The guanine nucleotide-binding site is well conserved, involving coordination with a Mg2+ ion and several amino acids, such as Gly59, Leu60, Lys62, Ser63, and His170 (Castro2020A). 

In terms of quaternary structure, SEPTIN12 forms filamentous complexes using NC and G interfaces, with unique features compared to other septins. The filaments exhibit alternating NC and G interfaces, with one NC interface in a classical 'open' conformation and the other in a shifted closed conformation (Castro2020A). SEPTIN12 is also part of the septin ring/annulus structure in sperm tails, organizing into SEPT12-7-6-2 and SEPT12-7-6-4 filaments (Shen2017SEPT12).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation at Ser198, play a significant role in regulating SEPTIN12's function. This phosphorylation disrupts the association between SEPT12 and other septins, leading to the disassembly of SEPT12 filaments and affecting sperm motility and male fertility (Shen2017SEPT12).

## Function
SEPTIN12 is a crucial component in the process of spermatogenesis, where it plays a significant role in the development and structural integrity of sperm cells. It is highly expressed in testicular tissue, particularly in post-meiotic germ cells, and is involved in forming a filamentous structure around the acrosome during spermatogenesis (Kuo2019Identification). SEPTIN12 is essential for the polymerization of septin subunits into filaments, which are necessary for the establishment of the septin ring or annulus, a structure critical for normal sperm function and male fertility (Shen2017SEPT12).

The protein interacts with other septins, such as SEPT1, SEPT4, SEPT6, and SEPT7, to construct the SEPT ring structure, which is vital for cortical organization and terminal differentiation of spermatozoa (Kuo2019Identification). SEPTIN12 also forms complexes with SPAG4 and LAMINB1, which are crucial for maintaining the integrity of the nuclear envelope in postmeiotic male germ cells, indicating its role in sperm head formation (Yeh2015SEPT12SPAG4LAMINB1).

Mutations in SEPTIN12 can lead to severe spermatogenic defects, such as immotile, bent tail, and round-headed sperm, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal sperm structure and motility (Kuo2019Identification). The protein's activity is regulated by phosphorylation, which affects its ability to form filaments and maintain the sperm annulus, impacting sperm motility and fertility (Shen2017SEPT12).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SEPTIN12 gene are linked to various forms of male infertility. Two specific missense mutations, Thr89Met (T89M) and Asp197Asn (D197N), have been identified in infertile men. These mutations are located in the GTPase domain of the SEPTIN12 protein and affect its function by disrupting GTP binding and hydrolysis, which are crucial for septin filament assembly. The T89M mutation is associated with asthenoteratozoospermia, while the D197N mutation is linked to oligoasthenozoospermia, both conditions characterized by defective sperm morphology and motility (Kuo2012SEPT12mutations).

Alterations in SEPTIN12 expression or interactions can also lead to male infertility. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) c.474G>A in the SEPTIN12 gene is associated with teratozoospermia and immotile short tail sperm defect, conditions marked by abnormal sperm morphology and motility (Rafaee2019Single‐nucleotide). Phosphorylation of SEPTIN12 at Ser198 disrupts its ability to form filaments, leading to the loss of the sperm annulus and resulting in poor sperm motility (Shen2017SEPT12). SEPTIN12 also interacts with proteins like SPAG4 and LAMINB1, and mutations affecting these interactions can impair nuclear envelope integrity, contributing to conditions such as teratozoospermia and oligozoospermia (Yeh2015SEPT12SPAG4LAMINB1).

## Interactions
SEPTIN12 interacts with several proteins that are crucial for spermiogenesis and the structural integrity of sperm cells. It forms complexes with SPAG4 and LAMINB1, which are essential for maintaining the integrity of the nuclear envelope in postmeiotic male germ cells. These interactions are critical for proper sperm head formation and tail elongation, as disruptions in these complexes can lead to abnormal sperm morphology and DNA damage (Yeh2015SEPT12SPAG4LAMINB1).

SEPTIN12 also interacts with NDC1, a nuclear pore protein involved in nuclear morphology maintenance. This interaction is significant for sperm head and tail formation during spermiogenesis. In SEPT12-mutated sperm, the localization of NDC1 is disrupted, indicating the importance of the SEPT12-NDC1 complex in maintaining proper sperm structure (Lai2016SEPT12–NDC1).

Additionally, SEPTIN12 is involved in the formation of the sperm annulus, a septin-based structure, by forming part of the core complex with other septins like SEPT1, SEPT4, SEPT6, and SEPT7. This complex is crucial for sperm motility and structural integrity, as mutations in SEPT12 can lead to infertility due to defects in the sperm flagellum (Lin2018Regulation).
