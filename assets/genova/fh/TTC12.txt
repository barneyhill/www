# TTC12

## Overview
TTC12 is a gene that encodes the protein tetratricopeptide repeat domain 12, which is involved in the assembly and transport of dynein arms in cilia and flagella. This protein functions as a co-chaperone, facilitating the proper expression and localization of dynein heavy chains, particularly in monomeric inner dynein arms (IDAs) (Thomas2020TTC12). Located primarily in the cytoplasm, TTC12 is crucial for the pre-assembly of dynein arm components before their integration into the axoneme, a core structure of cilia and flagella (Thomas2020TTC12). The protein plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of sperm flagella and is essential for normal sperm motility and morphology (Meng2023Novel). Mutations in TTC12 are linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia and male infertility, highlighting its clinical significance (Thomas2020TTC12; Meng2023Novel).

## Structure


## Function
The TTC12 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the assembly and transport of dynein arms in cilia and flagella, which are essential for their motility. In healthy human cells, TTC12 functions as a co-chaperone involved in the proper expression and localization of dynein heavy chains, particularly in monomeric inner dynein arms (IDAs) in cilia and flagella (Thomas2020TTC12). The protein is primarily located in the cytoplasm, where it participates in the pre-assembly of dynein arm components before their integration into the axoneme (Thomas2020TTC12).

TTC12 is essential for the structural integrity and function of sperm flagella, with a strong concentration in the mid-piece, which is crucial for normal sperm motility and morphology (Meng2023Novel). It is involved in maintaining the proper structure of the axoneme, a core component of the flagellum, by ensuring the correct formation of dynein arms and the mitochondrial sheath (Meng2023Novel).

In airway epithelial cells, TTC12 is vital for the assembly of single-headed IDAs, which are important for ciliary motility. Mutations in TTC12 can lead to defects in these structures, resulting in conditions such as primary ciliary dyskinesia (Thomas2020TTC12).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TTC12 gene are associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a condition characterized by defects in the structure and function of motile cilia and flagella. These mutations lead to impaired assembly of dynein arms, which are crucial for ciliary and flagellar movement. In individuals with PCD, TTC12 mutations result in the absence of inner dynein arms (IDAs) in respiratory cilia and both outer dynein arms (ODAs) and IDAs in sperm flagella, contributing to respiratory issues and male infertility (Thomas2020TTC12).

In addition to PCD, novel homozygous variants in TTC12 have been linked to male infertility characterized by asthenoteratozoospermia. This condition is marked by defects in the dynein arm complex and mitochondrial sheath of sperm flagella, leading to immotile sperm and various flagellar malformations. These variants result in impaired protein function and reduced expression, causing flagellar abnormalities and contributing to infertility (Meng2023Novel).

Alterations in TTC12 expression or mutations may also impact neurotransmitter pathways, potentially contributing to psychiatric disorders such as addiction and schizophrenia, although these associations are less well characterized in the context provided.
