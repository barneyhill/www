# KRTAP5-7

## Overview
KRTAP5-7 is a gene that encodes the keratin associated protein 5-7, which is part of the keratin-associated protein (KAP) family. These proteins are integral components of the hair and nail structure, contributing to the mechanical properties and resilience of keratin fibers. The KRTAP5-7 gene is involved in the formation of the hair shaft and is expressed in the hair follicle, where it interacts with keratin intermediate filaments to form a robust and flexible matrix. Variations in this gene have been linked to several pathological conditions, including familial germ cell tumors and lung cancer, suggesting its role in cellular processes beyond structural support (Germline; p&gt; Crowgey2020&lt; Abudereheman2024Weighted). Further research is needed to elucidate the full spectrum of its biological functions and clinical implications.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the KRTAP5-7 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of familial germ cell tumors, rare germline variants of KRTAP5-7 were identified in Finnish families, suggesting a potential role in predisposing germ cells to malignant transformation or creating a tumor-promoting microenvironment (Germline; p&gt; Crowgey2020&lt). In lung cancer, KRTAP5-7 was found to be recurrently altered with a mutation frequency of 53%, indicating its involvement in the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Abudereheman2024Weighted). 

Additionally, structural variants involving KRTAP5-7 were observed in the Iberian Roma population, suggesting a potential role in adaptability and disease susceptibility, although the clinical significance of these mutations was not directly addressed (Mavillard2023The). In low-grade ovarian serous carcinoma, KRTAP5-7 was among the genes with detected mutations, though the specific clinical implications remain unclear (Wong2022Integrated). These findings highlight the gene's potential involvement in various cancers and genetic conditions, warranting further investigation into its clinical significance.
