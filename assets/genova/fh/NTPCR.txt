# NTPCR

## Overview
The NTPCR gene encodes the nucleoside-triphosphatase, cancer-related protein, which is a member of the nucleoside-triphosphatase family. This protein is characterized by its ATPase activity, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes, including nucleotide metabolism and energy transfer. NTPCR has been implicated in both cancer biology and cardiac function, suggesting its involvement in diverse physiological and pathological contexts. In cancer, particularly epithelial ovarian cancer, NTPCR is noted for its tumor suppressor functions, influencing cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Shang2021Characterization). Additionally, its interaction with the cardiac sodium-calcium exchanger 1 (NCX1) highlights its potential role in cardiac cellular processes (Lubelwana2017Mapping). The dual involvement of NTPCR in cancer and cardiac function underscores its significance in complex regulatory networks, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions and biomarker discovery (Shang2021Characterization).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The NTPCR gene, also known as nucleoside-triphosphatase cancer-related, has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), NTPCR is significantly upregulated in cancerous tissues compared to para-cancerous tissues. Functional studies have demonstrated that overexpression of NTPCR inhibits cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor in EOC. Conversely, downregulation of NTPCR leads to increased cell proliferation and invasion, indicating its potential involvement in cancer progression (Shang2021Characterization).

The study by Shang et al. also highlights that NTPCR expression changes are associated with significant alterations in several biological pathways, including those related to cell cycle progression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which are critical in cancer development (Shang2021Characterization). While the expression status and physiological role of NTPCR in other cancer types remain largely unknown, it is noted to be overexpressed in some tumors, such as neuroblastoma and liver cholangiocarcinoma, suggesting a broader role in tumorigenesis (Shang2021Characterization). These findings indicate that NTPCR could serve as a potential target for therapeutic interventions and prognostic biomarker discovery in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
The NTPCR gene, encoding the nucleoside-triphosphatase cancer-related protein, is involved in various interactions with other proteins. In the context of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), NTPCR has been shown to interact with several microRNAs and transcription factors, including hsa-miR-124-3p, hsa-miR-146a-5p, EP300, GATA2, and STAT3. These interactions are significant as they play roles in tumorigenesis and cancer progression (Shang2021Characterization).

In cardiac function, NTPCR has been identified as one of the protein partners of the cardiac sodium-calcium exchanger 1 (NCX1). This interaction was discovered through mass spectrometry, highlighting NTPCR's ATPase activity as its molecular function (Lubelwana2017Mapping). The study mapping the NCX1 interactome identified NTPCR among 29 common protein partners using two different methods, suggesting a role in cardiac cellular processes (Lubelwana2017Mapping).

These interactions suggest that NTPCR may participate in complex regulatory networks, influencing both cancer-related pathways and cardiac function through its interactions with other proteins and regulatory molecules.
