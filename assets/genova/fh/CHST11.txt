# CHST11

## Overview
The CHST11 gene encodes the enzyme carbohydrate sulfotransferase 11, also known as chondroitin-4-sulfotransferase 1, which is a critical component in the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). This enzyme is categorized as a sulfotransferase and is primarily involved in the sulfation of chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate, essential processes for the formation and function of proteoglycans. These proteoglycans are vital for maintaining the structural integrity of tissues and facilitating cell signaling and adhesion. The enzyme is localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it catalyzes the transfer of sulfate groups to specific positions on N-acetylgalactosamine residues within chondroitin chains (Chopra2015Inherited; Tasdelen2013PPARγ). CHST11 is expressed in various tissues, including cartilage, and plays a significant role in skeletal development and lipid metabolism (Chopra2015Inherited; Tasdelen2013PPARγ). Mutations in the CHST11 gene have been linked to skeletal disorders and other conditions, highlighting its clinical significance (Shabbir2018Homozygous; Klüppel2012C4ST1CHST11controlled).

## Function
The CHST11 gene encodes chondroitin-4-sulfotransferase 1, an enzyme that plays a critical role in the sulfation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), specifically chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate. This enzyme is localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it catalyzes the transfer of sulfate groups to the 4-O position of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues in chondroitin chains (Chopra2015Inherited; Tasdelen2013PPARγ). The sulfation of chondroitin is essential for the formation and function of proteoglycans, which are key components of the extracellular matrix and are involved in cell signaling, adhesion, and maintaining the structural integrity of tissues (Willis2009Identification; Schmidt2004Deregulation).

CHST11 is expressed in various tissues, including cartilage, where it contributes to normal skeletal development by influencing the physiochemical properties of chondroitin and chondroitin glycoconjugates (Chopra2015Inherited). The enzyme's activity is crucial for proper bone development, as evidenced by the skeletal malformations observed in individuals with CHST11 deletions (Chopra2015Inherited). Additionally, CHST11 is involved in lipid metabolism by regulating lipoprotein lipase activity, which affects lipid accumulation in adipocytes (Tasdelen2013PPARγ).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CHST11 gene are associated with a range of skeletal disorders and other conditions. A biallelic deletion of the CHST11/MIR3922 locus has been linked to a novel autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by skeletal malformations and malignant lymphoproliferative disease. This deletion was identified in a proband and her affected sister, both of whom exhibited digital malformations and developed peripheral T-cell lymphoma, suggesting a potential tumor suppressor role for CHST11 and/or MIR3922 (Chopra2015Inherited).

In another study, a homozygous mutation in CHST11, specifically a 5-amino acid deletion in the catalytic domain, was found in a family with skeletal defects such as scoliosis, dislocated patellae, and brachydactyly. This mutation is predicted to damage the protein's structure and function, leading to the observed phenotypes (Shabbir2018Homozygous).

CHST11 is also implicated in Costello syndrome, where its reduced expression is linked to defects in elastogenesis and increased cell proliferation due to oncogenic HRAS signaling. Forced expression of CHST11 in fibroblasts from Costello syndrome patients restored normal elastic fiber formation and reduced proliferation rates, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Klüppel2012C4ST1CHST11controlled).

## Interactions
CHST11 (carbohydrate sulfotransferase 11) is involved in the sulfation of carbohydrates, a critical step in the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans. This enzyme may interact with other proteins that are part of glycosylation pathways, which are essential for the proper functioning of cellular signaling and maintaining structural integrity. These interactions can be part of multiprotein complexes or involve more transient interactions that either activate or inhibit the function of CHST11. Additionally, CHST11 may have interactions with nucleic acids, potentially playing a role in regulatory processes that influence gene expression and cellular responses. These interactions highlight the enzyme's importance in cellular processes and its potential impact on various biological pathways. However, specific details about the exact proteins or nucleic acids CHST11 interacts with are not provided in the available context.
