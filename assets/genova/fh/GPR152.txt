# GPR152

## Overview
GPR152 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 152, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. GPCRs are integral membrane proteins that play a crucial role in cellular signal transduction by responding to various extracellular stimuli and activating intracellular signaling pathways. The G protein-coupled receptor 152 is involved in various physiological processes, although its specific functions and mechanisms of action remain to be fully elucidated. As a receptor, it is implicated in the modulation of neurotransmission and may have potential roles in neuropsychiatric disorders and other health conditions. Understanding the precise biological functions and interactions of GPR152 could provide insights into its potential as a therapeutic target (Qiu2020aarFDC).
