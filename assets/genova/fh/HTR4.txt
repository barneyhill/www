# HTR4

## Overview
The HTR4 gene encodes the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 4 (5-HT4), a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains. This receptor is involved in a variety of physiological processes, primarily through the activation of the Gs/cAMP/PKA signaling pathway. The 5-HT4 receptor is expressed in multiple tissues, including the central nervous system, heart, gastrointestinal tract, and urinary bladder, where it plays critical roles in modulating neurotransmitter release, cardiac function, gastrointestinal motility, and bladder contraction. The gene is known for its multiple splice variants, which contribute to its diverse functional properties and tissue-specific expression. Clinically, HTR4 is implicated in several disorders, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and gastrointestinal and cognitive impairments, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Barnes2020International; Bockaert20045HT4; Hallegger2010Four).

## Structure
The HTR4 gene encodes the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 4 (5-HT4), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by its seven transmembrane domains (TMDs), typical of GPCRs (Barnes2020International; Bockaert20045HT4). The primary structure of the receptor includes multiple splice variants, which differ mainly in their C-terminal regions. These variants include 5-HT4(a), 5-HT4(b), 5-HT4(c), and others, with some variants exhibiting unique features such as a 14 amino acid insertion in the second extracellular loop (Bockaert20045HT4; Bender2000Structure).

Post-translational modifications of the 5-HT4 receptor include N-glycosylation at sites N7 and N180, palmitoylation at cysteine residues C328, C329, and C386, and phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues. These modifications are crucial for receptor activity, endocytosis, and interaction with other proteins (Barnes2020International; Bockaert20045HT4).

The receptor's secondary and tertiary structures are typical of GPCRs, with seven transmembrane helices forming a hepta-helical domain. However, specific details on the quaternary structure are not provided in the available context (Bockaert20045HT4). The receptor's splice variants contribute to its diverse functional properties and tissue distribution (Bender2000Structure).

## Function
The HTR4 gene encodes the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 4 (5-HT4 receptor), a G protein-coupled receptor involved in various physiological processes. In healthy human cells, the 5-HT4 receptor primarily functions by stimulating adenylyl cyclase, which leads to the activation of the Gs/cAMP/PKA signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial in several tissues, including the heart, where it activates L-type Ca2+ channels in atrial myocytes, contributing to cardiac function (Barnes2020International).

In the central nervous system, 5-HT4 receptors are distributed in regions such as the limbic system, striatum, and hippocampus, where they modulate neurotransmitter release, including acetylcholine and serotonin. This modulation influences cognitive and emotional processes, such as learning, memory, and mood regulation (Barnes2020International).

Peripherally, 5-HT4 receptors are involved in gastrointestinal motility by facilitating acetylcholine release, enhancing peristaltic reflexes, and fluid secretion, which are essential for normal digestive function (Barnes2020International). They also play roles in the adrenal gland, influencing aldosterone production, and in the urinary bladder, enhancing bladder contraction (Barnes2020International). The receptor's activity in these systems underscores its importance in maintaining physiological homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
The HTR4 gene, encoding the serotonin receptor 4, is implicated in several disorders due to its role in serotonin signaling and splicing regulation. Mutations in HTR4 can affect splicing, potentially leading to diseases such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (Hallegger2010Four). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HTR4 have been linked to schizophrenia and mood disorders, with some SNPs affecting splicing branch points, which may predispose individuals to these conditions (Hallegger2010Four). The gene's involvement in alternative splicing results in multiple isoforms, which differ in their expression across tissues and may influence drug response and disease susceptibility (Latorre2019Alternative).

HTR4 is also associated with gastrointestinal disorders, as it is expressed in intestinal tissues and plays a role in gastrointestinal motility (Bender2000Structure). In neurological contexts, alterations in HTR4 expression or function have been linked to cognitive impairments and stress-induced eating disorders, with mouse models suggesting its involvement in these conditions (Hallegger2010Four). The gene's role in serotonin signaling makes it a potential target for therapeutic agents in treating Alzheimer's disease, anxiety, and depression (Latorre2019Alternative).

## Interactions
The human gene HTR4, encoding the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 4 (5-HT4), is involved in various protein-protein interactions that influence its function and signaling pathways. The 5-HT4 receptor interacts with GPRIN2, a G-protein-regulated inducer of neurite outgrowth 2, and GPR37, a receptor associated with Parkinson's disease. These interactions were confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments in mammalian systems, indicating a role in modulating the receptor's signaling capacity, potentially through an allosteric mechanism (Sokolina2017Systematic).

The interaction between GPR37 and the adenosine A2A receptor (ADORA2A) was also validated, suggesting a chaperone-like function of ADORA2A in enhancing the expression of GPR37. This interaction is specific, as no positive interaction was observed between GPR37 and ADORA1, a related adenosine receptor (Sokolina2017Systematic). These interactions highlight the complex network of protein associations involving the 5-HT4 receptor, which may have implications for diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. The study of these interactions provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying GPCR-mediated signal transduction and their potential therapeutic targets (Sokolina2017Systematic).
