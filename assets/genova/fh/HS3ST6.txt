# HS3ST6

## Overview
HS3ST6 is a gene that encodes the enzyme heparan sulfate-glucosamine 3-O-sulfotransferase 6 (3-OST-6), which is a sulfotransferase involved in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate. This enzyme plays a critical role in the 3-O-sulfation of glucosamine residues within heparan sulfate chains, a modification that is essential for various biological processes, including cell signaling and tissue morphogenesis (Thacker2014Heparan). The activity of 3-OST-6 is primarily localized to the Golgi apparatus, where it contributes to the structural diversity of heparan sulfate, influencing the binding and activation of specific proteins (Thacker2014Heparan). The expression of HS3ST6 is predominantly found in the liver and kidney, with implications in developmental processes such as left-right patterning in vertebrates (Thacker2014Heparan). Mutations in HS3ST6 have been associated with hereditary angioedema, highlighting its clinical significance (Bork2021Novel).

## Structure
The HS3ST6 gene encodes the enzyme heparan sulfate-glucosamine 3-O-sulfotransferase 6 (3-OST-6), which is involved in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate. The protein structure of 3-OST-6 includes a sulfotransferase domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity. This domain is characterized by a 5-stranded parallel beta-sheet motif flanked by alpha-helices, similar to its paralogs 3-OST-3A, 3-OST-1, and 3-OST-5, with sequence homologies of 78%, 74%, and 75%, respectively (Bork2021Novel).

A specific mutation, c.430A>T (p.Thr144Ser), affects the protein's structure by reducing polar interactions within the beta-sheet motif, which is essential for the protein's stability and function. This mutation leads to a loss of one polar interaction, potentially impacting the protein's stability and function (Bork2021Novel). The mutation also weakens bonding within an antiparallel beta-sheet motif, affecting the protein's stability and flexibility, and may cause a positional shift in the kinked alpha-helix and disarrangement of the flexible unordered loop carrying the catalytic triad and substrate-binding amino acids (Bork2021Novel).

The structural analysis of 3-OST-6, including the impact of the mutation, was visualized using the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System (Bork2021Novel). However, specific details on the primary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, as well as post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
HS3ST6 is an enzyme involved in the 3-O-sulfation of heparan sulfate, a modification that plays a significant role in various biological processes. This enzyme is primarily active in the Golgi apparatus, where it catalyzes the transfer of sulfate groups to the 3-position of glucosamine residues in heparan sulfate chains, contributing to the structural diversity of heparan sulfate (Thacker2014Heparan). The 3-O-sulfation modification is crucial for the binding and activation of certain proteins, influencing cell signaling pathways and biological functions such as cell division, differentiation, and tissue morphogenesis (Thacker2014Heparan).

In vertebrates, the expression of HS3ST6 is tightly regulated and predominantly occurs in the liver and kidney, with lower levels in the heart, brain, lung, and testis, suggesting a role in these tissues (Thacker2014Heparan). In zebrafish, HS3ST6 is implicated in cilia movement within Kupffer's vesicle, affecting left-right patterning during development, indicating its role in dynein organization (Thacker2014Heparan). Although specific functions in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, HS3ST6, like other 3-O-sulfotransferases, is believed to influence various cellular processes through its modification of heparan sulfate (Thacker2014Heparan).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HS3ST6 gene have been linked to a novel form of hereditary angioedema (HAE), characterized by recurrent episodes of severe swelling. This condition is associated with a missense mutation c.430A>T (p.Thr144Ser) in the HS3ST6 gene, which encodes the enzyme HS-glucosamine 3-O-sulfotransferase 6 (3-OST-6). The mutation affects the protein's stability and function by altering polar interactions within its structure, leading to incomplete heparan sulfate biosynthesis. This disruption may impact cell surface interactions crucial for angioedema formation, suggesting a novel mechanism for disease development (Bork2021Novel).

Clinically, patients with this mutation experience symptoms such as facial and extremity swelling, abdominal attacks with severe pain, and potentially life-threatening laryngeal edema. The condition is exacerbated by factors like estrogen and physical trauma. Despite these symptoms, biochemical parameters related to the kallikrein-kinin system remain within normal ranges, and no thrombotic or hemorrhagic diseases have been reported (Bork2021Novel). The mutation leads to a bradykinin-mediated process, with clinical signs predominantly observed in women (Bork2021Novel).
