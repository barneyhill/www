# NBPF19

## Overview
Neuroblastoma breakpoint family member 19 (NBPF19) is a gene that encodes the NBPF member 19 protein, which is part of the neuroblastoma breakpoint family of proteins. These proteins are characterized by the presence of Olduvai domains, which are implicated in human brain evolution and neurodevelopmental processes (Fiddes2019Paired). The NBPF19 gene is notable for its involvement in neurological and muscular disorders, as well as its potential role in cancer biology. The protein encoded by NBPF19 is not currently categorized into a specific class such as kinases or receptors, but its functions and interactions suggest a complex role in cellular processes. The gene's expression and regulation are influenced by genetic and epigenetic factors, including CGG repeat expansions and DNA methylation, which have been linked to various pathologies (Makabe2019Genomewide; Ishiura2019Noncoding).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NBPF19 gene have been associated with several neurological and muscular conditions. Notably, CGG repeat expansions in the NBPF19 gene are linked to neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) and oculopharyngodistal myopathy. These repeat expansions are located in the 5' UTR of the gene and are regionally hypermethylated, which may influence gene expression and contribute to the pathogenesis of these diseases (Ishiura2019Noncoding).

The NBPF19 gene is also implicated in brain evolution and neurodevelopmental disorders. It is part of a group of NBPF genes that have undergone human-specific expansions, particularly in the number of Olduvai domains they encode. These expansions are associated with variations in brain size and cognitive function, and have been linked to conditions such as autism, schizophrenia, microcephaly, and macrocephaly (Fiddes2019Paired).

Additionally, NBPF19 has been highlighted in studies of early-onset endometrial cancer, where significant differences in DNA methylation levels were observed between cancerous and normal tissues. This suggests a potential novel role for NBPF19 in endometrial carcinogenesis, although further research is needed to clarify its involvement (Makabe2019Genomewide).
