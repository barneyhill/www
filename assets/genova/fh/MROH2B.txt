# MROH2B

## Overview
The MROH2B gene encodes the protein maestro heat-like repeat family member 2B, which is part of a family of proteins characterized by the presence of heat-like repeat motifs. These motifs are typically involved in protein-protein interactions, suggesting that MROH2B may play a role in various cellular processes through its interaction with other proteins. While the specific biological functions of the MROH2B protein remain to be fully elucidated, it has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including multiple system atrophy and inflammatory bowel disease, as well as certain lymphoproliferative disorders and cancers (Shadrin2020Shared; Xie2020Hydroa). Despite these associations, the precise mechanisms by which MROH2B contributes to these diseases are not yet well understood, and further research is needed to clarify its role in human health and disease.

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
The MROH2B gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through mutations and alterations in its expression levels. In the context of multiple system atrophy (MSA) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD), MROH2B was found to be significantly dysregulated in the midbrain of MSA mice. However, its expression was negligible, leading researchers to conclude that it is not a primary candidate for MSA-like neurodegeneration (Shadrin2020Shared; Shadrin2019A).

In a study on Hydroa vacciniforme-like lymphoproliferative disorder (HVLPD), MROH2B was identified as a significantly mutated gene, suggesting a potential role in lymphoproliferative diseases or tumors (Xie2020Hydroa). In bladder cancer, a mutation in MROH2B was classified as a passenger mutation, indicating it may not play a significant role in the oncogenic process (Shi2020Identification).

Additionally, MROH2B was identified with homozygous loss-of-function variants in the Kuwaiti population, although specific diseases or conditions associated with these variants were not detailed (John2018Assessment). In neurofibroma cells, MROH2B was noted for loss of function variants, but the clinical consequences remain unclear (Yu2019NF1).
