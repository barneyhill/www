# LIG3

## Overview
The LIG3 gene encodes DNA ligase III, a critical enzyme involved in DNA repair and replication processes. DNA ligase III is categorized as a ligase, a type of enzyme that facilitates the joining of DNA strands by catalyzing the formation of phosphodiester bonds. This enzyme is essential for maintaining genomic stability, as it participates in base excision repair (BER) and single-strand break repair (SSBR) pathways. DNA ligase III exists in multiple isoforms, including DNA ligase IIIα and IIIβ, which arise from alternative splicing. DNA ligase IIIα is involved in both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA repair, interacting with various proteins such as XRCC1 and DNA polymerase γ, while DNA ligase IIIβ is primarily expressed in male germ cells, suggesting a role in meiotic recombination. Mutations in LIG3 have been linked to mitochondrial DNA depletion syndromes and other mitochondrial dysfunctions, highlighting its clinical significance in both genetic disorders and cancer prognosis (Ellenberger2008Eukaryotic; Bonora2021Biallelic; Sallmyr2020Human).

## Structure
DNA ligase III (LIG3) is a crucial enzyme involved in DNA repair and replication, characterized by a complex molecular structure. The protein contains several key domains, including a DNA-binding domain (DBD), a nucleotidyl transferase (NTase) domain, and an oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OBD) domain, which together form a catalytic core essential for its function (Ellenberger2008Eukaryotic; CotnerGohara2010Human). The DBD features a unique positively charged groove formed by basic residues, which is important for DNA end joining (CotnerGohara2010Human).

LIG3 also includes a zinc finger (ZnF) domain, which enhances its ability to bind DNA nicks and gaps, acting as a nick sensor (Taylor2000The; Ellenberger2008Eukaryotic). This ZnF domain is structurally related to those found in poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and contributes to substrate selection and catalytic efficiency (CotnerGohara2010Human).

The enzyme exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, including DNA ligase IIIα and IIIβ. DNA ligase IIIα contains a C-terminal BRCT domain that interacts with XRCC1, facilitating DNA repair processes, while DNA ligase IIIβ lacks this domain and is primarily expressed in male meiotic cells (Ellenberger2008Eukaryotic; Tomkinson1997Mammalian). The structure of LIG3 allows it to dynamically switch between different DNA-bound states, which is crucial for its function in DNA repair pathways (CotnerGohara2010Human).

## Function
The LIG3 gene encodes DNA ligase III, which plays a critical role in DNA repair processes in healthy human cells. DNA ligase III is involved in base excision repair (BER) and single-strand break repair, where it forms a complex with the DNA repair protein XRCC1. This complex is essential for repairing single-strand breaks and UV-induced lesions in nuclear DNA (Ellenberger2008Eukaryotic; Sallmyr2020Human). In the nucleus, DNA ligase IIIα interacts with various proteins, including DNA polymerase β and hOGG1 DNA glycosylase, contributing to the short-patch BER pathway (Ellenberger2008Eukaryotic).

In mitochondria, DNA ligase IIIα is the sole DNA ligase responsible for all DNA joining events during mitochondrial DNA replication and repair. It interacts with DNA polymerase γ, integrating into mitochondrial DNA metabolism (Ellenberger2008Eukaryotic; Sallmyr2020Human). The mitochondrial form of DNA ligase IIIα is generated by alternative translation initiation, which includes a mitochondrial localization signal for import into the mitochondrial matrix (Sallmyr2020Human).

DNA ligase IIIβ, another isoform produced by alternative splicing, is specific to germ cells and lacks the C-terminal BRCT motif found in DNA ligase IIIα (Ellenberger2008Eukaryotic). This isoform is predominantly expressed in male meiotic germ cells, suggesting a specialized role in meiotic recombination (Tomkinson1997Mammalian).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LIG3 gene are associated with several severe conditions, primarily affecting mitochondrial function. Biallelic variants in LIG3 have been linked to myopathic mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (MDS), characterized by severe myopathy and early fatality due to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion (Invernizzi2021Myopathic). These mutations impair ligase activity, leading to defects in mtDNA maintenance, including reduced repair and replication capacity, which results in significant mtDNA depletion in skeletal muscle and myoblasts (Bonora2021Biallelic).

LIG3 mutations are also implicated in a novel mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy, presenting with symptoms such as chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, neurological abnormalities, and mitochondrial dysfunction. This condition is characterized by fragmented mitochondrial networks, reduced oxygen consumption, and increased reactive oxygen species production (Bonora2021Biallelic). Zebrafish models have demonstrated that LIG3 mutations lead to cerebellar hypoplasia and intestinal pseudo-obstruction, further linking these mutations to neurogastrointestinal symptoms (Bonora2021Biallelic).

In cancer, LIG3 expression levels have been studied as potential prognostic biomarkers. In breast cancer, high LIG3 expression is associated with longer recurrence-free survival in some subgroups, although it correlates with shorter survival in progesterone receptor-negative patients (Sun2021Identification). These findings suggest that LIG3 plays a significant role in both mitochondrial diseases and cancer prognosis.

## Interactions
DNA ligase III (LIG3) is known for its role in DNA repair, particularly through its interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. A key interaction is with the DNA, where LIG3 performs the final step of the base excision repair (BER) process by sealing DNA ends with 3'-hydroxyl and 5'-phosphate groups (FAN2005Protein?protein). LIG3 is also noted for its interaction with the DNA repair protein XR, forming a complex that is crucial for its function in single-strand break repair (SSBR) (FAN2005Protein?protein). This interaction is mediated through the C-terminal BRCA1 C-terminal (BRCT) domains of both proteins, and it is essential for the stabilization and function of LIG3 (Taylor2000The).

In addition to its relationship with XR, LIG3 is associated with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), a protein that detects DNA single-strand breaks. LIG3 shows a preference for poly(ADP-ribose) and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated PARP1, which enhances its end-joining activity (FAN2005Protein?protein). This association suggests that PAR, along with LIG3, plays a role in recruiting the LIG3/XR complex to DNA breaks (FAN2005Protein?protein). The presence of a unique zinc finger (Zn-f) motif in LIG3, similar to that in PAR, facilitates its binding to DNA strand breaks, enhancing its ability to repair DNA (Taylor2000The). This feature is not found in other eukaryotic DNA ligases, indicating a unique role for LIG3 in DNA repair processes (Tomkinson199kinson199).
