# SLC8B1

## Overview
The SLC8B1 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 8 member B1, commonly known as NCLX, which is a mitochondrial sodium/calcium exchanger. This protein is integral to maintaining cellular and mitochondrial calcium homeostasis by facilitating the exchange of sodium or lithium ions for calcium ions within the mitochondria. NCLX is distinct from other sodium/calcium exchangers due to its unique ion transport capabilities and its specific localization to the mitochondria, where it plays a critical role in regulating calcium signaling pathways essential for cellular functions such as energy production and apoptosis (Khananshvili2013The). The expression of NCLX is notably high in tissues such as skeletal and heart muscle, brain, and pancreas b-cells, underscoring its importance in physiological processes across various organ systems (Khananshvili2013The).

## Function
The SLC8B1 gene encodes the NCLX protein, a mitochondrial sodium/calcium exchanger that plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular and mitochondrial calcium homeostasis. This protein is unique in its ability to transport either sodium or lithium ions in exchange for calcium ions, distinguishing it from other sodium/calcium exchangers that primarily operate across the plasma membrane (Khananshvili2013The). NCLX is highly expressed in tissues such as skeletal and heart muscle, brain, pancreas b-cells, and lymphocyte B-cells, but is present in minimal amounts in the liver (Khananshvili2013The).

In healthy human cells, NCLX is involved in critical processes such as cell calcium regulation, oxidative phosphorylation, and synaptic transmission. It contributes to the regulation of calcium levels within mitochondria, which is essential for various cellular functions, including energy production and apoptosis (Khananshvili2013The). The protein's activity is specifically located in the mitochondria, where it facilitates the exchange of sodium or lithium ions for calcium ions, thereby influencing calcium signaling pathways and maintaining calcium balance within the cell (Khananshvili2013The). This function is vital for the proper functioning of cells and the overall physiological health of the organism.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SLC8B1 gene, which encodes the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+/Li+ exchanger NCLX, have been implicated in several diseases. In multiple sclerosis (MS), a rare missense variant (p.Ser94Gly) and a nonsense mutation (p.Tyr564Ter) in SLC8B1 have been identified in patients, with the latter predicted to be damaging due to resulting in a truncated protein. These variants are associated with disruptions in calcium homeostasis, potentially influencing inflammasome aggregation and calcium-dependent signaling pathways, although a direct link to MS onset is not fully established (VilariñoGüell2019Exome).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), decreased expression of NCLX leads to mitochondrial calcium overload, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), and altered mitochondrial respiration. This downregulation is associated with enhanced metastatic potential and chemoresistance, particularly to 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), suggesting a role in cancer progression and metastasis (Pathak2020Dichotomous).

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), impaired NCLX expression is linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, contributing to neuronal pathology. Enhancing NCLX expression in AD models has been shown to reduce cognitive decline and neuronal damage, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Jadiya2019Impaired).

## Interactions
The SLC8B1 gene encodes the mitochondrial sodium/calcium exchanger NCLX, which plays a crucial role in maintaining calcium homeostasis within cells. NCLX is involved in interactions with the Na V 1.5 sodium channel, particularly in cardiac myocytes. This interaction is facilitated by the close proximity of NCLX to Na V 1.5 channels near subsarcolemmal mitochondria, suggesting a functional coupling that allows sodium entry through Na V 1.5 to facilitate calcium extrusion from mitochondria via NCLX (PérezHernández2021Structural).

The activity of NCLX is sensitive to changes in cytoplasmic sodium concentration, which is not uniform in active myocytes. This sensitivity allows NCLX to rapidly respond to sodium signals and extrude calcium from mitochondria, highlighting its role in mitochondrial calcium cycling and its potential interaction with Na V 1.5 channels (PérezHernández2021Structural).

While specific protein-protein interactions involving SLC8B1 are not detailed, the gene's product, NCLX, is implicated in broader calcium signaling pathways and may interact with other proteins involved in these processes, such as LETM1 and Cx43 hemichannels, which are also involved in mitochondrial calcium extrusion (PérezHernández2021Structural).
