# NKAIN2

## Overview
NKAIN2 is a gene that encodes the sodium/potassium transporting ATPase interacting 2 protein, a transmembrane protein primarily expressed in the brain. This protein is part of the NKAIN family and is known for its interaction with the beta subunit of the Na,K-ATPase, an enzyme crucial for maintaining the electrochemical gradients of sodium and potassium ions across the plasma membrane. Such interactions are vital for various cellular processes, including osmoregulation, sodium-coupled transport, and the electrical excitability of nerve and muscle cells (Gorokhova2007A; Zuo2013Rare). NKAIN2's expression in both fetal and adult brains suggests its significant role in neuronal development and function (Romania2013HighResolution). The protein's involvement in modulating Na,K-ATPase activity indicates its potential influence on ion conductance and membrane interactions, contributing to cellular homeostasis (Gorokhova2007A).

## Function
NKAIN2 encodes a transmembrane protein that interacts with the beta subunit of the Na,K-ATPase, a critical enzyme for maintaining the electrochemical gradients of sodium and potassium ions across the plasma membrane. This interaction is essential for various cellular processes, including osmoregulation, sodium-coupled transport of molecules, and the electrical excitability of nerve and muscle cells (Gorokhova2007A; Zuo2013Rare). NKAIN2 is primarily expressed in the brain, where it localizes to neurons, suggesting a significant role in neuronal function (Gorokhova2007A).

The protein is involved in modulating Na,K-ATPase activity, potentially influencing ion conductance and membrane interactions (Gorokhova2007A). NKAIN2's interaction with the Na,K-ATPase may also suggest a role in forming or regulating ion channels or transporters, contributing to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis (Gorokhova2007A). The gene's expression in both fetal and adult brains indicates its involvement in neuronal development and function across different life stages (Romania2013HighResolution). While the specific molecular activities of NKAIN2 in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, its interaction with Na,K-ATPase highlights its importance in maintaining neuronal and muscular function (Zuo2013Rare).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the NKAIN2 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In neuroblastoma, a common childhood cancer, NKAIN2 is considered a predisposing candidate gene. High levels of NKAIN2 expression are associated with aggressive neuroblastoma characterized by MYCN amplification and poor prognosis, while low expression correlates with low-risk neuroblastoma and better clinical outcomes (Romania2013HighResolution). NKAIN2 expression is also higher in the blood of neuroblastoma patients compared to healthy donors, suggesting its role in the disease's pathogenesis (Romania2013HighResolution).

In neurological disorders, NKAIN2 mutations have been linked to severe impairments, including febrile and afebrile seizures, motor skill difficulties, and psychomotor retardation. These symptoms are attributed to the truncation of the NKAIN2 protein, which may affect Na+ conductance or Na,K-ATPase function (Gorokhova2007A).

In pancreatic cancer, NKAIN2 is inversely regulated by miR-181d. Downregulation of miR-181d leads to increased NKAIN2 expression, which may suppress cancer development. However, NKAIN2's role in cancer is complex, as it is also highly expressed in neuroblastoma, indicating a potential oncogenic role (Zhang2017Downregulation).

## Interactions
NKAIN2, a member of the NKAIN protein family, interacts with the β subunit of the Na,K-ATPase, specifically the ATP1B1 subunit. This interaction is significant as Na,K-ATPase is essential for maintaining the electrochemical gradients of sodium and potassium ions across the plasma membrane, which is crucial for various cellular processes, including osmoregulation and electrical excitability of nerve and muscle cells (Gorokhova2007A; Zuo2013Rare). 

The interaction between NKAIN2 and the Na,K-ATPase β subunit was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, demonstrating that NKAIN2 can form complexes with this subunit in cellular environments (Gorokhova2007A). The study also suggests that NKAIN proteins, including NKAIN2, might function as subunits of a channel or transporter linked to the Na,K-ATPase, potentially influencing ion conductance (Gorokhova2007A).

In addition to its role in ion transport, NKAIN2 has been implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including its involvement in neuroblastoma and pancreatic cancer, where its expression and interaction with other molecules may influence disease progression (Zhang2017Downregulation; Romania2013HighResolution).
