# TMCO4

## Overview
TMCO4 is a gene that encodes the protein transmembrane and coiled-coil domains 4, which is characterized by its transmembrane and coiled-coil structural motifs. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including maintaining cellular homeostasis and facilitating intracellular signaling pathways. The transmembrane nature of the protein suggests its role in cellular communication and transport across membranes, while the coiled-coil domains are typically associated with protein-protein interactions, indicating its potential involvement in complex cellular networks. TMCO4 has been implicated in several physiological and pathological contexts, although its precise functions and mechanisms of action remain an active area of research. Understanding the role of TMCO4 and its encoded protein is crucial for elucidating its contributions to cellular function and its potential implications in disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
