# GNG4

## Overview
GNG4 is a gene that encodes the G protein subunit gamma 4, a component of heterotrimeric G proteins involved in signal transduction. The GNG4 protein is categorized as a regulatory subunit within the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathway, playing a critical role in transmitting signals from extracellular stimuli to intracellular effectors. This process is essential for modulating various cellular pathways, including those involved in cell growth, differentiation, and metabolism. The GNG4 protein undergoes a disorder-to-order transition upon binding with the Gβ subunit, forming a coiled-coil structure that is crucial for its function in signal transduction (Fonin2019Multifunctionality). The gene's expression and regulation are implicated in several cancers, where alterations can affect tumor progression and serve as potential biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis (Pal2016Epigenetically; Song2020Molecular).

## Structure
The GNG4 gene encodes the gamma subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins, which are involved in signal transduction. In its unbound form, the GNG4 protein is highly disordered, with a percentage of disordered residues (PDR) of 34.7%. Upon binding to the Gβ subunit, GNG4 undergoes a disorder-to-order transition, forming a highly extended α-helical structure. This structure is characterized by a coiled-coil formation with the N-terminal tail of the Gβ subunit, indicating a significant change in its secondary structure (Fonin2019Multifunctionality).

The primary structure of GNG4 consists of its amino acid sequence, which is organized into four exons. The gene exhibits tissue-specific exclusion of exon 2 and alternative promoter usage, suggesting potential regulatory mechanisms that may lead to different isoforms (Yang2006Genomic). The quaternary structure of GNG4 involves its interaction with Gβ subunits to form a functional G protein dimer, which is essential for its role in signal transduction (Fonin2019Multifunctionality). The protein may also undergo post-translational modifications, such as prenylation, which can affect its membrane localization and function.

## Function
The GNG4 gene encodes the gamma subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins, which are integral to the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathway. In healthy human cells, GNG4 is involved in transducing signals from extracellular stimuli, such as hormones and growth factors, to intracellular effectors. This process is crucial for modulating various cellular pathways, including MAPK, PI3K, and RhoGEF, as well as altering levels of secondary messengers like cAMP and Ca2+ (Pal2016Epigenetically).

GNG4 functions as part of the G-protein trimer complex, where it forms a βγ heterodimer that acts as a regulator of signal transduction from GPCRs to the inside of the cell. This regulation is essential for maintaining cellular responses to external signals, thereby influencing cell growth, differentiation, and metabolism (Pal2016Epigenetically). The protein is active in the cell membrane, where it participates in the modulation of signal cascades, ensuring proper cellular communication and function (Pal2016Epigenetically). The precise modulation of these pathways by GNG4 is vital for normal cellular operations and organismal homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GNG4 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), particularly the mesenchymal subtype, GNG4 is epigenetically silenced through promoter methylation. This silencing leads to the activation of the CXCR4 signaling pathway, which is crucial for GBM cell migration and proliferation. The downregulation of GNG4 correlates with increased malignancy and invasiveness in GBM, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (Pal2016Epigenetically).

In colon cancer, GNG4 expression is significantly higher in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This elevated expression is associated with higher pathological stages and lower survival rates, particularly in left-sided colon cancer (LCC). The differential expression of GNG4 between left- and right-sided colon cancers highlights its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker (Song2020Molecular).

In thymic carcinoma, GNG4 is significantly hypermethylated compared to thymomas and healthy thymic tissue. This hypermethylation is linked to the downregulation of GNG4 expression, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor. The methylation status of GNG4 may serve as a biomarker for distinguishing between thymic carcinoma and thymomas (Kishibuchi2019DNA).

## Interactions
GNG4, a member of the G-protein γ family, forms heterotrimers with the α and β subunits of G proteins, which are crucial for signal transduction from G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (Tanaka2021Gprotein). In its Gβ-bound form, the GNG4 subunit exhibits a highly extended α-helical structure, engaging in coiled-coil formation with the N-terminal tail of the Gβ subunit. This structure is supported by specific interactions with the corresponding helical segments of the Gβ subunit, indicating that the extended α-helical structure is dependent on these interactions (Fonin2019Multifunctionality).

GNG4 is involved in the phosphorylation of Akt and the ERK1/2 axis, similar to other oncogenic pathways mediated by GNB1 and GNG2. It promotes adhesion to collagen I and IV, activating FAK/PI3K and MEK/ERK signaling through integrin α2/β1, suggesting a cooperative role in forming a supportive niche for metastasis (Tanaka2021Gprotein). However, specific physical interactions of GNG4 with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond these signaling pathways are not detailed in the provided context. The intrinsic disorder of GNG4 and its ability to form coiled-coil structures may contribute to its binding promiscuity and multifunctionality in various signaling pathways (Fonin2019Multifunctionality).
