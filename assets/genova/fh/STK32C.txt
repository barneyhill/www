# STK32C

## Overview
STK32C is a gene that encodes the protein serine/threonine kinase 32C, which is a member of the AGC superfamily of serine/threonine kinases. These kinases are integral to cellular signaling processes, primarily through the phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues on target proteins, thereby modulating their activity and function. The STK32C protein is particularly noted for its high expression in the human brain, suggesting a significant role in neural functions and signaling pathways (Sun2018Serinethreonine). While the gene is expressed at low levels in normal bladder epithelial cells, its expression is notably altered in certain pathological conditions, such as bladder cancer and psychiatric disorders, indicating its potential involvement in disease mechanisms (Sorrell2020STK32A; Sun2018Serinethreonine). The evolutionary conservation of STK32C across species underscores its importance in fundamental biological processes (Sun2018Serinethreonine).

## Function
STK32C, or serine/threonine kinase 32C, is a protein-coding gene involved in phosphorylation, a fundamental process in cell signaling that regulates various cellular activities. This kinase is part of the AGC superfamily of serine/threonine kinases, which are known to play roles in metabolism, transcription, cell cycle regulation, movement, apoptosis, and differentiation (Sun2018Serinethreonine). In healthy human cells, STK32C is expressed at low levels in normal bladder epithelial cells but is highly expressed in the human brain, suggesting a significant role in neural functions (Sun2018Serinethreonine).

The protein encoded by STK32C is involved in transferring phosphate groups to serine/threonine residues on target proteins, influencing enzymatic activity and other biological functions. This activity is crucial for maintaining proper cellular communication and function across various cellular compartments (Sun2018Serinethreonine). The gene is highly conserved across many species, indicating its potential importance in fundamental biological processes (Sun2018Serinethreonine). While its specific roles in healthy cells are not fully detailed, its high expression in the brain and involvement in phosphorylation suggest it may be critical for neural signaling and function.

## Clinical Significance
STK32C is implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In bladder cancer, STK32C is overexpressed, correlating with more invasive tumors and poor clinical outcomes, such as high tumor pathologic T stage and reduced relapse-free survival in patients treated with transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) (Sun2018Serinethreonine). Knocking down STK32C expression in bladder cancer cell lines significantly inhibits cell proliferation, promotes apoptosis, and reduces colony formation, migration, and invasion, suggesting its critical role in tumor progression (Sun2018Serinethreonine). In vivo experiments further demonstrate that reducing STK32C expression leads to decreased tumor growth and survivability, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Sun2018Serinethreonine).

STK32C is also associated with psychiatric disorders in Down Syndrome patients and adolescent depression (Sorrell2020STK32A). In the context of COVID-19, STK32C is identified as a candidate gene potentially involved in the disease, with its expression being higher in females and stimulated in the blood of COVID-19 patients. This differential expression may contribute to sex-biased symptoms and long COVID (Luo2022Genomewide). These findings underscore the gene's involvement in various pathological conditions, making it a subject of interest for further research and potential therapeutic interventions.
