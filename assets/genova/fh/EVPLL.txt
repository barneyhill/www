# EVPLL

## Overview
The EVPLL gene encodes the envoplakin-like protein, a member of the plakin family, which is integral to cellular structural integrity. This protein functions primarily as a cytoskeletal linker, anchoring cytoskeletal elements to the cell membrane, thereby contributing to cell shape and stability. Envoplakin-like proteins are predominantly active in the cytoplasm and are crucial for maintaining the mechanical stability of cells, particularly in epithelial tissues that experience constant mechanical stress. These proteins play a significant role in ensuring tissue resilience and proper cellular function, which is essential for the barrier function and protection against physical and chemical insults (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Function
The EVPLL gene encodes a protein that is integral to maintaining cellular structural integrity. This protein is part of the plakin family, which is known for its role in linking cytoskeletal elements to cell membranes. In healthy human cells, the EVPLL protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to maintaining cell shape and stability. By anchoring cytoskeletal components to the cell membrane, it plays a crucial role in ensuring tissue resilience and proper cellular function. The structural support provided by the EVPLL protein is essential for the mechanical stability of cells, which is vital for the normal functioning of tissues that undergo constant mechanical stress. This function is particularly important in epithelial tissues, where maintaining a robust cellular architecture is necessary for barrier function and protection against physical and chemical insults. The activity of the EVPLL protein in these processes underscores its importance in cellular biology and its contribution to the overall structural integrity of tissues.
