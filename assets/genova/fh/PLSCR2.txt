# PLSCR2

## Overview
Phospholipid scramblase 2 (PLSCR2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of immune responses, particularly through its interaction with the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Unlike other members of the phospholipid scramblase family, PLSCR2 lacks intrinsic scramblase activity due to the absence of a proline-rich N-terminal region (Kodigepalli2014Roles). The protein encoded by PLSCR2 is primarily localized in the nucleus and plays a critical role in modulating the type I interferon (IFN-I) response by forming a complex with STAT3, which inhibits the recruitment of the ISGF3 complex to promoters of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (Tsai2018STAT3). This interaction is dependent on the palmitoylation of PLSCR2, which is essential for its binding to STAT3 and its function in immune regulation (Tsai2018STAT3). PLSCR2's involvement in immune signaling and its potential implications in cancer progression highlight its significance as a regulatory protein in cellular processes (Behuria2022Phospholipid).

## Structure


## Function
Phospholipid scramblase 2 (PLSCR2) is involved in the suppression of the type I interferon (IFN-I) response through its interaction with STAT3. PLSCR2 predominantly localizes in the nucleus and interacts with the N-terminal domain of STAT3, forming a complex that impedes the recruitment of the ISGF3 complex to promoters of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (Tsai2018STAT3). This interaction is crucial for its role in negatively regulating the IFN-I response, as it prevents ISGF3 from binding to ISRE-containing DNA, thereby suppressing the expression of ISGs and reducing antiviral responses (Tsai2018STAT3).

PLSCR2's suppressive effects are dependent on its palmitoylation, which is necessary for its binding to STAT3 and its ability to inhibit ISGF3 recruitment (Tsai2018STAT3). Despite its role in modulating immune responses, PLSCR2 lacks inherent scramblase activity due to the absence of a proline-rich N-terminal region, which is present in other PLSCR family members (Kodigepalli2014Roles). The specific function of PLSCR2 in healthy human cells remains largely unclear, but it is suggested to act as a negative regulator of IFN responses, potentially affecting immune responses (Tsai2018STAT3).

## Clinical Significance
PLSCR2 plays a significant role in immune regulation and cancer progression. Alterations in PLSCR2 expression or mutations affecting its interaction with STAT3 can lead to enhanced tumor progression and immune evasion, making it a potential target for cancer therapeutics. PLSCR2 is involved in the immune escape of tumor cells by regulating IFN-mediated immune signaling. It binds to the N-terminal domain of STAT3, inhibiting the STAT3-dependent promoter occupancy of the ISGF3 complex, which is crucial for the immune escape of tumor cells (Behuria2022Phospholipid).

PLSCR2 also suppresses the type I interferon (IFN-I) response, which is crucial for antiviral defense. It interacts with STAT3 and STAT2, impeding the recruitment of the ISGF3 complex to the promoters of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), thereby suppressing the antiviral response. This suppression is likely STAT2-dependent. Alterations in PLSCR2 expression or its interaction with STAT3 could impact the body's ability to mount an effective antiviral response (Tsai2018STAT3).

The palmitoylation of PLSCR2 is essential for its interaction with STAT3 and its suppressive activities. Mutations affecting its palmitoylation or interaction with STAT3 could potentially impact its role in regulating immune responses (Tsai2018STAT3).

## Interactions
Phospholipid scramblase 2 (PLSCR2) interacts with several proteins, notably STAT3 and STAT2, playing a significant role in modulating the type I interferon (IFN-I) response. PLSCR2 binds to the N-terminal domain of STAT3 through its palmitoylation motif, which is crucial for its function. This interaction suppresses the recruitment of the ISGF3 complex to promoters, thereby inhibiting the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and reducing antiviral responses (Tsai2018STAT3). The palmitoylation of PLSCR2 is essential for its binding to STAT3, and a palmitoylation-deficient mutant of PLSCR2 shows diminished suppressive effects on IFN-I-induced ISGs (Tsai2018STAT3).

PLSCR2 also interacts specifically with STAT2, but not with STAT1 or IRF9. This interaction is important for PLSCR2's ability to suppress the recruitment of ISGF3 to the promoters of ISGs, such as Ifit1 and Ifit3. The suppressive effect of PLSCR2 on ISGF3's DNA binding is enhanced by STAT3 and is dependent on STAT2 (Tsai2018STAT3). These interactions suggest that PLSCR2 is part of a regulatory axis involving STAT3 and STAT2 that modulates the IFN-I response.
