# KCNA3

## Overview
The KCNA3 gene encodes the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily A member 3, commonly referred to as the Kv1.3 channel. This protein is a transmembrane channel that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of potassium ion flow across the cell membrane, contributing to the maintenance of the resting membrane potential and modulation of cellular excitability. Kv1.3 channels are particularly significant in the immune system, where they influence T-cell activation and proliferation, as well as in the nervous system, where they affect neuronal signaling (PérezGarcía2018The; Cahalan2009The). Structurally, Kv1.3 is characterized by six transmembrane segments and forms a tetrameric assembly to function as a channel (PérezGarcía2018The). The channel's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications and interactions with various cellular proteins, which are crucial for its role in cellular signaling pathways (PérezGarcía2018The; Bowen2024Proximity). Alterations in KCNA3 expression or function are implicated in several pathological conditions, including autoimmune diseases and neuroinflammatory disorders, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Soldovieri2023De; Wang2020Kv1.3).

## Structure
The KCNA3 gene encodes the Kv1.3 protein, a voltage-gated potassium channel that is part of the shaker-related subfamily. The primary structure of Kv1.3 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the protein, which includes six transmembrane segments (S1-S6) and a pore loop between S5 and S6 (Soldovieri2023De; PérezGarcía2018The). The secondary structure involves these segments forming alpha helices, which contribute to the channel's voltage-sensing and pore domains. The tertiary structure is characterized by the folding of these helices into a three-dimensional shape, creating a pore through the cell membrane (PérezGarcía2018The).

The quaternary structure of Kv1.3 is a tetrameric assembly, where four subunits come together to form the functional channel (PérezGarcía2018The). The channel includes a voltage sensor domain (S1-S4) and a K+ selective pore domain (S5-S6), with the S4 segment containing positively charged amino acids that contribute to voltage dependence (PérezGarcía2018The). Common post-translational modifications include phosphorylation, which modulates channel activity and is influenced by voltage-induced conformational changes (PérezGarcía2018The; JiménezPérez2016Molecular). The protein also interacts with various cellular components, such as integrins and PDZ proteins, which help anchor it to the cytoskeleton and organize signaling complexes (PérezGarcía2018The).

## Function
The KCNA3 gene encodes the Kv1.3 potassium channel, a voltage-gated channel that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes. Kv1.3 channels are involved in setting the resting membrane potential and regulating the driving force for calcium influx, which is essential for cell cycle progression and volume regulation in growing cells (PérezGarcía2018The). These channels are expressed in multiple tissues, including the immune and nervous systems, where they influence cellular excitability and signal transduction (Cahalan2009The).

In T-cells, Kv1.3 channels are integral to activation and proliferation, facilitating potassium efflux and membrane hyperpolarization, which promotes calcium influx and activation of calcium-dependent transcriptional factors (PérezGarcía2018The; Cahalan2009The). They are also involved in coupling external integrin interactions to internal signal transduction, potentially through local accumulation of extracellular potassium at the immunological synapse (Cahalan2009The).

Kv1.3 channels are also present in mitochondria, where they increase oxidative phosphorylation, leading to higher production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which drives cellular proliferation. This mechanism is independent of the channel's ion-conducting properties, highlighting its role in linking cellular respiration to proliferation (Styles2021Kv1.3). The channels' activity is regulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which affects their interactions with other proteins and their role in cellular signaling pathways (PérezGarcía2018The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the KCNA3 gene, which encodes the Kv1.3 channel, are implicated in several diseases. In neuroinflammatory conditions such as multiple sclerosis (MS), Kv1.3 channels are highly expressed in myelin-reactive T cells, contributing to the disease's pathology by promoting T cell activation and cytokine production. Kv1.3 blockers have shown promise in reducing symptoms by inhibiting the proliferation of effector memory T cells without affecting naive or central memory T cells (Wang2020Kv1.3; Rus2005The).

In Alzheimer's disease, Kv1.3 channels are upregulated in microglia and T lymphocytes, contributing to neuroinflammation. Blocking Kv1.3 expression may reduce microglial activation and neurotoxicity, offering potential therapeutic benefits (Wang2020Kv1.3).

De novo variants in KCNA3 are associated with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE), characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, and epilepsy. These variants often result in loss-of-function effects, contributing to the pathophysiology of DEE (Soldovieri2023De).

In psoriasis, Kv1.3 channels are upregulated in memory T cells within psoriatic lesions. Kv1.3 blockers like PAP-1 have demonstrated efficacy in reducing T cell proliferation and cytokine production, suggesting a role in treating autoimmune disorders (KunduRaychaudhuri2014Kv1.3).

## Interactions
The KCNA3 gene encodes the Kv1.3 potassium channel, which is involved in various protein interactions, particularly in immune cells such as microglia. The channel interacts with proteins through its N-terminal and C-terminal domains, with each domain having distinct interaction profiles. The N-terminal domain is primarily associated with proteins involved in metabolic processing and trafficking to the cell surface and mitochondria, while the C-terminal domain interacts with signaling proteins, especially during inflammatory responses (Bowen2024Proximity).

In pro-inflammatory states, the C-terminal interactome of Kv1.3 is reorganized, showing increased interactions with immune signaling proteins such as STAT1, C3, and TLR2. The PDZ-binding domain in the C-terminus is crucial for these interactions, as its deletion alters the interaction profile (Bowen2024Proximity). Kv1.3 also interacts with mitochondrial proteins, suggesting a role in regulating apoptosis and mitochondrial function (Bowen2024Proximity).

The study of Kv1.3 interactions using proximity labeling proteomics has identified over 900 proteins interacting with the channel in HEK-293 and BV-2 microglial cells, highlighting its involvement in immune signaling and potential as a therapeutic target (Bowen2024Proximity).
