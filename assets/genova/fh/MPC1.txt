# MPC1

## Overview
MPC1 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1 protein, a crucial component of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) complex. This protein is integral to the transport of pyruvate across the inner mitochondrial membrane, a vital step in cellular respiration and energy production. As a transmembrane protein, mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1 forms a heterodimer with MPC2, facilitating the entry of pyruvate into mitochondria where it is converted into acetyl-CoA, thus fueling the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and supporting ATP synthesis through oxidative phosphorylation (Bricker2012A; Bender2016The). Beyond its role in energy metabolism, MPC1 is involved in regulating gluconeogenesis and glucose homeostasis, particularly in hepatic tissues (Gray2015Hepatic). Mutations or dysregulation of MPC1 have been implicated in various metabolic disorders and diseases, including lactic acidosis, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and pathological conditions (Ruiz-Iglesias2021The).

## Structure
MPC1 is a protein that forms part of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier complex, essential for transporting pyruvate into mitochondria. The primary structure of human MPC1 consists of 109 amino acid residues, including three cysteine residues that are crucial for its function (Dugan2017Mitochondrial). The secondary structure of MPC1 is characterized by a significant alpha-helix component, with three predicted transmembrane alpha-helices facilitating its integration into the mitochondrial inner membrane (Herzig2012Identification; Wang2023NMR).

In terms of tertiary structure, MPC1 is more compact and stable compared to its counterpart, MPC2, as indicated by its higher melting temperature (Lee2020Characteristic). The quaternary structure of MPC1 involves forming a heterodimer with MPC2, which is the predominant and more stable form, exhibiting higher substrate and inhibitor binding capacity (Bricker2012A; Lee2020Characteristic).

Post-translational modifications, such as acetylation at lysine residues, may regulate MPC1's function by interacting with ubiquitination and protein degradation pathways (Dugan2017Mitochondrial). These structural features and modifications are crucial for the protein's role in pyruvate transport and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Function
MPC1 (mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1) is a critical component of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) complex, which is essential for transporting pyruvate from the cytosol into the mitochondria. This transport is a key step in cellular respiration, as pyruvate is converted into acetyl-CoA by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, fueling the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and supporting ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation (Bricker2012A; Bender2016The). 

MPC1, along with MPC2, forms a heterooligomeric complex in the inner mitochondrial membrane, facilitating the transport of pyruvate into the mitochondria. This process is crucial for maintaining normal mitochondrial function and energy production in healthy human cells (Bender2016The; McCommis2015Mitochondrial). The stability and function of the MPC complex depend on the presence of both MPC1 and MPC2, as the deletion or downregulation of one subunit leads to the loss of the other, indicating their mutual stabilization (Bender2016The).

In addition to its role in energy metabolism, MPC1 is involved in regulating gluconeogenesis and glucose homeostasis, particularly in the liver. It is essential for efficient pyruvate-driven gluconeogenesis, linking cytosolic and mitochondrial metabolism (Gray2015Hepatic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MPC1 gene are linked to several metabolic disorders. These include lactic acidosis, hyperpyruvatemia, and pyruvate oxidation defects, often resulting in severe clinical manifestations such as hypotonia, facial dysmorphia, and metabolic acidosis. In some cases, these conditions can lead to premature death (Ruiz-Iglesias2021The). In the central nervous system, MPC1 mutations can contribute to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, with altered pyruvate and lactate levels observed in these conditions (Ruiz-Iglesias2021The).

In cancer, downregulation or loss of MPC1 is associated with increased glycolysis and tumorigenicity, contributing to the Warburg effect, which is characterized by enhanced glycolytic metabolism even in the presence of oxygen. This metabolic shift is linked to poor prognosis in various cancers, including prostate cancer, glioblastoma, and renal clear-cell carcinoma. Low MPC1 expression is associated with increased cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and resistance to therapies (Li2016MPC1; Bender2016The; Ruiz-Iglesias2021The).

In diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes, altered MPC1 activity affects glucose homeostasis and gluconeogenesis. Inhibition of MPC1 can reduce hepatic gluconeogenesis, offering potential therapeutic benefits for managing hyperglycemia (Gray2015Hepatic; Bender2016The).

## Interactions
MPC1, or mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1, is a critical component of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) complex, which facilitates the transport of pyruvate across the inner mitochondrial membrane. MPC1 forms heterodimers with either MPC2 or MPC3, which are essential for its function in pyruvate transport. These interactions are necessary for the formation of functional MPC complexes, as MPC1 is unstable when expressed alone and requires interaction with MPC2 or MPC3 to form active carriers (Bender2015Regulation; Bricker2012A).

MPC1 also interacts with STAT3, a transcription factor involved in cancer progression. This interaction occurs in the mitochondria, where MPC1 reduces the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT3, potentially altering the balance between cytoplasmic and mitochondrial STAT3. This interaction is significant in the context of lung adenocarcinoma, where MPC1 deficiency is associated with enhanced cancer cell stemness and progression (Zou2019MPC1).

In yeast, MPC1's interaction with MPC2 or MPC3 is regulated by the metabolic state, with different complexes forming under fermentative and respiratory conditions. This dynamic regulation allows for adaptation to environmental changes, highlighting the importance of MPC1 interactions in cellular metabolism (Bender2015Regulation).
