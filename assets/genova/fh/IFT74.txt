# IFT74

## Overview
IFT74 is a gene that encodes the intraflagellar transport 74 (IFT74) protein, a critical component of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system, specifically within the IFT-B complex. This protein plays a pivotal role in the assembly and maintenance of cilia, which are essential microtubule-based organelles involved in various cellular processes, including signaling and movement. IFT74, characterized by its coiled-coil domains, forms a heterodimer with IFT81, creating a tubulin-binding module necessary for the transport of tubulin to the ciliary tip, a process vital for cilium formation and function (Bhogaraju2013Molecular; Luo2021Disrupted). The gene's significance is underscored by its involvement in ciliopathies, where mutations can lead to disorders such as Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy and Bardet-Biedl syndrome, highlighting its crucial role in maintaining ciliary integrity and function (Zhongling2021Case; Bakey2023IFT74).

## Structure
IFT74 is a component of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system, specifically part of the IFT-B complex, which is essential for ciliary assembly and function. The primary structure of IFT74 includes a highly basic N-terminal region rich in lysines and arginines, forming a tubulin-binding domain in conjunction with IFT81. This domain is crucial for tubulin transport during ciliary assembly (Bakey2023IFT74). The secondary structure of IFT74 features coiled-coil domains that facilitate its interaction with other IFT-B subunits, such as IFT81, IFT70, and IFT88 (Lacey2023The; Bakey2023IFT74).

The tertiary structure of IFT74 involves its coiled-coil domains, which stabilize the IFT-B complex and enhance tubulin binding by interacting with the C-terminal tails of β-tubulin (Shi2019Intraflagellar). The quaternary structure of IFT74 is characterized by its assembly with IFT81 to form a heterodimer, which is crucial for the stability of the IFT-B complex (Luo2021Disrupted). IFT74 also interacts with other IFT-B proteins, such as IFT46 and IFT52, through its non-basic regions (Bakey2023IFT74).

Variants in IFT74, such as exon 2 deletions, can lead to structural alterations, affecting its ability to bind tubulin and resulting in ciliary dysfunction (Bakey2023IFT74).

## Function
IFT74 is a crucial component of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system, specifically part of the IFT-B complex, which is essential for the assembly and maintenance of cilia in human cells. Cilia are microtubule-based organelles that play significant roles in cell signaling and movement. IFT74 forms a heterodimer with IFT81, creating a tubulin-binding module necessary for the transport of tubulin to the ciliary tip, which is vital for cilium formation (Bhogaraju2013Molecular; Luo2021Disrupted).

The IFT74 protein interacts with other IFT-B subunits, such as IFT22 and the IFT25/27 dimer, to form the IFT-B inner core, which is involved in the transport of molecular cargo along the cilia (Luo2021Disrupted). This transport is critical for maintaining ciliary function and, consequently, various cellular processes, including signaling pathways like the Hedgehog signaling pathway (Luo2021Disrupted; Bakey2023IFT74).

In healthy cells, IFT74 is essential for the proper assembly and function of cilia, impacting processes such as lung health, fertility, and the establishment of the left-right body axis (Bakey2023IFT74). Disruptions in IFT74 can lead to ciliopathies, highlighting its importance in maintaining ciliary integrity and function (Luo2021Disrupted).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IFT74 gene are associated with a range of ciliopathies, which are disorders caused by ciliary dysfunction. In humans, IFT74 variants have been linked to skeletal ciliopathy and motile cilia defects, leading to conditions such as Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (ATD) and short-rib polydactyly syndrome (SRPS). These conditions are characterized by skeletal abnormalities, including a narrow thorax and growth retardation (Bakey2023IFT74). 

IFT74 mutations are also implicated in Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) and Joubert syndrome (JBTS). BBS is characterized by obesity, retinal dystrophy, polydactyly, and renal malformations, while JBTS is marked by developmental delay, hypotonia, and the molar tooth sign on brain MRI. Notably, JBTS associated with IFT74 mutations typically lacks renal and retinal anomalies (Kleinendorst2020Second; Zhongling2021Case). 

Specific mutations, such as exon 2 deletions, affect ciliary ultrastructure, leading to reduced cilia number and length, and altered motility. These mutations can result in severe phenotypes, including recurrent respiratory infections and renal disease (Bakey2023IFT74). The IFT74 gene's role in the intraflagellar transport system is crucial for ciliary function, and its disruption can lead to significant developmental and respiratory issues (Bakey2023IFT74).

## Interactions
IFT74 is a component of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system, specifically part of the IFT-B complex, and is crucial for ciliary assembly and function. It interacts with multiple other IFT-B subunits, forming a stable sub-complex with proteins such as IFT81, IFT27, and IFT25 (Taschner2012Architecture; Bakey2023IFT74). IFT74 and IFT81 display a similar structural organization with long coiled-coil regions, and they form a tubulin-binding module essential for ciliogenesis. This module enhances the tubulin-binding affinity of IFT81, with IFT74 interacting with the β-tubulin tail (Bhogaraju2013Molecular).

IFT74 is also involved in forming a heterotetramer with IFT81, as suggested by yeast two-hybrid studies, indicating a specific protein-protein interaction within the IFT-B complex (Taschner2012Architecture). The N-terminal region of IFT74, rich in lysines and arginines, is thought to work with IFT81 to form a tubulin-binding domain, facilitating tubulin transport during ciliary assembly (Bakey2023IFT74). Additionally, IFT74 interacts with other IFT-B proteins such as IFT70, IFT88, IFT46, IFT22, and IFT25, indicating its central role in the IFT particle structure (Bakey2023IFT74).
