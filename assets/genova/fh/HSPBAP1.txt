# HSPBAP1

## Overview
HSPBAP1, or HSPB1 associated protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cellular stress response regulation. The protein interacts with HSPB1, also known as HSP27, a small heat shock protein that functions as a molecular chaperone. HSPBAP1 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it plays a role in modulating the protective functions of HSP27, potentially inhibiting its ability to protect cells from stressors such as heat shock and oxidative stress (Jiang2001Molecular; Xi2007HSPBAP1). The gene is expressed in various tissues, with notable abundance in the thymus and pancreas, and is implicated in processes such as cell growth, apoptosis, and maintaining cellular integrity (Jiang2001Molecular). HSPBAP1's interactions and regulatory functions suggest its involvement in disease pathogenesis, including Kawasaki Disease and renal cell carcinoma, highlighting its clinical significance (Pavlovich2004Searching; Rashid2022Vasoactive).

## Function
HSPBAP1, or HSPB1 associated protein 1, is a protein that interacts with the small heat shock protein HSP27 (HSPB1), which is known for its role in protecting cells from stressors such as heat shock and oxidative stress. HSPBAP1 is involved in the regulation of stress responses in cells by modulating the functions of HSP27. It is suggested that HSPBAP1 may inhibit the protective function of HSP27, which acts as a molecular chaperone and is associated with microfilament organization (Jiang2001Molecular).

The protein encoded by HSPBAP1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences processes like protein folding and cellular stress responses, contributing to cellular homeostasis and survival. HSPBAP1 is expressed abundantly in the thymus and pancreas, with low expression in other adult tissues, and is absent in the brain under normal conditions (Jiang2001Molecular). The precise function of HSPBAP1 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, but it is implicated in regulating cell growth and apoptosis, potentially affecting cellular responses to stress and maintaining cellular integrity (Xi2007HSPBAP1).

## Clinical Significance
HSPBAP1 has been implicated in several diseases through mutations, alterations in expression levels, or disruptions in its normal interactions. In the context of congenital left-sided heart disease (LS-CHD), HSPBAP1 is part of a paternally inherited gain in a severely affected individual, suggesting its potential involvement in the disease's pathogenesis when combined with other genetic changes (Hitz2012Rare). The study highlights the complexity of gene dosage effects and the possibility of multiple genetic hits influencing disease expression (Hitz2012Rare).

In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), HSPBAP1 forms fusion transcripts with the DIRC3 gene, which may affect chromatin remodeling or stress-response signals, although the causative role of these translocations in RCC development remains to be determined (Pavlovich2004Searching). The fusion of DIRC3 lncRNA with HSPBAP1 due to a chromosomal translocation has been observed in a family with renal cell cancer, but the mechanistic consequences of this fusion are not yet fully understood (Aznaourova2020DiseaseCausing).

HSPBAP1 also interacts with the ALS-linked gene C9orf72, with a noted correlation in expression levels, suggesting a potential role in motor neuron diseases (Kitano2015Bioinformatics). However, the clinical significance of HSPBAP1 mutations or expression alterations in these contexts is not fully established.

## Interactions
HSPBAP1, also known as HSPB1 associated protein 1, is known to interact with the small heat shock protein HSPB1 (also referred to as HSP27). This interaction is significant in the regulation of cellular stress responses. HSPBAP1 has been shown to negatively regulate HSP27's ability to protect cells from heat shock, suggesting an inhibitory interaction that may modulate the stress response pathway (Di2024To). 

In the context of Kawasaki Disease, HSPBAP1 is implicated in controlling the HSP27 pathway, which is crucial for cellular responses to stressors such as heat shock and inflammation. The gene expression of HSPBAP1 significantly distinguishes Kawasaki Disease from control samples, indicating its potential role in disease pathogenesis through its interaction with HSP27 (Rashid2022Vasoactive).

HSPBAP1 is also involved in a fusion transcript with the DIRC3 gene due to a chromosomal translocation in familial renal cell cancer. This fusion retains the Hsp27 interaction domain, which is essential for HSPBAP1's function, highlighting the importance of its interaction with HSP27 in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Bodmer2003Disruption).
