# PROCA1

## Overview
PROCA1, or Protein Interacting with Cyclin A1, is a gene that encodes a proline-rich protein primarily involved in cell cycle regulation, particularly during the G1/S transition. The protein encoded by PROCA1 is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it is implicated in DNA replication and repair processes, contributing to normal cellular function and development (Diederichs2004Identification). Notably, PROCA1 is almost exclusively expressed in the testis, suggesting a significant role in meiosis and testicular function, with its expression being regulated during testis maturation and spermatogenesis (Diederichs2004Identification). The protein's interaction with cyclin A1, confirmed through yeast three-hybrid assays and GST pull-down assays, underscores its potential involvement in protein-protein interactions within the nucleus (Diederichs2004Identification). Additionally, PROCA1 has been implicated in various diseases, including lung adenocarcinoma and colorectal cancer, and is considered a candidate gene in intellectual disability and neurological disorders (Yang2021A; Tao2023Downregulation; Abedalthagafi2019Precsion).

## Structure


## Function
PROCA1, a proline-rich protein, interacts with cyclin A1 and is involved in cell cycle regulation, particularly during the G1/S transition. It is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it may play a role in DNA replication and repair processes, contributing to normal cellular function and development (Diederichs2004Identification). The interaction between PROCA1 and cyclin A1 has been confirmed through yeast three-hybrid assays and GST pull-down assays, indicating its potential involvement in protein-protein interactions within the nucleus (Diederichs2004Identification).

PROCA1 is almost exclusively expressed in the testis, with its expression regulated during testis maturation and spermatogenesis. This suggests a significant role in meiosis and testicular function (Diederichs2004Identification). The protein's expression is notably decreased in testis samples from infertile patients and testis tumors, highlighting its potential importance in maintaining normal testicular physiology (Diederichs2004Identification).

While the specific function of PROCA1 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its interaction with cyclin A1 and involvement in testicular processes suggest it plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation and reproductive health (Diederichs2004Identification).

## Clinical Significance
The PROCA1 gene has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its altered expression or interactions. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), PROCA1 is involved in the development of chemoresistance to cisplatin (DDP). The downregulation of LINC00173, a long non-coding RNA, leads to decreased PROCA1 expression, which is associated with increased BCL2 mRNA stability and reduced apoptosis, contributing to DDP resistance in LUAD cells (Tao2023Downregulation). Targeting the LINC00173/miR-1275/PROCA1/ZFP36L2 axis has been suggested as a potential therapeutic strategy to enhance DDP chemotherapy effectiveness in LUAD (Tao2023Downregulation).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), PROCA1 is part of a four-gene signature used to predict clinical outcomes. This signature, which includes lipid metabolism-related genes, serves as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in CRC patients, highlighting the gene's role in cancer progression (Yang2021A).

Additionally, PROCA1 has been identified as a candidate gene in intellectual disability and other neurological disorders, although specific clinical implications of its mutations remain unclear (Abedalthagafi2019Precsion). It is also mentioned in the context of autism spectrum disorder, where it is part of gene interaction networks related to synaptic function (BenítezBurraco2016The).

## Interactions
PROCA1, a protein interacting with cyclin A1, is involved in several key interactions that influence cellular processes. It has been identified as a proline-rich protein that interacts with cyclin A1, a regulatory protein involved in cell cycle control. This interaction was confirmed through yeast three-hybrid assays and GST pull-down assays, suggesting a role in cell cycle progression (Diederichs2004Identification).

In the context of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), PROCA1 interacts with ZFP36L2, a protein that binds to BCL2 mRNA and reduces its stability, thereby promoting apoptosis. This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, highlighting its role in enhancing chemosensitivity to cisplatin by activating the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway (Tao2023Downregulation).

PROCA1 is also regulated by the long non-coding RNA LINC00173, which acts as a competing endogenous RNA to bind miR-1275. This interaction prevents miR-1275 from repressing PROCA1 transcription, thereby influencing the sensitivity of LUAD cells to cisplatin (Tao2023Downregulation). These interactions underscore the multifaceted role of PROCA1 in cellular regulation and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
