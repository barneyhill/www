# NPTXR

## Overview
NPTXR, or neuronal pentraxin receptor, is a gene that encodes a receptor protein involved in synaptic function and plasticity within the central nervous system. The protein belongs to the neuronal pentraxin family, which also includes NPTX1 and NPTX2, and plays a critical role in the organization and stabilization of synaptic structures. As a receptor, NPTXR is anchored in the post-synaptic membrane and interacts with other pentraxins to modulate the stability and function of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs), thereby influencing excitatory synaptic transmission. The protein's expression is predominantly observed in the brain, particularly in regions such as the cerebral cortex and hippocampal formation, where it contributes to synaptic plasticity and homeostasis. Alterations in NPTXR expression have been linked to various pathological conditions, including gastric cancer and Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Gómez2021Neuronal; Kanda2020Therapeutic).

## Function
NPTXR, or neuronal pentraxin receptor, is a protein that plays a crucial role in synaptic function and plasticity in the central nervous system. It is part of the neuronal pentraxin family, which includes NPTX1 and NPTX2, and is involved in the organization and stabilization of synaptic structures. NPTXR is anchored in the post-synaptic membrane and interacts with NPTX1 and NPTX2, which are released into the synaptic cleft. This interaction stabilizes α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) in the post-synaptic membrane, modulating excitatory drive onto parvalbumin interneurons (Gómez2021Neuronal; Pelkey2015Pentraxins).

NPTXR is also involved in the internalization of AMPARs and NPTX complexes via endocytosis, which may protect against excitotoxicity. In NPTXR knock-out mice, there is a significant reduction in NPTX1 and NPTX2 levels, suggesting that NPTXR stabilizes these proteins at synapses (Gómez2021Neuronal). The protein is primarily expressed in the brain, particularly in the cerebral cortex and hippocampal formation, where it contributes to synaptic plasticity and homeostasis (Gómez2021Neuronal). NPTXR's role in synaptic plasticity is essential for maintaining synaptic stability and function in healthy human cells (Gómez2021Neuronal).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NPTXR gene have been implicated in several diseases, notably gastric cancer (GC) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In gastric cancer, increased NPTXR expression is associated with disease progression and metastasis. High levels of NPTXR mRNA correlate with poorer overall and disease-free survival, as well as a higher incidence of peritoneal, lymph node, and hematogenous recurrence in GC patients. This suggests that NPTXR may serve as an independent prognostic factor and could reflect resistance to postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy (Kanda2020Therapeutic). Knockdown or knockout of NPTXR in GC cell lines results in reduced proliferation, migration, and invasion, indicating its role in promoting oncogenic behaviors (Kanda2020Therapeutic).

In Alzheimer's disease, NPTXR levels in cerebrospinal fluid decrease with increasing disease severity, correlating with cognitive decline as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. This pattern suggests that NPTXR could serve as a biomarker for AD progression, helping to differentiate between stages of the disease (Lim2019Liquid). The changes in NPTXR levels may be related to synaptic dysfunction, a key feature of AD pathology (Gómez2021Neuronal).

## Interactions
The neuronal pentraxin receptor (NPTXR) is involved in various protein interactions that play a crucial role in synapse organization and function. NPTXR interacts with AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) at excitatory synapses, stabilizing these receptors on the cell surface and enhancing their function. This interaction is mediated through the binding of NPTXR's pentraxin domain to the GluA1 N-terminal domain (GluA1-NTD), facilitating trans-synaptic interactions and synapse formation (Lee2016Presynaptic).

NPTXR also forms complexes with other neuronal pentraxins, such as NP1 and NARP, which are secreted proteins. These interactions are important for the recruitment and stabilization of these proteins at the synaptic membrane, influencing synaptic strength and plasticity (Gómez2021Neuronal). NPTXR is proposed to act as a receptor for NPTX1 and NPTX2, forming heterocomplexes that stabilize AMPARs in the postsynaptic membrane (Gómez2021Neuronal).

In addition, NPTXR interacts with the C1QL3 protein, forming a complex with NPTX1 and the adhesion GPCR ADGRB3. This complex is involved in promoting cell-cell adhesion, which may influence synapse density (Sticco2020C1QL3). These interactions highlight NPTXR's role in synaptic organization and its potential impact on neuronal communication.
