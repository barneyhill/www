# IRAG1

## Overview
IRAG1 is a gene that encodes the protein inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor associated 1, which is a key component in cellular signaling pathways. This protein is categorized as a regulatory protein due to its involvement in modulating the activity of other proteins, such as the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors and the HCN4 channel isoform. The interaction of IRAG1 with IP3 receptors is crucial for the regulation of calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum, particularly within the nitric oxide (NO)/cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)/cGMP-dependent protein kinase I (PKG I) signaling pathway (Peters2022Regulation). Additionally, IRAG1 acts as a partial cAMP mimetic, influencing the voltage-dependence of HCN4 channels, which are vital for cardiac pacemaking and heart rate regulation (Peters2022Regulation). The protein's expression throughout the mouse heart underscores its potential role in cardiac function (Peters2022Regulation).

## Function


## Interactions
IRAG1, also known as inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor associated 1, is involved in several protein interactions that play a crucial role in cellular signaling pathways. It is part of the inositol trisphosphate receptor-associated guanylate kinase substrate proteins and interacts with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors. This interaction is significant for regulating calcium (Ca2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum, particularly in response to the nitric oxide (NO)/cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)/cGMP-dependent protein kinase I (PKG I) signaling pathway (Peters2022Regulation).

IRAG1 has been identified as a specific regulator of the HCN4 channel isoform, acting as a partial cAMP mimetic. It shifts the voltage-dependence of HCN4 to more depolarized potentials in the absence of cAMP, suggesting a role in heart rate regulation due to HCN4's critical function in cardiac pacemaking (Peters2022Regulation). The protein is expressed in all regions of the mouse heart, indicating its potential involvement in controlling heart rate (Peters2022Regulation).

While IRAG1's interactions with nucleic acids are not detailed, its role in modulating HCN4 channels and interacting with IP3 receptors highlights its importance in cellular signaling and cardiac function (Peters2022Regulation).
