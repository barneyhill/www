# GUCA1C

## Overview
The GUCA1C gene encodes the protein guanylate cyclase activator 1C (GCAP3), which is a member of the calmodulin gene superfamily and functions as a calcium-binding protein. GCAP3 plays a pivotal role in the phototransduction pathway within retinal photoreceptor cells by modulating the activity of guanylate cyclases, enzymes that synthesize cyclic GMP (cGMP), a crucial second messenger in visual signal transduction (Haeseleer1999Molecular; MoralesCámara2020Role). The protein is characterized by three EF-hand motifs that facilitate calcium ion binding and undergoes N-myristoylation, which may affect its functional properties and localization (Haeseleer1999Molecular). Beyond its role in vision, GCAP3 is also implicated in the regulation of intraocular pressure, potentially influencing aqueous humor dynamics in ocular tissues (MoralesCámara2020Role). While GUCA1C has been studied for its potential involvement in primary congenital glaucoma, the evidence remains inconclusive, necessitating further investigation to elucidate its clinical significance (Souzeau2021An; MoralesCámara2020Role).

## Function
The GUCA1C gene encodes the guanylate cyclase activator 1C (GCAP3), a protein involved in the regulation of phototransduction in retinal cells. GCAP3 is a calcium-binding protein that belongs to the calmodulin gene superfamily and is primarily active in the photoreceptor cells of the retina. It plays a crucial role in modulating the activity of guanylate cyclases, enzymes responsible for synthesizing cyclic GMP (cGMP), a key second messenger in visual signal transduction (Haeseleer1999Molecular; MoralesCámara2020Role).

GCAP3 contains three EF-hand motifs that bind calcium ions, and it undergoes N-myristoylation, a post-translational modification that may influence its function and localization. The protein is involved in the desensitization process of photoreceptors by regulating cGMP levels, which is essential for light adaptation and normal visual function (Haeseleer1999Molecular).

In addition to its role in phototransduction, GCAP3 is present in human ocular tissues, including the ciliary epithelium, where it may contribute to the regulation of intraocular pressure by influencing aqueous humor dynamics. This function suggests a potential role in maintaining the balance between aqueous humor production and drainage, which is crucial for normal eye function (MoralesCámara2020Role).

## Clinical Significance
The GUCA1C gene has been investigated for its potential role in primary congenital glaucoma (PCG), a severe optical neuropathy characterized by increased intraocular pressure and optic nerve damage. A low-frequency homozygous nonsense variant (p.(Glu18Ter)) in GUCA1C was identified in two siblings with PCG, suggesting a possible link to the disease. However, this variant was also found in some control individuals, and its frequency in the general population was higher than expected for a pathogenic variant, indicating it may not be directly pathogenic for PCG or could exhibit incomplete penetrance (Souzeau2021An; MoralesCámara2020Role).

In zebrafish models, knockout of the guca1c gene resulted in retinal ganglion cell apoptosis and gliosis, which are indicative of glaucoma-like damage. This suggests that GUCA1C may contribute to PCG pathogenesis, although the disease is genetically heterogeneous and often involves other genes (MoralesCámara2020Role).

Despite these findings, the evidence does not strongly support the pathogenicity of GUCA1C mutations in PCG, and further research is needed to confirm any potential associations (Souzeau2021An). The gene has not been strongly associated with other specific diseases according to current studies (Miller2021A).
