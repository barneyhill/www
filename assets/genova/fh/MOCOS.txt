# MOCOS

## Overview
The MOCOS gene encodes the enzyme molybdenum cofactor sulfurase, which is essential for the activation of molybdenum-dependent hydroxylases, such as aldehyde oxidase and xanthine oxidase. This enzyme is categorized as a sulfurase, functioning primarily in the cytoplasm to facilitate the transfer of sulfur to the molybdenum cofactor, a critical step in the metabolism of sulfur-containing compounds and purine degradation (Stiburkova2018Thiopurineinduced; Schwarz2009Molybdenum). The proper function of MOCOS is vital for detoxification processes in the liver and kidneys, and its dysfunction can lead to metabolic disorders like hereditary xanthinuria (Stiburkova2018Thiopurineinduced). Additionally, variations in the MOCOS gene have been associated with neuropsychiatric and developmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders, highlighting its broader significance in human health (Féron2015Olfactory; Taheri2020The).

## Function
MOCOS (molybdenum cofactor sulfurase) is a crucial enzyme involved in the maturation of molybdenum hydroxylases, such as aldehyde oxidase and xanthine oxidase, by adding a terminal sulfido ligand to the molybdenum center, which is essential for their enzymatic activity (Schwarz2009Molybdenum). MOCOS functions as a homodimer with two main domains: the N-terminal NifS-like domain, which abstracts sulfur from L-cysteine to form a persulfide intermediate, and the C-terminal Moco-binding domain, which transfers this sulfur to the molybdenum cofactor (Moco) (Schwarz2009Molybdenum). This process is vital for the proper metabolism of thiopurine drugs and the purine degradation pathway in healthy human cells (Stiburkova2018Thiopurineinduced).

MOCOS is active in the cytoplasm, where it plays a significant role in the metabolism of sulfur-containing compounds, contributing to detoxification processes in the liver and kidneys (Stiburkova2018Thiopurineinduced). Dysfunction in MOCOS can lead to metabolic disorders such as hereditary xanthinuria, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular and organismal functions (Stiburkova2018Thiopurineinduced).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the MOCOS gene have been implicated in several neuropsychiatric and developmental disorders. MOCOS is involved in purine metabolism and its downregulation has been observed in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). This downregulation is associated with increased oxidative stress sensitivity and defects in neurotransmission and synaptic function, potentially contributing to the clinical manifestations of ASD (Féron2015Olfactory). 

A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within the MOCOS gene, rs594445, has been linked to an increased risk of ASD, as well as methamphetamine addiction and bipolar disorder type 1 (BP1) in certain genetic models (Taheri2020The; Safa2020A). The A allele of rs594445 is more prevalent among ASD cases, suggesting it as a risk locus for the disorder (Taheri2020The).

Additionally, the impaired expression of the COSMOC/MOCOS gene unit, including the long noncoding RNA COSMOC, is associated with disturbances in redox homeostasis and synaptogenesis, which are linked to neurodevelopmental deficits in ASD (Rontani2020Impaired). These findings highlight the potential role of MOCOS in the pathogenesis of ASD and other neuropsychiatric conditions.
