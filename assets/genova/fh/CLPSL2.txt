# CLPSL2

## Overview
The CLPSL2 gene encodes the protein colipase-like 2, which is a member of the colipase family. This protein is involved in lipid metabolism, functioning as a cofactor for pancreatic lipase, thereby facilitating the efficient digestion of dietary fats. Colipase-like 2 is characterized by its structural similarity to colipase, although its precise biological role and regulatory mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. The gene is expressed in various tissues, suggesting a potentially broader role in lipid homeostasis beyond the digestive system. Understanding the function and regulation of CLPSL2 could provide insights into metabolic disorders and contribute to the development of therapeutic strategies (Qiu2020aarFDC).
