# RAD51B

## Overview
RAD51B is a gene that encodes the protein RAD51 paralog B, which is a crucial component of the homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathway, a key mechanism for repairing DNA double-strand breaks. The RAD51B protein is part of the RAD51 paralog family, which includes other proteins such as RAD51C, RAD51D, XRCC2, and XRCC3. These proteins form complexes that facilitate the early stages of homologous recombination, particularly by mediating the assembly of the presynaptic RAD51 filament, which is essential for DNA pairing and strand exchange processes (Sigurdsson2001Mediator; Takata2000The). RAD51B is involved in forming the BCDX2 complex, which plays a significant role in maintaining genomic stability by binding to various DNA substrates and exhibiting ATPase activity (Bonilla2020RAD51). The gene's function is critical for proper chromosome segregation and centrosome integrity, and its haploinsufficiency can lead to chromosomal instability (Date2006Haploinsufficiency). Mutations in RAD51B have been linked to increased cancer risk, highlighting its importance in genomic maintenance and cancer biology (Setton2021Germline; Xie2022RAD51B).

## Structure
The RAD51B protein is a member of the RAD51 paralog family, which plays a crucial role in homologous recombinational repair (HRR) of DNA. The protein contains an ATPase domain characterized by conserved Walker A and B motifs, essential for ATP binding and hydrolysis (Bonilla2020RAD51). These motifs are critical for the protein's function in DNA repair processes.

RAD51B forms part of the BCDX2 complex, which includes RAD51C, RAD51D, and XRCC2, indicating its involvement in quaternary structures (Bonilla2020RAD51). This complex is known to bind various DNA substrates and exhibits ATPase activity stimulated by single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) (Bonilla2020RAD51). The Rad51B-Rad51C complex, specifically, has been shown to bind ssDNA more readily than double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and possesses ssDNA-stimulated ATPase activity (Sigurdsson2001Mediator).

While specific details about the secondary and tertiary structures of RAD51B are not provided, its role in forming nucleoprotein filaments with RAD51 suggests a structural configuration that supports filament assembly and stabilization (Bonilla2020RAD51). The protein's interactions with other paralogs and its involvement in DNA repair highlight its structural and functional significance in maintaining genomic stability.

## Function
The RAD51B gene encodes a protein that is integral to the process of homologous recombination, a critical mechanism for DNA repair in human cells. RAD51B is part of the RAD51 paralog group, which includes RAD51C, RAD51D, XRCC2, and XRCC3. These proteins form complexes that assist in the early stages of homologous recombination, particularly in the repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA (Date2006Haploinsufficiency; Takata2000The).

RAD51B, in conjunction with RAD51C, forms a complex that acts as a mediator in the assembly of the presynaptic RAD51 filament. This complex is crucial for overcoming the suppressive effects of the single-strand binding protein RPA, facilitating RAD51-mediated DNA pairing and strand exchange (Sigurdsson2001Mediator). RAD51B is also necessary for the formation of RAD51 nuclear foci, which are indicative of active DNA repair processes (Takata2000The).

In healthy human cells, RAD51B plays a vital role in maintaining genomic stability by ensuring proper chromosome segregation and centrosome integrity. Haploinsufficiency of RAD51B can lead to centrosome fragmentation and aneuploidy, conditions associated with chromosomal instability (Date2006Haploinsufficiency). The gene's function is critical during the S phase of the cell cycle, where it helps repair chromosomal breaks that occur during DNA replication (Takata2000The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RAD51B gene have been implicated in several cancers, including breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and glioma. Germline mutations in RAD51B are associated with an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancers, particularly in non-Caucasian populations. These mutations often result in homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), making tumors potentially sensitive to HRD-targeting therapies like PARP inhibitors (Setton2021Germline). In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), RAD51B mutations are linked to structural variations such as translocations and deletions, contributing to genomic instability and cancer progression (Xie2022RAD51B).

RAD51B haploinsufficiency, where a single functional copy of the gene is insufficient, leads to centrosome fragmentation and aneuploidy, contributing to chromosome instability and potentially tumorigenesis (Date2006Haploinsufficiency). In glioma, the RAD51B enhancer variant rs6573816 is associated with lower gene expression and a decreased risk of the disease, suggesting that overexpression might be a risk factor (Huang2023Identification). These findings underscore the complex role of RAD51B in cancer biology, where its expression levels and mutations can significantly impact cancer risk and progression.

## Interactions
RAD51B is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in homologous recombinational repair (HRR). It directly interacts with Rad51C, and this interaction is essential for forming the BCDX2 complex, which includes Rad51D and XRCC2. This complex preferentially binds to synthetic Holliday junctions and branched DNA structures, indicating its role in maintaining genomic stability (Miller2005Nuclear).

RAD51B also interacts with XRCC3, enhancing the binding of Rad51C to XRCC3 and Rad51D. These interactions suggest that RAD51B may participate in forming heterotrimeric complexes with other Rad51 paralogs, which are important for DNA repair and recombination processes (Schild2000Evidence). The interaction between RAD51B and Rad51D is indirect and mediated by Rad51C, as confirmed by experiments using yeast two-hybrid and baculovirus systems (Schild2000Evidence).

Despite its interactions with other Rad51 paralogs, RAD51B does not directly interact with BRCA2, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid analyses (Miller2005Nuclear). RAD51B's nuclear localization is independent of BRCA2, suggesting it has its own nuclear localization signal (Miller2005Nuclear).
