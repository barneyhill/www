# CNST

## Overview
The CNST gene encodes consortin, a connexin sorting protein that plays a pivotal role in the trafficking of connexins to the plasma membrane. Consortin is categorized as a transmembrane protein and functions as a trans-Golgi network (TGN) cargo receptor. It is integral to the formation and maintenance of gap junctions, which are crucial for cell-cell communication. The protein exists in two isoforms, with the longer isoform containing a transmembrane segment and specific regions for connexin binding. Consortin's interactions with TGN clathrin adaptors, such as GGA1 and GGA2, facilitate the proper targeting of connexins, ensuring their functional integration into the plasma membrane. This process is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and intercellular communication. The CNST gene has also been implicated in various clinical conditions, including acute myeloid leukemia and osteosarcoma, where its expression levels correlate with disease progression and prognosis (Liu2022CNST; Hu2021Blocking; del2009Consortin).

## Structure
Consortin, encoded by the CNST gene, is an integral membrane protein involved in the trafficking of connexins to the plasma membrane. The protein is characterized by two isoforms: a short isoform consisting of 422 amino acids and a long isoform with 711 amino acids. The long isoform includes a transmembrane segment and regions for binding to connexins Cx26 and Cx30 (del2009Consortin). Consortin is described as an intrinsically disordered protein, with 65-76% of its residues not forming well-organized structures. It lacks an amino-terminal signal peptide and contains a hydrophobic stretch near the C-terminus, suggesting it is a type-II membrane protein (del2009Consortin).

Structurally, consortin has a well-structured C-terminal tail likely forming a globular domain, while its N-terminal segment, which interacts with connexins, is highly disordered (del2009Consortin). The protein interacts with TGN clathrin adaptors GGA1 and GGA2 through a specific peptide motif, which is conserved across consortin orthologs (del2009Consortin). The DXXLL motif, located within a disordered region, is notable for its role in adaptor protein interactions (del2009Consortin).

## Function
Consortin, encoded by the CNST gene, is a trans-Golgi network (TGN) cargo receptor that plays a critical role in the trafficking and recycling of connexins to the plasma membrane in healthy human cells. Connexins are integral membrane proteins that form gap junctions, which are essential for cell-cell communication by allowing the passage of ions and small molecules between adjacent cells (del2009Consortin).

Consortin is primarily localized in the perinuclear region, overlapping with Golgi complex markers, and is also found in a punctate pattern throughout the cytoplasm and up to the cell membrane. It is present in tubulo-vesicular structures on the trans side of the Golgi apparatus, indicating its involvement in trafficking between the TGN and the plasma membrane (del2009Consortin). The protein interacts with TGN clathrin adaptors GGA1 and GGA2, which are necessary for the assembly of clathrin-coated vesicles, facilitating the proper targeting of connexins to the plasma membrane (del2009Consortin).

Silencing of consortin expression leads to intracellular accumulation of connexins and a reduction in connexin plaques at the plasma membrane, highlighting its essential role in maintaining proper connexin trafficking and function (del2009Consortin). This function is crucial for the formation of functional gap junctions, which are vital for intercellular communication and maintaining cellular homeostasis (del2009Consortin).

## Clinical Significance
The CNST gene, known as consortin, connexin sorting protein, is clinically significant due to its association with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and osteosarcoma (OS). In AML, CNST is overexpressed and correlates with poor prognosis. Its expression is notably higher in AML patients compared to healthy individuals, and it is particularly elevated in relapsed cases. CNST expression is highest in AML subtypes with the RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion protein, suggesting a regulatory relationship. This overexpression is linked to poor differentiation in myeloid cells and is prevalent in leukemia stem cells (LSCs), contributing to drug resistance and immune evasion (Liu2022CNST).

In osteosarcoma, circ-CNST, a circular RNA derived from the CNST gene, is upregulated and associated with poor clinical outcomes, including shorter overall survival and advanced disease stages. Circ-CNST acts as a competing endogenous RNA, influencing glycolysis and malignant behaviors in OS cells. Knocking down circ-CNST reduces cell proliferation, migration, and glycolysis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Hu2021Blocking). These findings underscore the role of CNST in cancer progression and its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in AML and OS.

## Interactions
Consortin (CNST) is a protein that plays a crucial role in the trafficking and targeting of connexins to the plasma membrane. It interacts directly with several connexins, including Cx26, Cx30, Cx31, Cx32, Cx43, and Cx45, as demonstrated by GST pulldown assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments (del2009Consortin). These interactions are essential for the proper localization and function of connexins, which are integral components of gap junctions.

Consortin also interacts with the trans-Golgi network (TGN) clathrin adaptors GGA1 and GGA2, which are involved in the sorting and vesicle formation processes at the TGN. This interaction is mediated by a specific acidic cluster-dileucine (DXXLL) motif within consortin, which is recognized by the GGA adaptors (del2009Consortin). The interaction with GGA adaptors is crucial for the TGN-to-plasma membrane trafficking of connexins, and disruption of this interaction leads to intracellular accumulation of connexins (del2009Consortin).

Consortin's role extends to potentially interacting with other adaptor proteins, such as AP1, AP2, and AP3, suggesting its involvement in broader transport pathways within the cell (del2009Consortin). However, consortin does not interact with pannexin 1, a protein similar in topology to connexins (del2009Consortin).
