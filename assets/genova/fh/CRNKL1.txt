# CRNKL1

## Overview
CRNKL1, or crooked neck pre-mRNA splicing factor 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing, a fundamental process in gene expression. The protein encoded by CRNKL1 is a component of the spliceosome, a complex responsible for the precise removal of introns from pre-mRNA, ensuring accurate mRNA processing before translation into proteins. This protein is categorized as a splicing factor and is active in the nucleus, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining the efficiency and fidelity of gene expression. The proper functioning of CRNKL1 is essential for cellular homeostasis and has implications in various biological processes and diseases, including its potential role as a prognostic biomarker in certain cancers (Li2017Protein; Jayaraman2014Mutational).

## Function
CRNKL1, or crooked neck pre-mRNA splicing factor 1, is a protein involved in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing, a critical process in gene expression. It functions as part of the spliceosome, a complex responsible for removing introns from pre-mRNA, ensuring that mRNA is accurately processed before translation into proteins. This process is essential for maintaining proper protein synthesis and cellular function. CRNKL1 is active in the nucleus, where it plays a significant role in the precise splicing of pre-mRNA, impacting the overall efficiency and fidelity of gene expression. The accurate processing of mRNA by CRNKL1 is crucial for the production of functional proteins, which are necessary for various cellular activities and organismal development. The role of CRNKL1 in pre-mRNA splicing highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential impact on various biological processes.

## Clinical Significance
CRNKL1 has been identified as a potential prognostic biomarker in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Studies have shown that CRNKL1 can stratify EAC patients into high-risk and low-risk groups more effectively than traditional biomarkers, with a sensitivity of 83.33% and specificity of 78.57% (Li2017Protein). This suggests that alterations in CRNKL1 expression levels may be significant in the prognosis of EAC.

In basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), CRNKL1 has been found to have a hotspot mutation (S128F) in several tumors, which has not been previously documented in cancer mutation databases. This mutation could lead to splicing defects due to CRNKL1's role in pre-mRNA splicing, potentially contributing to cancer development (Jayaraman2014Mutational).

CRNKL1 is also involved in fusion transcripts in breast cancer, such as the CRNKL1-RHOBTB3 fusion, which may serve as biomarkers or therapeutic targets (Asmann2012Detection). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CRNKL1 in various cancers, where its mutations or altered expression can impact disease progression and patient outcomes.

## Interactions
CRNKL1, or crooked neck pre-mRNA splicing factor 1, is involved in interactions within the spliceosome, a complex essential for pre-mRNA splicing. It interacts with PPIL1, a nuclear cyclophilin, within the Bact complex of the spliceosome. This interaction is part of a network involving other proteins such as SNW1, RBM22, and CDC5L, although the specific details of CRNKL1's role in these interactions are not fully elucidated (Rajiv2018Structural). 

CRNKL1 is also identified as a potential RNA-binding protein (RBP) with cross-link rates above the 0.1% threshold, suggesting it may interact with RNA. However, due to insufficient protein purification, the confident assignment of its RNA interactions remains challenging (Porter2021easyCLIP). 

In addition to its role in the spliceosome, CRNKL1 was identified in a study focused on aggresome formation, where it was listed among genes that, when knocked down, inhibited aggresome formation. This suggests a potential role in protein aggregation processes, although specific interactions in this context are not detailed (Zaarur2015RuvbL1).
