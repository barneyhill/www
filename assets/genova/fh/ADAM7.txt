# ADAM7

## Overview
ADAM7 is a gene that encodes the ADAM metallopeptidase domain 7 protein, a member of the ADAM (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase) family. This family is characterized by a conserved multidomain structure, although ADAM7 itself is catalytically inactive due to mutations in its metalloprotease domain (Takeda2016ADAM). The protein is predominantly expressed in the epididymis and plays a crucial role in sperm development and function, particularly during sperm capacitation, where it is integrated into the sperm plasma membrane (Han2011Identification; Su2009ADAM7). ADAM7 is involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, facilitated by its domain structure, and interacts with several proteins, including heat shock protein 5 (Hspa5) and calnexin (Canx), which are important for sperm function (Han2011Identification). Despite lacking proteolytic activity, ADAM7 may influence intracellular signaling pathways through its cytoplasmic domain, which contains potential SH3 binding sites (EDWARDS2008The). Its expression and regulatory features suggest a significant role in reproductive biology and possibly other cellular processes.

## Structure
ADAM7 is a member of the ADAM (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase) family, characterized by a conserved multidomain structure. This structure includes an N-terminal signal sequence, a pro-domain, and metalloprotease, disintegrin, cysteine-rich, EGF-like, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains (Han2011Identification; Su2009ADAM7). Despite its classification as a metalloprotease, ADAM7 lacks proteolytic activity due to mutations in its catalytic site, which is a common feature among some ADAM family members (Takeda2016ADAM).

ADAM7 is specifically expressed in the epididymis and is transferred to the sperm surface during epididymal transit, where it becomes integrated into the sperm plasma membrane (Su2009ADAM7). The protein is associated with lipid rafts in the sperm membrane, suggesting a role in membrane organization and protein interactions during sperm capacitation (Han2011Identification).

ADAM7 interacts with several proteins, including heat shock protein 5 (Hspa5), calnexin (Canx), and integral membrane protein 2B (Itm2b), forming complexes that are important for sperm function (Han2011Identification). These interactions are facilitated by the protein's domain structure, which supports its role in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions.

## Function
ADAM7 is a member of the ADAM family of proteins, which are involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. Although ADAM7 lacks the conserved peptidase motif necessary for catalytic activity, it plays a role in cell adhesion and signaling processes. It is highly expressed in the testis and is associated with sperm development, suggesting a role in reproductive biology (Stone1999Structure–Function; Brocker2009Evolutionary). ADAM7 is found on the apical surface of epithelial cells in the caput region of the epididymis and is regulated by androgens, indicating its involvement in the male reproductive system (Wolfsberg1995ADAM).

Despite its lack of proteolytic activity, ADAM7 may participate in intracellular signaling through its cytoplasmic domain, which contains potential SH3 binding sites. These sites could facilitate interactions with other proteins, influencing signaling pathways and cellular responses (EDWARDS2008The). The specific molecular mechanisms and organismal outcomes of ADAM7's functions in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated, but its expression pattern and regulatory features suggest a significant role in reproductive processes and possibly in other cell signaling contexts.

## Interactions
ADAM7, a member of the ADAM family of proteins, is involved in various protein interactions, particularly in the context of sperm function. In mouse sperm, ADAM7 interacts with heat shock protein 5 (Hspa5), calnexin (Canx), and integral membrane protein 2B (Itm2b). These interactions were identified using proteomic analysis and confirmed through immunoprecipitation-Western blot analyses (Han2011Identification). Hspa5 and Canx are molecular chaperones, while Itm2b is a type II integral membrane protein associated with neurodegeneration (Han2011Identification).

The interaction between ADAM7 and Itm2b is particularly significant during sperm capacitation, a process that enhances the sperm's ability to fertilize an egg. This interaction is significantly increased during capacitation, suggesting a conformational change in ADAM7 that promotes its association with Itm2b (Han2011Identification). ADAM7 is also associated with epididymal vesicles, which facilitate its transfer to the sperm plasma membrane, indicating its role in sperm maturation and fertilization (Su2009ADAM7). These interactions highlight ADAM7's role in forming multiprotein complexes critical for sperm function.
