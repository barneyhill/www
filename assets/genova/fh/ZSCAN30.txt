# ZSCAN30

## Overview
ZSCAN30 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger and SCAN domain containing 30 protein, which is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs and a SCAN domain. These structural features suggest that the protein may function as a transcription factor, potentially regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. The protein is implicated in various biological processes, including immune response pathways, as evidenced by its involvement in the protein-protein interaction network during SARS-CoV-2 infection (Vastrad2020Bioinformatics). Additionally, ZSCAN30 has been associated with chromosomal translocations, such as the t(5;18)(p15;q11) translocation, which may affect its expression and function (Hofmeister2014CTNND2—a). Despite these insights, the full range of ZSCAN30's biological roles and clinical significance remains to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
ZSCAN30 is identified as a hub gene in the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network constructed for upregulated genes in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This designation indicates that ZSCAN30 has a high node degree, betweenness centrality, stress centrality, and closeness centrality, along with a low clustering coefficient, suggesting its significant role in the network. The PPI network for these upregulated genes consists of 4957 edges and 3395 nodes, highlighting the extensive interactions in which ZSCAN30 is involved. Pathway and Gene Ontology enrichment analysis for these upregulated genes, including ZSCAN30, revealed significant enrichment in pathways such as the adaptive immune system, interferon signaling, TCR signaling in naive CD4+ T cells, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. This suggests that ZSCAN30 may play a role in immune response pathways during SARS-CoV-2 infection (Vastrad2020Bioinformatics).

In a separate study, ZSCAN30 was involved in a chromosomal translocation, t(5;18)(p15;q11), affecting its expression. The translocation resulted in a fusion with the CTNND2 gene, suggesting a potential loss-of-function mutation. However, there is limited information on ZSCAN30's expression in the brain, although it has been detected in postnatal mice (Hofmeister2014CTNND2—a).
