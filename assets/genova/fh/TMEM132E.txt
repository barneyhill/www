# TMEM132E

## Overview
TMEM132E is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 132E, which is a crucial component of cellular architecture and communication. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein due to its role in linking the extracellular environment to the intracellular actin cytoskeleton, thereby maintaining cellular integrity and facilitating signal transduction (Liaqat2019Further). TMEM132E is expressed in various tissues, including the inner ear, brain, and several vital organs, underscoring its importance in diverse physiological processes (Liaqat2019Further). The protein is particularly significant in neural development and function, contributing to cell adhesion and signaling pathways essential for maintaining neural connectivity (Liaqat2019Further). Variants in the TMEM132E gene have been linked to autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing impairment and other neurological and psychiatric disorders, highlighting its clinical relevance (Gottmann2020Polymorphisms; LluciàCarol2023Genetic).

## Structure


## Function
The TMEM132E gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular structure and function by linking the extracellular environment to the intracellular actin cytoskeleton. This connection is essential for cellular integrity and communication, as it helps maintain the structural framework of cells and facilitates signal transduction processes (Liaqat2019Further). TMEM132E is highly expressed in the inner ear and other tissues, including the brain, kidney, lung, liver, spleen, heart, small intestine, colon, thymus, and stomach, indicating its widespread importance in various physiological processes (Liaqat2019Further).

In healthy human cells, the TMEM132E protein is involved in cell adhesion and signaling, contributing to neural development and function. Its expression in the brain suggests a role in maintaining neural connectivity and communication, which is vital for proper neurological function (Liaqat2019Further). The protein's involvement in these cellular processes underscores its significance in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of cells across different tissues. Variants in the TMEM132E gene have been associated with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing impairment, highlighting its role in auditory function and the potential consequences of its dysfunction (Liaqat2019Further).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TMEM132E gene have been implicated in several medical conditions, most notably autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing impairment (ARNSHI). This condition is characterized by hearing loss without other associated symptoms. Specific compound heterozygous variants, such as c.382G>T: p.(Ala128Ser) and c.2204C>T: p.(Pro735Leu), have been identified in affected individuals, supporting the gene's role in the etiology of ARNSHI (Liaqat2019Further). TMEM132E is also linked to other nervous system functions, with mutations like the homozygous nonsense mutation Arg420Gln found in patients with hearing loss (LluciàCarol2023Genetic).

Beyond hearing impairment, TMEM132E has been associated with various neurological and psychiatric disorders. Genetic studies have linked it to conditions such as insomnia associated with cardiometabolic diseases, bipolar disorder, and panic disorder (LluciàCarol2023Genetic). Additionally, alterations in miRNA-mRNA interactions involving TMEM132E have been suggested to play a role in metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes and obesity, indicating its potential involvement in these conditions (Gottmann2020Polymorphisms). These findings highlight the gene's broad clinical significance across different physiological systems.
