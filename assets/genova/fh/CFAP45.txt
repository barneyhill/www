# CFAP45

## Overview
The CFAP45 gene encodes the cilia and flagella associated protein 45, a crucial component in the structure and function of motile cilia and flagella. This protein is integral to maintaining axonemal adenine nucleotide homeostasis, which is essential for the proper functioning of dynein ATPases, the motor proteins responsible for generating force along microtubules through ATP hydrolysis. CFAP45 is characterized by a central Trichoplein domain, which facilitates interactions with other proteins, such as AK8, and plays a role in AMP binding, crucial for energy metabolism processes (Dougherty2020CFAP45). The protein's interactions with components of the dynein motor complex and its involvement in nucleotide binding underscore its importance in cellular movement and physiological processes. Mutations in the CFAP45 gene are associated with motile ciliopathies, including situs inversus totalis and asthenospermia, highlighting its clinical significance in reproductive health and respiratory function (Dougherty2020CFAP45).

## Structure
The CFAP45 protein is involved in the structure and function of cilia and flagella, particularly in the context of axonemal adenine nucleotide homeostasis. It is a 551 amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 66 kDa, and it contains a central Trichoplein domain, which is crucial for its function (Dougherty2020CFAP45). This domain is involved in interactions with other proteins, such as AK8, and plays a role in AMP binding, which is essential for its function in energy metabolism processes (Dougherty2020CFAP45).

CFAP45 exhibits a flexible tertiary structure, with long helices and an elbow bend in its N-terminal helix to accommodate interactions with CFAP52, another protein involved in ciliary function (Tai2023Incell). The quaternary structure of CFAP45 involves interactions with CFAP52, which contains two WD40 domains, providing structural support to the B-tubule of sperm microtubule doublets (Tai2023Incell).

The protein has been shown to have splice variant isoforms, including a smaller 223 amino acid isoform identified in mouse tracheal cDNA, which suggests alternative splicing may contribute to tissue-specific functions (Dougherty2020CFAP45). However, detailed information on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of CFAP45 is limited in the available literature.

## Function
The CFAP45 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the function of motile cilia and flagella, which are essential for cellular movement and various physiological processes. In healthy human cells, CFAP45 is involved in maintaining axonemal adenine nucleotide homeostasis, a critical factor for the proper functioning of dynein ATPases. These motor proteins generate force along microtubules through ATP hydrolysis, necessary for the coordinated beating of cilia and flagella (Dougherty2020CFAP45).

CFAP45 interacts with components of the dynein motor complex, such as DNAH11, and is associated with outer dynein arms in the proximal region of respiratory cilia. This interaction is vital for ciliary movement and is maintained even in the absence of outer dynein arms in certain mutant cilia, indicating a specific role in ciliary function (Dougherty2020CFAP45). The protein also binds adenosine monophosphate (AMP), suggesting its involvement in energy metabolism processes, including nucleotide binding and nucleic acid transport (Dougherty2020CFAP45).

CFAP45's role extends to sperm motility, where its deficiency leads to reduced motility and structural abnormalities, highlighting its importance in reproductive health (Dougherty2020CFAP45). The protein's activity is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and function of cilia and flagella, impacting cellular signaling and motility (Dougherty2020CFAP45).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CFAP45 gene are associated with a range of clinical conditions, primarily affecting ciliary and flagellar function. CFAP45 deficiency is linked to motile ciliopathies, which include situs abnormalities such as situs inversus totalis and heterotaxy, as well as asthenospermia, a condition characterized by reduced sperm motility (Dougherty2020CFAP45). In humans, CFAP45 mutations can lead to mild chronic upper respiratory issues and are associated with congenital heart defects and visceral malformations, often requiring surgical intervention (Dougherty2020CFAP45).

In mouse models, CFAP45 deficiency results in a range of phenotypes, including laterality-related abnormalities such as dextrocardia, reversed lung lobation, and abnormal liver lobation, as well as hydrocephalus and reduced body size (Dougherty2020CFAP45). The gene's role in axonemal adenine nucleotide homeostasis is crucial, and its deficiency disrupts this balance, leading to impaired ciliary and flagellar beating (Dougherty2020CFAP45). These disruptions are linked to the improper functioning of cilia and flagella, contributing to the observed clinical manifestations (Dougherty2020CFAP45).

## Interactions
CFAP45, also known as CCDC19 and NESG1, is involved in several interactions crucial for ciliary and flagellar function. It interacts with components of the axonemal dynein complex, including DNAH11 and DNALI1, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid assays (Dougherty2020CFAP45). CFAP45 also shows binary interactions with proteins associated with the basal body/centrosome and intraflagellar transport (Dougherty2020CFAP45).

CFAP45 interacts with CFAP52, another protein involved in ciliary function, as shown by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. This interaction is conserved across species and is important for axonemal adenine nucleotide homeostasis (Dougherty2020CFAP45). Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that CFAP45 can dimerize with adenylate kinase 8 (AK8), potentially acting as an AMP donor to facilitate dynein ATPase-dependent ciliary and flagellar beating (Dougherty2020CFAP45).

CFAP45's role in adenine nucleotide homeostasis is further supported by its ability to bind AMP, particularly when conjugated to agarose resin, indicating a specific interaction with adenine nucleotides (Dougherty2020CFAP45). These interactions are essential for maintaining proper ciliary and flagellar function, as disruptions can lead to motile ciliopathies such as situs inversus totalis and asthenospermia (Dougherty2020CFAP45).
