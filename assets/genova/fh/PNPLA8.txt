# PNPLA8

## Overview
PNPLA8 is a gene that encodes the protein patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 8, also known as calcium-independent phospholipase A2γ (iPLA2γ). This protein is a member of the phospholipase family and plays a critical role in lipid metabolism, particularly within the mitochondrial membrane. It functions as a phospholipase, catalyzing the hydrolysis of phospholipids to release free fatty acids and lysolipids, which are essential for various cellular processes, including signaling, growth, and lipid homeostasis (Saunders2015Loss). PNPLA8 is involved in the regulation of autophagy and mitochondrial function, impacting bioenergetics and signaling pathways. The protein's activity is modulated by divalent cations such as Ca2+ and Mg2+, which activate it to release eicosanoids and lysolipids, crucial for myocardial and mitochondrial functions (Moon2012Activation). Mutations in the PNPLA8 gene have been linked to neurological and mitochondrial disorders, underscoring its significance in maintaining cellular and physiological integrity (Nakamura2023Biallelic).

## Structure
PNPLA8, also known as patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 8, is a membrane protein composed of 782 amino acids. It features both C-terminal and N-terminal domains, akin to other members of the PNPLA family. The patatin domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity, is located in the C-terminal domain between amino acid residues 445-650. This domain includes the catalytic dyad Ser483-Asp627 and contains lipase motifs GVSTG and DGG (Lulić2023The).

The N-terminal domain of PNPLA8 is rich in serine and threonine residues, which are potential sites for phosphorylation by protein kinases, indicating possible post-translational modifications (Lulić2023The). PNPLA8 is predicted to have a FabD/lysophospholipase-like fold, incorporating dual glycine-rich and G-X-S-X-G lipase motifs, along with a catalytic aspartate (Wilson2006Characterization).

PNPLA8 can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may influence its function and localization. A discrete isoform of PNPLA8 has been observed in the mitochondrial compartment of rat myocardium, suggesting a role in linking respiration with mitochondrial thermogenesis (Wilson2006Characterization). However, specific details on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of PNPLA8 are not provided in the available literature.

## Function
PNPLA8, also known as calcium-independent phospholipase A2γ (iPLA2γ), is a crucial enzyme in lipid metabolism, primarily active in the mitochondrial membrane. It catalyzes the hydrolysis of phospholipids, releasing free fatty acids and lysolipids, which are further metabolized into lipid second messengers. These messengers play significant roles in cellular processes such as signaling, growth, and lipid homeostasis (Saunders2015Loss). PNPLA8 is involved in the regulation of autophagy and lipid turnover, particularly in the context of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It inhibits the phosphorylation of ULK1, an autophagy initiator kinase, leading to increased autophagy and facilitating lipid droplet turnover (Kim2016SREBP2PNPLA8).

In healthy cells, PNPLA8 is also linked to mitochondrial function, where it modulates bioenergetics and signaling. It is activated by divalent cations such as Ca2+ and Mg2+, leading to the release of eicosanoids and lysolipids from mitochondrial phospholipids, which are important for myocardial bioenergetic and electrophysiologic functions (Moon2012Activation). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function, impacting processes like apoptosis and inflammation (Saunders2015Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PNPLA8 gene, which encodes calcium-independent phospholipase A2γ (iPLA2γ), are associated with several neurological and mitochondrial disorders. Biallelic null variants in PNPLA8 have been linked to microcephaly, characterized by a reduced abundance of basal radial glia, leading to developmental and epileptic-dyskinetic encephalopathy (DEDE) and congenital microcephaly (Nakamura2023Biallelic). These variants result in impaired phospholipid regulation, affecting brain development and function (Nakamura2023Biallelic).

In addition to microcephaly, PNPLA8 mutations are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, contributing to neurodegenerative diseases. The absence of iPLA2γ leads to significant changes in hippocampal lipid metabolism, mitochondrial degeneration, and cognitive dysfunction, as observed in both human cases and mouse models (Saunders2015Loss; Mancuso2009Genetic). These mitochondrial abnormalities are linked to increased oxidative stress and altered phospholipid metabolism, which are common features in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases (Mancuso2009Genetic).

Furthermore, PNPLA8 mutations have been implicated in optic atrophy and non-syndromic hearing loss, highlighting the gene's role in various sensory and neurological disorders (Nakamura2023Biallelic).

## Interactions
PNPLA8, also known as calcium-independent phospholipase A2γ (iPLA2γ), is involved in several protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. PNPLA8 dynamically interacts with LC3, a protein associated with autophagosomes, suggesting a regulatory mechanism for lipid homeostasis through autophagy (Kim2016SREBP2PNPLA8). This interaction is crucial for the regulation of autophagy, as PNPLA8 overexpression inhibits ULK-1 phosphorylation, thereby increasing autophagy initiation (Kim2016SREBP2PNPLA8).

PNPLA8 also interacts with mitochondrial membranes, where it plays a role in lipid metabolism and mitochondrial function. It is involved in the hydrolytic cleavage of membrane glycerophospholipids, releasing arachidonic acid and producing eicosanoids and lysolipids, which are important for mitochondrial bioenergetics and signaling (Kunz2016Confirmation). The enzyme's activity is modulated by divalent cations such as Ca2+ and Mg2+, which activate PNPLA8 to release eicosanoids and lysolipids from mitochondrial phospholipids (Moon2012Activation).

These interactions highlight PNPLA8's role in lipid metabolism, autophagy, and mitochondrial function, contributing to its involvement in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and apoptosis.
