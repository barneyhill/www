# BUB3

## Overview
BUB3 is a gene that encodes the BUB3 mitotic checkpoint protein, a pivotal component of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) mechanism. This protein is categorized as a WD40 repeat protein, characterized by its seven-bladed beta-propeller structure, which facilitates protein-protein interactions essential for its function in mitosis (Wilson2005The; Larsen2004Crystal). BUB3 plays a critical role in ensuring accurate chromosome segregation by forming part of the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), which inhibits the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) until all chromosomes are correctly attached to spindle microtubules (Silva2022BUB3; Prinz2016Functional). The protein's interactions with other checkpoint proteins, such as BUB1 and BUBR1, are crucial for maintaining genomic stability and preventing aneuploidy, thereby underscoring its importance in cell cycle regulation and its potential implications in cancer and aging (Silva2022BUB3; Logarinho2008The).

## Structure
The BUB3 mitotic checkpoint protein is characterized by a seven-bladed beta-propeller structure, typical of WD40 repeat proteins. Each blade of the propeller consists of four anti-parallel beta-strands, contributing to the protein's pseudo-sevenfold rotational symmetry around a central axis (Wilson2005The; Larsen2004Crystal). The WD40 repeats in BUB3 are involved in protein-protein interactions, particularly at the top surface of the propeller, where loops connecting the D and A strands and the B and C strands are located (Wilson2005The). 

BUB3 interacts with other spindle checkpoint proteins, such as BUB1 and BUBR1, through specific motifs like the GLEBS motif, which undergoes a structural transition upon binding to BUB3 (Larsen2007Structural). The interaction with these proteins is crucial for the stability of the mitotic checkpoint complex (Prinz2016Functional). 

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are common in BUB3, although specific sites and their physiological relevance are not fully detailed (Wilson2005The). The protein's structure and interactions are conserved across species, highlighting its fundamental role in the spindle assembly checkpoint (Prinz2016Functional).

## Function
BUB3 is a crucial component of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), a mechanism that ensures accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis. It functions as a scaffolding protein, forming part of the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) along with BUBR1 and MAD2, which inhibits the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) until all chromosomes are properly attached to the spindle microtubules (Silva2022BUB3; Prinz2016Functional). BUB3 is primarily active at kinetochores, where it binds to phosphorylated MELT repeats on the outer kinetochore subunit Knl1, facilitating the recruitment of BUB1 and BUBR1 to kinetochores (Silva2022BUB3; Logarinho2008The).

This interaction is essential for the integrity of the SAC, as it helps establish correct kinetochore-microtubule (K-MT) attachments, ensuring that chromosomes are aligned and under appropriate tension before anaphase onset (Toledo2014BuGZ; Logarinho2008The). BUB3's role in stabilizing these attachments is critical for maintaining genomic stability, preventing aneuploidy, and ensuring proper cell cycle progression (Prinz2016Functional; Logarinho2008The). Its deficiency can lead to chromosome misalignment and instability, highlighting its importance in cell division (Logarinho2008The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the BUB3 gene, including its overexpression and mutations, have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer and aging. BUB3 is frequently overexpressed in various human cancers, such as oral squamous cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, gastric cancer, sarcomas, hepatocellular carcinoma, and breast cancer. This overexpression is often associated with poor prognosis, although in some cases, like low-grade breast cancers, high BUB3 expression correlates with longer survival (Silva2022BUB3). In TP53-mutant cancers, BUB3 levels are higher compared to TP53-wild-type cancers, suggesting that TP53 may normally repress BUB3 expression, implicating the TP53-BUB3 pathway in carcinogenesis (Silva2022BUB3).

Polymorphisms in the BUB3 gene are linked to poor survival outcomes in early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (Silva2022BUB3). Despite its frequent overexpression, mutations in BUB3 are rare and do not significantly increase cancer risk (Silva2022BUB3). The gene's role in spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) regulation is crucial, and its disruption can lead to chromosomal instability and aneuploidy, contributing to tumorigenesis (Silva2022BUB3). Haploinsufficiency of BUB3 in mice results in severe chromosomal instability and accelerated aging, characterized by early onset of cellular senescence (Silva2022BUB3).

## Interactions
BUB3 is a crucial component of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) and interacts with several proteins to ensure proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. It forms stable complexes with BUBR1 and BUB1, both of which contain a Gle2-binding-sequence (GLEBS) motif necessary for interaction with BUB3. This interaction is mediated by the GLEBS motif, which undergoes a conformational change upon binding to BUB3, transitioning from an unfolded to a well-defined structure (Larsen2007Structural; Prinz2016Functional). The interaction between BUB3 and BUBR1 is characterized by high affinity and long-lasting binding, with the GLEBS motif forming an extensive interface with BUB3's β-propeller structure (Prinz2016Functional).

BUB3 also plays a role in the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), which includes BUBR1, MAD2, and CDC20, acting as an inhibitor of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) until proper kinetochore attachment is achieved (Larsen2007Structural). The interaction with BUBR1 is not solely dependent on electrostatic interactions but also involves adjacent N- and C-terminal residues that contribute to the high affinity and long half-life of the complex (Prinz2016Functional). These interactions are essential for the localization of BUB1 and BUBR1 to unattached kinetochores, playing a critical role in SAC signaling (Logarinho2008The).
