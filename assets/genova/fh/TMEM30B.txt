# TMEM30B

## Overview
TMEM30B is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 30B, also known as CDC50B, which is a crucial component of cellular membranes. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it plays a significant role in phospholipid transport. TMEM30B functions as a phospholipid flippase, facilitating the movement of phospholipids across the lipid bilayer, which is essential for maintaining membrane asymmetry and is involved in various cellular processes such as vesicle formation, cell signaling, and apoptosis. The protein interacts with P4-ATPases, such as ATP8B1 and ATP8B2, and is implicated in the regulation of proinflammatory cytokines and signaling pathways, including MAP kinase and NF-κB activation. TMEM30B's expression is regulated by the transcription factor CREB3L1, and its dysregulation has been associated with several cancers, including clear cell renal cell carcinoma and high-grade serous ovarian cancers, highlighting its potential role in cancer biology and as a prognostic marker (Li2024CREB3L1; Wesoly2024Structural).

## Structure
TMEM30B, also known as CDC50B, is a transmembrane protein localized in the endoplasmic reticulum with both its N- and C-termini facing the cytoplasm (Wesoly2024Structural). The full-length protein consists of 351 amino acids, but alternative splicing results in multiple mRNA isoforms, such as TMEM30B_201 and TMEM30B_203, which do not contain an open reading frame and are not translated (Wesoly2024Structural). 

The protein is associated with P4-ATPases and functions as a phospholipid flippase, which is essential for the ER exit of these ATPases (Wesoly2024Structural). TMEM30B co-immunoprecipitates with ATP8B1 and ATP8B2, indicating a role in regulating proinflammatory cytokines and signaling pathways (Wesoly2024Structural). 

A specific mutation in TMEM30B, an A/C substitution at chromosome 14, position 61747114, results in the replacement of valine by glycine in the helical part of the exoplasmic loop, potentially affecting protein stability (Wesoly2024Structural). Despite these insights, the detailed secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of TMEM30B have not been experimentally verified, and further studies are needed to elucidate its complete molecular architecture (Wesoly2024Structural).

## Function
TMEM30B, also known as CDC50B, is a transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of phospholipid transport across cellular membranes. It functions as a phospholipid flippase, facilitating the movement of phospholipids from the outer to the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer, which is essential for maintaining membrane asymmetry. This activity is important for processes such as vesicle formation, cell signaling, and apoptosis (Wesoly2024Structural).

TMEM30B is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it is involved in the ER exit of P4-ATPases, a family of proteins crucial for various cellular processes, including the regulation of proinflammatory cytokines, MAP kinase signaling, and NF-κB activation (Wesoly2024Structural). The protein's termini face the cytoplasm, indicating its orientation and potential interactions within the cell (Wesoly2024Structural).

In healthy human cells, TMEM30B is involved in transcription regulation and metabolic processes, as evidenced by its association with the deregulation of genes involved in these pathways when overexpressed (Wesoly2024Structural). Its role in these processes suggests a significant impact on cell biology and organismal outcomes, particularly in the context of diseases such as clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) (Wesoly2024Structural).

## Clinical Significance
TMEM30B has been implicated in various cancers, particularly clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and high-grade serous ovarian cancers. In ccRCC, TMEM30B is significantly downregulated, with its expression levels correlating with clinical parameters such as Fuhrman grade and overall survival. This downregulation is associated with potentially damaging mutations and deletions in its locus, suggesting a role in carcinogenesis processes like cell adhesion and regulation of epithelial cell proliferation (Wesoly2024Structural). Overexpression studies have shown that TMEM30B can lead to deregulation of genes involved in transcription regulation and biosynthesis, including transcription factors such as ZNF, IRF, SOX, and HOX genes, which are linked to cancer progression (Wesoly2024Structural).

TMEM30B has also been associated with worse overall survival in patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancers, indicating its potential role as a prognostic marker (Wesoly2024Structural). The gene's involvement in the regulation of proinflammatory cytokines, MAP kinase signaling, and NF-κB activation further supports its significance in cancer biology (Wesoly2024Structural). Despite these associations, the exact mechanisms by which TMEM30B contributes to these diseases require further investigation.

## Interactions
TMEM30B, also known as CDC50B, is a transmembrane protein that interacts with P4-ATPases, specifically ATP8B1 and ATP8B2, through co-immunoprecipitation. This interaction suggests a role in the regulation of proinflammatory cytokines, MAP kinase signaling, and NF-κB activation (Wesoly2024Structural). TMEM30B is also identified as a direct transcriptional target of the transcription factor CREB3L1. In CREB3L1-deficient odontoblasts, TMEM30B expression is significantly reduced, indicating that CREB3L1 positively regulates TMEM30B expression (Li2024CREB3L1). 

TMEM30B is involved in protein transport and secretion, and its deficiency impairs odontoblastic differentiation by reducing intracellular and extracellular protein levels. Overexpression of TMEM30B in CREB3L1-deficient mouse dental papilla cells partially restores extracellular protein secretion, highlighting its role in protein export (Li2024CREB3L1). The interaction between TMEM30B and CREB3L1 suggests a complex regulatory mechanism in odontoblastic differentiation, where TMEM30B acts as a crucial component in the protein secretion pathway (Li2024CREB3L1). These interactions underline TMEM30B's involvement in cellular processes related to protein transport and signal transduction.
