# IFT43

## Overview
IFT43 is a gene that encodes the intraflagellar transport 43 protein, a crucial component of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system, specifically within the IFT-A complex. This protein plays a vital role in ciliogenesis, the process by which cilia are formed, and is essential for the maintenance and function of cilia in human cells. As a part of the IFT-A complex, IFT43 is involved in the bidirectional transport of ciliary proteins, facilitating both retrograde and anterograde movement along ciliary microtubules. The protein is characterized by a largely disordered structure with a conserved domain, and it interacts with other IFT-A components such as IFT121 and IFT122 to ensure the stability and integrity of the complex. Mutations in the IFT43 gene have been linked to various ciliopathies, including non-syndromic recessive retinal degeneration and syndromic conditions like Sensenbrenner syndrome and short rib polydactyly syndrome, underscoring its critical role in ciliary function and human health (Arts2011C14ORF179; Zhu2017Functional; Biswas2017A).

## Structure
IFT43 is a component of the IFT-A complex, which is crucial for intraflagellar transport and ciliogenesis. It is the smallest protein in the IFT-A complex and is characterized by a relatively large conserved amino acid sequence known as the IFT43 conserved domain (Taschner2012Architecture; Zhu2017Functional). Despite its importance, IFT43 does not contain any clearly identifiable domains apart from a short central coiled-coil region predicted with low probability (Taschner2012Architecture). 

The protein is largely disordered, with its structure modeled using helices as rigid bodies and the rest represented by flexible beads, indicating a disordered structure (McCafferty2022Integrative). IFT43 interacts directly with IFT121 and is essential for the stability of the IFT-A complex, playing a unique role in protecting the complex from protein degradation (Zhu2017Functional). 

IFT43's interaction with other IFT-A components, such as IFT121 and IFT122, suggests its involvement in the organization and stability of the complex (McCafferty2022Integrative). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, as well as post-translational modifications, are not provided in the available literature.

## Function
IFT43 is a component of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system, specifically associated with the IFT-A complex, which is crucial for ciliogenesis and the maintenance of cilia in human cells. It plays a significant role in the bidirectional transport of ciliary proteins, facilitating both retrograde and anterograde movement along ciliary microtubules, which is essential for cilia function (Zhu2017Functional). IFT43 is involved in the transport of ciliary precursors from the cytoplasmic pool to the flagellar base, a process that involves cytoplasmic dynein, a motor protein that facilitates transport along microtubules (Zhu2017Functional).

In healthy cells, IFT43 is crucial for the stability and proper localization of the IFT-A complex. It helps prevent the degradation of IFT-A components, maintaining their cellular levels and ensuring the integrity of the complex (Zhu2017Functional). The protein is active in the cell body, where it regulates the transport of ciliary precursors, and its absence can lead to defects in cilia formation, resulting in cells that are either aflagellate or have short flagella with bulges (Zhu2017Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IFT43 gene are associated with several ciliopathies, which are disorders caused by ciliary dysfunction. One significant condition linked to IFT43 mutations is non-syndromic recessive retinal degeneration, specifically severe early childhood onset retinal dystrophy or early onset retinitis pigmentosa. A novel homozygous mutation, p.Glu34Lys, was identified in a Pakistani family, which segregates with this retinal degeneration phenotype. This mutation is rare and predicted to be damaging, leading to disrupted intraflagellar transport and ciliogenesis, resulting in shorter cilia (Biswas2017A).

IFT43 mutations are also implicated in syndromic conditions such as Sensenbrenner syndrome and short rib polydactyly syndrome (SRPS). In Sensenbrenner syndrome, mutations in IFT43 disrupt ciliary transport, leading to skeletal and ectodermal anomalies, chronic renal failure, and other systemic issues (Arts2011C14ORF179). In SRPS, mutations result in skeletal abnormalities, including short ribs and polydactyly, due to disrupted ciliogenesis and cartilage growth plate architecture (Duran2017Mutations). These findings highlight the diverse clinical manifestations resulting from IFT43 mutations, reflecting its critical role in ciliary function.

## Interactions
IFT43 is a component of the intraflagellar transport A (IFT-A) complex, which is crucial for retrograde transport within cilia. It interacts directly with IFT121 (WDR35), another member of the IFT-A complex, forming a dimer that is essential for the stability and function of the complex (Arts2011C14ORF179; Duran2017Mutations). This interaction is significant because IFT121 is involved in cilium assembly and the organization of centriolar satellites, and its mutations can destabilize IFT43, leading to its abnormal localization to the cytosol (Duran2017Mutations).

IFT43 is also part of a peripheral subcomplex within the IFT-A complex, which includes IFT121 and IFT139. The interaction between IFT43 and IFT122, a core component of the IFT-A complex, is mediated through the IFT43-IFT121 dimer. Mutations in IFT122 can impair its interaction with the IFT43-IFT121 dimer, affecting the overall function of the IFT-A complex (Takahara2017Ciliopathy-associated).

While IFT43 does not have motifs predicted with high probability for protein-protein interactions, its role in the IFT-A complex suggests it may facilitate binding to cargo and motor proteins, as well as to the IFT-B subcomplex (Taschner2012Architecture).
