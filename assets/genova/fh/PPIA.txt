# PPIA

## Overview
PPIA is a gene that encodes the protein peptidylprolyl isomerase A, commonly referred to as cyclophilin A. This protein is a member of the cyclophilin family and functions as a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase, which plays a critical role in protein folding by catalyzing the cis-trans isomerization of proline residues. Cyclophilin A is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, protein trafficking, and immune response, and is known for its interaction with several proteins, such as the HIV capsid protein, influencing viral infectivity (Dunyak2016PeptidylProline; Nath2015Insights). The protein's structure is characterized by a central closed barrel type beta fold, which is typical of cyclophilins, and includes a cyclophilin domain that is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Rajiv2018Structural; Davis2010Structural). Cyclophilin A's involvement in both intracellular and extracellular functions highlights its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental stress (Dunyak2016PeptidylProline).

## Structure
The PPIA gene encodes the protein peptidylprolyl isomerase A, also known as cyclophilin A, which is involved in protein folding. The primary structure of PPIA consists of a single polypeptide chain. Its secondary structure is characterized by a central closed barrel type beta fold, which includes large regions of ordered loops and two small helices packed against the loop region and sheets β7-β8 of the central barrel (Rajiv2018Structural). The tertiary structure forms a barrel-like shape typical of cyclophilins, with eight antiparallel beta sheets and two alpha-helices (Davis2010Structural). 

The active site of PPIA includes an invariant catalytic arginine (Arg55) and a conserved mixture of hydrophobic, aromatic, and polar residues, such as Trp121, which is crucial for cyclosporin binding (Davis2010Structural). The protein also features a cyclophilin domain and is subject to post-translational modifications like phosphorylation. PPIA can form quaternary structures by interacting with other proteins, and splice variants may exist, leading to different isoforms (Davis2010Structural). The S1 pocket residues are largely invariant across the nuclear cyclophilin family, while the S2 pocket residues are more variable, contributing to substrate specificity (Rajiv2018Structural).

## Function
PPIA, also known as cyclophilin A, is a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase that plays a crucial role in protein folding by catalyzing the cis-trans isomerization of proline residues in proteins. This enzymatic activity is essential for the regulation of protein dimerization, stability, localization, and function, impacting various cellular processes such as signal transduction, protein trafficking, and immune response (Dunyak2016PeptidylProline; Nath2015Insights).

In healthy human cells, PPIA is predominantly located in the cytoplasm and is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental stress. It interacts with several proteins, including the receptor tyrosine kinase Itk, modulating its activity post-translationally, and the HIV capsid protein Gag, affecting HIV infectivity (Davis2010Structural). PPIA also plays a role in immune cell function, influencing leukocyte trafficking and neutrophil migration by acting as a chemotactic agent (Nath2015Insights).

The protein's activity is not limited to intracellular functions; it can also act extracellularly, potentially serving as a growth factor in response to oxidative stress (Dunyak2016PeptidylProline). PPIA's involvement in these diverse processes underscores its importance in cellular function and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the PPIA gene, which encodes the cyclophilin A protein, have been implicated in several diseases, including HIV-1 infection and cancer. In the context of HIV-1, specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the PPIA gene, such as SNP3 and SNP4, are associated with rapid disease progression. These SNPs affect the binding efficiency of transcription factors, potentially altering PPIA expression and accelerating the depletion of CD4+ T cells, leading to faster progression to AIDS (An2007Regulatory).

In cancer, PPIA plays a significant role in the stability and function of the NRF2 protein, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PPIA stabilizes NRF2, preventing its degradation and promoting cancer cell proliferation. This interaction is crucial for maintaining NRF2's function, and its disruption can impair cancer cell growth. Targeting PPIA with drugs like cyclosporin A has shown potential in reducing NRF2 stability and inhibiting cancer progression (Lu2024PPIA).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PPIA is involved in tumor immunity and mRNA metabolism. Its expression is associated with poor prognosis, and it may serve as a biomarker for disease progression (Mou2022Clinical; Gu2021A).

## Interactions
Peptidylprolyl isomerase A (PPIA), also known as cyclophilin A, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its biological functions. PPIA interacts with TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TARDBP), a member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family, which is significant for mRNA processing and splicing. This interaction is influenced by the presence of RNA and PPIA's enzymatic activity, and is enhanced by Lys-acetylation (Lauranzano2015Peptidylprolyl). In the context of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the interaction between PPIA and TARDBP is impaired, leading to TARDBP aggregation and mislocalization (Lauranzano2015Peptidylprolyl).

PPIA also interacts with CD147, a transmembrane protein, in a manner that is primarily determined by heparans on cell surfaces. This interaction is of low affinity and may be transitory, similar to enzyme-substrate interactions (Yurchenko2002Active). Additionally, PPIA is known to interact with viral proteins, such as the HIV-1 capsid protein, facilitating steps in the viral life cycle, and with hepatitis C virus non-structural proteins NS5A and NS5B, enhancing viral replication (Nigro2013Cyclophilin).
