# SMTN

## Overview
The SMTN gene encodes the protein smoothelin, a cytoskeletal protein predominantly expressed in smooth muscle cells. Smoothelin is integral to the contractile apparatus of these cells, playing a crucial role in maintaining their contractile phenotype and structural integrity. It is characterized by domains that facilitate actin binding, including a calponin homology domain and an actinin-type actin-binding domain, which are essential for its function in stabilizing actin filaments and enhancing the actin-cross-linking activity of filamin A (FLNA) (Krämer1999A; Eys1997Smoothelin). The protein exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with tissue-specific expression patterns that contribute to its functional diversity (Krämer1999A; Krämer2001Identification). Smoothelin's interaction with FLNA is critical for mechanotransduction, influencing the mechanical properties of the cytoskeleton in response to mechanical stress (Wang2019Identification). Alterations in SMTN expression or function are associated with various cardiovascular and vascular conditions, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining vascular stability and function (Wang2019Identification).

## Structure
Smoothelin (SMTN) is a cytoskeletal protein specifically expressed in smooth muscle cells, characterized by a primary structure rich in serine and proline residues. The protein includes a calponin homology domain, which is involved in actin binding and is crucial for its role in the contractile apparatus of smooth muscle cells (Krämer1999A; Eys1997Smoothelin). Smoothelin is subject to phosphorylation, a common post-translational modification that may influence its function and interaction with other proteins (Eys1997Smoothelin).

The secondary structure of smoothelin includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its stability and function within the cytoskeleton (Eys1997Smoothelin). Smoothelin exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which results in different molecular weights and tissue-specific expression patterns. The large isoform, approximately 100 kDa, is predominantly expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells, while the smaller isoform, around 59 kDa, is found in visceral smooth muscle tissues (Krämer1999A; Krämer2001Identification).

The protein also contains an actinin-type actin-binding domain, which is highly conserved between species, indicating its essential role in smooth muscle cell function (Krämer1999A). The presence of multiple splice variants, such as c1, c2, and c3, further contributes to the functional diversity of smoothelin, allowing it to modulate the contractile properties of different smooth muscle cell types (Krämer2001Identification).

## Function
Smoothelin (SMTN) is a cytoskeletal protein that plays a critical role in maintaining the contractile phenotype of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in human blood vessels. It is primarily expressed in differentiated, contractile SMCs and is absent in synthetic-type SMCs, which are involved in producing extracellular matrix components (van1997Differentiation). Smoothelin contributes to the structural integrity of the cytoskeleton by stabilizing actin filaments, enhancing the actin-cross-linking activity of filamin A (FLNA), and reinforcing the mechanical properties of the FLNA-actin networks in a force-dependent manner (Wang2019Identification).

In vascular contexts, smoothelin is involved in the contractile activity of SMCs, which is essential for regulating blood pressure and flow. It is expressed in the SMCs of large arteries and veins, correlating with isometric contractile activity, and is absent in small veins that do not generate contractions (van1997Differentiation). Smoothelin's interaction with FLNA is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the cytoskeleton in response to mechanical stress, which is important for the proper function of vascular and visceral smooth muscles (Wang2019Identification). The presence of smoothelin in SMCs is indicative of their contractile potential and structural integrity, contributing to the overall function of blood vessels (van1997Differentiation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the SMTN gene have been linked to several cardiovascular and vascular conditions. In humans, the SMTN gene is associated with essential hypertension, cerebral infarction, and myocardial infarction. A loss of SMTN B expression leads to the disappearance of the contractile vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) phenotype, which is implicated in various vascular disorders (Wang2019Identification). In mice, the absence of both SMTN A and SMTN B is lethal at a young age, and SMTN B deficiency results in decreased contractile potential of smooth muscle cells, hypertension, and cardiac hypertrophy (Wang2019Identification).

The interaction between SMTN and filamin A (FLNA) is crucial for cellular mechanics, and disruptions in this interaction can affect smooth muscle function and blood pressure regulation (Wang2019Identification). SMTN B enhances the actin-cross-linking activity of FLNA, reinforcing the mechanics of the actin cytoskeleton, which is vital for maintaining vascular stability (Wang2019Identification). Alterations in SMTN expression or its interaction with FLNA may contribute to the pathophysiology of vascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis, due to its role in maintaining VSMC contractility and stability.

## Interactions
Smoothelin (SMTN) is known to interact with filamin A (FLNA), particularly with its mechanosensitive domains R21 and R23. This interaction is force-dependent and plays a role in mechanotransduction, the process by which cells convert mechanical stimuli into biochemical signals. SMTN specifically binds to the open domain of R21 in FLNA, as demonstrated by co-expression experiments in HEK-293 cells. The interaction was confirmed through immunoprecipitation and Western blotting, showing SMTN's binding to a FLAG-tagged FLNA construct (Wang2019Identification).

The interaction between SMTN and FLNA is suggested to be constitutive with FLNAvar-1 and force-dependent with canonical FLNA. SMTN enhances the actin-cross-linking activity of FLNAvar-1, reinforcing the mechanics of the actin cytoskeleton in a force-dependent manner (Wang2019Identification). SMTN B isoform directly binds to F-actin with a binding affinity of 0.54 μM and enhances FLNA's F-actin gelation activity. This interaction is myosin-dependent, stabilizing SMTN B on the actin cytoskeleton (Wang2019Identification).

The study also suggests that SMTN interacts with the CD cleft of R21 similarly to other proteins like β-integrin, migfilin, and CFTR, although further studies are needed to fully understand the interaction of the full-length SMTN molecule (Wang2019Identification).
