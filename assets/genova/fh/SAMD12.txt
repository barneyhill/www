# SAMD12

## Overview
Sterile alpha motif domain containing 12 (SAMD12) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal dynamics and cell migration. The protein, also named SAMD12, contains a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, which is known for mediating protein-protein interactions. SAMD12 interacts with CNK2, a scaffold protein, to regulate ARF6 activation, influencing cancer cell motility and metastasis (Serwe2023CNK2). In addition to its role in cancer biology, SAMD12 is implicated in neurological disorders such as familial cortical myoclonic tremor with epilepsy (FCMTE) and benign adult familial myoclonic epilepsy (BAFME), where repeat expansions in the gene are pathogenic (Lei2018TTTCA; Zhou2021Clinical). The gene's involvement in both oncological and neurological contexts underscores its significance in human health and disease (Yeetong2020Founder; Hu2023Liver).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SAMD12 gene are associated with several neurological disorders, most notably familial cortical myoclonic tremor with epilepsy (FCMTE) and benign adult familial myoclonic epilepsy (BAFME). FCMTE is characterized by adult-onset cortical myoclonic tremor and seizures, with studies identifying expansions of TTTTA and TTTCA repeat motifs in intron 4 of the SAMD12 gene as the causative mutation (Lei2018TTTCA; Zhou2021Clinical). These repeat expansions are known to exhibit somatic and intergenerational instability, contributing to the disease's progression and variability in clinical presentation (Zhou2021Clinical).

BAFME, another condition linked to SAMD12 mutations, is marked by tremulous myoclonus and infrequent generalized epileptic seizures. The disorder is associated with TTTCA repeat expansions in the SAMD12 gene, which have been identified in various populations, including Japanese, Chinese, and Thai families, suggesting a common ancestral origin (Yeetong2020Founder; Mizuguchi2018Detecting). The pathogenic mechanism of these repeat expansions is thought to involve RNA-mediated toxicity, similar to other neurodegenerative diseases (Lei2018TTTCA). Despite the identification of these genetic mutations, the precise role of SAMD12 in cellular processes remains unclear, and further research is needed to elucidate its function and the full spectrum of its clinical implications (Zhou2021Clinical).

## Interactions
SAMD12 is involved in several protein-protein interactions that play a crucial role in cellular processes. It interacts with CNK2, a scaffold protein that promotes cancer cell motility by mediating ARF6 activation. This interaction is essential for the regulation of cell migration and metastasis, as CNK2 and SAMD12 together facilitate the activation of ARF6, which is upstream of the RAC1 and RHOA GTPases involved in cytoskeletal dynamics (Serwe2023CNK2). SAMD12 is suggested to stabilize the CNK2-cytohesin complex, promoting ARF6 activity, although the exact mechanism remains unclear (Serwe2023CNK2).

In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SAMD12 is targeted by miR-106a-5p, a microRNA associated with liver fibrosis. The downregulation of SAMD12 in HCC suggests its involvement in the disease's pathogenesis, potentially acting as a tumor suppressor (Hu2023Liver). Additionally, a fusion between SAMD12 and EXT1 has been identified in a patient with multiple exostoses, indicating a potential role in hereditary conditions (Oliver2019A). These interactions highlight SAMD12's involvement in both cancer progression and genetic disorders.
