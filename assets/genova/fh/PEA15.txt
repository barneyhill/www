# PEA15

## Overview
PEA15, or Proliferation and Apoptosis Adaptor Protein 15, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional regulatory protein involved in critical cellular processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, and glucose metabolism. The protein encoded by PEA15 is characterized by a death effector domain (DED), which facilitates its interactions with other proteins, notably within the ERK1/2 MAP kinase pathway. This interaction is crucial for the protein's role in sequestering ERK1/2 in the cytoplasm, thereby inhibiting ERK-dependent transcription and cell proliferation (Formstecher2001PEA15; Fiory2009Frontiers:). Additionally, PEA15 modulates apoptotic pathways by interacting with death domain-containing proteins, such as FADD, to inhibit apoptosis (Renault2003The; Kitsberg1999KnockOut). The protein's function is further regulated by phosphorylation at specific serine residues, which influences its stability and interaction capabilities (Wei2015On; Fiory2009Frontiers:). PEA15's involvement in various signaling pathways underscores its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states, including cancer and neurological disorders.

## Structure
PEA15, also known as Proliferation and Apoptosis Adaptor Protein 15, is characterized by a death effector domain (DED) that is crucial for its role in protein-protein interactions. The DED of PEA15 is a canonical six-helix bundle structure, which is typical for proteins in this family (CrespoFlores2019PEA15; Twomey2012Highdefinition). The protein also features an irregularly structured C-terminal tail, which acts as an allosteric modulator, influencing the conformation of the DED and facilitating interactions with other proteins (CrespoFlores2019PEA15).

Upon binding with extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2), PEA15 undergoes significant conformational changes, particularly in helices α2, α3, and α4, while helices α1, α5, and α6 remain relatively unchanged (CrespoFlores2019PEA15). The C-terminal tail becomes more rigid upon ERK2 binding, and the DED exhibits increased flexibility (CrespoFlores2019PEA15).

PEA15 is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation at serine residues S104 and S116, which alter its conformation and affect its binding preferences, including interactions with FADD and ERK2 (CrespoFlores2019PEA15). These modifications play a critical role in regulating PEA15's function in cellular processes like apoptosis and proliferation (CrespoFlores2019PEA15).

## Function
PEA15 (Proliferation and Apoptosis Adaptor Protein 15) is a multifunctional protein that plays a significant role in regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, and glucose metabolism. In healthy human cells, PEA15 primarily functions by interacting with the ERK1/2 MAP kinase pathway. It sequesters ERK1/2 in the cytoplasm, preventing their translocation to the nucleus, which in turn inhibits ERK-dependent transcription and cell proliferation (Formstecher2001PEA15; Fiory2009Frontiers:). This cytoplasmic retention of ERK1/2 is crucial for controlling cellular growth and gene transcription.

PEA15 also plays a protective role against apoptosis by interacting with death domain-containing proteins such as FADD and caspase-8, thereby inhibiting the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) and blocking caspase activation (Renault2003The; Kitsberg1999KnockOut). This anti-apoptotic function is particularly important in astrocytes, where PEA15 helps protect against cytokine-induced apoptosis (Kitsberg1999KnockOut).

The protein is phosphorylated at two serine residues, Ser104 and Ser116, by protein kinase C (PKC) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), which modulates its stability and function (Kitsberg1999KnockOut; Fiory2009Frontiers:). PEA15's phosphorylation state influences its ability to regulate ERK1/2 activity and its involvement in apoptotic pathways (Wei2015On).

## Clinical Significance
PEA15 is implicated in various diseases due to mutations, altered expression levels, or changes in its interactions. In cancer, PEA15 expression is often dysregulated, with increased levels observed in tumors such as gliomas, ovarian, kidney, and hepatocellular carcinomas, lymphomas, and melanomas. In breast cancer, PEA15 mRNA levels are higher in cancerous cells compared to normal mammary epithelial cells, suggesting a role in oncogenesis (Renault2003The). In ovarian cancer, high PEA15 expression correlates with longer overall survival, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Bartholomeusz2008PEA15). 

In neuroblastoma, PEA15 acts as a metastasis suppressor, with high expression levels associated with favorable prognosis and reduced metastasis (Gawecka2012PEA15). In colorectal cancer, PEA15 expression is linked to better prognosis and lower invasiveness, contrasting its pro-proliferative role in glioblastomas (Funke2013The).

PEA15 also plays a role in neurological disorders. In domestic cats, a pathogenic variant in PEA15 leads to cerebral dysgenesis, highlighting its importance in brain development (Graff2020PEA15). In diabetes, PEA15 overexpression is linked to impaired insulin action and secretion (Fiory2009Frontiers:). These findings underscore the clinical significance of PEA15 in various diseases.

## Interactions
PEA15 interacts with several proteins, notably ERK1/2 and FADD, influencing various cellular processes. PEA15 binds to ERK1/2, preventing their nuclear translocation and thereby regulating ERK-dependent transcription and cell proliferation (Formstecher2001PEA15; Renganathan2005Phosphorylation). This interaction is facilitated by the death effector domain (DED) and the C-terminal tail of PEA15, which are crucial for binding to ERK2 (Hill2002Recognition). PEA15 can bind both active and inactive forms of ERK, and its phosphorylation state modulates this interaction. Phosphorylation at Ser-104 by PKCα or CamKII disrupts ERK binding, allowing ERK to translocate to the nucleus, while phosphorylation at Ser-116 does not affect ERK binding (Renganathan2005Phosphorylation).

PEA15 also interacts with FADD, a proapoptotic protein, through its DED. This interaction inhibits apoptosis by blocking caspase recruitment. The binding specificity to FADD is enhanced by phosphorylation at Ser-116, which is necessary for PEA15's recruitment to the death-initiation signaling complex (DISC) (Renganathan2005Phosphorylation; Ikedife2022PEA15). These interactions highlight PEA15's role as a regulatory protein, modulating cellular signaling pathways through phosphorylation-dependent protein-protein interactions.
