# ESYT3

## Overview
The ESYT3 gene encodes the extended synaptotagmin 3 protein, which is a member of the extended synaptotagmin family. This protein is characterized by its involvement in membrane contact sites and lipid transfer, playing a crucial role in cellular processes such as membrane trafficking and signaling. ESYT3 contains multiple C2 domains, which are calcium-binding motifs, and a synaptotagmin-like mitochondrial lipid-binding protein (SMP) domain, both of which are essential for its function in lipid homeostasis and organelle biogenesis (Nath2019Extended; Zhang2020Hypothalamic). The protein is particularly significant in adipocytes, where it facilitates lipid droplet biogenesis and growth, and in Leydig cells, where it is involved in lipid transport (Jauregui2018Leydig; Lalioti2020The). Additionally, ESYT3 interacts with the STING protein, influencing the DNA damage response pathway in lung adenocarcinoma cells, thereby highlighting its potential role in cancer biology (Luo2024Overexpression). The gene's expression is also linked to metabolic disorders and obesity, underscoring its clinical significance in both metabolic and oncological contexts (Luo2024Overexpression; Zhang2020Hypothalamic).

## Structure
The extended synaptotagmin 3 (ESYT3) protein is part of the extended synaptotagmin family, characterized by its involvement in membrane contact sites and lipid transfer. ESYT3 contains multiple C2 domains, which are calcium-binding motifs, and a synaptotagmin-like mitochondrial lipid-binding protein (SMP) domain. These domains are crucial for its role in cellular processes such as membrane trafficking and signaling (Zhang2020Hypothalamic).

The C2 domains in ESYT3 are known for their ability to bind acidic phospholipids, which facilitates interactions with the plasma membrane. This binding is typically calcium-dependent, allowing the protein to function as a sensor and mediator in various signaling pathways (Nath2020Extended; Nath2019Extended). The SMP domain is involved in lipid binding and transfer, contributing to the protein's role in maintaining lipid homeostasis (Zhang2020Hypothalamic).

While specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of ESYT3 are not provided, the presence of these domains suggests a complex structure that supports its functional roles. The protein may also undergo post-translational modifications and exist in different splice variant isoforms, which could influence its function and localization (Zhang2020Hypothalamic).

## Function
Extended synaptotagmin 3 (ESYT3) is a protein involved in lipid droplet (LD) biogenesis and growth, particularly in adipocytes. It facilitates lipid exchange between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lipid droplets by forming contact junctions, which are crucial for the initial stages of LD formation. ESYT3 undergoes proteolytic processing, where the C2C domain is cleaved, allowing the protein to relocate from the ER to the surface of lipid droplets. This process is regulated by the proteasome and is essential for ESYT3's function in lipid transport and organelle biogenesis (Lalioti2020The).

ESYT3 is also involved in the transport of glycerophospholipids, such as phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC), which are critical for LD formation and growth. The protein's SMP domain binds to PE, a major component of the LD membrane, promoting LD biogenesis. The repression of ESYT3 expression inhibits LD biogenesis, highlighting its importance in this process (Lalioti2020The).

In addition to its role in adipocytes, ESYT3 is expressed in Leydig cells within the mouse testis, where it is involved in lipid transport and the anchoring of the ER to the cell membrane (Jauregui2018Leydig).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ESYT3 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of dietary obesity and related metabolic disorders, overexpression of ESYT3 in the hypothalamus, particularly in arcuate nucleus neurons, has been associated with increased obesity and metabolic syndromes such as hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, and glucose intolerance. Conversely, deletion of ESYT3 in specific neurons can protect against diet-induced obesity and improve metabolic parameters, suggesting its significant role in energy balance and obesity development (Zhang2020Hypothalamic).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), ESYT3 expression levels are linked to radioresistance. Overexpression of ESYT3 has been shown to enhance radioimmune responses by activating the cGAS-STING pathway, which is crucial for the immune response to DNA damage. This suggests that ESYT3 could be a potential therapeutic target for improving radiotherapy efficacy in LUAD (Luo2024Overexpression). The gene's expression is lower in radioresistant LUAD tissues, indicating that its down-regulation is associated with increased radioresistance and poorer patient prognosis (Luo2024Overexpression). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ESYT3 in both metabolic and cancer-related contexts.

## Interactions
ESYT3 interacts with the STING protein, a crucial component of the DNA damage response pathway. This interaction is significant in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cells, where ESYT3 overexpression leads to the activation of the cGAS-STING signaling pathway. This activation results in increased levels of phosphorylated STING (p-STING), cGAS, p-TBK1, and p-IRF3, which are important for enhancing radioimmune responses in these cells (Luo2024Overexpression). Co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analyses have confirmed the direct interaction between ESYT3 and STING, and immunofluorescence staining has shown their subcellular co-localization in LUAD cells (Luo2024Overexpression).

In adipocytes, ESYT3 is involved in lipid droplet (LD) biogenesis and interacts with proteins such as PLIN1. The interaction occurs at a specialized ER-derived organelle known as the primordial cisterna, which is involved in LD formation. E-Syt3, a variant of ESYT3, is processed proteolytically to facilitate its targeting to LDs, where it plays a role in lipid exchange between the endoplasmic reticulum and LDs (Lalioti2020The). These interactions highlight ESYT3's role in both cancer biology and lipid metabolism.
