# SFMBT2

## Overview
The SFMBT2 gene encodes the protein Scm like with four mbt domains 2, which is a member of the Polycomb group (PcG) family involved in chromatin regulation. This protein is characterized by the presence of a sterile α motif (SAM) domain and four malignant brain tumor (MBT) domains, which facilitate its role in gene regulation by binding to methylated lysine residues on histones H3 and H4. As a chromatin regulator, SFMBT2 plays a critical role in maintaining cellular identity and regulating developmental processes, particularly through its interaction with transcription factors such as SOX9. The protein's function is modulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and acetylation, which influence its stability and activity. SFMBT2 is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including chondrocyte differentiation and proliferation, as well as tumor suppression in certain cancers (Hussain2018SFMBT2; Xie2024Acetylation).

## Structure
SFMBT2 is a human gene encoding a protein that is part of the Polycomb group (PcG) family, involved in chromatin regulation. The SFMBT2 protein contains a sterile α motif (SAM) domain and four malignant brain tumor (MBT) domains, which are crucial for its role in gene regulation by recognizing and binding to methylated lysine residues in histones H3 and H4 (Hussain2018SFMBT2). These domains contribute to the protein's ability to influence gene expression by interacting with chromatin.

The primary structure of SFMBT2 includes sequences that allow for these interactions, while the secondary structure likely involves common motifs such as alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of MBT domain-containing proteins. The tertiary structure would encompass the overall 3D conformation necessary for its function in chromatin binding and regulation. Although specific details on the quaternary structure of SFMBT2 are not provided, it is known to associate with various polypeptides, suggesting potential multimeric assemblies (Zhang2013SFMBT1).

SFMBT2 is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may affect its function. The presence of splice variants can lead to different isoforms, potentially altering its regulatory roles in chromatin dynamics (Hussain2018SFMBT2).

## Function
The SFMBT2 gene in humans is involved in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. It is a member of the Polycomb group (PcG) protein family and plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular identity and regulating developmental processes. SFMBT2 is known to positively regulate the transcription factor SOX9, which is essential for chondrocyte differentiation and proliferation. This regulation is significant during early cartilage development and chondrogenesis, where SFMBT2 expression is increased (Hussain2018SFMBT2).

In human chondrocytes, SFMBT2 upregulates SOX9 expression in a dose-dependent manner, promoting chondrocyte proliferation. This suggests that SFMBT2 plays a role in cartilage repair and could be a target for therapeutic strategies in osteoarthritis management (Hussain2018SFMBT2). The gene's function in healthy human cells is related to maintaining chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation, which are crucial for cartilage development and repair (Hussain2018SFMBT2).

SFMBT2 also helps restore decreased levels of SOX9 in chondrocytes following treatment with inflammatory cytokines, indicating its potential protective role against inflammatory conditions (Hussain2018SFMBT2). This protective function highlights its importance in maintaining the homeostatic balance of chondrocytes.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and regulation of the SFMBT2 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly various forms of cancer. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), SFMBT2 acts as a tumor suppressor. Its expression is significantly lower in advanced stages of the disease, correlating with poor survival outcomes. The gene undergoes decreased acetylation and increased ubiquitination in advanced stages, which may contribute to its reduced tumor suppressor function (Xie2024Acetylation). Overexpression of SFMBT2 in RCC cells inhibits growth and metastasis, while knockdown promotes these processes, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Xie2024Acetylation).

In osteoarthritis (OA), SFMBT2 is downregulated in cartilage, which is associated with increased expression of catabolic genes and decreased expression of anabolic genes, contributing to cartilage degradation. This downregulation may promote a catabolic phenotype in chondrocytes, exacerbating OA progression (Hussain2018Down‐regulated).

In glioma, circ_SFMBT2, a circular RNA derived from SFMBT2, is downregulated and acts as a tumor suppressor by modulating the miR-182-5p/MTSS1 pathway, affecting cell proliferation and metastasis (Zhang2020Circular). Conversely, in gastric cancer, circ-SFMBT2 is upregulated and promotes cancer cell proliferation by interacting with miR-182-5p (Sun2018CircSFMBT2).

## Interactions
SFMBT2, a member of the Polycomb group proteins, is involved in various protein interactions that contribute to its role in gene regulation. It interacts with the transcription factor YY1, enhancing its transcriptional repression activity on the HOXB13 gene promoter in DU145 prostate cancer cells. This interaction is significant for maintaining the inactive state of the HOXB13 gene, which is associated with repressive histone marks such as di- and trimethylated H3K9 and H4K20, as well as trimethylated H3K27 (Lee2012Regulation).

In clear cell renal cell carcinoma, SFMBT2 interacts with histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) and seven in absentia homolog 1 (SIAH1). HDAC3 mediates the deacetylation of SFMBT2, promoting its ubiquitination and degradation through SIAH1, an E3 ligase. This regulation is crucial for SFMBT2's tumor suppressor functions, as acetylation at the K687 site prevents its degradation (Xie2024Acetylation).

SFMBT2 also associates with CASZ1, a zinc finger domain-containing protein, and is part of the PRC1.4 complex, which is homologous to the Drosophila PhoRC complex. This suggests a role in DNA binding and chromatin remodeling (Zhang2013SFMBT1). These interactions highlight SFMBT2's involvement in transcriptional repression and chromatin modification.
