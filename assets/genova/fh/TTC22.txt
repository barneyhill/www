# TTC22

## Overview
TTC22, or tetratricopeptide repeat domain 22, is a gene that encodes a protein characterized by the presence of tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which are integral to protein-protein interactions. The TTC22 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including molecular chaperone functions, cell cycle regulation, and signal transduction, due to its TPR domains. It is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, playing a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and contributing to organismal development (Acevedo2015Ageassociated). The protein exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, which may influence its structural and functional properties, allowing it to participate in diverse cellular pathways. TTC22's involvement in fundamental cellular activities, such as transcription and protein transport, underscores its importance in maintaining cellular integrity and function (Tian2019miR663a‑TTC22V1). Despite its significant roles, the specific functions of TTC22 in healthy human cells remain underexplored, highlighting the need for further research to fully understand its biological impact.

## Structure
The TTC22 gene encodes a protein characterized by the presence of tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which are structural motifs involved in protein-protein interactions. These motifs typically form a helix-turn-helix structure, contributing to the protein's secondary and tertiary structures. The TPR motifs facilitate the protein's role in various cellular processes by enabling specific interactions with other proteins. The TTC22 protein may undergo post-translational modifications, which can influence its function and interactions. Additionally, the protein exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, which may affect its structural and functional properties. These isoforms can lead to variations in the protein's interaction capabilities and its involvement in cellular pathways. The presence of TPR motifs and the potential for post-translational modifications and splice variants highlight the complexity and versatility of the TTC22 protein in cellular functions.

## Function
TTC22, or tetratricopeptide repeat domain 22, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes through its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains. These domains are crucial for facilitating protein-protein interactions, which are essential for molecular chaperone functions, cell cycle regulation, and signal transduction. The TTC22 protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to cellular homeostasis and organismal development (Acevedo2015Ageassociated).

In healthy human cells, TTC22 is associated with mediating protein-protein interactions and chaperone activity, which are vital for maintaining proper cellular function and structure (Acevedo2015Ageassociated). The gene is expressed in epithelial cells within the normal gastrointestinal tract mucosa, indicating its role in maintaining the integrity and function of these tissues (Tian2019miR663a‑TTC22V1). The presence of TPR motifs in TTC22 suggests its involvement in processes related to the cell cycle, transcription, and protein transport complexes, highlighting its importance in fundamental cellular activities (Tian2019miR663a‑TTC22V1). Despite its significant roles, specific functions of TTC22 in healthy human cells remain underexplored, necessitating further research to fully elucidate its biological impact.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TTC22 gene have been implicated in the progression and metastasis of certain cancers, notably colon and pancreatic cancer. In colon cancer, high expression of TTC22 is associated with increased metastasis risk and shorter overall survival. This is primarily due to its role in promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by upregulating the SNAI1 gene through m6A RNA modification, which enhances cancer cell migration and metastasis, particularly to the lungs (You2022TTC22). TTC22 interacts with the 60S ribosomal protein L4 (RPL4) to stabilize and increase the translation efficiency of WTAP mRNA, further contributing to cancer progression (You2022TTC22).

In pancreatic cancer, high TTC22 expression correlates with poor prognosis, as it is linked to reduced overall and disease-specific survival. TTC22 influences immune infiltration and EMT, affecting the tumor microenvironment and promoting cancer cell migration, invasion, and proliferation (Ding2023TTC22). The gene's expression is negatively correlated with immune infiltration scores and certain immune cells, suggesting it may inhibit tumor immune processes (Ding2023TTC22). These findings highlight TTC22 as a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target in these cancers.
