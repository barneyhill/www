# OTULIN

## Overview
OTULIN is a gene that encodes the protein OTU deubiquitinase with linear linkage specificity, a specialized enzyme involved in the regulation of ubiquitin signaling pathways. This protein is categorized as a deubiquitinating enzyme, specifically targeting Met1-linked polyubiquitin chains, which are crucial for modulating various cellular processes, including immune responses and inflammation. OTULIN plays a vital role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by interacting with the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) to regulate nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling, thereby preventing excessive immune activation and inflammation (Keusekotten2013OTULIN; Damgaard2016The). Mutations in the OTULIN gene can lead to severe autoinflammatory conditions, underscoring its importance in immune regulation and disease prevention (Davidson2024Dominant; Zhou2016Biallelic).

## Structure
OTULIN, also known as FAM105B, is a deubiquitinase characterized by its specificity for Met1-linked polyubiquitin chains. The protein contains an OTU (ovarian tumor) domain, which spans the majority of the protein and is highly conserved across species (Keusekotten2013OTULIN). The catalytic domain of OTULIN, comprising amino acids 80-352, is sufficient for its linkage specificity and adopts an OTU fold similar to OTUB1, with a root-mean-square deviation of 2.1 Å (Keusekotten2013OTULIN). The catalytic triad of OTULIN consists of Cys129, His339, and Asn341, which can exist in an 'active' conformation or an 'inhibited' conformation, influenced by Asp336 (Keusekotten2013OTULIN).

The tertiary structure of OTULIN in complex with Met1-diUb reveals specific binding sites (S1 and S1') for ubiquitin moieties, with the distal and proximal ubiquitin moieties occupying these sites (Keusekotten2013OTULIN). The proximal ubiquitin moiety plays a crucial role in substrate-assisted catalysis, where Glu16 of the proximal ubiquitin activates the catalytic triad by displacing inhibitory residues and aligning catalytic residues (Keusekotten2013OTULIN). OTULIN interacts with the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) through its N-terminus, which contains a PUB-interaction motif (PIM) that binds the HOIP PUB domain with high affinity (Elliott2015Regulation).

## Function
OTULIN, also known as FAM105B, is a deubiquitinating enzyme that specifically hydrolyzes Met1-linked polyubiquitin chains, playing a crucial role in regulating immune signaling pathways and maintaining cellular homeostasis. It is involved in modulating nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling, which is essential for controlling inflammation and preventing excessive immune responses (Keusekotten2013OTULIN; Damgaard2016The). OTULIN interacts with the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) to regulate Met1-linked ubiquitination, thereby influencing NF-κB activation and cell fate decisions (Weinelt2020Ubiquitindependent).

In healthy cells, OTULIN prevents the accumulation of Met1-linked polyubiquitin chains, inhibiting uncoordinated NF-κB activation and sterile inflammation (Damgaard2016The). It plays a significant role in autophagy by regulating the stability and ubiquitination of key autophagy-related proteins, affecting autophagosome formation and maturation (Chu2020LUBAC). OTULIN is also involved in xenophagy, where it helps in the removal of intracellular bacteria by regulating linear ubiquitin chains on bacterial surfaces (Verboom2021OTULIN).

OTULIN's activity is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing autoimmunity, as evidenced by its role in suppressing excessive cytokine secretion and inflammation in myeloid cells (Damgaard2016The). Its deficiency can lead to severe autoinflammatory diseases, highlighting its importance in normal physiological processes (Verboom2021OTULIN).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the OTULIN gene are associated with several autoinflammatory conditions. OTULIN-related autoinflammatory syndrome (ORAS) is a notable condition caused by mutations in this gene. ORAS can result from both biallelic loss-of-function mutations and dominant negative mutations, such as the OTULIN:p.Cys129Ser mutation. This mutation leads to the accumulation of linear ubiquitin chains, dysregulation of NF-κB signaling, and increased sensitivity to TNF-induced cell death, contributing to severe autoinflammatory symptoms including skin involvement (Davidson2024Dominant).

Another condition linked to OTULIN mutations is otulipenia, characterized by biallelic hypomorphic mutations that result in excessive linear ubiquitination and enhanced NF-κB activity. This leads to severe inflammation, often presenting with neonatal-onset fever and neutrophilic dermatitis (Zhou2016Biallelic).

Compound heterozygous variants in OTULIN, such as p.M86I and p.W167S, also contribute to atypical late-onset ORAS. These variants affect OTULIN's stability and catalytic activity, leading to defective hydrolysis of linear ubiquitin linkages and contributing to autoinflammatory conditions mediated by TNF receptor 1 (Zinngrebe2022Compound).

## Interactions
OTULIN interacts with the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), specifically binding to the HOIP component through a conserved PUB-interacting motif (PIM). This interaction is crucial for OTULIN's role in regulating LUBAC-induced NF-κB activation. The binding is highly specific and of high affinity, with structural studies revealing the molecular basis for this specificity. Phosphorylation of OTULIN can regulate this interaction by preventing its binding to HOIP (Elliott2014Molecular).

OTULIN also interacts with other components of the LUBAC complex, such as HOIL-1, and plays a role in preventing the autoubiquitination of LUBAC components under basal conditions. Mutations in either OTULIN or HOIP can disrupt this interaction, affecting NF-κB signaling (Fiil2013OTULIN; Elliott2014Molecular).

In addition to its interactions with LUBAC, OTULIN is involved in the regulation of the endosomal SNX27-retromer complex. It interacts with SNX27 through its C-terminal PDZbm, which is important for the redistribution of SNX27 away from endosomal compartments. This interaction does not affect OTULIN's role in controlling Met1-linked ubiquitin chains and NF-κB signaling (Stangl2019Regulation).
