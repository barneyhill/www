# ATP6V0E2

## Overview
ATP6V0E2 is a gene that encodes the ATPase H+ transporting V0 subunit e2, a component of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) complex. This protein is a transmembrane subunit involved in the acidification of intracellular compartments, a process essential for various cellular functions such as protein degradation, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and neurotransmitter release. The ATP6V0E2 protein is predominantly active in lysosomes, endosomes, and the Golgi apparatus, where it contributes to maintaining the acidic environment necessary for these organelles' functions (Merkulova2015Mapping; Sun2020Transcriptome). The gene exhibits tissue-specific expression, with high levels in the heart, brain, and kidney, indicating its role in specialized physiological processes (BlakePalmer2007Molecular). Additionally, ATP6V0E2 has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly in the context of anlotinib treatment, where it enhances lysosomal function and autophagy, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Sun2020Transcriptome).

## Structure
The ATP6V0E2 gene encodes a novel form of the human vacuolar H+-ATPase e-subunit, known as e2. This protein is composed of 81 amino acids, with a predicted molecular weight of 9.2 kDa (BlakePalmer2007Molecular). The e2 subunit is characterized by two potential transmembrane-spanning segments, similar to the e1 subunit, and contains a unique YVRF motif in its C-terminal region, which may interact with the AP complex involved in membrane trafficking (BlakePalmer2007Molecular).

The e2 subunit is expressed in a tissue-restricted manner, with high levels in the heart, brain, and kidney, and is also found in the inner ear, male genital tissue, and bladder (BlakePalmer2007Molecular). A splice variant of the e2 gene, which lacks the third exon, results in a frameshift and a predicted protein that is 83 amino acids longer. This variant is expressed in the heart, kidney, placenta, and pancreas, and in various brain areas except the frontal cortex (BlakePalmer2007Molecular).

The e2 subunit's structural similarity to the yeast ortholog suggests its essential role in H+-ATPase function, as demonstrated by its ability to rescue yeast cells lacking a functional V-ATPase (BlakePalmer2007Molecular). The specific molecular structure of ATP6V0E2, including its tertiary and quaternary structures, is not detailed in the available context.

## Function
ATP6V0E2 encodes a subunit of the V0 domain of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) complex, which is essential for acidifying intracellular compartments in eukaryotic cells. This acidification is crucial for various cellular processes, including protein degradation, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and neurotransmitter release. The ATP6V0E2 protein is primarily active in lysosomes, endosomes, and the Golgi apparatus, where it contributes to maintaining the acidic environment necessary for these organelles' functions (Merkulova2015Mapping).

In healthy human cells, ATP6V0E2 is involved in lysosomal activation and function. It plays a role in the acidification of lysosomes, which is vital for lysosomal enzyme activity and the degradation of cellular components. This function is particularly important in the context of autophagy, a process that recycles cellular components and maintains cellular homeostasis (Sun2020Transcriptome). The gene is expressed in a tissue-restricted manner, with high levels in the heart, brain, and kidney, suggesting its role in specific physiological processes related to these tissues (BlakePalmer2007Molecular). The unique subunit composition of V-ATPases, including ATP6V0E2, may influence their cellular localization and activity, contributing to the specialized functions of proton pumps in different tissues (BlakePalmer2007Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
The ATP6V0E2 gene, encoding a subunit of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) complex, plays a significant role in lysosomal function and cellular processes such as autophagy. Alterations in ATP6V0E2 expression have been implicated in cancer, particularly in the context of anlotinib treatment for colon cancer. Anlotinib, a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, upregulates ATP6V0E2, enhancing lysosomal function and autophagy, which are crucial for its cytotoxic effects on cancer cells. Knockdown of ATP6V0E2 impairs lysosomal activation and increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, suggesting that ATP6V0E2 helps protect against anlotinib-induced apoptosis by regulating cellular redox status (Sun2020Transcriptome).

In gliomas, ATP6V0E2 expression patterns differ between aggressive glioblastoma and indolent IDH-mutant lower-grade gliomas, indicating its potential role in tumor aggressiveness and patient prognosis. Glioblastomas express ATP6V0E1 instead of ATP6V0E2, suggesting a glioma type-specific V-ATPase configuration that may influence tumor behavior and treatment response (Terrasi2019Specific). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ATP6V0E2 in cancer biology and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
ATP6V0E2 is a subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) complex, which is essential for acidifying intracellular compartments. This protein is involved in forming the proton pump by interacting with other V-ATPase subunits. Although specific protein interactions of ATP6V0E2 are not extensively detailed, it is known to be a transmembrane protein that does not directly interact with the B1 subunit of V-ATPase (Merkulova2015Mapping). The study by Blake-Palmer et al. suggests that ATP6V0E2 may have a unique role due to its tissue-specific expression and the presence of a YVRF sequence, which could predict interactions with the AP complex involved in membrane trafficking (BlakePalmer2007Molecular).

In the context of cancer treatment, ATP6V0E2 is implicated in lysosomal activation induced by anlotinib, a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. This activation is crucial for enhancing autophagy and lysosomal functions, which are important for the cytotoxic effects of anlotinib on cancer cells (Sun2020Transcriptome). The gene is regulated by TFEB, a master regulator of lysosome biogenesis, and its knockdown impairs lysosomal activation, suggesting its significant role in these processes (Sun2020Transcriptome).
