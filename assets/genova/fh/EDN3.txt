# EDN3

## Overview
The EDN3 gene encodes the protein endothelin 3, a member of the endothelin family of peptides, which are known for their roles as signaling molecules in various physiological processes. Endothelin 3 is a secreted peptide that functions primarily as a signaling molecule involved in the development of neural crest-derived cells, including melanocytes and enteric neurons. It plays a critical role in the differentiation and migration of these cells, influencing processes such as pigmentation and the formation of the enteric nervous system. The protein interacts with specific receptors, such as the endothelin receptor type B (EDNRB), to mediate its effects. Dysregulation of EDN3 expression or function is associated with several clinical conditions, including Waardenburg syndrome type 4 and certain cancers, highlighting its importance in both developmental biology and disease (Gazquez2016Endothelin3; Wiesmann2009Frequent; Pingault2010Review).

## Function
Endothelin 3 (EDN3) plays a significant role in various cellular and organismal processes. In melanocyte development, EDN3 is crucial for the differentiation of neural crest (NC) cells into melanocytes. It works in conjunction with Kit-ligand (Kitl) to promote the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of melanoblasts. The absence of either EDN3 or Kit signaling results in a significant loss of melanoblasts, indicating that these pathways are not compensatory. Fully pigmented melanocytes require both EDN3 and Kitl, highlighting a cooperative interaction between Kit and EDNrb signaling in melanocyte development (SaldanaCaboverde2010Roles).

In the context of adipose tissue, EDN3 promotes the thermogenic differentiation of white preadipocytes through the EDNRB signaling pathway. This process involves the activation of the cAMP-EPAC1-ERK pathway, which is crucial for the thermogenic differentiation of adipose precursors. EDN3 enhances the expression of UCP1, a marker of thermogenic differentiation, and increases mitochondrial respiration, contributing to the browning of white adipose tissue (Wang2024Endothelin).

EDN3 also plays a role in the development of the enteric nervous system by enhancing the adhesion and migration of enteric neural crest cells (ENCCs). It increases the number and size of focal adhesions, promoting proper gut colonization (Gazquez2016Endothelin3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the EDN3 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. In breast cancer, EDN3 is frequently downregulated due to promoter hypermethylation, an epigenetic modification that silences gene expression. This downregulation is linked to poorer cancer-specific survival and is considered an independent prognostic factor, with a twofold increased risk of death from breast cancer. The loss of EDN3 expression is observed in a significant percentage of breast carcinoma specimens, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor gene in the mammary gland (Wiesmann2009Frequent).

In endometrioid endometrial cancer, EDN3 is also downregulated, potentially due to DNA methylation, which is a common mechanism leading to gene silencing in cancer progression. High levels of EDN3 are associated with a low-risk cancer phenotype, indicating its potential role in cancer development (Zmarzły2022Endothelin3).

EDN3 mutations are implicated in Waardenburg syndrome type 4 (WS4), also known as Shah-Waardenburg syndrome, characterized by deafness, depigmentation, and Hirschsprung disease. These mutations affect neural crest cell development, leading to the absence of enteric ganglia and epidermal melanocytes (Mccallion2001EDNRBEDN3; Pingault2010Review). EDN3 is also associated with Hirschsprung disease, a condition marked by the absence of nerve cells in parts of the intestine, contributing to bowel obstruction (Sánchezmejías2010New).

## Interactions
Endothelin-3 (EDN3) is involved in several critical interactions that influence the development of the enteric nervous system (ENS). EDN3 interacts with β1-integrins, which are essential for the adhesion and migration of enteric neural crest cells (ENCCs). This interaction enhances the formation and maturation of focal adhesions, which are crucial for ENCC adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) and subsequent colonization of the gut (Gazquez2016Endothelin3). EDN3 stimulates the activation of β1-integrins and paxillin at cell-ECM interfaces, promoting lamellipodia formation and actin cytoskeleton remodeling, which are vital for cell polarization and directional migration (Gazquez2016Endothelin3).

EDN3 also interacts with retinoic acid (RA) signaling pathways, where it modulates the expression of RA receptor genes and RA metabolic enzymes. This interaction affects the differentiation and morphology of ENS precursors, with EDN3 reducing the expression of RA receptor genes Rarb and Rarg in the presence of RA (Gisser2013A). The bidirectional interaction between EDN3 and RA influences the cellular composition of ENS cultures, affecting the prevalence of specific cell types and gene expression (Gisser2013A).
