# OLAH

## Overview
The OLAH gene encodes the protein oleoyl-ACP hydrolase, which is involved in lipid metabolism. This enzyme is categorized as a hydrolase, specifically functioning to hydrolyze oleoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) to release free oleic acid. Oleoyl-ACP hydrolase plays a crucial role in the regulation of fatty acid biosynthesis and degradation, impacting cellular lipid homeostasis. The activity of this enzyme is significant in various biological processes, including membrane biogenesis and energy storage. Dysregulation of the OLAH gene or its protein product can have implications in metabolic disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in understanding and potentially treating such conditions.
