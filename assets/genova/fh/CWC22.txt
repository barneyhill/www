# CWC22

## Overview
CWC22 is a human gene that encodes the CWC22 spliceosome-associated protein homolog, a critical component in the pre-mRNA splicing process. This protein is categorized as a spliceosomal protein and is integral to the assembly of the exon junction complex (EJC), which is essential for mRNA processing, export, and surveillance. The CWC22 protein contains distinct structural domains, including the MIF4G and MA3 domains, which facilitate its interaction with other spliceosomal components, particularly the DEAD-box helicase eIF4AIII. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the fidelity of mRNA splicing and subsequent processes such as nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). CWC22's role in these pathways underscores its importance in gene expression regulation and its potential implications in various diseases, including diabetic polyneuropathy and colon cancer (Buchwald2013Crystal; Alexandrov2012Human; Barbosa2012Human).

## Structure
The human CWC22 protein is characterized by the presence of MIF4G and MA3 domains. The MIF4G domain spans residues 145-350 and is composed of five HEAT repeats, each formed by two antiparallel α-helices, creating a crescent-shaped structure. The convex surface is formed by A helices, while the concave surface is formed by B helices. This domain is atypical due to a C-terminal extension of approximately 60 residues that stretches over the MIF4G fold, forming extensive hydrophobic interactions and ending with an α-helix that binds the HEAT 1 helices. This extension is considered an integral part of the MIF4G domain due to its apolar intramolecular contacts (Buchwald2013Crystal).

The interaction between CWC22 and eIF4AIII involves the MIF4G domain binding to the RecA2 domain of eIF4AIII, with the N-terminal helices anchoring RecA2 and the C-terminal helices latching onto RecA1. This interaction maintains eIF4AIII in an inactive state by positioning the RNA-binding and ATP-binding motifs oppositely, preventing active state configuration (Buchwald2013Crystal). The MIF4G domain is crucial for binding eIF4A3, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Steckelberg2012CWC22). CWC22 is also known to undergo alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms (Barbosa2012Human).

## Function
The human gene CWC22 encodes a spliceosomal protein that plays a critical role in coupling splicing to exon junction complex (EJC) deposition and nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) (Alexandrov2012Human). CWC22 is essential for the proper assembly of the EJC, a multi-protein complex that assembles on mRNA after splicing and is crucial for mRNA export, translation, and NMD (Barbosa2012Human). The protein interacts directly with the core EJC component eIF4AIII, facilitating its deposition on spliced mRNA, which is necessary for mRNA surveillance and stability (Alexandrov2012Human; Barbosa2012Human).

CWC22 is also involved in the degradation of endogenous spliced NMD targets, such as the UHG transcript, linking it functionally to mRNA surveillance pathways (Alexandrov2012Human). It acts as an escort for eIF4AIII to spliceosomes, ensuring the fidelity of mRNA processing and influencing downstream processes like mRNA stability and translation (Barbosa2012Human). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it maintains proper splicing and RNA processing, which are essential for accurate gene expression and mRNA maturation (Yeh2011Splicing).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the CWC22 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN), CWC22 is upregulated in diabetic dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory nuclei, which may contribute to sensory neuron degeneration by affecting pre-mRNA splicing. This upregulation is associated with impaired neuronal function, and knockdown of CWC22 has been shown to improve sensory function in diabetic mice, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Kobayashi2017Diabetic).

In colon cancer, CWC22 has been identified as a potential prognostic marker. Although not significantly differentially expressed, its expression levels are associated with survival rates in colon cancer patients, particularly in relation to lymph node involvement. This suggests that CWC22 may play a role in the progression of colon cancer and could be a candidate for further research into treatment options (Han2020Gene).

CWC22 is also involved in the process of exon junction complex (EJC) deposition and nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). Disruptions in its interaction with the core EJC component eIF4AIII can lead to splicing defects, which may have implications for diseases associated with mRNA surveillance and degradation (Alexandrov2012Human).

## Interactions
CWC22 is a human protein that plays a crucial role in pre-mRNA splicing and the assembly of the exon junction complex (EJC). It interacts specifically with the DEAD-box helicase eIF4AIII, a core component of the EJC. This interaction is mediated by the MIF4G domain of CWC22, which binds to both RecA domains of eIF4AIII, inhibiting its ATPase activity and facilitating its recruitment to the spliceosome (Buchwald2013Crystal; Steckelberg2012CWC22). The binding involves specific residues such as CWC22 Tyr133 and Arg140, which interact with eIF4AIII Asp270 and Asp266, respectively (Buchwald2013Crystal).

CWC22 does not interact with other EJC core proteins like MAGOH and Y14, indicating a specific role in recruiting eIF4AIII to the spliceosome (Steckelberg2012CWC22). The interaction between CWC22 and eIF4AIII is essential for the splicing-dependent assembly of the EJC, which is crucial for mRNA processing and nonsense-mediated decay (Steckelberg2012CWC22; Alexandrov2012Human). Mutations in the MIF4G domain of CWC22 or in eIF4AIII that disrupt this interaction lead to defects in EJC deposition and splicing (Steckelberg2012CWC22; Alexandrov2012Human).
