# EFNA4

## Overview
EFNA4 is a gene that encodes the protein ephrin A4, a member of the ephrin family, which are ligands for Eph receptors. Ephrin A4 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein, characteristic of type A ephrins, and plays a significant role in cell signaling processes that influence cell positioning, shape, and movement (AlonsoC2009Expression; Chen2021Ephrin). The EFNA4 gene is expressed in two mRNA splice variants, leading to different isoforms of the protein, which are involved in various physiological and pathological processes, including immune cell trafficking, angiogenesis, and cancer progression (AlonsoC2009Expression; Du2012EphrinA4). Ephrin A4 interacts with several Eph receptors, such as EPHA2 and EPHA10, to mediate signaling pathways that are crucial for cellular functions and have been implicated in diseases like cancer and craniosynostosis (Lin2021EFNA4; Merrill2006Cell).

## Structure
EFNA4, also known as ephrin A4, is a member of the ephrin family, which are ligands for Eph receptors. The protein is typically anchored to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, a characteristic feature of type A ephrins (AlonsoC2009Expression). EFNA4 is expressed in two mRNA splice variants: EFNA4L, the long isoform, and EFNA4S, the short isoform. EFNA4L encodes a membrane-bound protein, while EFNA4S is presumed to code for a soluble isoform (AlonsoC2009Expression). 

The molecular structure of EFNA4 includes an ephrin domain, which is crucial for its interaction with Eph receptors. This domain facilitates receptor binding, which is essential for the protein's role in cell signaling and tissue organization (Lavoie2024EPHA1). Although specific details about the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of EFNA4 are not provided, the presence of a GPI anchor and the existence of splice variants suggest structural diversity that may influence its function and interaction with receptors. Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation may also play a role in the stability and function of EFNA4, although specific modifications are not detailed in the available context.

## Function
EFNA4 (ephrin A4) is a member of the ephrin family, which plays a crucial role in cell signaling processes that guide cell positioning, shape, and movement. In healthy human cells, EFNA4 is involved in the trafficking and adhesion of immune cells. It is upregulated on monocyte subsets and facilitates monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells through interactions with EphA4, activating the RhoA signaling pathway. This interaction enhances monocyte-endothelial cell adhesion, suggesting a role in immune cell retention at inflammation sites (Darling2019Emerging). EFNA4 is also implicated in T cell trafficking, interacting with EphA2 to mediate T cell movement between blood and lymph nodes, and may modulate T cell chemotaxis in response to chemokine gradients (Darling2019Emerging).

EFNA4 is expressed in healthy human B lymphocytes, with two mRNA splice variants, EFNA4L and EFNA4S, which are differentially expressed based on the activation state of the B-cells. In peripheral blood B-cells, EFNA4L is more abundant, while lymph node B-cells have similar amounts of both isoforms. Activation of B-cells in vitro leads to increased EFNA4S expression, indicating its role in B-cell activation (AlonsoC2009Expression). EFNA4 is also involved in angiogenesis through the VEGF signaling pathway, influencing processes such as tube formation and cell proliferation (Du2012EphrinA4).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the EFNA4 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly various forms of cancer. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), EFNA4 is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis, including reduced overall survival and progression-free survival. Its overexpression promotes cell proliferation and migration by activating the EPHA2 receptor and influencing the PIK3R2/GSK3β/β-catenin signaling axis, contributing to tumor metastasis and progression (Lin2021EFNA4).

In lung adenocarcinoma, EFNA4 is frequently amplified and upregulated, particularly in cases with lymph node metastasis. This overexpression enhances tumor cell proliferation, migration, and adhesion, and is linked to poor survival rates, suggesting its role as an oncogenic driver in lung cancer metastasis (Zhao2022Oncogenic).

EFNA4 is also upregulated in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), where it promotes tumorigenesis and metastasis through the EFNA4-EPHA10 signaling axis, upregulating stemness-related transcription factors like NANOG and OCT4. This signaling is crucial for cell migration and spheroid formation, indicating EFNA4's role in cancer stem cell characteristics and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Chen2021Ephrin).

Additionally, mutations in EFNA4 have been linked to non-syndromic coronal craniosynostosis, a condition characterized by premature fusion of skull bones. Specific mutations disrupt ephrin-Eph signaling, affecting cranial suture development and leading to craniosynostosis (Merrill2006Cell).

## Interactions
EFNA4 (ephrin A4) is known to interact with several Eph receptors, particularly EPHA2 and EPHA10, facilitating various cellular processes. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), EFNA4 binds to the EPHA2 receptor, activating a signaling cascade involving the PIK3R2/GSK3β/β-catenin axis. This interaction promotes cell proliferation and metastasis by enhancing the phosphorylation of GSK3β and β-catenin, which prevents β-catenin degradation and supports its nuclear translocation (Lin2021EFNA4).

In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), EFNA4 interacts with EPHA10 to promote cell migration and spheroid formation. This process is mediated through the activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, which upregulates stemness-related transcription factors such as NANOG and OCT4. The EFNA4-EPHA10 interaction is crucial for these cellular functions, as knockdown of EPHA10 disrupts EFNA4-induced sphere formation (Chen2021Ephrin).

EFNA4 also plays a role in retinal neovascularization by interacting with the VEGF signaling pathway. It influences the phosphorylation of VEGFR2, Akt1, and ERK1/2, which are essential for the proangiogenic function of VEGF 165 (Du2012EphrinA4). These interactions highlight EFNA4's involvement in various signaling pathways across different tissue types.
