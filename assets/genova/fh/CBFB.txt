# CBFB

## Overview
The CBFB gene encodes the core-binding factor subunit beta (CBFβ), a non-DNA-binding regulatory protein that plays a pivotal role in transcriptional regulation. CBFβ is a component of the core-binding factor (CBF) complex, which is essential for the regulation of genes involved in hematopoiesis and bone development. The protein enhances the DNA-binding affinity of the Runt domain of RUNX transcription factors, thereby facilitating the transcription of target genes critical for cellular differentiation and proliferation (Zhang2003Structural; Kundu2003Cbfβ). CBFβ is also implicated in various pathological conditions, most notably acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where chromosomal rearrangements lead to the formation of the CBFβ-MYH11 fusion protein, disrupting normal hematopoietic processes (Padmavathi2017Importance; Castilla1996Failure). The structural integrity and functional interactions of CBFβ are crucial for its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing oncogenic transformations (Malik2019The; Bushweller2000CBF—A).

## Structure
The CBFB protein, encoded by the CBFB gene, exhibits a novel α/β fold structure. Its secondary structure includes a combination of α-helices and β-strands. The N-terminal region features α-helices 1 and 2, followed by β-strand 1, a short 3_10 helix, and α-helix 3. This is succeeded by β-strands 2 and 3, forming a three-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet. The C-terminal region comprises β-strands 4, 5, and 6, which also form a three-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet, concluding with α-helix 4. These elements are connected by a flexible loop, as demonstrated by NMR relaxation measurements (Bushweller2000CBF—A).

The tertiary structure of CBFB involves the arrangement of these elements into a specific fold that facilitates interaction with the Runt domain of RUNX transcription factors. CBFB enhances the DNA-binding affinity of the Runt domain by 6- to 10-fold, although it does not directly contact DNA (Zhang2003Structural). The quaternary structure is characterized by the formation of a complex with the Runt domain and DNA, where CBFB modulates the binding affinity of the Runt domain (Zhang2003Structural). The protein also contains a conserved beta-sandwich domain (Bushweller2000CBF—A).

## Function
The CBFB gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in both transcription and translation regulation in healthy human cells. Traditionally, CBFB is known for its role in the nucleus, where it forms a complex with RUNX1 to regulate the transcription of various genes. This complex is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing dysregulation that can lead to cancer (Malik2019The). In the cytoplasm, CBFB has a noncanonical role in translation regulation, where it binds to hundreds of mRNA transcripts, including RUNX1 mRNA, enhancing their translation through interactions with RNA-binding proteins like hnRNPK and eIF4B (Malik2019The).

CBFB is also involved in hematopoiesis, the formation of blood cellular components, by stabilizing the DNA-binding component of the core-binding factor complex, enhancing its ability to regulate target genes (Kundu2003Cbfβ). It is expressed in hematopoietic stem cells and is crucial for the maturation of all hematopoietic lineages except erythroid cells (Kundu2002Role). Additionally, CBFB plays a role in bone formation by enhancing the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells through its interaction with CBFA-1, a transcription factor critical for bone formation (Lien2007Cbfb).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CBFB gene are significantly associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), particularly the M4Eo subtype. This is primarily due to the formation of the CBFB-MYH11 fusion gene, resulting from chromosomal rearrangements such as inversion inv(16)(p13;q22) or translocation t(16;16)(p13;q22). The fusion gene produces the CBFβ-SMMHC oncoprotein, which disrupts normal hematopoietic differentiation by sequestering CBFα2 into cytoskeletal filaments, thereby interfering with its transcriptional regulation role (Padmavathi2017Importance; Adya1998The).

The presence of the CBFβ-SMMHC fusion protein is associated with a dominant negative effect, blocking myeloid differentiation and leading to leukemia development. Despite its role in leukemogenesis, the presence of this fusion protein is linked to better clinical outcomes, such as higher remission rates and longer relapse-free survival (Padmavathi2017Importance; Castilla1996Failure).

In mouse models, the CBFB-MYH11 fusion gene has been shown to cause failure in definitive hematopoiesis and embryonic lethality, indicating its critical role in disrupting normal hematopoietic processes (Castilla1996Failure; Castilla1999The). The fusion gene also affects T-cell development, leading to developmental blocks and increased apoptosis in the thymus (Zhao2006CBFBMYH11).

## Interactions
The CBFB protein, a non-DNA-binding subunit of the core binding factor, interacts with the DNA-binding subunit Runx, specifically binding to the Runt domain of Runx1. This interaction enhances the DNA-binding affinity of Runx1 by approximately sixfold, which is crucial for the function of CBF in hematopoiesis and is implicated in leukemogenesis when altered (Bushweller2000CBF—A). The interaction between CBFB and Runx1 involves specific regions on CBFB, including β-strands and loops, as identified through NMR chemical shift perturbation analysis (Bushweller2000CBF—A).

CBFB also forms a chimeric protein, CBFβ-SMMHC, through fusion with MYH11 due to chromosomal inversion. This fusion protein sequesters CBFα2 into cytoskeletal filaments and aggregates, disrupting its nuclear localization and function, which contributes to leukemogenesis (Adya1998The). The interaction between CBFβ-SMMHC and CBFα2 is direct and requires specific amino acids for binding (Adya1998The).

In breast cancer, CBFB interacts with hnRNPK, a protein involved in translation regulation, to bind to hundreds of mRNAs. This interaction is crucial for the translation of RUNX1 mRNA and involves the translation initiation factor eIF4B, which stimulates translation initiation (Malik2019The).
