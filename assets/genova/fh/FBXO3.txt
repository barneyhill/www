# FBXO3

## Overview
FBXO3 is a gene that encodes the F-box protein 3, a member of the F-box protein family, which is integral to the SCF (Skp1-Cullin1-F-box) ubiquitin ligase complex. This complex is pivotal in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a primary mechanism for protein degradation in eukaryotic cells. The FBXO3 protein is characterized by its F-box domain, which facilitates its role in targeting specific proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Unlike other F-box proteins, FBXO3 lacks the leucine-rich repeat or WD40 domain, classifying it as an 'F-box only' protein. It contains an ApaG domain, which is essential for its interaction with other proteins, such as FBXL2, and plays a significant role in regulating cytokine-driven inflammation and protein quality control. FBXO3's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in various diseases, including cancer and autoimmune disorders (Mallampalli2013Targeting; Zhang2022Diverse; Krzysiak2016Crystal).

## Structure
The human FBXO3 protein is part of the F-box protein family and is involved in forming SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) complexes, which function as E3 ubiquitin ligases. The FBXO3 protein includes an F-box domain, which is a motif of approximately 40 amino acids, but it lacks the common leucine-rich repeat or WD40 domain found in other F-box proteins, leading to its designation as 'F-box only' (Krzysiak2016Crystal).

The FBXO3 protein contains an ApaG domain, spanning residues 278-407, which exhibits an Immunoglobin/Fibronectin III-type fold characterized by a seven-stranded beta-sheet core and four extended loops (Krzysiak2016Crystal). This domain shares 38% sequence identity with the E. coli ApaG protein and includes structural features such as an additional N-terminal beta-strand and a proline-induced break in the seventh beta-strand (Krzysiak2016Crystal). The ApaG domain is crucial for the interaction with the F-box protein FBXL2, although it is not sufficient on its own for binding and degradation (Krzysiak2016Crystal).

The FBXO3 protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and variants may exist due to alternative splicing (Krzysiak2016Crystal). The central beta-sheet core of the ApaG domain has been targeted for drug design to interfere with cytokine-driven inflammation (Krzysiak2016Crystal).

## Function
FBXO3 (F-box protein 3) is a crucial component of the SCF (Skp1-Cullin1-F-box) ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays a significant role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a key mechanism for protein degradation in eukaryotic cells. This protein is involved in the regulation of various cellular functions through its role in ubiquitination, a post-translational modification that targets proteins for degradation, thereby maintaining cellular protein concentrations and homeostasis (Zhang2022Diverse).

In healthy human cells, FBXO3 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences protein turnover and cellular homeostasis. It specifically targets proteins such as FBXL2 for degradation, which is involved in the regulation of cytokine-driven inflammation by promoting TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) signal transduction and cytokine gene transcription (Mallampalli2013Targeting; Zhang2022Diverse). FBXO3 also regulates the degradation of C21ORF2, a protein associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), through the ubiquitin-proteasome system, highlighting its role in protein quality control (Watanabe2020An).

FBXO3's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular function and organismal health by regulating protein stability and degradation pathways.

## Clinical Significance
FBXO3 is implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in protein degradation and regulation. In breast cancer, FBXO3 promotes metastasis by targeting ΔNp63α for degradation, a process facilitated by TGF-β signaling. This degradation leads to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), enhancing cell motility and tumor metastasis. High expression of FBXO3 correlates with poor recurrence-free survival in breast cancer patients, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Niu2021Noncanonical).

FBXO3 is also involved in inflammatory disorders. It regulates cytokine release by degrading FBXL2, a TRAF inhibitor, which influences inflammatory responses. Elevated FBXO3 expression is observed in rheumatoid arthritis, where it may contribute to synovial fibroblast proliferation (Weathington2013New).

In autoimmune diseases, FBXO3 affects the autoimmune regulator (AIRE), crucial for T cell development. Alterations in FBXO3 expression can lead to autoimmune conditions like type 1 diabetes mellitus and autoimmune thyroid diseases by impacting AIRE's transcriptional activity (Zhang2022Diverse).

FBXO3's role in cancer extends to leukemia, where it mediates the degradation of proteins within the promyelocytic leukemia protein complex, affecting p53 activity (Weathington2013New). Its involvement in various pathways highlights its significance in disease pathogenesis.

## Interactions
FBXO3 is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It forms a SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex with SKP1, Cullin1 (CUL1), and ring-box 1 (RBX1), which is crucial for its role as an E3 ligase (Shao2016FBXO3). FBXO3 interacts with the nonstructural protein NSs of the Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), facilitating the degradation of the transcription factor TFIIH-p62, thereby suppressing the antiviral type I interferon response (Kainulainen2014Virulence; Zhang2022Diverse). This interaction is mediated by the SCF complex, specifically involving Skp1, but not cullin 1 or Rbx1 (Kainulainen2014Virulence).

FBXO3 also interacts with the autoimmune regulator AIRE, promoting its ubiquitylation and enhancing its transcriptional activity on TSA genes. This interaction requires phosphorylation at specific residues on AIRE (Shao2016FBXO3). In the context of inflammation, FBXO3 targets FBXL2 for degradation, which affects tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) signaling and cytokine gene transcription (Mallampalli2013Targeting; Zhang2022Diverse). The ApaG domain of FBXO3 is essential for its interaction with FBXL2, as deletions in this domain impair the interaction (Krzysiak2016Crystal). These interactions highlight FBXO3's role in modulating immune responses and cellular signaling pathways.
