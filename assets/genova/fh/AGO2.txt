# AGO2

## Overview
AGO2 is a gene that encodes the protein argonaute RISC catalytic component 2, a member of the Argonaute protein family. This protein is integral to the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and plays a pivotal role in RNA interference (RNAi) and microRNA (miRNA) pathways. As the only Argonaute protein in mammals with catalytic activity, AGO2 is essential for the cleavage of target mRNA, facilitating gene silencing mediated by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (Liu2004Argonaute2; Meister2013Argonaute). Structurally, AGO2 is characterized by a bilobed architecture comprising four core domains: N, PAZ, MID, and PIWI, which are crucial for its function in binding and processing small RNAs (Li2020AGO2; Schirle2012The). The protein's interactions with various cellular components enable it to regulate gene expression at both the post-transcriptional and transcriptional levels, impacting processes such as mRNA degradation, translational repression, chromatin remodeling, and DNA repair (Li2020AGO2). Mutations in the AGO2 gene have been implicated in neurological disorders and cancer, underscoring its significance in maintaining genomic integrity and cellular homeostasis (Kim2010Somatic; Lessel2020Germline).

## Structure
AGO2, a member of the Argonaute protein family, is characterized by a bilobed structure composed of four core domains: N, PAZ, MID, and PIWI, connected by linker domains L1 and L2 (Li2020AGO2; Schirle2012The). The N domain is involved in the unwinding of small RNA duplexes, while the PAZ domain anchors the 3' end of small RNAs (Wu2020Argonaute; Li2020AGO2). The MID domain, featuring a Rossmann-like fold, binds the 5' phosphates of small RNAs and is crucial for nucleotide-specific interactions, showing a preference for uridine and adenosine monophosphates (Frank2010Structural; Li2020AGO2). The PIWI domain, resembling RNase H, contains a catalytic triad essential for its endonuclease activity, cleaving target RNAs (Li2020AGO2; Schirle2012The).

AGO2 undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which affect its localization and interaction with other proteins, influencing its role in RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) activation (Wu2020Argonaute; Li2020AGO2). These structural features and modifications are critical for AGO2's function in RNA interference and gene silencing.

## Function
AGO2 (argonaute RISC catalytic component 2) is a pivotal protein in the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), playing a crucial role in RNA interference (RNAi) and microRNA (miRNA) pathways. It is the only Argonaute protein in mammals with catalytic activity, enabling it to cleave target mRNA, a process essential for gene silencing mediated by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (Liu2004Argonaute2; Meister2013Argonaute). AGO2 is involved in post-transcriptional gene silencing, including mRNA degradation and translational repression, by binding small RNAs and guiding them to complementary mRNA targets (Li2020AGO2).

In the cytoplasm, AGO2 facilitates the loading of small RNAs into RISC, with the help of proteins like Dicer and heat shock proteins, to regulate gene expression (Meister2013Argonaute). It also plays a role in mRNA decay and translational repression by interacting with eukaryotic initiation factors and other proteins to inhibit ribosomal loading and translation initiation (Li2020AGO2).

In the nucleus, AGO2 is involved in chromatin remodeling, transcriptional regulation, and DNA repair. It participates in transcriptional gene silencing by recruiting DNA methyltransferases and forming a heterochromatin environment, impacting processes like DNA replication and repair (Li2020AGO2). AGO2's functions are essential for maintaining genomic integrity and regulating gene expression in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AGO2 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in neurological development and cancer. Germline mutations in AGO2 are linked to various neurological disorders, including intellectual disability, motor and speech delays, and autism spectrum disorder features. These mutations impair RNA interference by affecting RISC formation and increasing AGO2's binding to mRNA targets, leading to global transcriptome changes in patient-derived fibroblasts (Lessel2020Germline). Specific mutations, such as p.G733R, result in a complete loss of function, affecting synaptic activity and potentially contributing to neurological abnormalities (Lessel2020Germline).

In cancer, AGO2 mutations and expression changes are associated with tumor progression. In gastric and colorectal cancers with high microsatellite instability (MSI-H), frameshift mutations and loss of AGO2 expression contribute to cancer development by disrupting miRNA regulation (Kim2010Somatic). In breast cancer, high AGO2 mRNA expression correlates with poor relapse-free survival, suggesting its role in cancer progression (Casey2019Quantifying). AGO2 also plays a role in colorectal cancer metastasis, where its reduced expression leads to increased cancer cell migration and invasion (Liu2021Impaired). These findings highlight the critical role of AGO2 in both neurological and oncological contexts.

## Interactions
AGO2, a member of the Argonaute protein family, is involved in numerous interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) activities. It interacts with Dicer and TRBP, facilitating the transfer of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into AGO proteins, and is involved in miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC) and siRNA-induced silencing complex (siRISC) (Höck2007Proteomic; Li2020AGO2). AGO2's PAZ domain binds the 3'-end of small RNAs, while the MID domain binds the 5' phosphates, influencing gene expression and miRNA biogenesis (Li2020AGO2).

AGO2 forms complexes with various proteins, including GW182, which recruits deadenylase complexes to target mRNAs, facilitating deadenylation and decapping (Li2020AGO2). It also interacts with proteins involved in chromatin remodeling, such as the SWI/SNF complex, and partners with LaminB to control chromatin architecture (Li2020AGO2). In DNA double-strand break repair, AGO2 associates with small RNAs and interacts with methyltransferase MMSET and acetyltransferase Tip60, promoting chromatin remodeling (Li2020AGO2).

AGO2 is part of a chromatin complex with SR proteins and hnRNPs, involved in splicing regulation, and interacts with proteins like PABPC1 and NUDT21 in alternative polyadenylation (Li2020AGO2). It also associates with ribosomal proteins, indicating a role in translational regulation (Höck2007Proteomic).
