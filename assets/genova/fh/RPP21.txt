# RPP21

## Overview
RPP21 is a gene that encodes the ribonuclease P/MRP subunit p21, a protein subunit of the human ribonuclease P (RNase P) complex. This complex is essential for the maturation of precursor tRNA molecules, a critical step in protein synthesis. The RPP21 protein is characterized by a zinc ribbon motif, which is common in nucleic acid-binding proteins, and plays a significant role in the structural and functional integrity of the RNase P complex. It interacts with other protein subunits, such as RPP29, and binds to H1 RNA, the RNA component of RNase P, to facilitate its catalytic activity. Beyond its canonical role in RNA processing, RPP21 is involved in the DNA damage response, particularly in the homology-directed repair of double-strand breaks, highlighting its importance in maintaining genomic integrity. The gene is also implicated in cancer-related processes, often being upregulated in various cancer types, which suggests a potential role in oncogenesis (Liu2021Comprehensive; Reiner2011RNA; AbuZhayia2017A).

## Structure
The RPP21 protein is characterized by a zinc ribbon motif in its C-terminal domain, which is common in nucleic acid-binding proteins. This motif includes a β-hairpin and four invariant cysteine residues (C63, C66, C92, and C95) essential for its function, as mutations in these cysteines lead to functional defects. The zinc ribbon motif is crucial for zinc coordination, and its structure is supported by conserved glycine residues (G73 and G96) that ensure proper folding (Samanta2016Sequence).

RPP21 also contains two long N-terminal α-helices stabilized by hydrophobic interactions involving conserved residues such as A14, V40, L21, Y39, and A43. These interactions are crucial for the structural stability of RPP21 and its binding to RPP29 (Samanta2016Sequence). The tertiary structure of the RPP21-RPP29 complex highlights conserved residues and structural elements that facilitate protein-protein interactions, such as a hydrophobic interaction between I71 in RPP29 and Y39 in RPP21, and an intermolecular salt bridge between E47 in RPP29 and R17 in RPP21 (Samanta2016Sequence).

Alternative splicing of the RPP21 gene can lead to the production of a variant protein, Rpp21i, which has a distinct carboxy terminus due to the insertion of 23 amino acids encoded by intron 1 (JARROUS2001Function).

## Function
RPP21 is a protein subunit of the human ribonuclease P (RNase P) complex, which is essential for the maturation of precursor tRNA molecules by cleaving their 5' leader sequences. This process is crucial for the proper synthesis of proteins in human cells (Reiner2011RNA). RPP21, along with Rpp29, is sufficient to reconstitute the endonucleolytic activity of RNase P, indicating its significant role in the enzyme's catalytic function (Reiner2011RNA). The protein is primarily localized in the nucleoplasm but can also be found in nucleoli and Cajal bodies, suggesting its involvement in dynamic nuclear processes (JARROUS2001Function).

RPP21 is also involved in the DNA damage response, particularly in the homology-directed repair of double-strand breaks. It is rapidly recruited to DNA damage sites, a process dependent on the presence of the catalytic H1 RNA subunit (AbuZhayia2017A). This recruitment highlights a non-canonical role for RPP21 in maintaining genomic integrity. The protein's interactions with H1 RNA and other subunits, such as Rpp29, are crucial for the structural assembly and function of RNase P, underscoring its importance in RNA processing and cellular homeostasis (Reiner2011RNA).

## Clinical Significance
The RPP21 gene, encoding a subunit of the human RNase P complex, has been implicated in various cancer-related processes. It is often upregulated in multiple cancer types, suggesting a potential role in oncogenesis (Liu2021Comprehensive). Hypomethylation of enhancer regions associated with RPP21 is linked to increased expression of the gene in tobacco-associated cancers, indicating that epigenetic alterations may contribute to its dysregulation in cancer (Liu2021Comprehensive). 

RPP21 is also involved in the homology-directed repair (HDR) of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA, a critical process for maintaining genomic stability. Its recruitment to DNA damage sites is facilitated by poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) moieties, with PARP1 playing a crucial role in this process (AbuZhayia2017A). Although overexpression of RPP21 does not directly affect HDR or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), its amplification in many cancers suggests a link between its expression and cancer progression (AbuZhayia2017A). 

Despite these associations, specific diseases or conditions directly resulting from RPP21 mutations or expression alterations are not well-documented. The gene's role in cancer and DNA repair highlights its potential significance in clinical research and therapeutic targeting (AbuZhayia2017A).

## Interactions
RPP21 is a protein subunit of the human ribonuclease P (RNase P) complex, which is involved in tRNA processing. It interacts with other protein subunits within the RNase P complex, such as RPP29, forming a binary complex that is crucial for the enzyme's function. This interaction is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and intermolecular salt bridges involving conserved residues like R17 and Y39 in RPP21 and E47 and I71 in RPP29 (Samanta2016Sequence).

RPP21 also binds to H1 RNA, the RNA component of RNase P, which is essential for its catalytic activity. This interaction is specific and involves binding to distinct regions of H1 RNA, as demonstrated by UV-crosslinking experiments and gel shift assays (Reiner2011RNA; JIANG2001Protein–RNA). RPP21, along with RPP29, is necessary for the cleavage of the 5' leader of precursor tRNA, highlighting its role in RNA processing (Reiner2011RNA).

The recruitment of RPP21 to DNA damage sites is facilitated by H1 RNA, which is crucial for the homology-directed repair of double-strand breaks. This recruitment is independent of RNA Pol II activity, emphasizing the specific role of RNA in this process (AbuZhayia2017A).
