# CRB2

## Overview
CRB2 is a gene that encodes the protein crumbs cell polarity complex component 2, which is a critical component of the Crumbs family of proteins. This protein is primarily involved in maintaining apicobasal polarity in epithelial cells, including those in the retina and kidney. CRB2 is characterized by its large extracellular domain, a single transmembrane region, and a short intracellular domain, which facilitate its role in cell adhesion and polarity. The protein is integral to the formation and maintenance of tight junctions and is involved in various cellular processes, including DNA repair and ciliogenesis. CRB2's interactions with other proteins, such as those in the γ-secretase complex, highlight its role in cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in diseases like Alzheimer's. Mutations in the CRB2 gene are associated with a spectrum of clinical conditions, including retinal dystrophies, nephrotic syndrome, and hydrocephalus, underscoring its significance in human health (Mitsuishi2010Human; Paniagua2021Key; Quinn2018CRB2).

## Structure
The CRB2 protein is a member of the Crumbs family, characterized by a large extracellular domain, a single transmembrane region, and a short intracellular domain. The extracellular domain includes epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like and laminin-A globular domains, contributing to its structural stability and interactions (Quinn2018CRB2). The intracellular domain contains a FERM protein binding motif and a C-terminal PDZ protein binding motif, which are crucial for interactions with PDZ-binding adaptor proteins like PALS1 and PAR6, facilitating the assembly of the CRB complex (Quinn2018CRB2).

CRB2 also contains tandem Tudor domains, which are involved in recognizing dimethylated histone H4-K20, similar to the 53BP1 protein. These domains have a conserved dimethyllysine-binding pocket, essential for its role in DNA repair (Botuyan2006Structural). The Crb2-BRCT2 domain forms a symmetric head-to-tail dimer, crucial for its function in DNA damage repair and checkpoint signaling. This dimerization is mediated by hydrophobic interactions and involves specific residues such as Ser666 and Cys663 (Kilkenny2008Structural).

CRB2 undergoes post-translational modifications, including potential glycosylation, which may influence its function and localization. The protein has multiple splice variants, resulting in different isoforms with distinct functional properties (Paniagua2015CRB2).

## Function
CRB2 is a crucial component of the Crumbs complex, which plays a significant role in maintaining apicobasal polarity in epithelial cells, including retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. This protein is essential for the formation and maintenance of tight junctions, which are integral to cell adhesion and the barrier function of epithelial tissues (Paniagua2021Key). CRB2 localizes to the apical membrane of cells and is involved in stabilizing apical polarity proteins, such as Par3 and Par6, which are important for the proliferation and survival of neuroepithelial cells (Boroviak2011The).

In the retina, CRB2 is part of the Crumbs complex that maintains the structure and function of the RPE and photoreceptors. It is involved in organizing protein scaffolds that regulate cell-cell communication and adhesion, crucial for photoreceptor polarity and function (Gosens2008Composition). CRB2 also plays a role in ciliogenesis, necessary for the elongation of photoreceptor inner segments and primary cilia in kidney cells (Stehle2024Human).

CRB2's function extends to inhibiting the γ-secretase cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is significant in preventing the pathological processes associated with Alzheimer's disease (Mitsuishi2010Human). Its proper function is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa and retinal dystrophies (Paniagua2021Key).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CRB2 gene are associated with a range of clinical conditions, primarily involving the kidneys and central nervous system. CRB2-related syndrome is characterized by elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels, cerebral ventriculomegaly, and renal findings similar to Finnish congenital nephrosis. Patients with this syndrome often present with hydrocephalus, aqueductal stenosis, and renal anomalies such as nephrotic syndrome and renal echogenicity (Lamont2016Expansion; Slavotinek2016The; Tessier2023Biallelic).

CRB2 mutations have been linked to steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, a kidney disorder marked by proteinuria and edema, often without other systemic findings (Simaab2022Exome). The gene is also implicated in non-communicating hydrocephalus due to atresia of the aqueduct of Sylvius and the central canal of the medulla, leading to cerebrospinal fluid accumulation and ventriculomegaly (Tessier2023Biallelic).

Ocular abnormalities, including retinal dystrophies and optic nerve issues, have been observed in some cases, although they are less frequent (Slavotinek2016The). The phenotypic spectrum of CRB2 mutations is broad, with variable expressivity, and may include cardiac defects, developmental delays, and other systemic manifestations (Lamont2016Expansion).

## Interactions
CRB2, a protein involved in maintaining cell polarity and adhesion, participates in several significant protein interactions. In the retina, CRB2 forms homo- and heteromeric complexes with CRB1, but not with CRB3, highlighting the importance of its extracellular domain for these interactions (Stehle2024Human). CRB2 is also part of a protein network that includes MPP5 and EPB41L5, linking the Crumbs complex to processes such as signaling, ciliary homeostasis, and cytoskeleton organization (Stehle2024Human).

CRB2 interacts with the γ-secretase complex, specifically binding to the PS1 (presenilin 1) subcomplex. This interaction suggests that CRB2 may inhibit γ-secretase activity, affecting the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein and reducing amyloid-beta peptide secretion (Mitsuishi2010Human).

In fission yeast, CRB2 interacts with proteins involved in DNA damage checkpoint control, such as Rad3, Chk1, and Cut5. These interactions are crucial for the activation of Chk1 and the establishment of the DNA damage checkpoint, with CRB2 acting as an adapter to facilitate Chk1 phosphorylation by Rad3 (Mochida2004Regulation). The interaction with Cut5 is essential for DNA repair, particularly under UV-induced damage conditions (Saka1997Damage).
