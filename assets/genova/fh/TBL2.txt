# TBL2

## Overview
TBL2 (transducin beta like 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in lipid metabolism and cellular signaling pathways. The TBL2 protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm and plays a significant role in regulating cholesterol and triglyceride levels within cells. It is categorized as a signaling protein due to its involvement in intracellular processes such as signal transduction and protein-protein interactions. TBL2 has been implicated in various metabolic disorders, including hyper-low-density lipoprotein cholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia, through its influence on lipid homeostasis. The gene's expression and methylation status have been linked to serum lipid profiles and associated with genetic variants that affect lipid metabolism. TBL2 interacts with several proteins, including TERE1 and APOE, which further underscores its role in cholesterol regulation and lipid metabolic pathways (Zeng2013Association; Blattmann2013RNAi–Based; Fredericks2011The).

## Structure


## Function
TBL2 (transducin beta like 2) is a gene implicated in the regulation of cholesterol metabolism and lipid homeostasis. The protein encoded by TBL2 is involved in cellular signaling pathways and is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it influences intracellular processes such as signal transduction and protein-protein interactions. Studies have shown that TBL2 plays a role in modulating cholesterol levels within cells. Knockdown of TBL2 results in increased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) concentration within endosomes and an increased free cholesterol load, suggesting a direct role in lipid regulation (Blattmann2013RNAi–Based). Overexpression and knockdown of TBL2 inversely affect cellular cholesterol levels, indicating its regulatory function in cholesterol metabolism (Blattmann2013RNAi–Based).

TBL2 is also associated with triglyceride metabolism, as evidenced by its involvement in the MLXIPL/TBL2 loci, which are linked to serum lipid levels (Zeng2013Association). The gene's methylation status has been studied in the context of hyper-low-density lipoprotein cholesterolemia, with higher methylation levels of TBL2 associated with a reduced risk of this condition, highlighting its potential protective role in lipid metabolism (Li2020TBL2).

## Clinical Significance
The TBL2 gene has been implicated in various metabolic disorders and conditions related to lipid metabolism. Alterations in TBL2 expression, particularly its methylation status, have been associated with hyper-low-density lipoprotein cholesterolemia (hyper-LDL). A study found that lower methylation levels of TBL2 were linked to an increased risk of hyper-LDL, suggesting that TBL2 methylation acts as a protective factor against this condition (Li2020TBL2).

Genetic variants of TBL2, such as the rs17145738 SNP, have been associated with different serum lipid profiles in various populations. In the Guangxi Mulao and Han populations, carriers of the T allele of this SNP exhibited altered levels of triglycerides and cholesterol, indicating a role in lipid metabolism and potential implications for coronary artery disease (Zeng2013Association).

TBL2 has also been linked to Fredrickson hyperlipoproteinemia phenotypes, particularly those characterized by hypertriglyceridemia. The TBL2 rs17145738 T dominant variant showed significant associations with several hyperlipoproteinemia types, highlighting its involvement in lipid disorders (Hegele2009A).

Additionally, TBL2's interaction with proteins involved in cholesterol regulation, such as TERE1, suggests its role in modulating cholesterol levels, although the precise mechanisms remain unclear (Fredericks2011The).

## Interactions
TBL2 (transducin beta like 2) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with TERE1 (also known as UBIAD1), a protein implicated in cholesterol regulation and tumor progression. This interaction suggests a role in modulating cellular cholesterol levels, as both proteins have been shown to affect cholesterol homeostasis (Fredericks2011The).

TBL2 also binds to APOE, a cholesterol carrier, indicating its involvement in lipid metabolism (Fredericks2011The). The protein is associated with triglyceride metabolism disorders and has been identified as a candidate gene in such conditions (Fredericks2011The).

In response to oxidative DNA damage, TBL2 undergoes phosphorylation at T433 by ATM/ATR, suggesting its participation in the cellular oxidative damage response network (Fredericks2011The). It also interacts with PDK1, implying a potential role in AKT signaling pathways (Fredericks2011The).

These interactions highlight TBL2's involvement in complex cellular signaling networks, particularly those related to lipid metabolism and stress responses. The precise mechanisms and effects of these interactions remain areas of active research.
