# OAZ2

## Overview
The OAZ2 gene encodes the protein ornithine decarboxylase antizyme 2, which plays a critical role in the regulation of polyamine biosynthesis. As a regulatory protein, OAZ2 functions by binding to and inhibiting ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), a key enzyme in the polyamine synthesis pathway, thereby promoting its degradation and maintaining cellular polyamine levels (Zhang2022Ornithine). This regulation is essential for cellular homeostasis and has implications in tumor suppression, as dysregulated polyamine levels can contribute to tumorigenesis (Zhang2022Ornithine). OAZ2 is also involved in a network of protein-protein interactions that influence cellular growth and metabolism, highlighting its broader role in cellular regulation (Qiu2017Antizyme; Zhang2022Ornithine). The gene's expression levels have been linked to clinical outcomes in various cancers, including neuroblastoma and colon cancer, where it serves as a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Geerts2010The; Li2018miR34a).

## Structure
The OAZ2 protein in the Sichuan white goose has a molecular formula of C945H1476N252O282S9 and a molecular mass of 21.17 kDa. Its primary structure includes two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), with ORF1 encoding a 32 amino acid polypeptide and ORF2 encoding a 158 amino acid polypeptide (He2014Molecular). The secondary structure of OAZ2 consists of 25.79% α-helix, 18.95% extended strand, 4.74% β-turn, and 50.53% random coil (He2014Molecular). 

The protein contains specific domains, including an amino acid sequence domain from Pro11 to Leu181, a label from Leu122 to Met130, and a protein prenyltransferases alpha subunit repeat profile from Ser186 to Glu190 (He2014Molecular). OAZ2 has twelve putative phosphorylation sites, including nine serine residues, one threonine residue, and two tyrosine residues, indicating potential post-translational modifications (He2014Molecular). Additionally, one putative N-glycosylation site is identified between amino-acid positions 99 and 184 (He2014Molecular). The protein's instability coefficient is 46.77, suggesting it may be unstable, and its average hydrophobicity is -0.275 (He2014Molecular). Information on the tertiary and quaternary structures is not provided in the available context.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the OAZ2 gene have been linked to various clinical outcomes, particularly in cancer. In neuroblastoma, a pediatric cancer, high expression of OAZ2 is associated with favorable prognosis and increased survival rates. Conversely, low OAZ2 expression correlates with poor prognosis and aggressive tumor behavior. This is particularly evident in neuroblastomas without MYCN amplification, where high OAZ2 expression is linked to better survival outcomes (Geerts2010The). OAZ2 expression is also significantly lower in tumors with MYCN amplification, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic marker (Geerts2010The).

In colon cancer, the interaction between miR-34a and OAZ2 is crucial in regulating multidrug resistance (MDR). miR-34a positively modulates OAZ2 signaling, and its downregulation is associated with increased drug resistance. Overexpression of OAZ2 enhances chemosensitivity, indicating that alterations in OAZ2 expression can impact treatment outcomes in colon cancer (Li2018miR34a). These findings highlight the clinical significance of OAZ2 in cancer prognosis and therapy, suggesting that it could be a target for therapeutic interventions. However, specific mutations in the OAZ2 gene and their direct clinical implications are not extensively documented in the provided context.

## Interactions
Ornithine decarboxylase antizyme 2 (OAZ2) is involved in the regulation of polyamine biosynthesis by interacting with ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), a key enzyme in this pathway. OAZ2 binds to ODC, inhibiting its activity and promoting its degradation, which helps control polyamine levels within the cell (Zhang2022Ornithine). This interaction is crucial for its role as a tumor suppressor, as it prevents excessive polyamine accumulation that can lead to tumorigenesis (Zhang2022Ornithine).

Protein-protein interaction analysis has identified several genes closely related to OAZ2 expression, including PSMD12, PSMA1, PSMC3, PSMA3, PSMAS, OAZ3, OAZ1, ODC1, PSME2, and AZIN1 (Zhang2022Ornithine). These interactions suggest that OAZ2 may be part of a larger network of proteins involved in polyamine metabolism and cellular growth regulation. The interaction with AZIN1, in particular, highlights a regulatory mechanism where AZIN1 can bind to antizymes like OAZ2, potentially modulating their inhibitory effects on ODC and influencing polyamine synthesis (Qiu2017Antizyme).

These interactions underscore the importance of OAZ2 in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential role in cancer prognosis, particularly in colon adenocarcinoma (Zhang2022Ornithine).
