# CRY2

## Overview
CRY2, or cryptochrome circadian regulator 2, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the cryptochrome family, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of circadian rhythms in mammals. The CRY2 protein functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor within the circadian clock, influencing sleep-wake cycles and other physiological processes. It is characterized by a photolyase-homology region and a C-terminal extension, which are crucial for its interaction with other molecular components of the circadian machinery (Nangle2014Molecular). CRY2 forms part of a feedback loop that involves the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer and the Period (Per) and Cryptochrome (Cry) genes, maintaining the circadian rhythm through complex protein-protein interactions (Hirano2016A). Beyond its role in circadian regulation, CRY2 is implicated in various biological processes, including mood regulation and cancer, highlighting its broader physiological significance (Hirano2016A; Hoffman2009Clock-Cancer).

## Structure
The CRY2 protein, a component of the cryptochrome family, exhibits a complex molecular structure. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a photolyase-homology region (PHR) and a C-terminal extension (CCE) (Nangle2014Molecular). The secondary structure includes an α/β photolyase domain and an α-helical domain (Nangle2014Molecular). The tertiary structure of CRY2 features a conserved FAD-binding pocket within the C-terminal α-helical domain, which is crucial for its function and interaction with other molecules like KL001 and FBXL3 (Nangle2013Crystal; Nangle2014Molecular).

CRY2 can form quaternary structures, such as homodimers or heterodimers, which are important for its role in circadian rhythm regulation (Nangle2014Molecular). The protein also undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which may influence its activity and stability (Nangle2014Molecular). The presence of splice variant isoforms contributes to the functional diversity of CRY2, allowing it to participate in various biological processes (Nangle2014Molecular). The structural plasticity of CRY2 is essential for its differential binding and regulation, highlighting its adaptability in cellular functions (Nangle2014Molecular).

## Function
CRY2 (cryptochrome circadian regulator 2) is a crucial component of the mammalian circadian clock, functioning primarily as a transcriptional repressor in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in regulating sleep-wake cycles by inhibiting E-box-regulated gene expression. CRY2 is part of a feedback loop where the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer activates the expression of Period (Per) and Cryptochrome (Cry) genes. The translated PER and CRY proteins form a complex that inhibits their own transcription, thus maintaining the circadian rhythm (Hirano2016A).

CRY2's stability is regulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and ubiquitylation, with FBXL3, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, promoting its degradation. This regulation is essential for maintaining the circadian period (Hirano2016A). The protein is primarily active in the nucleus, where it interacts with CLOCK and BMAL1 to inhibit transcription, closing the negative feedback loop crucial for circadian rhythm maintenance (Reppert2002Coordination).

CRY2 also influences other physiological processes, such as mood regulation, cancer, and glucose homeostasis, although specific associations with circadian phenotypes have not been fully described (Hirano2016A). Its role in the circadian clock is independent of light, unlike its function in plants and insects (Reppert2001Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CRY2 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In cancer research, CRY2 has been associated with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Studies have shown that silencing CRY2 can lead to the upregulation of genes involved in cell growth and angiogenesis, such as Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGFC), which may influence tumorigenesis and immune response (Hoffman2009Clock-Cancer). Genetic variants in CRY2 have also been linked to an increased risk of NHL, suggesting its role as a potential tumor suppressor (Hoffman2009Clock-Cancer).

In the realm of mood disorders, CRY2 genetic variants have been associated with dysthymia and major depressive disorder (MDD). Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CRY2 are linked to dysthymia, with certain alleles predisposing individuals to this condition (Kovanen2013CRY2). The gene has also been connected to winter depression, a subtype of seasonal affective disorder, with certain SNPs increasing the risk of this condition (Lavebratt2010CRY2).

CRY2 mutations can also affect circadian rhythms, as seen in Familial Advanced Sleep Phase (FASP), where a specific mutation leads to altered sleep-wake cycles (Hirano2016A). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CRY2 in various health conditions.

## Interactions
CRY2, a core component of the circadian clock, participates in several critical protein-protein interactions that regulate circadian rhythms. In mammals, CRY2 interacts with PER2 to form a complex that translocates into the nucleus, where it negatively regulates the transcription of core clock genes by inhibiting the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer (Langmesser2008Interaction; Ozber2010Identification). Specific amino acids in the C-terminal domain of CRY2, such as Arg-501 and Lys-503, are essential for its interaction with PER2 (Ozber2010Identification).

CRY2 also interacts with BMAL1, with a higher affinity than PER2, suggesting a significant role in modulating BMAL1-CLOCK-mediated transcription (Langmesser2008Interaction). Mutations in CRY2, such as G351D and G354D, affect its ability to bind to CLOCK-BMAL1 and PER proteins, impacting its repressive function and circadian rhythm regulation (McCarthy2009Generation).

In plants, CRY2 interacts with CIB1 in a blue light-dependent manner, which is crucial for regulating transcription and floral initiation (Liu2008Photoexcited). This interaction highlights the diverse roles of CRY2 in different organisms, from circadian regulation in mammals to light-responsive processes in plants.
