# YARS2

## Overview
The YARS2 gene encodes the mitochondrial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase 2 (mtTyrRS), a crucial enzyme within the family of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. This enzyme is responsible for the aminoacylation of tRNA^Tyr, a fundamental process in mitochondrial protein synthesis, which is essential for the proper functioning of the oxidative phosphorylation system and cellular energy production (Tyynismaa2012Mitochondrial). The YARS2 protein is characterized by its catalytic domain, which is highly conserved among vertebrates, and it functions as a dimer to maintain its structural and functional integrity (Jiang2015The). Mutations in the YARS2 gene can lead to mitochondrial disorders, such as Myopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Sideroblastic Anemia 2 (MLASA2), highlighting its clinical significance (Riley2013Phenotypic). The gene's role extends beyond its enzymatic activity, potentially involving interactions with other mitochondrial components to ensure efficient protein synthesis and tRNA stability (Peng2022RNA).

## Structure
The YARS2 gene encodes the mitochondrial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, a protein involved in the aminoacylation of tRNA with tyrosine. The primary structure of YARS2 consists of 477 amino acids, including a 16-amino acid mitochondrial targeting signal (Jiang2015The). The secondary structure features include α-helices, with a notable Gly-Gly motif at the C-terminal end of a short α-helix, which is crucial for maintaining the structural scaffold of the protein (Jiang2015The).

The tertiary structure of YARS2 forms a three-dimensional shape necessary for its function, with a catalytic domain that is highly conserved among vertebrates. This domain is essential for the enzyme's activity and stability (Jiang2015The). The quaternary structure involves the dimerization of YARS2 molecules, which is necessary for its function. Mutations, such as the p.191Gly>Val, can disrupt this dimeric form, affecting the protein's stability and function (Jiang2015The).

YARS2 contains specific domains, including the catalytic domain, which is involved in the enzyme's aminoacylation activity. The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. Splice variant isoforms of YARS2 could result in different functional or regulatory properties, but specific isoforms are not mentioned in the context.

## Function
The YARS2 gene encodes the mitochondrial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (mtTyrRS), an enzyme essential for mitochondrial protein synthesis. In healthy human cells, mtTyrRS is responsible for the aminoacylation of tRNA^Tyr, a critical step in the translation of mitochondrial DNA-encoded proteins. This enzyme recognizes and stabilizes the amino acid-accepting helix of tRNA^Tyr, facilitating the attachment of tyrosine to its corresponding tRNA. This process is crucial for the proper synthesis of mitochondrial proteins, which are components of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes, essential for cellular energy production (Tyynismaa2012Mitochondrial).

YARS2 plays a significant role in mitochondrial translation, particularly in the pseudouridylation of tRNA^Tyr, which is vital for normal cellular function and energy production (Diodato2014The). The enzyme's activity ensures efficient mitochondrial translation and energy production, impacting cellular respiration and overall organismal energy metabolism (Tyynismaa2012Mitochondrial). Additionally, mt-aaRSs, including YARS2, may have roles beyond their enzymatic function, such as acting as chaperones to protect tRNAs from degradation, ensuring the quality control of the tRNA pool within mitochondria (Diodato2014The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the YARS2 gene are associated with a mitochondrial disorder known as Myopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Sideroblastic Anemia 2 (MLASA2). This condition is characterized by a combination of muscle weakness, lactic acidosis, and sideroblastic anemia, resulting from impaired mitochondrial function. The phenotypic expression of YARS2 mutations is highly variable, with differences in age of onset and severity of symptoms among patients. For instance, the p.Phe52Leu mutation has been identified in patients with varying clinical severity, ranging from severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in infancy to mild myopathy and anemia in adulthood (Riley2013Phenotypic).

Other mutations, such as p.Gly191Asp and p.Arg360X, have been shown to significantly impact mitochondrial function by reducing catalytic efficiency and causing mRNA instability, respectively. These mutations lead to deficiencies in respiratory chain complexes, particularly in muscle tissue, which has higher energy demands (Riley2013Phenotypic). The clinical presentation of MLASA2 can also include additional symptoms like pancreatic insufficiency, as seen in cases with novel YARS2 variants (CarreñoGago2021Two). The presence of YARS2 mutations is most commonly reported in certain populations, including those of Lebanese descent (Shahni2013A; Sasarman2012A).

## Interactions
YARS2, the mitochondrial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, is involved in interactions that are crucial for its function in mitochondrial translation. While specific interactions of YARS2 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed, it is known that YARS2 mutations can lead to significant phenotypic effects, suggesting its involvement in complex cellular networks (Schwenzer2013Pathogenic). The F52L mutation in YARS2, for instance, affects mitochondrial translation in skeletal muscle but not in fibroblasts, indicating tissue-specific interactions or dependencies (Schwenzer2013Pathogenic).

YARS2 is part of the broader family of mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (mt-aaRSs), which are known to form complexes that enhance tRNA charging efficiency and facilitate mitochondrial mRNA translation (Peng2022RNA). Although specific interactions of YARS2 within these complexes are not detailed, the general role of mt-aaRSs in forming multi-synthetase complexes suggests that YARS2 may participate in similar interactions (Peng2022RNA). These complexes are crucial for maintaining the efficiency of mitochondrial protein synthesis and may involve interactions with mitochondrial ribosome proteins and other components of the translation machinery (Peng2022RNA).
