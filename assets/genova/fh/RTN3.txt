# RTN3

## Overview
RTN3 is a gene that encodes the protein reticulon 3, a member of the reticulon family, which is primarily associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Reticulon 3 is a transmembrane protein characterized by its reticulon homology domain (RHD), which plays a crucial role in shaping the ER's tubular structure and maintaining its homeostasis (Yang2007The; Di2012The). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including vesicle trafficking, endosome maturation, and ER-phagy, highlighting its importance in cellular homeostasis and neuroprotection (Chen2020Reticulon; Wu2021Reticulon3). RTN3's interactions with other proteins, such as Bcl-2 and viral components, further underscore its multifaceted role in both cellular and viral contexts (Zhu2007Anti‐apoptotic; Li2020Reticulon3). Alterations in RTN3 expression or function have been linked to diseases such as Alzheimer's and chronic kidney disease, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Fan2022Loss; Shi2009Reduced).

## Structure
RTN3, a member of the reticulon family, is characterized by a conserved reticulon homology domain (RHD) located near its C-terminus. This domain consists of two unusually long hydrophobic regions, each spanning approximately 30-35 amino acids, which are separated by a hydrophilic loop of 60-70 amino acids (Yang2007The; Di2012The). These hydrophobic regions form a hairpin-like structure within the membrane, contributing to the protein's role in shaping the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Di2012The). The RHD is highly conserved across eukaryotic species, indicating its importance in cellular functions (Yang2007The).

RTN3 exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, ranging from 19 kDa to 105 kDa, with the smallest form, RTN3C, containing only the RHD (Chang2009Reticulon). The protein can undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its function and interactions (Chang2009Reticulon). RTN3 also contains six active LC3-interacting region (LIR) domains in its N-terminal region, which are essential for its role in ER-phagy (D’Eletto2020Reticulon). The N-terminal regions of RTN3 show little sequence homology, allowing for interactions with distinct proteins and conferring specific biological functions to different isoforms (Di2012The).

## Function
Reticulon-3 (RTN3) is a protein primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plays a significant role in maintaining ER structure and function. RTN3 is involved in shaping the tubular ER and generating membrane curvature, which is crucial for various cellular processes, including vesicle trafficking and maintaining ER homeostasis (Chen2020Reticulon; Wu2021Reticulon3). It is particularly important in endosome maturation at ER membrane contact sites (MCSs), where it regulates cargo sorting and endosome trafficking (Wu2021Reticulon3).

RTN3 is recruited to ER-endosome MCSs by Rab9a, facilitating the transition of endosomes from early to late stages, which is essential for proper endosomal function and cargo trafficking (Wu2021Reticulon3). The protein also plays a role in ER-phagy, a process that degrades misfolded protein aggregates, thereby protecting the ER membrane integrity during stress conditions (Chen2020Reticulon). RTN3's involvement in these processes highlights its critical function in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential impact on neuroprotective functions (Di2012The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the RTN3 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), RTN3 is identified as a negative modulator of BACE1, an enzyme involved in the production of β-amyloid peptide, a key component of amyloid plaques. Overexpression of RTN3 in transgenic mice has been shown to reduce amyloid deposition in the cerebral cortex, although preformed RTN3 aggregates in dystrophic neurites can offset this reduction by affecting BACE1 activity (Shi2009Reduced). RTN3 is also enriched in dystrophic neurites associated with amyloid plaques in AD brains, suggesting a significant role in the disease's pathology (Shi2017RTN1).

In the context of chronic kidney disease (CKD), RTN3 deficiency in mice has been shown to phenocopy CKD, leading to kidney fibrosis and dysfunction. This is associated with the activation of the IGF2-JAK2-STAT3 pathway, which affects collagen synthesis and mitochondrial function. RTN3-null mice exhibit increased collagen synthesis and mitochondrial dysfunction, contributing to CKD progression (Fan2022Loss). Reduced RTN3 expression in human CKD patients correlates with disease progression, indicating its potential role in kidney disease pathogenesis (Fan2022Loss).

## Interactions
RTN3 (reticulon 3) is involved in several protein interactions that influence various cellular processes. It interacts with heat shock protein family A (Hsp70) member 5 (HSPA5), also known as BIP/GRP78, in mouse fat tissue. This interaction is significant in the context of obesity and hypertriglyceridemia, as it affects the stabilization of the SREBP-SCAP complex, crucial for triglyceride lipid synthesis (Xiang2018Increased). RTN3 also interacts with Bcl-2 proteins, forming a stable complex on the endoplasmic reticulum, which enhances Bcl-2's anti-apoptotic activity (Zhu2007Anti‐apoptotic).

In the context of viral infections, RTN3 interacts with double-stranded HCV RNA and the HCV NS3 protein, playing a role in the loading of viral molecules into exosomes (Li2020Reticulon3). It also interacts with RIG-I and TRIM25, negatively regulating antiviral responses by impairing TRIM25-mediated K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIG-I, which is essential for RIG-I signalosome activation (Yang2021RTN3). Additionally, RTN3.1A, a variant of RTN3, interacts with the flavivirus NS4A protein, facilitating membrane remodeling necessary for viral replication (Aktepe2017The). These interactions highlight RTN3's role in both cellular and viral processes.
