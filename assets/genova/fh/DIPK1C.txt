# DIPK1C

## Overview
DIPK1C is a gene that encodes the protein divergent protein kinase domain 1C, which is categorized as a kinase due to its involvement in phosphorylation processes. This protein plays a significant role in various cellular pathways, influencing cell signaling and regulatory mechanisms. The expression and function of DIPK1C have been studied in the context of several diseases, particularly in cancer biology. Alterations in DIPK1C expression have been linked to treatment responses and disease progression in pediatric B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and glioblastoma, among others. The gene's involvement in these conditions underscores its potential as a biomarker for disease prognosis and a target for therapeutic interventions (Huang2021Subgrouping; Li2024The; PinarbasiDegirmenci2022Chronically).

## Clinical Significance
The gene DIPK1C has been implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In pediatric B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), particularly in subgroup I, there is a positive correlation between DIPK1C expression and minimal residual disease (MRD) positivity or slow early response (SER). This suggests that DIPK1C may play a role in pathways fundamental to treatment response in this subgroup (Huang2021Subgrouping). The gene's expression is also associated with outcomes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), although its relevance to ALL, especially the TCF3-PBX1 subtype, remains controversial (Huang2021Subgrouping).

In glioblastoma, DIPK1C is among the top downregulated genes in cell lines that have survived chronic radiation exposure. This downregulation is part of the adaptive gene expression changes that occur in response to radiation, potentially contributing to tumor recurrence (PinarbasiDegirmenci2022Chronically).

Additionally, the CYB5A-DIPK1C fusion gene has been identified in pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), although the clinical significance of this fusion remains unclear (Li2024The). These findings highlight the potential role of DIPK1C in cancer biology and its possible implications in treatment resistance and disease progression.
