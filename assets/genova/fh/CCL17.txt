# CCL17

## Overview
CCL17 is a gene that encodes the protein C-C motif chemokine ligand 17, also known as thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC). This protein is a member of the chemokine family, which plays a pivotal role in the immune system by mediating the migration and activation of immune cells. CCL17 is primarily expressed in the thymus, dendritic cells, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts, and it functions as a ligand for the CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4), a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) (Chensue2001Molecular; Hugander2008Quantification). Through its interaction with CCR4, CCL17 is involved in the recruitment of Th2-type cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs), contributing to immune surveillance, homeostasis, and the modulation of immune responses, particularly in inflammatory contexts (Nakayama2004Selective; Snodgrass2018A). The gene's expression and the protein's function are critical in various physiological and pathological processes, including tissue repair, immune balance, and disease pathogenesis.

## Structure


## Function
CCL17, also known as thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC), is a chemokine involved in the regulation of immune responses. It is primarily expressed in the thymus, dendritic cells, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts, where it plays a crucial role in lymphocyte homing and the development of lymphoid tissues (Chensue2001Molecular; Hugander2008Quantification). CCL17 functions as a ligand for the CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4), attracting CCR4+ cells, which include Th2-type cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs) (Hugander2008Quantification). This interaction is significant for maintaining immune balance and facilitating the migration of T cells to sites of inflammation or tissue injury.

In healthy human cells, CCL17 is involved in the attraction of Th2 cells and regulatory T cells, contributing to immune surveillance and homeostasis (Nakayama2004Selective). The chemokine is implicated in the modulation of immune responses, particularly in the context of inflammation and tissue repair. Its expression is regulated by various cytokines, including IL-4, which enhances CCL17 production in macrophages, indicating its role in Th2-mediated immune responses (Snodgrass2018A). CCL17's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining immune system function and homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CCL17 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), CCL17 expression is significantly decreased in tumor tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues, suggesting a potential role in immune infiltration and prognosis. High CCL17 expression is associated with better overall survival and progression-free survival in early-stage LUAD patients, indicating its value as a prognostic marker (Ye2022Chemokine).

In the context of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive tumors, such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma and gastric carcinoma, elevated levels of CCL17 are linked to the recruitment of regulatory T cells, contributing to immune evasion by the tumor. This suggests that CCL17 plays a role in the tumor microenvironment by promoting an immunosuppressive state (Jorapur2022EBV+).

In nasal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (NNKTL), CCL17 is produced at higher levels in EBV-positive cell lines, and its receptor CCR4 is expressed on these cells. Targeting the CCL17/CCR4 axis with monoclonal antibodies has shown potential as a therapeutic strategy, indicating the involvement of CCL17 in the pathogenesis of NNKTL (Kumai2015CCL17).

In intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), CCL17 expression increases post-ICH and is involved in attenuating neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis, suggesting a protective role in this condition (Deng2021Recombinant).

## Interactions
CCL17, also known as thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC), primarily interacts with the CCR4 receptor, a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) on T-cells. This interaction is crucial for CCL17's role in immune signaling and inflammatory responses. CCL17 requires the engagement of two distinct binding domains to effectively signal through CCR4, differentiating its mechanism from that of CCL22, which shares the CCR4 receptor but utilizes a common binding site (SantulliMarotto2013Engagement).

The interaction between CCL17 and CCR4 involves the recruitment of b-arrestin, a protein that regulates GPCR signaling. This recruitment is essential for CCL17-mediated signaling and can be inhibited by specific antibodies that target CCL17, such as B225 and B202. These antibodies have been shown to block CCL17-mediated b-arrestin recruitment and chemotaxis of T cells, highlighting their potential to modulate immune responses by interfering with CCL17's interaction with CCR4 (SantulliMarotto2013Engagement).

CCL17 also interacts with surrogate antibodies that specifically bind and neutralize it without affecting CCL22. These antibodies inhibit CCL17-mediated calcium mobilization and chemotaxis, further demonstrating their antagonistic activity in blocking CCL17 signaling through CCR4 (SantulliMarotto2013Surrogate).
