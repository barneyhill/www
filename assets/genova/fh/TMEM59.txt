# TMEM59

## Overview
TMEM59 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 59, a type I transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes, including Wnt/β-catenin signaling, autophagy, and glycosylation. The protein is characterized by a signal peptide, a transmembrane domain, and a putative N-glycosylation site, which are essential for its functional roles in cellular signaling and protein interactions (Gerlach2018TMEM59; Ullrich2010The). TMEM59 enhances Wnt signaling by facilitating the assembly of Wnt signalosomes, thereby amplifying the signaling pathway (Gerlach2018TMEM59). Additionally, it plays a role in autophagy through a novel ATG16L1-binding motif that promotes LC3 activation (BoadaRomero2013TMEM59). TMEM59 is also involved in modulating glycosylation processes in the Golgi apparatus, impacting the processing and trafficking of the amyloid precursor protein, which is relevant to neurodegenerative diseases (Ullrich2010The). The protein's interactions with other transmembrane proteins, such as TREM2, further underscore its significance in neuroinflammatory processes and potential implications in Alzheimer's disease pathology (Liu2020TMEM59).

## Structure
TMEM59 is a type I transmembrane protein characterized by a signal peptide, a transmembrane domain, and a putative N-glycosylation site (Ullrich2010The). The transmembrane domain is the only known functional domain, and it plays a crucial role in the protein's ability to potentiate Wnt signaling by mediating interactions with Wnt receptors such as FZD5 (Gerlach2018TMEM59). The protein is glycosylated, with N-glycosylation occurring at amino acid 90, which contributes to its molecular mass being slightly higher than its calculated mass (Ullrich2010The).

TMEM59 contains a minimal 19-amino-acid subdomain between amino acids 263 and 281, which is necessary for its autophagic activity. This subdomain is crucial for the activation of LC3, a key protein in the autophagy process (BoadaRomero2013TMEM59). The protein also features a novel ATG16L1-binding motif, which includes a pattern of critical amino acids (Y268, E272, Y277, and L280) necessary for its function in autophagy (BoadaRomero2013TMEM59).

TMEM59 is highly conserved between humans and mice, showing 93.8% identity and 97.2% similarity, and shares 32% identity with its human homolog TMEM59L (Ullrich2010The). The protein is predominantly found in vertebrates, with orthologs present in some insects (Ullrich2010The).

## Function
TMEM59 is a type I transmembrane protein involved in several key cellular processes. It plays a significant role in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for development, tissue homeostasis, and stem cell maintenance. TMEM59 enhances Wnt signaling by promoting the formation of multimeric Wnt-FZD assemblies through intramembrane interactions, facilitating the assembly of mature Wnt signalosomes. These complexes increase the local concentration of signaling proteins, thereby amplifying the signaling pathway and stabilizing β-catenin, which is essential for activating target gene expression (Gerlach2018TMEM59).

TMEM59 also influences autophagy, a cellular degradation process, by promoting the local activation of LC3, a protein involved in autophagy. It contains a novel ATG16L1-binding motif necessary for LC3 lipidation and activation, suggesting its role in engaging the autophagic machinery (BoadaRomero2013TMEM59).

In the Golgi apparatus, TMEM59 modulates glycosylation processes, affecting the glycosylation and cell surface expression of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). This modulation impacts APP processing and trafficking, potentially influencing pathways related to neurodegenerative diseases (Ullrich2010The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in TMEM59 expression have been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebral ischemic stroke. In Alzheimer's disease, TMEM59 overexpression has been associated with increased amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaque deposition and neurite dystrophy, contributing to cognitive deficits and impaired synaptic plasticity. Conversely, TMEM59 haploinsufficiency has been shown to reduce Aβ deposition and ameliorate memory and synaptic deficits in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD, suggesting that TMEM59 plays a detrimental role in AD pathology (Meng2020TMEM59).

In the context of cerebral ischemic stroke, TMEM59 expression is significantly reduced, particularly in microglial cells. TMEM59 knockout mice exhibit worsened ischemic brain damage, characterized by increased infarction volume, neurological deficits, and neuronal death. This is linked to enhanced microglial activation, pyroptosis, and neuroinflammation. TMEM59 appears to have a protective role against ischemic stroke by modulating microglial activation and inflammatory responses, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target for managing ischemic stroke (Zhang2021TMEM59).

Additionally, TMEM59 interacts with TREM2, a receptor involved in microglial functions. Alterations in TMEM59 expression can affect TREM2-dependent microglial activities, which are crucial in neurodegenerative diseases (Liu2020TMEM59).

## Interactions
TMEM59 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It interacts with TREM2, a type I transmembrane protein, through their transmembrane domains. This interaction is specific, as TMEM59 does not interact with another type I transmembrane protein, CSF1R. The interaction between TMEM59 and TREM2 is crucial for modulating microglial activities, impacting neuroinflammation and potentially Alzheimer's disease pathology (Liu2020TMEM59).

In the context of Wnt signaling, TMEM59 interacts with Wnt receptors, specifically FZD5 and FZD4, and the coreceptor LRP6. These interactions facilitate the formation of signalosomes, enhancing Wnt signaling. TMEM59 promotes the multimerization of FZD receptors, which is essential for the assembly of mature Wnt signalosomes (Gerlach2018TMEM59).

TMEM59 also plays a role in autophagy by interacting with ATG16L1. It contains a novel ATG16L1-binding motif that promotes local activation of LC3, a key protein in autophagy. This interaction is crucial for the autophagic targeting of membranous compartments, particularly during bacterial infections (BoadaRomero2013TMEM59).
