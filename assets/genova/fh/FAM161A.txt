# FAM161A

## Overview
FAM161A is a gene that encodes the FAM161 centrosomal protein A, a crucial component involved in the organization and stabilization of microtubules, particularly within the retina. This protein is categorized as a centrosomal protein due to its role in microtubule-organizing centers, impacting cellular processes such as cell division and intracellular transport. The FAM161A protein is characterized by a conserved C-terminal UPF0564 domain, which facilitates its binding to microtubules and interaction with other proteins, thereby playing a significant role in the assembly and stability of the primary cilium in photoreceptor cells (Beryozkin2021A; Zach2012The). Mutations in the FAM161A gene are linked to autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa, a degenerative eye disease that leads to progressive vision loss, underscoring the gene's clinical significance in retinal health (Beryozkin2020Unique; Bandah-Rozenfeld2010Homozygosity).

## Structure
The FAM161A protein is characterized by the presence of a conserved C-terminal UPF0564 domain, which is crucial for its binding to microtubules and mediating protein-protein interactions (Zach2012The). This domain is composed of approximately 400 amino acid residues and is highly conserved across various eukaryotic species (Zach2012The). The UPF0564 domain includes three stretches of 22-28 amino acid residues predicted to form α-helical structures, which are important for homotypic interactions (Zach2012The). The N-terminal part of this domain is predicted to have right-handed α-helices, which are crucial for protein interaction (Zach2012The).

FAM161A has two major isoforms, resulting from alternative splicing, with lengths of 660 and 716 amino acids. These isoforms have similar expression profiles, particularly in the retina and testis (Zach2012The). The long isoform contains an alternatively spliced exon 3a, inserted in the C-terminal part of the UPF0564 domain (Zach2012The). The protein's role in microtubule stability is associated with increased acetylation of α-tubulin, a post-translational modification linked to stable microtubule assemblies (Zach2012The).

## Function
The FAM161A gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the retina, particularly within the photoreceptor sensory cilium complex. This protein is localized at the base of the photoreceptor connecting cilium, as well as in the synaptic regions of the outer and inner plexiform layers and ganglion cells (Beryozkin2021A; Sahel2023Gene). FAM161A is involved in the stabilization of existing microtubules and the assembly of the primary cilium in cell cultures. It binds directly to microtubules, increasing the acetylation of α-tubulin, which is crucial for microtubule stability (Beryozkin2021A). The protein contains a highly conserved domain, UPF0564, which mediates microtubule association and interaction with other proteins, allowing it to bind to over 50 other ciliary proteins, such as LCA5 and CEP290 (Beryozkin2021A). These interactions are essential for maintaining the structure and function of photoreceptors, which are critical for vision. The FAM161A protein is also part of the microtubule-organizing centers, contributing to the organization and stability of the centrosome, impacting cellular processes like cell division and intracellular transport (Beryozkin2020Unique).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FAM161A gene are primarily associated with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP), a degenerative eye disease characterized by progressive vision loss. This condition is marked by night blindness, constriction of visual fields, and eventual loss of central vision, often leading to blindness. Clinical features include moderate to high myopia, bone spicule-like pigmentary changes, and non-detectable full-field electroretinography responses (Beryozkin2020Unique; Bandah-Rozenfeld2010Homozygosity). 

FAM161A mutations are a significant cause of arRP in the Israeli and Palestinian populations, accounting for approximately 12% to 20% of cases in these regions (Beryozkin2020Unique; Bandah-Rozenfeld2010Homozygosity). The gene is also implicated in retinal degenerations in other ethnic groups, including Indian, Middle Eastern, North African, and European populations (Beryozkin2021A; Rose2015Diverse).

The FAM161A protein is involved in the stabilization and assembly of the primary cilium in photoreceptor cells, and its dysfunction leads to retinal ciliopathy (Beryozkin2021A). The gene interacts with several other proteins associated with retinal degenerations, such as POC1B and CEP290, highlighting its role in retinal and multisystem disorders (Rose2015Diverse).

## Interactions
FAM161A is involved in several physical interactions crucial for its role in microtubule organization and stabilization. It directly binds to microtubules, enhancing the acetylation of α-tubulin and stabilizing microtubules, which is essential for the assembly of the primary cilium in cell cultures (Beryozkin2021A). The protein contains a conserved domain, UPF0564, which mediates its association with microtubules and interaction with other UPF0564-containing proteins. This domain enables FAM161A to bind to over 50 other ciliary proteins, including LCA5 and CEP290, indicating its significant role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of ciliary and photoreceptor cells (Beryozkin2021A).

FAM161A also interacts with GOLGA2, a core member of the Golgi apparatus, suggesting a role in Golgi apparatus function. This interaction was identified through prediction algorithms and confirmed experimentally (Kovács2019Networkbased). Additionally, FAM161A interacts with proteins such as TRIM23, VPS52, KIFC3, TRAF2, and REL. These interactions link FAM161A to Golgi apparatus localization, vesicle trafficking, and NF-κB signaling pathways, further connecting it to cilium organization and intracellular transport (Kovács2019Networkbased).
