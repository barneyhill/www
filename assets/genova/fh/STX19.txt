# STX19

## Overview
STX19 is a gene that encodes the protein syntaxin 19, an unconventional Q-SNARE protein involved in vesicular transport processes within human cells. Unlike typical SNARE proteins, syntaxin 19 lacks a C-terminal transmembrane domain, yet it is efficiently targeted to post-Golgi membranes, particularly tubular recycling endosomes, through a cysteine-rich domain that undergoes S-acylation. This post-translational modification is crucial for the protein's membrane localization, stability, and function in endocytic recycling, cell polarity, and exocytosis (Ampah2018Sacylation). Syntaxin 19 interacts with other SNARE proteins, such as VAMP3, VAMP8, SNAP23, SNAP25, and SNAP29, facilitating membrane fusion processes at the plasma membrane (Ampah2018Sacylation). The protein's function and stability are regulated by Golgi-localized S-acyltransferases, highlighting its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Ampah2018Sacylation).

## Structure
Syntaxin 19 (STX19) is an unconventional Q-SNARE protein involved in vesicle fusion processes. It lacks a C-terminal transmembrane domain but is efficiently targeted to post-Golgi membranes through a cysteine-rich domain at its C-terminus, which is essential for its membrane localization (Ampah2018Sacylation). This domain is characterized by a basic patch followed by cysteine residues separated by hydrophobic and proline residues (Ampah2018Sacylation). The primary structure includes a highly conserved cysteine-rich domain (KKRNPCRVLCCWCCPCCSSK) that undergoes S-acylation, a post-translational modification crucial for its targeting and stability (Ampah2018Sacylation).

The secondary structure of STX19 likely includes alpha-helices, as is common in SNARE proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices, forming a coiled-coil domain, which is dispensable for correct localization (Ampah2018Sacylation). The quaternary structure may involve interactions with other SNARE proteins to form a SNARE complex, facilitating its role in vesicle fusion (Ampah2018Sacylation).

S-acylation of STX19 is catalyzed by several Golgi-localized S-acyltransferases, and this modification is critical for its stable membrane association and function (Ampah2018Sacylation).

## Function
STX19 (syntaxin 19) is an unconventional Q-SNARE protein involved in the regulation of vesicular transport processes in human cells. Unlike typical SNARE proteins, STX19 lacks a C-terminal transmembrane domain but is efficiently targeted to post-Golgi membranes, particularly tubular recycling endosomes, where it colocalizes with proteins such as MICAL-L1 and Rab8 (Ampah2018Sacylation). This localization is crucial for its role in endocytic recycling and potentially in cell polarity and exocytosis (Ampah2018Sacylation).

The protein's function is heavily dependent on S-acylation, a reversible post-translational modification that involves the addition of fatty acids to cysteine residues. This modification is essential for the proper targeting of STX19 to the plasma membrane and tubular recycling endosomes, as well as for its stability by preventing proteasomal degradation (Ampah2018Sacylation). S-acylation is catalyzed by Golgi-localized S-acyltransferases, including several zDHHC enzymes, which play a role in its regulation (Ampah2018Sacylation).

STX19 interacts with other SNARE proteins, such as R-SNAREs VAMP3 and VAMP8, and Qbc SNAREs SNAP23, SNAP25, and SNAP29, indicating its involvement in membrane fusion at the plasma membrane (Ampah2018Sacylation). This interaction suggests a broader role in directing proteins to specific cellular compartments and maintaining cellular homeostasis.

## Interactions
STX19, a Q-SNARE protein, interacts with several other SNARE proteins, including R-SNAREs VAMP3 and VAMP8, and Qbc SNAREs SNAP23, SNAP25, and SNAP29. These interactions suggest its involvement in membrane fusion processes at the plasma membrane (Ampah2018Sacylation). STX19 is also associated with Rab8 and MICAL-L1 in tubular recycling endosomes, indicating a role in endocytic recycling and cell polarity (Ampah2018Sacylation). Overexpression of GFP-STX19 affects Rab8 localization, suggesting a potential interaction or involvement in Rab8-related pathways (Ampah2018Sacylation).

S-acylation of STX19 is crucial for its stability and proper localization, as it prevents degradation by the proteasome and facilitates its targeting to tubular recycling endosomes (Ampah2018Sacylation; Warner2022Rerouting). This post-translational modification is catalyzed by Golgi-localized S-acyltransferases, including zDHHCs 3, 7, 11, and 12, which are likely responsible for S-acylating STX19 in HeLaM cells (Ampah2018Sacylation). The presence of degrons in the cysteine-rich domain of STX19 suggests that these regions may be recognized by the ubiquitylation machinery, linking S-acylation status to protein stability (Ampah2018Sacylation).
