# CHST12

## Overview
CHST12 is a gene that encodes the enzyme carbohydrate sulfotransferase 12, which is a member of the sulfotransferase family. This enzyme is primarily involved in the sulfation of glycosaminoglycans, particularly chondroitin sulfate, within the Golgi apparatus. The sulfation process facilitated by carbohydrate sulfotransferase 12 is crucial for the structural integrity and function of the extracellular matrix, especially in cartilage. The enzyme's activity is essential for the proper formation of proteoglycans, which are vital for maintaining cartilage compressibility and resilience. Dysregulation of CHST12 expression has been associated with various diseases, including Kashin-Beck disease and glioblastoma, highlighting its importance in both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions (Guo2019Decreased; Deng2021Effect; Wang2021Knockdown).

## Function
CHST12 (carbohydrate sulfotransferase 12) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the sulfation of glycosaminoglycans, specifically chondroitin sulfate (CS). This sulfation process is essential for maintaining the structural integrity and function of the extracellular matrix in cartilage. CHST12 catalyzes the transfer of sulfate groups to the carbon-4 position of the N-acetylgalactosamine sugar in the disaccharide units of CS, a process crucial for cartilage health and function (Guo2019Decreased).

In healthy human cells, CHST12 is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it contributes to the biosynthesis of sulfated glycosaminoglycans. These sulfated molecules are important for cell signaling and the structural properties of tissues, influencing tissue development and repair. The enzyme's activity ensures the proper formation of proteoglycans, such as aggrecan, which are vital for cartilage compressibility and resilience (Deng2021Effect).

The proper function of CHST12 is crucial for maintaining cartilage integrity, and its dysregulation has been linked to conditions such as Kashin-Beck disease, where decreased expression of CHST12 leads to impaired CS sulfation and cartilage degradation (Guo2019Decreased).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CHST12 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In Kashin-Beck disease (KBD), a condition characterized by cartilage degeneration, the expression of CHST12 is significantly decreased in the articular cartilage of affected pediatric patients. This reduced expression is associated with cartilage damage and chondrocyte necrosis, suggesting that CHST12 plays a role in the disease's pathogenic mechanisms (Lei2019Abnormal).

In glioblastoma (GBM), a type of brain cancer, CHST12 is upregulated, and its high expression correlates with a lower survival rate in patients. The gene's expression influences tumor growth and metastasis through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, making it a potential prognostic factor and therapeutic target in GBM (Wang2021Knockdown).

Additionally, circCHST12, a circular RNA derived from the CHST12 gene, has been identified as a potential biomarker for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Its expression levels are associated with various clinical parameters, and it may serve as a diagnostic tool for ICH (Bai2022Machine). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CHST12 in various pathological conditions.
