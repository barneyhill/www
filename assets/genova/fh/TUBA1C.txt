# TUBA1C

## Overview
TUBA1C is a gene that encodes the tubulin alpha 1c protein, a vital component of the microtubule network within human cells. Tubulin alpha 1c is categorized as a structural protein, playing a crucial role in the polymerization and depolymerization of microtubules, which are essential for maintaining cell structure, intracellular transport, and cell division processes such as mitosis and meiosis (Caracausi2015A). The gene is notably over-expressed in the human hippocampus, underscoring its importance in neural differentiation and the maintenance of the neurotubule network, which is critical for neuron shape and function (Caracausi2015A). Beyond its fundamental cellular roles, alterations in TUBA1C expression have been linked to various cancers, where it influences tumor progression and therapy resistance, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Jiang2023TUBA1C; Li2024TUBA1C).

## Function
TUBA1C encodes the tubulin alpha 1c protein, which is a critical component of microtubules in human cells. Microtubules are essential for maintaining cell structure, facilitating intracellular transport, and enabling cell division processes such as mitosis and meiosis. The protein is involved in the polymerization and depolymerization of microtubules, which are crucial for the formation of the mitotic spindle during cell division (Caracausi2015A).

In the human hippocampus, TUBA1C is significantly over-expressed, indicating its important role in neural differentiation and the maintenance of the neurotubule network. This network is vital for neuron shape and function, contributing to the structural integrity and proper functioning of neurons (Caracausi2015A). The over-expression of TUBA1C, along with other tubulin genes like TUBA1A and TUBA1B, is linked to the extension of neurotubules, which are the main structural features of neurons (Caracausi2015A).

TUBA1C is active in the cytoplasm, particularly during the formation of the mitotic spindle, highlighting its role in cell division and structural maintenance. Its expression and function are crucial for normal cellular processes and the overall health of the organism (Caracausi2015A).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TUBA1C gene have been implicated in various cancers, including bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). In BLCA, TUBA1C is significantly upregulated, correlating with poorer outcomes and increased tumor progression by regulating the cell cycle and apoptosis (Jiang2023TUBA1C). In PDAC, high TUBA1C expression is associated with poor prognosis, promoting oncogenesis through cell cycle regulation (Albahde2020Upregulated). Similarly, in LUAD, TUBA1C overexpression is linked to poor prognosis and increased immune cell infiltration, affecting the tumor microenvironment (Bian2021Prognostic).

In ccRCC, TUBA1C is associated with resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, contributing to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and poor prognosis. Its expression is linked to the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway and increased infiltration of regulatory T cells, which are associated with higher tumor mutation burden and genetic variation (Li2024TUBA1C). These findings suggest that TUBA1C plays a significant role in cancer progression and therapy resistance.
