# SNTA1

## Overview
The SNTA1 gene encodes the protein syntrophin alpha 1, a membrane-associated adaptor protein that plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling and structural organization. Syntrophin alpha 1 is a component of the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC), which links the extracellular matrix to the intracellular cytoskeleton, particularly in muscle cells (Bhat2012Syntrophin; Ahn1996The). This protein is characterized by its unique domain structure, including pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, a PDZ domain, and a syntrophin unique (SU) domain, which facilitate its interactions with various proteins and lipids (Bhat2012Syntrophin; Ali2022Actin). Syntrophin alpha 1 is involved in the regulation of ion channels and signal transduction pathways, influencing processes such as muscle contraction and neuromuscular junction formation (Bhat2012Syntrophin; Dong2022SNTA1deficient). Mutations in SNTA1 have been linked to cardiac conditions, including Long QT Syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining cardiac health (Ueda2008Syntrophin).

## Structure
The SNTA1 gene encodes the alpha-1-syntrophin protein, which is a 58-59 kDa membrane-associated adaptor protein composed of 505 amino acids in its unprocessed form (Bhat2012Syntrophin; Bhat2020Flavonoid). The protein is characterized by a unique domain organization that includes two pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, a PDZ domain, and a syntrophin unique (SU) domain (Bhat2012Syntrophin; Ali2022Actin). The PH domains are split by the insertion of the PDZ domain, forming a PH N -PDZ-PH C tandem structure, which is involved in binding to membrane lipids and facilitating protein-protein interactions (Bhat2012Syntrophin).

SNTA1 is part of the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC), linking the extracellular matrix to intracellular targets and the cell cytoskeleton (Bhat2012Syntrophin). It interacts with various proteins, including neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and Growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2), through its PDZ and proline-rich regions, respectively (Bhat2012Syntrophin; Ali2022Actin). SNTA1 undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its interactions and signaling roles (Bhat2012Syntrophin). The protein may exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, particularly in exon 6 (Adams1995Mouse).

## Function
The SNTA1 gene encodes α-1-syntrophin, a protein that plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function in healthy human cells. It is a key component of the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC), linking the extracellular matrix to the intracellular cytoskeleton, particularly in muscle cells (Bhat2012Syntrophin; Ahn1996The). This protein is involved in signal transduction pathways, acting as a scaffold for various signaling complexes. It facilitates the precise localization and regulation of cellular proteins, contributing to the formation of signaling complexes that stabilize protein associations at the cell membrane (Bhat2012Syntrophin).

α-1-syntrophin is crucial for the proper localization and functioning of ion channels, such as the cardiac sodium channel Nav1.5 and aquaporin-4, affecting their subcellular distribution and stability (Bhat2012Syntrophin; Dong2022SNTA1deficient). It also interacts with calmodulin, influencing calcium signaling, which is essential for muscle contraction and other cellular processes (Dong2022SNTA1deficient). In muscle cells, α-1-syntrophin is involved in neuromuscular junction formation and modulates myogenin expression, which is vital for myogenesis and muscle development (Bhat2012Syntrophin). These functions underscore its role in maintaining cellular stability and signaling in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SNTA1 gene, which encodes the protein α1-syntrophin, have been implicated in several cardiac conditions. One notable mutation, A390V, is associated with Long QT Syndrome (LQTS), a disorder that affects cardiac electrical activity and can lead to arrhythmias. This mutation disrupts the association of SNTA1 with the plasma membrane Ca-ATPase subtype 4b (PMCA4b) and increases nitrosylation of the cardiac sodium channel SCN5A, leading to an increased late sodium current. This biophysical dysfunction is characteristic of sodium-channel-mediated LQTS (LQT3) (Ueda2008Syntrophin).

SNTA1 deficiency in cardiomyocytes has been linked to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and calcium handling disorders. SNTA1-deficient cardiomyocytes exhibit a hypertrophic phenotype, with significant differences in gene expression compared to wild-type cells. These cells show altered expression of genes related to the fetal gene program, cardiac myofibril, and calcium handling, which are associated with cardiac hypertrophy. The hypertrophic cardiomyopathy pathway is notably enriched in these cells, suggesting a potential link between SNTA1 deficiency and cardiac hypertrophy (Dong2022SNTA1deficient).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of SNTA1 mutations and deficiencies in contributing to cardiac diseases, emphasizing the importance of maintaining proper SNTA1 function for cardiac health.

## Interactions
SNTA1 (syntrophin alpha 1) is involved in various protein interactions, playing a crucial role in cellular signaling and structural organization. It is a component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex, linking the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. SNTA1 interacts with neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and plasma membrane calcium ATPase (PMCA) subtype 4b, forming a macromolecular complex that modulates cardiac sodium channels, particularly SCN5A. This interaction is significant in the context of Long QT Syndrome (LQTS), where mutations like A390V in SNTA1 disrupt the association with PMCA4b, leading to increased nitrosylation of SCN5A and altered sodium currents (Choi2016α1Syntrophin; Ueda2008Syntrophin).

SNTA1 also interacts with G-proteins, affecting G-protein signaling pathways, and binds calmodulin, suggesting a role in calcium signaling (Bhat2012Syntrophin). In breast cancer cells, SNTA1 forms a trimeric complex with p66Shc and RhoA, which is crucial for RhoA activation and actin cytoskeleton modulation, influencing cell proliferation and migration (Ali2022Actin). These interactions highlight SNTA1's role in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and structural organization.
