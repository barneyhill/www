# NAT10

## Overview
NAT10 is a gene that encodes the N-acetyltransferase 10 protein, which is a multifunctional enzyme involved in various cellular processes. The protein is categorized as an acetyltransferase, specifically an ATP-dependent RNA acetyltransferase, and plays a critical role in ribosome biogenesis and RNA modification. It is responsible for the acetylation of cytidine residues in ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and transfer RNA (tRNA), which are essential for proper ribosome function and protein synthesis (Ito2014Human; Sharma2015Yeast). Additionally, NAT10 exhibits lysine acetyltransferase activity, influencing chromatin structure and gene expression (Ito2014Human). The protein's involvement extends to cellular processes such as DNA damage response, nucleolar architecture, and cell division, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cell growth and division (Sleiman2019Recent). Alterations in NAT10 expression have been linked to various cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Tao2021NAT10; Li2017NAT10).

## Structure
The NAT10 protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. It features an acetyl-CoA-dependent acetyltransferase domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity, and an ATP-dependent helicase domain, which contributes to its function in RNA modification (Zhou2024Molecular). The protein also contains an RNA binding domain, which is exclusively helical and plays a significant role in its interaction with RNA substrates (Zhou2024Molecular).

Structurally, NAT10 forms a symmetrical heart-shaped dimer, with its functional domains strategically positioned around the acetyltransferase active sites. This dimeric form is stabilized by interactions between the helicase and RNA binding domains, which are essential for its biological activity (Zhou2024Molecular). The GNAT domain of NAT10 is noted for its wider substrate binding tunnel, allowing it to accommodate larger RNA substrates (Zhou2024Molecular).

Key residues such as His548 and Tyr549 within the GNAT domain are critical for its catalytic activity, as they are involved in stabilizing the binding of substrates through van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonds (Zhou2024Molecular). The presence of electropositive patches on the protein surface is implicated in RNA binding, highlighting the importance of these structural features for its function (Zhou2024Molecular).

## Function
NAT10 is an ATP-dependent RNA acetyltransferase that plays a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis in human cells. It is responsible for the formation of N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C) in 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), a modification essential for the processing of pre-rRNA into mature rRNA, specifically in the transition from 30S pre-rRNA to 21S pre-rRNA (Ito2014Human). This acetylation is critical for the synthesis of the 40S ribosomal subunit, and depletion of NAT10 leads to a reduced 40S/60S ribosomal subunit ratio (Ito2014Human). NAT10 is localized in the nucleolus, consistent with its role in early pre-rRNA processing (Sharma2015Yeast).

Beyond its role in rRNA processing, NAT10 is involved in the acetylation of tRNAs, which is important for proper ribosome function and protein synthesis (Sharma2015Yeast). It also has lysine acetyltransferase activity toward histones, influencing chromatin structure and gene expression (Ito2014Human). NAT10 is implicated in nucleolar architecture, cytokinesis, and mitosis, and is essential for maintaining normal cell growth and division (Ito2014Human; Sharma2015Yeast). Its activity is linked to various cellular processes, including the DNA damage response and telomerase function (Sleiman2019Recent).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NAT10 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), NAT10 is upregulated and enhances the stability of mutant p53, promoting cell proliferation and correlating with poor overall survival (Li2017NAT10). In gastric cancer, NAT10 is associated with metastasis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), influencing the expression of COL5A1, a marker of EMT (Zhang2021NAT10). NAT10 also plays a role in colorectal cancer progression by stabilizing KIF23 mRNA, which activates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, leading to increased cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (Jin2022Acetyltransferase).

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), high NAT10 expression is linked to lower overall survival and is considered an independent prognostic factor (Tao2021NAT10). NAT10's role extends beyond cancer, as its inhibition has shown potential therapeutic benefits in Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS), a premature aging disease, by improving healthspan in a mouse model (Balmus2018Targeting). These findings suggest that NAT10 is a significant factor in cancer progression and other diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
N-acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. NAT10 interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, acetylating it at lysine 120, which is essential for p53 activation and stability. This interaction is significant in the context of DNA damage, where NAT10 translocates to the nucleoplasm to protect p53 from degradation by Mdm2, a ubiquitin ligase that NAT10 also interacts with and ubiquitinates, promoting its degradation (Liu2016NAT).

NAT10 also interacts with RNPS1, a protein that stabilizes NAT10 by inhibiting its ubiquitination through the E3 ubiquitin ligase ZSWIM6. This interaction is significant in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, where RNPS1 enhances NAT10's role in tRNA ac4C modifications, impacting cancer progression (Wang2024RNPS1).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, NAT10 interacts with mutant p53, enhancing its stability and activity by counteracting Mdm2, which is associated with poor prognosis in patients (Li2017NAT10). These interactions highlight NAT10's role in regulating protein stability and function, particularly in stress responses and cancer progression.
