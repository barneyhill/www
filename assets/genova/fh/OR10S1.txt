# OR10S1

## Overview
OR10S1 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 10 subfamily S member 1, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This receptor is primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a critical role in the olfactory system by binding specific odorants and initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell (Morgan2013Proline:). While OR10S1 is predominantly expressed in the olfactory epithelium, it is also ectopically expressed in other tissues, such as the colon, where its functions remain to be fully elucidated (Yasi2019Rapid). The receptor has been deorphanized, with lilial and nonanal identified as ligands, highlighting its ability to bind multiple chemicals and suggesting potential roles beyond olfaction, including possible involvement in host-microbiome interactions (Yasi2019Rapid).

## Function
OR10S1 is an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, primarily involved in detecting odor molecules. This receptor is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell (Morgan2013Proline:). The receptor's activation involves the binding of odorant molecules, which triggers a neuronal response, contributing to the sense of smell (Morgan2013Proline:).

In addition to its role in olfaction, OR10S1 is ectopically expressed in various tissues, including the colon, where its specific functions are not yet fully understood (Yasi2019Rapid). The deorphanization of OR10S1, which involves identifying ligands that activate this receptor, has been achieved using a yeast-based system. This process identified lilial and nonanal as ligands that activate OR10S1, suggesting that the receptor can bind multiple chemicals, consistent with the general function of olfactory receptors in detecting a wide range of odorants (Yasi2019Rapid). The identification of these ligands is crucial for studying the role of OR10S1 in non-olfactory tissues, particularly in the context of host-microbiome communication in the colon (Yasi2019Rapid).
