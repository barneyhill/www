# NGFR

## Overview
The NGFR gene encodes the nerve growth factor receptor, also known as p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), which is a transmembrane protein belonging to the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. This receptor plays a crucial role in the regulation of neuronal growth, survival, and apoptosis. Structurally, the NGFR protein is characterized by an extracellular domain with four cysteine-rich repeats, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain, which are essential for its function in neurotrophin signaling (Johnson1986Expression). Functionally, NGFR is involved in various cellular processes, including cell survival, proliferation, and apoptosis, through its interactions with neurotrophic factors and other receptors (Liu2021Role). The receptor's activity is modulated by its ability to form complexes with other proteins, such as Sortilin and Trk receptor tyrosine kinases, which influence its signaling pathways (Nykjaer2005p75NTR). Clinically, alterations in NGFR expression and function have been linked to psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its significance in human health and disease (Zhao2022NGFR; Bruno2023The).

## Structure
The nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR), also known as p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), is a transmembrane protein with a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of NGFR includes a sequence of 427 amino acids, featuring a 28 amino acid signal peptide, an extracellular domain with four cysteine-rich repeats, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain (Johnson1986Expression). The extracellular domain is characterized by a high number of cysteine residues, forming disulfide bonds that contribute to its stability (Johnson1986Expression; Vilar2017Structural).

The tertiary structure of NGFR involves the folding of these domains, with the extracellular domain forming a highly ordered structure that is crucial for ligand binding (Johnson1986Expression). The receptor can form disulfide-linked dimers, which may allow a single nerve growth factor (NGF) dimer to bind simultaneously to two receptor molecules, potentially explaining the high and low affinity forms of the receptor (Johnson1986Expression).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation are significant, affecting the receptor's molecular weight and potentially its ligand recognition (Johnson1986Expression; Vilar2017Structural). The receptor's structure and modifications are essential for its role in neurotrophin signaling.

## Function
The nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR), also known as p75NTR, is a 75-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a significant role in the regulation of neuronal growth, survival, and apoptosis. It is part of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily and is encoded by a gene located on chromosome 17q21.33 (Liu2021Role). NGFR consists of three domains: an extracellular receptor domain, a unique transmembrane helix, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. The extracellular domain contains four cysteine-rich regions responsible for binding neurotrophic factors and proneurotrophins (Liu2021Role).

NGFR is involved in various molecular processes, including the regulation of cell survival, proliferation, attachment, migration, differentiation, and apoptosis. It achieves these functions through pathways such as nuclear transcription factor-kappa B, Jun N-terminal kinase, and ceramide signaling (Liu2021Role). Although NGFR is a low-affinity receptor, it can participate in high-affinity binding by interacting with the NTRK1 receptor to promote neurite growth and survival (Liu2021Role). NGFR activation by proNGF can induce apoptotic signaling pathways involving the co-receptor sortilin (Liu2021Role). The receptor is active in various tissues, including epithelial, mesenchymal, lymphoid hematopoietic, and tumor tissues (Liu2021Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the NGFR gene, which encodes the p75 neurotrophin receptor, have been implicated in several psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. In the context of psychiatric conditions, specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the NGFR gene, such as rs2072446 and rs11466162, have been associated with schizophrenia in the Chinese Han population. The T allele of rs2072446 may alter the NGFR protein's function, potentially contributing to schizophrenia, while the rs11466162 SNP might affect psychiatric disorders by influencing protein expression (Zhao2022NGFR).

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), NGFR/p75NTR is involved in neuronal survival and apoptosis. The rs2072446 variant has been linked to an increased risk of sporadic AD in the Chinese Han population, and its T allele is associated with a heavier amyloid-beta burden, particularly in non-carriers of the APOE ε4 allele (Bruno2023The). NGFR/p75NTR's interaction with amyloid-beta peptides is implicated in AD pathogenesis, contributing to neurotoxicity and tau hyperphosphorylation (Bruno2023The). The receptor's role in AD is multifactorial, involving interactions with various proteins and signaling pathways (Bruno2023The).

## Interactions
The nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR), also known as p75NTR, participates in various interactions with proteins that influence its signaling pathways. NGFR forms a complex with Sortilin, acting as a coreceptor for proNGF, which is crucial for proapoptotic signaling. This interaction determines whether cells undergo apoptosis or survival in response to proNGF (Nykjaer2005p75NTR). NGFR also interacts with Trk receptor tyrosine kinases, enhancing their affinity and specificity for neurotrophins like NGF, BDNF, NT3, and NT4, which is essential for neuronal survival and differentiation (Nykjaer2005p75NTR).

In the context of cancer, NGFR interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53. It inactivates p53 by enhancing its MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and proteolysis, thereby reducing p53 levels. NGFR binds to the C-terminal region of MDM2 and can also directly bind to the central DNA-binding domain of p53, inhibiting its transcriptional activity (Zhou2016Nerve). These interactions suggest that NGFR plays a role in promoting cancer cell proliferation and survival by inhibiting p53 activation (Zhou2016Nerve).
