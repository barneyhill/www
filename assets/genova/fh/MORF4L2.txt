# MORF4L2

## Overview
MORF4L2 (mortality factor 4 like 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. The protein, also referred to as MRGX, is a component of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex, which plays a crucial role in the acetylation of histone H2A and H4 tails, thereby facilitating transcriptional activation of genes involved in various cellular processes (Kooblall2022miR31565p). MORF4L2 is active in the nucleus and is implicated in DNA repair, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis, contributing to normal cellular function and organismal development (Kooblall2022miR31565p). The protein is characterized by a conserved C-terminal MRG domain, essential for protein-protein interactions, although it lacks the chromodomain found in its paralog MRG15 (Devoucoux2021MRG). MORF4L2 is also involved in the regulation of telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) and interacts with microRNA miR-3156-5p, suggesting its regulatory role in telomere biology and gene expression (Scheibe2013Quantitative; Kooblall2022miR31565p).

## Function
MORF4L2 (mortality factor 4 like 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. It is a component of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex, which catalyzes the acetylation of histone H2A and H4 tails. This modification alters the interaction between DNA, histones, and other proteins, facilitating the transcriptional activation of genes involved in various cellular processes (Kooblall2022miR31565p). The MORF4L2 protein is active in the nucleus and plays a role in DNA repair, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis, contributing to normal cellular function and organismal development (Kooblall2022miR31565p).

In the context of chromatin-based processes, MORF4L2, also known as MRGX, is involved in cell proliferation and senescence. It shares a conserved C-terminal MRG domain, which is important for protein-protein interactions, although it lacks the chromodomain present in its paralog MRG15 (Devoucoux2021MRG). While the specific function of MORF4L2 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, it is suggested to have roles in chromatin-based processes and cell proliferation (Devoucoux2021MRG).

## Clinical Significance
MORF4L2 (mortality factor 4 like 2) is implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In the context of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), MORF4L2 is part of the NETest, a blood biomarker test used for diagnosing and managing multiple NET subtypes, including gastroenteropancreatic and bronchopulmonary NETs. The NETest, which includes MORF4L2 among 51 transcripts, is noted for its high sensitivity and specificity, surpassing traditional biomarkers like chromogranin A in monitoring NET disease status and progression (Kooblall2022miR31565p).

Alterations in MORF4L2 expression are regulated by miR-3156-5p, which is significantly downregulated in the serum of patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1 (MEN1). This downregulation affects MORF4L2 expression, potentially impacting the diagnosis and management of MEN1-associated tumors. Despite these changes, no significant effects on cell viability, apoptosis, or migration were observed in vitro, suggesting that key oncogenic changes may have already occurred in these cell lines (Kooblall2022miR31565p).

The clinical significance of MORF4L2 expression alterations in MEN1 and other cancers remains to be fully elucidated, but the gene's role in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation suggests it could influence tumor development and progression (Kooblall2022miR31565p).

## Interactions
MORF4L2 is a component of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex, which plays a role in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation. This complex is involved in acetylating histone H2A and H4 tails, which affects DNA interaction and transcriptional activation of genes related to oncogene-mediated growth, tumor suppressor-mediated growth arrest, and DNA repair (Kooblall2022miR31565p). MORF4L2 has been identified as a novel regulator of telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA), interacting with TERRA to maintain its levels and association with telomeres. Knockdown of MORF4L2 results in reduced TERRA levels, indicating its role in TERRA homeostasis and telomere biology (Scheibe2013Quantitative).

MORF4L2 is also involved in the regulation of gene expression through its interaction with miR-3156-5p. This microRNA regulates MORF4L2 expression, with miR-3156-5p mimics reducing MORF4L2 protein levels and inhibitors increasing it. This interaction suggests a regulatory mechanism that could be significant in the context of neuroendocrine tumors (Kooblall2022miR31565p). Additionally, MORF4L2 is implicated in the stability of TERRA molecules associated with telomeres, which is crucial for telomere protection and genomic stability (Zhang2020Identification).
