# HMGB3

## Overview
HMGB3, or high mobility group box 3, is a gene that encodes a non-histone chromosomal protein belonging to the high mobility group (HMG) protein family. The protein encoded by HMGB3 is characterized by its HMG-box domains, which facilitate DNA binding and play a critical role in chromatin architecture and gene regulation. As a chromatin-binding protein, high mobility group box 3 is involved in essential cellular processes such as DNA replication, transcription, recombination, and repair. It is predominantly expressed in embryonic and hematopoietic stem cells, where it regulates the balance between self-renewal and differentiation. The protein's ability to bind and bend DNA is crucial for its function in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation. HMGB3 has been implicated in various cancers, where its altered expression is associated with tumor progression and chemoresistance, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Nemeth2006Hmgb3; Wen2021The; Ma2022HMGB3).

## Structure
HMGB3 is a member of the high mobility group (HMG) protein family, characterized by the presence of HMG-box domains that facilitate DNA binding. The primary structure of HMGB3 includes amino acid sequences forming these domains, which are crucial for its function. The secondary structure typically consists of alpha helices arranged in an L-shaped configuration, allowing the protein to fit into the minor groove of DNA, causing it to bend towards the major groove (Wen2021The; Xu2013Localization).

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices, enabling interaction with DNA and other proteins. HMGB3 proteins often function as monomers and lack a quaternary structure. The protein contains two stable binding peptide motifs known as the 'A-box' and 'B-box,' each consisting of about 80 amino acids, which are essential for DNA binding (Wen2021The).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can influence the DNA-binding activity of HMGB3. For instance, the neutral C-terminal domain of HMGB3 in Tetrahymena thermophila is phosphorylated at several serine residues, which may play a role in chromatin dynamics (Xu2013Localization). Splice variants of HMGB3 exist, which can alter the protein's functional properties (Li2012Multiple).

## Function
HMGB3 (high mobility group box 3) is a non-histone chromosomal protein that plays a crucial role in DNA architecture and regulation. It is involved in DNA replication, transcription, recombination, and repair, acting as a chromatin-binding protein that influences gene expression by facilitating chromatin remodeling (Nemeth2006Hmgb3; Wen2021The). HMGB3 is primarily expressed in embryonic and bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells, where it regulates the balance between self-renewal and differentiation of these cells (Nemeth2006Hmgb3; Wen2021The).

In healthy human cells, HMGB3 contributes to the flexibility of DNA, which is essential for activating gene promoters and maintaining the proper function of hematopoietic stem cells (Zheng2018Abnormal). It is localized in the nucleus, chromosomes, and cytoplasm, where it binds and bends DNA, a function critical for its role in chromatin structure interaction and transcription regulation (Wen2021The). The protein's activity is modulated by its two DNA-binding domains, A-box and B-box, which allow it to recognize and bend DNA, with the C-terminal end acting as a damper to reduce binding force (Wen2021The).

## Clinical Significance
HMGB3 is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In gastric cancer, overexpression of HMGB3 is linked to poor prognosis and increased tumor aggressiveness. Silencing HMGB3 in gastric cancer cells inhibits proliferation, induces cell cycle arrest, and increases apoptosis, suggesting its role in tumor progression. This is associated with changes in the expression of proteins like p53, p21, and the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, as well as reduced expression of MMP2 and MMP9, which are involved in metastasis (Guo2016Knockdown).

In ovarian cancer, particularly high-grade serous ovarian cancer, HMGB3 is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis and chemoresistance, especially to platinum-based chemotherapy. HMGB3 interacts with PARP1, contributing to resistance against PARP inhibitors like olaparib by facilitating PARylation activity crucial for DNA repair (Ma2022HMGB3).

In colorectal cancer, HMGB3 is upregulated and promotes cell proliferation and migration. It activates the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway, contributing to tumor growth and metastasis. High HMGB3 expression correlates with advanced tumor stages and poor survival outcomes (Zhang2017HMGB3; Gong2022HMGB3).

Overall, HMGB3's role in cancer involves promoting tumor proliferation, migration, and resistance to chemotherapy, making it a potential therapeutic target.

## Interactions
HMGB3 interacts with PARP1, a protein involved in DNA repair, to promote resistance to PARP inhibitors in ovarian cancer. This interaction was confirmed through GST pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments, demonstrating that HMGB3 and PARP1 can be co-precipitated, indicating a direct interaction (Ma2022HMGB3). The interaction is influenced by PARP1's poly(ADP-ribosylation) (PARylation) activity, which is crucial for DNA repair. Olaparib treatment reduces the interaction between HMGB3 and PARP1, while DNA damage induced by MMS enhances it (Ma2022HMGB3). HMGB3 facilitates the PARylation activity of PARP1, as shown by experiments where HMGB3 knockdown reduces PARylation levels, while overexpression increases them (Ma2022HMGB3). HMGB3 also inhibits PARP trapping and DNA damage induced by olaparib by preventing PARP1 from binding to chromatin at DNA damage sites (Ma2022HMGB3).

HMGB3 is also involved in RNA interactions. It binds to HIV-1 Tat mRNA, and its knockdown results in increased splicing at a site directly bound by HMGB3, suggesting a role in RNA splicing (Hamilton2023The).
