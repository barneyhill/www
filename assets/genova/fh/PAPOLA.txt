# PAPOLA

## Overview
PAPOLA, or poly(A) polymerase alpha, is a gene that encodes a critical enzyme involved in the post-transcriptional modification of pre-mRNA in eukaryotic cells. The enzyme, also named poly(A) polymerase alpha, is responsible for catalyzing the addition of a polyadenine (poly(A)) tail to the 3' end of mRNA molecules, a modification essential for mRNA stability, export from the nucleus, and translation efficiency. As a nucleotidyltransferase, PAPOLA interacts with various components of the mRNA processing machinery, including the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex, to ensure precise and efficient polyadenylation. The enzyme's activity is modulated by several post-translational modifications and protein-protein interactions, which are crucial for its regulation and function in different cellular contexts (Vethantham2008Sumoylation; Tudek2018The; Chan2010Pre‐mRNA).

## Structure
Poly(A) polymerase alpha (PAPOLA) is a key enzyme involved in the polyadenylation of mRNA precursors. The primary structure of PAPOLA includes a nucleotidyltransferase catalytic domain located in the N-terminal half, which is highly conserved and essential for its enzymatic activity (Chan2010Pre‐mRNA). The enzyme also features an RNA-binding domain, although this binding is not sequence-specific and requires interactions with other 3' processing factors for recruitment (Chan2010Pre‐mRNA). The C-terminal domain (CTD) of PAPOLA is rich in serine and threonine residues and contains a bipartite nuclear localization signal, which is crucial for its nuclear localization (Chan2010Pre‐mRNA).

PAPOLA undergoes various post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, acetylation, and sumoylation, which regulate its activity, localization, and stability (Vethantham2008Sumoylation; Rapti2010The). Sumoylation, in particular, affects PAPOLA's nuclear localization and enzymatic activity by modifying lysine residues in the C-terminal regulatory domain (Vethantham2008Sumoylation). These modifications are tissue- and cell-type-dependent, indicating a complex regulatory mechanism (Vethantham2008Sumoylation). PAPOLA also has splice variant isoforms, which may result in different functional properties (Rapti2010The).

## Function
PAPOLA (poly(A) polymerase alpha) is a crucial enzyme in the polyadenylation of pre-mRNA, a process essential for mRNA maturation, stability, export, and translation efficiency in human cells. PAPOLA catalyzes the addition of a poly(A) tail to the 3' end of mRNA, a step that is enhanced by its interaction with the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex. The presence of the AAUAAA sequence element is necessary for CPSF recruitment, which in turn enhances PAPOLA's activity (Tudek2018The; Kühn2009Poly(A) page 3 of 8).

PAPOLA's activity is further stimulated by the nuclear poly(A) binding protein PABPN1, which decreases the enzyme's off-rate from the target RNA, allowing the synthesis of a poly(A) tail of approximately 250 nucleotides without dissociation (Tudek2018The; Kühn2009Poly(A) page 6 of 8). This processivity changes from highly processive to distributive after the initial 250 nucleotides, potentially due to structural interference by PABPN1 or impaired interaction between CPSF and PAPOLA (Tudek2018The).

PAPOLA is also involved in RNA decay pathways, where it participates in the hyperadenylation of decay substrates, marking them for degradation by the exosome. This function is part of a quality control mechanism ensuring the proper regulation of RNA stability and decay (Bresson2013The).

## Interactions
Poly(A) polymerase alpha (PAPOLA) is a key enzyme involved in the polyadenylation of mRNA precursors, interacting with several proteins and RNA elements to regulate mRNA processing. PAPOLA is a component of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex, which is crucial for the polyadenylation of mRNA precursors. Within this complex, PAPOLA interacts with the human Fip1 (hFip1) protein, which binds to the acidic N-terminus of PAPOLA. This interaction is significant for the formation of a ternary complex with CPSF160, facilitating the recruitment of PAPOLA to RNA and enhancing its activity (Zamecnikova2017FIP1L1; Kaufmann2004Human).

hFip1 also stimulates PAPOLA's polyadenylation activity by binding to U-rich RNA elements, a process that does not require the AAUAAA signal. The C-terminal domain of hFip1, rich in charged amino acids, is necessary for this stimulation, indicating a specific regulatory role in PAPOLA's function (Kaufmann2004Human). These interactions highlight PAPOLA's role in the assembly and function of the 3' end processing machinery, emphasizing its importance in mRNA stability and translation (Kaufmann2004Human).
