# UPK1A

## Overview
Uroplakin 1A (UPK1A) is a gene that encodes the protein uroplakin 1A, a member of the tetraspanin family characterized by four transmembrane domains. This protein is a crucial component of the asymmetric unit membrane (AUM) in the urothelium, the epithelial lining of the bladder, where it plays a significant role in maintaining structural integrity and barrier function. Uroplakin 1A is involved in forming crystalline patches on the AUM, contributing to the mechanical stability of the urothelial surface. It interacts with other uroplakin proteins, such as Uroplakin II, to form heterodimers essential for the structural organization of the AUM. Beyond its structural role, UPK1A is implicated in cell-cell interactions, signal transduction, and serves as a receptor for uropathogenic Escherichia coli, which is responsible for the majority of urinary tract infections (Yu1994Uroplakins; Kong2010Characterization; Wu1995Selective).

## Structure
Uroplakin 1A (UPK1A) is a protein encoded by the UPK1A gene and is a member of the tetraspanin family, characterized by four transmembrane domains (Kong2010Characterization). The protein consists of 256 amino acids and is involved in forming the asymmetric unit membrane structure of urothelial plaques (Kong2010Characterization). UPK1A is part of the uroplakin family, which includes other transmembrane proteins such as uroplakin 1B, uroplakin II, and uroplakin III, and these proteins are highly conserved across various organisms (Kong2010Characterization).

The primary structure of UPK1A includes eight exons, which encode the protein's sequence (Kong2010Characterization). As a tetraspanin, UPK1A likely forms a compact tertiary structure with its transmembrane domains contributing to its stability and function within the membrane. The quaternary structure of UPK1A involves its ability to form heterodimers with other uroplakins, which is crucial for its role in the urothelial plaques (Kong2010Characterization). Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation may occur, which can influence the protein's function and interactions. However, specific details on secondary structures, such as prominent folds, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
Uroplakin 1A (UPK1A) is a critical component of the asymmetric unit membrane (AUM) in the urothelium, the epithelial lining of the bladder. It plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity and barrier function of the bladder epithelium, which is essential for preventing cell rupture during bladder distention (Yu1994Uroplakins; Wu1995Selective). UPK1A is a member of the tetraspanin family, characterized by four transmembrane domains, and is involved in forming crystalline patches on the AUM, contributing to the mechanical stability of the urothelial surface (Yu1994Uroplakins; DeSalle2014Generation).

UPK1A interacts specifically with Uroplakin II (UPII) to form a heterodimer, which is crucial for the structural organization of the AUM (Wu1995Selective). This interaction is significant for the formation of stable complexes that contribute to the barrier properties of the urothelium (Wu1995Selective). UPK1A also plays a role in cell-cell interactions and signal transduction, impacting bladder permeability and protection against urine toxicity (DeSalle2014Generation). Additionally, UPK1A serves as a receptor for uropathogenic Escherichia coli, which is responsible for the majority of urinary tract infections (DeSalle2014Generation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the UPK1A gene have been implicated in various cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), UPK1A is highly expressed in tumor tissues compared to non-tumor tissues, and this overexpression is associated with poor overall survival. UPK1A is a direct transcriptional target of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), and its upregulation under hypoxic conditions promotes glycolysis and proliferation in HCC cells (Song2020Reciprocal).

In contrast, UPK1A acts as a tumor suppressor in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Its expression is frequently downregulated in ESCC, often due to promoter hypermethylation. This downregulation is associated with advanced clinical stages, lymph node metastasis, and poor prognosis. UPK1A downregulation leads to increased cell proliferation and metastasis, partly by affecting the nuclear translocation of β-catenin and its downstream targets (Kong2010Characterization).

The long noncoding RNA UPK1A-AS1, related to UPK1A, is also implicated in cancer. In HCC, UPK1A-AS1 is overexpressed and promotes cell proliferation by interacting with EZH2 and sponging miR-138-5p, contributing to poor prognosis (Zhang2020Long). In pancreatic cancer, UPK1A-AS1 is involved in chemoresistance by enhancing DNA repair mechanisms (Zhang2022Cancer-associated).

## Interactions
Uroplakin 1A (UPK1A) is known for its interactions with other uroplakin proteins, forming essential complexes in the urothelium. UPK1A physically interacts with UPK2, forming a heterodimer that is crucial for the structural integrity of the asymmetrical unit membrane (AUM) in urothelial cells (Wu1995Selective; Kaczmarek2023Loss). This interaction is part of a larger complex that includes UPK1B and UPK3, which together form heterotetramers that assemble into hexameric rings, contributing to the stability and mechanical strength of the bladder epithelium (Kaczmarek2023Loss).

UPK1A also forms homodimers and oligomers, which are important for its function in the AUM. These interactions have been studied using cross-linking experiments, which have identified UPK1A homodimers and UPK1A/UPK2 heterodimers as significant components of the AUM (Wu1995Selective). The specificity and stability of these interactions are crucial for the formation of the crystalline arrays that characterize the AUM, highlighting the role of UPK1A in maintaining the urothelial barrier (Wu1995Selective). These interactions underscore the importance of UPK1A in the structural and functional integrity of the urothelium.
