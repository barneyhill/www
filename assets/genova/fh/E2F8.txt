# E2F8

## Overview
E2F8 is a gene that encodes the E2F transcription factor 8, a member of the E2F family of transcription factors, which are pivotal in regulating cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and differentiation. Unlike typical E2F proteins, E2F8 is characterized by its unique structural features, including two distinct DNA-binding domains that classify it within the winged-helix family, and it functions independently of DP co-factors (Christensen2005Characterization; Morgunova2015Structural). As a transcriptional repressor, E2F8 plays a crucial role in controlling the expression of E2F-target genes, particularly during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, and is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating the E2F1-p53 apoptotic axis (Li2008Synergistic). E2F8's involvement in tumor suppression, especially in the liver, highlights its significance in preventing hepatocellular carcinoma and other cancers, making it a potential therapeutic target (Park2015E2F8; Kent2016E2f8).

## Structure
E2F8 is an atypical member of the E2F family of transcription factors, characterized by its unique structural features. The protein contains two distinct DNA-binding domains (DBDs), which are structurally similar to those found in typical E2F and DP proteins. These DBDs are composed of three alpha-helices and a small antiparallel beta-sheet, classifying them within the winged-helix family (Christensen2005Characterization; Morgunova2015Structural). The two DBDs are connected by an 82-amino-acid linker, with 23 residues forming two alpha-helices that wrap around the DBDs, contributing to a larger interface area between the subdomains compared to other E2F proteins (Morgunova2015Structural).

E2F8 lacks several conserved domains present in other E2F family members, such as the DP-dimerization, retinoblastoma-binding, and transcriptional activation domains (Deng2010E2F8). It does not require DP co-factors for DNA binding, which is a distinctive feature of its structure (Christensen2005Characterization). The protein is prone to degradation, potentially due to 'KEN' motifs that target it for degradation by the APC/C complex (Christensen2005Characterization). E2F8 is expressed primarily during the S-phase of the cell cycle and localizes to the nuclear compartment of cells (Christensen2005Characterization).

## Function
E2F8 is a transcriptional repressor and a member of the E2F family of transcription factors, which are crucial for regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. In healthy human cells, E2F8 plays a significant role in controlling the expression of E2F-target genes, particularly during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. It achieves this by directly repressing the transcription of E2F1, a critical E2F target gene, thereby maintaining normal levels of E2F1 protein and mRNA (Li2008Synergistic).

E2F8, along with E2F7, forms a unique repressive arm of the E2F transcriptional network, crucial for controlling the E2F1-p53 apoptotic axis and maintaining cellular homeostasis. The combined loss of E2F7 and E2F8 leads to increased E2F1 and p53 protein levels, resulting in widespread apoptosis, indicating their essential role in embryonic development and cell survival (Li2008Synergistic).

E2F8 is also involved in tumor suppression, particularly in the liver, where it helps regulate the transcriptional output of E2F target genes essential for DNA repair and cell cycle control. Its activity is critical during early postnatal liver development to prevent hepatocellular carcinoma (Kent2016E2f8).

## Clinical Significance
E2F8 is implicated in various cancers due to its role in cell cycle regulation and transcriptional activation. In lung cancer, E2F8 is overexpressed, contributing to tumor growth and poor prognosis. Its knockdown in lung cancer cells leads to decreased viability and tumor growth, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Park2015E2F8). E2F8 also regulates UHRF1, a gene overexpressed in several cancers, further linking it to oncogenic processes (Park2015E2F8).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), E2F8 acts as a tumor suppressor. Its loss leads to increased E2F transcriptional activity, genomic instability, and HCC development in mice. E2F8's role in maintaining DNA replication quality is crucial for preventing liver cancer (Kent2016E2f8). Elevated E2F8 expression is observed in human liver tumors, correlating with proliferation markers (Kent2016E2f8).

In ovarian cancer, high E2F8 mRNA levels are associated with poor overall and progression-free survival, indicating its role in tumor progression (Zhou2019E2F258). E2F8 is also linked to insulin secretion and hyperglycemia, with a polymorphism in E2F8 associated with glucose intolerance and obesity-related traits (Yang2020E2f8).

## Interactions
E2F8 is involved in specific interactions with both proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in transcriptional regulation. E2F8, along with E2F7, binds to E2F-binding sites on the promoters of target genes such as E2f1 and cdc6, as demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. This binding is specific, as shown by the inability of mutant forms of E2F7 or E2F8 to bind DNA (Li2008Synergistic). E2F8 can form homo- and heterodimers with E2F7, allowing them to occupy E2F-binding sites on target promoters, which is essential for their function in transcriptional repression (Li2008Synergistic).

Structurally, E2F8 binds DNA through two DNA-binding domains (DBDs), forming a symmetric interaction surface between two E2F domains. This interaction involves conserved residues and is supported by hydrophobic interactions, allowing E2F8 to bind effectively to DNA (Morgunova2015Structural). E2F8 recognizes a specific DNA sequence, 5'-GGCGGG-3', by inserting helices into the major groove of DNA, with additional contacts in the minor grooves (Morgunova2015Structural). These interactions highlight E2F8's role as a transcriptional repressor, influencing cell cycle regulation and development.
