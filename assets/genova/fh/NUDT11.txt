# NUDT11

## Overview
NUDT11 is a gene that encodes the protein nudix hydrolase 11, a member of the nudix hydrolase family, which is involved in the hydrolysis of diphosphoinositol polyphosphates. These polyphosphates are associated with various cellular processes, including vesicle trafficking, stress responses, DNA repair, and apoptosis (Hidaka2002An). The protein, also known as hDIPP3β, exhibits higher enzymatic activity in vitro compared to its paralog hDIPP3α, suggesting a prominent role in the regulation of polyphosphate turnover (Hidaka2002An). NUDT11 is predominantly expressed in the testis and brain, indicating a potential role in tissue-specific functions (HUA2003Paralogous). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and may influence signal transduction and energy metabolism by maintaining nucleotide pool balance (CarrerasPuigvert2017A). NUDT11 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer, with genetic variants linked to increased cancer risk, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Grisanzio2012Genetic).

## Function
NUDT11, a member of the nudix hydrolase family, is involved in the hydrolysis of diphosphoinositol polyphosphates, which are linked to various cellular processes such as vesicle trafficking, stress responses, DNA repair, and apoptosis (Hidaka2002An). The enzyme encoded by NUDT11, known as hDIPP3β, is more active in vitro compared to its paralog hDIPP3α, suggesting a significant role in regulating the turnover of these polyphosphates (Hidaka2002An). NUDT11 is primarily expressed in the testis and brain, indicating a potential role in tissue-specific hydrolysis of diphosphoinositol polyphosphates (HUA2003Paralogous).

In healthy human cells, NUDT11 is active in the cytoplasm and may influence processes like signal transduction and energy metabolism by maintaining nucleotide pool balance (CarrerasPuigvert2017A). The enzyme's activity is crucial for eliminating potentially harmful nucleotide derivatives, thus contributing to cellular metabolism (CarrerasPuigvert2017A). Despite its significant enzymatic activity, the specific substrates for NUDT11 remain unclear, suggesting that further research is needed to fully understand its function under different conditions (CarrerasPuigvert2017A).

## Clinical Significance
NUDT11 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer. Genetic variants associated with increased expression of NUDT11 have been linked to a higher risk of prostate cancer, suggesting that alterations in its expression may contribute to tumorigenesis (Grisanzio2012Genetic). Functional studies have shown that suppression of NUDT11 in prostate cancer cell lines, such as LNCaP, significantly inhibits cell proliferation and colony formation, indicating its role in cancer cell growth and viability (Grisanzio2012Genetic). 

In addition to prostate cancer, NUDT11 is essential for cell survival in various cancer cell lines, including those from lung, breast, and colon cancers. Depletion of NUDT11 results in a lethal phenotype, highlighting its potential importance in cancer biology (CarrerasPuigvert2017A). The study of NUDIX hydrolases, including NUDT11, suggests that these enzymes may play a role in cell cycle regulation, possibly through nucleotide pool imbalance leading to DNA lesions (CarrerasPuigvert2017A).

While the specific clinical significance of NUDT11 gene mutations or interaction changes is not fully detailed, its expression alterations and functional roles in cancer cells underscore its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention in cancer treatment (CarrerasPuigvert2017A).
