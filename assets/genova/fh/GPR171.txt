# GPR171

## Overview
GPR171 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 171, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in various physiological processes. This receptor is primarily expressed in the central nervous system and is involved in regulating food intake, body weight, and pain modulation. GPR171 acts as a receptor for the neuropeptide BigLEN and is implicated in the modulation of opioid receptor signaling, particularly enhancing the effects of morphine-induced antinociception. Additionally, GPR171 is involved in anxiety and fear conditioning, with its activity influencing behaviors in the basolateral amygdala. The receptor's interactions with other proteins, such as GPR83, and its role in immune response modulation further underscore its significance in complex signaling networks. Alterations in GPR171 expression have been linked to various clinical conditions, including pediatric high-risk B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia and ovarian cancer, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Wardman2016Identification; McDermott2019OpioidInduced; Fujiwara2021The).

## Function
GPR171 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in several key physiological processes, primarily within the central nervous system. It is a receptor for the neuropeptide BigLEN, derived from proSAAS, and plays a significant role in regulating food intake and body weight. GPR171 is expressed in the hypothalamus, particularly in regions associated with feeding behaviors, such as the arcuate nucleus and the paraventricular nucleus (Wardman2016Identification). Activation of GPR171 by its ligand BigLEN or small-molecule agonists like MS0015203 has been shown to increase food intake and body weight in animal models, suggesting an orexigenic function (Wardman2016Identification).

In addition to its role in feeding, GPR171 is involved in modulating opioid receptor signaling, particularly in the periaqueductal gray (PAG) area of the brain, which is crucial for pain modulation. GPR171 influences the signaling of the mu-opioid receptor (MOPr), enhancing morphine-induced antinociception, which suggests its potential as a target for pain management therapies (McDermott2019OpioidInduced). GPR171 is also implicated in anxiety and fear conditioning, with its activity in the basolateral amygdala affecting these behaviors (Bobeck2017The).

## Clinical Significance
GPR171 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In pediatric high-risk B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), high levels of GPR171 expression are associated with extremely poor survival rates. This is linked to unique genetic features and expression signatures, including several DNA copy number variations and deletions in genes such as EBF1 and IKZF1 (Harvey2010Identification). 

In the context of neurological functions, GPR171 is involved in regulating food intake and anxiety-like behaviors. Knockdown of GPR171 in the mouse hypothalamus affects food intake, while its reduction in the amygdala decreases anxiety-like behaviors and fear conditioning. This suggests that alterations in GPR171 expression or function could contribute to conditions such as obesity and anxiety (Fricker2018Orphan).

In ovarian cancer, GPR171 is mainly expressed in CD8 T cells and is part of a prognostic model related to copper metabolism. Its expression may influence the course and prognosis of the disease, although specific mutations or alterations in GPR171 related to ovarian cancer are not detailed (Zhao2023Identification).

## Interactions
GPR171, a G protein-coupled receptor, is known to interact with other proteins, influencing various physiological processes. One notable interaction is with GPR83, another receptor with which GPR171 can co-localize in certain brain regions. These two receptors can form dimers, leading to unique signaling pathways distinct from those activated by the individual receptors (Fricker2018Orphan). This dimerization suggests a mechanism of receptor-receptor interaction that modulates signaling pathways.

In the context of opioid signaling, GPR171 modulates the signaling of the mu-opioid receptor (MOPr). Although GPR171 does not directly bind to MOPr, it influences the signaling potency of MOPr agonists like DAMGO. This modulation is evident in cells coexpressing both receptors, where GPR171 affects the signaling pathways without direct physical interaction (McDermott2019OpioidInduced).

GPR171 also interacts with its endogenous ligand, BigLEN, to suppress T cell activation and limit antitumor immunity. This interaction inhibits TCR-mediated signaling pathways, including calcium flux and NFAT activation, indicating a role in immune response modulation (Fujiwara2021The). These interactions highlight GPR171's involvement in complex signaling networks across different physiological systems.
