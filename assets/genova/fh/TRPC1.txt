# TRPC1

## Overview
TRPC1 is a gene that encodes the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily C member 1, a protein that belongs to the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family. This protein functions as a non-selective cation channel and plays a pivotal role in store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), a critical mechanism for calcium influx following the depletion of calcium stores in the endoplasmic reticulum. TRPC1 is involved in various physiological processes, including signal transduction, cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. It forms complexes with other proteins such as STIM1 and Orai1, which are essential for its activation and function. The protein's interactions and regulatory mechanisms are crucial for maintaining cellular calcium homeostasis and have significant implications in health and disease, including cancer and metabolic disorders (Ambudkar2017TRPC1; Schnipper2022The; Schaar2019Ca2+).

## Structure
The TRPC1 protein is a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family and is characterized by a complex molecular structure. It consists of six transmembrane helices (S1-S6) and a pore-forming loop between the fifth and sixth segments, which includes negatively charged amino acids and a putative selectivity filter (SYGEE) (Dietrich2014Classical). The protein has intracellular N- and C-termini, with the C-terminus containing a TRP box of unknown function and a calmodulin binding domain that overlaps with an IP3 receptor-binding domain (Dietrich2014Classical).

TRPC1 features several domains, including ankyrin repeats, coiled-coil domains, and calmodulin binding domains, which are important for protein-protein interactions and subunit oligomerization (Beech2003TRPC1). The protein can form tetramers, similar to voltage-gated calcium channels, with a common pore in the middle (Dietrich2014Classical). It is known to form heteromultimers with other TRPC family members, such as TRPC4 and TRPC5, and potentially with polycystin-2 (Beech2003TRPC1).

Post-translational modifications of TRPC1 include phosphorylation at consensus sites for protein kinases A, C, and tyrosine kinase, which are crucial for its regulation (Beech2003TRPC1). Glycosylation also affects the protein's size and function in native tissues (Dietrich2014Classical). The presence of multiple splice variants, including α and β forms, adds to the complexity of TRPC1's structure and function (Dietrich2014Classical).

## Function
TRPC1 is a non-selective cation channel that plays a critical role in store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), a key pathway for calcium influx in response to the depletion of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium stores. In healthy human cells, TRPC1 is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell proliferation, and differentiation. It forms part of a complex with STIM1 and Orai1, which are essential for its activation and function. TRPC1 modifies the calcium signal generated by Orai1, contributing to the creation of specific calcium microdomains that regulate distinct cellular functions (Ambudkar2017TRPC1).

TRPC1 is crucial for adipocyte differentiation and metabolic regulation. It facilitates calcium entry necessary for the exocytosis of adipokine-loaded vesicles, impacting adipokine secretion and metabolic homeostasis (Schaar2019Ca2+). In endothelial cells, TRPC1, in conjunction with TRPC4, forms a channel that regulates endothelial permeability and nitric oxide release, which are vital for vascular function (Moccia2023The).

TRPC1 also influences cell migration by generating a lamellipodial calcium gradient, essential for directional movement and efficient migration (Fabian2008TRPC1). Its role in calcium signaling extends to the regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathways, impacting cell proliferation and migration (Tajeddine2012TRPC1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the TRPC1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), TRPC1 is significantly upregulated, especially in the aggressive basal-like subtype, and is associated with poor prognosis and lower overall survival rates. Its overexpression in PDAC cell lines correlates with increased cell proliferation and tumor growth, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Schnipper2022The).

In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), low TRPC1 expression is linked to increased tumor cell proliferation, metastasis, and poor differentiation, serving as an independent prognostic factor for worse disease-free and overall survival (Zeng2021TRPC1). TRPC1 also plays a role in breast cancer, where its expression is upregulated in certain aggressive subtypes, contributing to poor clinical outcomes (Elzamzamy2020The).

Beyond cancer, TRPC1 is involved in diabetic complications, such as diabetic nephropathy, where its reduced expression is associated with renal fibrosis and impaired glomerular function (Smani2015Functional). In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, TRPC1 depletion is linked to neurodegeneration and cognitive deficits, highlighting its broader significance in human health (Chen2020Transient).

## Interactions
TRPC1 interacts with a variety of proteins that are crucial for its function in calcium signaling. It forms complexes with STIM1 and Orai1, which are essential for store-operated calcium entry (SOCE). STIM1 interacts with TRPC1 through electrostatic interactions, facilitating its activation following calcium store depletion (Ong2017STIMTRP; Zeng2008STIM1). TRPC1 also associates with caveolin-1 (Cav-1), a scaffolding protein that regulates its localization and activity. Under resting conditions, TRPC1 is bound to Cav-1, and this interaction is disrupted upon ER-Ca2+ store depletion, allowing TRPC1 to be activated by STIM1 (Ong2017STIMTRP).

TRPC1 interacts with the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R), and this association is modulated by proteins like Homer1, which maintains TRPC1 in an inactive state under resting conditions (Ong2017STIMTRP). In endothelial cells, TRPC1 forms a complex with RhoA and IP3R upon thrombin stimulation, which is crucial for its translocation to the plasma membrane and subsequent SOCE (Ong2017STIMTRP).

TRPC1 also interacts with other TRP channels, such as TRPC3, forming heteromeric complexes that play roles in calcium signaling during myogenesis (Cheung2011Expression). These interactions highlight the diverse regulatory mechanisms involving TRPC1 in cellular calcium homeostasis.
