# CRELD2

## Overview
CRELD2 is a gene that encodes the protein cysteine-rich with EGF-like domains 2, which is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and functions as a chaperone protein. This protein is characterized by its epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like and calcium-binding EGF-like domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and are crucial for its role in cellular processes. CRELD2 is involved in the modulation of noncanonical WNT signaling pathways, particularly influencing skeletal development by promoting the membrane expression of the receptor LRP1. It plays a significant role in the differentiation and maturation of chondrocytes and osteoblasts, essential for proper bone formation and maintenance. Additionally, CRELD2 is implicated in various pathological conditions, including skeletal disorders, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases, often through its involvement in ER stress responses (Dennis2020CRELD2; Tang2023CRELD2).

## Structure
CRELD2 is a protein encoded by the CRELD2 gene, characterized by its composition of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like and calcium-binding EGF-like repeats. These domains are involved in protein-protein interactions and are a hallmark of the CRELD family of proteins, which also includes CRELD1 (Dennis2020CRELD2). The protein contains a unique and highly conserved tryptophan-aspartic acid (WE) domain, which is significant for its function (Dennis2020CRELD2).

The primary structure of CRELD2 is rich in cysteine residues, which are crucial for forming disulfide bonds that stabilize its tertiary structure. The secondary structure likely includes beta-sheets and alpha-helices, common in proteins with EGF-like domains. CRELD2 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is secreted during ER stress, facilitated by an imperfect C-terminal KDEL ER-retention sequence (REDL) (Dennis2020CRELD2).

CRELD2 has five identified human isoforms, each with varying numbers of EGF-like domains, indicating the presence of splice variant isoforms (Dennis2020CRELD2). Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, may occur, although specific details are not provided in the context. The protein's role as a chaperone in promoting the membrane expression of LRP1 and its involvement in WNT signaling pathways highlight its functional significance in skeletal development (Dennis2020CRELD2).

## Function
CRELD2 is a protein that plays a significant role in skeletal development by modulating noncanonical WNT signaling pathways. It functions as a chaperone for LRP1, a receptor involved in skeletal development, facilitating its membrane expression and thereby influencing WNT signaling during chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) (Dennis2020CRELD2). CRELD2 is crucial for the proper differentiation and maturation of chondrocytes and osteoblasts, as evidenced by its role in promoting WNT4 signaling via the noncanonical p38 MAPK pathway. This signaling is essential for chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation, and its disruption leads to impaired differentiation processes (Dennis2020CRELD2).

In healthy human cells, CRELD2 is active in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is involved in protein folding and processing. It binds to various proteins, including collagen prolyl-hydroxylases and collagen alpha chains, indicating its role in maintaining proper protein function and cellular homeostasis (Dennis2020CRELD2). CRELD2's involvement in these molecular processes underscores its importance in maintaining the structural integrity and function of skeletal tissues.

## Clinical Significance
The CRELD2 gene is implicated in various diseases and conditions, primarily through its role in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses. In skeletal disorders, CRELD2 is highly upregulated in chondrocytes from models of multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED), a chondrodysplasia characterized by short stature and joint issues. It is also upregulated in ER stress-related growth plate diseases, such as Schmid and Cog, which are marked by prolonged ER stress (Dennis2020CRELD2; Tang2023CRELD2). CRELD2 acts as a chaperone for LRP1, modulating WNT signaling during chondrocyte and osteoblast differentiation, and its deletion in cartilage leads to disrupted ossification and skeletal abnormalities (Dennis2020CRELD2).

In cancer, CRELD2 expression is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis in renal cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. It is also a novel androgen receptor target in prostate cancer and is involved in breast cancer progression through the ROCK-PERK-ATF4-CRELD2 axis (Tang2023CRELD2). In cardiovascular diseases, CRELD2 is upregulated in conditions like Marfan syndrome and is linked to ER stress responses in vascular diseases (Tang2023CRELD2). CRELD2 is also identified as a biomarker for ER stress-mediated kidney diseases, detectable in urine before clinical symptoms appear (Kim2017Elevated).

## Interactions
CRELD2 is known to interact with various proteins, primarily within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It specifically interacts with the large cytoplasmic domains of the human neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) α4 and β2 subunits, but not with the α3 or α7 subunits. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of α4β2 nAChR expression and transport to the cell membrane (Ortiz2005The).

CRELD2 also binds to DNAJ proteins, peptidyl prolyl-isomerases (PPIs), and protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs), which are involved in protein folding and processing, confirming its role as an ER-resident chaperone (Dennis2020CRELD2). It interacts with protein complexes involved in collagen fibril processing, such as collagen prolyl-hydroxylases and several collagen alpha chains, indicating a role in collagen folding (Dennis2020CRELD2).

Additionally, CRELD2 forms mixed disulfide complexes with structural proteins like laminin-5 b3, collagen a1(VI) and a3(VI), thrombospondin-1, and integrin a-3, as well as with chaperones and PDIs such as BiP/GRP78, GRP94, and PDIA1, -3, and -6 (Hartley2013ArmetManf). These interactions suggest CRELD2's involvement in protein folding and ER stress response.
