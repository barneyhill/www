# PRKD2

## Overview
PRKD2 is a gene that encodes the protein kinase D2 (PKD2), a serine/threonine kinase involved in a variety of cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell proliferation, and survival. PKD2 is characterized by its modular structure, which includes regulatory domains such as cysteine-rich diacylglycerol-binding C1 domains and a pleckstrin homology domain, as well as a C-terminal kinase domain responsible for its catalytic activity (Azoitei2017Protein). The protein plays a significant role in regulating insulin secretion, cell cycle progression, and T-lymphocyte function, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and immune responses (Roy2018Protein; Xiao2018Deficiency; Matthews2010Unique). PKD2's interactions with various proteins, such as AMAP1 and the Arp2/3 complex, further underscore its involvement in processes like actin cytoskeleton organization and cancer cell invasion (Onodera2012Rab5c; Häupl2016Protein). Mutations in the PRKD2 gene have been linked to diseases such as angiolipomas and metabolic disorders, emphasizing its clinical significance (Xiao2018Deficiency; Hofvander2017Frequent).

## Structure
Protein kinase D2 (PKD2) is a serine/threonine kinase characterized by a modular structure that includes several distinct domains. The N-terminal regulatory domain of PKD2 contains two cysteine-rich diacylglycerol (DAG)-binding C1 domains and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which is auto-inhibitory (Azoitei2017Protein). The C1 domains are crucial for the regulation of PKD2 activity, and their deletion results in the loss of kinase activity. The PH domain, when deleted, leads to increased kinase activity, indicating its role in auto-inhibition (Azoitei2017Protein).

PKD2 also contains a C-terminal kinase domain responsible for its catalytic activity. The protein is 878 amino acids long and has a molecular weight of approximately 105 kDa (Azoitei2017Protein). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating PKD2's activity. Key phosphorylation sites include Ser706 and Ser710 in the activation loop, and an autophosphorylation site at Ser876. Additionally, phosphorylation at Ser244 by casein kinase 1 facilitates nuclear import, while phosphorylation at tyrosine residues like Tyr717 and Tyr87 occurs under oxidative stress conditions (Azoitei2017Protein).

The C-terminal tail of PKD2 is crucial for its intracellular distribution, preventing nuclear localization, unlike PKD3, which lacks this inhibitory signal (Papazyan2006The).

## Function
Protein kinase D2 (PRKD2) is a serine/threonine kinase involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell proliferation, and survival. In healthy human cells, PRKD2 plays a critical role in the regulation of insulin secretion and metabolic processes. It modulates insulin secretion by enhancing calcium influx through L-type Ca2+ channels, which is crucial for insulin exocytosis in pancreatic β-cells. This regulation is significant for maintaining glucose homeostasis and preventing metabolic disorders (Xiao2018Deficiency).

PRKD2 is also involved in cell cycle regulation, particularly during the G2-M transition. It stabilizes Aurora A kinase at centrosomes, which is essential for proper mitotic entry and progression. This stabilization prevents premature degradation of Aurora A, ensuring accurate cell cycle progression and mitotic fidelity (Roy2018Protein).

In the immune system, PRKD2 is important for T-lymphocyte function. It is phosphorylated upon T-cell receptor engagement, enhancing its catalytic activity, which is necessary for efficient cytokine production and optimal T-cell-dependent antibody responses (Matthews2010Unique).

PRKD2 is active in both the cytoplasm and Golgi apparatus, where it interacts with components of the cytoskeleton and signaling pathways, influencing cellular processes such as actin cytoskeleton organization and signal transduction (Häupl2016Protein).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PRKD2 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In angiolipomas, a subtype of adipocytic tumors, mutations in the PRKD2 gene are frequently observed. These mutations are primarily located in the catalytic kinase domain and are present in 80% of angiolipomas, suggesting a significant role in the pathogenesis of these tumors. The mutations are thought to interfere with substrate binding, potentially affecting kinase activity and promoting tumorigenesis and vessel formation characteristic of angiolipomas (Hofvander2017Frequent).

PRKD2 deficiency has also been linked to metabolic disorders. In studies involving PRKD2 knockout mice and rhesus monkeys, a deficiency in PRKD2 was associated with hyperinsulinemia, obesity, and insulin resistance. This condition is attributed to enhanced insulin secretion due to increased Ca2+ influx through L-type Ca2+ channels, which is crucial for insulin exocytosis. The findings suggest that PRKD2 plays a critical role in regulating insulin secretion and that its deficiency can lead to metabolic disorders (Xiao2018Deficiency).

## Interactions
Protein kinase D2 (PRKD2) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. PRKD2 forms a complex with AMAP1 and β1 integrins, which is essential for β1 integrin recycling and cancer cell invasion. This interaction is enhanced by EGF stimulation, which increases the coprecipitation of PRKD2 with AMAP1, indicating a role in EGFR signaling (Onodera2012Rab5c).

PRKD2 also interacts with the Arp2/3 complex, which is involved in actin polymerization and cell motility. This interaction suggests a regulatory assembly involving nucleation promoting factors and phosphorylation (Häupl2016Protein). Additionally, PRKD2 interacts with glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3B), which is involved in endothelial cell morphogenesis, and 14-3-3 protein gamma, potentially related to cortactin phosphorylation (Häupl2016Protein).

At the trans-Golgi network (TGN), PRKD2 is part of a multiprotein complex that includes ARF1, ARL1, and Arfaptin2, which regulates the secretion of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). PRKD2 interacts with ARF1 and ARL1, recruiting them to the TGN, and indirectly recruits Arfaptin2, facilitating vesicle formation and secretion processes (Eiseler2016Protein).
