# DDAH2

## Overview
Dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 2 (DDAH2) is a gene that encodes a member of the dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase family, specifically the enzyme DDAH2, which is distinct from its counterpart DDAH1. Unlike DDAH1, DDAH2 does not metabolize asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) in human cells, a function traditionally attributed to this enzyme family. Instead, DDAH2 is involved in various physiological processes that are independent of ADMA metabolism, such as the regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, insulin secretion, and immune responses (Ragavan2023A). Predominantly expressed in vascular tissues, DDAH2 plays a crucial role in maintaining vascular homeostasis and endothelial function, contributing to processes like angiogenesis and vascular permeability (Ragavan2023A). The enzyme's activity is mediated through protein-protein interactions and other mechanisms, highlighting its significance in cardiovascular health and disease (Ragavan2023A).

## Structure


## Function
The DDAH2 gene encodes the enzyme dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 2, which has been traditionally thought to play a role in the metabolism of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS). However, recent studies have shown that DDAH2 does not metabolize ADMA in human cells, unlike its counterpart DDAH1, which effectively hydrolyzes ADMA to citrulline (Ragavan2023A). Despite this, DDAH2 is involved in various physiological processes independent of ADMA metabolism. It is implicated in the regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, insulin secretion, and immune responses, which are mediated through pathways not directly related to nitric oxide (NO) production (Ragavan2023A).

DDAH2 is primarily expressed in vascular tissues and plays a role in maintaining vascular homeostasis and endothelial function. It is involved in processes such as angiogenesis, vascular permeability, and cellular growth, which are crucial for cardiovascular health (Ragavan2023A). The enzyme's activity is thought to be mediated through protein-protein interactions and other mechanisms that do not involve direct ADMA degradation (Ragavan2023A).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the DDAH2 gene have been implicated in several psychiatric and cardiovascular conditions. In psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, DDAH2 expression is upregulated in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, with specific methylations and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in its promoter region linked to these conditions (Kozlova2022Assessment). The co-expression of DDAH2 with genes related to developmental mental disorders is disrupted in these patients, suggesting a potential role in cognitive functions and synapse organization (Kozlova2022Assessment).

In cardiovascular health, DDAH2 is involved in the regulation of nitric oxide (NO) production, which is crucial for vascular function. Although DDAH2 does not metabolize asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), it may have ADMA-independent roles in processes such as angiogenesis and vascular remodeling (Ragavan2023A). In lung adenocarcinoma, DDAH2 expression is associated with tumor angiogenesis and poor prognosis, indicating its role in tumor progression (Shiozawa2015Dimethylarginine). Despite its involvement in NO regulation, specific polymorphisms in DDAH2 were not found to be associated with coronary heart disease, highlighting the complexity of its role in cardiovascular diseases (XU2012Association).

## Interactions
DDAH2 does not form stable interactions with asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), unlike DDAH1, which binds stably to ADMA. Studies using MicroScale Thermophoresis (MST) have shown that ADMA binds stably to DDAH1 but not to DDAH2, indicating an unstable and/or nonspecific interaction with DDAH2 (Ragavan2023A). Molecular docking and dynamics simulations further support that ADMA does not bind efficiently to DDAH2's predicted substrate binding site, and DDAH2 lacks the catalytic triad necessary for ADMA metabolism (Ragavan2023A).

While DDAH2 does not directly interact with ADMA as a substrate, it may influence DDAH1 activity indirectly, possibly by modulating endogenous regulators (Ragavan2023A). The role of DDAH2 in ADMA metabolism is less clear, with some studies suggesting that DDAH2 may require additional cofactors or protein-protein interactions to function, as its activity is not easily replicated in vitro (Hulin2020Inhibition).

The regulation of DDAH2 expression involves interactions with transcription factors such as NF-κB. NF-κB acetylation enhances its binding to an NF-κB element upstream of DDAH2 transcripts, increasing promoter activity and upregulating DDAH2 mRNA and protein expression (Li2020Regulation).
