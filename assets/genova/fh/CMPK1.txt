# CMPK1

## Overview
CMPK1, or cytidine/uridine monophosphate kinase 1, is a gene that encodes a crucial enzyme involved in nucleotide metabolism. The protein product of CMPK1 is a kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation of cytidine monophosphate (CMP), uridine monophosphate (UMP), and deoxycytidine monophosphate (dCMP) to their respective diphosphate forms, playing a vital role in both the de novo and salvage pathways of nucleotide synthesis (SeguraPeña2004Substrateinduced; Chen2017Identification). This enzymatic activity is essential for DNA and RNA synthesis, making CMPK1 indispensable for cellular proliferation and repair processes (Van1999Phosphorylation). The enzyme's structural flexibility, characterized by significant conformational changes during its catalytic cycle, allows it to efficiently phosphorylate its substrates (SeguraPeña2004Substrateinduced). CMPK1 also plays a role in the activation of nucleoside analogs used in antiviral and anticancer therapies, underscoring its therapeutic significance (Chen2017Identification).

## Function
The CMPK1 gene encodes the UMP/CMP kinase 1 enzyme, which plays a critical role in nucleotide metabolism by catalyzing the phosphorylation of cytidine monophosphate (CMP), uridine monophosphate (UMP), and deoxycytidine monophosphate (dCMP) to their respective diphosphate forms. This enzymatic activity is essential for both the de novo and salvage pathways of nucleotide synthesis, which are crucial for DNA and RNA synthesis in cells (SeguraPeña2004Substrateinduced; Chen2017Identification).

CMPK1 operates primarily in the cytoplasm, where it uses adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as a phosphate donor in the presence of magnesium ions. The enzyme's activity is vital for cellular proliferation and repair processes, as it ensures a steady supply of nucleotide diphosphates necessary for nucleic acid synthesis (Van1999Phosphorylation).

The enzyme also undergoes significant conformational changes during its catalytic cycle, transitioning from an open to a closed state upon substrate binding. This structural flexibility is crucial for its function, allowing the enzyme to adopt a catalytically competent state and efficiently phosphorylate its substrates (SeguraPeña2004Substrateinduced). CMPK1's role extends to the activation of nucleoside analogs used in antiviral and anticancer therapies, highlighting its importance in therapeutic contexts (Chen2017Identification).

## Clinical Significance
CMPK1 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in nucleotide metabolism. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CMPK1 is identified as a critical gene for tumor cell growth, with its overexpression associated with lower survival rates. It is also a target for FDA-approved cancer drugs like Gemcitabine, Lamivudine, and Sofosbuvir, which are used to treat viral infection-induced HCC (Sun2020Mechanistic). 

Mutations in CMPK1 can lead to drug resistance, particularly in the context of resistance to the nucleotide analogue cidofovir (CDV) in HPV-positive cells. Specific mutations, such as P64T and R134M, impair the enzyme's ability to phosphorylate CDV, contributing to resistance (Topalis2016Resistance). These mutations affect the enzyme's stability and activity, leading to reduced drug activation and altered cellular growth rates (Topalis2016Resistance).

CMPK1 is also involved in the metabolism of chemotherapeutic agents like cytarabine arabinoside (Ara-C), used in treating acute myeloid leukemia (AML). While the study did not find direct associations with CMPK1 mutations, it highlights the gene's role in drug metabolism pathways (Zhu2018Association).

## Interactions
CMPK1, also known as cytidine/uridine monophosphate kinase 1, is involved in nucleotide metabolism and interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids. A notable interaction is with the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX). CMPK1 was identified as a binding target for DOX using a high-density protein microarray, which screened 17,950 human proteins. The binding interaction was confirmed through microscale thermophoresis, showing that DOX binds to CMPK1 with a dissociation constant (K_d) of 1.2 ± 0.5 µM (Chen2017Identification).

The binding of DOX to CMPK1 activates the phosphorylation of CMP, dCMP, and UMP, with significant activation observed at a concentration of 30 µM DOX. This suggests that DOX may bind to a nonactive site of CMPK1 and regulate its activity in the presence of magnesium (Chen2017Identification). CMPK1 is also involved in the activation of deoxynucleoside analogs, which are important antiviral and anticancer agents (Chen2017Identification).

In the presence of other factors like gemcitabine, a CMP analog, DOX can reverse the inhibition of CMPK1 activity caused by gemcitabine. This indicates a regulatory interaction where DOX modulates CMPK1 activity in the context of other compounds (Chen2017Identification).
