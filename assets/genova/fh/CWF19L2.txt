# CWF19L2

## Overview
CWF19L2 is a gene that encodes the protein CWF19-like cell cycle control factor 2, which is integral to the human spliceosome, particularly during the late stages of the splicing cycle. This protein is involved in the disassembly of the spliceosome and the debranching of intron lariat RNA, processes essential for proper RNA splicing and subsequent gene expression. CWF19-like cell cycle control factor 2 interacts with various domains of the Prp8 protein and RNA elements, utilizing a positively charged surface to facilitate these interactions. This protein is categorized as a spliceosomal component due to its role in the structural reorganization and stabilization of spliceosome components. The gene's function and its encoded protein's interactions are critical for maintaining normal cellular processes, and disruptions in CWF19L2 have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer, underscoring its importance in cell cycle regulation and potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2019Structures; Casalino2018Allatom; Covelo-Molares2021The).

## Structure


## Function
CWF19L2 is a protein involved in the human spliceosome, particularly during the late stages of the splicing cycle. It plays a significant role in spliceosome disassembly and intron lariat RNA debranching. CWF19L2 interacts closely with the lariat junction at the splicing active site and directly contacts various domains of Prp8, employing a positively charged surface to interact with RNA elements, which is crucial for the splicing process (Zhang2019Structures). The protein is involved in the displacement and unwinding of the intron lariat/U2 helix, a critical step for the debranching and degradation of the intron lariat. This process is facilitated by electrostatic interactions, forming a positively charged cavity that acts as an electrostatic trap for the negatively charged nucleotides of U2 and the intron lariat (Casalino2018Allatom).

CWF19L2 is also implicated in the structural reorganization and stabilization of spliceosome components during the splicing process. It is recruited into the space between Prp8 and the intron lariat, helping to stabilize the conformation of Prp8 and the intron lariat in the ILS1 complex (Zhang2019Structures). The precise functional annotation of CWF19L2 requires further biochemical investigation (Zhang2019Structures).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the CWF19L2 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer. Disruptions in the normal function of CWF19L2 can lead to abnormal cell proliferation and differentiation, which are critical factors in the pathogenesis of these conditions. In neurodevelopmental disorders, changes in CWF19L2 expression may affect the regulation of the cell cycle, potentially leading to developmental abnormalities. In cancer, the gene's role in cell cycle control suggests that its dysregulation could contribute to uncontrolled cell growth and tumor development. The precise mechanisms by which CWF19L2 mutations or expression changes lead to these diseases are still under investigation, but the gene's involvement in cell cycle regulation highlights its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention. Understanding the interactions and pathways affected by CWF19L2 alterations is crucial for developing strategies to mitigate its impact on disease progression.

## Interactions
CWF19L2 is involved in several interactions within the human spliceosome, particularly during the late stages of the splicing cycle. It plays a significant role in spliceosome disassembly and intron lariat RNA debranching. CWF19L2 interacts closely with the lariat junction at the splicing active site and directly contacts the RNaseH-like, Linker/Endo, and N-domain of Prp8. The protein uses a positively charged surface to interact with RNA elements, which is crucial for its function (Zhang2019Structures).

In the ILS1 complex, CWF19L2 is recruited into the space between Prp8 and the intron lariat, interacting with four domains of Prp8. These interactions contribute to the formation of the putative exon release tunnel and stabilize the conformation of Prp8 and the intron lariat (Zhang2019Structures). CWF19L2 also plays a role in the displacement and unrolling of the IL/U2 helix, facilitated by electrostatic interactions. Specific residues of CWF19L2 form a polar tweezers that anchor the branch point region, aiding in the unrolling of the branch helix (Casalino2018Allatom).

CWF19L2 is part of the excised lariat intron U2/U5/U6 complex in yeast, suggesting its involvement in splicing processes (Covelo-Molares2021The).
