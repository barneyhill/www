# PIK3C3

## Overview
The PIK3C3 gene encodes the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit type 3, a class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) that plays a pivotal role in cellular processes such as autophagy and endosomal trafficking. This kinase is integral to the production of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P), a lipid that is crucial for the recruitment and function of autophagy-related proteins. PIK3C3 forms part of a complex with other proteins, including Beclin 1 and Vps15, which modulate its activity and influence various cellular pathways. The protein's involvement in autophagy and endosomal sorting underscores its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases characterized by dysregulated autophagy and trafficking (Raiborg2013Class; Backer2008The).

## Structure
The PIK3C3 protein, also known as the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, is a key component in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway. Its molecular structure includes a catalytic domain responsible for the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol to produce phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P), a crucial signaling lipid involved in autophagy and endocytic trafficking (Raiborg2013Class; Backer2008The). The protein also contains regulatory regions, including a C2 domain, a helical domain, and a kinase domain. The C2 domain is involved in interactions with acidic phospholipids, while the helical domain plays a regulatory role (Backer2008The).

PIK3C3 forms complexes with other proteins, such as Vps15, Beclin 1, and Atg14, which influence its quaternary structure and function. These complexes are involved in different cellular processes, including autophagy and vacuolar protein sorting (Young2019Structural; Reidick2016The). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as autophosphorylation, which may regulate its activity, although the specific sites and effects are not fully determined (Backer2008The). The structural insights into PIK3C3 have facilitated the development of specific inhibitors, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Yu2015Differential).

## Function
PIK3C3, also known as Vps34, is a class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase that plays a crucial role in autophagy, a cellular degradation process essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. It functions as the core catalytic subunit in the class III PtdIns3K complex, responsible for producing phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P), a lipid critical for autophagy and endosomal trafficking (Yu2015Differential; Jaber2012Class). PIK3C3 is involved in the nucleation stage of autophagy by generating PtdIns3P at the nucleation site, facilitating the recruitment and localization of autophagy-related proteins, and aiding in the elongation and maturation of the autophagosome (Yu2015Differential).

PIK3C3 interacts with proteins such as BECN1 and ATG14, which are essential for autophagosome formation and function. BECN1 is necessary for PIK3C3 activity, and its interaction is modulated by various phosphorylation events (Yu2015Differential). PIK3C3 also plays a role in endosomal sorting and trafficking, influencing processes like lysosomal function and MTORC1 activation (Backer2008The). In the context of nutrient sensing, PIK3C3 is implicated in MTOR signaling, affecting cellular growth and survival (Yu2015Differential).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PIK3C3 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In sensory neurons, the deletion of PIK3C3 leads to rapid neurodegeneration, primarily due to disruptions in the endosomal pathway rather than the autophagic pathway. This results in the accumulation of vacuoles and ubiquitin-positive aggregates in large-diameter myelinated neurons, while small-diameter unmyelinated neurons accumulate lysosome-like organelles and degenerate more slowly (Zhou2010Deletion).

In the context of autoimmune diseases, PIK3C3 plays a significant role in the immune response. Its deficiency in dendritic cells and T cells has been associated with resistance to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for multiple sclerosis. This resistance is linked to impaired T cell activation and differentiation, particularly affecting CD4+ T cells, which fail to differentiate into Th1 cells (Yang2020Autophagyrelated). PIK3C3 deficiency in myeloid cells also leads to partial resistance to EAE, associated with reduced IL-1β production and impaired macrophage function (Yang2020Pik3c3).

Alterations in PIK3C3 expression have also been linked to schizophrenia and bipolar disorders, with polymorphisms in its promoter region associated with these conditions (Zhou2010Deletion).

## Interactions
PIK3C3, also known as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit type 3, is involved in various protein interactions that regulate autophagy and other cellular processes. It forms complexes with proteins such as Beclin1, UVRAG, and AMBRA1, which are crucial for autophagy regulation (Yuan2013Regulation). PIK3C3 interacts with PDPK1, where its binding is enhanced by the SUMOylation and phosphorylation of PDPK1. This interaction is essential for autophagosome biogenesis and is modulated by treatments such as rapamycin and insulin (Hu2020PDPK1). PIK3C3 also competes with UBE2I for binding to PDPK1, affecting PDPK1's SUMOylation and its role in autophagosome formation (Hu2020PDPK1).

In the context of viral infections, PIK3C3's interaction with the Avibirnavirus VP3 protein disrupts its binding with Beclin1, thereby inhibiting autophagy. VP3 binds to PIK3C3 through its CC3 domain, affecting the PIK3C3-PDPK1 interaction and activating the AKT-MTOR pathway (Zhang2019Binding). PIK3C3 also interacts with AHCYL1, which senses S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) to inhibit autophagy in an MTORC1-independent manner (Huang2021AHCYL1). These interactions highlight PIK3C3's role in modulating autophagy and cellular signaling pathways.
