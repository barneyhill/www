# LBHD1

## Overview
The LBHD1 gene encodes the protein LBH domain containing 1, which is implicated in various cellular processes, including protein degradation and signal transduction. This protein is characterized by its interaction with ubiquitin C, suggesting a role in the ubiquitin proteasome system, a critical pathway for maintaining cellular protein homeostasis (Dong2019Study). Although the specific functions and interactions of LBHD1 isoforms remain largely unexplored, the protein has been associated with cancer cell migration and invasion, particularly in bladder cancer, indicating its potential involvement in oncogenic processes (Dong2019Study). Additionally, LBHD1 is affected by GPATCH11 variants, which can lead to mis-splicing and downregulation, further linking it to conditions such as retinal dystrophy and neurological impairments (Perrault2023GPATCH11). Despite these findings, the comprehensive biological roles and clinical implications of LBHD1 require further elucidation.

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
The LBHD1 gene has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to its altered expression and potential mutations. Partial deletions of the LBHD1 gene have been associated with intellectual disabilities and limb abnormalities, while partial duplications are linked to behavioral issues, developmental delays, and various physical anomalies (Dong2019Study). In the context of cancer, LBHD1 expression has been studied in bladder cancer, where it was found to be highly expressed in certain bladder cancer cell lines. This elevated expression correlates with increased cell migration and invasion, suggesting a role in cancer progression. However, LBHD1 expression does not significantly affect cell proliferation (Dong2019Study).

Additionally, LBHD1 is one of the genes affected by GPATCH11 variants, which cause mis-splicing and downregulation, potentially leading to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. This mis-splicing is associated with retinal dystrophy and neurological impairments, although the direct clinical significance of LBHD1 mutations in these conditions remains unclear (Perrault2023GPATCH11). Despite these associations, the full clinical implications of LBHD1 gene mutations and their role in human diseases require further investigation to be fully understood.

## Interactions
LBHD1 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, including potential interactions with other proteins. The study by Chunhui Dong et al. suggests that LBHD1 interacts with ubiquitin C in its native state, as detected by an Affinity Capture-MS assay. This interaction implies a role for LBHD1 in the ubiquitin proteasome system, which is crucial for protein degradation and signal transduction (Dong2019Study). However, the specific functions of LBHD1 isoforms and their differences in interactions remain unknown. The study does not provide detailed information on other protein or nucleic acid interactions involving LBHD1, nor does it explore the molecular interactions of the LBHD1 protein itself in depth (Dong2019Study). 

While the research highlights LBHD1's potential involvement in bladder cancer cell migration and invasion, it does not directly address other protein interactions beyond the noted interaction with ubiquitin C. The study's findings suggest that LBHD1 may play a role in cancer cell behavior, but further research is needed to elucidate its broader interaction network and functional implications in cellular mechanisms.
