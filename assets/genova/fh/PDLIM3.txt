# PDLIM3

## Overview
PDLIM3 is a gene that encodes the protein PDZ and LIM domain 3, also known as alpha-actinin-associated LIM protein 3. This protein is a member of the PDLIM family and is characterized by the presence of a PDZ domain and a LIM domain, which facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions, particularly within muscle tissues. The PDZ domain of PDZ and LIM domain 3 is involved in binding to the C-terminus of other proteins, such as α-actinin, playing a crucial role in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and maintaining muscle integrity. The LIM domain, a zinc-binding motif, contributes to the protein's structural stability. PDLIM3 is predominantly expressed in the heart and skeletal muscles, where it is essential for muscle function and development. The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms with tissue-specific expression patterns, which are implicated in various muscular and cardiovascular disorders (Healy2021Proteomic; Xue2014Molecular; Ohsawa2011Alternative).

## Structure
PDLIM3, also known as actinin-associated LIM protein 3, is characterized by the presence of an N-terminal PDZ domain and a C-terminal LIM domain. These domains are crucial for its role in protein-protein interactions, particularly in muscle tissues where it is predominantly expressed (Healy2021Proteomic; Xue2014Molecular). The PDZ domain typically binds to the C-terminus of other proteins, facilitating interactions with actin and α-actinin, which are essential for cytoskeletal organization (Healy2021Proteomic). The LIM domain, a zinc-binding motif, contributes to the structural stability of the protein.

PDLIM3 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms, including PDLIM3a, PDLIM3b, and PDLIM3c. These isoforms exhibit tissue-specific expression patterns, with PDLIM3b being predominantly expressed in fetal skeletal muscles and DM1 skeletal muscles, while PDLIM3a and PDLIM3c are more prevalent in adult skeletal muscles and the heart (Ohsawa2011Alternative). In pigs, a spliced variant named PDLIM3-4 has been identified, encoding a 200-amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 21.3 kDa and a theoretical isoelectric point of 7.26 (Xue2014Molecular). The structural prediction for PDLIM3-4 includes a PDZ domain and a segment of low compositional complexity.

## Function
PDLIM3, also known as alpha-actinin-associated LIM protein 3, plays a crucial role in muscle function by maintaining the structural integrity of muscle tissues. It is predominantly expressed in the heart and skeletal muscles, where it binds to alpha-actinin 2 at the Z-discs of muscle fibers through its PDZ domain. This interaction is essential for force transmission and muscle integrity, highlighting PDLIM3's role in organizing the actin cytoskeleton and ensuring proper muscle function (Xia1997Actininassociated; Ohsawa2011Alternative).

The PDLIM3 protein is involved in the splicing process that produces different isoforms, which are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. In healthy human cells, the splicing of PDLIM3 is regulated in a muscle-specific manner, with isoforms PDLIM3a and PDLIM3c predominantly expressed in muscle tissues such as the heart and skeletal muscles (Ohsawa2011Alternative). The ZASP-like motif, encoded by exon 6, is necessary for the interaction with alpha-actinin, suggesting that PDLIM3 is vital for maintaining muscle structure (Ohsawa2011Alternative).

PDLIM3 is also implicated in muscle development, as its splicing pattern changes during development, particularly in skeletal muscles. It may regulate muscle differentiation, as its disruption affects the expression of myogenin and MyoD, which are key factors in muscle development (Ohsawa2011Alternative).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PDLIM3 gene have been associated with several cardiovascular and muscular disorders. A specific mutation, a 2-bp insertion in exon 2 of PDLIM3, has been linked to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). This mutation results in a frameshift and premature stop codon, leading to a truncated protein that is likely degraded, contributing to the disease phenotype in affected individuals (Arola2007Mutations). 

PDLIM3 is also implicated in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), where its splicing is aberrant, resembling fetal muscle patterns. This abnormal splicing may affect the protein's interaction with α-actinin 2, potentially contributing to muscle symptoms in DM1 patients (Ohsawa2011Alternative).

Additionally, loss-of-function variants in PDLIM3 have been associated with early-onset atrial fibrillation (AF). These variants are enriched in individuals with AF compared to controls, suggesting a role in the development of atrial cardiomyopathy (Vad2020LossofFunction). 

Polymorphisms in PDLIM3 have also been linked to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, indicating a genetic predisposition to this condition (Wang2019Novel).

## Interactions
PDLIM3, also known as ALP, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in muscle development and maintenance. PDLIM3 interacts with α-actinin, a muscle-specific cytoskeletal protein, through its PDZ domain, which binds specifically to the spectrin-like repeat region of α-actinin-2. This interaction is unique to PDLIM3, as other PDZ domains do not interact with α-actinin-2 (Xia1997Actininassociated). The ZM motif within PDLIM3 is also essential for its interaction with the rod region of α-actinin, facilitating its localization to the Z-lines in muscle cells (Klaavuniemi2004The).

PDLIM3 is part of the PDLIM protein family, which interacts with actin and α-actinin proteins to organize the actin cytoskeleton. These interactions are mediated by the disordered regions of PDLIM3, which engage with the spectrin repeats of α-actinin proteins, acting as cross-linkers of the actin cytoskeleton (healy2023pdlim). PDLIM3 also interacts with sorting nexin SNX17, with binding affinities ranging from 10 to 40 μM, indicating a selective interaction within the PDLIM family (Healy2021Proteomic). These interactions highlight PDLIM3's role in maintaining muscle cell stability and influencing muscle structure and signaling pathways.
