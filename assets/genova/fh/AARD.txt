# AARD

## Overview
The AARD gene encodes the alanine and arginine rich domain containing protein, which is characterized by its significant interaction with the androgen receptor (AR) in mouse Sertoli cells. This protein is implicated in the regulation of gene expression mediated by AR, a critical factor in male reproductive biology. The AARD protein is not classified as a kinase, receptor, or transmembrane protein, but rather as a regulatory protein that plays a role in the modulation of gene expression through its interaction with AR. The expression of AARD is directly influenced by AR, as evidenced by the presence of an androgen response element (ARE) in its promoter region, which facilitates AR binding and subsequent transcriptional regulation. This interaction is crucial for the upregulation of AARD in response to testosterone, highlighting its potential role in spermatogenesis and male fertility (Geng2016Alanine).

## Interactions
The alanine and arginine rich domain containing protein (AARD) is involved in interactions with the androgen receptor (AR) in mouse Sertoli cells. AARD expression is directly regulated by AR, as demonstrated by various assays including luciferase reporter assays, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. These studies identified a potential androgen response element (ARE) in the Aard promoter, which is crucial for AR binding (Geng2016Alanine). The EMSA confirmed the binding of AR to the Aard promoter, and the ChIP assay further validated this interaction in vivo (Geng2016Alanine).

The interaction between AARD and AR is significant for the regulation of AARD expression, as shown by the upregulation of AARD in primary Sertoli cells treated with testosterone, which is mediated via AR. This upregulation was observed at both mRNA and protein levels when AR was overexpressed, while AARD expression was downregulated with AR knockdown (Geng2016Alanine). These findings suggest that AARD is a novel target of AR, with its expression regulated by the direct binding of AR to its promoter, potentially influencing spermatogenesis and male fertility (Geng2016Alanine).
