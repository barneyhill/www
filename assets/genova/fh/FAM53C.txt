# FAM53C

## Overview
FAM53C is a gene that encodes a protein known as "family with sequence similarity 53 member C," which is involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of kinase activity. The FAM53C protein is characterized as a cytosolic-anchoring inhibitory binding protein that interacts with the kinase DYRK1A, playing a crucial role in modulating its activity and intracellular distribution. This interaction is significant in neurodevelopmental contexts and conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, where the regulation of DYRK1A's activity is critical (Miyata2023Identification). The protein is expressed in multiple human tissues, with notable expression in the brain and bone marrow, and is involved in forming a tri-protein complex with DYRK1A and DCAF7/WDR68, further influencing cellular signaling pathways (Miyata2023Identification). FAM53C's role in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric conditions, such as Down syndrome and autism spectrum disorders, underscores its clinical significance (Viard2022Chr21).

## Structure
The FAM53C protein is composed of 392 amino acids and is characterized by a low-complexity sequence, with a high content of serine (16%), proline (14%), leucine (10%), and arginine (9%), which together make up half of the protein's composition (Miyata2023Identification). It is a substantially disordered protein, primarily consisting of coil structures with intrinsically disordered regions throughout, except for short helices at the N- and C-terminal edges and several possible tiny beta-strands (Miyata2023Identification). Structural predictions using AlphaFold2 suggest that only a limited number of small fragments of FAM53C can be determined with high confidence, and the protein does not show obvious similarity with known protein folds (Miyata2023Identification).

FAM53C interacts with the kinase DYRK1A and DCAF7/WDR68, forming a tri-protein complex that suppresses DYRK1A's kinase activity (Miyata2023Identification). This interaction is crucial for regulating DYRK1A's intracellular distribution and preventing it from phosphorylating nuclear substrates (Miyata2023Identification). The protein also undergoes phosphorylation at nine serine residues, with some sites being sensitive to specific kinase inhibitors (Miyata2023Identification). There are three transcription variants for human FAM53C, with isoform 1 consisting of 392 amino acids (Miyata2023Identification).

## Function
The FAM53C gene encodes a protein that functions as a cytosolic-anchoring inhibitory binding protein for the kinase DYRK1A. In healthy human cells, FAM53C plays a crucial role in regulating the intracellular distribution and activity of DYRK1A by binding to its catalytic domain. This interaction inhibits DYRK1A's autophosphorylation and kinase activity, particularly towards substrates like MAPT/Tau, which is relevant to neurodevelopmental processes and conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (Miyata2023Identification).

FAM53C's binding to DYRK1A induces its retention in the cytoplasm, preventing its nuclear localization and subsequent phosphorylation of nuclear substrates. This cytoplasmic anchoring is essential for maintaining DYRK1A in an inactive state, thereby regulating gene expression and cellular functions under normal conditions (Miyata2023Identification). FAM53C also forms a tri-protein complex with DYRK1A and DCAF7/WDR68, further influencing DYRK1A's localization and activity (Miyata2023Identification).

The protein is expressed in various human tissues, particularly in the brain and bone marrow, with low tissue specificity. Knock-out studies in mice suggest that FAM53C may play a role in neurodevelopment and neurological function, as indicated by behavioral changes in these models (Miyata2023Identification).

## Clinical Significance
FAM53C has been implicated in various neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric conditions due to its interaction with the kinase DYRK1A. This interaction is significant in the context of Down syndrome, where DYRK1A is overexpressed, leading to various pathological phenotypes. FAM53C acts as a cytosolic-anchoring inhibitory binding protein, suppressing DYRK1A's kinase activity and preventing it from phosphorylating substrates like MAPT/Tau, which is linked to Alzheimer's disease (Miyata2023Identification). Disruptions in the balance between DYRK1A and FAM53C levels could contribute to disease states, although specific diseases directly associated with mutations or alterations in FAM53C itself are not detailed (Miyata2023Identification).

In the context of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), an SNP within the FAM53C-KDM4 locus has been associated with ASDs, suggesting a potential link between FAM53C and certain behavioral and cognitive conditions. Fam53c-knockout mouse models exhibit abnormal behavior, including poor exploration of new environments and low levels of thigmotaxis, indicating an altered emotional response (Viard2022Chr21). These findings suggest that FAM53C may play a role in neurodevelopmental disorders, although direct evidence of diseases caused by FAM53C mutations is limited.

## Interactions
FAM53C is a protein that interacts with several other proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It is identified as a cytosolic-anchoring inhibitory binding protein of the kinase DYRK1A. FAM53C binds specifically to the catalytic domain of DYRK1A, inhibiting its autophosphorylation and kinase activity towards substrates such as MAPT/Tau, which is linked to Alzheimer's disease (Miyata2023Identification). This interaction also results in the cytoplasmic retention of DYRK1A, preventing it from phosphorylating nuclear substrates and affecting its intracellular localization (Miyata2023Identification).

FAM53C forms a tri-protein complex with DYRK1A and DCAF7/WDR68, where DYRK1A acts as a scaffold facilitating the association between FAM53C and DCAF7/WDR68 (Miyata2023Identification). Although FAM53C does not directly bind to DCAF7/WDR68, the presence of DYRK1A enables this interaction (Miyata2023Identification).

FAM53C also interacts with DYRK1B, a kinase closely related to DYRK1A, in a manner independent of the molecular chaperones Hsp90 and Cdc37 (Miyata2023Identification). Additionally, FAM53C interacts with several 14-3-3 proteins, which are central to cellular signaling networks, suggesting its involvement in various 14-3-3 dependent signaling pathways (Miyata2023Identification).
