# ARHGEF11

## Overview
ARHGEF11 is a gene that encodes the protein Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 11, which is a member of the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) family. This protein plays a pivotal role in cellular processes by regulating the activation of RhoA, a small GTPase involved in actin cytoskeleton dynamics. As a GEF, ARHGEF11 facilitates the exchange of GDP for GTP on RhoA, thereby activating it. The protein is integral to maintaining epithelial tight junction integrity and is involved in processes such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell migration. ARHGEF11 interacts with various proteins, including ZO-1 and components of the Rho-ROCK signaling pathway, to mediate its effects on the cytoskeleton and cell motility (Lee2018Esrp1Regulated; Itoh2013ARHGEF11; Nanda2023Rho).

## Function
ARHGEF11, also known as Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 11, plays a crucial role in maintaining epithelial tight junction (TJ) integrity by regulating RhoA activation and myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation. This protein acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for RhoA, a small GTPase involved in actin cytoskeleton dynamics, which is essential for the assembly and maintenance of TJs and the perijunctional actomyosin ring (PJAR) (Lee2018Esrp1Regulated; Itoh2013ARHGEF11). ARHGEF11 interacts with the scaffold protein ZO-1 at TJs, facilitating the localization and function of RhoA, which leads to the phosphorylation of MLC and the formation of a contractile actomyosin ring necessary for TJ integrity (Lee2018Esrp1Regulated).

The protein is also involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), where its mesenchymal isoform can promote cell migration and invasion by interacting with PAK4, inhibiting RhoA activation, and reducing MLC phosphorylation, which disrupts TJs (Lee2018Esrp1Regulated). In addition, ARHGEF11 is implicated in coordinating cell protrusion-retraction cycles through its interaction with Rac and Rho GTPases, which are crucial for cell migration and morphodynamics (Nanda2023Rho; Nanda2023Crosstalk).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ARHGEF11 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions, particularly type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and insulin resistance. The R1467H variant in ARHGEF11 is associated with an increased risk of T2DM and impaired glucose tolerance in various populations, including German Caucasians and Pima Indians. This variant is thought to influence insulin signaling, contributing to the pathophysiology of T2DM (Ma2007Variants; Böttcher2008R1467H). In a Chinese population, the R1467H polymorphism was associated with higher fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels, indicating a potential link to insulin resistance (Liu2011Association).

ARHGEF11 is also implicated in kidney injury, particularly in the context of hypertension. Studies using the Dahl salt-sensitive rat model have shown that genetic variants in ARHGEF11 can modulate renal protection through the Rho-ROCK signaling pathway, which is involved in actin cytoskeletal organization and cell adhesion. These findings suggest that ARHGEF11 may play a role in the development of chronic kidney disease (Williams2012Genetic; Johnson2020Loss).

Epigenetic alterations in ARHGEF11, such as DNA methylation changes, have been observed in macrosomic infants exposed to intrauterine hyperglycemia, potentially linking the gene to obesity and abnormal glucose metabolism (Yan2019Epigenetic).

## Interactions
ARHGEF11, also known as PDZ-RhoGEF, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It directly interacts with the C-terminal region of the ZO-1 protein, a component of tight junctions in epithelial cells. This interaction is essential for the localization of ARHGEF11 at tight junctions, although ZO-1's localization is not dependent on ARHGEF11 (Itoh2013ARHGEF11). ARHGEF11 also plays a role in the Rho-ROCK signaling pathway, where it acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) specific for RhoA, facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP to activate RhoA. This activation is crucial for regulating actin cytoskeletal organization and cell motility (Jia2015Allelic).

ARHGEF11 is recruited to the plasma membrane following Rac1 activation, where it interacts with F-actin, a component of the cytoskeleton. This recruitment is not dependent on its PH domain but rather on its ability to bind F-actin, facilitating its role in Rac/Rho activity crosstalk (Nanda2023Rho). Additionally, ARHGEF11 interacts with the Gα 12/13 subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins through its RGS domain, linking G protein-coupled signaling to Rho at tight junctions (Itoh2013ARHGEF11).
