# DNAJC3

## Overview
DNAJC3 is a gene that encodes the DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member C3, a co-chaperone protein primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of human cells. This protein, also known as p58 IPK, plays a pivotal role in maintaining protein homeostasis by assisting in the proper folding of newly synthesized proteins and mitigating ER stress through its interaction with BiP (GRP78, HSPA5) (Jennings2021Intracellular). DNAJC3 is involved in regulating the unfolded protein response (UPR) and is crucial for maintaining normal protein synthesis and ER homeostasis during cellular stress (Welters2024Congenital). Beyond its role in protein folding, DNAJC3 is implicated in lipid metabolism, cholesterol homeostasis, and calcium regulation, linking ER stress to broader cellular functions such as mitochondrial integrity and insulin secretion (Jennings2021Intracellular; Welters2024Congenital). Mutations in the DNAJC3 gene are associated with various multisystem disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases and diabetes mellitus, highlighting its clinical significance (Alwatban2021Case; Welters2024Congenital).

## Structure
The DNAJC3 protein, also known as dnaJ homolog subfamily c member 3, consists of 504 amino acids and features an N-terminal ER-targeting tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain. This domain contains nine TPR motifs, which are organized into three TPR subdomains. The crystal structure of DNAJC3 highlights these motifs and subdomains, with a particular focus on the histidine residue at position 238 (H238) located in TPR6 of subdomain II. This residue is conserved across multiple species, including humans, and is involved in a polar contact with N269 of TPR7 in subdomain III. A mutation substituting H238 with 238N disrupts this contact, forming a new hydrogen bond with Y304, located between TPR7 and TPR8 of subdomain III, which affects protein stability (Kulanuwat2018DNAJC3).

DNAJC3 is a co-chaperone of BiP and plays a role in protein folding within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It interacts with misfolded proteins through its N-terminus and facilitates their refolding via ATP-dependent interactions with BiP. DNAJC3 also downregulates the unfolded protein response by interacting with the cytoplasmic domain of PERK, influencing protein synthesis and ER homeostasis (Jennings2021Intracellular). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications like phosphorylation and has splice variant isoforms. However, specific details on its primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures are not provided in the available context.

## Function
DNAJC3, also known as p58 IPK, is a co-chaperone protein that plays a critical role in maintaining protein homeostasis within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of healthy human cells. It functions by transiently binding to newly synthesized proteins in the ER to prevent misfolding and assists in the refolding of misfolded proteins through an ATP-dependent interaction with BiP (GRP78, HSPA5) (Jennings2021Intracellular). DNAJC3 is involved in the regulation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) by downregulating the signaling of the UPR effector PERK, which helps maintain normal protein synthesis and ER homeostasis during cellular stress (Jennings2021Intracellular; Welters2024Congenital).

In addition to its role in protein folding, DNAJC3 is implicated in lipid metabolism and cholesterol homeostasis. Its loss leads to lipid dysregulation, including cholesterol accumulation, which can disturb ER membrane structure and activate ER stress (Jennings2021Intracellular). DNAJC3 also plays a role in maintaining mitochondrial function and architecture, linking ER stress to mitochondrial dysfunction (Jennings2021Intracellular). Furthermore, DNAJC3 is involved in regulating calcium homeostasis within the ER, which is crucial for insulin secretion and cellular signaling (Welters2024Congenital).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DNAJC3 gene are associated with a range of multisystem disorders. Homozygous mutations in DNAJC3 have been linked to nonimmune juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus, neurodegeneration, sensorineural hearing loss, short stature, and hypothyroidism (Alwatban2021Case). These mutations can lead to conditions such as maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) and are often accompanied by pancreatic atrophy (Alwatban2021Case). DNAJC3 mutations are also associated with congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI), characterized by hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, which can progress to diabetes mellitus in adolescence (Welters2024Congenital).

The gene plays a crucial role in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, and its deficiency can lead to increased ER stress and apoptosis, particularly affecting pancreatic beta cells and neurons (Jennings2021Intracellular; Welters2024Congenital). This disruption in ER homeostasis is linked to various symptoms, including neurodegeneration with ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, cognitive impairment, and retinal dystrophy (Welters2024Congenital). DNAJC3 mutations have also been implicated in conditions resembling Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome, Wolfram syndrome, and Wollcot-Rallison syndrome, which involve ER stress and lipid metabolism dysregulation (Jennings2021Intracellular).

## Interactions
DNAJC3, also known as p58 IPK, is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident co-chaperone that interacts with a variety of proteins to maintain cellular homeostasis. It primarily functions by transiently binding to newly synthesized proteins in the ER to prevent misfolding. The N-terminus of DNAJC3 can directly bind to hydrophobic regions of misfolded proteins, facilitating their refolding through interaction with BiP (GRP78, HSPA5) in an ATP-dependent manner via its J-domain (Jennings2021Intracellular).

DNAJC3 also plays a role in modulating the unfolded protein response (UPR) by interacting with the cytoplasmic domain of the UPR effector protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK). This interaction inhibits PERK dimerization, which is crucial for reducing protein synthesis through the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α). By inhibiting PERK dimerization, DNAJC3 helps increase protein synthesis and restore ER homeostasis during prolonged UPR signaling (Jennings2021Intracellular).

Mutations in DNAJC3 have been linked to disruptions in these interactions, leading to cellular stress and contributing to conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases and diabetes mellitus (Jennings2021Intracellular).
