# CCN3

## Overview
CCN3, also known as NOV, is a gene that encodes the protein cellular communication network factor 3, a member of the CCN family of matricellular proteins. This protein is characterized by its multimodular structure, which includes domains such as the insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP) domain, von Willebrand factor type C (VWC) domain, thrombospondin type 1 (TSP1) domain, and a cysteine knot (CT) domain. These domains facilitate its involvement in a variety of cellular processes, including cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, and differentiation. CCN3 is particularly noted for its role in regulating cell signaling pathways such as Notch and Bone Morphogenic Protein (BMP), which are crucial for stem cell maintenance and differentiation (Lazar2007Domainspecific; McCallum2009CCN3). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as integrins and fibulin-1C, underscore its function in modulating the extracellular matrix and influencing cellular dynamics (Lombet2003CCN3). CCN3's expression and activity have significant implications in various pathological conditions, including cancer and fibrotic diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Dankner2019CCN3Nephroblastoma; Riser2015Balanced).

## Structure
The CCN3 protein, also known as NOV, is a member of the CCN family characterized by a multimodular structure. It consists of four conserved domains: an insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP) domain, a von Willebrand factor type C (VWC) domain, a thrombospondin type 1 (TSP1) domain, and a cysteine knot (CT) domain (Krupska2015Eyeing; Lazar2007Domainspecific). The IGFBP domain shares partial identity with insulin-like growth factor binding proteins, although its ability to bind IGF is debated (Planque2003A). The VWC domain, encoded by exon 3, includes a Von Willebrand Factor Type C repeat and is conserved among CCN proteins, except for CCN6 (Planque2003A).

The full-length CCN3 protein is approximately 54 kDa, while truncated forms, such as a 28 kDa version lacking the signal peptide and module I, have been identified. These truncated forms can result from proteolytic cleavage and may have distinct biological activities, including roles in transcription regulation and tumorigenesis (Planque2003A; Lazar2007Domainspecific). The secondary structure of CCN3 includes β-sheets specific to certain CCN proteins, and its tertiary structure involves interactions that may affect its function (Planque2003A). The quaternary structure could involve oligomerization, influenced by the VWC module (Planque2003A).

## Function
CCN3, also known as NOV, is a member of the CCN family of growth regulators and plays a significant role in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, CCN3 is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, differentiation, apoptosis, growth arrest, and extracellular matrix production. It acts through core stem cell signaling pathways, including Notch and Bone Morphogenic Protein (BMP), to modulate self-renewal and maturation of various cell lineages such as hematopoietic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic (McCallum2009CCN3).

CCN3 is crucial for the spatial localization and homeostasis of melanocytes in human skin. It regulates melanocyte adhesion to the basement membrane through the DDR1 adhesion receptor for collagen type IV, maintaining normal localization and inhibiting proliferation (FukunagaKalabis2006CCN3). In the hematopoietic compartment, CCN3 is expressed at various stages of myeloid lineage commitment and is involved in balancing self-renewal and differentiation, often in conjunction with Notch signaling (McCallum2009CCN3).

In the kidney, CCN3 acts as an endogenous inhibitor of mesangial cell growth and modulates platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced mitogenesis, playing a role in controlling cell proliferation in response to PDGF signaling (van2008CCN3).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CCN3 gene have been implicated in various cancers and other diseases. In prostate cancer, high levels of CCN3 expression are associated with aggressive disease characteristics, including increased risk of biochemical relapse and bone metastasis. CCN3 promotes prostate cancer metastasis by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition, enhancing cancer cell motility, and promoting osteoclastogenesis, which leads to bone matrix resorption (Dankner2019CCN3Nephroblastoma). In breast cancer, CCN3 expression is linked to bone metastases, where it promotes osteoclast differentiation, contributing to osteolytic lesions (Ouellet2012CCN3).

CCN3 also plays a role in musculoskeletal tumors, where its overexpression is associated with lung and/or bone metastases (LI2015Emerging). In glioma cells, CCN3 exhibits an antiproliferative effect, reducing tumor growth and interfering with the cell cycle (Bleau2007Antiproliferative). In chronic myeloid leukemia, CCN3 restores cell growth regulatory properties and sensitizes cells to apoptosis (LI2015Emerging).

In fibrotic diseases, CCN3 acts as an antagonist to pro-fibrotic changes. Its expression is reduced in conditions like nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, suggesting a protective role against fibrosis (Riser2015Balanced). These findings highlight the diverse roles of CCN3 in disease progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
CCN3, also known as NOV, is a matricellular protein that engages in various physical interactions with other proteins, influencing numerous cellular processes. It interacts with fibulin-1C, a calcium-binding extracellular matrix glycoprotein, through its C-terminal part, suggesting a role in signaling pathways involving the extracellular matrix and cytoskeleton proteins (Lombet2003CCN3). CCN3 also interacts with integrins, specifically αVβ3 and α5β1, which are cell surface receptors involved in cell adhesion and migration (Lombet2003CCN3). 

The protein interacts with S100A4, a member of the S100 protein family, which modulates calcium signals and is implicated in tumor progression and metastasis (Lombet2003CCN3). CCN3's interaction with Notch1, a transmembrane receptor involved in embryonic development, is Ca2+-independent (Lombet2003CCN3). 

In the nucleus, CCN3 interacts with nuclear proteins involved in RNA processing and chromatin remodeling, indicating its role as a transcription regulator (Perbal2006New). It also interacts with IL33, a cytokine, suggesting involvement in inflammatory processes (Perbal2006New). These interactions highlight CCN3's involvement in diverse signaling pathways, balancing anti- and pro-proliferative activities.
