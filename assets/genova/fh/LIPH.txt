# LIPH

## Overview
The LIPH gene encodes the enzyme lipase H, a membrane-bound phospholipase that plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism by hydrolyzing phosphatidic acid to produce 2-acyl lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and fatty acids. Lipase H is integral to various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, migration, and survival, and is particularly significant in the maturation and proliferation of hair follicle cells, thereby contributing to normal hair growth and structure (Khan2023In; Holmes2012Comparative). The enzyme is expressed in multiple tissues, such as the intestine, lung, pancreas, and hair follicles, indicating its involvement in broader biological functions beyond hair growth (Holmes2012Comparative). Mutations in the LIPH gene are linked to conditions like autosomal recessive hypotrichosis and woolly hair, characterized by abnormal hair texture and growth (Shinkuma2010PrevalentLIPHfounder; Khan2023In).

## Structure
The LIPH protein, encoded by the LIPH gene, is a membrane-bound phospholipase involved in lipid metabolism. Its primary structure consists of 451 amino acids in humans, with key features including an N-terminal signal peptide and a catalytic triad composed of Ser 154, Asp 178, and His 248, which form a charge relay network essential for substrate hydrolysis (Holmes2012Comparative). The secondary structure of LIPH includes alpha helices and beta sheets, with specific regions such as residues 147-167 in mouse LIPH identified as likely binding regions for phospholipid substrates (Holmes2012Comparative).

The tertiary structure of LIPH is characterized by a smaller 'lid' region that may act as a surface loop covering the catalytic triad, similar to other lipase families (Holmes2012Comparative). The protein also contains several disulfide bond-forming residues and multiple predicted N-glycosylation sites, which may contribute to its stability and catalytic efficiency (Holmes2012Comparative). Mutations in LIPH, such as p.W108R and p.M1T, can alter its secondary and tertiary structures, affecting the number of alpha helices and beta sheets and leading to functional changes (Ammara2013In). The LIPH protein does not have a quaternary structure as it functions as a single polypeptide chain.

## Function
The LIPH gene encodes the enzyme lipase H, which is a membrane-bound phospholipase involved in the hydrolysis of phosphatidic acid to produce 2-acyl lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and fatty acids. LPA is a bioactive lipid mediator that plays a critical role in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, migration, and survival (Khan2023In; Holmes2012Comparative). In healthy human cells, lipase H is essential for the maturation and proliferation of hair follicle cells, contributing to normal hair growth and structure (Khan2023In). The enzyme is particularly active in hair follicles, where it facilitates LPA signaling through the LPA receptor P2Y5, which is crucial for hair growth and maintenance (Shinkuma2010PrevalentLIPHfounder; Holmes2012Comparative).

Lipase H is expressed in various tissues, including the intestine, lung, pancreas, prostate, testis, ovary, platelets, and hair follicle cells, indicating its involvement in broader biological functions beyond hair growth (Holmes2012Comparative). The enzyme's activity is vital for maintaining the structural integrity and development of hair follicles, and its dysfunction can lead to conditions such as autosomal recessive hypotrichosis, characterized by sparse hair (Shinkuma2010PrevalentLIPHfounder; Khan2023In).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LIPH gene are associated with autosomal recessive woolly hair (ARWH) and hypotrichosis, conditions characterized by abnormal hair texture and growth. In the Japanese population, two prevalent missense mutations, c.736T>A (p.Cys246Ser) and c.742C>A (p.His248Asn), are identified as founder mutations for ARWH. The c.736T>A mutation is linked to mild hypotrichosis and woolly hair, while the c.742C>A mutation is associated with severe baldness (Tanahashi2014Highly; Shinkuma2010PrevalentLIPHfounder). These mutations affect critical residues in the enzyme PA-PLA1α, impairing its activity and reducing its ability to hydrolyze free fatty acids from phosphatidic acid (Shinkuma2010PrevalentLIPHfounder).

The LIPH gene mutations have been reported in various populations, including Russian, Pakistani, Jewish, Arab-Muslim, Italian, Indian, Japanese, Lebanese, and Chinese, indicating a broad geographical distribution (Akiyama2021Isolated). In some populations, such as the Mari and Chuvash, a deletion of exon 4 in the LIPH gene has been identified, which eliminates a highly conserved domain crucial for its function (Kazantseva2006Human). These genetic alterations disrupt normal hair follicle development and lipid processing, leading to the clinical manifestations of ARWH and hypotrichosis.

## Interactions
LIPH (lipase H) is involved in several interactions with other proteins that influence cellular processes. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), LIPH interacts with the transcription factors YAP1 and HIF1A. LIPH overexpression stabilizes YAP1, reducing its proteasomal degradation and promoting its nuclear localization, which enhances glycolysis and tumor viability. This interaction is mediated through the LIPH-LPA-LPAR axis, which inhibits LATS1/2 phosphorylation, crucial for YAP1's subcellular localization and function (Han2023LIPH). LIPH also interacts with ALDOA, a glycolytic enzyme, by reducing its interaction with UBE2O, thereby stabilizing ALDOA and supporting the glycolytic phenotype in PDAC cells (Han2023LIPH).

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), LIPH is associated with cancer stem-like cells and affects cellular respiration and adhesion. LIPH silencing leads to changes in adhesion markers, such as increased vimentin and FAK p397 levels, and decreased paxillin levels, indicating its role in modulating cell adhesion and migration (Zhang2020LIPH). These interactions highlight LIPH's role in cancer progression by influencing key signaling pathways and cellular behaviors.
