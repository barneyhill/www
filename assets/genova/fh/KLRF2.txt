# KLRF2

## Overview
KLRF2, or killer cell lectin-like receptor F2, is a gene that encodes a protein known as NKp65, which functions as an activating receptor primarily expressed in natural killer (NK) cells. NKp65 is categorized as a receptor and is involved in the immune response by recognizing and binding to its ligand, KACL, a C-type lectin encoded by the CLEC2A gene. This interaction is characterized by a high affinity, contributing to the receptor's role in immune surveillance and cytotoxic activity against target cells, such as cancer cells. The NKp65 receptor contains a hemITAM motif, which is crucial for signaling pathways that recruit Syk kinase, similar to other myeloid-specific C-type lectin-like receptors. Despite its significant role in immune function, the physiological expression of NKp65 outside of the NK-92 cell line remains to be fully elucidated (Vogler2011VisàVis; Bartel2013Modulation).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
The KLRF2 gene, also known as killer cell lectin-like receptor F2, plays a role in the immune response, particularly in natural killer (NK) cells. Alterations in the expression of KLRF2 have been implicated in various diseases. In the context of endometriosis, a condition characterized by the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterus, KLRF2 expression is decreased in NK cells. This reduction is associated with decreased NK cell number and cytotoxicity, suggesting a potential role in the immune dysfunction observed in endometriosis patients (Miller2019Endometrial).

In cancer, KLRF2, also referred to as NKp65, functions as a stimulatory receptor on NK cells. It recognizes the C-type lectin KACL, which is involved in the immune surveillance of cancer cells. The balance between stimulatory and inhibitory signals in NK cells is crucial for their activation and ability to target cancer cells. Alterations in KLRF2 expression or function could potentially impact the effectiveness of NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity against tumors (Voutsadakis2018Expression).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of KLRF2 in immune-related conditions, emphasizing the need for further research to understand its role in disease pathogenesis and potential therapeutic applications.

## Interactions
KLRF2, also known as NKp65, is an activating receptor that interacts with the ligand KACL, encoded by the CLEC2A gene. This interaction is characterized by a high affinity, with a dissociation constant (K_D) in the range of approximately 1-10 nM, making it one of the strongest known interactions between cell-bound receptors. The NKp65/KACL complex forms a symmetrical, butterfly-shaped assembly, where a KACL homodimer binds two NKp65 monomers in a bivalent binding mode. This interaction involves a large hydrophobic interface and numerous hydrogen bonds, contributing to its high affinity (Bartel2013Modulation).

The NKp65 receptor contains a hemITAM motif in its cytoplasmic domain, which is involved in signaling through the recruitment of Syk kinase. This signaling mechanism is similar to those found in myeloid-specific C-type lectin-like receptors such as CLEC-2 and Dectin-1 (Vogler2011VisàVis; Bartel2013Modulation). Despite its strong interaction with KACL, significant expression of NKp65 has been primarily detected in the NK-92 cell line, and its physiological expression in other cells remains to be identified (Bartel2013Modulation).
