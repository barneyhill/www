# PPP6C

## Overview
The PPP6C gene encodes the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 6 (PP6), a serine/threonine phosphatase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, DNA damage response, and immune signaling. The protein phosphatase 6 catalytic subunit (PP6C) is a key component of the PP6 holoenzyme, which functions as a heterotrimeric complex with regulatory subunits such as SAPS domain subunits and ankyrin repeat proteins. This complex is involved in the dephosphorylation of several critical substrates, including Aurora A kinase and components of the ERK and NF-κB signaling pathways, thereby modulating processes like mitotic spindle formation and immune responses (Ziembik2017Functions; Stefansson2008Protein; Zeng2010Protein). Mutations in PPP6C have been implicated in various cancers, notably melanoma, where they contribute to chromosomal instability and tumorigenesis (Hammond2013Melanomaassociated). The gene's role in both normal cellular function and disease underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target (Cho2021PPP6C).

## Structure
The PPP6C gene encodes the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 6 (PP6), a serine/threonine phosphatase involved in various cellular processes. The primary structure of PPP6C consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, with specific regions critical for its phosphatase activity. The secondary structure includes alpha helices, which are part of the SAPS domain regulatory subunits that interact with PPP6C (Guergnon2009Mapping). The tertiary structure involves the 3D folding of the protein, which is essential for its function and interaction with other subunits. 

PPP6C forms a heterotrimeric complex with regulatory subunits, including SAPS domain subunits and ankyrin repeat subunits, contributing to its quaternary structure (Stefansson2008Protein). The SAPS domain is characterized by helical repeat motifs, which are crucial for binding and regulatory functions (Guergnon2009Mapping). 

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a role in regulating PPP6C activity, particularly in the context of oncogenic signaling pathways (Cho2021PPP6C). Mutations near the catalytic cleft, such as R264C, can affect its phosphatase activity, highlighting the importance of specific residues for its function (Cho2021PPP6C).

## Function
The PPP6C gene encodes the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 6 (PP6), a serine/threonine phosphatase involved in several critical cellular processes. In healthy human cells, PPP6C plays a vital role in regulating the mitotic spindle formation by controlling the phosphorylation state of Aurora A kinase, which is essential for proper spindle assembly and chromosome alignment during mitosis (Zeng2010Protein). PPP6C acts as a T-loop phosphatase for Aurora A, ensuring balanced activity of the Aurora A-TPX2 complex, which is crucial for accurate mitotic progression (Zeng2010Protein).

PPP6C also negatively regulates the ERK signaling pathway by dephosphorylating MEK1/2, maintaining MEK in a dephosphorylated state and preventing excessive ERK activation, which is important for cell proliferation and survival (Cho2021PPP6C). In the immune system, PPP6C is involved in the NF-κB signaling pathway, where it dephosphorylates key components to limit NF-κB activation, thus playing a role in immune cell activation and cytokine production (Ziembik2017Functions). Additionally, PPP6C regulates the cGAS-STING pathway by dephosphorylating STING, preventing excessive immune responses and maintaining immune homeostasis (Ni2020PPP6C).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PPP6C gene are associated with several diseases, particularly melanoma. These mutations often lead to a loss of function, resulting in dysregulated activity of Aurora-A kinase, which causes chromosome instability and DNA damage. This instability is a significant factor in melanoma development, as it promotes tumorigenesis through mechanisms like micronucleation and chromothripsis (Hammond2013Melanomaassociated). The H114Y mutation in PPP6C is specifically noted for its role in destabilizing the PP6 holoenzyme, leading to increased proteasome-mediated turnover and reduced phosphatase activity (Hammond2013Melanomaassociated).

PPP6C mutations are also implicated in the regulation of oncogenic ERK signaling. These mutations often co-occur with BRAF and NRAS mutations in melanoma, suggesting that PPP6C acts as a tumor suppressor. The loss of PPP6C function can lead to impaired dephosphorylation of MEK, contributing to oncogenic RAS-driven tumors and increased sensitivity to MEK inhibitors (Cho2021PPP6C).

In addition to melanoma, PPP6C mutations have been linked to other cancers, such as endometrial carcinoma and breast cancer, where decreased levels of PP6 and its regulatory subunits are observed (Ohama2019The). Conversely, increased expression of PP6 is noted in pancreatic neoplasms and glioblastoma, suggesting a complex role in tumorigenesis (Ohama2019The).

## Interactions
PPP6C, the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 6, engages in various interactions with other proteins, forming part of a multisubunit enzyme complex. It associates with regulatory subunits such as SAPS domain subunits (PP6R1, PP6R2, and PP6R3) and ankyrin repeat proteins (Ankrd28, Ankrd44, and Ankrd52), which modulate its activity and specificity (Stefansson2008Protein). These interactions are crucial for the assembly and function of the PP6 holoenzyme, which acts as a heterotrimer (Stefansson2008Protein).

PPP6C also interacts with the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), playing a role in the DNA damage response. This interaction involves both the catalytic and regulatory subunits of PP6 and is regulated by phosphorylation dynamics (Douglas2010Protein). In the context of mitosis, PPP6C regulates the phosphorylation state of Aurora A kinase when bound to its activator TPX2, influencing mitotic spindle formation and progression (Zeng2010Protein).

In viral contexts, PPP6C interacts with the influenza A virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex, affecting viral replication and transcription. This interaction involves both the catalytic and regulatory subunits of PP6, suggesting a role in modulating the phosphorylation of viral proteins (York2014Interactome).
