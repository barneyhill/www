# POTEE

## Overview
POTEE is a gene that encodes the protein POTE ankyrin domain family member E, which is part of the POTE gene family characterized by ankyrin repeat domains and coiled-coil regions. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell signaling and structural organization, and is primarily located in the cell nucleus where it may function as a transcription factor or interact with other proteins to regulate gene expression (Shen2019POTEE; Vekariya2019Identification). The structural features of the protein, such as ankyrin repeats and spectrin-like helices, suggest its role in protein-protein interactions and maintaining cellular integrity (Xu2020POTEE). POTEE is implicated in several signaling pathways, including the SPHK1/p65 and Rac1/Cdc42 pathways, which are crucial for cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis regulation (Shen2019POTEE; Xu2020POTEE). Its involvement in these pathways highlights its potential role in normal cellular function and development, as well as its significance in various cancers, where it is often overexpressed and associated with poor clinical outcomes (Shen2019POTEE; Barger2018Expression).

## Structure
POTEE is a member of the POTE anchoring protein family, located on human chromosome 2q21.1. The protein structure of POTEE includes three distinct regions: N-terminal cysteine-rich domains, seven ankyrin repeats, and C-terminal spectrin-like helices. These structural features suggest that POTEE is involved in protein-protein interactions and may play a role in signaling pathways (Xu2020POTEE). The ankyrin repeats are known to be protein recognition modules that mediate interactions between proteins, which are crucial for various cellular functions. The spectrin-like helices are part of the cytoskeletal structure, indicating a potential role in maintaining cell shape and integrity (Xu2020POTEE).

POTEE also contains a full-length LIR sequence and a β-actin retrogene insertion, which is in-frame, resulting in an actin module in the protein (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). The POTE gene family, including POTEE, is characterized by ankyrin repeat domains and coiled-coil regions, which contribute to protein-protein interactions. The primary structure includes conserved sequences typical of the POTE family, and post-translational modifications may include phosphorylation. Splice variants can result in different isoforms with potentially distinct functions (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary).

## Function
POTEE, a member of the POTE ankyrin domain family, is involved in various cellular processes, including cell signaling and structural organization. In healthy human cells, POTEE is primarily located in the cell nucleus, where it may function as a transcription factor or interact with other proteins to regulate gene expression (Shen2019POTEE). The protein contains ankyrin repeats and spectrin motifs, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, suggesting a role in maintaining cellular structural integrity and signaling pathways (Vekariya2019Identification).

POTEE is implicated in the regulation of the SPHK1/p65 signaling pathway, where it influences the activation of p65, a component of the NF-κB signaling pathway. This interaction suggests that POTEE may play a role in modulating inflammatory responses and cell survival mechanisms (Shen2019POTEE). Additionally, POTEE is involved in the activation of the Rac1/Cdc42 pathway, which is crucial for cell movement and growth, indicating its role in cytoskeletal organization and cellular motility (Xu2020POTEE).

The protein's involvement in these pathways highlights its potential role in normal cellular function and development, contributing to processes such as cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis regulation (Vekariya2019Identification).

## Clinical Significance
POTEE, a member of the POTE ankyrin domain family, has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In colorectal cancer (CRC), POTEE is significantly upregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This overexpression is associated with poor clinical outcomes, including lower overall survival rates, increased lymph node metastasis, and higher clinical stages. Mechanistically, POTEE promotes CRC development by enhancing cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and inhibiting apoptosis through the SPHK1/p65 signaling pathway (Shen2019POTEE).

In ovarian cancer, particularly epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) and high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC), POTEE is overexpressed and linked to advanced disease stages and reduced overall survival. Its expression is influenced by epigenetic alterations, suggesting a role in oncogenesis (Sharma2019Epigenetic; Barger2018Expression).

POTEE is also overexpressed in breast cancer, where it is identified as a tumor-associated antigen, making it a potential target for immunotherapy (CINE2014Identification). In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), elevated serum levels of POTEE correlate with advanced cancer stages and poorer progression-free survival, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Wang2015Serum).

## Interactions
POTEE, a member of the POTE gene family, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that play significant roles in various cellular processes. In colorectal cancer, POTEE interacts with SPHK1, a key enzyme in the sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signaling pathway. This interaction is crucial for the activation of the NF-κB pathway, which promotes cancer cell proliferation (Shen2019POTEE).

In the context of liver cancer, POTEE acts as a co-factor for NMT1, facilitating N-myristoylation, a post-translational modification process. This interaction is essential for the regulation of ubiquitination of target proteins, influencing liver tumorigenesis (Zhu2021NMyristoylation).

POTEE also interacts with the HIV-1 Nef protein, activating the mTORC2 signaling pathway. This interaction is significant in modulating macrophage dissemination and polarization, contributing to HIV-1 pathogenesis (Vekariya2018HIV1).

In tumor-associated macrophages, POTEE interacts with proteins such as mTOR, Rictor, and Rad51, facilitating mTORC2 activation. This interaction is important for cell invasion and survival, highlighting POTEE's role in cancer progression (Vekariya2019Identification).
