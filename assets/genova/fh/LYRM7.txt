# LYRM7

## Overview
The LYRM7 gene encodes the LYR motif containing 7 protein, also known as MZM1L, which is integral to mitochondrial function. This protein acts as a chaperone, specifically facilitating the assembly of mitochondrial complex III (CIII) by stabilizing the Rieske Fe-S protein (UQCRFS1) within the mitochondrial matrix before its integration into the complex. LYRM7 is primarily located in the mitochondrial matrix but also associates with mitochondrial membranes, underscoring its role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and energy production (Sánchez2013LYRM7MZM1L). Mutations in the LYRM7 gene can lead to severe mitochondrial disorders, emphasizing its critical function in cellular respiration and energy metabolism (Dallabona2016LYRM7mutations). Additionally, LYRM7's interactions with other mitochondrial proteins suggest its involvement in broader mitochondrial processes, further highlighting its importance in cellular homeostasis (Majmudar20194′Phosphopantetheine).

## Function
The LYRM7 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the assembly of mitochondrial complex III (CIII) in human cells. This protein, also known as MZM1L, functions as a chaperone for the Rieske Fe-S protein (UQCRFS1), a crucial subunit of CIII. LYRM7 binds to UQCRFS1 within the mitochondrial matrix, stabilizing it before its translocation and insertion into the late CIII dimeric intermediate in the mitochondrial inner membrane (Sánchez2013LYRM7MZM1L). This process is essential for the formation of a mature and functional CIII enzyme, which is central to the mitochondrial respiratory chain, facilitating electron transfer and proton translocation necessary for ATP synthesis (Sánchez2013LYRM7MZM1L).

LYRM7 is primarily located in the soluble mitochondrial fraction, consistent with its role in the mitochondrial matrix, but it also associates peripherally with mitochondrial membranes (Sánchez2013LYRM7MZM1L). The protein's function is vital for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production, as it ensures the proper assembly and stability of complex III components (Invernizzi2013A). Mutations in LYRM7 can lead to severe mitochondrial disorders, highlighting its importance in cellular respiration and energy metabolism (Dallabona2016LYRM7mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LYRM7 gene are associated with several severe mitochondrial disorders. These mutations can lead to a condition known as multifocal cavitating leukoencephalopathy, characterized by distinct MRI appearances with signal abnormalities and small cysts in the cerebral white matter. Patients with these mutations often exhibit symptoms such as delayed motor development, subacute neurological deterioration, and repeated episodes of encephalopathy (Dallabona2016LYRM7mutations). 

The LYRM7 gene is crucial for the assembly of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III, and mutations can result in a severe reduction of complex III activity. This deficiency is linked to early onset encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and severe neurological symptoms (Invernizzi2013A). 

In some cases, mutations in LYRM7 have been associated with a progressive spastic ataxic syndrome in adults, mimicking leukodystrophy without typical mitochondrial markers, highlighting the variability in clinical presentation (Cherian2021Multifocal). 

Alterations in LYRM7 expression have also been studied in the context of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), where it is differentially expressed in lung tissue, suggesting a potential role in the disease's pathogenesis (Jing2023A).

## Interactions
LYRM7, also known as MZM1L, is involved in the assembly of mitochondrial complex III and interacts with several proteins to fulfill its role. It acts as a chaperone for the Rieske Fe-S protein, UQCRFS1, stabilizing it within the mitochondrial matrix before its incorporation into complex III. This interaction is crucial for the proper assembly and function of complex III (Sánchez2013LYRM7MZM1L). 

LYRM7 interacts with the co-chaperone HSC20, which may help protect the Rieske subunit from oxidative stress, ensuring its stability until it is inserted into the membrane (Angerer2015Eukaryotic). The interaction between LYRM7 and UQCRFS1 has been demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation analyses, indicating a physical association that is essential for the stabilization or assembly of UQCRFS1 within the mitochondria (Sánchez2013LYRM7MZM1L).

In addition to its role in complex III assembly, LYRM7 has been identified as a component of the mitochondrial acyl-carrier protein (ACPM) interactome, suggesting its involvement in broader mitochondrial functions (Majmudar20194′Phosphopantetheine). These interactions highlight LYRM7's critical role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function.
