# ZNF479

## Overview
ZNF479 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 479, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs that facilitate DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including epigenetic regulation and transcriptional repression, primarily through its interactions with other proteins such as those in the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) complex and DNA methylation machinery (Wu2019ZNF479). ZNF479 has been implicated in the progression of several cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma and gastric cancer, where it influences cell proliferation and gene expression through pathways such as β-catenin/c-Myc signaling (Wu2019ZNF479; Jin2021Knockdown). The protein's role in cancer biology highlights its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention and its significance as a putative cancer driver gene (Ashford2018A).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF479 has been implicated in several types of cancer due to its role in transcriptional regulation and gene expression. In gastric cancer, ZNF479 is upregulated and contributes to disease progression by enhancing glycolysis and cell proliferation through the β-catenin/c-Myc signaling pathway. Knockdown of ZNF479 in gastric cancer cell lines has been shown to reduce cell proliferation and glycolysis, suggesting its potential as an oncogene and a target for therapeutic strategies (Jin2021Knockdown).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ZNF479 is involved in the suppression of metallothionein-1 (MT-1) expression, which is associated with poor prognosis. ZNF479 expression is higher in HCC tissues and is linked to increased cell proliferation and tumor growth. It regulates the expression of DNMT1, UHRF1, and components of the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) complex, contributing to epigenetic changes that promote cancer progression (Wu2019ZNF479).

ZNF479 has also been identified as a putative cancer driver gene through computational analysis, indicating its potential involvement in cancer-related processes and pathways (Ashford2018A). In well-differentiated papillary mesothelioma, ZNF479 has been noted for copy number loss, although specific disease associations are not detailed (Shrestha2020WellDifferentiated).

## Interactions
ZNF479 interacts with several proteins and is involved in complex regulatory networks in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It is known to interact with components of the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) complex, including ASH2L and Menin, which are crucial for histone methylation processes. These interactions lead to increased tri-methylation of histone H3 (H3K4me3) and decreased dimethylation (H3K4me2), contributing to the epigenetic regulation of metallothionein-1 (MT-1) expression (Wu2019ZNF479).

ZNF479 also interacts with DNMT1 and UHRF1, proteins involved in DNA methylation, suggesting a role in epigenetic repression of gene expression. Overexpression of ZNF479 increases the expression of DNMT1 and UHRF1, while knockdown of ZNF479 reduces their expression (Wu2019ZNF479). The protein's interactions with these factors are part of a broader regulatory network that influences MT-1 expression and cell proliferation in HCC (Wu2019ZNF479).

ZNF479 expression is upregulated by 14-3-3ε, which further influences its regulatory activities. The protein contains a KRAB domain, known for transcriptional repression, indicating that ZNF479 may regulate these proteins indirectly (Wu2019ZNF479).
