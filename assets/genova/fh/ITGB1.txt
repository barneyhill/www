# ITGB1

## Overview
The ITGB1 gene encodes the integrin subunit beta 1, a transmembrane glycoprotein that is a crucial component of the integrin family of cell adhesion receptors. Integrin subunit beta 1 is involved in mediating interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM), playing a pivotal role in cellular adhesion, migration, and signal transduction. This protein is integral to various physiological processes, including tissue repair, immune response, and mechanotransduction, by facilitating bidirectional signaling across the plasma membrane (Zeng2015Integrinβ1; Su2024Integrinβ-1). ITGB1 forms heterodimers with different alpha subunits, resulting in diverse integrin receptors that contribute to its functional versatility in cellular processes (Su2024Integrinβ-1). The gene's expression and the protein's interactions are implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer progression and viral infections, underscoring its significance as a potential therapeutic target (Shuai2020Integrin; Xie2021ITGB1).

## Structure
Integrin subunit beta 1 (ITGB1) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that forms part of the integrin family, which are cell adhesion receptors. The primary structure of ITGB1 includes a sequence of approximately 798 amino acids in its most studied isoform, β1-A (Su2024Integrinβ-1). The secondary structure features a 19-residue α-helix within the cytosolic domain, which is highly conserved across vertebrates (Holmes2011Comparative). 

The tertiary structure of ITGB1 includes a globular head and a tail, with specific domains such as the plexin-semaphorin-integrin (PSI) domain, a hybrid domain with an I-like domain (βI), an integrin epidermal growth factor-like (I-EGF) domain, and a β-tail domain (Su2024Integrinβ-1). The quaternary structure involves heterodimerization with various α subunits, allowing ITGB1 to form 24 different integrin heterodimers (Su2024Integrinβ-1).

ITGB1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and phosphorylation, which are crucial for its function. The protein also has multiple splice variant isoforms, such as ITB1a-ITB1f, which exhibit different expression patterns and functional properties (Naipauer2013The; Holmes2011Comparative). These isoforms contribute to the functional diversity of ITGB1 in various cellular processes.

## Function
Integrin subunit beta 1 (ITGB1) is a critical component of the integrin family, which are transmembrane receptors that mediate cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions. ITGB1 plays a vital role in cell adhesion, spreading, and maintaining the stability of blood vessel walls. It is involved in bidirectional signaling across the plasma membrane, influencing cellular responses to the extracellular environment and affecting processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Su2024Integrinβ-1).

In healthy human cells, ITGB1 is essential for maintaining cell adhesion and transmitting biochemical and mechanical signals between cells and their environment. It interacts with various ligands, including collagen and laminin, contributing to cell adhesion and signaling processes (Su2024Integrinβ-1). ITGB1 is also involved in the regulation of osteoblastic differentiation and ECM formation, particularly under mechanical tensile strain, highlighting its role as a mechanotransducer (Zeng2015Integrinβ1).

ITGB1 is active in various cellular locations, including the cell membrane, where it interacts with ECM components and other cell surface receptors. It is crucial for the structural and functional integrity of cells, influencing processes such as tissue repair and immune response (Xie2023ITGB1).

## Clinical Significance
The ITGB1 gene, encoding integrin subunit beta 1, plays a significant role in various cancers, with its altered expression linked to disease progression and poor prognosis. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ITGB1 is highly expressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, correlating with advanced clinical stages and poorer overall survival. Its expression is associated with cell cycle regulation through interactions with proteins like PXN, YWHAZ, and AKT, which are implicated in cell cycle processes (Xie2021ITGB1).

In gastric cancer, ITGB1 overexpression is linked to worse pathological staging and prognosis. It is associated with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint expression, suggesting a role in tumor immunosuppression and immune evasion. ITGB1 expression correlates with PD-L1, indicating its potential as a biomarker for predicting responses to immunotherapy (Xu2023Evaluation).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ITGB1 contributes to radioresistance by modulating the DNA damage response and inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Its expression is positively correlated with YAP1, and high levels of both genes are associated with shorter overall survival (Li2021ITGB1). These findings highlight ITGB1's role in cancer progression and resistance to therapy, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
Integrin subunit beta 1 (ITGB1) is involved in various physical interactions with other proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular processes. ITGB1 directly interacts with the rabies virus glycoprotein (RABV G), facilitating the entry of the rabies virus into host cells. This interaction is specific to the ectodomains of both ITGB1 and RABV G, and it is crucial for the virus's ability to infect cells (Shuai2020Integrin). ITGB1 also interacts with fibronectin (FN) through Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motifs, which is important for rabies virus infection. Blocking this interaction with an RGD peptide can inhibit the infection process (Shuai2020Integrin).

In the context of cancer, ITGB1 interacts with caveolin-1 (CAV1) in prostate cancer, where it regulates CAV1 expression. This interaction is significant for cell adhesion and is associated with the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer progression (Pellinen2018ITGB1dependent). ITGB1 also interacts with thrombospondin 4 (THBS4) in hepatocellular carcinoma, promoting cell migration and invasion through the FAK/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (Guo2020THBS4). These interactions highlight ITGB1's role in both viral infections and cancer progression.
