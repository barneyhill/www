# TRMT10C

## Overview
TRMT10C is a gene that encodes the protein tRNA methyltransferase 10C, mitochondrial RNase P subunit, also known as MRPP1. This protein is a crucial component of the mitochondrial RNase P complex, which is involved in the processing and maturation of mitochondrial tRNAs (mt-tRNAs). As a tRNA methyltransferase, TRMT10C plays a significant role in the methylation of purines at position 9 in mt-tRNAs, a modification essential for their proper folding and stability. This function is vital for mitochondrial protein synthesis and energy production. Additionally, TRMT10C is involved in the assembly and stability of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, particularly complexes I and IV, thereby supporting efficient mitochondrial function and cellular energy metabolism (Metodiev2016Recessive; Vilardo2012A). The protein's activity is integral to maintaining mitochondrial RNA processing and overall mitochondrial health, with implications in various clinical conditions, including mitochondrial diseases, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer (Metodiev2016Recessive; Jörg2024N1methylation; Zhao2024TRMT10Cmediated).

## Function
TRMT10C encodes a protein that functions as a subunit of the mitochondrial RNase P complex, which is crucial for the processing of mitochondrial tRNAs (mt-tRNAs) in human cells. This protein, also known as MRPP1, is involved in the 5' cleavage of mt-tRNAs from polycistronic precursor transcripts, a critical step in tRNA maturation necessary for proper mitochondrial function (Metodiev2016Recessive). 

TRMT10C, in conjunction with SDR5C1, forms a complex that acts as a tRNA:m1R9 methyltransferase, responsible for methylating purines at position 9 in mt-tRNAs. This methylation is essential for the correct folding and stability of mt-tRNAs, which are vital for mitochondrial protein synthesis and energy production (Vilardo2012A). The TRMT10C/SDR5C1 complex also plays a role in ensuring the integrity of pre-tRNA structures, acting as a checkpoint during tRNA maturation (Meynier2024Structural).

In healthy cells, TRMT10C supports the assembly and stability of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, particularly complexes I and IV, thereby maintaining efficient mitochondrial function and cellular energy metabolism (Metodiev2016Recessive). The protein is active in the mitochondria, contributing to overall mitochondrial RNA processing and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TRMT10C gene have been linked to mitochondrial diseases characterized by multiple respiratory chain deficiencies. These mutations impair mitochondrial RNA processing, leading to decreased levels of the MRPP1 protein and an accumulation of mitochondrial RNA precursors. This results in defective mitochondrial protein synthesis and insufficient ATP production from oxidative phosphorylation. Clinically, affected individuals present with lactic acidosis, hypotonia, feeding difficulties, and deafness at birth, often leading to early death due to respiratory failure (Metodiev2016Recessive).

In Alzheimer's disease, TRMT10C is implicated in the N1-methylation of adenosine in ND5 mRNA, which contributes to complex I dysfunction in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This dysfunction is associated with mitochondrial impairment, potentially contributing to the neurodegenerative processes observed in Alzheimer's disease. Increased TRMT10C protein levels have been observed in Alzheimer's disease models and patient tissues, suggesting a role in disease pathology (Jörg2024N1methylation).

In lung cancer, TRMT10C is involved in the m7G modification of circFAM126A, a circular RNA. This modification enhances the stability of circFAM126A, which is downregulated in lung cancer tissues. TRMT10C's role in this process suggests it may influence cancer progression by affecting cellular glycolysis and tumor cell survival (Zhao2024TRMT10Cmediated).

## Interactions
TRMT10C is a component of the mitochondrial RNase P complex, which is crucial for mitochondrial tRNA processing. It interacts with MRPP1 (also known as HSD17B10) and MRPP2 (also) to form a complex responsible for the 5' end processing of mitochondrial precursor tRNAs (Metodiev2016Recessive). TRMT10C, in conjunction with SDR5C1, forms a subcomplex that acts as a bifunctional tRNA methyltransferase, essential for the methylation of guanosine and adenosine at position 9 in mitochondrial tRNAs (Vilardo2012A). This interaction is necessary for TRMT10C's methyltransferase activity, as TRMT10C alone does not exhibit this activity (Vilardo2012A).

The TRMT10C-SDR5C1 complex also interacts with the pre-tRNA substrate, forming a shape-complementary platform that facilitates the proper folding and methylation of pre-tRNA segments (Bhatta2021Structural). TRMT10C interacts with PRORP within the mtRNase P complex, stabilizing the open conformation of PRORP necessary for RNA cleavage (Bhatta2021Structural). These interactions highlight TRMT10C's role in both methylation and processing activities, although these functions are independent of each other (Vilardo2012A).
