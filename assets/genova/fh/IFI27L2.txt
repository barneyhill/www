# IFI27L2

## Overview
IFI27L2 is a gene that encodes the protein interferon alpha inducible protein 27 like 2, which is part of the interferon-stimulated gene (ISG)12 family. This protein is involved in the cellular response to type 1 interferons and plays a role in apoptotic processes. It is categorized as an interferon-inducible protein, which suggests its involvement in immune modulation and inflammatory responses. The expression of IFI27L2 is associated with various pathological conditions, including autoimmune diseases such as Sjögren’s Syndrome, where it contributes to disease progression through interactions with the interferon signaling pathway (He2024Interplay). Additionally, IFI27L2 is implicated in myeloproliferative neoplasms, where it is linked to thromboinflammatory profiles, and in cancer research, where it is upregulated in response to specific treatments, indicating its potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target (Skov2012Gene; Shen2021Platelet; Chen2020Akkermansia).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the IFI27L2 gene have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Sjögren’s Syndrome (SS), an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation. IFI27L2 expression is positively associated with the risk of developing SS, and it interacts with NGF-β through the interferon signaling pathway, contributing to the disease's progression (He2024Interplay). The gene is part of the interferon-stimulated gene (ISG)12 family and is involved in apoptotic processes induced by type 1 interferon, which may exacerbate inflammatory responses in SS (He2024Interplay).

In the context of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), IFI27L2 is upregulated and associated with a thromboinflammatory profile, particularly in essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV). This suggests a role in the pro-thrombotic and pro-fibrotic phenotypes observed in these conditions, potentially serving as a biomarker or therapeutic target (Skov2012Gene; Shen2021Platelet).

In cancer research, the expression of IFI27L2, specifically its mouse homolog IFI27l2a, is upregulated in response to treatments combining Akkermansia muciniphila and cisplatin, indicating its involvement in modulating immune responses and enhancing antitumor effects (Chen2020Akkermansia).
