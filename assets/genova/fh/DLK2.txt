# DLK2

## Overview
DLK2 (delta like non-canonical Notch ligand 2) is a gene that encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein involved in the Notch signaling pathway, which is pivotal for cell communication and influences cell fate decisions. The protein, also known as epidermal growth factor-like domain multiple 9 (EGFL9), is characterized by its single-pass transmembrane structure and the presence of multiple epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions (Chen2023Dlk2; Rivero2011Characterization). DLK2 is expressed in various tissues, including the lung, liver, brain, and adipose tissues, and plays a significant role in regulating cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis (Chen2023Dlk2). Its involvement in critical signaling pathways, such as the Akt signaling pathway during osteoclast formation, underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and development (Chen2023Dlk2). Additionally, DLK2's interactions with proteins like Syap1 and Numb highlight its role in modulating pathways related to neurogenesis and cancer (Telerman2023Posttranslational).

## Structure
The DLK2 protein, also known as epidermal growth factor-like domain multiple 9 (EGFL9), is a single-pass transmembrane glycoprotein composed of 382 amino acids. It features three functional regions: an extracellular region with six EGF-like repeated domains, a single transmembrane region, and a short intracellular region (Chen2023Dlk2; Rivero2011Characterization). These EGF-like domains are crucial for mediating protein-protein interactions and are characterized by a conserved cysteine-rich motif, which is typical of the EGF-like family of proteins (Rivero2011Characterization).

DLK2 shares significant structural similarities with DLK1, particularly in the EGF-like domains, suggesting a potential compensatory role between these proteins (Macedo2019DLK1). The protein is widely expressed in various tissues, including the lung, liver, brain, and adipose tissues, and is involved in cell signaling pathways, such as the Akt signaling pathway during osteoclast formation (Chen2023Dlk2).

DLK2 may undergo post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which is common for glycoproteins and may influence its function and stability (Rivero2011Characterization). The presence of multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing is also a possibility, although specific isoforms are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
DLK2 (delta like non-canonical Notch ligand 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the Notch signaling pathway, a critical mechanism for cell communication that influences cell fate decisions. The DLK2 protein plays a significant role in regulating cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis, processes essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and development. It is expressed in various tissues, indicating its involvement in multiple physiological processes, including adipogenesis and neurogenesis.

The activity of DLK2 is primarily localized to the cell membrane, where it interacts with other signaling molecules to modulate cellular outcomes. By participating in the Notch signaling pathway, DLK2 influences the transcriptional regulation of target genes that are crucial for cell cycle control and differentiation. This interaction at the cell membrane is vital for the protein's function in transmitting extracellular signals to the cell's interior, thereby affecting gene expression patterns that determine cell behavior.

DLK2's role in adipogenesis suggests it may contribute to the development and function of adipose tissue, while its involvement in neurogenesis points to a potential function in the formation and maintenance of neural structures. These activities underscore the importance of DLK2 in both cellular and organismal contexts, highlighting its contribution to the complex network of signaling pathways that govern human development and tissue homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the DLK2 gene have been associated with various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and neurogenesis. In cancer, reduced levels of DLK2 are linked to poorer prognosis. Specifically, decreased expression of DLK2 is observed in low-grade gliomas and glioblastomas, correlating with reduced survival rates. Similarly, in breast cancer, both DLK2 and Numb expressions are decreased in tumor tissues, with lower DLK2 expression associated with reduced patient survival (Telerman2023Posttranslational). The interaction between DLK2 and Numb is significant, as DLK2 is involved in modulating the Numb/Notch pathway, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and tumor suppressor functions (Telerman2023Posttranslational).

In neurogenesis, DLK2 is essential for the maintenance of radial glial cells and secondary neurogenesis, processes regulated by Notch signaling. In zebrafish models, depletion of DLK2 leads to increased Notch signaling, affecting neuronal behavior and resulting in heightened startle responses to stimuli. This phenotype is similar to the Numb/Numblike knockout phenotype in mice, suggesting a relationship between DLK2 and Numb in neurodevelopmental processes (Telerman2023Posttranslational). These findings highlight the potential role of DLK2 in both neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer, with its expression levels and interactions playing critical roles in these conditions.

## Interactions
DLK2 (delta like non-canonical Notch ligand 2) is involved in several protein-protein interactions that influence various biological processes. One significant interaction is with the protein Syap1, which is crucial for activating the Akt signaling pathway during osteoclast formation. This interaction promotes the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473, essential for osteoclast differentiation and bone remodeling (Chen2023Dlk2).

DLK2 also interacts with the Numb protein, a negative regulator of Notch signaling. This interaction is important in neurogenesis and cancer, as DLK2 prevents aberrant phosphorylation of Numb, enhancing its ability to repress Notch signaling. This interaction is significant in regulating embryonic brain development and cancer cell proliferation (Telerman2023Posttranslational).

Additionally, DLK2 interacts with the E3 ligase Mdm2, which targets Numb for ubiquitination. The interaction between DLK2 and Mdm2 suggests that DLK2 might inhibit the interaction between Numb and Mdm2, thereby influencing Numb's stability and function (Telerman2023Posttranslational).

These interactions highlight DLK2's role in modulating signaling pathways related to cell differentiation, neurogenesis, and cancer.
