# SLC2A12

## Overview
SLC2A12 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 2 member 12 (GLUT12), which is a facilitative glucose transporter. GLUT12 is part of the larger solute carrier family and is characterized by its 12 transmembrane domains, a structural feature that enables its function in glucose transport across cell membranes. This protein is predominantly expressed in insulin-sensitive tissues such as skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, where it plays a crucial role in glucose uptake in response to insulin. Additionally, GLUT12 is found in various other tissues, including the mammary gland, kidney, and heart, indicating its broad physiological significance. The protein's activity is regulated by factors such as insulin and protein kinases, and it is involved in processes like glucose absorption in the small intestine. Alterations in SLC2A12 expression have been linked to clinical conditions such as hyperuricemia, gout, and prostate cancer, underscoring its importance in both metabolic and proliferative disorders (Augustin2010The; White2018GLUT12; Mueckler2013The).

## Structure
SLC2A12, also known as GLUT12, is a member of the solute carrier family involved in glucose transport. The protein is characterized by 12 transmembrane domains, a common feature among GLUT family members, which facilitates its role in transporting glucose across cell membranes (Augustin2010The; Mueckler2013The). Both the N- and C-termini of GLUT12 are cytoplasmic, aligning with the typical topology of GLUT proteins (Augustin2010The; Mueckler2013The).

GLUT12 contains dileucine motifs at both the N- and C-terminal ends, which are similar to the [DE]XXXL[LI] consensus sequence found in GLUT8, associated with endosomal/lysosomal sorting signals (Augustin2010The). However, GLUT12 is primarily localized to the Golgi network and the plasma membrane, rather than colocalizing with GLUT8 (Augustin2010The; Mueckler2013The).

The protein's subcellular targeting is influenced by a dileucine motif within its N-terminal cytoplasmic domain (Mueckler2013The). Insulin stimulation induces the translocation of GLUT12 to the plasma membrane, enhancing its role in glucose uptake (Augustin2010The; Mueckler2013The). Despite its functional significance, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of GLUT12 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The SLC2A12 gene encodes the GLUT12 protein, a facilitative glucose transporter involved in the transport of glucose across cell membranes. GLUT12 is primarily active in insulin-sensitive tissues, such as skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, where it functions alongside GLUT4 to facilitate glucose uptake in response to insulin. In skeletal muscle, GLUT12 is translocated to the plasma membrane upon insulin stimulation, predominantly in type I muscle fibers, and accounts for approximately 12% of insulin-translocable glucose transporters in these tissues (PujolGiménez2012The).

GLUT12 is also expressed in various other tissues, including the mammary gland, kidney, spleen, heart, intestine, testis, and prostate. It is located in intracellular vesicles and is transported to the plasma membrane by insulin, similar to GLUT4. The protein mediates glucose transport, which is inhibited by D-galactose and D-fructose, and has high-affinity glucose transport properties (Matsuo2020Functional).

In the small intestine, GLUT12 is involved in glucose absorption, with its translocation to the membrane influenced by extracellular glucose, insulin, and TNF-α. It is regulated by protein kinases such as PKC and AMPK, and its activity is increased by protons, suggesting a role in proton-coupled glucose symport (Gil‐Iturbe2018GLUT12).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SLC2A12 gene, also known as GLUT12, have been implicated in several clinical conditions. In the context of hyperuricemia and gout, SLC2A12 has been identified as a physiological urate transporter. Dysfunction in this gene can lead to elevated blood urate concentrations, suggesting that mutations or changes in SLC2A12 expression may contribute to hyperuricemia and gout (Toyoda2020Identification).

In prostate cancer, SLC2A12 is overexpressed and regulated by androgen receptor (AR) signaling. This overexpression is associated with increased glucose uptake and cell growth in prostate cancer cells. The gene's expression is significantly elevated in prostate cancer tissues compared to benign controls, and its regulation by AR is confirmed through experiments involving AR knockdown and antiandrogens (White2018GLUT12). The involvement of SLC2A12 in glucose metabolism is further supported by its regulation through the CaMKK2-AMPK signaling pathway, which affects GLUT12 trafficking to the plasma membrane, crucial for glucose uptake in cancer cells (White2018GLUT12).

These findings highlight the potential role of SLC2A12 in metabolic and proliferative disorders, particularly in the context of urate transport and cancer cell metabolism.
