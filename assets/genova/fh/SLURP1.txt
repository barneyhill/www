# SLURP1

## Overview
SLURP1 is a gene that encodes the secreted protein LY6/PLAUR domain containing 1, which is a member of the Ly6/uPAR/three-finger neurotoxin family. This protein is characterized by its three-fingered structural motif, stabilized by disulfide bonds, and is predominantly involved in maintaining epithelial integrity and modulating immune responses. SLURP1 acts as a ligand for the α7 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7-nAChR), influencing keratinocyte functions and exerting antiproliferative effects. It also plays a role in immune modulation by inhibiting inflammatory cytokine production. Clinically, mutations in the SLURP1 gene are linked to Mal de Meleda, a rare form of palmoplantar keratoderma, highlighting its significance in skin health and disease (Campbell2019The; Akbar2019Novel; Bychkov2021SLURP1).

## Structure
The SLURP1 protein is characterized by a three-fingered structural motif, typical of the Ly6/uPAR/three-finger neurotoxin family. This motif is stabilized by five disulfide bonds, which are crucial for maintaining its structure (Adeyo2015Heterogeneity; Durek2017Interaction). The primary structure of SLURP1 consists of 81 amino acids, with a specific arrangement of 10 cysteine residues that form these disulfide bonds (Adeyo2015Heterogeneity). 

The secondary structure is predominantly β-structured, as revealed by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, which shows that about 60% of the protein's secondary structure is composed of β-sheets (Kost2023Comparison). The tertiary structure is defined by a disulfide-stabilized core with three elongated loops, or "fingers," protruding from it, a configuration confirmed by NMR studies (Durek2017Interaction). 

SLURP1 does not form quaternary structures as it is predominantly monomeric, although mutations can lead to dimer and multimer formation, affecting its function (Adeyo2015Heterogeneity). The protein is secreted and may undergo post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which are common in secreted proteins (Adeyo2015Heterogeneity).

## Function
SLURP1, a secreted protein, plays a crucial role in maintaining epithelial integrity and modulating immune responses. It is highly expressed in mucosal epithelial cells, particularly in the corneal epithelium, where it stabilizes epithelial cell junctions and enhances barrier function by increasing the expression of junctional proteins such as DSG1, DSP, TJP1, and E-Cadherin (Campbell2019The). SLURP1 acts as a ligand for the α7 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7-nAChR), exerting antiproliferative effects on epithelial cells and modulating keratinocyte functions through nAChR-mediated pathways (Campbell2019The; Lyukmanova2016Human).

SLURP1 also plays a role in immune modulation by suppressing TNF-α-induced inflammatory cytokine production, which is linked to its ability to inhibit the nuclear translocation of NF-κB, a key regulator of cytokine production (Campbell2019The). It is involved in regulating inflammation, vascularization, and cytokine secretion during infections, such as COVID-19 (Bychkov2021SLURP1). Additionally, SLURP1 has been shown to counteract the tumorigenic effects of tobacco-derived nitrosamines and is implicated in protecting against malignant transformation (Campbell2019The; Chernyavsky2010Upregulation). These functions highlight SLURP1's potential as a therapeutic target in various conditions, including cancer and inflammatory diseases.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLURP1 gene are primarily associated with Mal de Meleda (MDM), a rare autosomal recessive form of palmoplantar keratoderma (PPK). This condition is characterized by severe hyperkeratosis of the palms and soles, often accompanied by erythema, nail abnormalities, and flexion contractures. The disorder typically begins in infancy and progresses throughout life, potentially leading to constrictive bands and spontaneous amputation (Akbar2019Novel; Thomas2020Diagnosis; Fischer2001Mutations).

MDM is caused by various mutations in the SLURP1 gene, including nonsense mutations that result in truncated protein synthesis due to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. These mutations disrupt the normal function of SLURP1, which is involved in promoting keratinocyte apoptosis and regulating skin cell growth (Akbar2019Novel; Wang2023Identification). Over 20 mutations in SLURP1 have been reported, with some variants being more prevalent in specific populations, such as the p.Gly86Arg mutation in Asian patients (Wang2023Identification).

Alterations in SLURP1 expression or function can lead to impaired skin barrier function and inflammation, contributing to the pathogenesis of MDM and potentially other skin conditions (Fischer2001Mutations).

## Interactions
SLURP1 interacts with various proteins, particularly nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). It is known to modulate the α7-nAChR subtype, acting as a negative modulator in certain contexts. SLURP1's interaction with α7-nAChR involves multiple contact points, primarily through loop I of SLURP1, and mutations in this loop can reduce its affinity for the receptor (Bychkov2021SLURP1). SLURP1 also forms complexes with receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGFR and PDGFRα, which are involved in its antiproliferative and anti-migration activities in lung adenocarcinoma cells (Bychkov2021SLURP1).

In addition to its interactions with nAChRs, SLURP1 has been shown to interact with Secreted frizzled-related protein 5 (Sfrp5) in the context of lipid metabolism. This interaction is significant in regulating triglyceride synthesis and accumulation in hepatocyte steatosis models (Zhao2019Sfrp5). The interaction between SLURP1 and Sfrp5 was confirmed through co-transfection experiments and immunoprecipitation assays, indicating a regulatory role in lipid metabolism (Zhao2019Sfrp5).

These interactions highlight SLURP1's role in modulating various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, migration, and lipid metabolism, through its interactions with different proteins and receptors.
