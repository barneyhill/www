# KREMEN1

## Overview
KREMEN1 is a gene that encodes the kringle containing transmembrane protein 1, a type I transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the Wnt signaling pathway. This protein functions primarily as a receptor, interacting with Dickkopf proteins (DKKs) to regulate cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The kringle containing transmembrane protein 1 is characterized by its structural domains, including the Kringle, WSC, and CUB domains, which facilitate its interactions with co-receptors and ligands. Notably, KREMEN1 is involved in the formation of a ternary complex with DKK1 and LRP6, leading to the inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling. Beyond its role in cellular signaling, KREMEN1 has been implicated in viral pathogenesis, serving as an alternative receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and a critical host factor for Coxsackievirus A10 infection (Staring2018KREMEN1; Gu2021Receptome). The gene's mutations have been associated with developmental disorders, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Zebisch2016Structure).

## Structure
KREMEN1 is a type I transmembrane protein involved in the Wnt signaling pathway. It features a 40 kDa ectodomain composed of three structural domains: the Kringle domain (KR), the WSC domain, and the CUB domain. These domains interact tightly to form a single structural unit, with the Kringle and WSC domains forming the interface with Dickkopf proteins (DKKs), and the CUB domain interacting directly with the LRP6 co-receptor (Zebisch2016Structure). The Kringle domain contains three disulfide bridges and is low in secondary structure elements, similar to the Kringle domain of human plasminogen (Zebisch2016Structure). The WSC domain is characterized by an antiparallel β-sheet and a single α-helix, stabilized by four disulfide bridges (Zebisch2016Structure). The CUB domain has two glycosylation sites, although detailed modeling of one site was not possible due to insufficient electron density (Zebisch2016Structure).

KREMEN1 can form homodimers through its extracellular domain, a process crucial for its function as a dependence receptor, which can be inhibited by DKK1 binding (Sumia2019Kremen1induced). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation (Zebisch2016Structure).

## Function
KREMEN1 encodes a transmembrane protein that functions as a high-affinity receptor for Dickkopf 1 (Dkk1), playing a crucial role in the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This pathway is essential for various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. KREMEN1, in conjunction with Dkk1, forms a ternary complex with the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6), effectively inhibiting canonical Wnt signaling by promoting the internalization and removal of LRP6 from the cell surface (Mao2002Kremen; Mishra2012HighAffinity).

The internalization of KREMEN1 is mediated by clathrin and involves a unique leucine-valine sorting signal in its cytosolic tail, which is crucial for its clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This process is important for regulating receptor availability and signal transduction, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis (Mishra2012HighAffinity).

KREMEN1 is expressed in various tissues during early developmental stages, including sensory organs, lung, and heart, where it functions as a Wnt inhibitor, crucial for normal embryonic development (Mishra2012HighAffinity). Its role in modulating Wnt signaling impacts processes such as cell-fate determination, tissue patterning, and stem cell regulation (Nakamura2007The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the KREMEN1 gene have significant clinical implications. A homozygous mutation in the ectodomain of KREMEN1 has been linked to severe ectodermal dysplasia, including oligodontia, which underscores its importance in normal human development (Zebisch2016Structure). Specifically, the F207S mutation found in Palestinian families destabilizes the protein structure, affecting its role in Wnt signaling and leading to ectodermal dysplasia (Zebisch2016Structure).

KREMEN1 also plays a role in viral pathogenesis. It acts as a critical host factor for Coxsackievirus A10 (CV-A10) infection, facilitating viral entry into host cells. Mice deficient in KREMEN1 show resistance to CV-A10 infection, highlighting its significance in viral infections (Staring2018KREMEN1). Additionally, KREMEN1 serves as an alternative receptor for SARS-CoV-2, independent of the ACE2 receptor, contributing to the virus's ability to infect multiple organs and cell types (Gu2021Receptome). This role in viral entry suggests that KREMEN1 could be a potential target for antiviral therapeutics against enteroviruses and SARS-CoV-2 (Gu2021Receptome).

These findings indicate that KREMEN1's interactions and mutations can have diverse and significant impacts on human health, affecting both developmental processes and susceptibility to viral infections.

## Interactions
KREMEN1 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in the regulation of Wnt signaling and apoptosis. It acts as a high-affinity receptor for Dickkopf proteins (Dkk1, Dkk2, and Dkk4), forming a complex with the Wnt co-receptor LRP6. This interaction leads to the endocytosis and removal of LRP6 from the cell surface, thereby inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling (Mao2002Kremen; Zebisch2016Structure). KREMEN1 can also form a ternary complex with DKK1 and LRP6, which has been structurally characterized to provide insights into its role in modulating Wnt signaling (Zebisch2016Structure).

KREMEN1 undergoes homodimerization, which is crucial for its pro-apoptotic activity. It can also form heterodimers with its paralog KREMEN2, which inhibits KREMEN1-induced apoptosis by preventing its homodimerization (Sumia2019Kremen1induced). The extracellular domain of KREMEN1 is essential for these dimerization processes (Sumia2019Kremen1induced).

Additionally, KREMEN1 has been identified as an alternative receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, binding with high affinity to the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein, which suggests a role in viral entry (Gu2021Receptome).
