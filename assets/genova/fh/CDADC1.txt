# CDADC1

## Overview
The CDADC1 gene encodes the protein cytidine and dCMP deaminase domain containing 1, which is integral to nucleotide metabolism and cell cycle regulation. This protein is characterized by domains typical of cytidine and dCMP deaminases, enzymes that are crucial for the deamination processes involved in DNA repair and RNA editing. By facilitating the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase of the cell cycle, CDADC1 plays a pivotal role in controlling cell proliferation and maintaining genomic stability. The protein's ability to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm suggests its involvement in diverse cellular processes, contributing to cellular homeostasis. Dysregulation of CDADC1, particularly through epigenetic modifications, has been linked to adverse cancer prognoses, underscoring its significance in both normal cellular function and disease pathology (Shivakumar2017Identification).

## Structure


## Function
The CDADC1 gene encodes a protein involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, particularly influencing cell proliferation by controlling the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase. This regulation is crucial for maintaining proper cell growth and preventing uncontrolled proliferation, which is a hallmark of cancerous cells (Shivakumar2017Identification). The CDADC1 protein contains domains characteristic of cytidine and dCMP deaminases, enzymes that play a significant role in nucleotide metabolism. These enzymes catalyze the removal of an amino group from cytidine or deoxycytidine monophosphate (dCMP), processes essential for DNA repair and RNA editing. This activity helps maintain nucleotide pool balance, ensuring genomic stability and proper cellular function (Shivakumar2017Identification).

CDADC1 is known to dynamically shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm, indicating its involvement in both nuclear and cytoplasmic processes. Its activity in these cellular compartments underscores its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and genomic integrity (Shivakumar2017Identification). In the context of cancer, dysregulation of CDADC1, such as through high epigenetic control leading to lower expression, is associated with worse survival outcomes, highlighting its importance in normal cellular function and its potential disruption in disease states (Shivakumar2017Identification).
