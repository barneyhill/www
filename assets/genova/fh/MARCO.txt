# MARCO

## Overview
The MARCO gene encodes the macrophage receptor with collagenous structure, a type II transmembrane protein that is predominantly expressed in macrophages. This receptor is classified as a class A scavenger receptor and plays a pivotal role in the innate immune system by mediating the recognition and clearance of various pathogens, including bacteria and modified lipoproteins. The protein's structure is characterized by a short intracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a large extracellular portion that includes a collagenous domain and a scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domain, which is essential for ligand binding and immune signaling (Sankala2002Characterization; Brännström2002Arginine). MARCO is involved in several critical interactions that enhance immune responses, such as with the cytoplasmic DNA sensor cGAS and integrin β5, facilitating processes like phagocytosis and cytokine production (Hirano2023Macrophage; Maler2017Key). Additionally, MARCO's expression in specific macrophage populations and its role in the tumor microenvironment underscore its clinical significance, particularly in the context of cancer immunotherapy (La2021Targeting).

## Structure
The MARCO protein is a type II transmembrane protein primarily expressed in macrophages. It consists of a short N-terminal intracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a large extracellular portion. The extracellular part includes a spacer domain, a long collagenous domain, and a scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domain (Sankala2002Characterization; Brännström2002Arginine). The collagenous domain is characterized by a triple-helical structure, which facilitates the trimerization of the protein, contributing to its quaternary structure (Sankala2002Characterization). 

The SRCR domain is crucial for ligand binding and contains six cysteine residues forming three intrachain disulfide bridges (Sankala2002Characterization). This domain exhibits a compact globular fold with a twisted five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and a single α-helix, stabilized by hydrophobic contacts and disulfide bonds (Ojala2007Crystal). The SRCR domain also features a basic cluster of arginine residues, which is important for ligand recognition (Ojala2007Crystal).

MARCO's structure is distinct from other class A scavenger receptors as it lacks an α-helical coiled-coil domain, instead having a long collagenous domain (Brännström2002Arginine). The protein's structure is further stabilized by post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which may influence its function and stability (Sankala2002Characterization).

## Function
The MARCO gene encodes a macrophage receptor with collagenous structure, which is a class A scavenger receptor primarily expressed on macrophages. In healthy human cells, MARCO plays a crucial role in the innate immune response by binding to and facilitating the uptake of a wide variety of pathogens, including both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as modified lipoproteins like acetylated LDL (Mukhopadhyay2006MARCO; Elomaa1998Structure). The receptor is involved in the recognition and clearance of bacterial infections, particularly in non-opsonic environments, by tethering bacterial ligands to other complexes such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) to initiate an inflammatory response (Novakowski2016A; Thuong2016MARCO).

MARCO contains a C-terminal Scavenger Receptor Cysteine Rich (SRCR) domain, which is critical for its function in ligand binding, promoting downstream signaling, and enhancing cellular adhesion (Novakowski2016A). This domain is essential for the receptor's ability to bind and internalize ligands, as well as for enhancing pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, such as the NF-κB pathway, in response to pathogens like Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Novakowski2016A; Bowdish2009MARCO). MARCO's expression is limited to specific macrophage populations, such as those in the spleen and lymph nodes, suggesting a specialized role in immune response and tissue-specific functions (Elomaa1998Structure).

## Clinical Significance
The MARCO gene, encoding the macrophage receptor with collagenous structure, plays a significant role in the tumor microenvironment, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Alterations in MARCO expression are associated with an immunosuppressive phenotype in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which can inhibit the function of cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, while promoting regulatory T cell proliferation. This immunosuppressive environment contributes to poor prognosis and chemotherapy resistance in NSCLC (La2021Targeting).

MARCO-expressing macrophages are often found in proximity to tumor cell nests and are associated with increased regulatory T cells and decreased NK cells, further contributing to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. This expression pattern is linked to worse clinical outcomes in NSCLC patients (La2021Targeting). Targeting MARCO with monoclonal antibodies or blocking IL37 signaling has been suggested as a therapeutic strategy to repolarize these macrophages towards a proinflammatory phenotype, potentially enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapies by reducing their suppressive capacity on T and NK cells (La2021Targeting).

## Interactions
MARCO, the macrophage receptor with collagenous structure, is involved in several interactions with other proteins that facilitate its role in immune responses. One of the key interactions is with the cytoplasmic DNA sensor cGAS, which enhances innate virus recognition and triggers proinflammatory responses, including the production of interleukin-6 and interferons (Maler2017Key). MARCO also interacts with integrin β5, which is involved in the phagocytosis of tumor cells and the internalization of exosomes (Hirano2023Macrophage). 

The SRCR domain of MARCO is crucial for its interactions, as it enhances NF-κB activity via TLR2/CD14, which is part of the proinflammatory response to pathogens (Novakowski2016A). This domain is also essential for ligand binding and cellular adhesion, as demonstrated by experiments showing that MARCO-expressing cells have increased adhesion and morphological changes compared to cells expressing a variant lacking the SRCR domain (Novakowski2016A). 

MARCO's role in the internalization of adenovirus and subsequent immune responses is also significant, as it facilitates adenovirus transduction and cytokine production in macrophages (Maler2017Key). These interactions highlight MARCO's multifaceted role in mediating immune responses through its interactions with various proteins.
