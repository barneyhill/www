# ZNF641

## Overview
ZNF641 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 641, a member of the KRAB/C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor family. This protein is characterized by its structural components, including a Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain and multiple C2H2 zinc finger motifs, which are integral to its function as a transcriptional regulator. Unlike typical KRAB domain-containing proteins that act as transcriptional repressors, zinc finger protein 641 functions as a transcriptional activator, influencing various cellular pathways, such as the MAPK pathway, by modulating the expression of target genes. The protein is predominantly localized in the nucleus and is expressed in most human tissues, with particularly high levels in skeletal muscle. Its involvement in transcriptional activation and cell signaling underscores its potential role in physiological processes and disease regulation (Qi2006Activation).

## Structure
The ZNF641 gene encodes a protein that is part of the KRAB/C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor family. The protein consists of 438 amino acids with a molecular mass of approximately 49.5 kDa (Qi2006Activation). The primary structure of ZNF641 includes an N-terminal Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, spanning amino acids 109-170, and five C2H2 zinc finger motifs located at amino acids 266-286, 294-316, 322-342, 374-394, and 402-422 (Qi2006Activation). These zinc finger motifs are crucial for DNA binding and transcriptional regulation.

The secondary structure likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of zinc finger proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure is stabilized by the coordination of zinc ions, which is characteristic of C2H2-type zinc finger proteins (Qi2006Activation).

ZNF641 also features a novel transcriptional activation domain known as the linker motif, spanning amino acids 171-265, which enhances transcriptional activity (Qi2006Activation). The KRAB domain, typically associated with transcriptional repression, can activate transcription when fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (Qi2006Activation). The protein is expressed in most human tissues, with high levels in skeletal muscle (Qi2006Activation).

## Function
ZNF641 is a zinc-finger protein that functions as a transcriptional activator in healthy human cells. It is characterized by the presence of a KRAB domain and five C2H2-type zinc fingers, which are typically associated with DNA binding and transcriptional regulation (Qi2006Activation). Despite the KRAB domain's usual role in transcriptional repression, ZNF641 has been shown to activate transcription, particularly enhancing the transcriptional activities of AP-1 and SRE, which are involved in cell signal transduction pathways, such as the MAPK pathway (Qi2006Activation).

The protein is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it influences the transcriptional landscape by modulating the expression of target genes (Qi2006Activation). ZNF641's role as a transcriptional activator suggests its involvement in regulating transcription factors and cell signaling processes, which are crucial for cell survival, adaptation, and proliferation (Qi2006Activation). The protein's activity in the MAPK-mediated signaling pathways indicates its potential role in various physiological processes, including embryonic development and possibly in the regulation of diseases (Qi2006Activation).
