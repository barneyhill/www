# ZDHHC9

## Overview
ZDHHC9 is a gene that encodes the protein zinc finger DHHC-type palmitoyltransferase 9, a member of the DHHC family of palmitoyltransferases. This enzyme is characterized by the presence of a DHHC (Asp-His-His-Cys) catalytic motif, which is essential for its enzymatic activity in the palmitoylation of proteins such as NRAS and HRAS. Palmitoylation is a post-translational modification critical for the proper localization and function of these proteins within cellular membranes, including the plasma membrane and Golgi complex (Raymond2007Mutations; Mitchell2014Mutations). The ZDHHC9 protein contains transmembrane domains and a cytosolic catalytic domain, which are important for its cellular localization and function (Mitchell2014Mutations). It also interacts with the accessory protein GCP16, which is necessary for its stability and activity (Salaun2020Accessory). Mutations in the ZDHHC9 gene have been linked to X-linked intellectual disability and epilepsy, highlighting its significance in neural development and function (Shimell2019The).

## Structure
The ZDHHC9 protein is a member of the DHHC family of palmitoyltransferases, characterized by the presence of a DHHC (Asp-His-His-Cys) catalytic motif, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Mitchell2014Mutations). This protein is involved in the palmitoylation of NRAS and HRAS proteins, a post-translational modification important for protein localization and function (Raymond2007Mutations). The ZDHHC9 protein contains a cysteine-rich domain, which includes the DHHC motif, and is essential for its function in palmitoylation (Mitchell2014Mutations).

The protein structure includes transmembrane domains (TMDs) and a cytosolic catalytic domain, which are important for its function and localization within the cell (Mitchell2014Mutations). The ZDHHC9 protein also requires an accessory protein, GCP16, for its functionality, indicating a potential quaternary structure involving protein-protein interactions (Mitchell2014Mutations). Mutations in the ZDHHC9 gene, such as R148W and P150S, have been shown to affect the autopalmitoylation activity of the protein, impacting its catalytic efficiency and substrate affinity (Mitchell2014Mutations). These mutations are located within a conserved motif, highlighting their importance in the protein's structural and functional integrity (Mitchell2014Mutations).

## Function
ZDHHC9 encodes a palmitoyl acyl-transferase enzyme that plays a crucial role in the palmitoylation of specific proteins, such as the small GTPases Ras and TC10. This post-translational modification is essential for the proper localization and function of these proteins within cellular membranes, particularly the plasma membrane and Golgi complex (Raymond2007Mutations; shimell2019regulation). In neurons, ZDHHC9 is vital for dendritic growth and synapse formation, contributing to the balance of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs, which is crucial for maintaining neural circuit function and preventing conditions like epilepsy (shimell2019regulation).

ZDHHC9's activity influences the spatial and temporal regulation of its substrates, affecting signaling pathways such as ERK and JNK, which are involved in dendritic arborization and synaptic plasticity (poblete2020role; shimell2019regulation). The enzyme is also implicated in the palmitoylation of myelin-associated proteins, impacting myelin sheath formation and white matter development (poblete2020role). ZDHHC9 is active in the Golgi apparatus and other cellular membranes, where it regulates protein trafficking and membrane dynamics, essential for cellular communication and function (shimell2019regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZDHHC9 gene are associated with X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) and epilepsy. Approximately 2% of XLID patients have mutations in this gene, which are linked to increased seizure activity and network excitability due to altered excitatory-to-inhibitory synapse ratios (Shimell2019The). These mutations can lead to shorter dendritic arbors and increased synaptic excitability, contributing to the neural circuit abnormalities observed in affected individuals (Shimell2019The).

Specific mutations, such as R148W and P150S, decrease the enzymatic activity of ZDHHC9, affecting dendritic growth and synapse formation, which are critical for cognitive function (Shimell2019The; Mitchell2014Mutations). These mutations have also been linked to Marfanoid features, including developmental delays and distinct physical characteristics, although they do not meet the full criteria for Marfan syndrome (Raymond2007Mutations).

Alterations in ZDHHC9 expression can disrupt the balance between excitatory and inhibitory synapses, leading to conditions such as epilepsy and intellectual disabilities (Shimell2019The; Hollman2023The). The gene's role in myelination and oligodendrocyte subtype determination further implicates it in neurological disorders, as dysmyelination can affect seizure activity (Hollman2023The).

## Interactions
ZDHHC9 interacts with several proteins, forming complexes that are crucial for its function as a palmitoyltransferase. One significant interaction is with GCP16 (Golgin subfamily A member 7), which is essential for the stability and S-acylation activity of ZDHHC9. This interaction is analogous to the yeast Erf2-Erf4 complex, where GCP16 stabilizes ZDHHC9 and prevents its degradation. In the absence of GCP16, ZDHHC9 undergoes partial proteolysis and loses its ability to S-acylate substrates like H-Ras (Greaves2011DHHC; Salaun2020Accessory).

ZDHHC9 also interacts with small GTPases such as N-Ras and TC10, mediating their palmitoylation, which is crucial for their membrane localization and function. This palmitoylation process is vital for promoting dendritic outgrowth and inhibitory synapse formation, affecting neural circuit formation and synaptic balance (shimell2019regulation).

Additionally, ZDHHC9 is involved in the palmitoylation of proteins related to myelin sheath formation, such as PLP and MOG, in oligodendrocytes. This interaction is important for the targeting of these proteins to lipid raft microdomains, which is essential for proper myelin sheath formation (poblete2020role).
