# C2orf72

## Overview
C2orf72 is a gene located on chromosome 2 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 2 open reading frame 72. This protein is categorized as a hypothetical protein due to the limited understanding of its specific biological functions and interactions. While the precise role of C2orf72 in cellular processes remains to be fully elucidated, it is hypothesized to be involved in various cellular pathways based on its expression patterns and potential interactions with other proteins. Further research is necessary to determine its exact function and any implications it may have in human health and disease.
