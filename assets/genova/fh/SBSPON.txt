# SBSPON

## Overview
SBSPON is a gene that encodes the somatomedin B and thrombospondin type 1 domain containing protein, which is involved in the structural organization of the extracellular matrix. This protein is categorized as an extracellular matrix protein and plays a significant role in cellular processes such as adhesion and migration. It has been implicated in various pathological contexts, including tumor biology, where it is associated with the radiological location of meningiomas and is involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and collagen biosynthesis pathways (Mukherjee2021Comprehensive). Additionally, SBSPON is targeted by long noncoding RNAs in gastric cancer, suggesting its potential role in modulating cellular signaling pathways and influencing cancer progression (Zeng2022A).

## Interactions
SBSPON, also known as somatomedin B and thrombospondin type 1 domain containing protein, is implicated in various protein interactions, particularly in the context of tumor biology and extracellular matrix organization. In the study of meningiomas, SBSPON was identified as part of a specific protein signature associated with the radiological location of tumors, indicating its potential role in tumor pathobiology (Mukherjee2021Comprehensive). The study highlighted that SBSPON, along with other proteins like FBLN5 and NUP210, was more abundant in supratentorial meningiomas, suggesting its involvement in the extracellular matrix remodeling and collagen biosynthesis pathways (Mukherjee2021Comprehensive).

In gastric cancer, SBSPON is targeted by the long noncoding RNA AC005165.1, and its expression is found to be low in gastric cancer tissues. This suggests that SBSPON may act as a structural component of the extracellular matrix, potentially influencing cellular processes such as adhesion and migration (Zeng2022A). Although specific protein interactions involving SBSPON were not detailed, its association with extracellular matrix components implies its participation in multiprotein complexes that modulate cellular signaling pathways (Zeng2022A).
