# PEG10

## Overview
PEG10 (Paternally Expressed 10) is a gene derived from a retrotransposon, encoding a protein that plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis regulation. The PEG10 protein is characterized by structural features reminiscent of retroviral proteins, such as a GAG-like protein and a GAG-POL-like fusion protein, produced through a -1 ribosomal frameshift mechanism. This protein is involved in essential cellular functions and is highly expressed in the placenta, where it contributes to placental development and fetal-maternal nutrient exchange. PEG10's interactions with other proteins and its regulation of vesicle fusion underscore its significance in cellular processes and development. Additionally, aberrant expression of PEG10 is implicated in several cancers, where it functions as an oncogene, promoting tumor growth and inhibiting apoptosis (Shiura2023Roles; Lux2010Genetic; Abed2019The).

## Structure
The PEG10 protein is derived from a retrotransposon and exhibits structural features reminiscent of retroviral proteins. It contains two open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1 and ORF2, which overlap and are translated into a GAG-like protein and a GAG-POL-like fusion protein through a -1 ribosomal frameshift mechanism (Shiura2023Roles; Lux2010Genetic). The primary structure includes a coiled-coil domain and a zinc finger domain in the PEG10-RF1 protein, typical of retroviral Gag proteins (Lux2010Genetic). The C-terminal domain (CTD) of PEG10 consists of five α-helices forming a tertiary structure similar to the CA-CTDs of retroviruses like HIV-1, although it lacks certain conserved residues, leading to a divergent backbone configuration (Zurowska2021Structural).

PEG10 can form dimers in crystal lattice packing, akin to the dimerization observed in HIV-1 CA-CTD (Zurowska2021Structural). The protein also includes a CCHC RNA-binding domain and a DSG viral aspartic protease motif, which are crucial for its function (Shiura2021PEG10). PEG10 undergoes post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination, and has multiple splice variant isoforms, contributing to its functional diversity (Lux2010Genetic; Abed2019The). These structural features underscore PEG10's role as a domesticated Gag protein with preserved characteristics essential for its biological functions (Zurowska2021Structural).

## Function
PEG10 (Paternally Expressed 10) is a retrotransposon-derived gene that plays a significant role in various cellular and developmental processes. In healthy human cells, PEG10 is involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis regulation. It is highly expressed in the placenta, where it is crucial for placental development and the maintenance of fetal capillaries, facilitating nutrient and gas exchange between fetal and maternal blood (Shiura2023Roles; Clark2007Mammalian).

PEG10 encodes proteins through a unique -1 ribosomal frameshift mechanism, a process also observed in retroviruses, allowing the production of multiple proteins from the same mRNA. These proteins include PEG10-RF1 and PEG10-RF1/2, which are involved in inhibiting apoptosis and promoting cell proliferation (Clark2007Mammalian; Lux2010Genetic). The gene's expression is noted in various tissues, including the brain, lung, testis, and placenta, indicating its role in normal cellular functions and embryonic development (Ono2001A).

PEG10's molecular activities include interactions with proteins involved in vesicle fusion, such as VTI1B and STX8, which may regulate the budding of PEG10-containing vesicles, essential for trophoblast stem cell differentiation (Abed2019The). The gene's expression and function are tightly regulated, with implications in both normal development and potential pathological conditions.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PEG10 gene are implicated in various cancers. PEG10 acts as an oncogene, promoting tumor proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis, which are critical processes in cancer progression. Overexpression of PEG10 is associated with increased cancer cell proliferation in hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and gastric cancer. Knockdown of PEG10 results in reduced tumor growth and increased apoptosis, highlighting its role in cancer progression (Xie2018PEG10).

In neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), PEG10 is identified as a significant driver and potential therapeutic target. It promotes the invasive and proliferative phenotype of NEPC cells, particularly when unchecked by TP53 and RB1 pathways. PEG10 expression is dynamically regulated by the androgen receptor and the E2F/RB pathway, contributing to NEPC progression (Akamatsu2015The).

In high-risk B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), PEG10 overexpression is linked to poor-risk features and disease progression. It is associated with high LPL expression and shorter time to first treatment. PEG10 expression remains stable over time, even after chemotherapy, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker in B-CLL (Kainz2007Overexpression).

In endometrial cancer, PEG10 is highly expressed and directly related to patient survival. It inhibits the expression of cell cycle-regulating genes, promoting cancer progression (Zhang2021IGF2BP1).

## Interactions
PEG10, a retrotransposon-derived gene, engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing significant roles in cellular processes. One notable interaction is with the RTL8 protein, which antagonizes PEG10-mediated virus-like particles (VLPs). RTL8 binds specifically to the N-terminal domain of the PEG10 capsid, incorporating into PEG10-derived VLPs and reducing their abundance. This interaction suggests a regulatory mechanism where RTL8 modulates the release and formation of PEG10-derived VLPs (Campodonico2023The).

PEG10 also interacts with the transforming growth factor-β receptor activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1). This interaction involves the PEG10-RF1 protein, which binds to ALK1, potentially influencing the TGF-β signaling pathway. The interaction region, termed PAIR1, is localized to a 200-amino acid segment necessary for proper binding (Lux2005Human).

In addition, PEG10 is a substrate for the deubiquitinating enzyme USP9X in mouse embryonic stem cells. This interaction stabilizes PEG10 by reducing its ubiquitination, thereby preventing its proteasomal degradation (Abed2019The). These interactions highlight PEG10's multifaceted role in cellular regulation and its potential implications in disease contexts.
