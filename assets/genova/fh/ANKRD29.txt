# ANKRD29

## Overview
ANKRD29, or ankyrin repeat domain 29, is a gene that encodes a protein characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat motifs, which are known for their role in mediating protein-protein interactions. These interactions are essential for various cellular processes, including transcription initiation, cell cycle regulation, and cytoskeleton maintenance (Chakrabarty2022Sequence). The protein encoded by ANKRD29 is involved in maintaining the structural integrity of the annulus fibrosus compartment of the intervertebral disc, indicating its importance in cellular structure and function (Fernandes2020Singlecell). In addition to its structural roles, ANKRD29 has been identified as a significant prognostic and immunological biomarker in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where its expression levels are associated with tumor progression and patient survival (Zhao2023ANKRD29). The gene's involvement in both normal cellular functions and disease states underscores its potential as a therapeutic target and a biomarker for cancer prognosis and treatment response (Zhao2023ANKRD29).

## Function
ANKRD29, or ankyrin repeat domain 29, encodes a protein characterized by ankyrin repeat motifs, which are structural motifs known for facilitating protein-protein interactions. These interactions are crucial for various cellular processes, including transcription initiation, cell cycle regulation, and cytoskeleton maintenance (Chakrabarty2022Sequence). In healthy human cells, ANKRD29 is involved in maintaining the structural integrity of the annulus fibrosus (AF) compartment of the intervertebral disc, suggesting its role in cellular structure and function (Fernandes2020Singlecell).

The ankyrin repeat domains in ANKRD29 contribute to its involvement in protein stability and interactions, which are essential for its function in cellular processes (Chakrabarty2022Sequence). The protein's structure, including conserved residues, supports its stability and ability to interact with various ligands, indicating its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Chakrabarty2022Sequence).

While specific molecular processes or cellular roles of ANKRD29 in healthy human cells are not detailed extensively, its involvement in protein-protein interactions and structural maintenance suggests it plays a significant role in normal cellular function and organization (Chakrabarty2022Sequence).

## Clinical Significance
ANKRD29 has been identified as a significant prognostic and immunological biomarker in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Alterations in the expression of ANKRD29, particularly its downregulation due to promoter hypermethylation, are associated with the progression of NSCLC. The gene's low expression levels in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues correlate with shorter overall survival in patients, indicating its potential role as a tumor suppressor (Zhao2023ANKRD29). Overexpression of ANKRD29 in NSCLC cell lines has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation, induce cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, and reduce cell migration, suggesting its involvement in controlling tumor growth and spread (Zhao2023ANKRD29).

ANKRD29 also plays a role in the tumor microenvironment and immune response. Its expression is negatively correlated with immune cell infiltration levels, and it can predict the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockers in NSCLC. High ANKRD29 expression is linked to better responses to therapies such as anti-PD-1, anti-CTLA-4, and anti-PD-L1, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhao2023ANKRD29). These findings underscore the clinical significance of ANKRD29 in NSCLC, both as a prognostic marker and a potential therapeutic target.
