# TUBB2B

## Overview
The TUBB2B gene encodes the tubulin beta 2B class IIb protein, a critical component of the tubulin family involved in the formation of microtubules. These microtubules are essential for various cellular processes, including cell division, intracellular transport, and maintaining cell shape. The TUBB2B protein plays a significant role in the nervous system, particularly in neuronal migration and brain development, by contributing to the structural integrity of neurons. Mutations in the TUBB2B gene can lead to neurological disorders, such as polymicrogyria and lissencephaly, due to disrupted microtubule dynamics and impaired neuronal migration (Jaglin2009Mutations; Guerrini2012Symmetric). Additionally, TUBB2B has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma, where it influences cholesterol metabolism and tumor progression (Wang2023TUBB2B).

## Function
The TUBB2B gene encodes a β-tubulin protein that is a critical component of microtubules, which are essential for various cellular processes, including cell division, intracellular transport, and maintenance of cell shape (Jaglin2009Mutations). In healthy human cells, TUBB2B is expressed in several key areas of the nervous system, such as the cortex, cerebellum, brainstem, spinal cord, retina, and peripheral nervous system, playing a significant role in the proper assembly and function of microtubules (Jaglin2009Mutations).

Microtubules, composed of α- and β-tubulin heterodimers, are dynamic structures that provide mechanical support and facilitate cellular processes like mitosis and intracellular trafficking (Cushion2013Overlapping). TUBB2B is involved in maintaining the structural integrity of neurons, influencing neuronal migration and the structural integrity of the brain (Jaglin2009Mutations). The protein's role in microtubule-dependent processes includes the recycling or intracellular trafficking of transmembrane receptors, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the basement membrane and proper cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions (Jaglin2009Mutations).

Mutations in TUBB2B can disrupt these processes, leading to neurological disorders such as polymicrogyria, characterized by abnormal brain development due to impaired neuronal migration (Jaglin2009Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TUBB2B gene are associated with a range of brain malformations, collectively known as tubulinopathies. These include polymicrogyria, a condition characterized by an excessive number of small gyri and an irregular cortical surface, often linked to abnormal neuronal development (Guerrini2012Symmetric). TUBB2B mutations can also lead to lissencephaly, where the brain surface appears smooth due to abnormal neuronal migration, and pachygyria, which involves thickened cortical regions (Romaniello2015Mutations; Guerrini2012Symmetric). 

Patients with TUBB2B mutations may exhibit a variety of neurological symptoms, including developmental delays, epilepsy, and intellectual disabilities. Epilepsy is present in approximately 49% of cases, with focal seizures being the most common type (Romaniello2019Epilepsy). Structural brain abnormalities such as dysmorphic basal ganglia and cerebellar anomalies are also observed (Dekker2021A). 

In addition to neurological disorders, TUBB2B has been implicated in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Alterations in TUBB2B expression can influence cholesterol metabolism, promoting tumor progression and serving as an independent prognostic factor for shorter overall survival in HCC patients (Wang2023TUBB2B).

## Interactions
TUBB2B, a tubulin beta-2B chain, is involved in various protein-protein interactions crucial for its role in microtubule dynamics and cellular functions. It interacts with other tubulin family proteins, such as TUBB2B itself, in the formation of microtubule structures, which are essential for cellular processes like microtubule nucleation and dynamics (Ramesh2023Prediction). 

Mutations in TUBB2B, such as F265L and S172P, have been shown to disrupt its interaction with folding intermediates like TBCA and TBCD, leading to defects in heterodimer assembly and microtubule dynamics (Jaglin2009Mutations). These mutations affect the protein's ability to form stable complexes, impacting microtubule regrowth and dynamics (Jaglin2009Mutations).

In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma, TUBB2B interacts with CYP27A1, influencing cholesterol metabolism and tumor progression. TUBB2B expression modulates the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) pathway, affecting cell proliferation and apoptosis (Wang2023TUBB2B). These interactions highlight TUBB2B's role in both structural cellular functions and disease processes.
