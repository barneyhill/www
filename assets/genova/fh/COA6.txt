# COA6

## Overview
The COA6 gene encodes the cytochrome c oxidase assembly factor 6, a mitochondrial protein that plays a pivotal role in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), also known as complex IV of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This protein functions as a thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase and is involved in the copper delivery pathway essential for the proper assembly and enzymatic activity of CcO. Located in the intermembrane space of mitochondria, COA6 interacts with other mitochondrial proteins, such as SCO1 and SCO2, to facilitate the incorporation of copper into the COX2 subunit of CcO. Mutations in the COA6 gene can lead to severe mitochondrial disorders, including fatal infantile cardioencephalomyopathy, highlighting its critical role in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production (Ghosh2014Copper; Ghezzi2018Human; Soma2019COA6).

## Structure
The COA6 protein is characterized by a coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix (CHCH) domain, which is a specific secondary structure important for its function as a thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase in the copper delivery pathway to cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) (Soma2019COA6). The solution structure of human COA6 isoform 3, determined using NMR spectroscopy, reveals that COA6 predominantly exists as an 18-kDa dimer. The dimerization is not affected by reducing agents, indicating it is not due to inter-disulfide bonding (Soma2019COA6). The core region of COA6 (residues 9-64) is entirely helical, composed of four helices, with the first two helices stabilized by a pair of disulfide bonds (Soma2019COA6).

COA6 interacts with SCO1 through a largely non-polar interface, involving hydrophobic interactions, particularly in helix 3 and a beta-hairpin turn, which are crucial for its interaction with SCO1 (Soma2019COA6). The protein is not a copper-binding protein under physiological conditions, and its enzymatic activity is independent of its metalation state (Soma2019COA6). The presence of a CHCH domain suggests a role in redox chemistry, and mutations in COA6, such as W59C, E87X, and W66R, have been linked to mitochondrial diseases (Soma2019COA6).

## Function
The COA6 gene encodes a mitochondrial protein that plays a crucial role in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), also known as complex IV, which is a vital component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This protein is located in the intermembrane space of mitochondria and is involved in the delivery of copper to CcO subunits, a process essential for the proper assembly and function of the enzyme complex (Ghosh2014Copper; Baertling2014Mutations). COA6 contains a conserved cysteine-rich motif, which is important for its function in copper metabolism and the stabilization of complex IV subunits (TimónGómez2018Mitochondrial; Ghosh2014Copper).

In healthy human cells, COA6 is essential for maintaining the levels of CcO subunits, particularly COX2, and ensuring efficient cellular respiration and ATP production (Ghosh2014Copper; Baertling2014Mutations). The protein's role in copper delivery is critical, as copper is a cofactor necessary for the enzymatic activity of CcO. Mutations in COA6 can lead to deficiencies in complex IV, resulting in severe clinical phenotypes such as neonatal hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Baertling2014Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the COA6 gene are associated with severe mitochondrial disorders, most notably fatal infantile cardioencephalomyopathy. This condition is characterized by early onset and primarily affects the heart and brain, leading to significant health challenges in infancy (Ghezzi2018Human). The COA6 protein plays a crucial role in the assembly and function of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, particularly in copper binding and interaction with other mitochondrial proteins, such as SCO1 and MTCO2. Disruptions in these interactions due to COA6 mutations can impair the proper assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (Complex IV), a critical component of the electron transport chain (Ghezzi2018Human; Alston2016The).

The clinical manifestations of COA6 mutations are severe, often leading to early onset conditions that predominantly affect the heart and central nervous system. These include symptoms similar to those seen in other mitochondrial disorders, such as Leigh syndrome, which is characterized by progressive neurological deterioration (Alston2016The). The involvement of COA6 in copper-dependent COX2 biogenesis further underscores its importance in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production (Alston2016The).

## Interactions
The COA6 protein is involved in several critical interactions within the mitochondria, primarily related to the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO). COA6 interacts with SCO1 and SCO2, which are copper metallochaperones involved in the biogenesis of the COX2 subunit of CcO. COA6 forms a complex with SCO1, with a preference for SCO1 over SCO2, as demonstrated by competitive binding analysis and size-exclusion chromatography (Soma2019COA6). The interaction with SCO1 involves a largely non-polar interface, with specific non-polar residues on COA6 and SCO1 facilitating this interaction (Soma2019COA6).

COA6 also interacts with COX2, a subunit of CcO, and is necessary for its maturation. This interaction is transient and occurs early after COX2 synthesis, highlighting COA6's role in the copper delivery pathway to the CuA site of COX2 (PacheuGrau2015Cooperation). COA6 can form a ternary complex with SCO2 and COX2, which is crucial for copper incorporation into COX2 (PacheuGrau2015Cooperation). The interaction between COA6 and SCO2 is facilitated by cysteine residues in the CX3CXnH motif of SCO2, which are essential for binding (PacheuGrau2020COA6). These interactions underscore COA6's role as a thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase in the mitochondrial copper delivery pathway.
