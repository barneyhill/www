# ALOX5AP

## Overview
ALOX5AP, or arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase activating protein, is a gene that encodes a crucial scaffold protein involved in the biosynthesis of leukotrienes, which are lipid mediators that play significant roles in inflammatory and immune responses. The protein encoded by ALOX5AP, also known as 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP), facilitates the activation of 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5), a key enzyme in the conversion of arachidonic acid to leukotriene A4, an intermediate in the leukotriene biosynthetic pathway (Rådmark20155Lipoxygenase; Elias2016ALOX5AP). ALOX5AP is primarily active in leukocytes, where it forms a multiprotein complex that is essential for the efficient production of leukotrienes, influencing processes such as inflammation and allergic reactions (Haeggström2011Lipoxygenase). Variations in the ALOX5AP gene have been linked to several cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its clinical significance in conditions characterized by dysregulated inflammatory responses (Helgadottir2004The; Manev20065Lipoxygenase).

## Structure


## Function
ALOX5AP, or arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase activating protein, plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of leukotrienes, which are lipid mediators involved in inflammatory and immune responses. ALOX5AP functions by activating 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), facilitating the conversion of arachidonic acid into leukotriene A4 (LTA4), an unstable intermediate that can be further transformed into leukotriene B4 (LTB4) or lipoxin A4 (LXA4) (Rådmark20155Lipoxygenase; Elias2016ALOX5AP). 

In healthy human cells, ALOX5AP is primarily active in the cytoplasm of leukocytes, where it influences processes such as inflammation and allergic reactions. It acts as a scaffold protein for 5-LOX, ensuring the efficient conversion of arachidonic acid by forming complexes with other proteins and facilitating membrane trafficking and signaling (Rådmark20155Lipoxygenase). 

ALOX5AP is also involved in the production of eicosanoids, specifically leukotrienes like LTB4 and lipoxins like LXA4. While LTB4 is a proinflammatory molecule, LXA4 serves as an anti-inflammatory mediator, playing a role in the resolution of inflammation (Elias2016ALOX5AP). The balance between these molecules is crucial for maintaining normal inflammatory responses and preventing chronic inflammation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and variations in the ALOX5AP gene have been associated with several cardiovascular diseases, including myocardial infarction and stroke. A specific four-marker single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) haplotype in the ALOX5AP gene is linked to a twofold increased risk of these conditions in Icelandic individuals, with similar associations observed in different haplotypes among UK populations (Helgadottir2004The). The gene's involvement in the leukotriene biosynthetic pathway suggests that its variants may contribute to the pathogenesis of these diseases by increasing leukotriene production and inflammation in the arterial wall (Helgadottir2004The).

In European populations, the SG13S114 polymorphism in ALOX5AP is associated with a decreased risk of ischemic stroke, indicating a protective effect of certain alleles (Chen2017The). However, other studies have shown that different haplotypes, such as HapA and HapB, are associated with increased risks of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction, highlighting the gene's role in atherosclerosis and inflammation (Girelli2007ALOX5AP; Huang2010Variants).

The gene has also been implicated in Alzheimer's disease, with suggestions that ALOX5AP polymorphisms might contribute to the disease's pathology through their role in cerebrovascular disease (Manev20065Lipoxygenase).

## Interactions
ALOX5AP, also known as the 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP), plays a crucial role in leukotriene biosynthesis by interacting with 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5). This interaction is essential for the conversion of arachidonic acid to leukotriene A4, a precursor for other leukotrienes involved in inflammatory responses. ALOX5AP acts as a scaffold protein, facilitating the translocation and activation of ALOX5 in response to calcium ions. It helps localize ALOX5 to the nuclear membrane, forming a multiprotein biosynthetic complex that includes membrane-bound LTC4 synthase, which is involved in localized cysteinyl leukotriene synthesis (Nunns2018Trauma; Haeggström2011Lipoxygenase).

The interaction between ALOX5 and ALOX5AP is enhanced following trauma and hemorrhagic shock, as demonstrated by increased co-localization in the cytoplasmic, perinuclear, and nuclear domains. This association is crucial for post-traumatic lung damage, and its disruption by the inhibitor MK-886 reduces lung injury (Nunns2018Trauma). ALOX5AP does not possess enzymatic activity but serves as an arachidonate binding protein, potentially presenting or transferring arachidonic acid to ALOX5 (Haeggström2011Lipoxygenase). The crystal structure of FLAP reveals it forms a homotrimer, with an inhibitor binding site overlapping the arachidonic acid binding site, facilitating its role in leukotriene biosynthesis (Haeggström2011Lipoxygenase).
