# MMP21

## Overview
Matrix metallopeptidase 21 (MMP21) is a gene that encodes the protein matrix metallopeptidase 21, a member of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family. This family of proteins is known for its role in the degradation of extracellular matrix components, which is crucial for various physiological processes such as tissue remodeling, embryogenesis, and wound healing. MMP21 is a secreted enzyme characterized by a modular domain structure, including a catalytic domain with a zinc-binding motif and a hemopexin-like domain, which are typical features of MMPs (Ahokas2003Matrix; MARCHENKO2003The). Unlike some other MMPs, MMP21 lacks a transmembrane domain, indicating its function as a soluble enzyme (Ahokas2003Matrix). The expression of MMP21 is regulated by pathways such as Wnt and NF-κB, and it plays a significant role in developmental processes and disease states, including cancer and congenital heart defects (Nakai2023Wnt; MARCHENKO2003The).

## Structure
Matrix metallopeptidase 21 (MMP-21) is a secreted protein with a molecular mass of approximately 57 kDa. It is characterized by a modular domain structure typical of matrix metalloproteinases, including a signal sequence, a prodomain, a catalytic domain, and a hemopexin-like domain (Ahokas2003Matrix; MARCHENKO2003The). The prodomain contains a conserved cysteine-switch motif (PRCGVPD), which is crucial for maintaining the enzyme in its latent form by binding to the catalytic zinc atom (Ahokas2002Matrix; MARCHENKO2003The). The catalytic domain features a zinc-binding motif (HEIGHVLGL) essential for its enzymatic activity (Ahokas2002Matrix; Ahokas2003Matrix).

MMP-21 lacks a transmembrane sequence and cytoplasmic domain, distinguishing it from membrane-type MMPs (Ahokas2003Matrix; MARCHENKO2003The). It includes a furin activation sequence, indicating that it can be activated by furin-like proprotein convertases (Ahokas2002Matrix; MARCHENKO2003The). The protein is not classified as a gelatinase, collagenase, or stromelysin due to the absence of specific motifs characteristic of these groups (Ahokas2002Matrix).

MMP-21 is expressed in various human tissues and cancer cell lines, with several splice variants identified, although their functional significance remains unclear (Ahokas2002Matrix).

## Function
Matrix metallopeptidase 21 (MMP21) is a member of the matrix metalloproteinase family, which is involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix components. MMP21 is synthesized as a latent proenzyme and is secreted due to a hydrophobic signal peptide. It is activated by furin and related proprotein convertases in the secretory pathway (Ahokas2002Matrix; MARCHENKO2003The). The enzyme contains a catalytic domain with a zinc-binding sequence typical of MMPs and a haemopexin-like C-terminal domain (MARCHENKO2003The).

MMP21 is expressed during fetal development, particularly in the liver and brain, and at low levels in adult tissues such as the kidney, brain, lung, testis, ovary, colon, and leukocytes (Ahokas2002Matrix). It plays a role in tissue remodeling and embryogenesis, with specific functions in neuronal cell development (MARCHENKO2003The). The expression of MMP21 is regulated by the Wnt pathway and controlled by transcription factors such as Pax and Notch, which are critical for organogenesis (MARCHENKO2003The).

MMP21's activity can be modulated by specific inhibitors, and it has been shown to cleave α1-anti-trypsin, although with low efficiency (MARCHENKO2003The). The enzyme's low expression levels in various cell lines suggest it may have a specialized or context-dependent function in healthy human cells (MARCHENKO2003The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MMP21 gene have been implicated in several congenital disorders, particularly those affecting cardiac development and organ positioning. De novo heterozygous variants of MMP21, such as p.G244E, p.L277F, and p.K487E, have been identified in patients with heterotaxy (HTX) and complex congenital heart defects (CHDs). These mutations are suggested to disrupt normal cardiac development and left-right patterning during embryogenesis, potentially acting as dominant negatives (Qin2022De). Zebrafish models have demonstrated that certain MMP21 variants, specifically MMP21-G244E and MMP21-K487E, fail to rescue heart looping defects, indicating their pathogenic role in HTX (Qin2022De).

Alterations in MMP21 expression have also been associated with cancer progression. In colorectal cancer (CRC), MMP21 is overexpressed and correlates with tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis, and shorter overall survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and target for therapy (Pezeshkian2021Insights). Additionally, MMP21 may play a role in fibrotic diseases like systemic sclerosis (SSc), where its expression is influenced by TGF-β and potentially regulated by miR-4484, contributing to collagen deposition and microvascular injury (Rusek2019A).

## Interactions
MMP21, a member of the matrix metalloproteinase family, is involved in various interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. It is known to degrade components of the extracellular matrix, such as collagen type I, type IV, and fibronectin, which facilitates cell invasion and metastasis (Nakai2023Wnt). MMP21 is regulated by NF-κB signaling, which directly influences its transcription. The binding of the p65 subunit of NF-κB to the MMP21 promoter is a key interaction that elevates MMP21 expression, promoting the invasive behavior of transformed cells (Nakai2023Wnt).

MMP21 also interacts with the Wnt signaling pathway. The co-expression of LEF-1 and β-catenin-S33Y enhances MMP21 transcriptional activity, suggesting that MMP21 may be a direct target of β-catenin transactivation (MARCHENKO2003The). This interaction highlights the role of MMP21 in the regulation of cell competition and invasion in a Wnt-activated environment.

In the context of embryonic development, MMP21 interacts with tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), which regulate its enzymatic activity. Variants of MMP21 may alter its interaction with TIMPs, affecting its role in tissue remodeling and development (Qin2022De).
