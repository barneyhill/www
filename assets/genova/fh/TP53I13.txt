# TP53I13

## Overview
TP53I13 is a gene that encodes the tumor protein p53 inducible protein 13, which is involved in various cellular processes, including tumor progression and immune response modulation. This protein is categorized as a regulatory protein due to its role in influencing signaling pathways such as p53, MAPK, and WNT, which are critical in cancer pathogenesis (Ge2022TP53I13). The expression of TP53I13 is notably upregulated in certain cancers, such as gliomas, where it is associated with poor prognosis and aggressive tumor characteristics (Ge2022TP53I13). Additionally, TP53I13 has been implicated in the development of carotid body tumors and paragangliomas, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology (Snezhkina2018Exome).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
TP53I13, also known as tumor protein p53 inducible protein 13, has been implicated in the progression and prognosis of gliomas, a type of brain tumor. High expression levels of TP53I13 are associated with poor survival outcomes in glioma patients, indicating its potential role in tumor progression. This gene is overexpressed in glioma tissues compared to normal tissues and is linked to higher tumor grades and IDH wild-type status, which are markers of more aggressive gliomas (Ge2022TP53I13). TP53I13 expression is also correlated with immune cell infiltration, particularly macrophages and neutrophils, which contribute to tumor metastasis and poor survival outcomes (Ge2022TP53I13).

In addition to gliomas, TP53I13 has been identified as a potentially causative gene in carotid body tumors (CBTs) and paragangliomas (PGLs). Mutations in TP53I13, such as the somatic missense mutation NM_138349: c.148C > G, p.(Pro50Ala), have been observed, although specific diseases directly associated with these mutations are not detailed (Snezhkina2018Exome). The gene's involvement in various signaling pathways, including the p53, MAPK, and WNT pathways, underscores its significance in cancer pathogenesis and its potential as a therapeutic target (Ge2022TP53I13).
