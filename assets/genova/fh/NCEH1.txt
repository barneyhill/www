# NCEH1

## Overview
NCEH1 (neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase 1) is a gene that encodes a type II membrane protein involved in cholesterol metabolism. The protein, also referred to as neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase 1, is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plays a pivotal role in hydrolyzing cholesterol esters into free cholesterol and fatty acids. This enzymatic activity is crucial for maintaining cellular cholesterol homeostasis and facilitating reverse cholesterol transport, thereby preventing cholesterol accumulation and atherosclerosis (Sekiya2009Ablation; Zhang2017NCEH1). NCEH1 is particularly significant in macrophages, where it contributes to cholesterol efflux and reduces foam cell formation, a key process in atherosclerosis development (Sekiya2009Ablation). Additionally, NCEH1 interacts with various proteins and is regulated by factors such as the retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor α (RORα), influencing its expression and function in lipid metabolism and endothelial health (Matsuoka2020Retinoic; Sun2024Deficiency). The gene's role extends to neuroprotection, where it helps mitigate mitochondrial stress and neurodegenerative processes (Zhang2017NCEH1).

## Structure
Neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase 1 (NCEH1) is a type II membrane protein that spans the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane with a single transmembrane domain. The protein is anchored to the ER membrane via an N-terminal hydrophobic segment, which acts as a signal anchor sequence crucial for its ER targeting and stability (Igarashi2010Targeting). The catalytic and lipid-binding domains of NCEH1 are located in the ER lumen, facilitating its role in cholesterol metabolism (Igarashi2010Targeting).

NCEH1 contains three N-linked glycosylation sites at Asn 270, Asn 367, and Asn 389, with glycosylation at Asn 270 being particularly critical for its enzymatic activity (Igarashi2010Targeting). These glycosylation sites are important for the protein's function and stability, as demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis studies (Igarashi2010Targeting). The protein's structure includes a catalytic motif similar to that of hormone-sensitive lipase, featuring a His-Gly dipeptide motif and a GX-SXG active serine motif, which are essential for its enzymatic function (Igarashi2010Targeting).

NCEH1 is not phosphorylated under conditions where protein kinase A (PKA) is activated, distinguishing it from hormone-sensitive lipase (Igarashi2010Targeting). The protein's structure and post-translational modifications are integral to its role in hydrolyzing cholesterol esters within the ER.

## Function
NCEH1 (neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase 1) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in cholesterol metabolism by hydrolyzing cholesterol esters into free cholesterol and fatty acids. This process is essential for maintaining cellular cholesterol homeostasis and is a key step in reverse cholesterol transport, which is crucial for preventing cholesterol accumulation and atherosclerosis (Sekiya2009Ablation; Zhang2017NCEH1). NCEH1 is predominantly active in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it is involved in the hydrolysis of intracellular cholesterol esters within cytosolic lipid droplets (Igarashi2010Targeting; Quiroga2011Role).

In macrophages, NCEH1 is a major enzyme responsible for neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase activity, contributing significantly to cholesterol efflux and reducing foam cell formation, which is a key process in the development of atherosclerosis (Sekiya2009Ablation). The enzyme's activity is crucial for mobilizing cholesterol from lipid droplets to the plasma membrane, where it is further processed by ABC transporters like ABCA1 and ABCG1 (Sekiya2009Ablation). NCEH1's function in cholesterol metabolism is also linked to its protective role in neurons, as it helps mitigate mitochondrial stress and neurodegenerative processes (Zhang2017NCEH1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the NCEH1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. NCEH1 plays a crucial role in endothelial function by modulating the interaction between caveolin-1 (Cav-1) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), which is essential for nitric oxide (NO) production and vasodilation. Deficiency in NCEH1 leads to increased Cav-1 expression and reduced eNOS activity, resulting in impaired endothelial function and reduced NO bioavailability. This dysfunction is particularly evident in conditions such as obesity and diabetes, where NCEH1 deficiency exacerbates vascular complications (Sun2024Deficiency).

In the context of atherosclerosis, NCEH1 is involved in the hydrolysis of cholesterol esters in macrophages, a critical step in preventing foam cell formation. Genetic ablation of NCEH1 in mice promotes foam cell formation and accelerates atherosclerosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for this condition (Sekiya2009Ablation).

NCEH1 also has implications in neurodegenerative diseases. In a C. elegans model of Parkinson's disease, NCEH1 modulates cholesterol metabolism and provides neuroprotection against α-synuclein toxicity. Alterations in NCEH1 expression or function can lead to increased cholesterol levels and enhanced neurodegeneration, suggesting its role in maintaining neuronal health (Zhang2017NCEH1).

## Interactions
Neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase 1 (NCEH1) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cholesterol metabolism and endothelial function. NCEH1 interacts with zinc and ring finger 1 (ZNRF1), an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, to promote the ubiquitination and degradation of caveolin-1 (Cav-1) in endothelial cells. This interaction is essential for the regulation of endothelial function, particularly under high glucose conditions, which are relevant to diabetes (Sun2024Deficiency). The interaction between NCEH1 and ZNRF1 facilitates the disruption of the Cav-1/eNOS complex, leading to the activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and increased nitric oxide (NO) production, which is vital for endothelial function (Sun2024Deficiency).

NCEH1 is also a direct target of the retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor α (RORα). RORα binds to specific response elements in the promoter region of the NCEH1 gene, enhancing its transcription. This regulation is significant for reducing lipid accumulation in macrophages and preventing atherosclerosis (Matsuoka2020Retinoic). Additionally, microRNA-26b (miR-26b) targets NCEH1, influencing its expression and potentially modulating cholesterol metabolism in conditions like psoriasis (Cheung2016Psoriasis).
