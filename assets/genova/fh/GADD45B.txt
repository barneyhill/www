# GADD45B

## Overview
GADD45B is a gene that encodes the growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible beta protein, which is a member of the GADD45 family involved in cellular stress responses. The protein plays a crucial role in regulating DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis, acting as a stress sensor within the cell nucleus (Hoffman2008Gadd45; Liebermann2007Gadd45). As a member of the ribosomal protein L7Ae/L30e/S12e/Gadd45 superfamily, GADD45B is characterized by its ability to interact with various proteins, including kinases, to modulate signaling pathways related to cell survival and stress responses (Zipperly2020Regulation; Smaldone2021Members). The protein's involvement in active DNA demethylation processes also highlights its significance in neuroepigenetics, particularly in memory formation and synaptic plasticity (Sultan2013The). GADD45B's expression and function are implicated in several clinical conditions, including neurological disorders and cancer, where it can act as either a tumor suppressor or an oncogene depending on the context (BarrosFilho2020GADD45B; Michaelis2011Identification).

## Function
GADD45B is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, including DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis. In healthy human cells, GADD45B plays a critical role in modulating stress responses and maintaining genomic stability. It is primarily localized in the cell nucleus, where it acts as a stress sensor and is rapidly induced by genotoxic agents and cytokines (Hoffman2008Gadd45; Liebermann2007Gadd45).

GADD45B is involved in cell cycle arrest and DNA repair, contributing to cell survival under stress conditions. It interacts with various proteins to influence cell cycle regulation and stress responses, such as inhibiting the MKK4-JNK apoptotic pathway, which promotes cell survival (Hoffman2008Gadd45). The protein also plays a role in apoptosis, acting as a positive modulator of TGF-β-induced cell death and enhancing apoptosis in certain cell types (Hoffman2008Gadd45).

In the nervous system, GADD45B is implicated in the regulation of memory formation and synaptic plasticity. It is involved in active DNA demethylation processes, particularly in the hippocampus, which is crucial for memory consolidation (Sultan2013The). GADD45B facilitates the demethylation of specific gene promoters, essential for neuronal activity and memory, highlighting its role in cognitive neuroepigenetics (Sultan2013The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GADD45B gene are associated with various neurological and oncological conditions. In the context of stroke, GADD45B is involved in neurogenesis and axonal plasticity, with increased expression following ischemic stroke and environmental enrichment treatment. Inhibition of GADD45B can reduce neurogenesis induced by environmental enrichment (Shen2022The). In Alzheimer's disease, GADD45B is implicated in memory formation and synaptic plasticity, with its expression being activated by extracellular α-synuclein (Shen2022The). 

In Parkinson's disease, GADD45B expression increases in the substantia nigra, potentially contributing to neuronal death through chromatin structure loss and altered DNA methylation (Shen2022The). In schizophrenia, GADD45B expression is diminished in the prefrontal cortex, which may affect neurotransmitter function and gene expression through DNA demethylation processes (Huang2024Advances).

In cancer, GADD45B acts as a tumor suppressor in pituitary gonadotrope tumors, where its reduced expression is associated with increased tumorigenicity (Michaelis2011Identification). Conversely, in colorectal carcinoma, GADD45B is upregulated and associated with a higher risk of relapse and death, suggesting a complex role in carcinogenesis (Wang2012Abnormal). In papillary thyroid carcinoma, higher GADD45B expression is linked to shorter disease-free survival and is an independent predictor of relapse (BarrosFilho2020GADD45B).

## Interactions
GADD45B interacts with several proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, stress response, and apoptosis. It binds to proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a key player in DNA repair and replication, suggesting a role in nucleotide excision repair (Liebermann2007Gadd45). GADD45B also interacts with the cdc2/cyclinB1 complex, inhibiting its kinase activity, which is crucial for the G2/M phase transition in the cell cycle, thereby activating the G2/M checkpoint in response to genotoxic stress (Liebermann2007Gadd45). 

GADD45B is known to interact with the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, although the specific role of this interaction remains unclear (Liebermann2007Gadd45). It also interacts with and activates MEKK4, an upstream activator of the p38/JNK MAP kinase pathways, which are involved in stress-induced responses (Schmitz2013Gadd45; Liebermann2007Gadd45). In immune cells, GADD45B inhibits MAPK JNK activation by inhibiting the upstream kinase MKK7 in TNFα-treated T cell hybridomas (Schmitz2013Gadd45). 

GADD45B's interaction with Huwe1, a ubiquitin ligase, affects the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its downstream signaling, suggesting a regulatory relationship through the ubiquitination pathway (He2015Huwe1).
