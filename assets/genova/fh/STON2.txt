# STON2

## Overview
STON2 is a gene that encodes the protein stonin 2, which plays a pivotal role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a fundamental cellular process for internalizing molecules and recycling synaptic vesicles. Stonin 2 functions as an adaptor protein, primarily interacting with the clathrin adaptor complex AP-2 and synaptotagmin I, which are essential for synaptic vesicle recycling and neurotransmitter release. The protein is characterized by its multiple AP-2 interaction motifs within its N-terminal domain, which are crucial for its endocytic function (Walther2004Functional). Stonin 2 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, especially in axonal vesicle clusters, where it colocalizes with synaptotagmin I, influencing synaptic transmission (Walther2004Functional). Its role extends beyond neuronal cells, as it also facilitates the internalization of synaptotagmin I in non-neuronal cells, underscoring its function as an endocytic adaptor (Azarnia2019Endocytic).

## Structure


## Function
STON2 (stonin 2) is a protein involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a critical cellular process for internalizing molecules and recycling synaptic vesicles. It functions as an adaptor protein, interacting with the clathrin adaptor complex AP-2 and synaptotagmin I, which is essential for synaptic vesicle recycling and neurotransmitter release. The N-terminal domain of STON2 contains multiple AP-2 interaction motifs, which are crucial for its role in endocytosis (Walther2004Functional).

STON2 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, particularly in axonal vesicle clusters, where it colocalizes with synaptotagmin I. This localization is facilitated by its homology domain, which recruits STON2 to the plasmalemma, thereby influencing synaptic transmission (Walther2004Functional). The protein's interaction with AP-2 is mediated through WVxF motifs, which are essential for binding and inhibiting transferrin internalization, highlighting its role in receptor-mediated endocytosis (Walther2004Functional).

In non-neuronal cells, STON2 also facilitates the internalization of synaptotagmin I, further supporting its function as an endocytic adaptor. This interaction is crucial for maintaining synaptotagmin I at the synapse, which is vital for efficient neurotransmitter release (Azarnia2019Endocytic).

## Clinical Significance
STON2 (stonin 2) has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), STON2 overexpression is associated with unfavorable prognosis, including intraperitoneal metastasis, recurrence, and platinum resistance. High STON2 expression correlates with decreased overall survival and progression-free survival, making it a potential independent prognostic factor for EOC patients (Sun2017Stonin). 

In papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), STON2 is identified as a direct target of miR-199b-5p. Its overexpression promotes tumor growth, migration, and invasion, correlating with advanced disease stages and poor prognosis. The miR-199b-5p/STON2 axis is considered a potential therapeutic target for PTC (Ren2018miR‐199b‐5p‐Stonin).

In schizophrenia, genetic variations in the STON2 gene have been associated with the disorder. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in STON2 show significant differences in allele and genotype frequencies between patients and controls, suggesting a genetic link to schizophrenia (Luan2011Positive).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of STON2 in various diseases, emphasizing its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target.

## Interactions
STON2, also known as stonin 2, is involved in several key interactions within the clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway. It primarily interacts with the adaptor protein complex AP-2, facilitating the retrieval of synaptic vesicle proteins such as synaptotagmin 1. Stonin 2 specifically binds to the C2A domain of synaptotagmin 1, while AP-2 interacts with the C2B domain, highlighting a coordinated mechanism for synaptotagmin 1 retrieval during synaptic vesicle endocytosis (Gordon2016The). 

STON2 does not bind directly to clathrin, distinguishing its interaction profile from other adaptor proteins. Instead, its connectivity is primarily through AP-2, which affects its stoichiometric balance in the endocytic network (Duan2020Integrating; Duan2022Integrating). 

In addition to its role in synaptic vesicle protein retrieval, STON2 is implicated in interactions with other proteins such as SV2A, which also participates in synaptotagmin 1 retrieval. This suggests a potential functional redundancy between STON2 and SV2A, as both proteins are necessary for efficient trafficking of synaptotagmin 1 (Gordon2016The). These interactions are crucial for maintaining synaptic function and neurotransmitter release.
