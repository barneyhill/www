# PACSIN2

## Overview
PACSIN2 is a gene that encodes the protein known as protein kinase C and casein kinase substrate in neurons 2, which is a member of the F-BAR domain-containing protein family. This protein is primarily involved in membrane deformation activities, playing a crucial role in cellular processes such as endocytosis, membrane trafficking, and cytoskeletal organization. The F-BAR domain of the PACSIN2 protein facilitates its interaction with the plasma membrane, enabling the formation of invaginated tubular structures and influencing caveolae biogenesis. Additionally, PACSIN2 is involved in regulating cell adhesion and migration, maintaining endothelial barrier integrity, and modulating protein interactions that affect cellular signaling pathways. Its clinical significance is underscored by its association with various diseases, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, inflammatory bowel disease, and diabetic kidney disease, where alterations in PACSIN2 expression or function can impact disease progression and treatment outcomes (Hansen2011Pacsin; Dumont2017PACSIN2; Cousin2008PACSIN2).

## Structure
PACSIN2 is a member of the F-BAR domain-containing proteins, which are involved in membrane deformation activities. The primary structure of PACSIN2 includes a coiled-coil region that facilitates dimerization (Wang2009Molecular). The secondary structure is characterized by alpha-helices, with the monomer in each dimer composed of a core bundle of α helices 1, 2, 5, and 6, and two helix bundle arms of α helices 3 and 4 extending from the central body (Bai2013Tiptotip). 

The tertiary structure of PACSIN2 involves the F-BAR domain forming a crescent shape, which is crucial for its function in membrane binding and tubulation (Shimada2010Mapping). This domain features a concave surface that interacts with the negatively charged inner surface of the plasma membrane, facilitating the formation of invaginated tubular structures (Shimada2010Mapping). 

In terms of quaternary structure, PACSIN2 forms a tetrameric arrangement with two neighboring dimers, each adopting a crescent shape with a positively charged surface (Bai2013Tiptotip). The protein also exhibits unique tip-to-tip interactions that are important for its tubulation activity (Bai2013Tiptotip). Common post-translational modifications include phosphorylation (Wang2009Molecular).

## Function
PACSIN2 is a cytoplasmic protein involved in various cellular processes, including endocytosis, membrane trafficking, and cytoskeletal organization. It plays a significant role in the formation of caveolae, small invaginations in the plasma membrane, by interacting with caveolin 1 and influencing caveolar biogenesis. The F-BAR domain of PACSIN2 is crucial for its function in membrane curvature and caveolae formation, as its depletion leads to a loss of morphologically defined caveolae and an accumulation of caveolin proteins at the plasma membrane (Hansen2011Pacsin).

PACSIN2 also regulates cell adhesion and migration by modulating integrin activity, particularly the α5β1 integrin, during developmental processes such as gastrulation in Xenopus laevis. It affects the recruitment of integrins to focal adhesions, which is essential for cell spreading and morphogenetic movements (Cousin2008PACSIN2).

In endothelial cells, PACSIN2 is involved in maintaining endothelial barrier integrity by inhibiting the internalization of VE-cadherin from adherens junctions. This function is vital for preserving cell-cell junctions and ensuring proper vascular function (Dorland2016The). PACSIN2's role in these processes highlights its importance in cellular organization and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PACSIN2 gene have been associated with various clinical conditions. In pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the PACSIN2 rs2413739 TT genotype is linked to an increased risk of thiopurine-induced hematological toxicity during maintenance therapy. This risk is particularly pronounced in patients with the wild-type TPMT genotype, suggesting a gene-gene interaction that influences drug sensitivity and toxicity (Smid2016PACSIN2).

PACSIN2 also plays a role in modulating autophagy, which has implications for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Lower levels of PACSIN2 expression are observed in inflamed colon tissues of pediatric IBD patients, correlating with increased autophagy and inflammation. This suggests that PACSIN2 expression alterations may contribute to the pathogenesis of IBD by affecting autophagy regulation (Zudeh2023PACSIN2as).

In diabetic kidney disease, PACSIN2 is up-regulated and involved in nephrin trafficking. Its overexpression accelerates nephrin endocytosis and recycling, which may impact kidney function and contribute to disease progression (Dumont2017PACSIN2). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PACSIN2 in various diseases through its influence on cellular processes and drug responses.

## Interactions
PACSIN2, also known as protein kinase C and casein kinase substrate in neurons 2, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with the nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) of the hepatitis C virus (HCV), playing a role in HCV assembly. This interaction is mediated through the F-BAR domain of PACSIN2 and domain I of NS5A, with phosphorylation at serine 313 of PACSIN2 affecting the binding strength (Nguyen2020PACSIN2). NS5A modulates the phosphorylation status of PACSIN2, enhancing their interaction and facilitating HCV virion assembly (Nguyen2020PACSIN2).

PACSIN2 also interacts with Rac1, a small GTPase, through its SH3 domain. This interaction is specific to the hypervariable C-terminus of Rac1 and is crucial for regulating Rac1 signaling, cell spreading, and migration (de2011The). PACSIN2 acts as a negative regulator of Rac1 by promoting its inactivation and targeting it to intracellular locations for GTP hydrolysis (de2011The).

Additionally, PACSIN2 directly binds to actin filaments, a unique feature among BAR domain proteins, using its concave surface to interact with the negatively charged actin filaments (Kostan2014Direct). This interaction is significant for membrane remodeling processes and is not common among other BAR domain proteins (Kostan2014Direct).
