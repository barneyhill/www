# LACTBL1

## Overview
The LACTBL1 gene encodes the protein lactamase beta like 1, which is a member of the beta-lactamase-like protein family. This protein is characterized by its structural similarity to beta-lactamases, enzymes that are typically involved in antibiotic resistance by breaking down beta-lactam antibiotics. However, lactamase beta like 1 does not exhibit the same enzymatic activity and is instead implicated in various cellular processes, although its precise biological function remains to be fully elucidated. The gene is expressed in multiple tissues, suggesting a potentially broad role in human physiology. Research into LACTBL1 and its encoded protein continues to explore its interactions and potential implications in health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
