# PRR14

## Overview
PRR14 is a gene that encodes the proline-rich protein 14, a tethering protein involved in chromatin organization within the nucleus. The PRR14 protein is characterized by its high proline content and is primarily known for its role in anchoring heterochromatin to the nuclear lamina, a critical component of nuclear architecture. This protein contains several functional domains, including an N-terminal HP1-binding motif and a central Lamina Binding Domain (LBD), which facilitate its interactions with heterochromatin and the nuclear lamina, respectively (Poleshko2013The; Dunlevy2019The). PRR14's dynamic association with the nuclear lamina is regulated by phosphorylation, influencing its role during the cell cycle, particularly in mitosis. Beyond its structural functions, PRR14 is implicated in various biological processes, including skeletal myogenesis, and is associated with clinical conditions such as breast cancer and Parkinson's disease, where its expression levels are altered (Ren2020Oncogene; Yang2015A; Zheng2022Increased).

## Structure
The PRR14 protein is a human tethering protein involved in anchoring heterochromatin to the nuclear lamina. It is composed of 585 amino acids and is characterized by a high proline content, which may influence its structural conformation (Poleshko2013The). The protein contains several modular domains that mediate its function. The N-terminal region (1-135) includes a conserved HP1-binding motif (LAVVL) crucial for binding to heterochromatin, colocalizing with HP1a and the H3K9me3 histone modification (Poleshko2013The; Dunlevy2019The). 

The central region of PRR14 contains a Lamina Binding Domain (LBD) spanning positions 231-282, which is necessary and sufficient for nuclear lamina localization. This domain is regulated by phosphorylation, with specific phosphorylation sites identified at S242, T266, T270, and S277 (Dunlevy2019The). The C-terminal Tantalus domain interacts with the PP2A phosphatase, specifically the B56alpha subunit, playing a role in regulating PRR14's association with the nuclear lamina (Dunlevy2019The).

PRR14 does not associate with nuclear membranes but relies on the nuclear lamina component Lamin A/C for localization. During mitosis, PRR14 disperses and colocalizes with HP1 on chromosomes, suggesting a potential mitotic bookmarking role (Dunlevy2019The). The protein's dynamic association with the nuclear lamina is phosphoregulated, with rapid exchange observed through fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments (Dunlevy2019The).

## Function
The PRR14 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in tethering heterochromatin to the nuclear lamina, a structure that provides mechanical support to the nucleus and is involved in chromatin organization and gene regulation. PRR14 localizes to the nuclear lamina during interphase and mitotic exit, where it binds heterochromatin through its N-terminal domain and associates with the nuclear lamina via a centrally located, evolutionarily conserved nuclear lamina binding domain (LBD) (Poleshko2013The; Dunlevy2019The). This interaction is essential for maintaining the peripheral localization of heterochromatin, contributing to the structural organization of the nucleus in healthy human cells (Poleshko2013The).

PRR14's function is regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation cycles, which influence its dynamic association with the nuclear lamina. Phosphorylation events, particularly at serine-proline and threonine-proline sites, lead to the disassembly of PRR14 from the nuclear lamina during mitosis (Dunlevy2019The). The protein interacts with the B56alpha regulatory subunit of PP2A, and its localization is regulated by these phosphorylation events (Dunlevy2019The).

PRR14 also plays a role in skeletal myogenesis by enhancing the transcriptional activity of MyoD, a master transcription factor in muscle differentiation, through its interaction with HP1α (Yang2015A). This activity supports cell survival and maintains the stability and structure of lamin A/C, a component of the nuclear lamina, which is crucial for proper nuclear organization during muscle cell differentiation (Yang2015A).

## Clinical Significance
The PRR14 gene is implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In breast cancer, PRR14 is frequently overexpressed, particularly in the 16p11.2 region, which is often amplified in these tumors. This overexpression is linked to the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and the inhibition of the CHEK2 pathway, contributing to cancer cell proliferation and resistance to chemotherapy (Ren2020Oncogene). PRR14's role in breast cancer is primarily due to overexpression rather than mutation, making it a potential therapeutic target (Ren2020Oncogene).

In Parkinson's disease (PD), PRR14 expression is significantly upregulated, particularly in the serum of patients. This upregulation is associated with the mTOR signaling pathway, which affects autophagy and the accumulation of α-synuclein, a hallmark of PD. While increased PRR14 levels may protect dopaminergic neurons, they can also inhibit autophagy, potentially exacerbating PD symptoms (Jin2020Preliminary; Zheng2022Increased). PRR14's involvement in PD suggests its potential as a biomarker for diagnosis and its role in disease pathogenesis (Zheng2022Increased).

## Interactions
PRR14 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in chromatin organization and nuclear architecture. A key interaction is with heterochromatin protein 1 alpha (HP1α), facilitated by a conserved HP1-binding motif (LAVVL) within the N-terminal region of PRR14. This interaction is essential for PRR14's binding to heterochromatin, as mutations in this motif or knockdown of HP1 result in the loss of heterochromatin localization (Poleshko2013The; Dunlevy2019The). PRR14 also associates with the nuclear lamina through its central lamina-binding domain, interacting specifically with Lamin A/C. This interaction is necessary for tethering heterochromatin to the nuclear periphery, as demonstrated by the redistribution of PRR14 from the nuclear lamina to the nucleoplasm upon Lamin A/C knockdown (Poleshko2013The; Dunlevy2019The).

During mitosis, PRR14 dissociates from the nuclear lamina and chromatin, becoming soluble. It rebinds to chromatin in anaphase through its interaction with HP1, guided by H3K9me2/3 marks, and subsequently relocates to the nuclear lamina in telophase (Poleshko2013The; Dunlevy2019The). PRR14's interaction with HP1α is also significant in the context of skeletal myogenesis, where it enhances the activity of MyoD, a muscle-specific transcription factor (Yang2015A).
