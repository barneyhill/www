# CNOT8

## Overview
CNOT8 is a gene that encodes the protein CCR4-NOT transcription complex subunit 8, which is a critical component of the CCR4-NOT complex, a multifunctional regulator of mRNA metabolism. This protein is primarily involved in mRNA deadenylation, a process that shortens the poly(A) tail of mRNA, thereby influencing mRNA stability and decay, and ultimately regulating gene expression (Chalabi2020The; Shirai2014Multifunctional). As a subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex, CNOT8 plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and proliferation, by interacting with other proteins and RNA molecules (Doidge2012Deadenylation). The protein is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, indicating its broad functional importance (Shirai2014Multifunctional). Alterations in CNOT8 expression have been linked to several diseases, including cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Chalabi2020The; Shirai2014Multifunctional).

## Function
CNOT8, also known as hCAF1b, is a subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex, which is a major regulator of mRNA metabolism in human cells. It plays a crucial role in mRNA deadenylation, a process that shortens the poly(A) tail of mRNA, leading to mRNA decay and regulation of gene expression (Chalabi2020The; Shirai2014Multifunctional). CNOT8 is involved in the decay of ARE-containing β-globin mRNA and is essential for the proliferation of MCF7 human breast cancer cells (Shirai2014Multifunctional). It interacts with BTG/Tob proteins, which regulate cell cycle progression and are required for the anti-proliferative activities of Tob proteins, suggesting its involvement in regulating cell cycle and proliferation in healthy human cells (Shirai2014Multifunctional).

CNOT8 is ubiquitously expressed in adult mouse tissues, with high expression levels in the thymus, spleen, ovary, and testis, indicating its broad role in cellular processes (Shirai2014Multifunctional). It is part of the CCR4-NOT complex that influences mRNA stability and turnover, interacting with RNA-binding proteins and microRNAs to facilitate mRNA degradation (Chalabi2020The). CNOT8 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it affects mRNA stability and translation (Doidge2012Deadenylation).

## Clinical Significance
CNOT8, a component of the CCR4-NOT complex, has been implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression levels. Elevated expression of CNOT8 has been observed in colorectal carcinomas and associated metastases, suggesting a potential role in the development and progression of colorectal cancer (Chalabi2020The; Shirai2014Multifunctional). This overexpression may contribute to cancer by affecting mRNA deadenylation and gene expression regulation, processes in which the CCR4-NOT complex is involved.

CNOT8, along with CNOT7, is also required for the proliferation of MCF7 human breast cancer cells, indicating its role in cancer cell growth (Shirai2014Multifunctional). The knockdown of CNOT8, along with CNOT7, has been shown to increase the mRNA stability of genes involved in growth arrest, such as PMP22 and cyclin G2, which may influence cell cycle regulation and cancer progression (Chalabi2020The).

Additionally, the loss of CNOT8, as part of the CCR4-NOT complex, has been associated with genome instability, evidenced by increased DNA damage markers and the formation of micronuclei, which could contribute to conditions characterized by genomic instability (Hagkarim2023Disruption).

## Interactions
CNOT8, a subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex, participates in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in mRNA deadenylation and decay. CNOT8 interacts with members of the BTG/Tob protein family, specifically binding to the BTG domain of Tob1, which acts as an adaptor protein. This interaction facilitates the recruitment of the CCR4-NOT complex to mRNAs by binding to the C-terminal domain of PABP through PAM2 (Doidge2012Deadenylation). CNOT8 also interacts with CPEB3, a sequence-specific RNA-binding protein, aiding in the recruitment of the complex to the 3'-UTR of mRNA, leading to deadenylation and mRNA turnover (Doidge2012Deadenylation).

CNOT8 is involved in interactions with eRFs and the Pan2-Pan3 complex, contributing to general deadenylation processes coupled to translation termination (Doidge2012Deadenylation). It can form heterodimers with CNOT6 or CNOT6L, which may alter the mRNA decay mechanism (Eskandarian2020Importance). CNOT8, along with its paralog CNOT7, binds to the human CNOT1 subunit, although their presence in the complex is mutually exclusive (Winkler2013Heterogeneity). These interactions underscore CNOT8's role in mRNA deadenylation and decay through a network of protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions.
