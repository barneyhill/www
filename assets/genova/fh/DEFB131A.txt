# DEFB131A

## Overview
DEFB131A is a gene that encodes the protein defensin beta 131A, which is a member of the beta-defensin family of antimicrobial peptides. These peptides are integral to the innate immune system, primarily functioning to protect mucosal surfaces by disrupting the membrane integrity of invading pathogens. Defensin beta 131A is categorized as an antimicrobial peptide and is predominantly expressed in epithelial cells, where it plays a significant role in maintaining oral health by interacting with the oral microbiome. The gene is located in a genomic region characterized by structural variations, which can influence its expression and potentially affect an individual's susceptibility to infections and other health conditions (Ebersole2022Gingival; Hollox2008Defensins).

## Function
DEFB131A, a beta-defensin, is involved in the innate immune response by providing antimicrobial activity. This protein functions by disrupting the membrane integrity of pathogens, thereby protecting mucosal surfaces against microbial invasion. It is expressed in epithelial cells, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance between health and disease in the oral cavity (Ebersole2022Gingival). The expression of DEFB131A and other antimicrobial factor (AMF) genes is influenced by the composition of the oral microbiome, with certain bacterial families affecting the expression levels of these genes (Ebersole2022Gingival).

In healthy conditions, DEFB131A is part of a complex network of AMFs that interact with the oral microbiome to regulate microbial colonization and prevent overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria. This interaction is essential for maintaining oral health and preventing diseases such as periodontitis (Ebersole2022Gingival). The gene is located in a region of the human genome known for structural variations, which can affect its expression and potentially influence susceptibility to infections and other health conditions (Hollox2008Defensins).
