# SLC25A52

## Overview
SLC25A52 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 25 member 52, which is part of the solute carrier (SLC) family. This family is known for its role in the transport of various molecules across cellular membranes. The protein encoded by SLC25A52 is categorized as a transmembrane transporter, facilitating the movement of specific substrates across the mitochondrial membrane. This function is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and energy production. The gene and its encoded protein are subjects of ongoing research due to their potential implications in metabolic disorders and mitochondrial dysfunctions. Understanding the precise mechanisms and interactions of SLC25A52 could provide insights into novel therapeutic targets for related diseases (Qiu2020aarFDC).
