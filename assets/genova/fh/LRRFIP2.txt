# LRRFIP2

## Overview
LRRFIP2, or Leucine-Rich Repeat (LRR) binding FLII interacting protein 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of immune responses. The protein encoded by LRRFIP2 is a key player in modulating the activity of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a critical component of the innate immune system that regulates inflammation. By interacting with proteins such as Flightless-I and NLRP3, LRRFIP2 inhibits the activation of caspase-1 and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β, thereby maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive inflammatory responses (Jin2013LRRFIP2). Beyond its role in inflammation, LRRFIP2 is implicated in the Wnt signaling pathway and TLR4 signaling, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular signaling and immune regulation (Jin2013LRRFIP2). Additionally, LRRFIP2's involvement in alternative splicing and protein interactions suggests its potential impact on cancer metastasis and other pathological conditions (Zhang2013Identification; Lee2022ESRP1regulated).

## Function
LRRFIP2 (LRR binding FLII interacting protein 2) functions as a negative regulator of the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages, playing a crucial role in controlling inflammatory responses. It promotes the interaction between Flightless-I and the NLRP3 inflammasome, inhibiting caspase-1 activation and subsequent IL-1β secretion, which are key steps in the inflammatory process (Jin2013LRRFIP2). This regulation is essential for maintaining a balance between inflammasome activation and inhibition, preventing excessive inflammatory responses that could lead to autoinflammatory syndromes and metabolic diseases (Jin2013LRRFIP2).

LRRFIP2 interacts with NLRP3 through its N-terminal motif and with Flightless-I via its Coil motif, facilitating the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activity (Jin2013LRRFIP2). It is also involved in the co-localization of the NLRP3 inflammasome with F-actin, which is necessary for inhibiting inflammasome activity (Burger2016Factin). In addition to its role in inflammation, LRRFIP2 is expressed in various tissues and has been implicated in other cellular processes, such as activating the Wnt signaling pathway and acting as a positive regulator of TLR4 signaling (Jin2013LRRFIP2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the LRRFIP2 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In gastric cancer, the alternative splicing of LRRFIP2, regulated by ESRP1, plays a significant role in metastasis. Specifically, LRRFIP2 variant 3 is associated with increased metastatic potential, while variant 2 is linked to reduced metastasis. The overexpression of variant 3 enhances the transcription of metastasis-promoting genes like SERPINE1, contributing to the invasiveness of gastric cancer cells (Lee2022ESRP1regulated).

In the context of Lynch syndrome, a genomic deletion involving LRRFIP2 and the MLH1 gene has been identified as a founder mutation in Portuguese families. This deletion is associated with high microsatellite instability and the absence of MLH1 expression in tumors, contributing to the pathogenesis of Lynch syndrome (Pinheiro2011A).

LRRFIP2 also plays a role in embryonic cardiogenesis by modulating the HIF-1α signaling pathway. Its absence leads to overactivation of HIF-1α target genes, resulting in cardiac malformations and embryonic lethality. This suggests that LRRFIP2 is crucial for proper heart development and its dysfunction can lead to severe cardiac developmental issues (Driss2021LRRFIP2).

## Interactions
LRRFIP2 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in immune response regulation. It binds to Flightless-I (FLII) via its Coil motif, which is crucial for inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages. This interaction enhances the binding of Flightless-I to caspase-1, inhibiting its activation and subsequent IL-1b secretion (Jin2013LRRFIP2). LRRFIP2 also interacts with NLRP3 through its N-terminal motif, negatively regulating NLRP3 inflammasome activation by promoting the interaction between Flightless-I and caspase-1 (Jin2013LRRFIP2).

In the context of gastric cancer, LRRFIP2 undergoes alternative splicing regulated by ESRP1, resulting in different isoforms that interact with CARM1, a coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase. LRRFIP2 variant 2 strongly interacts with CARM1, inhibiting its oncogenic function, while variant 3 shows minimal interaction, failing to inhibit CARM1's activity (Lee2022ESRP1regulated). This interaction affects the transcriptional regulation of genes like SERPINE1, influencing cancer metastasis (Lee2022ESRP1regulated).

In shrimp, LRRFIP2 interacts with MyD88, a key adaptor protein in TLR signaling pathways, positively regulating NF-kB activity and antimicrobial peptide gene expression (Zhang2013Identification).
