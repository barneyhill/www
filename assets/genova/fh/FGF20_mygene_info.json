The fibroblast growth factors possess broad mitogenic and cell survival activities, and are involved in a variety of biological processes including embryonic development, cell growth, morphogenesis, tissue repair, tumor growth and invasion. This gene product is a secreted neurotrophic factor but lacks a typical signal peptide. It is expressed in normal brain, particularly the cerebellum, and may regulate central nervous system development and function. Homodimerization of this protein was shown to regulate its receptor binding activity and concentration gradient in the extracellular matrix. Genetic variations of this gene have been associated with Parkinson disease susceptibility.
