# CSNK2A1

## Overview
The CSNK2A1 gene encodes the protein casein kinase 2 alpha 1 (CK2α), a serine/threonine protein kinase that plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes. As a member of the CMGC family of eukaryotic protein kinases, CK2α is involved in the regulation of cell cycle, apoptosis, and DNA repair, and is ubiquitously expressed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of cells (Borgo2021Protein; Meggio2003One‐thousand‐and‐one). The protein functions as part of the protein kinase CK2 enzyme, which can exist as a monomer or as a heterotetrameric complex with regulatory subunits, allowing it to participate in a wide array of signaling pathways, including PI3K/Akt and Wnt/β-catenin (Unni2022Predictive). CK2α's ability to phosphorylate numerous substrates underscores its importance in cellular signaling and its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases such as cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders (Guerra2008Protein; Chiu2018Okur‐Chung).

## Structure
The CSNK2A1 gene encodes the CK2α protein, a serine/threonine protein kinase that is part of the protein kinase CK2 enzyme. CK2α exhibits a kinase-typical bilobal architecture, with an N-terminal domain featuring a central β-sheet and an α-helical C-terminal domain. These domains contain common structural and functional elements of eukaryotic protein kinases, such as the Gly-rich loop, hinge region, catalytic loop, activation loop, and P+1 loop (Unni2022Predictive). CK2α belongs to the CMGC family of eukaryotic protein kinases, characterized by a helical insert after helix αG in the C-terminal lobe (Unni2022Predictive).

CK2α is present in cells both as a monomer and as part of a heterotetrameric enzyme composed of two CK2α subunits bound to a dimer of two CK2β subunits, indicating its quaternary structure (Unni2022Predictive). The protein can use both ATP and GTP as cosubstrates, with an acidophilic substrate profile determined by two anion binding sites at the activation segment (Unni2022Predictive). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and nitrosylation at specific residues may influence protein function (Unni2022Predictive). The CK2α-paralog CK2α' is encoded by the CSNK2A2 gene and differs mainly in the length and sequence of the C-terminus (Unni2022Predictive).

## Function
The CSNK2A1 gene encodes the alpha subunit of casein kinase 2 (CK2), a serine/threonine-selective protein kinase that is constitutively active and involved in numerous cellular processes. CK2 is a key player in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and DNA repair, and it is ubiquitously expressed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of cells (Borgo2021Protein; Meggio2003One‐thousand‐and‐one). 

CK2 is involved in the phosphorylation of a wide array of substrates, influencing various signaling pathways such as PI3K/Akt, IKK/NFκB, and Wnt/β-catenin. These pathways are crucial for cell survival, proliferation, and DNA repair (Borgo2021Protein). In the PI3K/Akt pathway, CK2 phosphorylates Akt1, enhancing its activity, and PTEN, inhibiting its phosphatase activity, thereby promoting cell survival (Borgo2021Protein). CK2 also plays a role in synaptic plasticity and memory, as its activity is linked to cognitive functions and neurological processes (Guerra2008Protein).

CK2's involvement in apoptosis is highlighted by its ability to phosphorylate caspase-3, making proteins resistant to caspase cleavage and thus contributing to its anti-apoptotic role (Meggio2003One‐thousand‐and‐one). The kinase also regulates the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway, affecting inflammatory responses and cancer progression (Guerra2008Protein).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CSNK2A1 gene are associated with Okur-Chung Neurodevelopmental Syndrome (OCNDS), a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by intellectual disability, developmental delays, hypotonia, and dysmorphic facial features (Zhuri2023A; Chiu2018Okur‐Chung). These mutations include missense, nonsense, splice, and frameshift variants, which can lead to decreased kinase activity and altered subcellular localization of the CK2α protein (Unni2022Predictive). Specific mutations such as Lys198Arg and Arg47Gln are located in highly conserved regions critical for CK2 activity and are associated with a general reduction of CK2 activity (Borgo2021Protein).

Alterations in CSNK2A1 expression are also linked to various other conditions. In diabetes, CK2α is upregulated in ventricular cardiomyocytes and pancreatic β-cells, contributing to complications such as diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy (Borgo2021Protein). In cancer, altered CK2 activity affects cell proliferation and survival pathways, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Borgo2021Protein). The gene's involvement in these diverse conditions underscores its critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential impact when dysregulated.

## Interactions
CSNK2A1, also known as casein kinase 2 alpha 1, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. In gastric cancer, CSNK2A1 interacts with the long non-coding RNA B3GALT5-AS1. This interaction is crucial for the progression of gastric cancer, as B3GALT5-AS1 is highly expressed in cancer cell lines and influences CSNK2A1 expression. The knockdown of B3GALT5-AS1 results in decreased CSNK2A1 expression, reduced cell viability, migration, and invasion, and increased apoptosis, while overexpression of CSNK2A1 can reverse these effects (Wang2021Long).

In papillary thyroid cancer, CSNK2A1 interacts with circNDST1, a circular RNA that enhances its interaction with Akt, leading to the activation of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. This interaction promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition, contributing to cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Shu2022CircNDST1).

At the neuromuscular junction, CSNK2A1 interacts with proteins such as Rapsyn, Rac1, 14-3-3γ, and Dok-7. It phosphorylates 14-3-3γ and Dok-7, influencing the aggregation of acetylcholine receptors, which is crucial for postsynaptic apparatus formation (Herrmann2015Protein).
