# TRIM27

## Overview
TRIM27 is a gene located on chromosome 6 in humans, encoding the protein tripartite motif containing 27, which is a member of the TRIM protein family. This protein is characterized by a tripartite motif that includes an N-terminal RING finger domain, B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region, classifying it as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The TRIM27 protein plays a crucial role in various cellular processes by facilitating the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins, thereby influencing signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT, Wnt/β-catenin, and NF-κB. These pathways are integral to cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and immune responses. TRIM27's involvement in these pathways links it to several diseases, including cancer and immune-related disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2018TRIM27; Zhuang2016Trim27; Yu2022Emerging).

## Structure
TRIM27 is a protein encoded by the TRIM27 gene, located on chromosome 6 in humans. The protein is composed of 533 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 58 kDa (Yu2022Emerging). It is a member of the TRIM protein family, characterized by a tripartite motif that includes an N-terminal RING finger domain, one or two B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region. These domains are crucial for its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin to target proteins (Zhuang2016Trim27; Yu2022Emerging).

The RING domain is essential for the ubiquitination process, while the B-box domain contains a zinc-binding motif, contributing to the protein's structural integrity (Zhuang2016Trim27). The coiled-coil region is involved in homo-oligomerization, allowing TRIM27 to form high molecular weight complexes and define subcellular compartments (Zhuang2016Trim27). The C-terminal region of TRIM27 includes a PRYSPRY domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions, particularly in immune-related functions (Yu2022Emerging).

TRIM27 is subject to post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination, which regulate its activity and interactions with other proteins (Yu2022Emerging). The protein is also known to interact with various partners, including Slx2, Sumo-1, PIAS, and EPC1, indicating its involvement in diverse cellular processes (Zhuang2016Trim27).

## Function
TRIM27, a member of the TRIM protein family, functions as a RING-mediated E3 ubiquitin ligase, marking proteins for degradation. It targets proteins such as PTEN, IκBα, and p53, influencing signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Yu2022Emerging). In healthy human cells, TRIM27 interacts with the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway by ubiquitinating PTEN, which decreases PTEN's phosphatase activity, thereby promoting PI3K/AKT signaling. This pathway is crucial for cellular growth, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Yu2022Emerging).

TRIM27 also plays a role in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by interacting with and ubiquitinating SIX3, leading to its degradation and promoting the activation of the pathway, which is important for cell adhesion and transcriptional regulation (Yu2022Emerging). In the NF-κB signaling pathway, TRIM27 interacts with IκBα, leading to its ubiquitination and degradation, which in turn activates NF-κB signaling, a pathway involved in cellular growth, differentiation, immune response, and inflammation (Yu2022Emerging). TRIM27 is essential for the formation of the JAK1-STAT3 complex, promoting the activation of the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway, which is involved in cytokine signaling and gene expression (Yu2022Emerging).

## Clinical Significance
TRIM27 is implicated in various diseases due to its role in regulating key signaling pathways. In psoriasis, TRIM27 expression is up-regulated in lesional sites, contributing to IL-6-induced proliferation and inflammation in keratinocytes, which are central to the disease's pathology (Miao2020TRIM27). In cancer, TRIM27 is overexpressed in several types, including colorectal, breast, ovarian, and lung cancers, where it promotes tumor growth and metastasis through pathways such as PI3K/AKT and STAT3 (Zhang2018TRIM27; Yu2022Emerging). In colorectal cancer, high TRIM27 expression is associated with poor survival outcomes (Zhang2018TRIM27).

TRIM27 also plays a role in immune responses. It negatively regulates NOD2-mediated signaling, which is involved in inflammatory responses, and its increased expression is observed in Crohn's disease patients (Zurek2012TRIM27). In non-small cell lung cancer, TRIM27 methylation, influenced by smoking, affects patient survival, indicating a complex interaction between environmental factors and TRIM27 expression (Ji2020Epigenetic–smoking). These findings highlight TRIM27's involvement in both cancer progression and immune-related diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
TRIM27, a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) protein family, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with NOD2, a protein involved in immune responses, through its B30.2/PRY-SPRY domain. This interaction leads to the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of NOD2, negatively regulating NOD2-mediated signaling pathways (Zurek2012TRIM27). TRIM27 also interacts with kinases such as IKK-a, IKK-b, and IKK-e, affecting NF-kB, IFN-b, and ISRE activation (Zurek2012TRIM27).

In the context of inflammation and cancer, TRIM27 is a positive regulator of IL-6-induced STAT3 activation. It forms complexes with JAK1 and STAT3, facilitating their association and promoting STAT3 activation, which is crucial for cancer cell growth and tumor development (Zhang2018TRIM27). TRIM27's interaction with the retromer complex, including components like VPS35, is essential for IL-6-induced STAT3 activation (Zhang2018TRIM27).

TRIM27 also plays a role in spermatogenesis by interacting with Slx2, a protein involved in meiotic processes. This interaction is significant for the formation of XY bodies during meiosis (Zhuang2016Trim27).
