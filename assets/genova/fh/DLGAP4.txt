# DLGAP4

## Overview
DLGAP4, or Discs Large Associated Protein 4, is a gene that encodes a synaptic scaffold protein crucial for the structural and functional integrity of synapses, particularly within the postsynaptic density (PSD) of excitatory synapses. The protein, also known as SAPAP4, is involved in the assembly of macromolecular complexes that are essential for synaptic transmission and plasticity. It interacts with various synaptic proteins, including PSD-95 and SHANKs, to facilitate the linkage between neuronal cell adhesion molecules, ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors, and downstream signaling proteins. This interaction is vital for bridging the PSD and the actin cytoskeleton, thereby supporting synaptic formation and plasticity (Bai2022SAPAP). Additionally, DLGAP4 plays a significant role in cortical development by maintaining ventricular surface integrity and facilitating neuronal migration, interacting with proteins such as β-catenin and cortactin (Romero2022Novel). The gene's involvement in critical signaling pathways, such as the mTOR pathway, underscores its importance in both synaptic and cortical development (Romero2022Novel).

## Structure
DLGAP4, a member of the DLGAP protein family, is a scaffold protein involved in synaptic signaling. It contains several key domains: a 14-amino acid repeat domain, a dynein light chain (DLC) domain, and a GKAP homology domain 1 (GH1) (Rasmussen2017The). The 14-amino acid repeat domain facilitates binding to the guanylate kinase (GK) domain of DLG proteins, such as DLG1, DLG2, and DLG4 (Rasmussen2017The). The DLC domain interacts with motor protein subunits in dendrites and the postsynaptic density (PSD) (Rasmussen2017The). The GH1 domain, located at the C-terminal, consists of four alpha helices and is highly conserved among DLGAP proteins, although its specific function remains unclear (Rasmussen2017The).

DLGAP4 has multiple isoforms, with variations in the presence of the 14-amino acid repeats. The long isoform a lacks the third repeat, while the short isoforms b and c do not contain any of the five repeats (Rasmussen2017The). The protein is conserved across species, indicating its essential role in synaptic function (Rasmussen2017The). The specific post-translational modifications of DLGAP4 are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
DLGAP4, also known as DLG associated protein 4, is a synaptic scaffold protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining synaptic structure and function. It is primarily active in the postsynaptic density (PSD) of excitatory synapses, where it is involved in the dynamic assembly of macromolecular complexes essential for synaptic transmission and plasticity (Bai2022SAPAP). DLGAP4 interacts with other synaptic proteins such as PSD-95 and SHANKs, linking neuronal cell adhesion molecules, ionotropic glutamate receptors, and ion channels with metabotropic glutamate receptors and downstream signaling proteins. This interaction helps bridge the PSD and the actin cytoskeleton, facilitating synaptic formation and plasticity (Bai2022SAPAP).

DLGAP4 is also involved in cortical development, where it maintains ventricular surface integrity and facilitates proper neuronal migration. It interacts with proteins like β-catenin and cortactin, which are important for stabilizing the cadherin/catenin complex and regulating adherens junctions (AJs) (Romero2022Novel). DLGAP4 influences the mTOR signaling pathway, affecting actin cytoskeleton dynamics and neuronal positioning during cortical development (Romero2022Novel). These functions are critical for maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the developing cerebral cortex (Romero2022Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DLGAP4 gene have been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. A familial translocation between chromosomes 8 and 20, specifically t(8:20), disrupts the DLGAP4 locus and is associated with early-onset cerebellar ataxia. This condition manifests as ataxia, clumsiness, impaired hand coordination, and tremors, likely due to misregulation of glutamate receptor turnover and faulty glutamate signaling (Rasmussen2017The).

DLGAP4 mutations are also linked to cortical malformations, such as subependymal and subcortical heterotopia, which can lead to epilepsy and intellectual disability. These mutations affect neuronal migration and cortical development, potentially through disruptions in the actin cytoskeleton and mTOR signaling pathways (Romero2022Novel).

In animal models, SAPAP4 deficiency, related to DLGAP4, results in cognitive impairments and autistic-like behaviors, including hyperactivity and impaired social interactions. These findings suggest a connection between DLGAP4 alterations and autism spectrum disorders (Schob2019Cognitive). The gene's intolerance to loss-of-function mutations, indicated by a high pLI score, further underscores its clinical significance (Schob2019Cognitive).

## Interactions
DLGAP4, a member of the DLGAP family, is involved in various protein interactions crucial for synaptic and cortical development. In the postsynaptic density (PSD) of neurons, DLGAP4 interacts with the DLG family of proteins, specifically DLG1, DLG2, and DLG4, through a 14-amino acid repeat domain that binds to the GK domain of these proteins. This interaction is essential for stabilizing glutamate receptors and influencing synaptic growth (Rasmussen2017The). DLGAP4 also interacts with the SHANK family of proteins, linking them to the postsynaptic plasma membrane via the PDZ domain, which is important for PSD maturation (Rasmussen2017The).

In cortical development, DLGAP4 forms complexes with β-catenin and cortactin, which are crucial for maintaining ventricular surface integrity and neuronal migration. These interactions are involved in actin cytoskeleton remodeling and maintaining apical surface integrity (Romero2022Novel). DLGAP4 also interacts with LGN and DLG1, which are involved in cell polarity and spindle orientation in neuronal progenitors (Romero2022Novel). Additionally, DLGAP4 is linked to the mTOR signaling pathway, affecting proteins like Raptor and Rictor, which are involved in cytoskeletal signaling and neuronal migration (Romero2022Novel).
