# LYPLA2

## Overview
LYPLA2, or lysophospholipase 2, is a gene that encodes a cytosolic serine hydrolase enzyme involved in lipid metabolism. The protein, also known as acyl protein thioesterase 2 (APT2), plays a crucial role in the hydrolysis of lysophospholipids and prostaglandin glycerol esters, contributing to cellular signaling and membrane structure regulation. LYPLA2 is characterized by its atypical α/β hydrolase fold and catalytic triad, which facilitate its enzymatic activity (Won2016Molecular; Wepy2019Lysophospholipases). The enzyme is also involved in the depalmitoylation of proteins, affecting their membrane localization and function, and is particularly active in cancer cells, where it influences lipid metabolism and signaling pathways (Abrami2020Molecular; Wepy2019Lysophospholipases). LYPLA2's activity and interactions are modulated by post-translational modifications and its palmitoylation status, underscoring its significance in various physiological and pathological processes, including neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and immune responses (Jiang2020Identification; Zhang2020A).

## Structure
LYPLA2, also known as acyl protein thioesterase 2 (APT2), is a member of the serine hydrolase family and features a catalytic triad in its active site. The protein adopts an atypical α/β hydrolase fold, characterized by a central, mostly parallel β-sheet surrounded by loops, helices, and strands (Won2016Molecular). Unlike other α/β hydrolase lipases, LYPLA2 lacks a traditional cap domain and instead has a β5-α2 loop that forms a hydrophobic acyl-binding channel, which is crucial for substrate binding and hydrolysis (Won2016Molecular; Won2017Protein).

The crystal structure of LYPLA2 has been solved with specific inhibitors bound in its active sites, revealing that it can crystallize as a dimer, although it is active in both monomer and dimer forms (Wepy2019Lysophospholipases). The protein also features a hydrophobic loop, termed the ß tongue, which is essential for membrane interaction and S-acylation (Abrami2020Molecular). Post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination at Lys69, regulate its activity and stability (Abrami2020Molecular).

LYPLA2 shares high sequence homology with LYPLA1, resulting in nearly identical conformations, with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.878 Å, suggesting similar substrate specificity and hydrolytic activity (Wepy2019Lysophospholipases).

## Function
LYPLA2, or lysophospholipase 2, is a cytosolic serine hydrolase involved in the metabolism of lysophospholipids (LysoPLs), which are crucial for cellular signaling and membrane structure regulation. It hydrolyzes LysoPLs at the sn-1 and sn-2 positions, producing free fatty acids and derivatized glycerophosphates, which can be recycled to restructure lipid membranes through the Lands cycle (Wepy2019Lysophospholipases). LYPLA2 also acts as a prostaglandin glycerol ester (PG-G) hydrolase, converting PG-Gs to free prostaglandins, indicating a role in endocannabinoid metabolism (Wepy2019Lysophospholipases). 

In addition to its role in lipid metabolism, LYPLA2 exhibits thioesterase activity on palmitoylated proteins, such as the G subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins and Ras, which is important for regulating protein conformation and subcellular localization (Wepy2019Lysophospholipases). The enzyme is particularly active in cancer cells, where it hydrolyzes PGE2-G at a higher rate than LYPLA1, highlighting its significant role in lipid metabolism (Wepy2019Lysophospholipases). LYPLA2's activity is enhanced by the presence of lipid carriers like BSA, which facilitate lipid substrate availability in cellular conditions (Wepy2019Lysophospholipases).

## Clinical Significance
LYPLA2 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in lipid metabolism. Alterations in LYPLA2 expression or function can impact cellular lipid homeostasis, contributing to various pathologies. In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, LYPLA2 is involved in lysophospholipid signaling, which is linked to conditions such as cerebral atherosclerosis, vascular dementia, and Alzheimer's disease (Wepy2019Lysophospholipases). 

In cancer research, LYPLA2 has been identified as a significant gene in the prognosis of endometrial carcinoma. It is part of a prognostic model that predicts patient outcomes, with higher expression levels associated with poorer prognosis (Jiang2020Identification). 

LYPLA2 is also associated with autism, as it is one of the differentially expressed genes identified in a meta-analysis of autism cases. This suggests a potential role in the abnormal fatty acid metabolism observed in autism (Ning2015Metaanalysis).

Additionally, LYPLA2 influences STAT3 activity, which is involved in Th17 differentiation and colitis, indicating its role in immune response and inflammation (Zhang2020A). These findings highlight the diverse clinical significance of LYPLA2 across various diseases.

## Interactions
LYPLA2, also known as acyl protein thioesterase 2 (APT2), is involved in the depalmitoylation of proteins, a process crucial for their membrane localization and function. LYPLA2 interacts with membranes through a two-step process involving the insertion of a hydrophobic loop and subsequent S-acylation by palmitoyltransferases such as ZDHHC3 or ZDHHC7. Once bound to the membrane, LYPLA2 deforms the lipid bilayer to extract the acyl chain from its substrate, capturing it in a hydrophobic pocket for hydrolysis (Abrami2020Molecular).

LYPLA2 specifically affects the palmitoylation of growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43), a process that is distinct from the activity of its isoform APT1, which depalmitoylates other proteins (Won2016Molecular). The enzyme also exhibits thioesterase activity on palmitoylated proteins such as the G protein subunit and Ras, which is important for protein conformation and membrane tethering (Wepy2019Lysophospholipases).

LYPLA2's interactions are influenced by its palmitoylation status, which is essential for its membrane localization. Inhibition of palmitoylation reduces its membrane association, while inhibition of thioesterase activity increases it (Kong2013Dynamic). These interactions highlight LYPLA2's role in regulating protein localization and function through dynamic palmitoylation and depalmitoylation processes.
