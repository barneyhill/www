# TEX2

## Overview
TEX2 is a gene that encodes the testis expressed 2 protein, which is a synaptotagmin-like mitochondrial-lipid-binding (SMP) domain-containing lipid transfer protein (LTP). This protein is primarily involved in the formation and maintenance of membrane contact sites (MCSs) between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and late endosomes/lysosomes (LE/lys), playing a crucial role in lysosomal functions and lipid transfer within cells (Du2022Tex2). TEX2 is recruited to these sites by interacting with TMEM55, a phosphatase that modifies phosphoinositides on LE/lys membranes, which is essential for its function in maintaining lysosomal digestive processes and autophagic flow (Du2022Tex2). The protein's ability to transfer lipids is vital for these cellular processes, and its absence can lead to significant defects in lysosomal function (Du2022Tex2).

## Function
The TEX2 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in lysosomal functions and lipid transfer within cells. TEX2 is a synaptotagmin-like mitochondrial-lipid-binding (SMP) domain-containing lipid transfer protein (LTP) that resides on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is involved in the formation and maintenance of membrane contact sites (MCSs) between the ER and late endosomes/lysosomes (LE/lys) (Du2022Tex2). TEX2 is recruited to these sites by TMEM55, a phosphatase that converts PI(4,5)P2 to PI5P on LE/lys membranes, and this interaction is crucial for lysosomal functions (Du2022Tex2).

The protein is involved in lipid transfer at ER-lysosome MCSs, which is essential for maintaining lysosomal digestive functions and proper autophagic flow. The absence of TEX2 leads to defects in lysosomal function, including impaired autophagic flow and abnormal accumulation of PI3P on lysosomal membranes (Du2022Tex2). TEX2's lipid transfer activity is crucial for these processes, as demonstrated by the inability of a lipid transfer-deficient mutant to rescue these defects (Du2022Tex2).

## Interactions
The TEX2 protein is involved in several interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. TEX2 interacts with TMEM55B, a phosphatase that converts PI(4,5)P2 to PI5P on late endosome/lysosome (LE/lys) membranes. This interaction is mediated by the N-terminal region of TEX2 and is essential for its recruitment to ER-LE/lys membrane contact sites (MCSs) (Du2022Tex2). The interaction between TEX2 and TMEM55B is confirmed through GFP-Trap assays and in vitro pulldown assays, indicating a direct binding between these proteins (Du2022Tex2).

TEX2 also interacts with several ER-tubule shaping proteins, including RTN4 and Reep5, although it shows less interaction with ATL-1 and ARL6IP1 (Du2022Tex2). These interactions suggest a role for TEX2 in the formation and maintenance of ER structures. In the context of lipid transport, TEX2 binds to glycerophospholipids and ceramides, such as phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylserine (PS), but not cholesterol, highlighting its role in lipid transfer at ER membrane contact sites (Du2022Tex2). These interactions are critical for maintaining lysosomal functions and regulating autophagic flow.
