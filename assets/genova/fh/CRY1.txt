# CRY1

## Overview
CRY1, or cryptochrome circadian regulator 1, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the regulation of circadian rhythms in humans. The CRY1 protein is categorized as a transcriptional repressor and plays a pivotal role in the circadian clock by interacting with the CLOCK:BMAL1 complex to inhibit transcriptional activation. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the proper timing of circadian rhythms, which influence various physiological processes such as sleep-wake cycles, metabolism, and hormone release (Langmesser2008Interaction; Parico2020The). The protein contains a photolyase homology region (PHR) domain, which is essential for its function, and an intrinsically disordered C-terminal tail that modulates its activity and stability (Parico2020Thea). Variants of the CRY1 gene have been linked to several psychiatric and sleep-related disorders, highlighting its significance in human health (Onat2020Human).

## Structure
CRY1, a cryptochrome protein, plays a crucial role in regulating circadian rhythms. Its molecular structure includes a photolyase homology region (PHR) domain, which is essential for its function as a transcriptional repressor. The PHR domain is structurally similar to photolyase, featuring an N-terminal α/β subdomain and a C-terminal helical subdomain containing the FAD-binding pocket (Parico2020Thea). This domain interacts with CLOCK and BMAL1, key components of the circadian clock, at two distinct sites, which is critical for its repressive function (Parico2020Thea).

CRY1 also has an intrinsically disordered C-terminal tail, which modulates the amplitude and periodicity of circadian rhythms. This tail can influence the function of the PHR domain and is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which affect the protein's stability and intracellular distribution (Parico2020Thea). The tail's interaction with the PHR domain is reversible, playing a role in the regulation of circadian rhythms (Parico2020Thea).

The CRY1 protein can form a quaternary structure by interacting with other proteins, such as CLOCK and BMAL1, to regulate gene expression. These interactions are crucial for maintaining circadian rhythms (Parico2020Thea).

## Function
CRY1 (cryptochrome circadian regulator 1) is a crucial component of the circadian clock in humans, functioning primarily as a transcriptional repressor. It interacts with the CLOCK:BMAL1 complex to inhibit transcriptional activation, thereby playing a key role in maintaining the proper timing of circadian rhythms (Langmesser2008Interaction; Parico2020The). The CRY1 protein contains a photolyase homology region (PHR) domain that interacts with CLOCK and BMAL1, sequestering the transactivation domain from coactivators (Parico2020The). 

The CRY1 tail, particularly the region encoded by exon 11, modulates the affinity of the PHR domain for CLOCK:BMAL1. The CRY1Δ11 variant, which lacks exon 11, disrupts this interaction, leading to a longer circadian period and is associated with delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD) (Parico2020The). CRY1 also participates in two temporally distinct repressive complexes: an early complex with CRY2, PER proteins, and other regulators, and a late complex where CRY1 binds CLOCK:BMAL1 independently (Parico2020The). 

CRY1 is primarily active in the cell nucleus, where it influences sleep-wake cycles, metabolism, and hormone release by regulating the transcriptional feedback loop of the circadian clock (Langmesser2008Interaction; Narasimamurthy2012Circadian).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CRY1 gene have been associated with several psychiatric and sleep-related disorders. Notably, the CRY1Δ11 variant is linked to attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD). This variant affects the circadian rhythm by lengthening the circadian period, which can contribute to the development of these conditions (Onat2020Human). The CRY1Δ11 mutation is also associated with major depressive disorder, anxiety, and nicotine dependence, suggesting a broader impact on psychiatric health (Onat2020Human).

Another variant, CRY1Δ6, is associated with more severe psychiatric symptoms, including anxiety and oppositional defiant disorder. This variant causes an arrhythmic phenotype due to its reduced ability to interact with the BMAL1/CLOCK protein complex, which is crucial for maintaining circadian rhythms (Onat2020Human).

The CRY1 gene has also been implicated in metabolic disorders. Variants in CRY1 have shown nominal associations with hypertension and elevated triglycerides, although these findings require further validation (Kovanen2014CRY1). These associations highlight the potential role of CRY1 in both psychiatric and metabolic conditions.

## Interactions
CRY1 (cryptochrome circadian regulator 1) is a key component of the circadian clock, interacting with several proteins to regulate circadian rhythms. It primarily functions as a transcriptional repressor by binding to the CLOCK-BMAL1 complex, inhibiting its activity and thus closing the core feedback loop of the circadian clock (Ye2014Dual; Parico2020The). CRY1 interacts with the PAS domain core of CLOCK-BMAL1, with its PHR domain playing a crucial role in this interaction (Parico2020The). The CRY1 tail, particularly exon 11, modulates the affinity of the PHR domain for CLOCK-BMAL1, acting as an autoinhibitory module (Parico2020The).

CRY1 also interacts with PER proteins, forming complexes that further inhibit CLOCK-BMAL1-mediated transcriptional activation (Langmesser2008Interaction; Ye2014Dual). While CRY1 binds more strongly to BMAL1 than PER2, it does not directly interact with CLOCK, unlike PER2, which can bind both BMAL1 and CLOCK (Langmesser2008Interaction). These interactions are essential for the repression of clock-controlled gene expression, influencing the expression of genes involved in circadian rhythms (Langmesser2008Interaction).
