# ZNF736

## Overview
ZNF736 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 736, a member of the zinc finger protein family known for their role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger proteins are characterized by their finger-like protrusions that facilitate interactions with nucleic acids and other proteins. ZNF736, in particular, is involved in modulating gene expression and cellular processes through its interactions with transcriptional co-repressors such as TRIM28 and its influence on CpG-site methylation patterns (Bretherick2022Genetic; Chang2023AcetylationMimic). The protein's regulatory functions and its association with altered methylation patterns have been linked to various disease phenotypes, including proliferative verrucous leukoplakia and certain cancers, highlighting its potential significance in disease pathogenesis and as a biomarker for cancer (HerrerosPomares2021Differentially; Nishino2024Genebased; Bretherick2022Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF736 has been implicated in various disease phenotypes, particularly through its role in modulating CpG-site methylation. Altered methylation patterns associated with ZNF736 have been linked to proliferative verrucous leukoplakia (PVL), a precancerous condition. In PVL, ZNF736 is significantly downregulated and hypermethylated, suggesting its potential role in disease pathogenesis and progression to oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) (HerrerosPomares2021Differentially; Bretherick2022Genetic).

ZNF736 has also been identified in studies investigating cancer-related genes across multiple cancer types, including lung cancer. The gene-based Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium test revealed ZNF736's association with cancer, indicating its potential involvement in the pathogenesis of these diseases (Nishino2024Genebased).

Despite these associations, the exact mechanisms by which ZNF736 contributes to disease pathology remain unclear. The gene's altered expression and methylation patterns suggest it could serve as a biomarker for certain cancers, although further research is needed to elucidate its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (HerrerosPomares2021Differentially; Bretherick2022Genetic).

## Interactions
ZNF736 is a zinc finger protein that interacts with other proteins and nucleic acids, influencing gene expression and cellular processes. It is known to interact with TRIM28, a transcriptional co-repressor, in both its wild-type and acetylation-mimic mutant forms (K304Q). This interaction suggests a role in regulating gene expression, although specific details about the nature of these interactions are not fully detailed (Chang2023AcetylationMimic).

ZNF736 is also associated with significant changes in CpG-site methylation at its binding sites, which may contribute to disease pathogenesis. This association is supported by its strong correlation with altered methylation patterns, as indicated by a very low p-value (p-value = 2.14x10^-28) (Bretherick2022Genetic). The exact mechanisms by which ZNF736 influences methylation and its interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids remain unclear, but its involvement in these processes suggests a significant role in transcriptional regulation and potential disease implications.

While the specific interactions of ZNF736 with nucleic acids or other proteins are not extensively detailed, its association with TRIM28 and its impact on methylation patterns highlight its importance in gene regulatory networks.
