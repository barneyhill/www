# TUBGCP6

## Overview
TUBGCP6 is a gene that encodes the protein tubulin gamma complex component 6, which is a vital part of the γ-tubulin ring complex (γTuRC). This protein plays a crucial role in microtubule nucleation, a process essential for the proper organization of microtubules during cell division. As a component of the γTuRC, TUBGCP6 is involved in the assembly and stabilization of this complex, working in conjunction with other gamma-tubulin complex proteins such as GCP4 and GCP5. The protein's structure, characterized by specific domains and motifs, facilitates its interactions within the complex, contributing to its function in mitotic spindle formation and chromosome segregation. TUBGCP6 is highly expressed in brain tissues, indicating its significant role in brain development and function. Mutations in the TUBGCP6 gene have been linked to neurological and developmental disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular and developmental integrity (Chen2022The; Haren2020A; Kolbjer2021Lissencephaly).

## Structure
TUBGCP6 is a component of the γ-tubulin ring complex (γTuRC), essential for microtubule nucleation. The protein is characterized by specific structural domains and motifs that contribute to its function. The primary structure of TUBGCP6 includes extensive non-grip sequences in its N-terminal region and a domain connecting the grip1 and grip2 motifs. The N-terminal extension, particularly residues 280-352, is crucial for interactions with GCP4 and γTuSCs, and its deletion abolishes the ability of TUBGCP6 to rescue spindle bipolarity (Haren2020A).

The tertiary structure of TUBGCP6 involves a central insertion divided into three regions: a potential coiled-coil structure, an unstructured middle region phosphorylated by Plk4, and a third region with small helices, which is critical for γTuRC assembly (Haren2020A). The N-terminal region, including the first two α-helices, is important for actin binding, although actin is not necessary for the assembly or structural integrity of the γTuRC (Würtz2022Modular).

In terms of quaternary structure, TUBGCP6 forms a stable sub-complex with GCP4 and GCP5, which is essential for the assembly and stabilization of the γTuRC (Haren2020A). The protein's structure is conserved across species, indicating its evolutionary significance (Farache2018Assembly).

## Function
TUBGCP6 is a critical component of the γ-tubulin ring complex (γTuRC), which is essential for microtubule nucleation at the centrosome. This protein plays a significant role in organizing microtubules during cell division, ensuring proper chromosome segregation and mitotic spindle formation (Haren2020A). TUBGCP6, along with GCP4 and GCP5, forms a stable sub-complex that promotes the assembly and stabilization of γTuRCs, which are crucial for microtubule nucleation (Haren2020A). The N-terminal extension of GCP6 is particularly important for stabilizing interactions within the γTuRC, and its depletion leads to significant defects in γTuRC assembly and function (Haren2020A).

TUBGCP6 is widely expressed in human tissues, with the highest expression in brain tissues, suggesting its critical role in normal brain development and function (Chen2022The). It is involved in microtubule and mitosis-related functions, including microtubule nucleation, spindle organization, and the mitotic cell cycle, which are essential for cell division and structural organization within cells (Chen2022The). The gene's expression pattern and interactions indicate its importance in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of healthy human cells, particularly in the brain (Chen2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TUBGCP6 gene are associated with several neurological and developmental disorders, most notably microcephaly, a condition characterized by a smaller than normal brain size. This gene is crucial for normal brain development, and its mutations can lead to congenital microcephaly, often accompanied by other conditions such as chorioretinopathy, which affects the retina and can lead to visual impairments (Chen2022The; Kolbjer2021Lissencephaly). 

Patients with TUBGCP6 mutations may present with a range of symptoms, including simplified gyral patterns, pachygyria, and a hypoplastic cerebellar vermis. These mutations can also result in intellectual disabilities, motor retardation, and speech impairments (Kolbjer2021Lissencephaly). The gene's role in microtubule and mitosis-related processes is critical, and disruptions can lead to neuron deficiency and abnormal brain development (Chen2022The).

TUBGCP6 mutations have been implicated in lissencephaly, a condition characterized by a smooth brain surface due to abnormal neuronal migration, which can result in severe intellectual and motor disabilities (Kolbjer2021Lissencephaly). These findings underscore the gene's importance in neurodevelopment and its potential impact on various congenital disorders.

## Interactions
TUBGCP6 is a critical component of the γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC), which is essential for microtubule nucleation. It interacts with other gamma-tubulin complex proteins (GCPs), including GCP4 and GCP5, forming a stable sub-complex that is resistant to high salt concentrations. This sub-complex is crucial for the assembly of the full γ-TuRC, facilitating the incorporation of γ-tubulin small complexes (γ-TuSCs) into the larger γ-TuRC structure (Haren2020A). 

The GRIP1-NTE domain of TUBGCP6 plays a significant role in stabilizing the γ-TuRC by interacting with all γ-TuRC-specific GCP proteins, including GCP4 and GCP5. This domain is also involved in recruiting the MZT1-GCP3 module, contributing to the formation of the lumenal bridge within the complex (Würtz2022Modular). 

TUBGCP6 is also involved in interactions that affect the geometry and function of the γ-TuRC. Although actin is not required for the structural integrity of the γ-TuRC, its interaction with TUBGCP6 influences microtubule nucleation activity in vivo, highlighting the complexity of its role in cellular processes (Würtz2022Modular).
