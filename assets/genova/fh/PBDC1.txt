# PBDC1

## Overview
PBDC1, or polysaccharide biosynthesis domain containing 1, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is also referred to as CXorf26. The PBDC1 protein is implicated in cellular processes related to transcription and translation, potentially interacting with RNA polymerase II and ribosomes, thereby suggesting a role in protein synthesis regulation (Pavlíková2020Markers; Pavlikova2020Markers). Although the precise function of PBDC1 in healthy human cells remains largely unexplored, it is known to be downregulated in pancreatic beta-cells upon exposure to environmental toxins like p,p'-DDT, indicating its importance in maintaining normal protein synthesis levels (Pavlíková2020Markers; Pavlikova2020Markers). Additionally, PBDC1 is involved in phosphorylation events in reticulocytes, suggesting a potential role in cellular stress responses and deformation processes (Moura2019Reticulocyte). Further research is needed to elucidate the specific molecular activities and cellular localization of PBDC1 in healthy human cells.

## Structure


## Function
PBDC1, also known as CXorf26, is a protein with a predicted function related to RNA polymerase II and ribosomes, suggesting its involvement in transcription and translation processes. This indicates that PBDC1 may play a role in facilitating or regulating protein synthesis, although its precise function in healthy human cells remains largely unexplored (Pavlíková2020Markers; Pavlikova2020Markers). The protein is downregulated in pancreatic beta-cells upon exposure to p,p'-DDT, which could negatively impact protein synthesis, implying that PBDC1 might be crucial for maintaining normal protein synthesis levels in these cells (Pavlíková2020Markers; Pavlikova2020Markers).

In addition, PBDC1 has been identified in the context of phosphorylation events in reticulocytes, where it is associated with the phosphorylation sequence 'GADSGEEKEEGINR' at site 'S197'. This suggests a potential role in cellular processes related to cell deformation and stress responses, although specific details about its function in healthy cells are not provided (Moura2019Reticulocyte). Overall, while PBDC1 is implicated in important cellular processes, its exact molecular activities and cellular localization in healthy human cells require further investigation.
