# SIGLEC1

## Overview
SIGLEC1 is a gene that encodes the protein sialic acid binding Ig-like lectin 1, also known as sialoadhesin or CD169. This protein is a type I transmembrane receptor predominantly expressed on macrophages and plays a critical role in the immune system. The protein is characterized by an extracellular region with multiple immunoglobulin-like domains, which are essential for binding sialylated glycoconjugates, thereby mediating cell-cell interactions and immune surveillance (Lin2021Functions; Zaccai2003Structure-Guided). SIGLEC1 is involved in various immune processes, including antigen uptake and presentation, and is implicated in the modulation of inflammatory responses. Its expression is notably altered in several autoimmune diseases and viral infections, making it a potential biomarker for disease activity and immune response (Herzog2022Myeloid; Graf2022SIGLEC1).

## Structure
SIGLEC1, also known as sialoadhesin or CD169, is a type I transmembrane protein primarily expressed on macrophages. The protein structure includes an extracellular region with multiple immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail. The extracellular region is characterized by 17 immunoglobulin-like domains, with the N-terminal domain being crucial for sialic acid binding (Zaccai2003Structure-Guided). This domain specifically recognizes sialylated glycoconjugates through the binding of N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) (Zaccai2003Structure-Guided).

The primary structure of SIGLEC1 includes conserved residues such as Trp2, Arg97, and Trp106, which are important for binding interactions (Zaccai2003Structure-Guided). The tertiary structure of the N-terminal domain has been elucidated through crystallographic analysis, providing insights into the sialic acid recognition mechanism (Zaccai2003Structure-Guided).

Post-translational modifications of SIGLEC1 include glycosylation, which is common among members of the Siglec family. These modifications are essential for the protein's stability and function in cell-cell interactions and immune response modulation (Biesen2008Sialic). The detailed molecular structure of SIGLEC1, including its amino acid sequence and three-dimensional conformation, is not fully described in the available context.

## Function
Siglec-1, also known as sialoadhesin or CD169, is a protein primarily expressed on macrophages and plays a significant role in immune regulation and surveillance. In healthy human cells, Siglec-1 is involved in mediating cell-cell interactions and recognizing sialylated glycoproteins, which are crucial for antigen presentation and the clearance of apoptotic cells (Lin2021Functions). It binds to 2,3-linked sialylated glycans, which are specific sialylated ligands, and this interaction can suppress phagocytosis, attenuate inflammation, and inhibit damage- or pathogen-associated molecular pattern (DAMP/PAMP)-mediated inflammation (Lin2021Functions).

Siglec-1 is rapidly endocytosed upon ligation with its Neu5Ac a2,3 Gal ligands, highlighting its role in antigen uptake and processing for presentation to T cells, thereby facilitating immune activation (Lin2021Functions). This protein is primarily active in the endosomal and plasma membrane compartments of cells, where it contributes to immune surveillance and homeostasis (Lin2021Functions). The restricted expression of Siglec-1 to macrophages suggests its involvement in specific immune functions, such as the uptake and processing of antigens for presentation to the immune system (Lin2021Functions).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SIGLEC1 gene, also known as CD169, have been associated with various autoimmune diseases and viral infections. In idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, such as dermatomyositis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), SIGLEC1 is highly upregulated and serves as a biomarker for type I interferon activity, correlating with disease activity and treatment response (Graf2022SIGLEC1). In rheumatoid arthritis, SIGLEC1 expression is elevated on blood monocytes, distinguishing it as a potential biomarker for the disease (Lin2021Functions).

In the context of viral infections, SIGLEC1 expression is implicated in the immune response to pathogens. It is upregulated in mild COVID-19 cases, correlating with viral load, but not in severe cases, where interferon signaling may be impaired (Herzog2022Myeloid; Doehn2021CD169SIGLEC1). SIGLEC1 also plays a role in the pathogenesis of HIV and other viral infections by facilitating viral uptake and immune activation (Herzog2022Myeloid). In type 1 diabetes, a specific monocyte subpopulation characterized by SIGLEC1 expression has been identified, suggesting its involvement in the disease's pathogenesis (Guo2024A).

## Interactions
SIGLEC1, also known as sialoadhesin or CD169, is involved in several protein interactions that play a crucial role in modulating immune responses. SIGLEC1 interacts with the adaptor protein DAP12, which contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM). This interaction is enhanced during viral infections, such as those caused by vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or herpes simplex virus (HSV) (Zheng2015Siglec1). SIGLEC1 also associates with SHP2, a protein recruited to the SIGLEC1-DAP12 complex. SHP2 further recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM27, which is involved in the degradation of TBK1, a kinase that plays a role in antiviral responses. This interaction suppresses type I interferon (IFN) production, facilitating viral replication (Zheng2015Siglec1).

In the context of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) uptake by macrophages, SIGLEC1 interacts with the scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI). This interaction is crucial for the phagocytosis of oxLDL, although SIGLEC1 does not directly bind oxLDL itself (Xiong2013The). SIGLEC1 also binds to glycoproteins on regulatory T cells (Tregs) through glycan-dependent mechanisms, interacting with counter-receptors such as CD43 and PD-1 (Wu2021Activation).
