# IGFL3

## Overview
IGFL3, or Insulin-like Growth Factor Like Family Member 3, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, including growth and development. The protein encoded by IGFL3 is part of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) family, which is known for its role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Although the specific functions of IGFL3 are still being elucidated, it is categorized as a growth factor due to its structural and functional similarities to other members of the IGF family. Research has shown that IGFL3 is implicated in the regulation of signaling pathways associated with oncogenesis and cellular stress responses, highlighting its potential significance in both normal physiology and disease states (CarbajoGarcía2022Deciphering; Zhao2016The).

## Clinical Significance
IGFL3 (IGF like family member 3) has been implicated in various pathological conditions due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In uterine leiomyoma (UL), IGFL3 is upregulated through hyperacetylation of histone H3K27, which is associated with the dysregulation of the TGFβ3 signaling pathway. This dysregulation may contribute to the pathogenesis of UL by promoting cell proliferation and altering cell signaling pathways (CarbajoGarcía2022Deciphering). Although IGFL3 has not been previously linked to UL, its involvement in TGFβ signaling has been noted in other cancers, such as breast cancer, suggesting a broader role in oncogenic processes (CarbajoGarcía2022Deciphering).

Additionally, IGFL3 expression is influenced by the transcription factor ATF3, which collaborates with p53 in response to DNA damage. ATF3 is crucial for the proper transcriptional response to stressors, and its knockout impairs the expression of IGFL3, indicating that IGFL3 may play a role in the cellular response to DNA damage (Zhao2016The). These findings highlight the potential of IGFL3 as a target for therapeutic interventions in conditions where its expression is dysregulated.
