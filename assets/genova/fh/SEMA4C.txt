# SEMA4C

## Overview
SEMA4C is a gene that encodes the protein semaphorin 4C, a member of the semaphorin family known for its role in cell signaling. Semaphorin 4C is a transmembrane protein characterized by an extracellular Sema domain and an immunoglobulin-like domain, which are essential for its interactions with receptors such as Plexin-B2 (Xue2016Semaphorin; Rajabinejad2020Semaphorin). This protein is involved in various biological processes, including immune response modulation and neural development. In the immune system, semaphorin 4C is crucial for B-cell polarization and differentiation, while in the nervous system, it influences cerebellar development and neuronal architecture (Xue2016Semaphorin; Maier2011Semaphorin). Additionally, semaphorin 4C plays a role in cancer progression and inflammatory pain, highlighting its clinical significance in disease contexts (Paldy2017Semaphorin; Rajabinejad2020Semaphorin).

## Structure
SEMA4C, also known as semaphorin 4C, is a protein characterized by several distinct structural domains. The molecular structure of SEMA4C includes an extracellular Sema domain, which is a hallmark of the semaphorin family, and an immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain. These domains are crucial for its function in cell signaling and interaction with receptors such as Plexin-B2 (Xue2016Semaphorin; Rajabinejad2020Semaphorin). The protein also features a transmembrane region, which anchors it to the cell membrane, and a proline-rich intra-cytoplasmic domain, which may be involved in intracellular signaling pathways (Xue2016Semaphorin).

The tertiary structure of SEMA4C likely involves the folding of these domains into a three-dimensional conformation that facilitates its interaction with other proteins and receptors. Although specific details on the quaternary structure are not provided, semaphorins often function as dimers, suggesting that SEMA4C may also form dimeric structures. Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation could play a role in its stability and function, although specific modifications for SEMA4C are not detailed in the provided context. The presence of splice variants is common in semaphorins, potentially leading to different isoforms with distinct functional roles, although specific variants for SEMA4C are not mentioned in the context.

## Function
SEMA4C (semaphorin 4C) is a transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular and molecular processes. In the immune system, SEMA4C is involved in B-cell polarization, particularly under Th2-driven immune responses. It is specifically induced in B-cells following Th2 cytokine-mediated activation, which is essential for normal B-cell differentiation and the formation of synapse-like structures. This process is critical for the organization of B-cell follicular structures and optimal antibody production (Xue2016Semaphorin).

SEMA4C interacts with Plexin-B2, a receptor important for neural development, and this interaction is significant in both immune and neural contexts. In the nervous system, SEMA4C is involved in cerebellar development by promoting the migration of granule cell precursors, which is crucial for proper neural tube closure and cerebellar granule cell development (Maier2011Semaphorin). It also influences neuronal architecture by increasing dendritic complexity and spine density in hippocampal neurons, which is mediated through the Plexin-B-RhoA-ROCK signaling pathway (Simonetti2019The).

Overall, SEMA4C is integral to both immune and neural functions, affecting cell polarization, synapse formation, and structural plasticity, which are vital for effective immune responses and neural development.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SEMA4C gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of immune-related disorders, SEMA4C expression is notably decreased in patients with Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID), a condition characterized by impaired immunoglobulin production. This deficiency in SEMA4C is associated with reduced B-cell polarization and impaired immunoglobulin production, suggesting a role in the diminished immune response observed in CVID patients (Xue2016Semaphorin).

In cancer, high levels of soluble SEMA4C have been observed in breast and cervical cancer patients, where it promotes lymphatic metastasis and is associated with poor prognosis. SEMA4C contributes to resistance to estrogen deprivation and promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and chemotherapy resistance in breast cancer (Rajabinejad2020Semaphorin). Knockdown of SEMA4C or its receptor Plexin-B2 has been shown to inhibit growth in mammary carcinoma cells, indicating its role in cancer cell growth and metastasis (Rajabinejad2020Semaphorin).

SEMA4C is also involved in inflammatory pain, where its interaction with Plexin-B2 in peripheral sensory neurons contributes to persistent inflammatory hypersensitivity. This signaling pathway is suggested to play a role in chronic pain conditions, including cancer pain (Paldy2017Semaphorin).

## Interactions
SEMA4C interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It binds with high affinity to Plexin-B2, which is crucial for its function in immune responses and neuronal signaling. This interaction is important for the polarization of B cells and the migration of Tfh cells to the germinal center, affecting plasma cell development and antibody responses (Rajabinejad2020Semaphorin).

In the context of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), SEMA4C interacts with Erbin. This interaction has been shown to inhibit SEMA4C-induced EMT in HK2 cells. Erbin co-expression with SEMA4C increases E-cadherin levels and decreases vimentin levels, counteracting the EMT process. Knockdown of Erbin enhances SEMA4C-induced EMT, highlighting Erbin's inhibitory role (Zhou2013Erbin).

SEMA4C is also involved in cancer progression, where it is targeted by microRNAs such as miR-25-3p. In cervical cancer cells, downregulation of miR-25-3p leads to increased SEMA4C levels, promoting EMT and contributing to cisplatin resistance. Restoration of miR-25-3p reduces EMT features by suppressing SEMA4C, indicating its role in chemoresistance (Masadah2021The).
