# TMEM115

## Overview
TMEM115 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 115, a member of the rhomboid-like superfamily, which includes both active proteases and inactive pseudoproteases. This protein is characterized by its localization in the Golgi apparatus, where it plays a critical role in the retrograde transport pathway from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). TMEM115 is involved in maintaining proper glycosylation and interacts with key proteins such as the coat complex COPI and the conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex, highlighting its importance in vesicular trafficking and Golgi function (Ong2014TMEM115; Climer2018Membrane). The protein's structure includes multiple transmembrane domains and a cytosolic C-terminal tail, which are essential for its function and interactions within the cell (Lemberg2016Inactive). TMEM115 has been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer, where its expression levels are altered, suggesting a potential role as a tumor suppressor or in cancer progression, depending on the context (Ong2014TMEM115; Ivanov2008Genomic).

## Structure
TMEM115 is a human polytopic transmembrane protein that is part of the rhomboid-like superfamily, which includes both active proteases and inactive pseudoproteases. It is characterized by multiple transmembrane domains, specifically four N-terminal transmembrane domains (TMDs) (Adrain2012New; Climer2018Membrane). TMEM115 is a Golgi-localized rhomboid pseudoprotease, suggesting it shares structural features with active rhomboid proteases, such as the six-transmembrane rhomboid fold, although high-resolution structures are not yet available (Lemberg2016Inactive). 

The protein's N- and C-termini face the cytoplasm, and it contains a Golgi localization sequence, which is crucial for its function in the Golgi apparatus (Fasimoye2022GolgiIP). TMEM115 interacts with the Conserved Oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex, playing a role in vesicular trafficking and Golgi function (Climer2018Membrane). 

While specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of TMEM115 are not provided, it is known to undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which may influence its function and localization within the cell (Lemberg2016Inactive).

## Function
TMEM115 is an integral membrane protein localized in the Golgi apparatus, specifically within the medial and trans-Golgi cisternae. It plays a crucial role in the retrograde transport pathway from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), interacting with key proteins such as the coat complex COPI and the conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex (Ong2014TMEM115). TMEM115 is involved in maintaining proper glycosylation, particularly O-linked glycosylation, as its silencing leads to altered glycosylation profiles and reduced labeling of PNA-binding glycans (Ong2014TMEM115).

The protein contains four transmembrane domains and a cytosolic C-terminal tail, which interacts with cytosolic proteins involved in retrograde transport (Ong2014TMEM115). TMEM115 can self-oligomerize through its N-terminal domain and has a Golgi-targeting signal within residues 206-229, essential for its localization (Ong2014TMEM115). Its interaction with the COG complex, particularly COG4, suggests a role in the organization and function of the Golgi apparatus (Ong2014TMEM115). TMEM115's involvement in these processes is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper protein processing in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
TMEM115 has been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer. Alterations in the expression levels of TMEM115 have been observed in different cancer types, suggesting its potential role as a tumor suppressor. In pleural malignant mesothelioma, TMEM115, also known as PL6, is consistently downregulated at the mRNA level, indicating its involvement in the early stages of this cancer (Ivanov2008Genomic). Similarly, reduced expression of TMEM115 has been reported in renal clear cell carcinomas and other VHL-deficient tumors, supporting its potential tumor suppressor function (Ong2014TMEM115).

In contrast, higher expression levels of TMEM115 have been noted in invasive breast cancer cells, suggesting a complex, possibly cell type-specific role in cancer progression (Ong2014TMEM115). The study of TMEM115's interactions with the COG complex and its involvement in glycosylation processes further highlights its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis, with potential implications for diseases characterized by glycosylation defects (Ong2014TMEM115). While the exact clinical significance of TMEM115 mutations remains to be fully elucidated, its altered expression and interactions in various cancers underscore its potential as a target for further research and therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
TMEM115 is known to interact with several proteins involved in Golgi-to-ER retrograde transport. It interacts with the conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex, particularly showing a strong affinity for COG4, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation assays (Ong2014TMEM115). TMEM115 can co-immunoprecipitate with all eight COG subunits, indicating its role as an interacting partner of the COG tethering complex (Ong2014TMEM115). The C-terminal domain of TMEM115 is crucial for these interactions, as it can bind to COG3 and b-COP, another key player in retrograde transport (Ong2014TMEM115).

TMEM115 also has the ability to self-oligomerize through its N-terminal domain, forming dimers or oligomers, which may be important for its function in the Golgi apparatus (Ong2014TMEM115). The protein's interaction with b-COP and the COG complex suggests that TMEM115 is involved in COG-dependent transport pathways, as its depletion results in phenotypes similar to cells deficient in COG proteins (Ong2014TMEM115). These interactions highlight TMEM115's role in maintaining Golgi integrity and facilitating efficient retrograde transport.
