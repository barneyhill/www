# CAPN7

## Overview
CAPN7 is a gene that encodes the protein calpain 7, a non-classical member of the calpain family of cysteine proteases. Unlike typical calpains, calpain 7 lacks the penta-EF-hand domain, which is usually involved in calcium binding, and instead features unique structural elements such as tandem microtubule-interacting and trafficking (MIT) domains and a calpain-like cysteine protease domain. These structural characteristics enable calpain 7 to interact with components of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT), playing a crucial role in cellular processes such as cytokinesis and endosomal trafficking. Calpain 7 is involved in the degradation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and is essential for the regulation of cell division, particularly during the abscission phase. Its ubiquitous expression across human tissues suggests a fundamental role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and signaling pathways (Maemoto2014Involvement; Osako2010Autolytic; Paine2022The).

## Structure
Calpain 7 (CAPN7) is an atypical member of the calpain family, characterized by its unique domain structure. Unlike classical calpains, CAPN7 lacks the penta-EF-hand (PEF) domain, which is typically involved in calcium binding. Instead, it contains two tandem microtubule-interacting and trafficking (MIT) domains at its N-terminus, a calpain-like cysteine protease domain with a catalytic cysteine residue (Cys290), and a C2-like domain at its C-terminus (Yorikawa2008Human; Osako2010Autolytic; Maki2020Structures).

The MIT domains are crucial for interactions with endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-III-related proteins, such as IST1 and CHMP1B, facilitating CAPN7's role in endosomal trafficking (Yorikawa2008Human; Maemoto2011Calpain7). The protease domain of CAPN7 is distinct in that it lacks the typical His/Asn residues found in other calpains, which are usually part of the catalytic triad (Maki2020Structures).

CAPN7 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, suggesting a fundamental role in cellular processes, although its specific substrates and detailed molecular mechanisms remain largely unidentified (Osako2010Autolytic). The protein's structure and interactions suggest it plays a significant role in the degradation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) via the endosomal sorting pathway (Maemoto2014Involvement).

## Function
CAPN7, or calpain 7, is a non-classical cysteine protease involved in several critical cellular processes. It plays a significant role in cytokinesis, particularly in the abscission phase, where it functions alongside the ESCRT-III protein IST1 at the midbody to regulate the timing and completion of cell division. The proteolytic activity of CAPN7 is essential for efficient abscission and the maintenance of the NoCut checkpoint, which ensures that cell division is delayed in response to mitotic errors (Paine2022The).

CAPN7 is also involved in the degradation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) via the endosomal sorting pathway. Its activity accelerates EGFR degradation, a process crucial for cellular signaling and homeostasis. The interaction between CAPN7's MIT domains and ESCRT proteins, particularly IST1, is essential for its function in this pathway (Maemoto2014Involvement).

In addition to its roles in cytokinesis and receptor degradation, CAPN7 is implicated in membrane trafficking and endosomal sorting, interacting with ESCRT-III-related proteins such as CHMP1B. This interaction suggests a broader role in endosomal membrane dynamics (Yorikawa2008Human; Osako2010Autolytic).

## Interactions
Calpain 7 (CAPN7) is known to interact with several proteins, particularly those related to the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) system. CAPN7 contains tandem microtubule-interacting and trafficking (MIT) domains that facilitate its interaction with ESCRT-III and ESCRT-III-related proteins, such as charged multivesicular body protein 1 (CHMP1B) and increased sodium tolerance 1 (IST1) (Maemoto2014Involvement; Yorikawa2008Human). The interaction with IST1 is crucial for CAPN7's role in processes like cytokinetic abscission and the maintenance of the NoCut checkpoint during cell division (Paine2023The).

CAPN7 forms a ternary complex with CHMP1B and IST1, where IST1 enhances the interaction between CAPN7 and CHMP1B by acting as an adaptor (Maemoto2011Calpain7). This interaction is mediated through the MIT domains of CAPN7 binding to the MIT-interacting motifs (MIMs) of IST1, which is essential for CAPN7's recruitment to midbodies during cell division (Paine2023The). The presence of IST1 is also necessary for the proper localization of CAPN7 to EGFR-positive endosomes, indicating its role in the endosomal sorting pathway (Maemoto2014Involvement).

CAPN7's interactions with these proteins suggest its involvement in membrane trafficking, endosomal sorting, and cell division processes (Yorikawa2008Human).
