# GSDMA

## Overview
GSDMA is a gene that encodes the protein gasdermin A, a member of the gasdermin family known for its role in cell death and immune responses. Gasdermin A is characterized by its two-domain structure, comprising an N-terminal pore-forming domain and a C-terminal repression domain, which together facilitate its function in pyroptosis, a form of proinflammatory cell death (Symmank2022Suicide; LaRock2022Group). The gene is predominantly expressed in epithelial cells of the upper gastrointestinal tract and skin, where it contributes to cellular homeostasis and acts as a tumor suppressor (Weindel2023Gasdermins; Saeki2008Distinctive). GSDMA's activity is regulated by proteolytic cleavage and interactions with specific lipids, which are crucial for its pore-forming ability and subsequent immune defense mechanisms (Weindel2023Gasdermins; Ruan2018Cryo-EM). Alterations in GSDMA expression and function have been linked to various diseases, including autoimmune disorders and cancers, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for disease susceptibility and progression (Mu2022A; MorenoMoral2018Changes).

## Structure
The GSDMA protein is characterized by a two-domain structure, consisting of an N-terminal pore-forming domain and a C-terminal repression domain. The N-terminal domain is responsible for forming membrane pores, a critical function in the process of pyroptosis. This domain can oligomerize and bind to specific lipids, such as cardiolipin, facilitating its insertion into the membrane to form lytic pores (Symmank2022Suicide; LaRock2022Group). The C-terminal domain acts as an autoinhibitory region, preventing the N-terminal domain from forming pores until it is cleaved by specific proteases, such as the SpeB protease from Group A Streptococcus (LaRock2022Group).

The GSDMA protein undergoes significant conformational changes upon activation, particularly in the N-terminal domain, which is crucial for its interaction with acidic lipids. The α1 helix within this domain is a major site for lipid binding, containing basic residues that interact with the lipid membrane (Ruan2018Cryo-EM). Mutations in these residues can affect the protein's ability to form pores and disrupt membranes, highlighting their importance in the protein's function (Ruan2018Cryo-EM). The structural changes and interactions of GSDMA are essential for its role in immune defense and cell death processes.

## Function
GSDMA, a member of the gasdermin family, is primarily expressed in differentiated cells of the upper gastrointestinal tract, including the esophagus and stomach, as well as in skin epithelial cells (Weindel2023Gasdermins; Saeki2008Distinctive). In healthy human cells, GSDMA is involved in maintaining normal cell growth and differentiation, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract, where it functions as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cell growth through apoptosis induction (Saeki2008Distinctive). 

GSDMA is also implicated in the regulation of cellular homeostasis and immune responses. It can form pores in the plasma membrane, a process traditionally associated with pyroptosis, a form of proinflammatory cell death. However, GSDMA may also participate in other cell death pathways, such as apoptosis and necroptosis, and regulate cellular homeostasis independently of cell death (Weindel2023Gasdermins). 

In the context of host-pathogen interactions, GSDMA can be cleaved by bacterial enzymes, suggesting a role in immune defense mechanisms (Weindel2023Gasdermins). Its expression and activity are tightly regulated, with DNA methylation playing a significant role in controlling its expression in epithelial cells (Moussette2017Role).

## Clinical Significance
The GSDMA gene has been implicated in several diseases due to mutations and alterations in its expression. In systemic sclerosis (SSc), GSDMA is upregulated in monocyte-derived macrophages, contributing to disease susceptibility. This upregulation is associated with the rs3894194 risk variant, suggesting a role in the genetic predisposition to SSc (MorenoMoral2018Changes). GSDMA is also linked to various autoimmune diseases, including asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease, with genetic variants at the GSDMA locus contributing to these conditions (MorenoMoral2018Changes).

In cancer, GSDMA exhibits genomic alterations across multiple types, with mutations and copy number alterations being prevalent. It is particularly associated with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, uterine mixed endometrial carcinoma, and cutaneous melanoma (Mu2022A). In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), GSDMA expression is positively correlated with immune cell infiltration, and its DNA methylation levels are lower in tumor samples, indicating a potential role in tumor progression and immune response (Yao2022GSDMs). These findings suggest that GSDMA may serve as a biomarker for disease susceptibility and progression in both autoimmune and cancerous conditions.

## Interactions
GSDMA interacts with the protease virulence factor SpeB secreted by Group A Streptococcus (GAS). SpeB cleaves GSDMA, releasing an active N-terminal fragment that can insert into cell membranes to form lytic pores, leading to pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death. This interaction is crucial for the immune defense against GAS infections, particularly in keratinocytes, where GSDMA is highly expressed (LaRock2022Group). 

GSDMA also interacts with phospholipids, showing a strong affinity for phosphorylated phosphatidylinositol (PI) and cardiolipin (CL). These interactions are important for the regulation of cellular homeostasis and influence ion gradients and cellular responses to stress. The binding of GSDMA to phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI(4)P), phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), and cardiolipin (CL) is crucial for its pore-forming activity in the plasma membrane (Weindel2023Gasdermins).

In the context of systemic sclerosis (SSc), GSDMA is differentially expressed and cis-regulated in monocyte-derived macrophages, suggesting its involvement in macrophage-related autoimmune processes. However, specific protein interactions involving GSDMA in this context are not detailed (MorenoMoral2018Changes).
