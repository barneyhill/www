# NR1H3

## Overview
The NR1H3 gene encodes the nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group H member 3, commonly known as Liver X Receptor Alpha (LXRα), which is a nuclear receptor involved in the regulation of cholesterol, fatty acid, and glucose homeostasis. As a transcription factor, LXRα forms heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXRs) to modulate the expression of genes critical for lipid metabolism and inflammatory responses (HenryBerger2008Endoglin). The protein structure of LXRα includes a DNA-binding domain with zinc finger motifs and a ligand-binding domain that accommodates a variety of ligands, including hydroxylated cholesterol metabolites (Zhang2004Genomic; Benoit2004Digging). LXRα plays a pivotal role in maintaining cholesterol balance in the liver by regulating enzymes involved in bile acid synthesis and cholesterol catabolism (Peet1998Cholesterol). Additionally, it is implicated in the differentiation of hepatocyte-like cells and has been associated with various diseases, including multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease, due to its influence on lipid metabolism and immune responses (VilariñoGüell2021Transcriptome; Chen2014Liver).

## Structure
The NR1H3 gene encodes the Liver X Receptor Alpha (LXRα), a nuclear receptor involved in cholesterol homeostasis. The protein structure includes a DNA-binding domain (DBD) characterized by zinc finger motifs, which are highly conserved across nuclear receptors (Zhang2004Genomic). The ligand-binding domain (LBD) of NR1H3 features a canonical fold composed of 10-13 alpha-helices and 2-5 beta-strands, forming a pocket for ligand accommodation (Benoit2004Digging). This domain is crucial for the receptor's ability to transition between inactive and active states upon ligand binding, facilitated by the activation function (AF)-2 helix (Benoit2004Digging).

NR1H3 forms heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXRs) to bind DNA and regulate gene expression (Li2021Structural). The ligand-binding pocket of LXRα is relatively large, allowing it to bind a diverse range of ligands, including hydroxylated cholesterol metabolites, with relatively low affinity (Benoit2004Digging). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation can influence the activity and stability of LXRα, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context. Splice variants of NR1H3 may exist, potentially affecting its functional domains and regulatory roles (Li2021Structural).

## Function
The NR1H3 gene encodes the Liver X Receptor Alpha (LXRα), a nuclear receptor that plays a crucial role in regulating cholesterol, fatty acid, and glucose homeostasis. LXRα functions as a transcription factor, forming heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXRs) to bind to liver-X-responsive elements (LXREs) in the DNA, thereby activating the expression of target genes involved in lipid metabolism and inflammation (HenryBerger2008Endoglin). 

In the liver, LXRα is essential for maintaining cholesterol balance by regulating the transcription of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (Cyp7a), the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid synthesis. This regulation is crucial for the catabolism and excretion of excess cholesterol, particularly in response to high dietary cholesterol intake (Peet1998Cholesterol). LXRα also influences the expression of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and catabolism, acting as a cholesterol sensor to maintain low hepatic cholesterol concentrations (Peet1998Cholesterol).

In addition to its role in cholesterol metabolism, LXRα is involved in the differentiation of hepatocyte-like cells. Overexpression of NR1H3 in HepaRG progenitor cells enhances hepatic gene expression, promoting differentiation into functional hepatocytes with increased glycogen storage, urea production, and cytochrome P450 enzyme activity (Chen2014Liver). This highlights its importance in liver development and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NR1H3 gene, which encodes the liver X receptor alpha (LXRα), have been implicated in several diseases. In multiple sclerosis (MS), particularly primary progressive MS (PPMS), a specific mutation, p.Arg415Gln, has been identified. This mutation impairs the dimerization of LXRα with retinoid X receptors, leading to dysregulation of transcriptional activity and contributing to a pro-inflammatory phenotype and dysregulated lipid metabolism, which are characteristic of MS (VilariñoGüell2021Transcriptome). A mouse model with a homologous mutation (p.Arg413Gln) has shown similar dysregulation, providing insights into the disease's progression and potential therapeutic targets (VilariñoGüell2021Transcriptome).

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), genetic variations in NR1H3, such as the rs7120118 polymorphism, have been associated with altered expression of LXRα and its downstream targets, potentially influencing disease progression. The CC genotype of this polymorphism is linked to decreased levels of soluble amyloid-beta 42, suggesting a protective effect against AD (Natunen2013Effects).

Additionally, NR1H3 polymorphisms have been associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in a Korean population. Specific promoter polymorphisms, such as -1830 T > C, have been linked to altered transcriptional activity and various SLE phenotypes, including arthritis and oral ulcers (Jeon2014Liver).

## Interactions
NR1H3, also known as Liver X Receptor Alpha (LXRα), is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function as a nuclear receptor. It forms heterodimers with the Retinoid X Receptor (RXR) to regulate gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences (Geronikolou2018Interspecies). NR1H3 interacts with the nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (NCOR1), which serves as a major hub for interactions among nuclear receptors, including the glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1 and the estrogen-related receptor (ERR) (Geronikolou2018Interspecies). 

In the context of breast cancer, NR1H3 is associated with macrophage infiltration and immune cell activation, interacting with various immune cells such as B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, neutrophils, and dendritic cells (Zhang2023Low). The gene interaction network of NR1H3 includes functions related to phagocytosis, toll-like receptor signaling, and immune response regulation (Zhang2023Low). 

NR1H3 also interacts with SHP (NR0B2), a co-repressor hub in negative feedback loops, which suppresses the activating effects of NR1H3 when they form functional dimers or monomers (Amoutzias2007A). These interactions highlight NR1H3's role in transcription regulation and its involvement in complex signaling pathways.
