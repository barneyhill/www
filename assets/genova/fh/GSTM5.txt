# GSTM5

## Overview
GSTM5, or glutathione S-transferase mu 5, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the glutathione S-transferase (GST) family, specifically the mu class. This family of enzymes is integral to cellular detoxification processes, where they catalyze the conjugation of glutathione to a variety of electrophilic compounds, aiding in their neutralization and excretion. The GSTM5 protein is characterized by its ability to form dimers, a common structural feature among GSTs, which enhances its functional capacity in detoxification. It is primarily active in the cytoplasm and plays a role in protecting cells from oxidative stress and damage caused by reactive oxygen species and xenobiotics (Board2013Glutathione; Listowsky1998Human). While GSTM5 is expressed at low levels across various tissues, its involvement in detoxification underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Listowsky1998Human). The gene's expression and regulation have significant implications in cancer biology, where it may act as either a tumor suppressor or an oncogene, depending on the cancer type and cellular context (Zhang2022Comprehensive; Hao2022Aberrant).

## Structure
The GSTM5 protein is part of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) family, which is involved in detoxification processes. The primary structure of GSTM5 consists of amino acid sequences specific to the mu class of GSTs (Jou2021AntiCancer). The secondary structure typically includes alpha helices and beta sheets, forming a characteristic GST fold (Oakley2023Hidden). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a three-dimensional shape, which is common among GSTs (Oakley2023Hidden). 

GSTM5 proteins often form dimers, which is a typical quaternary structure for GSTs, allowing them to function effectively in their role of catalyzing the conjugation of glutathione to various substrates (Oakley2023Hidden). The protein contains an N-terminal domain with a thioredoxin-like βαβαββα topology and a unique C-terminal domain composed of α-helixes. The N-terminal domain includes the 'G-site' for glutathione binding and the 'H-site' for hydrophobic co-substrates (Oakley2023Hidden). 

Post-translational modifications of GSTM5 may include phosphorylation and acetylation, which can affect its activity and stability. Splice variants of GSTM5 may exist, leading to different isoforms with potential functional diversity (Jou2021AntiCancer).

## Function
GSTM5 (glutathione S-transferase mu 5) is a member of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) family, which plays a crucial role in cellular detoxification processes. These enzymes catalyze the conjugation of glutathione to a variety of electrophilic compounds, facilitating their neutralization and subsequent excretion from the cell. This activity is essential for protecting cells against oxidative stress and damage from reactive oxygen species and xenobiotics (Board2013Glutathione).

GSTM5 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the cellular antioxidant defense system. Although specific functions of GSTM5 in healthy cells are not extensively detailed, it is known to be involved in the general GST-mediated detoxification processes. The enzyme's activity helps maintain cellular homeostasis by preventing the accumulation of harmful substances that can lead to cellular damage and disease (Listowsky1998Human).

In the context of tissue-specific expression, GSTM5 is found at low levels across various tissues, indicating a potentially specialized or supportive role in conjunction with other GST subunits (Listowsky1998Human). Despite its low abundance, GSTM5's contribution to the detoxification pathway underscores its importance in cellular protection mechanisms.

## Clinical Significance
The GSTM5 gene is implicated in various cancers, with its expression levels playing a significant role in disease prognosis and progression. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), GSTM5 expression is notably decreased compared to non-cancerous tissues, and this reduction is linked to poor prognosis. The down-regulation is associated with hypermethylation of the GSTM5 promoter region, which can be reversed by the methylation inhibitor 5-Aza-CdR, restoring gene expression and reducing cancer cell proliferation and migration (Hao2022Aberrant). In bladder cancer, GSTM5 is also down-regulated, and its overexpression has been shown to decrease cell proliferation and migration, suggesting a tumor suppressor role (Hao2022Aberrant).

Conversely, in colon cancer, GSTM5 is up-regulated, and its dysregulation is associated with poor survival outcomes (Hao2022Aberrant). In gastric cancer, high GSTM5 expression correlates with a worse prognosis (Hao2022Aberrant). The gene's expression is also decreased in ovarian cancer, where it is positively correlated with prognosis and associated with the ovarian cancer stemness index (Zhang2022Comprehensive). These findings suggest that GSTM5 may function as a tumor suppressor in some cancers and as an oncogene in others, depending on the cellular environment and cancer type.
