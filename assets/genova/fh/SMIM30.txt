# SMIM30

## Overview
SMIM30 is a gene that encodes the small integral membrane protein 30, a transmembrane protein involved in cellular signaling pathways. This protein is characterized by its small size and hydrophobic nature, with two transmembrane domains that facilitate its integration into cellular membranes. SMIM30 plays a crucial role in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by interacting with non-receptor tyrosine kinases such as SRC and YES1, thereby influencing their membrane localization and activation. These interactions are pivotal for the activation of the MAPK signaling pathway, which is essential for cell proliferation and migration. The expression of SMIM30 is regulated by the transcription factor c-Myc and is notably higher in cancerous tissues, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention and a prognostic marker in HCC (Pang2020Peptide).

## Structure
The SMIM30 protein, encoded by the LINC00998 gene, is a small endogenous peptide with a primary structure consisting of 59 amino acids (Pang2020Peptide). Its secondary structure is predominantly alpha-helical, with 66.10% of the peptide forming alpha helices, 13.56% forming beta sheets, 10.17% forming turns, and 10.17% forming random coils (Pang2020Peptide). The peptide is predicted to have two transmembrane domains, with transmembrane helices located at amino acids 7-25 and 30-52, forming a type II single-pass transmembrane alpha helix (Pang2020Peptide). 

The SMIM30 peptide is highly hydrophobic, with a maximum hydrophobicity score of 3.278 at the 35th residue (Leu) and a minimum score of -1.989 at the 55th residue (Arg) (Pang2020Peptide). Signal peptide sites have been identified at Val 25 and Gly 28, indicating potential post-translational modifications that may influence its function and localization (Pang2020Peptide). The peptide's role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) involves interactions with SRC and YES1 kinases, suggesting its involvement in membrane anchoring and signaling pathways (Pang2020Peptide).

## Clinical Significance
SMIM30, encoded by the LINC00998 gene, plays a significant role in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It is highly expressed in HCC tissues and is associated with advanced clinical stages and poorer prognoses (Pang2020Peptide). Alterations in SMIM30 expression are linked to increased tumorigenic properties, including enhanced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Pang2020Peptide). Knockdown of SMIM30 in HCC cells results in reduced tumor growth and metastasis, indicating its critical role in cancer progression (Pang2020Peptide).

SMIM30 influences the MAPK signaling pathway, a key pathway involved in cell proliferation and survival, by interacting with non-receptor tyrosine kinases SRC and YES1. This interaction facilitates the membrane localization and activation of these kinases, which is essential for their role in carcinogenesis (Pang2020Peptide). The transcription of SMIM30 is regulated by c-Myc, and its expression is significantly higher in cancerous tissues compared to non-cancerous ones (Pang2020Peptide).

Given its role in HCC, SMIM30 is considered a potential target for therapeutic intervention and a prognostic indicator for patient outcomes (Pang2020Peptide).

## Interactions
SMIM30, encoded by the LINC00998 gene, is a small integral membrane protein that plays a significant role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression through its interactions with other proteins. SMIM30 interacts with non-receptor tyrosine kinases SRC and YES1, facilitating their membrane localization and activation. This interaction is crucial for the transformative activity of SRC/YES1 in both normal and tumorigenic processes. The interaction between SMIM30 and SRC/YES1 is RNA-independent and involves the N-terminal membrane association domain of SRC/YES1 (Pang2020Peptide).

SMIM30 also acts as an adaptor, promoting the binding of SRC/YES1 to integrin β1, which is essential for the activation of the MAPK signaling pathway. This pathway includes components such as ERK and p38, whose phosphorylation levels are altered by SMIM30 knockdown (Pang2020Peptide). The interaction with SRC/YES1 and integrin β1 highlights SMIM30's role in modulating cell proliferation and migration, contributing to HCC development (Pang2020Peptide).

Additionally, SMIM30's interaction with SRC/YES1 involves lipid-mediated hetero-dimerization/oligomerization, similar to motifs found in other proteins like K-Ras isoform 2B, which form nanoclusters through electrostatic interactions with negatively charged lipids (Mohammad2022Lipidmediated).
