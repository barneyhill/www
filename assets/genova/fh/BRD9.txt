# BRD9

## Overview
BRD9 is a gene that encodes the protein bromodomain containing 9, which is a member of the bromodomain family of proteins. This protein is characterized by its single bromodomain, a conserved motif that recognizes acetylated lysine residues on histone tails, playing a crucial role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation (De2021Insights). As a component of the non-canonical SWI/SNF (ncBAF) chromatin remodeling complex, BRD9 is involved in various cellular processes, including stem cell maintenance and differentiation, DNA repair, and transcriptional regulation (Wang2023BRD9-mediated; Zhou2020The). Its interactions with other proteins and transcription factors underscore its multifaceted role in cellular function and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer (Del2019BRD9; Wang2019BRD9).

## Structure
BRD9 is a protein that contains a single bromodomain, which is a conserved motif involved in recognizing acetylated lysine residues on histone tails. This domain is crucial for influencing chromatin structure and gene expression (De2021Insights). The bromodomain of BRD9 is composed of four antiparallel left-handed α-helices (αA, αZ, αB, and αC) and two loops (ZA and BC) that connect these helices. These structural elements are essential for the protein's ability to undergo conformational changes upon ligand interaction, particularly affecting the side chains of Phe44, Phe47, and Tyr106 (De2021Insights).

BRD9 is part of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, indicating its involvement in quaternary interactions within this complex (De2021Insights). The protein's structure allows for significant induced-fit pocket plasticity, which is evident in its ability to accommodate various ligands through structural rearrangements, such as the rotation of side chains like Phe47 (Picaud20159HPurine). This plasticity is not observed in closely related proteins like BRD4, highlighting BRD9's specificity in ligand interactions (Picaud20159HPurine). The protein may also undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which could further influence its function and interactions.

## Function
BRD9 (bromodomain containing 9) is a critical component of the non-canonical SWI/SNF (ncBAF) chromatin remodeling complex, playing a significant role in regulating gene expression in human cells. In human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), BRD9 is essential for maintaining pluripotency and directing differentiation. It modulates the TGF-β/Activin/Nodal and Wnt signaling pathways, which are crucial for self-renewal and differentiation. BRD9 collaborates with proteins such as BRD4, SMAD2/3, and β-CATENIN to regulate the expression of pluripotency genes by controlling histone acetylation, specifically H3K27ac, at active promoters and enhancers (Wang2023BRD9-mediated).

In hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), BRD9 is vital for maintaining stem cell function and lineage differentiation. It supports megakaryocytic and erythroid differentiation while restraining myeloid differentiation. BRD9 influences the activity of the master hematopoietic regulator GATA1 through chromatin regulation, affecting gene expression necessary for hematopoiesis (Garg2024BRD9). The loss of BRD9 leads to transcriptional repression and altered chromatin accessibility, impacting the multilineage potential of HSPCs (Garg2024BRD9). Overall, BRD9 is crucial for maintaining the balance between stemness and differentiation in various stem cell types.

## Clinical Significance
BRD9 is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression and interactions. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), BRD9 is overexpressed, contributing to leukemic cell survival by sustaining STAT5 pathway activation. Targeting BRD9 in AML cells leads to apoptosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Del2019BRD9). In gallbladder cancer (GBC), elevated BRD9 expression is associated with poor prognosis and promotes tumor progression through the CST1/PI3K/AKT pathway. Inhibition of BRD9 reduces GBC cell proliferation, suggesting its role as a therapeutic target (Qiang2024BRD9).

BRD9 is also overexpressed in prostate cancer, where it interacts with the androgen receptor (AR) and modulates AR-dependent gene expression. This makes BRD9 a potential target for AR-positive prostate cancers, especially those resistant to current therapies (Alpsoy2021BRD9). In malignant rhabdoid tumors, BRD9 is essential for tumor cell survival, particularly in the absence of the SMARCB1 subunit, making it a specific vulnerability in these cancers (Wang2019BRD9).

Overall, BRD9's role in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target underscore its clinical significance across multiple cancer types.

## Interactions
BRD9 is a bromodomain-containing protein that plays a significant role in various protein interactions, particularly within the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. It is a core member of this complex and interacts with several proteins, including SMARCA4, SS18, SMARCD1, GLTSCR1, and GLTSCR1L, as confirmed through mass spectrometry and GFP pulldown assays (Del2019BRD9). BRD9 is also part of a distinct SWI/SNF subcomplex known as GBAF, which includes GLTSCR1 and is characterized by the absence of certain BAF and PBAF subunits (Wang2019BRD9).

In the context of DNA repair, BRD9 facilitates the formation of the RAD51-RAD54 complex, essential for homologous recombination. It binds to DNA damage-induced K515 acetylation on RAD54, promoting its interaction with RAD51 (Zhou2020The). This interaction is crucial for DNA double-strand break repair, highlighting BRD9's role in maintaining genomic stability (Zhou2020The).

BRD9 also interacts with transcription factors such as AP-1, CTCF, and members of the ETS family, suggesting its involvement in multiple transcriptional regulation pathways (Wang2019BRD9). These interactions underscore BRD9's multifaceted role in cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer.
