# SLC50A1

## Overview
SLC50A1 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 50 member 1, also known as SWEET1, which is a member of the SWEET class of glucose transporters. This protein is characterized by its unique structure, consisting of seven transmembrane segments, which facilitates its role as a glucose uniporter. SWEET1 is primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus and is involved in the transport of mono- and disaccharides across cellular membranes, playing a crucial role in glucose homeostasis and energy metabolism (Wright2013Glucose; Colas2016SLC). The gene's expression is significant in various tissues, including the oviduct, epididymis, and intestine, and it is implicated in metabolic processes related to reproduction and lactation (Głuchowska2021Expression). SLC50A1 has been associated with several clinical conditions, including early breast cancer and Parkinson's disease, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and its involvement in disease pathogenesis (Zhang2022Diagnostic; Booms2020Parkinson’s).

## Structure
The SLC50A1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the SWEET class of glucose uniporters, primarily involved in glucose transport. The protein is characterized by a unique structural fold consisting of 7 transmembrane segments (TMs), which distinguishes it from other glucose transporters that typically have different structural configurations (Colas2016SLC). This structural feature is significant as it facilitates the uniport mechanism of glucose transport across cell membranes.

In humans, SLC50A1 is a candidate for mediating glucose efflux from enterocytes and hepatocytes, suggesting its role in glucose homeostasis (Wright2013Glucose). While specific details about the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of the SLC50A1 protein are not provided, its classification as a glucose uniporter with a unique fold implies a specialized function in glucose transport.

The SLC50A1 protein is part of a single-member family in humans, indicating a specialized and possibly unique role compared to other glucose transporters, which often belong to larger families with multiple members and diverse functions (Wright2013Glucose). The protein's structure and function are crucial for understanding its role in glucose metabolism and potential implications in metabolic disorders.

## Function
SLC50A1 encodes the sugar transporter protein SWEET1, which is involved in the transport of mono- and disaccharides across cellular membranes. In humans, SWEET1 is primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus and plays a significant role in glucose homeostasis and energy metabolism. It is characterized by seven predicted transmembrane domains and is involved in the efflux of glucose from enterocytes and hepatocytes into the bloodstream, facilitating glucose transport in the body (Wright2013Glucose; Głuchowska2021Expression).

SWEET1 is expressed in various tissues, with the highest levels found in the oviduct, epididymis, and intestine. In the human mammary gland, SWEET1 is thought to supply glucose for lactose synthesis, highlighting its role in metabolic processes related to reproduction and lactation (Głuchowska2021Expression). The protein's activity in the basolateral membrane of enterocytes is particularly noted in patients with Fanconi Bickel Syndrome, where it may facilitate the exit of glucose from cells into the blood (Głuchowska2021Expression).

SLC50A1's function as a glucose transporter is crucial for maintaining cellular energy balance and supporting metabolic activities in various tissues, contributing to overall organismal glucose regulation (Zhang2022Diagnostic).

## Clinical Significance
The SLC50A1 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through its altered expression levels and potential genetic interactions. In early breast cancer (EBC), SLC50A1 expression is significantly elevated in both serum and tumor tissues compared to benign breast disease and healthy controls. This upregulation is associated with poorer overall survival rates, making SLC50A1 a potential biomarker for diagnosing and predicting the prognosis of EBC (Zhang2022Diagnostic). 

In Parkinson's disease (PD), SLC50A1 has been identified as a candidate gene through genome-wide association studies. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within the promoter region of SLC50A1, rs12726330, has shown a significant association with PD risk, suggesting that alterations in SLC50A1 expression may influence disease development (Booms2020Parkinson’s). However, rare variants in SLC50A1 have not shown a significant association with early-onset Parkinson's disease in a Chinese population, indicating that common variants may play a more substantial role in PD etiology (Li2021Mutation).

SLC50A1 is also upregulated in bladder cancers, suggesting a role in cancer metabolism and potential susceptibility to bladder cancer (Mingardo2022A). These findings highlight the gene's involvement in various cancers and neurodegenerative diseases, warranting further investigation into its clinical significance.

## Interactions
SLC50A1, a member of the solute carrier family, is involved in protein-protein interactions that are significant for its function. Notably, SLC50A1 interacts with EFNA1 and DPM3, as identified through gene fusions and co-expression patterns. These interactions were analyzed using the STRING database, which suggested a probable interaction between EFNA1 and SLC50A1, as well as between EFNA1 and DPM3. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) enrichment p-value for these interactions was 0.000205, indicating a significant association (Mingardo2022A).

In humans, SLC50A1 is found in the Golgi apparatus and is involved in weak glucose efflux, suggesting its role in exporting glucose from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol. This function is supported by its expression in the zebrafish proximal tubules, where it is speculated to efflux glucose (Sander2019Transcriptional). The gene is also associated with sugar transport in the large intestine, specifically in aldose transport, highlighting its role in nutrient absorption (Wang2019Singlecell). These interactions and functions suggest that SLC50A1 may participate in complex regulatory networks involving glucose transport and metabolism.
