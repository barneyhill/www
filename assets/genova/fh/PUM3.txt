# PUM3

## Overview
PUM3 is a gene that encodes the protein pumilio RNA binding family member 3, also known as PUF-A, which is a member of the Pumilio/fem-3 (PUF) RNA binding protein family. This protein is characterized by its multiple Pumilio (PUM) repeats, which enable it to bind RNA and play a crucial role in posttranscriptional regulation, including mRNA degradation and translational repression. PUF-A is primarily localized in the nucleolus, where it is involved in the nucleolar processing of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), particularly in the maturation of 7S to 5.8S rRNA, a critical step in ribosome biogenesis. The protein's function is modulated by phosphorylation, notably at the Y259 residue, which is essential for its stability and role in cell proliferation, especially under genotoxic stress conditions. PUM3's interactions with other proteins, such as nucleophosmin (NPM1) and PARP-1, further underscore its involvement in cellular processes related to ribosome assembly and the DNA damage response, with implications in tumorigenesis (Lin2021Phosphorylation; Najdrová2020The; Cho2022PufA).

## Structure
The PUM3 protein, also known as PUF-A, is a member of the Pumilio/fem-3 (PUF) RNA binding protein family. It contains 8-12 conserved α-helical Pumilio (PUM) repeats, each consisting of 35 to 39 amino acids, which are capable of associating with the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of target mRNAs to promote mRNA degradation and translational repression (Lin2021Phosphorylation). Structurally, PUF-A has an N-terminal region with three PUM repeats (N-R1 to N-R3, residues 131-277) flanked by an N-terminal pseudo-repeat (N-R1'). The C-terminal subdomain contains eight PUM repeats (C-R1 to C-R8, residues 278-646) and a C-terminal pseudo-repeat (C-R8') (Lin2021Phosphorylation).

The protein's nucleolar localization can redistribute to the nucleoplasm in response to genotoxic stress, and phosphorylation at Y259 is significant for PUF-A's stability and role in cell proliferation, particularly in tumorigenesis (Lin2021Phosphorylation). PUM3 proteins are involved in the nucleolar processing of the large subunit of the ribosome, potentially during the processing of 7S to 5.8S rRNA, and they bind double-stranded DNA or RNA without sequence specificity (Najdrová2020The). The protein is conserved across eukaryotes and is involved in core cellular processes such as rRNA maturation (Najdrová2020The).

## Function
PUM3, also known as PUF-A, is a protein involved in the nucleolar processing of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), specifically in the maturation of 7S to 5.8S rRNA, which is crucial for ribosome biogenesis. This process is essential for the assembly of the small ribosomal subunit, highlighting PUM3's role in maintaining efficient protein synthesis within cells (Lin2021Phosphorylation; Najdrová2020The). PUM3 predominantly localizes in the nucleolus, where it participates in rRNA maturation, but it can redistribute to the nucleoplasm in response to genotoxic stress (Lin2021Phosphorylation; Najdrová2020The).

The protein contains multiple PUM repeats that facilitate interactions with RNA elements, contributing to mRNA degradation and translational repression (Lin2021Phosphorylation). Phosphorylation of PUM3 at the Y259 residue is critical for its stability and function, particularly under conditions of cellular stress, and is necessary for cell proliferation (Lin2021Phosphorylation). This post-translational modification helps maintain PUM3's stability by preventing its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Lin2021Phosphorylation). PUM3's involvement in these molecular processes underscores its importance in cell biology and its potential implications in various cellular outcomes, including tumorigenesis (Lin2021Phosphorylation).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
PUM3, also known as Puf-A, is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. One of the primary interactions of PUM3 is with nucleophosmin (NPM1) in the nucleolus. This interaction is significant for ribosome biogenesis and cancer cell proliferation, as it affects the localization of ribosomal proteins and is associated with poor prognosis in cancers such as non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer (Cho2022PufA).

PUM3 also interacts with the catalytic domain of PARP-1, a protein involved in the DNA damage response. This interaction inhibits PARP-1's poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation activity, which may be linked to PUM3's role in tumorigenesis (Lin2021Phosphorylation). The phosphorylation of PUM3 at the Y259 residue is crucial for its stability and subcellular localization, particularly under genotoxic stress, indicating a regulatory mechanism for its function in cells (Lin2021Phosphorylation).

PUM3 is part of the Puf superfamily of RNA-binding proteins, which are involved in posttranscriptional regulation, such as mRNA turnover and rRNA maturation. PUM3 proteins are conserved across eukaryotes and are involved in the nucleolar processing of rRNA (Najdrová2020The).
