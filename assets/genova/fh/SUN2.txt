# SUN2

## Overview
SUN2 is a gene that encodes the protein Sad1 and UNC84 domain containing 2, which is a transmembrane protein integral to the structure and function of the nuclear envelope. The SUN2 protein is a key component of the LINC (Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton) complex, which facilitates the connection between the nuclear lamina and the cytoskeleton, playing a vital role in nuclear positioning, chromatin organization, and DNA repair processes (Krshnan2022Regulated; Schmitt2007Transmembrane). The protein is characterized by its conserved SUN domain, which is essential for its interaction with other nuclear envelope proteins and its function in maintaining nuclear architecture (Zhou2012Structure). Mutations in the SUN2 gene have been associated with various diseases, including muscular dystrophies and cardiomyopathies, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining cellular integrity and function (Meinke2014Muscular).

## Structure
The SUN2 protein is characterized by its conserved SUN domain, which plays a critical role in nuclear envelope organization and interaction with the cytoskeleton. The primary structure of SUN2 includes 731 amino acids, with three highly conserved cysteine residues that are crucial for its function and stability (Sharma2023Disulfide). The secondary structure of the SUN domain features a 'stalk' region with an α-helix and a 'leaflike' subdomain formed by a β-sheet sandwich. The α-helix is positioned at an angle to the β-sandwich, which consists of a three-stranded β-sheet (JDG) and a four-stranded β-sheet (CHEF) (Zhou2012Structure).

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a cloverleaf-like trimeric structure, which is crucial for its stability and function (Zhou2012Structure). The quaternary structure of SUN2 includes its ability to form a homotrimer, supported by size exclusion chromatography and SDS-PAGE analysis (Zhou2012Structure). This trimerization is essential for binding to the KASH domain, forming the LINC complex that links the nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton across the nuclear envelope (Zhou2012Structure).

Post-translational modifications, such as disulfide bond formation between cysteine residues, are important for SUN2's structural integrity and function. Specifically, the Cys615 and Cys719 residues form an intramolecular disulfide bridge essential for proper localization and turnover (Sharma2023Disulfide).

## Function
SUN2 (Sad1 and UNC84 domain containing 2) is a protein that plays a critical role in maintaining the architecture and function of the nuclear envelope in human cells. It is a component of the inner nuclear membrane and is involved in the LINC (Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton) complex, which is essential for coupling nuclear and cytoplasmic events. This complex is crucial for various cellular processes, including nuclear positioning, chromatin anchoring, and DNA repair (Krshnan2022Regulated).

SUN2 is involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks, where it influences the mobility of damaged DNA loci, thereby affecting repair efficiency. Non-degradable SUN2 has been shown to compromise DNA repair efficiency, leading to higher levels of DNA damage markers (Krshnan2022Regulated). The protein's regulated degradation is essential for maintaining nuclear envelope integrity and function, as its accumulation can lead to defects in nuclear architecture and increased vulnerability to DNA damage (Krshnan2022Regulated).

SUN2 also plays a role in anchoring meiotic telomeres to the nuclear envelope, forming a structural linkage between telomeres and the nuclear envelope, which is crucial for chromosome dynamics during meiosis (Schmitt2007Transmembrane). Additionally, SUN2 is involved in nuclear positioning and muscle development, with its interactions being critical for maintaining nuclear structure and function (Starr2010Interactions).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the SUN2 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly muscular dystrophies and cardiomyopathies. Variants in SUN2, such as p.M50T and p.V378I, have been identified in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, suggesting that these variants may act as genetic modifiers that influence disease severity. For instance, the SUN2 p.V378I variant was associated with early-onset hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and severe outcomes, while the p.M50T variant did not result in symptoms, indicating a potential role of SUN2 in modifying cardiomyopathy severity (Meinke2014Muscular).

In the context of muscular dystrophy, particularly Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD), SUN2 mutations can exacerbate disease severity when present alongside mutations in other genes like LMNA. These mutations disrupt nuclear-cytoskeletal connections, leading to impaired muscle function and increased disease severity (Meinke2014Muscular). The disruption of the LINC complex, which includes SUN2, is linked to defects in nuclear positioning and muscle cell mechanics, contributing to the pathophysiology of muscular dystrophies (Meinke2014Muscular).

SUN2 is also involved in maintaining genomic stability, with its absence leading to increased DNA damage and cell apoptosis, suggesting a role in cancer prevention (Chen2018SUN2:).

## Interactions
SUN2 is a component of the LINC (Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton) complex, which plays a crucial role in connecting the nuclear lamina to the cytoskeleton. It interacts with several proteins, including emerin, nesprin-2 isoforms, and lamin A/C, forming multiprotein complexes at the inner nuclear membrane (INM) (Haque2010Mammalian). SUN2's interaction with lamin A is essential for its localization at the nuclear envelope (NE), unlike SUN1, which can localize independently (Haque2010Mammalian).

SUN2 also forms disulfide-linked homo-oligomers through its cysteine residues, which are critical for the assembly and function of the LINC complex. Mutations in these cysteines can disrupt oligomerization and affect interactions with KASH peptides, impacting the actin cytoskeleton and cell migration (Sharma2023Disulfide). SUN2 interacts with the KASH domain of nesprin proteins, forming a nucleocytoplasmic bridge essential for nuclear motility and positioning (Schmitt2007Transmembrane).

In the context of neurogenesis and neuronal migration, SUN2, along with SUN1, interacts with Syne-1/2 complexes, which connect the centrosome to the nucleus. These interactions involve dynein/dynactin and kinesin complexes, facilitating nuclear movement during cell division (Zhang2009SUN12).
