# RHNO1

## Overview
RHNO1 (RAD9-HUS1-RAD1 interacting nuclear orphan 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the DNA damage response and repair mechanisms, crucial for maintaining genomic stability. The RHNO1 protein, also referred to as RHINO, is a key player in the DNA damage checkpoint signaling pathway. It interacts with the RAD9-HUS1-RAD1 (9-1-1) complex and TOPBP1, facilitating ATR-mediated Chk1 activation, which is essential for the cellular response to DNA replication stress (CottaRamusino2011A; Day2018BRCT). RHNO1's role extends to microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) during mitosis, where it collaborates with DNA polymerase theta (Polq) to promote this repair pathway (Brambati2023RHINO). The gene's involvement in these processes underscores its significance in cell cycle regulation and DNA repair, with implications in cancer susceptibility and resistance to certain therapies (Barger2019Coregulation; Smith2014Abstract).

## Function
RHNO1 (RAD9-HUS1-RAD1 interacting nuclear orphan 1) is a gene involved in the DNA damage response and repair processes, playing a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability. In healthy human cells, RHNO1 is active in the nucleus, where it interacts with the RAD9-HUS1-RAD1 complex, also known as the 9-1-1 complex, to facilitate DNA repair and replication processes (Barger2019Coregulation). This interaction is essential for promoting ATR activation, which is a key component of the DNA replication stress response and cell cycle checkpoint control (Barger2019Coregulation).

RHNO1 contains a conserved APSES DNA binding domain at its N-terminus, which is necessary for its interaction with the 9-1-1 complex, while its C-terminus is required for interactions with both the 9-1-1 complex and TOPBP1, as well as for localization to DNA damage sites (Barger2019Coregulation). Through these interactions, RHNO1 contributes to the homologous recombination repair pathway, a critical mechanism for repairing double-strand breaks in DNA, thereby ensuring genomic integrity and stability (Barger2019Coregulation). The gene's role in these molecular processes underscores its importance in cell biology, particularly in the context of DNA damage repair and cell cycle regulation.

## Clinical Significance
RHNO1 is implicated in several cancers due to its role in DNA damage response and repair pathways. In high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC), RHNO1 is co-expressed with FOXM1, and both genes are often amplified and overexpressed. This co-regulation promotes DNA repair, cell survival, and resistance to PARP inhibitors, making them potential targets for therapeutic strategies (Barger2019Coregulation). Knockdown of RHNO1 in HGSC cells reduces homologous recombination efficiency and increases sensitivity to the PARP inhibitor olaparib, suggesting its role in chemoresistance (Barger2019Coregulation).

In pancreatic cancer, RHNO1 mutations have been identified in familial cases, suggesting a role in cancer susceptibility. Protein-truncating variants in RHNO1 have been observed in multiple kindreds, indicating a potential genetic predisposition to pancreatic cancer (Smith2014Abstract). Although RHNO1 mutations do not always segregate with pancreatic cancer in families, they may contribute to cancer susceptibility through mechanisms like haploinsufficiency (Smith2014Abstract).

RHNO1 has also been associated with non-syndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P), highlighting its broader significance in developmental disorders (Yang2020Integrating).

## Interactions
RHNO1, also known as RHINO, is a protein that plays a significant role in the DNA damage response by interacting with several key proteins. It is known to interact with the RAD9-HUS1-RAD1 (9-1-1) complex, which is crucial for its function in DNA damage checkpoint signaling. This interaction is essential for the recruitment of RHNO1 to sites of DNA damage, facilitating ATR-mediated Chk1 activation, a critical step in the DNA damage response pathway (CottaRamusino2011A).

RHNO1 also interacts with TOPBP1, a protein involved in DNA replication and repair processes. The interaction with TOPBP1 is mediated through a specific binding site in the C-terminal region of RHNO1, centered on Thr202, which is a proline-directed kinase site. This interaction is phosphorylation-dependent and is crucial for RHNO1's role in ATR-CHK1 signaling (Day2018BRCT; Day2018Nterminal).

In addition to its role in the DNA damage response, RHNO1 is involved in microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) during mitosis. It interacts with DNA polymerase theta (Polq) to promote MMEJ, a repair pathway active when homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining are compromised (Brambati2023RHINO).
