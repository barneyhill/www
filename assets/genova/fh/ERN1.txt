# ERN1

## Overview
ERN1, also known as inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein integral to the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway. The IRE1 protein is characterized by its dual functional domains: a serine/threonine-protein kinase domain and an endoribonuclease (RNase) domain, which enable it to play a pivotal role in cellular stress responses. Upon activation by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, IRE1 initiates a signaling cascade that includes the unconventional splicing of XBP1 mRNA, leading to the production of a transcription factor that enhances the expression of genes involved in protein folding and degradation, thereby restoring ER homeostasis (Šuštić2018A; He2021Exomewide). Additionally, IRE1 is involved in regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD), which modulates gene expression under stress conditions. The protein's ubiquitous expression, particularly in brain microglia, underscores its essential role in maintaining cellular homeostasis (He2021Exomewide).

## Structure
The ERN1 gene encodes the IRE1 protein, a key component of the unfolded protein response. IRE1 is a transmembrane protein with a complex structure that includes several distinct domains. The primary structure of IRE1 features a kinase domain and an endoribonuclease (RNase) domain, which are crucial for its function in signal transduction and RNA cleavage (Korennykh2011Structural).

The secondary structure of IRE1 includes alpha helices and beta sheets. The RNase domain is characterized by a unique fold known as the KEN domain, which is formed by alpha helices and resembles the sterile alpha motif (Korennykh2012Structural). The kinase domain shares structural similarities with other well-known kinases, such as CDK2, Src, and EGFR (Korennykh2012Structural).

In terms of tertiary structure, the IRE1 protein undergoes conformational changes upon activation, which are essential for its function. These changes involve the movement of the αC-helix, a feature conserved among protein kinases, and are crucial for the activation of the RNase domain (Korennykh2011Cofactormediated).

The quaternary structure of IRE1 involves oligomerization, which is necessary for its activation. IRE1 forms high-order oligomers, with a cooperative activation mechanism that suggests at least eight monomers associate to form an active RNase assembly (Korennykh2012Structural). This oligomerization is stabilized by intermolecular interactions between the kinase and RNase domains (Korennykh2012Structural). Autophosphorylation of the kinase domain enhances IRE1 self-association and modulates RNase activity (Korennykh2012Structural).

## Function
ERN1, also known as IRE1, is a critical component of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway, which is activated in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. This protein possesses both a serine/threonine-protein kinase domain and a ribonuclease (RNase) domain, enabling it to perform dual functions in cellular stress responses (Šuštić2018A; He2021Exomewide). Upon detecting misfolded proteins in the ER, ERN1 initiates a signaling cascade that involves the splicing of XBP1 mRNA. This splicing event produces the active transcription factor XBP1s, which upregulates genes involved in protein folding, degradation, and ER-associated degradation (ERAD), thereby restoring ER homeostasis (Šuštić2018A; Bartoszewski2020Genome‐wide).

ERN1 is also involved in regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD), where it cleaves other mRNAs besides XBP1, contributing to the modulation of gene expression under stress conditions (Šuštić2018A). The protein is ubiquitously expressed in all brain cell types, with the highest expression in microglia, indicating its significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function in the brain (He2021Exomewide).

## Clinical Significance
The ERN1 gene, also known as IRE1, plays a significant role in various diseases due to its involvement in the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway. In cancer, alterations in ERN1 expression and activity have been linked to tumor progression and treatment resistance. In glioblastoma multiforme, a highly aggressive brain tumor, ERN1 is crucial for tumor growth and survival under hypoxic conditions. Its suppression has shown significant anti-proliferative effects on glioma growth, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Minchenko2015Inhibition; Minchenko2019Hypoxic). 

In KRAS mutant colon cancers, ERN1 regulates the response to MEK inhibitors, with its loss sensitizing cells to these treatments. This highlights its role in drug resistance and suggests potential therapeutic strategies targeting ERN1 (Šuštić2018A). 

ERN1 is also implicated in angiogenesis and tumor invasiveness. Inhibition of ERN1 in gliomas leads to down-regulation of proangiogenic factors and reduced tumor growth, indicating its role in tumor neovascularization (Auf2010Inositolrequiring). These findings underscore the clinical significance of ERN1 in cancer and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
ERN1, also known as IRE1, is a key sensor in the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway and participates in several critical interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. ERN1 interacts with the ER chaperone BiP (also known as GRP78), which regulates its activation. Under conditions of ER stress, BiP dissociates from ERN1, allowing ERN1 to oligomerize and become activated (Lievens2014Kinase). This activation involves the autophosphorylation of ERN1, which is crucial for its role in the UPR (Urano2000Coupling).

ERN1 also interacts with the adaptor protein TRAF2, which is essential for the activation of the JNK signaling pathway. This interaction leads to the phosphorylation of the transcription factor JUN, linking ERN1 to the regulation of stress responses and cell proliferation (Šuštić2018A). Additionally, ERN1 is involved in the splicing of XBP1 mRNA, a process that is critical for the production of a transcription factor that modulates UPR target genes (Urano2000Coupling). These interactions highlight ERN1's central role in managing cellular stress responses and maintaining homeostasis.
