# REEP2

## Overview
REEP2, or Receptor Expression Enhancing Protein 2, is a gene that encodes the protein receptor accessory protein 2, which is integral to membrane function and cellular signaling. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is involved in the modulation of sweet taste receptors, specifically the T1R2 and T1R3 subunits, by organizing them into lipid raft microdomains to enhance their function (Ilegems2010REEP2). REEP2 plays a critical role in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by contributing to membrane shaping and protein trafficking, facilitated by its amphipathic helical domains (Angelotti2022Exploring). Mutations in the REEP2 gene have been linked to hereditary spastic paraplegia, a neurodegenerative disorder, highlighting its clinical significance (Nan2021A). The protein's ability to induce high curvature in the ER membrane is essential for its function in cellular processes and its involvement in disease pathogenesis (Shibata2024The).

## Structure
REEP2 is an integral membrane protein characterized by a specific amino acid sequence that includes a signal peptide (amino acids 1-22), a single transmembrane region (amino acids 42-64), and a leucine-zipper region (amino acids 167-188) (Ilegems2010REEP2). The protein structure suggests a short extracellular N-terminal domain, a transmembrane region, and a long intracellular domain (Ilegems2010REEP2). REEP2 contains amphipathic helical (APH) domains, which are crucial for membrane fusion and interaction with atlastins, indicating its role in membrane shaping and protein trafficking (Angelotti2022Exploring).

The REEP family, including REEP2, is known for its dual hairpin structure, which inserts into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane to induce high curvature and ER tubulization (Angelotti2022Exploring). The carboxy terminal domain of REEP2 acts as an APH that aligns parallel to the membrane (Angelotti2022Exploring). REEP2 is also involved in the recruitment of sweet taste receptors to lipid rafts, enhancing receptor function by organizing them into membrane microdomains (Ilegems2010REEP2).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are significant for REEP2's function, as they regulate protein interactions and the formation of higher-order oligomers (Angelotti2022Exploring). Mutations in REEP2 are linked to hereditary spastic paraplegia, affecting ER structure and neuronal function (Angelotti2022Exploring).

## Function
REEP2 is a receptor expression enhancing protein that plays a crucial role in the function of sweet taste receptors in taste cells. It is an integral membrane protein that associates with the subunits of type 1 taste receptors, T1R2 and T1R3, which are involved in sweet taste perception. Unlike other receptor transporting proteins, REEP2 does not increase the cell surface expression of these receptors. Instead, it enhances their function by recruiting them into lipid raft microdomains near the apical region of taste cells. This spatial organization optimizes G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling and improves receptor access to tastants, thereby enhancing sweet taste perception (Ilegems2010REEP2).

REEP2 is expressed in type II taste cells and is particularly abundant in the circumvallate, fungiform, and foliate papillae. It is also found in the chemosensory enteroendocrine GLUTag cell line, where it enhances the sensitivity of endogenous sweet receptors. This enhancement is evidenced by increased GLP-1 secretion in response to sweeteners like sucralose, which is abolished when REEP2 expression is downregulated (Ilegems2010REEP2). The protein's role in clustering taste receptors into lipid rafts is crucial for efficient ligand access and receptor function (Ilegems2010REEP2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the REEP2 gene are associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive weakness and spasticity in the lower limbs. Specifically, a heterozygous missense mutation in REEP2, identified as c.119T>G, p.Met40Arg, has been linked to a 'pure' type of HSP known as SPG72. This mutation follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and has been documented in a Nepalese family, marking only the second known case of SPG72 with this inheritance pattern (Nan2021A).

The clinical presentation of SPG72 due to the REEP2 mutation includes symptoms such as a slow and spastic gait, which can begin in early childhood and progressively worsen over time. In the reported family, the proband, an 11-year-old girl, exhibited these symptoms from the age of two, while her father and uncle experienced milder manifestations. Genetic analysis confirmed the presence of the mutation in the proband and her father, but not in her unaffected brother or mother, suggesting a clear genetic link (Nan2021A).

The mutation is not found in the GnomAD database and has a high CADD score, indicating its potential pathogenicity. Understanding the genotype-phenotype correlations in SPG72 is crucial for advancing knowledge of this condition (Nan2021A).

## Interactions
REEP2 is known to interact specifically with the subunits of the sweet taste receptors T1R2 and T1R3, forming a complex that enhances receptor function by recruiting them to lipid raft microdomains. This interaction does not increase the cell surface expression of these receptors but rather optimizes their spatial organization, which is crucial for enhancing G-protein-coupled receptor signaling and improving receptor access to tastants (Ilegems2010REEP2). 

REEP2 is coexpressed with T1R3 and gustducin in type II taste cells, and it associates with sweet taste receptor subunits T1R2 and T1R3, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation assays. This suggests a specific interaction with T1R GPCRs, as REEP2 does not interact with other GPCRs like the 5-HT 1A or 5-HT 3 receptors (Ilegems2010REEP2). 

In addition to its role in taste receptor function, REEP2 is implicated in hereditary spastic paraplegia and distal hereditary motor neuropathy type Vb, where mutations in REEP2 can disrupt its normal function and lead to disease (Shibata2024The). These mutations may affect REEP2's ability to generate high membrane curvature, which is essential for its role in ER tubule dynamics (Shibata2024The).
