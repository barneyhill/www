# CMTM8

## Overview
CMTM8, or CKLF like MARVEL transmembrane domain containing 8, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the MARVEL domain-containing family, characterized by its transmembrane properties. The CMTM8 protein is involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of cancer biology, where it plays a role in modulating signaling pathways and cellular interactions. It has been implicated in the regulation of tumorigenesis and cancer progression, acting as a tumor suppressor in certain contexts. The protein's interactions with receptors such as LPA1 and EGFR, as well as its involvement in pathways like Wnt-β-catenin and ERK-MAPK, underscore its significance in cancer research and potential as a therapeutic target (Shi2021CMTM8; GAO2015CMTM8; Zhang2015Functional).

## Clinical Significance
CMTM8 has been implicated in various cancers due to its role as a tumor suppressor. In bladder cancer, CMTM8 expression is often downregulated, correlating with advanced tumor stages and grades. Overexpression of CMTM8 in bladder cancer cell lines has been shown to reduce cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and inhibit tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. This suggests that CMTM8 could serve as a prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic target for bladder cancer treatment (GAO2015CMTM8; Zhang2015Functional).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, reduced CMTM8 expression is associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) features, such as morphological changes and increased invasiveness. These changes are mediated by the ERK-MAPK pathway, and CMTM8 functions as a negative regulator of HGF/c-MET signaling to ERK, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target for cancers with hyperactivated c-MET/ERK signaling (Zhang2012Downregulation).

In lung cancer, CMTM8 polymorphisms have been linked to increased cancer susceptibility, particularly in lung squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Certain SNPs in the CMTM8 gene are associated with increased risks of lung cancer staging and lymph node metastasis, highlighting its role in tumor development and progression (Wu2019Influence).

## Interactions
CMTM8 (CKLF like MARVEL transmembrane domain containing 8) is involved in several interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of cancer. In pancreatic cancer, CMTM8 interacts with the LPA1 receptor, a known mediator of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) signaling. This interaction stabilizes CMTM8 protein levels and enhances its expression, which is crucial for the migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells. The interaction between CMTM8 and LPA1 is enhanced upon LPA treatment, suggesting a role in LPA-mediated signaling pathways (Shi2021CMTM8).

In bladder cancer, CMTM8 is associated with the inhibition of tumorigenesis, potentially through interactions with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Overexpression of CMTM8 has been shown to accelerate the clearance of EGFR from the cell surface, attenuating receptor-mediated signaling, which is significant in bladder cancer progression (GAO2015CMTM8; Zhang2015Functional).

CMTM8 is also implicated in the Wnt-β-catenin signaling pathway, which is involved in cancer progression. In pancreatic cancer, CMTM8 overexpression activates β-catenin signaling by reducing GSK3β levels, contributing to the invasiveness of cancer cells (Shi2021CMTM8).
