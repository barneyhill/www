# SERPINA1

## Overview
SERPINA1 is a gene that encodes the protein alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), a member of the serpin (serine protease inhibitor) superfamily. AAT is primarily synthesized in the liver and plays a critical role in protecting tissues from enzymes released by inflammatory cells, particularly neutrophil elastase. This protein is essential for maintaining the balance of protease activity in the body, thereby preventing tissue damage during inflammatory responses. The gene is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in multiple transcript variants that can influence the expression and function of AAT (Grayeski2022Global; Matamala2015Alternative). Mutations in SERPINA1 can lead to alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), a genetic disorder that predisposes individuals to lung and liver diseases due to the accumulation of misfolded AAT protein (Giacopuzzi2018Realworld; Foil2021Variants). The protein's structure, characterized by a reactive center loop and glycosylation sites, is crucial for its inhibitory function and interaction with target proteases (Poothong2021Defects; Mróz2024Computational).

## Structure
The SERPINA1 gene encodes the alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) protein, a serine protease inhibitor. The primary structure of AAT consists of a single polypeptide chain with 418 amino acids, including a 24 amino acid signal peptide (Mróz2024Computational). The secondary structure of AAT includes nine alpha-helices and three beta-sheets, with a prominent reactive center loop (RCL) that is exposed to the solvent (Poothong2021Defects; Mróz2024Computational). 

The tertiary structure of AAT forms a stable, globular shape, crucial for its function as an inhibitor of serine proteases. The methionine residue at position 358 within the RCL is critical for determining the protein's specificity of interaction with serine proteases (Mróz2024Computational). 

In terms of quaternary structure, certain mutations, such as the Z variant (E342K), lead to polymerization through loop-sheet interactions, resulting in the formation of ordered polymers that accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes (Poothong2021Defects; Greene2016α1Antitrypsin). 

Post-translational modifications of AAT include glycosylation, with three N-linked glycosylation sites at asparagine residues 46, 83, and 247, accounting for approximately 15% of the protein's molecular weight (Poothong2021Defects; Mróz2024Computational). The gene also undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple transcript variants that influence the expression and function of AAT (Grayeski2022Global; Matamala2015Alternative).

## Function
The SERPINA1 gene encodes the protein alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), a crucial serine protease inhibitor primarily synthesized in the liver and secreted into the bloodstream. AAT plays a significant role in protecting tissues from enzymes of inflammatory cells, particularly neutrophil elastase, which can degrade connective tissue if not regulated (de2014Role; Ercetin2019Clinical). AAT provides over 90% of the antiproteinase activity in human serum, inhibiting not only elastase but also other proteases such as proteinase-3, myeloperoxidase, and cathepsin G (de2014Role).

Beyond its protease inhibitory function, AAT exhibits anti-inflammatory and tissue-protective properties. It reduces the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and protects various cell types from apoptosis, thereby maintaining tissue integrity and preventing damage during inflammation (de2014Role). AAT is also involved in modulating acute inflammatory processes and plays a role in maintaining homeostasis and improving tissue repair and regeneration (Ercetin2019Clinical).

In healthy human cells, AAT is active in the lungs, where it prevents excessive tissue breakdown and maintains lung elasticity, crucial for respiratory health (Niemietz2020SERPINA1). The gene's expression is regulated by inflammatory stimuli, highlighting its role in the body's response to inflammation (de2014Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SERPINA1 gene, which encodes the alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) protein, are primarily associated with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), a condition that significantly affects the lungs and liver. AATD is characterized by reduced levels of circulating AAT, leading to an imbalance with neutrophil elastase, which can cause emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (Giacopuzzi2018Realworld; Foil2021Variants). In the liver, the accumulation of misfolded AAT protein can result in neonatal hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (Mróz2024Computational).

The most common pathogenic variants are the Z (p.E366K) and S (p.E288V) alleles. The Z variant is associated with severe deficiency due to protein misfolding and polymerization, while the S variant leads to a milder deficiency (Giacopuzzi2018Realworld; Foil2021Variants). Compound heterozygotes with both S and Z alleles are at increased risk for lung and liver diseases (Giacopuzzi2018Realworld). Null alleles, which result in a complete absence of AAT, are linked to a high risk of lung disease but not liver disease (Giacopuzzi2018Realworld).

The condition is often underdiagnosed due to symptom overlap with other diseases and variable phenotypic expression, making genetic testing crucial for accurate diagnosis (Mróz2024Computational).

## Interactions
SERPINA1, also known as alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT), is a serine protease inhibitor that primarily interacts with neutrophil elastase, protecting tissues from enzyme damage. It also interacts with other proteases such as proteinase 3 and cathepsin G, forming stable complexes that modulate inflammatory responses (Matamala2017Identification). The interaction between AAT and these proteases results in cleavage and loss of inhibitory activity, highlighting its role in controlling protease activity in inflammatory conditions (Matamala2017Identification).

In the context of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), SERPINA1 and its encoded protein AAT have been shown to interact with various proteins involved in inflammation, apoptosis, and proliferation. AAT can inhibit the expression of the autophagy protein BECN1 and interact with the NF-κB-TNFα-axis, potentially enhancing cell survival and contributing to cancer development (Ercetin2019Clinical). AAT also upregulates angiogenic genes like ANGPTL4 and VEGF, suggesting a role in tumor invasiveness and metastasis (Ercetin2019Clinical).

SERPINA1 has been found to modulate the expression of transthyretin (TTR), a protein involved in hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis. Knockdown of SERPINA1 in hepatoma cells leads to increased TTR levels, indicating a regulatory interaction that may influence TTR aggregation and deposition (Niemietz2020SERPINA1).
