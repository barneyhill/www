# HSP90AB1

## Overview
HSP90AB1 is a gene that encodes the protein heat shock protein 90 alpha family class B member 1 (Hsp90β), a molecular chaperone that is constitutively expressed and plays a pivotal role in maintaining cellular protein homeostasis. As a member of the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) family, Hsp90β is involved in the proper folding, stabilization, and activation of a diverse array of client proteins, including kinases and transcription factors, which are essential for various cellular processes such as cell survival, proliferation, and stress response (Hoter2018The; Maiti2022Cytosolic). The protein is characterized by its ability to form dimers and undergo post-translational modifications, which regulate its interactions with client proteins and co-chaperones (Prodromou2016Mechanisms). Hsp90β is implicated in numerous biological functions, including muscle regeneration, stem cell pluripotency, and metabolic regulation, and is associated with several diseases, making it a significant target for therapeutic interventions (Wang2018Hsp90ab1; Maiti2022Cytosolic).

## Structure
HSP90AB1 encodes a molecular chaperone that plays a crucial role in protein folding and stabilization. The primary structure of HSP90AB1 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the polypeptide chain. Its secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stability and function (Prodromou2016Mechanisms). The tertiary structure of HSP90AB1 is characterized by a three-dimensional conformation with distinct domains: an N-terminal domain (NTD) for ATP binding, a middle domain (MD) that modulates ATPase activity, and a C-terminal domain (CTD) responsible for dimerization (Prodromou2016Mechanisms; Hoter2018The).

HSP90AB1 functions as a dimer, which is essential for its chaperone activity, representing its quaternary structure (Hoter2018The). The protein undergoes various post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and acetylation, which regulate its interaction with client proteins and co-chaperones (Prodromou2016Mechanisms). Specific phosphorylation sites on HSP90AB1 influence its function and interactions (Prodromou2016Mechanisms). The protein's structure and modifications enable it to interact with approximately 10% of the eukaryotic proteome, implicating it in diverse biological processes (Prodromou2016Mechanisms).

## Function
The HSP90AB1 gene encodes the Hsp90β protein, a constitutively expressed molecular chaperone involved in various essential cellular processes. Hsp90β plays a critical role in maintaining protein homeostasis by assisting in the proper folding, stabilization, and activation of a wide range of client proteins, including kinases and transcription factors (Hoter2018The; Maiti2022Cytosolic). It is active in the cytoplasm and is crucial for cell survival, proliferation, and response to stress (Hoter2018The).

Hsp90β is involved in several cellular processes, such as trophoblast differentiation, muscle cell differentiation and regeneration, and the regulation of pluripotency in embryonic stem cells (Maiti2022Cytosolic). It interacts with specific proteins like STAT3 to regulate transcription factors such as Nanog, which are vital for maintaining stem cell pluripotency (Maiti2022Cytosolic). Hsp90β also plays a role in muscle regeneration by interacting with MDM2 to suppress p53-dependent senescence, aiding muscle repair after injury (Maiti2022Cytosolic).

Additionally, Hsp90β is essential for the formation of endodermal progenitor cells and liver development by interacting with hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 α (HNF4α) (Maiti2022Cytosolic). It regulates glucose and cholesterol metabolism, influencing insulin signaling and lipid homeostasis (Maiti2022Cytosolic). Hsp90β also contributes to maintaining the neuromuscular junction by stabilizing rapsyn, an acetylcholine receptor-interacting protein crucial for synapse formation (Maiti2022Cytosolic).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the HSP90AB1 gene, which encodes the Hsp90β isoform, have significant clinical implications across various diseases. In cancer, HSP90AB1 is overexpressed in gastric cancer, where it stabilizes LRP5, a co-receptor in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis. This overexpression correlates with poor prognosis and increased tumor aggressiveness (Wang2018Hsp90ab1). In lung adenocarcinoma, HSP90AB1 interacts with DSCC1, enhancing cancer progression by suppressing ER stress and activating the STAT3 signaling pathway, which is associated with shorter survival times (Lin2023DSCC1). 

HSP90AB1 is also implicated in resistance to HSP90 inhibitors in mammary and colorectal cancers. The USP22 gene regulates HSP90AB1 expression, and its loss leads to reduced HSP90AB1 levels, sensitizing cancer cells to HSP90 inhibition (Kosinsky2019USP22dependent). Beyond cancer, HSP90AB1 is involved in insulin resistance and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, where its serum levels may serve as a prognostic biomarker. In Alzheimer's disease, reduced Hsp90β levels are linked to neuronal cell death, suggesting potential therapeutic benefits from increasing its expression (Maiti2022Cytosolic). These findings highlight the gene's potential as a target for therapeutic interventions across multiple diseases.

## Interactions
HSP90AB1, also known as HSP90β, is a molecular chaperone that engages in numerous physical interactions with other proteins, playing a critical role in various cellular processes. It interacts with kinases, transcription factors, ubiquitin ligases, and MAPK proteins, including MAPK6 and p38MAPK/MAPK14. HSP90AB1 forms complexes with Cdc37 to retain ERK5 in the cytoplasm, and upon activation, ERK5 translocates to the nucleus (Haase2016HSP90AB1:). It also interacts with TRIM8, which inhibits SMAD3 translocation into the nucleus, affecting Nanog transcription in embryonic stem cells (Haase2016HSP90AB1:).

HSP90AB1 is involved in the stabilization of tau protein, relevant in Alzheimer's disease, and interacts with co-chaperones like CHIP, Cdc37, p23, PP5, FKBP51, and S100A1, which are potential therapeutic targets for tauopathies (Haase2016HSP90AB1:). It is essential for the biosynthesis and function of the IKK complex, involved in NF-kappaB activation, and interacts with the cytoskeleton by binding to actin and N-WASP, promoting actin polymerization and stabilization (Haase2016HSP90AB1:).

In cancer, HSP90AB1 stabilizes proteins with activating mutations, promoting cancer cell survival. It interacts with HIF-1 in a complex with Bcl-2, leading to increased tumor angiogenesis and metastasis (Haase2016HSP90AB1:). HSP90AB1 also regulates GRK6 expression, necessary for STAT3 phosphorylation and activation of MCL1, a protein involved in multiple myeloma cell proliferation (Haase2016HSP90AB1:).
