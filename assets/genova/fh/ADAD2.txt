# ADAD2

## Overview
ADAD2 is a gene that encodes the protein adenosine deaminase domain containing 2, which is a testis-specific RNA binding protein. This protein plays a crucial role in the differentiation of male germ cells and is essential for normal male fertility. It is involved in the formation of granules in meiotic germ cells, which are associated with intermitochondrial cement and piRNA biogenesis, as well as translation regulators such as NANOS1 and PUM1 (Chukrallah2023Two). The ADAD2 protein interacts with RNF17 to form a heterogeneous population of novel meiotic germ cell granules, which are implicated in translation regulation and RNA processing (Chukrallah2023Two). The absence of ADAD2 leads to significant defects in germ cell development, resulting in male sterility (Snyder2020ADAD1).

## Function
ADAD2 is a testis-specific RNA binding protein involved in the differentiation of male germ cells and is essential for normal male fertility. It forms granules in meiotic germ cells, which are associated with intermitochondrial cement and piRNA biogenesis, as well as translation regulators like NANOS1 and PUM1 (Chukrallah2023Two). ADAD2 interacts with another testis-specific RNA binding protein, RNF17, to form a heterogeneous population of novel meiotic germ cell granules. These granules are involved in translation regulation and are associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), suggesting a role in RNA processing and translation regulation in germ cells (Chukrallah2023Two).

The ADAD2-RNF17 granules have a unique structure, with ADAD2 forming a funnel shape and RNF17 observed towards the exterior, indicating that ADAD2 may play a role in the structural organization of these granules (Chukrallah2023Two). The loss of ADAD2 results in altered translation of specific transcripts involved in heterochromatin remodeling, affecting post-meiotic germ cell chromatin structure (Chukrallah2023Two). ADAD2 is crucial for the transition from round to elongating spermatids, and its absence leads to severe defects in germ cell development and male sterility (Snyder2020ADAD1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ADAD2 gene are associated with non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA), a condition characterized by the absence of sperm in the ejaculate due to testicular pathologies. ADAD2 is implicated in meiotic arrest (MA) and incomplete spermatogenic arrest (SGA) in NOA, as identified in two patients from independent cohorts (Cioppi2021Genetics). The gene is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, with mutations reported in two unrelated cases (Capalbo2020Preconception). ADAD2 is also mentioned as a potential factor in macrozoospermia, a condition involving abnormal sperm morphology, although specific mutations have been identified in only a few case reports (Graziani2024Genetic).

The clinical significance of ADAD2 extends to its role in both male and female infertility. Knockout studies in mice suggest that ADAD2, along with other genes, may contribute to infertility in both sexes, indicating a potential common role in NOA and primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) phenotypes (Cioppi2021Genetics). This highlights the importance of genetic counseling for families affected by NOA, as related genetic conditions may also impact female relatives.

## Interactions
ADAD2, a testis-specific RNA binding protein, interacts significantly with RNF17, another RNA binding protein, to form novel meiotic germ cell granules. These granules are crucial for male germ cell differentiation and fertility. The interaction between ADAD2 and RNF17 is essential for the formation of these granules, as the absence of either protein disrupts granule formation. This interaction is characterized by a mutual dependency, where ADAD2 is necessary for the localization and formation of large RNF17 granules in pachytene spermatocytes, and vice versa (Chukrallah2023Two).

The granules formed by ADAD2 and RNF17 are involved in RNA processes, including translation regulation, and are associated with various cellular structures such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria. The granules display a unique structure, with ADAD2 forming a dense ring around the outer rim and RNF17 located towards the exterior, indicating specific physical interactions within the granule (Chukrallah2023Two).

ADAD2's interactions are not limited to RNF17, as it also shows colocalization with translation regulators like NANOS1 and PUM1, suggesting a role in translation regulation (Chukrallah2023Two). However, ADAD2 does not appear to directly influence RNA editing, as studies have shown no significant impact on mRNA editing in Adad mutants (Snyder2020ADAD1).
