# DCUN1D4

## Overview
DCUN1D4 is a human gene that encodes the protein defective in cullin neddylation 1 domain containing 4. This protein is involved in the neddylation process, a post-translational modification that is crucial for the regulation of cullin-RING ligases, which are a subset of ubiquitin ligases. The DCUN1D4 protein plays a significant role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is essential for protein degradation and turnover within the cell. As a component of this system, DCUN1D4 is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and signal transduction. Dysregulation of DCUN1D4 has been associated with several pathological conditions, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Qiu2020aarFDC).
