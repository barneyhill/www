# GTF2E1

## Overview
GTF2E1 is a gene that encodes the alpha subunit of the general transcription factor IIE (TFIIEα), a critical component in the transcription initiation process by RNA polymerase II in eukaryotic cells. The protein encoded by GTF2E1, TFIIEα, functions as part of a heterodimer with TFIIEβ, playing a pivotal role in the recruitment and stabilization of the transcription machinery at gene promoter regions. This includes facilitating the integration of the CDK-activating kinase module of TFIIH, which is essential for the transition from transcription initiation to elongation (Compe2019TFIIE; Miwa2016Crystal). TFIIEα is categorized as a transcription factor, and its interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids underscore its importance in regulating gene expression. Alterations in GTF2E1 expression or function have been linked to various diseases, including preeclampsia and colorectal cancer, as well as playing a role in the replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (Moslehi2014Nucleotide; Dziuba2012Identification; Mo2021MicroRNA).

## Function
GTF2E1 encodes the alpha subunit of the general transcription factor IIE (TFIIEα), which plays a crucial role in the transcription initiation process by RNA polymerase II in eukaryotic cells. TFIIEα, in conjunction with its partner subunit TFIIEβ, forms a heterodimer that is essential for the recruitment and stabilization of the transcription machinery at the promoter region of genes. This includes the recruitment of TFIIH, a complex that is vital for promoter opening and the transition from transcription initiation to elongation (Miwa2016Crystal).

The TFIIE complex is involved in the formation of the pre-initiation complex (PIC), facilitating the integration of the CDK-activating kinase (CAK) module of TFIIH. This integration is necessary for the phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, a key step that allows the transition from transcription initiation to elongation (Compe2019TFIIE). TFIIEα is recruited to the promoter via interactions with TFIIEβ, which directly interacts with RNA polymerase II (Compe2019TFIIE).

In healthy cells, TFIIE is active in the cell nucleus, where it plays a pivotal role in gene expression regulation by ensuring the proper assembly and function of the transcription machinery (Compe2019TFIIE).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or interactions of the GTF2E1 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In preeclampsia, a condition characterized by high blood pressure during pregnancy, GTF2E1 is identified as a key regulator in gene networks that are altered. The gene's downregulation and its impaired interaction with the TFIIH complex are associated with the dysregulation of the basal transcription pathway in preeclamptic placentas, suggesting a role in the development of this condition (Moslehi2014Nucleotide).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), GTF2E1 expression is regulated by microRNA 452 (MIR452), which directly targets its mRNA, leading to decreased expression. This downregulation is observed in CRC tissues and cell lines, indicating that GTF2E1 may play a role in CRC pathogenesis (Mo2021MicroRNA). Additionally, GTF2E1 is identified as a prognostic dosage-sensitive gene in CRC, with its expression levels linked to somatic copy number alterations and associated with poor prognosis (Chang2020Identification).

GTF2E1 is also crucial for the replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), where its silencing inhibits viral replication and Tat-dependent gene expression, highlighting its importance in the viral life cycle (Dziuba2012Identification).

## Interactions
GTF2E1, a subunit of the general transcription factor IIE, is integral to the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. It engages in several critical interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. GTF2E1 interacts with TFIIH, a component of the transcription machinery, to facilitate the formation of the pre-initiation complex. This interaction is essential for the proper initiation of transcription, as it aids in promoter melting and the selection of transcription start sites. Through these interactions, GTF2E1 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression by ensuring that RNA polymerase II is correctly positioned to begin transcription. The ability of GTF2E1 to interact with nucleic acids further underscores its importance in transcription initiation, as it helps stabilize the transcription machinery at the promoter region, allowing for efficient transcription initiation and elongation. These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of GTF2E1 in transcription regulation, emphasizing its importance in the complex network of protein and nucleic acid interactions that govern gene expression.
