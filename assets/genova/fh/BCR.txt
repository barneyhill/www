# BCR

## Overview
The BCR gene encodes the BCR activator of RhoGEF and GTPase, a multifunctional protein involved in cellular signaling and regulation. This protein is categorized as a kinase due to its serine/threonine kinase domain, which is essential for its autophosphorylation and kinase activity (Maru1991The). BCR plays a pivotal role in the regulation of Rho GTPases, contributing to processes such as actin cytoskeleton reorganization and cell cycle regulation (Korus2002p38). It also exhibits GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity, particularly for Rho family members like Rac1, Rac2, and Cdc42, which are involved in immune responses and cellular homeostasis (Korus2002p38). The BCR protein is implicated in several critical protein interactions, including those with the 14-3-3 family and RhoGDIα, influencing its GAP activity and signal transduction roles (Kweon2008Activity; Reuther1994Association). Clinically, the BCR gene is most notable for its involvement in the BCR-ABL fusion gene, a key factor in the pathogenesis of chronic myeloid leukemia and other hematological malignancies (Ye2014Clinical).

## Structure
The BCR protein is a 160 kDa phosphoprotein with several functional domains that contribute to its role in cellular signaling and transformation. The N-terminal region contains a coiled-coil domain (amino acids 1-63), which is crucial for oligomerization and the activation of the Abl tyrosine kinase in the BCR-ABL fusion protein (McWhirter1993A; McWhirter1997Effect). This domain forms a homotetramer and is characterized by an amphipathic alpha helix with a heptad repeat of hydrophobic residues, essential for its oligomerization function (McWhirter1993A).

The BCR protein also includes a serine/threonine kinase domain encoded within its first exon, which is involved in autophosphorylation and is essential for its kinase activity (Maru1991The). The central region of BCR contains domains homologous to Dbl-like guanine nucleotide exchange factors and pleckstrin homology domains, which are involved in the regulation of Rho GTPases (Reuther1994Association; Pane2002BCRABL).

The C-terminal region of BCR has GTPase-activating protein activity for the Rac GTP-binding protein, contributing to its role in signal transduction (Reuther1994Association). Tyrosine 177 within the BCR sequence can be phosphorylated, allowing interaction with the Grb2 adaptor protein, linking BCR to the Ras signaling pathway (Pane2002BCRABL).

## Function
The BCR gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in cellular signaling and regulation. In healthy human cells, the BCR protein is involved in activating NF-kB through a p38 MAPK-dependent mechanism. This activation does not require nuclear translocation, suggesting that BCR influences a preexisting nuclear pool of NF-kB, potentially through the phosphorylation of the RelA/p65 transactivation domain (Korus2002p38). The BCR protein is part of the RhoGEF family, which includes proteins with a DH/PH domain tandem motif that mediates Rho protein binding and guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) catalytic activity. These domains are crucial for the transforming activity associated with RhoGEFs, contributing to cellular processes such as actin cytoskeleton reorganization and cell cycle regulation (Korus2002p38).

The BCR protein also exhibits GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity, specifically for Rho family members like Rac1, Rac2, and Cdc42, which are involved in various cellular functions, including immune responses and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Korus2002p38). The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it participates in oligomerization and kinase activity, including autophosphorylation and transphosphorylation (Korus2002p38).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the BCR gene are significantly associated with various hematological malignancies. The BCR-ABL fusion gene, resulting from a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, is a hallmark of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and is also present in some cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (Ye2014Clinical). This fusion leads to the production of a constitutively active tyrosine kinase that drives uncontrolled cell proliferation and survival, contributing to the pathogenesis of these leukemias (Ye2014Clinical).

In CML, the presence of BCR-ABL mutations is a common mechanism of resistance to imatinib mesylate therapy, with mutations occurring in 30-90% of patients who develop resistance (Jabbour2006Frequency). These mutations often occur in the ATP-binding site and activation loop of the BCR-ABL protein, impairing the binding of imatinib and allowing the malignant clone to proliferate (von2002BCRABL).

In B cell malignancies, BCR signaling is crucial for the survival and proliferation of malignant B cells. Alterations in BCR signaling pathways, such as mutations in CD79A and CD79B, are associated with the aggressiveness and progression of diseases like diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (Rickert2013New).

## Interactions
The BCR protein is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins, influencing various cellular processes. It interacts with proteins of the 14-3-3 family, such as Bap-1, which is phosphorylated by Bcr-Abl but not by c-Abl. This interaction may regulate c-Bcr and contribute to the transforming activity of Bcr-Abl (Reuther1994Association). BCR also forms a complex with RhoGDIα, a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor, which affects its GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity. This interaction is modulated by the presence of Rac1 in different conformations, with GTP-bound Rac1 inhibiting the BCR/RhoGDIα interaction (Kweon2008Activity).

The BCR-ABL fusion protein, resulting from a chromosomal translocation, interacts with the GRB-2 adaptor protein. This interaction is mediated by the SH2 domain of GRB-2 binding to phosphorylated tyrosine 177 within the BCR sequence, which is crucial for the activation of the Ras signaling pathway and the oncogenic potential of BCR-ABL (Pendergast1993BCRABLinduced). These interactions highlight the role of BCR in signal transduction and its involvement in leukemogenesis.
