# TSTD1

## Overview
TSTD1 is a gene that encodes the protein thiosulfate sulfurtransferase like domain containing 1, which plays a significant role in cellular sulfur metabolism and redox balance. This protein is primarily localized in the mitochondria, where it participates in the conversion of glutathione and thiosulfate into sulfide and glutathione persulfide, thus contributing to sulfide signaling and the glutathione-dependent sulfide oxidation pathway (Ansar2022Promoter). As a sulfurtransferase, TSTD1 is crucial for maintaining reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis and is involved in detoxification processes. Beyond its metabolic functions, TSTD1 is implicated in cholesterol and lipid metabolism, influencing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels and cholesterol biosynthesis (Zheng2021Integrative). The protein's involvement in these pathways underscores its importance in cellular energy metabolism and homeostasis, as well as its potential impact on various diseases, including Parkinson's disease, keratoconus, and hepatocellular carcinoma.

## Function
The TSTD1 gene encodes a protein involved in various cellular and molecular processes, particularly in sulfur metabolism and cellular redox balance. TSTD1 is active in the mitochondria, where it contributes to cellular energy metabolism and homeostasis. The protein catalyzes the reaction between glutathione and thiosulfate, forming sulfide and glutathione persulfide, which suggests its involvement in sulfide signaling and the glutathione-dependent sulfide oxidation pathway (Ansar2022Promoter). This activity is crucial for maintaining the balance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within cells, as knockdown of TSTD1 leads to a reduction in ROS levels and an increase in the GSH/GSSG ratio, indicating its role in detoxification processes (Ansar2022Promoter).

In addition to its role in sulfur metabolism, TSTD1 is implicated in cholesterol and lipid metabolism. Studies in mice have shown that TSTD1 expression is positively correlated with plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels and genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis. This suggests that TSTD1 may influence HDL levels by modulating these molecular processes, highlighting its role in regulating cholesterol metabolism and mitochondrial functions (Zheng2021Integrative). These functions underscore the importance of TSTD1 in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
TSTD1 has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In Parkinson's disease (PD), TSTD1 is significantly upregulated in dopaminergic neurons from older individuals and those with sporadic and genetic PD. This upregulation is associated with increased oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, contributing to the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, a hallmark of PD pathogenesis (Lau2021Identification).

In keratoconus, a corneal disorder, TSTD1 is one of the genes consistently found to be upregulated in affected corneas. This suggests a potential role in the disease's pathogenicity, although the specific clinical implications of TSTD1 alterations in keratoconus remain to be fully elucidated (Hao2022Systematically).

TSTD1 expression is also affected in the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Changes in promoter methylation of TSTD1, influenced by the overexpression of ADI1, suggest a potential role in tumor suppression. This mechanism involves epigenetic alterations that may impact gene expression relevant to cancer progression (Chu2019The).

These findings highlight the importance of TSTD1 in various pathological conditions, emphasizing the need for further research to understand its full clinical significance.
