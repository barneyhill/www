# RXFP4

## Overview
The RXFP4 gene encodes the relaxin family peptide receptor 4, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a significant role in various physiological processes. As a member of the GPCR family, RXFP4 is characterized by its seven transmembrane helices, which facilitate its function as a receptor for the peptide hormone insulin-like peptide 5 (INSL5) (Chen2022A). The RXFP4 protein is primarily expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, particularly in the colorectum, where it is involved in regulating food intake and glucose homeostasis (Chen2023Ligand). Through its interaction with Gαi/o proteins, RXFP4 modulates intracellular signaling pathways that influence cellular growth, proliferation, and metabolism (Ang2016Signal). The receptor's clinical significance is underscored by its association with metabolic disorders, including obesity and impaired glucose tolerance, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Halls2015International).

## Structure
The human relaxin family peptide receptor 4 (RXFP4) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by its seven transmembrane helices, a common feature of GPCRs (Chen2022A). The primary structure of RXFP4 includes specific amino acid sequences that facilitate ligand binding, particularly within its orthosteric pocket, which is bordered by transmembrane domains 2-7 and extracellular loops 1-3 (Chen2022A). The receptor's binding pocket is deeply buried and occluded, allowing the C-terminal α-helix of the INSL5 B chain to penetrate it, which is distinct from the more exposed pockets of insulin and IGF-1 receptors (Chen2022A).

The secondary structure of RXFP4 includes a unique peptide-binding mode where the B chain of INSL5 adopts a single α-helix conformation that penetrates the orthosteric pocket, while the A chain interacts with the extracellular surface (Chen2022A). The tertiary structure involves conformational changes that propagate to the intracellular side, affecting the movement of transmembrane helix 6 and G protein coupling (Chen2022A).

RXFP4 may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can influence its function. The receptor also has splice variant isoforms, which may affect its activity and interactions (Chen2022A).

## Function
The relaxin family peptide receptor 4 (RXFP4) is a G protein-coupled receptor primarily activated by insulin-like peptide 5 (INSL5). RXFP4 is involved in several intracellular signaling pathways, primarily through coupling with Gαi/o proteins. This interaction inhibits cAMP production and activates pathways such as ERK1/2, Akt, and S6 ribosomal protein (S6RP), which are associated with cellular growth, proliferation, and metabolism (Ang2016Signal). RXFP4 is expressed predominantly in the gastrointestinal tract, particularly in the colorectum, and plays a role in regulating food intake and glucose homeostasis (Chen2023Ligand; Ang2016Signal).

In pancreatic β cells, RXFP4 activation by INSL5 inhibits glucose-mediated insulin release and Ca2+ response, suggesting a role in modulating insulin secretion (Ang2016Signal). The receptor undergoes classical GRK and β-arrestin mediated internalization, moving towards early endosomes, which is a common feature of G protein-coupled receptor signaling (Ang2016Signal). The structural interaction between INSL5 and RXFP4 involves the deep insertion of INSL5 into the receptor's orthosteric pocket, inducing conformational changes that facilitate G protein coupling and downstream signaling (Chen2023Ligand).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the RXFP4 gene have been linked to several metabolic disorders. Polymorphisms in RXFP4 are associated with an increased body mass index and a trend towards obesity, suggesting a potential link between RXFP4 expression alterations and metabolic conditions (Halls2015International). RXFP4 knockout mice exhibit impaired glucose tolerance, indicating its involvement in glucose metabolism and energy homeostasis (Halls2015International). 

The receptor's endogenous ligand, insulin-like peptide 5 (INSL5), is implicated in energy metabolism, and deficiencies in INSL5 or RXFP4 lead to impaired glucose and fat control in mice (Chen2023Ligand). RXFP4 is also associated with colon motility and has been linked to colorectal cancer and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (Chen2023Ligand). 

In humans, increased serum relaxin-3 levels, which may activate RXFP4, have been observed in women with metabolic syndrome, suggesting a possible association between RXFP4 and this condition (Halls2015International). Despite these findings, the precise mechanisms by which RXFP4 affects metabolism and its full clinical implications require further research (Halls2015International).

## Interactions
The human relaxin family peptide receptor 4 (RXFP4) primarily interacts with the peptide hormone insulin-like peptide 5 (INSL5). This interaction is characterized by the B chain of INSL5 inserting into the orthosteric pocket of RXFP4, which is formed by transmembrane domains 2-7 and extracellular loops 1-3. The C-terminal residues of the B chain, particularly W24B, are crucial for stabilizing the peptide binding through hydrogen bonds and stacking interactions (Chen2022A; Chen2023Ligand). 

RXFP4 is a G protein-coupled receptor that engages with Gα i/o proteins. The α5 helix of the G i subunit fits into the cytoplasmic cavity formed by transmembrane segments and intracellular loops of RXFP4, facilitating hydrophobic contacts and hydrogen bonds. This interaction is essential for the receptor's signaling pathways, which include the inhibition of cAMP accumulation and activation of ERK1/2 (Chen2023Ligand; Ang2016Signal). 

RXFP4 also interacts with β-arrestins and GRK2, which are involved in receptor internalization and translocation to early endosome compartments. These interactions contribute to the receptor's ability to modulate various intracellular signaling pathways (Ang2016Signal).
