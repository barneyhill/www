# CERT1

## Overview
CERT1 is a gene that encodes the ceramide transporter protein 1, a critical component in the intracellular transport of ceramide, a lipid molecule integral to sphingolipid metabolism. The CERT1 protein is categorized as a lipid transfer protein and is primarily involved in the non-vesicular transfer of ceramide from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. This process is essential for the conversion of ceramide into sphingomyelin, a key structural component of cell membranes (Sugiki2012Structural; Hanada2003Molecular). The protein's structure includes several functional domains, such as the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and the START domain, which are crucial for its lipid-transfer activity and membrane association (Gehin2023CERT1; Hanada2003Molecular). CERT1's function is tightly regulated by phosphorylation, which modulates its activity to maintain sphingolipid homeostasis, impacting cellular processes like apoptosis and cell proliferation (Gehin2023CERT1; Goto2020Sphingolipid). Mutations in the CERT1 gene have been linked to various neurological and developmental disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (Gehin2023CERT1).

## Structure
The CERT1 protein, encoded by the CERT1 gene, is involved in the transport of ceramide between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. Its molecular structure includes several functional domains. The N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain is responsible for membrane association by interacting with phosphoinositide phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate on the trans Golgi (Gehin2023CERT1; Hanada2003Molecular). The central core domain (CCD) is involved in dimerization, forming a T-shaped dimeric conformation with two PH domains and two START domains (Gehin2023CERT1). The START domain is crucial for lipid-transfer activity, specifically for ceramide (Hanada2003Molecular).

CERT1 also contains a serine-rich region (SRR), which is a hotspot for mutations and is targeted by protein kinase D and casein kinase 1γ2 for phosphorylation. This post-translational modification is essential for CERT autoregulation, as it leads to a conformational change that inactivates the protein (Gehin2023CERT1). The protein has at least two splice variant isoforms, with isoform 1 being the predominant transcript (Murakami2020Intellectual). The structure and function of CERT1 are influenced by these domains and their interactions, which are critical for maintaining sphingolipid homeostasis (Gehin2023CERT1).

## Function
CERT1, also known as ceramide transporter 1, plays a crucial role in the intracellular transport of ceramide, a lipid molecule essential for sphingolipid metabolism. In healthy human cells, CERT1 facilitates the non-vesicular transfer of ceramide from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus, where ceramide is converted into sphingomyelin (SM), a key component of cell membranes (Sugiki2012Structural; Hanada2003Molecular). This transport process is vital for maintaining sphingolipid homeostasis, which is critical for cellular functions such as membrane structure, signal transduction, and brain development (Gehin2023CERT1).

CERT1 contains several functional domains, including the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which targets the Golgi apparatus, and the START domain, which is responsible for ceramide extraction and transfer (Sugiki2012Structural; Hanada2003Molecular). The protein's activity is regulated by phosphorylation, which modulates its function to ensure proper sphingolipid synthesis and prevent neurotoxic effects (Gehin2023CERT1). CERT1's role in ceramide transport is essential for maintaining the lipid composition necessary for membrane dynamics and cellular signaling, impacting processes such as apoptosis and cell proliferation (Goto2020Sphingolipid).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CERT1 gene, which encodes the ceramide transporter protein CERT, are associated with a range of neurological and developmental disorders. These mutations can lead to a condition known as CerTra syndrome, characterized by intellectual disability, motor and speech delays, increased pain tolerance, and seizures. The mutations disrupt CERT autoregulation, resulting in increased sphingolipid synthesis and potentially neurotoxic compound production, which correlates with the clinical severity of the associated conditions (Gehin2023CERT1).

Specific mutations, such as p.S132, p.S135, and p.G243, are linked to severe phenotypes, including profound intellectual disability and significant motor delays. These mutations also affect the phosphorylation and localization of the CERT protein, leading to altered sphingolipid levels (Gehin2023CERT1). In Drosophila models, increased CERT1 dosage resulted in smaller brain sizes and locomotor hypoactivity, which were reversible with CERT inhibitors, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach (Gehin2023CERT1).

CERT1 mutations are also implicated in intellectual disability with gain-of-function effects, leading to abnormal activation and distribution of the protein. These mutations are associated with cerebral atrophy and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum in patients (Murakami2020Intellectual).

## Interactions
CERT1, encoding the ceramide transport protein CERT, is involved in several critical protein interactions that facilitate its function in ceramide transport. CERT contains a Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domain that binds to phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI(4)P), which is essential for its localization to the Golgi apparatus (Chung2021Ceramide; Goto2020Sphingolipid). The FFAT motif of CERT interacts with vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated proteins (VAPs), specifically VAP-A and VAP-B, anchoring CERT to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Chung2021Ceramide; Hanada2022Natural). These interactions are crucial for CERT's role in ceramide transport between the ER and the Golgi.

CERT also interacts with oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP), which can influence its function by competing for binding sites, thereby affecting ceramide transfer to the Golgi (Chung2021Ceramide). Phosphorylation of CERT at specific serine residues, such as S132 and S315, modulates its interactions and function, with phosphorylation at S315 enhancing its affinity for VAP, promoting ceramide trafficking (Goto2020Sphingolipid). CERT's interactions with other proteins, such as the amyloid precursor protein and serum amyloid P component, suggest roles in additional cellular processes, including neuroprotection and immune response (Chung2021Ceramide).
