# GEN1

## Overview
GEN1 is a gene that encodes the GEN1 Holliday junction 5' flap endonuclease, a crucial enzyme involved in DNA repair processes. This protein is a member of the Rad2/XPG family of nucleases and plays a significant role in maintaining genomic stability by resolving Holliday junctions, which are key intermediates in homologous recombination and DNA double-strand break repair (Gao2012A; Sarbajna2014Roles). The GEN1 protein is characterized by its catalytic core and chromodomain, which facilitate DNA interaction and cleavage (Lee2015Human). Beyond its role in DNA repair, GEN1 is also involved in centrosome maintenance, contributing to proper cell cycle progression and preventing genomic instability (Gao2012A). Mutations in the GEN1 gene have been linked to congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) and have implications in cancer, particularly epithelial ovarian cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Li2024Functional; Wang2018Disruption).

## Structure
The human GEN1 protein is a member of the Rad2/XPG family of nucleases, characterized by its ability to resolve Holliday junctions, which are critical intermediates in DNA repair processes. The molecular structure of GEN1 includes a catalytic core formed by intertwined XPG-N and XPG-I domains, consisting of a seven-stranded beta-sheet surrounded by nine helices (Lee2015Human). The protein also features a 5'->3' exonuclease C-terminal domain with a helix-two-turn-helix (H2TH) motif, which is involved in non-sequence specific DNA recognition (Lee2015Human).

A unique aspect of GEN1 is the presence of a chromodomain, which is crucial for its DNA interaction and catalytic activity. This chromodomain is characterized by a chalice-shaped structure with three antiparallel beta-strands packed against a C-terminal alpha-helix, forming an aromatic cage (Lee2015Human). The chromodomain directly contacts DNA, enhancing GEN1's ability to recognize and cleave DNA substrates (Lee2015Human).

GEN1 functions as a dimer, with two monomers coming together upon Holliday junction binding, which facilitates coordinated cleavage of the DNA (Lee2015Human). The protein's structure undergoes a disorder-to-order transition upon DNA binding, forming an arch with helices a4 and a6 (Lee2015Human).

## Function
The GEN1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability in human cells. GEN1 functions as a Holliday junction resolvase, which is essential for the homology-driven repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) through homologous recombination (HR) (Gao2012A; Sarbajna2014Roles). This protein is involved in resolving recombination intermediates, particularly during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, acting as a backup to the BTR pathway (Sarbajna2014Roles). GEN1 cleaves Holliday junctions by introducing two coordinated nicks across the junction, facilitating proper chromosome segregation and preventing genomic instability (Sarbajna2014Roles).

In addition to its role in DNA repair, GEN1 is associated with centrosomes, where it helps maintain centrosome integrity. Its presence at the centrosomes is necessary to prevent centrosome amplification, which can lead to multipolar spindles and mitotic defects (Gao2012A). The protein's centrosomal localization is independent of its nuclease activity, indicating a structural role at the centrosome (Gao2012A). GEN1's dual functions in DNA repair and centrosome maintenance are crucial for genomic stability and proper cell cycle progression (Gao2012A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GEN1 gene have been implicated in congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), a significant cause of renal failure in infants and children. GEN1 mutations can lead to impaired expression of critical genes such as Gdnf and Grem1, resulting in abnormal ureteric bud formation and branching. This disruption can cause conditions like renal agenesis, duplex kidney, hydronephrosis, and vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) (Wang2020Gen1; Wang2018Disruption). In humans, rare GEN1 variants have been identified in CAKUT patients, with certain mutations leading to decreased protein stability and enzymatic activity, contributing to the pathogenesis of the disease (Du2024GEN1).

In the context of cancer, the GEN1 gene has been studied for its role in epithelial ovarian cancer. The rs56070363 variant of GEN1 is associated with increased mRNA expression and is linked to shorter overall survival in ovarian cancer patients. This variant may affect the tumor immune microenvironment and promote cancer cell proliferation and metastasis, suggesting that GEN1 could function as an oncogene in this context (Li2024Functional). These findings highlight the clinical significance of GEN1 mutations in both renal and cancer pathologies.

## Interactions
The GEN1 protein interacts with DNA through several structural features, including a chromodomain that enhances its ability to recognize and cleave diverse DNA substrates, such as Holliday junctions (HJs) and replication fork intermediates (Lee2015Human). The chromodomain provides an additional DNA anchoring point, facilitating efficient substrate cleavage through van-der-Waals interactions rather than hydrogen bonds (Lee2015Human). GEN1 forms a homodimer upon binding to HJ substrates, which is necessary for its dual incision mechanism, ensuring both incisions occur within the lifetime of the GEN1-HJ complex (Lee2015Human).

GEN1's interactions with other proteins include potential regulatory roles through phosphorylation. Phosphorylation-mimicking modifications at specific residues can modulate GEN1's activity, suggesting a regulatory mechanism for DNA recognition and cleavage (Lee2015Human). GEN1 may also interact with chromatin remodelers like CHD4, which is recruited to decondense chromatin in response to DNA damage (Lee2015Human). Additionally, GEN1 interacts with the BTR complex and MUS81-EME1, and its activity is spatially regulated to ensure genome stability, particularly during mitosis (Chan2014Spatial). These interactions highlight GEN1's role in DNA maintenance pathways and its potential involvement in processing fragile sites to ensure proper chromosome segregation (Lee2015Human).
