# FUT7

## Overview
FUT7, or fucosyltransferase 7, is a gene that encodes the enzyme fucosyltransferase 7, which is a member of the glycosyltransferase family. This enzyme is primarily involved in the fucosylation of oligosaccharide-containing ligands, a critical modification for selectin-mediated cell adhesion processes. Fucosyltransferase 7 is categorized as an α(1,3) fucosyltransferase and is essential for the synthesis of sialyl-Lewis X (SLe^x) oligosaccharides, which play a significant role in leukocyte trafficking and immune cell interactions. The enzyme operates predominantly within the Golgi apparatus, utilizing GDP-fucose to modify target molecules, thereby influencing various biological functions such as development and immune response. The activity of FUT7 is crucial for normal immune function, as it facilitates leukocyte adhesion and migration, processes that are vital for effective immune surveillance and response (Schneider2017Biological).

## Function
FUT7 (fucosyltransferase 7) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the fucosylation of oligosaccharide-containing ligands, which are essential for leukocyte trafficking. This enzyme is one of the two α(1,3) fucosyltransferases responsible for adding fucose residues to these ligands, a modification necessary for selectin-dependent endothelial cell adhesion and lymphocyte homing. The fucose modifications on glycolipid E-selectin receptors are crucial for neutrophil extravasation during inflammation, highlighting FUT7's role in immune cell trafficking (Schneider2017Biological).

FUT7 is primarily active in the Golgi apparatus, where it utilizes GDP-fucose to modify target proteins or lipids. This process is important for various biological functions, including development and immunity. The enzyme's activity contributes to the synthesis of sialyl-Lewis X (SLe x) oligosaccharides, which are involved in cell-cell adhesion and are significant in both normal and pathological processes (Schneider2017Biological).

Inactivation of FUT7 can lead to a severe deficit in selectin-dependent adhesion, underscoring its essential role in maintaining normal immune function. Despite its critical functions, the loss of FUT7 is not lethal in mice, suggesting some redundancy in its biological roles (Schneider2017Biological).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the FUT7 gene have significant clinical implications. FUT7 is crucial for the synthesis of sialyl Lewis X, a carbohydrate structure that plays a vital role in leukocyte adhesion and migration. Disruptions in FUT7 expression can lead to impaired immune responses, as leukocytes may struggle to adhere and migrate effectively, potentially resulting in immune deficiencies. Such deficiencies can compromise the body's ability to fight infections and respond to inflammatory stimuli.

Altered FUT7 expression has also been linked to inflammatory diseases. In these conditions, the dysregulation of leukocyte adhesion and migration can exacerbate inflammation, contributing to disease progression and severity. Furthermore, changes in FUT7 activity have been associated with cancer metastasis. The enzyme's role in cell adhesion and migration is critical in the metastatic spread of cancer cells, where altered expression or function of FUT7 can facilitate the dissemination of cancer cells to distant sites in the body.

Overall, the clinical significance of FUT7 is underscored by its involvement in key physiological processes, and its dysregulation can lead to a range of pathological conditions, including immune deficiencies, inflammatory diseases, and cancer metastasis.
