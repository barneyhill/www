# TAC1

## Overview
The TAC1 gene encodes the tachykinin precursor 1 protein, which is a precursor to several neuropeptides, including substance P (SP) and neurokinin A (NKA). These neuropeptides are integral to various physiological processes, particularly in the nervous and immune systems, where they modulate pain perception, inflammation, and smooth muscle contraction. The TAC1 protein is categorized as a precursor protein that undergoes post-translational modifications and alternative splicing, resulting in multiple peptide variants with distinct biological functions (Page2005New). The gene is expressed in diverse tissues such as the brain, heart, and colon, and its expression is tightly regulated to meet the specific physiological demands of each tissue (Page2005New). The TAC1 gene and its peptide products are implicated in various clinical conditions, including neurodevelopmental disorders and chronic pain, highlighting their significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Aldinger2013Comparative; Ben2022Deletion).

## Structure
The TAC1 gene encodes a precursor protein that is processed into several neuropeptides, including substance P (SP) and neurokinin A (NKA). The primary structure of the TAC1 protein consists of a sequence of amino acids that undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and amidation (Page2005New). The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different splice variants, including αTAC1, βTAC1, γTAC1, and δTAC1, which lead to the production of distinct peptides. For instance, the γTAC1 variant includes both SP and NKA, while βTAC1 produces SP alone (Page2005New).

The secondary structure of the TAC1 protein may include alpha helices and beta sheets, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure involves the overall 3D folding of the protein, which is crucial for its interaction with tachykinin receptors NK1, NK2, and NK3 (Page2005New). The TAC1 protein does not have a quaternary structure as it functions as a single polypeptide chain.

The TAC1 gene is expressed in various human tissues, including the brain, heart, and colon, but not in the placenta (Page2005New). The expression and processing of TAC1 are tissue-specific, influencing the physiological roles of its peptide products.

## Function
The TAC1 gene encodes preprotachykinin-1, which is processed into several neuropeptides, including substance P (SP) and neurokinin A (NKA). These peptides are involved in a variety of physiological processes in healthy human cells. They primarily interact with neurokinin receptors, such as NK1, NK2, and NK3, which are G-protein-coupled receptors (Corcoran2008Stromalderived). 

Substance P and neurokinin A play significant roles in neurotransmission, modulating pain perception, inflammation, and smooth muscle contraction. They are expressed throughout the nervous and immune systems, regulating processes like inflammation, nociception, and epithelial secretion (Steinhoff2014Tachykinins). In the skin, these tachykinins are released from sensory nerves and act on keratinocytes, promoting cytokine and chemokine release, influencing vasoregulation, and contributing to wound healing (Steinhoff2014Tachykinins).

In the gastrointestinal tract, substance P is involved in contracting circular muscle in the colon and protecting colonocytes from apoptosis, while also promoting collagen synthesis and angiogenic factors, aiding in tissue repair (Steinhoff2014Tachykinins). These activities highlight the gene's involvement in both maintaining normal physiological functions and responding to stress or injury.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TAC1 gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions. In the context of neurodevelopmental disorders, TAC1 has been identified as a target gene of MeCP2, a protein associated with Rett syndrome (RTT). Alterations in TAC1 expression, particularly in the cingulate cortex, have been observed in individuals with RTT and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) with seizures, suggesting a role in the pathophysiology of these conditions (Aldinger2013Comparative). DNA methylation patterns of the TAC1 promoter region have been linked to differential expression in these disorders, indicating that epigenetic regulation may contribute to their clinical manifestations (Aldinger2013Comparative).

In the realm of pain and inflammatory responses, the deletion of the Tac1 gene in mice has been shown to affect kinase phosphorylation pathways, leading to altered nociceptive pain responses. This suggests that TAC1 plays a significant role in pain signaling and inflammation, with potential implications for chronic pain conditions (Ben2022Deletion). Additionally, a novel duplication involving the entire TAC1 gene has been identified in ASD patients, highlighting its potential involvement in synaptic transmission and neurodevelopmental processes (Bitar2019Identification).

## Interactions
The TAC1 gene encodes the protachykinin-1 protein, which is processed into active neuropeptides such as substance P (SP), neurokinin A (NKA), and neurokinin B (NKB). These peptides are involved in nociceptive transmission and interact with neurokinin receptors, primarily NK1R, to mediate pain signaling pathways (Ben2022Deletion). The deletion of the Tac1 gene in mice has been shown to affect kinase phosphorylation, impacting signaling pathways associated with pain, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and tyrosine kinase pathways. These pathways are crucial for neural plasticity and inflammation regulation (Ben2022Deletion).

In the context of osteoarthritis, TAC1 has been identified as having significant interactions with other proteins, as it holds the highest degree in a protein-protein interaction network constructed from differentially expressed genes in osteoarthritis patients. This suggests that TAC1 may play a critical role in the protein interaction landscape relevant to osteoarthritis pathology (Zhu2014Proteinprotein).

In Drosophila, the TAC1 chromatin-modifying complex is involved in the regulation of heat shock gene expression. It interacts with the Trithorax (Trx) protein, a histone methyltransferase, and CREB-binding protein (CBP), which have histone-modifying activities essential for transcriptional activation during the heat shock response (Smith2004Modulation).
