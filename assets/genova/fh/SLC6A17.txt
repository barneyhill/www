# SLC6A17

## Overview
SLC6A17 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 6 member 17, also known as B0AT3, which is a transmembrane transporter protein. This protein is part of the solute carrier family 6, characterized by its 12 transmembrane domains that facilitate the transport of neutral amino acids across cell membranes, particularly in the central nervous system (CNS) (Hägglund2013Characterization; Freissmuth2017SLC6). SLC6A17 is predominantly expressed in neurons, including glutamatergic and some GABAergic neurons, where it plays a crucial role in synaptic transmission and neurotransmitter regulation (Hägglund2013Characterization). The protein's activity is essential for maintaining neurotransmitter balance, impacting cognitive and neurological functions, and it is implicated in various physiological processes, including synaptic remodeling and response to antidepressant treatments (Hägglund2013Characterization). Mutations in the SLC6A17 gene have been linked to autosomal recessive intellectual disability, highlighting its clinical significance (Yahyaoui2019Amino).

## Structure
The SLC6A17 protein, also known as B0AT3, is a member of the solute carrier family 6 and is characterized by 12 transmembrane domains, a common feature of this transporter family (Freissmuth2017SLC6). These domains facilitate the transport of neutral amino acids across cell membranes, with a preference for proline, leucine, glycine, alanine, and glutamine (Hägglund2013Characterization). The protein is primarily expressed in the brain, particularly in axon terminals of glutamatergic and some GABAergic neurons, indicating its role in synaptic transmission (Hägglund2013Characterization).

The folding of SLC6A17 involves the adoption of α-helical structures by hydrophobic segments, which are crucial for its integration into the ER membrane. The C-terminus plays a significant role in stabilizing the hydrophobic core, and its interaction with the first intracellular loop is essential for proper folding (Freissmuth2017SLC6). Misfolding due to mutations, particularly at the protein-lipid interface, can lead to ER retention and loss of surface expression (Freissmuth2017SLC6).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation may occur, affecting the protein's function and localization. Variants of SLC6A17 can arise from alternative splicing, potentially influencing its transport activity and expression patterns (Hägglund2013Characterization).

## Function
The SLC6A17 gene encodes the B0AT3 transporter, a member of the solute carrier family 6, which is primarily involved in the transport of neutral amino acids across cell membranes in the central nervous system (CNS) (Hägglund2013Characterization). This transporter is expressed exclusively in neurons, including both glutamatergic and subsets of GABAergic neurons, and is localized in axon terminals and synapses, indicating its role in neurotransmitter transport and synaptic function (Hägglund2013Characterization).

B0AT3 is involved in the regulation of monoaminergic and glutamatergic synapses, with its expression being upregulated in response to food deprivation and treatment with antidepressants, suggesting a role in synaptic remodeling and the action of antidepressant drugs (Hägglund2013Characterization). The transporter is also implicated in the transport of branched-chain amino acids, L-methionine, and L-proline, with a proposed co-transport mechanism involving Na+ ions (Rudnick2013The).

The activity of SLC6A17 is crucial for maintaining neurotransmitter balance, impacting cognitive and neurological functions. Its expression in various brain regions, such as the hippocampus and hypothalamus, suggests a significant role in neuronal function and potentially in body weight homeostasis (Hägglund2013Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC6A17 gene have been associated with autosomal recessive intellectual disability. A study identified two missense variants in this gene linked to intellectual disability in two families from different ethnic backgrounds. The clinical features observed in affected individuals include moderate-to-severe intellectual disability, nearly no speech development, progressive tremors, behavioral problems, and severely impaired motor development that may prevent independent walking. No distinctive facial phenotypes were noted in these cases (Yahyaoui2019Amino).

Alterations in the expression of SLC6A17, also known as the B0AT3 transporter, have been studied in the context of its potential involvement in psychiatric conditions. Although the physiological function of B0AT3 is not fully understood, it is hypothesized to play a role in depression and the action of antidepressant drugs, similar to other SLC6 family members like SLC6A15, which is associated with major depression (Hägglund2013Characterization). The expression of SLC6A17 is influenced by conditions such as food deprivation and treatment with antidepressant drugs like fluoxetine and bupropion, which affect the serotonin and dopamine/noradrenaline systems (Hägglund2013Characterization). These findings suggest that SLC6A17 may be involved in synaptic remodeling and neurotransmitter regulation, potentially impacting psychiatric and neurological conditions.

## Interactions
SLC6A17, also known as NTT4, is part of the solute carrier family 6 and is primarily expressed in neurons of the brain and eye. It is involved in the transport of branched-chain amino acids, L-methionine, and L-proline, with a proposed co-transport stoichiometry of 1:1 with Na+ (Rudnick2013The). While specific physical interactions of SLC6A17 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, it is noted that KLHL36 uniquely interacts with both SLC6A15 and SLC6A17 in the SLC-interactome dataset (Frommelt2024The). This suggests a potential regulatory or stabilizing role for KLHL36 in relation to SLC6A17, similar to its role with SLC6A15, where it acts as a cullin-based E3 ligase adaptor (Frommelt2024The). However, the exact nature of SLC6A17's interactions remains to be fully elucidated, as the available data does not provide specific information on its physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids (Rudnick2013The).
