# AK9

## Overview
AK9 is a gene that encodes the protein adenylate kinase 9, which is a member of the adenylate kinase family of enzymes. This protein plays a crucial role in cellular nucleotide metabolism by catalyzing the phosphorylation of various nucleotides, thereby contributing to the synthesis of nucleoside triphosphates essential for numerous cellular processes (Panayiotou2014The). Adenylate kinase 9 exhibits both adenylate kinase and nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) activities, allowing it to participate in the regulation of energy homeostasis within the cell. The protein is localized in both the cytosol and the nucleus, facilitating its involvement in energy-demanding processes such as gene expression (Ionescu2019Adenylate; Fujisawa2023Regulation). Mutations in the AK9 gene have been linked to limb-girdle myasthenia, highlighting its clinical significance in neuromuscular disorders (Lam2016Limb).

## Function
AK9 (adenylate kinase 9) is an enzyme that plays a significant role in nucleotide metabolism by catalyzing the phosphorylation of AMP, dAMP, CMP, and dCMP using ATP as a phosphate donor, and primarily CMP when GTP is used. It also exhibits nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) activity, efficiently catalyzing the production of various triphosphates, including ATP, CTP, GTP, UTP, dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and TTP, with a preferential substrate order of CDP > UDP > ADP > GDP > TDP (Panayiotou2014The). This dual role in nucleotide metabolism suggests that AK9 contributes to the synthesis of nucleoside triphosphates, which are essential for various cellular processes.

AK9 is localized in both the cytosol and the nucleus, lacking specific targeting signals, which allows it to diffuse freely between these compartments (Ionescu2019Adenylate; Panayiotou2014The). This localization is significant as the nucleus requires substantial energy for activities related to gene expression, and AK9 is thought to be involved in regulating adenine nucleotide metabolism in this compartment (Fujisawa2023Regulation). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining the homeostasis of intracellular nucleotide metabolism, necessary for growth, differentiation, and motility (Fujisawa2023Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AK9 gene have been implicated in limb-girdle myasthenia, a condition characterized by muscle weakness. The study by Lam et al. identified a novel single nucleotide variant (SNV) in the AK9 gene, NM_001145128.2:c.332-14A4G, which is predicted to affect protein function by potentially altering splicing or introducing a cryptic start codon. This variant was found in affected individuals but not in unaffected ones, suggesting its role in the disease (Lam2016Limb). The AK9 gene acts as a disease modifier in conjunction with mutations in the RAPSN gene, affecting neuromuscular transmission by reducing nucleotide sugars necessary for the N-glycosylation pathway. This reduction impacts the co-clustering of acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction, contributing to myasthenic symptoms (Lam2016Limb).

The study also suggests that the nucleotide deficiency associated with AK9 mutations might be addressed through dietary supplements, potentially enhancing N-glycosylation and providing a therapeutic option for patients with congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS) (Lam2016Limb). These findings highlight the clinical significance of AK9 mutations in neuromuscular disorders and suggest potential avenues for treatment.
