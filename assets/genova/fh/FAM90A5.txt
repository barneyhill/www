# FAM90A5

## Overview
FAM90A5 is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 90, member A5. This protein is part of a larger family characterized by shared sequence motifs, although the specific biological functions of FAM90A5 remain to be fully elucidated. The protein encoded by FAM90A5 is not currently categorized under any specific functional class such as kinases, receptors, or transmembrane proteins, indicating that its role may be unique or not yet fully understood within cellular processes. Research into the FAM90A5 gene and its protein product is ongoing, with studies aiming to uncover its potential interactions and implications in various biological pathways and diseases (Qiu2020aarFDC).
