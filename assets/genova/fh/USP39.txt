# USP39

## Overview
USP39, or ubiquitin-specific peptidase 39, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the spliceosome complex, a critical component of the cellular machinery responsible for pre-mRNA splicing. Despite being classified within the deubiquitinating enzyme family, the protein encoded by USP39 lacks catalytic activity due to the absence of essential catalytic residues (Yan2019Ubiquitinspecific). Instead, it plays a pivotal role in the assembly of the mature spliceosome complex and the maintenance of the mitotic spindle checkpoint, thereby influencing cell cycle regulation and RNA processing (Xing2018Downregulation; Lin2016Ubiquitinspecific). USP39 is also implicated in various oncogenic processes, being overexpressed in several cancers, including ovarian, breast, colorectal, and lung cancers, where it contributes to tumorigenesis and poor prognosis (Huang2022Emerging; Yan2019Ubiquitinspecific). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as STAT1 and CHK2, further underscore its significance in both normal cellular functions and disease states (Wu2019USP39; Peng2020USP39).

## Structure
Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 39 (USP39) is a 65-kDa protein that is part of the deubiquitinating enzyme family, although it lacks catalytic activity due to missing catalytic residues (Yan2019Ubiquitinspecific). The protein structure includes a central zinc finger and two ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase domains. Its N-terminal domain is rich in arginine, serine, and glutamic acids, resembling the RS domain of SR-related proteins, which is crucial for recruiting the tri-snRNP to the pre-spliceosome (Yan2019Ubiquitinspecific). USP39 is involved in pre-mRNA splicing and the assembly of the mature spliceosome complex, playing a critical role in maintaining the integrity of the mitotic spindle checkpoint (Xing2018Downregulation; Lin2016Ubiquitinspecific).

The protein is associated with oncogenic functions in various cancers, including ovarian, breast, colorectal, and lung cancers, where it is often overexpressed (Xing2018Downregulation; Huang2022Emerging; Yan2019Ubiquitinspecific; Lin2016Ubiquitinspecific). While specific details on post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms are not provided, these factors may influence its function. The protein's involvement in spliceosome assembly and its structural domains suggest its importance in RNA processing and cell cycle regulation.

## Function
USP39 is a crucial component of the spliceosome complex, specifically involved in pre-mRNA splicing. It plays a significant role in the recruitment of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP to the pre-spliceosome, which is essential for the splicing function, although it is not required for the stability of the tri-snRNP itself (Cui2023Spliceosome). USP39 is involved in the alternative splicing of several genes, including those related to autophagy, such as Heat shock transcription factor 1 (Hsf1). This regulation is vital for maintaining cellular processes like autophagy and lipid homeostasis in the liver (Cui2023Spliceosome).

In the context of mitosis, USP39 is essential for maintaining the integrity of the mitotic spindle checkpoint. It influences the mRNA levels of Aurora B, a critical component for proper chromosome segregation and spindle checkpoint function (van2008Usp39). Despite having a deubiquitinating domain, USP39 lacks the necessary residues for protease activity, suggesting its primary function is related to mRNA processing rather than deubiquitination (van2008Usp39).

USP39 also plays a role in epithelial morphogenesis by interacting with planar cell polarity components and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways, which are crucial for processes like eyelid closure and epidermal differentiation (KimuraYoshida2022USP39).

## Clinical Significance
USP39 is implicated in various cancers due to its role in mRNA splicing and cell cycle regulation. In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), particularly clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), USP39 is highly expressed compared to normal renal tissues. This overexpression is associated with a lower survival rate and shorter median survival duration, making it an independent risk factor for RCC patient survival (Pan2021USP39). In KRAS-driven cancers, such as lung and colorectal cancers, USP39 is essential for the survival of KRAS-dependent cancer cells. Its expression correlates with KRAS levels and poor prognosis, suggesting a synthetic lethal interaction between USP39 and KRAS (Fraile2017USP39).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), USP39 overexpression is linked to poor prognosis and aggressive tumor characteristics. It is associated with adverse clinicopathological features and is involved in cell cycle and DNA replication pathways (Zheng2023USP39; Ni2021Identification). In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), high USP39 expression correlates with shorter overall and progression-free survival, promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Zhu2022The). A meta-analysis of solid cancers found that high USP39 expression is significantly associated with poor overall survival and disease-free survival, as well as with lymph node metastasis and vascular invasion (Remitha2023Clinicopathological).

## Interactions
USP39 is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It interacts with STAT1, a key molecule in type I interferon (IFN) signaling, where it stabilizes STAT1 by decreasing its K6-linked ubiquitination, enhancing antiviral efficacy (Peng2020USP39). USP39 also binds to CHK2, a kinase involved in DNA damage response, stabilizing it by deubiquitination, which is essential for cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Wu2019USP39).

In the context of cancer, USP39 interacts with several proteins to promote tumorigenesis. It stabilizes the SP1 transcription factor in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, influencing cell proliferation and survival (Dong2021USP39). USP39 is also part of the spliceosome complex, interacting with RNA-binding proteins like SRSF6 and HNRNPC to regulate alternative splicing in HCC, affecting exon inclusion/exclusion in genes such as KANK2 and NEK6 (Zheng2023USP39).

In multiple myeloma, USP39 stabilizes the transcription factor ZEB1, enhancing the migratory potential of cancer cells (Sirera2024Disrupting). These interactions highlight USP39's role in various cellular pathways, contributing to its involvement in both normal cellular functions and disease states.
