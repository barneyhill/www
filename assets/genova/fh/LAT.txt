# LAT

## Overview
The LAT (Linker for Activation of T cells) gene encodes a transmembrane adaptor protein that is pivotal in the signaling pathways of T cells. This protein, characterized as a type III transmembrane protein, plays a crucial role in the immune response by acting as a scaffold for the assembly of signaling complexes upon T cell receptor (TCR) activation. LAT is rapidly phosphorylated on multiple tyrosine residues, facilitating interactions with various signaling molecules, which are essential for the propagation of downstream signaling pathways critical for T cell activation and function (Hořejší2004Transmembrane; Zhang1998LATa). Beyond T cells, LAT is also expressed in other immune cells, such as NK cells and mast cells, contributing to broader immune homeostasis (Hořejší2004Transmembrane). Mutations in the LAT gene can lead to severe immunological disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining immune balance (Keller2016Early; DinurSchejter2021The).

## Structure
The LAT (linker for activation of T cells) protein is a type III transmembrane protein with a predicted molecular mass of approximately 25 kDa, although it appears as 36-38 kDa on SDS-PAGE due to its acidic nature (Balagopalan2010The; Zhang1998LAT). It consists of 233 amino acids in humans, with a short extracellular region, a single transmembrane domain, and a long cytosolic domain (Balagopalan2010The). The transmembrane domain is formed by a hydrophobic region between residues 5 and 27, likely as an α-helical structure (Zhang1998LAT; Wange2000LAT).

The cytosolic domain contains multiple tyrosine residues, nine of which are conserved across species and serve as phosphorylation sites upon T cell receptor (TCR) activation (Balagopalan2010The; Zhang1998LAT). These phosphorylated tyrosines create docking sites for SH2 domain-containing proteins, facilitating the assembly of signaling complexes (Wange2000LAT).

LAT undergoes post-translational modifications, including palmitoylation at cysteine residues C26 and C29, which is crucial for its localization to glycolipid-enriched microdomains (GEMs) and efficient tyrosine phosphorylation (Zhang1998LATa; Wange2000LAT). The protein lacks intrinsic enzymatic activity and recognized functional domains but acts as a scaffold for signaling molecules (Balagopalan2010The; Wange2000LAT). There is also an alternative splice variant that adds 29 amino acids, potentially affecting its function (Wange2000LAT).

## Function
The LAT (Linker for Activation of T cells) gene encodes a transmembrane adaptor protein that plays a crucial role in T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. Upon TCR engagement, LAT is rapidly phosphorylated on multiple tyrosine residues, which is essential for its function in signal transduction. This phosphorylation allows LAT to serve as a scaffold for the assembly of multiprotein signaling complexes at the plasma membrane, facilitating the recruitment of various signaling molecules such as Grb2, PLC-γ1, and the p85 subunit of PI3K (Zhang1998LATa; Zhang2000Association). These interactions activate downstream pathways, including the RAS-ERK and PLC-γ1 pathways, which are critical for T cell activation and function (Hořejší2004Transmembrane).

LAT is involved in the regulation of T cell development, particularly during the transition from the DN3 to DN4 stage in pre-TCR signaling and from the DP to SP stage in mature TCR signaling (Balagopalan2010The). In addition to its role in T cells, LAT is also expressed in other immune cells such as NK cells and mast cells, where it contributes to immune homeostasis and signaling (Hořejší2004Transmembrane). The proper function of LAT is essential for maintaining immune balance and preventing autoimmune diseases (Hořejší2004Transmembrane).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LAT gene can lead to significant clinical outcomes, primarily affecting the immune system. A homozygous mutation in exon 5 of the LAT gene results in a premature stop codon, truncating the protein and deleting most of its cytoplasmic tail. This mutation is associated with early onset combined immunodeficiency and severe autoimmune disease, as it disrupts critical tyrosine residues necessary for T cell signaling (Keller2016Early; FernándezAguilar2023A). Patients with this mutation exhibit symptoms such as hypergammaglobulinemia, elevated IgE levels, and reduced NK cells, indicating severe immune dysregulation (Keller2016Early).

The LAT Y136F mutation, studied in murine models, leads to a lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by excessive Th2 cytokine production and autoimmunity. This mutation uncouples TCR signaling from PLC-γ1-calcium-dependent pathways, resulting in defective Fas-mediated cell death and altered cytokine production (Mingueneau2009Loss; Sommers2002A). In humans, LAT mutations can cause severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and autoimmune disorders, with patients experiencing recurrent infections and severe autoimmune cytopenias (DinurSchejter2021The). These findings underscore the critical role of LAT in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing immune-related disorders.

## Interactions
The LAT (Linker for Activation of T cells) protein is a critical adaptor in T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling, facilitating interactions with various signaling molecules. LAT is phosphorylated by the kinase ZAP70, creating docking sites for several proteins, including Grb2, Gads, and PLC-γ1, which are essential for forming the LAT signalosome. This multiprotein complex is crucial for downstream signaling pathways, such as calcium fluxes and the activation of the transcription factor NFAT (PAZ2001Mapping; FernándezAguilar2023A).

LAT interacts with Lck, a kinase that acts as a scaffold, bridging ZAP70 to LAT and enhancing LAT phosphorylation. This interaction is mediated by the SH3 domain of Lck binding to the PIPRSP motif in LAT, which is crucial for effective TCR signaling and T-cell development (Lo2018Lck). The phosphorylation of LAT's tyrosine residues, particularly Tyr132, is vital for recruiting PLC-γ1, a key signaling molecule in T-cell activation (PAZ2001Mapping).

Mutations in LAT, such as those affecting the PIPRSP motif or specific tyrosine residues, can disrupt these interactions, leading to impaired T-cell signaling and development (Lo2018Lck; FernándezAguilar2023A). These interactions underscore LAT's role as a central hub in TCR signaling, coordinating the assembly of signaling complexes necessary for T-cell activation.
