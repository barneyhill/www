# XPC

## Overview
The XPC gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, specifically involved in the global genome NER (GG-NER) subpathway. The XPC protein, categorized as a DNA damage recognition and repair factor, plays a pivotal role in identifying and binding to DNA lesions that cause significant distortion of the DNA helix, such as those induced by ultraviolet (UV) light. It forms a trimeric complex with RAD23B and CETN2, which is essential for its function in DNA repair. This complex initiates the repair process by recruiting other NER components, including TFIIH, XPA, and RPA, to the site of damage. Beyond its role in NER, XPC is also implicated in the base excision repair (BER) pathway, addressing oxidative DNA damage and influencing cellular stress responses. Mutations in the XPC gene are associated with xeroderma pigmentosum, a condition marked by extreme UV sensitivity and a heightened risk of skin cancers, underscoring the gene's importance in maintaining genomic stability and preventing cancer (Dupuy2015DNA; Melis2011The; Zebian2022XPC; Cleaver2005Cancer).

## Structure
The XPC protein is a crucial component of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, responsible for DNA damage recognition. Its molecular structure includes several distinct domains that facilitate its function. XPC is composed of four globular domains: one transglutaminase-homology domain (TGD) and three β-hairpin domains (BHDs) (Kim2023Lesion). The TGD domain features a large, positively charged insertion of 180 residues, which is unstructured and likely involved in DNA binding (Kim2023Lesion). The β-hairpin domains, particularly BHD2 and BHD3, play a role in recognizing DNA lesions by creating a DNA bubble and flipping out bases on the non-lesion strand (Kim2023Lesion).

The XPC protein also interacts with other components of the NER pathway, such as the p62 PH domain of the TFIIH complex. This interaction involves a series of acidic residues in XPC, which form electrostatic interactions with lysine residues in the p62 PH domain (Okuda2015Structural). Phosphorylation at Ser129 enhances the binding affinity of XPC to the p62 PH domain, which is crucial for the recruitment of TFIIH to DNA damage sites (Okuda2015Structural).

The XPC complex includes RAD23B and CETN2 subunits, forming a trimeric structure that is flexible and capable of binding various DNA substrates (Zhang2015Architecture). This flexibility is partly due to the disordered regions in RAD23B and the conformational adaptability of CETN2 (Zhang2015Architecture). The complex's structure is ear-shaped and undergoes conformational changes upon DNA binding (Zhang2015Architecture).

## Function
The XPC gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, specifically in the global genome NER (GG-NER) subpathway. This protein is essential for recognizing and binding to DNA lesions that cause significant distortion of the DNA helix, such as those induced by ultraviolet (UV) light, including cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and pyrimidine-(6,4)-pyrimidone products (6-4PP) (Dupuy2015DNA; Zebian2022XPC). The XPC protein forms a complex with HR23B and centrin 2, which identifies and binds to damaged DNA sites, initiating the repair process by recruiting other NER components like TFIIH, XPA, and RPA (Melis2011The; Cleaver2005Cancer).

XPC is not only involved in NER but also plays a role in the base excision repair (BER) pathway, which addresses oxidative DNA damage. It interacts with proteins such as OGG1 and APE1, influencing cellular stress responses and DNA repair efficiency (Fayyad2020Xeroderma). The XPC protein is primarily active in the cell nucleus, where it maintains genomic stability by facilitating the repair of DNA damage, thus preventing mutations and reducing cancer risk (Zebian2019XPC).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the XPC gene are associated with xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), a condition characterized by extreme sensitivity to UV light and a significantly increased risk of skin cancers, including non-melanoma skin cancer and melanoma (Bradford2010Cancer). Patients with XP-C often develop skin cancer at an early age due to defective DNA repair mechanisms (Bradford2010Cancer). Specific mutations, such as P334H, R579stop, and 697insVal, impair the nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) pathways, leading to increased sensitivity to UV radiation and oxidizing agents (Bernardes2008Dissection).

XPC deficiency is also linked to an increased risk of internal cancers, such as lung and liver tumors, as observed in XPC-deficient mouse models (Melis2011The). In humans, XPC mutations or polymorphisms are associated with a higher susceptibility to various cancers, including lung, liver, colon, bladder, breast, colorectal, and skin cancers (Melis2011The). The loss of XPC function can lead to genomic instability and increased mutation rates, contributing to cancer development (Hollander2005Deletion).

XPC deficiency is further implicated in hematologic malignancies, with XP-C patients showing a dramatically increased risk of leukemia, particularly myelodysplastic syndrome with secondary acute myeloid leukemia (Yurchenko2020XPC). This increased risk is attributed to a mutator phenotype and characteristic mutational signature associated with XPC deficiency (Yurchenko2020XPC).

## Interactions
The XPC protein is a crucial component of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, interacting with several proteins to facilitate DNA damage recognition and repair. XPC forms a trimeric complex with HR23B and CEN2 (centrin 2), which is essential for its stability and function in NER. HR23B enhances the activity of XPC by stabilizing it, particularly under conditions of heat stress, while CEN2 further assists in this stabilization (Araki2001Centrosome).

XPC also interacts with the transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) complex, which is critical for the recruitment of TFIIH to sites of DNA damage. This interaction is mediated through the XPB and p62 subunits of TFIIH, and is essential for the DNA unwinding necessary for repair. The XPC-HR23B complex plays a significant role in this recruitment process, although HR23B itself does not directly interact with TFIIH subunits (Yokoi2000The).

Additionally, XPC has been shown to interact with thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG), forming a ternary complex with TDG-bound DNA. This interaction, although relatively weak, suggests a potential role for XPC in base excision repair (BER) alongside its established function in NER (Shimizu2003Xeroderma).
