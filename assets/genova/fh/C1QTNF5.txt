# C1QTNF5

## Overview
C1QTNF5 is a gene that encodes the protein C1q and TNF related 5, which is a member of the C1q family of proteins. This protein is primarily expressed in the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) and plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity and cellular adhesion of the RPE. The C1QTNF5 protein is characterized by its ability to form trimeric and higher-order structures, such as octadecamers, which are essential for its function in cellular adhesion. It contains a globular C1q domain that interacts with collagen receptors, facilitating intercellular adhesion and contributing to the structural organization of the RPE. Mutations in the C1QTNF5 gene, such as the S163R mutation, are associated with late-onset retinal degeneration (L-ORD), a condition that leads to progressive visual impairment due to disrupted protein function and retinal degeneration (Tu2014The; Tu2012Crystal; Stanton2017Novel).

## Structure
The C1QTNF5 protein is a 25 kDa secreted and membrane-associated protein encoded by the C1QTNF5 gene. It is highly expressed in the retinal pigmented epithelium, ciliary body of the eye, and adipose tissue. The protein consists of three domains: a signal peptide domain (residues 1-15), a collagen domain (residues 30-98) with 23 uninterrupted Gly-X-Y repeats, and a globular C1q domain (gC1q domain, residues 103-243) (Tu2012Crystal).

The gC1q domain of C1QTNF5 forms a trimeric structure, characterized by a 10-strand jelly-roll fold arranged in two anti-parallel 5-stranded β-sheets. These β-sheets are crucial for the protein's tertiary structure, with conserved hydrophobic residues forming a 'zipper' that stabilizes the trimer (Tu2012Crystal). The trimerization is facilitated by a hydrophobic core formed by residues Y152, F230, and V232 (Tu2014The).

C1QTNF5 lacks Ca2+-binding sites, which are present in other C1q family members, and features a unique hydrophobic segment (F181, F182, G183, G184, W185, P186) that forms a hydrophobic plateau (Tu2012Crystal). The protein can form higher-order structures, such as octadecamers, composed of six trimers (Tu2014The). The S163R mutation in the gC1q domain disrupts hydrogen bonding, leading to protein instability and aggregation, which is associated with late-onset retinal macular degeneration (Tu2014The; Tu2012Crystal).

## Function
The C1QTNF5 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) by facilitating cellular adhesion and maintaining structural integrity. This protein is a member of the C1q family and is characterized by its ability to form trimeric and higher-order structures, such as bouquet-like octadecamers, which are essential for its adhesive function (Tu2014The; Stanton2017Novel). The C1QTNF5 protein contains a globular C1q domain that interacts with collagen receptors on adjacent RPE cell membranes, enhancing intercellular adhesion and filling gaps between cells and Bruch's membrane (Tu2014The).

In healthy cells, C1QTNF5 is secreted and associated with the membrane, where it contributes to the structural organization of the RPE by forming stable intermolecular interactions through a complex hydrogen-bond network (Tu2014The). This network is crucial for the protein's function in maintaining the integrity of the RPE cell layer, preventing lipid accumulation in the sub-RPE space, and supporting retinal health (Tu2014The; Tu2012Crystal). The protein's unique hydrophobic and electrostatic properties facilitate its adhesion to RPE plasma membranes, underscoring its role in cellular adhesion and retinal function (Tu2012Crystal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the C1QTNF5 gene are associated with late-onset retinal degeneration (L-ORD), a rare autosomal dominant retinal dystrophy. This condition is characterized by progressive retinal degeneration, leading to severe visual impairment typically by the age of 50-60. Patients often experience delayed dark adaptation and night vision problems in middle life (De2021Longitudinal). The S163R mutation in C1QTNF5 is a well-documented cause of L-ORD, leading to protein instability and aggregation, which disrupts the adhesion of retinal pigmented epithelial cells to Bruch's membrane. This results in thick extracellular deposits of lipid-rich material, causing retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) dysfunction and photoreceptor cell death (Dinculescu2015Pathological; Tu2012Crystal).

Other mutations, such as P188T and G216C, have been identified and are thought to act in a dominant negative manner, affecting protein folding, stability, and secretion. These mutations lead to mis-localization and impaired function of the C1QTNF5 protein, contributing to the disease mechanism in L-ORD (Stanton2017Novel). The gene's role in cellular adhesion and extracellular matrix modification is crucial, and disruptions in these processes due to mutations can lead to the accumulation of subretinal deposits and RPE atrophy (De2021Longitudinal; Vincent2012THE).

## Interactions
The C1QTNF5 protein is involved in several critical interactions that influence its function, particularly in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). It can form bouquet-like octadecamers, which are essential for enhancing intercellular adhesion of RPE cells. This structural arrangement is facilitated by interactions between the globular heads of C1QTNF5, which are crucial for its adhesive function (Tu2014The). The S163R mutation in C1QTNF5 disrupts these interactions, leading to weakened adhesion and the accumulation of sub-RPE deposits (Tu2014The).

C1QTNF5 also interacts with the membrane frizzled-related protein (MFRP), suggesting roles beyond cellular adhesion. This interaction has been demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays, indicating a direct and specific binding between the two proteins (Tu2014The). The interaction with MFRP implies a functional collaboration, although the phenotypes of diseases associated with these genes differ (Tu2014The).

Additionally, C1QTNF5 is known to interact with complement factor H, a major genetic factor associated with age-related macular degeneration. This interaction suggests a role for C1QTNF5 in the immune response pathway, which is implicated in retinal degeneration (Chavali2010Identification).
