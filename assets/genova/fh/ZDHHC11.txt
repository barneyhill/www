# ZDHHC11

## Overview
ZDHHC11 is a gene that encodes the protein zinc finger DHHC-type containing 11, which is a member of the DHHC palmitoyl transferase family. This protein is involved in the post-translational modification process known as palmitoylation, where it facilitates the addition of palmitate to cysteine residues on target proteins, influencing their localization, stability, and function. ZDHHC11 is primarily active in the Golgi apparatus and plays a crucial role in cellular signaling and membrane trafficking. Notably, it is involved in the regulation of NF-κB signaling, a pathway essential for immune responses, inflammation, and cell proliferation, through its interaction with TRAF6. Despite its enzymatic role in palmitoylation, ZDHHC11's function in NF-κB activation is independent of its palmitoyl transferase activity. The gene's expression and activity have been linked to various diseases, including cancer and glaucoma, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular processes and pathological conditions (Lobo2019Protein; Hu2023ZDHHC11; Liu2021ZDHHC11).

## Function
ZDHHC11 is a member of the DHHC palmitoyl transferase family, which is involved in the post-translational modification process known as palmitoylation. This process involves the addition of palmitate, a fatty acid, to cysteine residues on proteins, affecting their localization, stability, and function. ZDHHC11 is primarily active in the Golgi apparatus and plays a significant role in cellular signaling and membrane trafficking (Hu2023ZDHHC11).

In healthy human cells, ZDHHC11 is known to regulate NF-κB signaling, a critical pathway for immune responses, inflammation, and cell proliferation. It enhances the oligomerization of TRAF6, a key component in the NF-κB pathway, thereby increasing NF-κB activation. This interaction is specific to the TRAF-C domain of TRAF6 and the C-terminal region of ZDHHC11. Interestingly, the palmitoyl transferase activity of ZDHHC11 is not required for its role in NF-κB activation, suggesting that its function in this context is independent of its enzymatic activity (Liu2021ZDHHC11).

ZDHHC11 also plays a role in modulating immune responses by enhancing TRAF6-mediated NF-κB signaling, which is crucial for inflammation and innate immunity (Liu2021ZDHHC11). This regulatory function highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and immune response regulation.

## Clinical Significance
ZDHHC11 has been implicated in various diseases, primarily due to its altered expression levels. In cancer, ZDHHC11 is considered oncogenic when overexpressed. It is located on chromosome 5 (5p15.33), a region frequently amplified in bladder cancer, especially in high-grade and advanced-stage cases, as well as in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The overexpression of ZDHHC11 is associated with cancer-related signaling pathways, suggesting its role in oncogenic processes, although specific mutations or interaction changes have not been detailed (Lobo2019Protein).

In the context of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), ZDHHC11 is identified as a gene potentially involved in the disease through copy number variation regions (CNVRs). These variations may affect the regulation of pathways such as the Wnt signaling pathway, which is crucial for maintaining intraocular pressure and optic nerve health. However, the clinical significance of ZDHHC11 mutations or expression changes in POAG requires further investigation (Lo2021Genomewide).

In gliomas, ZDHHC11 is noted as a favorable prognostic marker, indicating that its expression levels could be linked to patient outcomes. However, specific details on mutations or interaction changes in gliomas are not provided (Liao2024The).

## Interactions
ZDHHC11 interacts specifically with TRAF6, a tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor, to regulate NF-κB signaling. This interaction is crucial for promoting TRAF6 oligomerization, which enhances its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, leading to the synthesis of K63-linked polyubiquitination chains. These chains are essential for the activation of TAK1 kinase activity, which is a key step in NF-κB signaling (Liu2021ZDHHC11). The interaction between ZDHHC11 and TRAF6 is specific, as ZDHHC11 does not associate with other TRAF family members such as TRAF2, TRAF3, or TRAF5 (Liu2021ZDHHC11).

The C-terminal region of ZDHHC11 (198-412 amino acids) and the TRAF-C domain of TRAF6 are critical for their interaction (Liu2021ZDHHC11). ZDHHC11 enhances TRAF6-induced NF-κB activation and IL8 mRNA expression, indicating that TRAF6 is a target of ZDHHC11 in NF-κB signaling (Liu2021ZDHHC11). The palmitoyl transferase activity of ZDHHC11 is not required for its role in NF-κB activation, as mutants lacking this activity still activate NF-κB signaling (Liu2021ZDHHC11). This interaction is significant in the context of cancer, as NF-κB signaling is crucial in cancer initiation and progression (Liu2021ZDHHC11).
