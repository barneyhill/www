# CDCA3

## Overview
Cell division cycle associated 3 (CDCA3) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, particularly during the transition from the G1 to the S phase. The CDCA3 protein is a component of the Skp1-Cullin-F-box (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays a critical role in targeting specific proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation, thereby ensuring proper cell cycle progression and cellular proliferation (Uchida2012Overexpression; Shen2021The). Functioning primarily within the nucleus, CDCA3 is essential for triggering mitotic entry by mediating the degradation of mitosis inhibitory kinases, thus facilitating the transition from the G1 to the S phase (Zhang2019CDCA3). The protein's interactions with various cell cycle-related proteins underscore its significance in maintaining normal cellular functions and its potential implications in cancer progression and treatment (Sahin2024Evaluation; Shen2021The).

## Function
CDCA3, also known as cell division cycle associated protein 3, is a crucial component in cell cycle regulation, particularly in the transition from the G1 to the S phase. It is part of the Skp1-Cullin-F-box (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complex, which targets specific proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. This process is essential for maintaining proper cell cycle progression and cellular proliferation (Uchida2012Overexpression; Shen2021The).

In healthy human cells, CDCA3 plays a significant role in triggering mitotic entry by mediating the destruction of mitosis inhibitory kinases. This activity is part of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is vital for cellular protein homeostasis by controlling protein turnover (Uchida2012Overexpression). CDCA3 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences cell division and growth by promoting the degradation of cell cycle inhibitors, thus facilitating the transition from the G1 to the S phase (Zhang2019CDCA3).

The protein's function is critical for ensuring proper cell division and mitosis, as it regulates the dephosphorylation of CDC2 protein in the G2 phase, triggering cells to enter mitosis (Shen2021The). This regulation is crucial for maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CDCA3 gene have been implicated in various cancers, where it often acts as an oncogene. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), CDCA3 expression is significantly elevated in malignant tissues compared to non-malignant tissues, correlating with poorer overall survival. This is particularly evident in EGFR-mutant NSCLC, where high CDCA3 expression is associated with resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and impacts autophagic flux, potentially influencing treatment outcomes (Sahin2024Evaluation).

In gastric cancer, CDCA3 is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues, promoting cell proliferation and progression through the cell cycle. High CDCA3 expression is linked to larger tumor size, poor differentiation, and advanced disease stages, serving as an independent prognostic indicator for poor survival (Zhang2019CDCA3).

CDCA3 is also upregulated in breast cancer, particularly in invasive ductal carcinoma, where it is associated with shorter relapse-free survival and poor prognosis. Its overexpression is linked to cell cycle dysregulation, contributing to tumor progression (Phan2018Distinct).

In NSCLC, CDCA3 expression correlates with genomic instability and sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy, suggesting its potential role in predicting chemotherapy response (Kildey2021Elevating).

## Interactions
CDCA3 is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cell cycle regulation and cancer progression. In bladder urothelial carcinoma, CDCA3 interacts with cell cycle-related proteins such as BUB1, CCNB1, CDC25C, PTTG1, and CDC45, which are essential for cell cycle progression and mitosis (Shen2021The). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), CDCA3 is regulated by the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) with Cdh1 as a co-activator. This interaction is modulated by phosphorylation at specific serine residues, which is crucial for CDCA3 degradation (Kildey2021Elevating). CDCA3 also interacts with mTOR within the mTORC1 complex, affecting mTOR's localization and downstream signaling pathways, such as the phosphorylation of p70 S6K and 4E-BP1 (Sahin2024Evaluation). In prostate cancer, CDCA3 interacts with NF-κB signaling pathways, influencing proteins like NFκB-p105/p50 and IKKα/β, which are important for cell cycle regulation and cancer progression (Gu2021Suppression). These interactions highlight CDCA3's role in various cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer.
