# WHRN

## Overview
The WHRN gene encodes the whirlin protein, a multi-domain scaffolding protein that plays a pivotal role in sensory perception, particularly within the auditory and visual systems. Whirlin is characterized by its PDZ domains, which facilitate interactions with various proteins, thereby maintaining the structural integrity and function of sensory cells. It is crucial for the organization and elongation of stereocilia in the inner ear, interacting with proteins such as myosin XVa and espin, which are essential for hearing and balance (Delprat2004Myosin; Wang2011Whirlin). Additionally, whirlin is involved in the Usher protein network in the retina, contributing to photoreceptor cell organization and function (van2006The). Mutations in the WHRN gene are linked to auditory and visual disorders, including Usher syndrome type 2D and DFNB31, highlighting its clinical significance in sensory impairments (Mathur2019Usher).

## Structure
The WHRN (whirlin) protein is a multi-domain scaffolding protein essential for sensory perception, particularly in cochlear hair cells and photoreceptor cells. It is composed of 907 amino acids and includes two harmonin Homology Domains (HHD), three PDZ domains, a proline-rich (PR) region, and a C-terminal PDZ binding motif (PBM) (Zhu2020Deciphering). The PDZ domains are critical for organizing protein networks, with the PDZ1-2 tandem forming a dynamic supramodule that enhances affinity for partners, crucial for its role in sensory cells (Delhommel2017Structural). The PDZ1-2 domains have C-terminal hairpin extensions and exist in equilibrium between closed and open states, contributing to their dynamic nature (Delhommel2017Structural). The PDZ3 domain is characterized by a longer α2-helix, stabilized by a 'Lys-Phe lock', allowing it to bind diverse partners (Zhu2020Deciphering).

Whirlin is expressed in three main isoforms: the full-length (FL) isoform, the C-terminal isoform, and the N-terminal isoform, each with distinct functions and localizations (Zhu2020Deciphering). The HHD2 domain, shared by all isoforms, exhibits structural plasticity, existing as a monomeric five-helix bundle or a swapped dimer (Delhommel2018Structural). The PR region is predicted to be intrinsically disordered, linking the HHD2 and PDZ3 domains, which adopt compact conformations (Zhu2020Deciphering).

## Function
The WHRN gene encodes the protein whirlin, which plays a crucial role in the organization and function of stereocilia in the inner ear, essential for hearing and balance. Whirlin is a PDZ domain-containing scaffold protein that interacts with various proteins to maintain the structural integrity of stereocilia. It is involved in the elongation of stereocilia by interacting with myosin XVa, a process vital for proper auditory function (Delprat2004Myosin; van2006The).

Whirlin also interacts with espin, an actin-binding protein, modulating its actin-regulatory function. This interaction affects the mobility and dimensions of actin bundles, influencing the stability of actin structures within cells (Wang2011Whirlin). In the context of Usher syndrome type II, whirlin acts as a scaffold protein, recruiting other proteins to form a complex that maintains the actin bundle network in photoreceptors and hair cells (Wang2011Whirlin).

In addition to its role in the inner ear, whirlin is expressed in the retina, where it is part of the Usher protein network, contributing to the organization of photoreceptor cells. This network is crucial for synaptic organization and protein transport, linking whirlin to both auditory and visual functions (van2006The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the WHRN gene, which encodes the whirlin protein, are associated with several auditory and visual disorders. Usher syndrome type 2D (USH2D) is caused by mutations in the 5' region of WHRN, leading to congenital moderate hearing loss and retinitis pigmentosa, a progressive retinal degeneration that typically begins by age 20 (Mathur2019Usher). In contrast, mutations in the 3' region of the gene result in DFNB31, a form of profound sensorineural hearing loss without accompanying vision loss (van2006The; Mathur2019Usher).

Specific mutations, such as a cysteine to threonine substitution in exon 10 (R778X) and a mutation in exon 11 (G808DfsX11), are linked to DFNB31 (Mathur2019Usher). The WHRN gene is also implicated in autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL), although it is considered a rare cause in certain populations, such as the Tunisian population (Tlili2005Identification).

Mouse models have been instrumental in studying these mutations, with some models exhibiting profound deafness and others showing moderate hearing loss and progressive retinal degeneration, reflecting the human conditions of DFNB31 and USH2D, respectively (Ebrahim2016Alternative; Mathur2019Usher).

## Interactions
Whirlin, encoded by the WHRN gene, is a scaffold protein that participates in various protein-protein interactions crucial for sensory cell function. It interacts directly with the cytoplasmic tails of USH2A and VLGR1b, forming part of the Usher protein network, which is essential for the function of the cochlea and retina (van2006The). These interactions are mediated through whirlin's PDZ domains, with the PDZ1 domain binding to the C-terminal parts of USH2A and VLGR1b, while the PDZ2 domain shows some binding to USH2A (van2006The). Whirlin also interacts with myosin XVa, which is crucial for its localization at the tips of stereocilia in the inner ear (van2006The).

In photoreceptor cells, whirlin interacts with the L-type calcium channel subunit Ca v 1.3 (α1D), which is part of a heteromultimeric protein complex. This interaction involves the PDZ1 and PDZ2 domains of whirlin and is significant for the organization of calcium channels in photoreceptor cells (Kersten2010Association). Whirlin's interactions with these proteins suggest its role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of sensory cells in both the auditory and visual systems.
