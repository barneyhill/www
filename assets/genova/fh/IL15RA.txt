# IL15RA

## Overview
The IL15RA gene encodes the interleukin 15 receptor subunit alpha, a critical component of the immune system. This gene is responsible for producing a type I transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the high-affinity binding of interleukin-15 (IL-15), a cytokine involved in the activation and proliferation of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. The IL15RA protein is characterized by its extracellular sushi domain, which is essential for its interaction with IL-15, and it can exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing (Kennedy1996Characterization; Schluns2005The). Functionally, IL15RA is involved in the trans-presentation of IL-15, a unique mechanism that is crucial for the maintenance of memory CD8+ T cells and the development of NK cells (AllardChamard2020Interleukin15). Additionally, IL15RA can mediate signaling independently, providing anti-apoptotic signals in certain cell types (Bulfone‐Paus2006The). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its involvement in various diseases, including immunodeficiency and cancer, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (De2021IL15RA; He2021Phenotypic).

## Structure
The IL15RA protein is a type I membrane protein characterized by several distinct structural features. It includes a 32-amino acid signal sequence, a 173-amino acid extracellular domain, a 21-amino acid transmembrane domain, and a 37-amino acid cytoplasmic domain (Kennedy1996Characterization). The extracellular domain contains a sushi domain, which is crucial for high-affinity binding to interleukin-15 (IL-15) (Schluns2005The). This sushi domain has an ABCC’DE topology and is structurally similar to the amino-terminal sushi domain of the decay-accelerating factor (Chirifu2007Crystal).

The IL15RA protein can exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing events, which may involve the elimination of exon 2 (sushi domain), deletion of exon 3 (linker region), and alternate usage of exon 7 (cytoplasmic region) (Schluns2005The). These isoforms can affect the protein's binding and signaling properties.

In terms of quaternary structure, IL15RA forms a complex with IL-15, which is crucial for the cytokine's function. The IL-15-IL15RA complex is stabilized by van der Waals contacts, hydrogen bonds, and salt bridges, contributing to its high affinity and stability (Chirifu2007Crystal). The IL15RA protein is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which can influence its function and interactions (Sousa2019Mechanistic).

## Function
IL15RA (interleukin 15 receptor subunit alpha) is a critical component of the IL-15 receptor complex, which plays a significant role in the immune system by binding interleukin-15 (IL-15) with high affinity. This binding is essential for the biological activity of IL-15, which is involved in the activation and proliferation of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells (Kennedy1996Characterization). IL15RA is expressed in a wide variety of tissues and cell types, allowing IL-15 to have a broad range of cellular targets (Kennedy1996Characterization).

IL15RA is involved in the trans-presentation of IL-15, where it presents IL-15 to other cells, which is crucial for maintaining IL-15-dependent lymphocytes in vivo (AllardChamard2020Interleukin15). This trans-presentation mechanism is unique among cytokines and is essential for the generation and maintenance of memory CD8+ T cells, as well as the development of NK and NK/T cells (Schluns2005The). IL15RA can also function independently of other receptor subunits, recruiting TRAF2 and activating NF-kB, providing anti-apoptotic signals in certain cell types (Bulfone‐Paus2006The). This receptor is primarily active on the cell surface, where it facilitates signal transduction for immune responses.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IL15RA gene, which encodes the interleukin-15 receptor alpha (IL-15Rα), have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. IL15RA is crucial for immune response regulation, particularly in activating T, B, and natural killer cells. Variants in the IL15RA gene, such as rs7910212, have been identified as prognostic markers for overall survival in metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with FOLFIRI therapy. These genetic variations may impact tumor growth control and chemotherapy effectiveness, affecting patient prognosis (De2021IL15RA).

IL15RA insufficiency is linked to immunodeficiency, skeletal muscle variation, and neurological symptoms. In mice, IL15Rα knockout (KO) leads to increased neuroexcitability and reduced anxiety, suggesting a role in neuropsychiatric disorders. The deletion of IL15Rα affects various biological processes, including respiratory chain and skeletal muscle development, contributing to observed phenotypic changes (He2021Phenotypic).

In skeletal muscle, IL15Rα deficiency results in increased mitochondrial mass and enhanced exercise capacity, although it also causes structural alterations typical of mitochondrial pathologies. This suggests compensatory mitochondrial biogenesis due to IL15Rα-related impairments (O’Connell2015IL15Rα). These findings highlight the diverse roles of IL15RA in disease pathogenesis and potential therapeutic implications.

## Interactions
IL15RA, the interleukin 15 receptor subunit alpha, is a critical component of the IL-15 receptor complex, which also includes IL2RB and IL2RG. It binds interleukin-15 (IL-15) with high affinity, forming a complex that is essential for the cytokine's secretion and function. IL15RA is necessary for the membrane localization and secretion of IL-15, as demonstrated in studies using COS-7 cells, where IL-15 was only detected on the cell surface when coexpressed with IL15RA (Duitman2008How).

The IL-15/IL15RA complex is transported to the plasma membrane and released into the environment through proteolytic activity by matrix metalloproteinases. This interaction is crucial for IL-15's role as a membrane-associated cytokine, particularly in immunological synapses and cell-cell interactions, such as priming NK cells by dendritic cells (Duitman2008How).

IL15RA can also mediate signals independently of the IL-2/15Rβ and γc subunits in certain cells, such as colonic epithelial cells, by recruiting proteins like TRAF2 and associating with kinases like Syk and Axl. In T and NK cells, the βγc heterodimer is essential for signal transduction, and IL15RA is not required for their development and survival (Bodnár2008A).
