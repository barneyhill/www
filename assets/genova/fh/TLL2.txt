# TLL2

## Overview
TLL2 is a gene that encodes the tolloid-like 2 protein, a member of the BMP1/TLD-like metalloproteinase family. This protein is characterized by its role in the processing of extracellular matrix (ECM) components and tissue remodeling, functioning primarily as a metalloproteinase. Tolloid-like 2 is involved in the proteolytic maturation of ECM proteins, such as collagens and proteoglycans, which are crucial for proper ECM formation and tissue integrity (Ge2006Developmental). The protein is also known for its activity in processing and activating myostatin, a key regulator of skeletal muscle growth, suggesting its significant role in muscle development and regulation (Jiang2019Genomic). Structurally, TLL2 features a catalytic domain of the astacin M12A family, along with several CUB and EGF-like domains that facilitate protein-protein interactions (Hopkins2007The). Mutations in the TLL2 gene have been associated with modifying the severity of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Jiang2019Genomic).

## Structure
The TLL2 protein is a member of the mammalian tolloid proteinase family and is predominantly monomeric in solution, with a molecular mass of approximately 106.7 kDa, slightly larger than the predicted monomer mass of 98.58 kDa (Bayley2016Diversity). The protein features a catalytic domain characteristic of the astacin M12A family, along with several CUB and EGF-like domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions (Hopkins2007The). TLL2 has five N-linked glycans, indicating glycosylation as a post-translational modification, which is confirmed by a shift in mobility on SDS-PAGE after treatment with PNGaseF (Bayley2016Diversity).

Structurally, TLL2 is described as having an elongated and flexible shape, with a hydrodynamic radius of 4.8 nm and a sedimentation coefficient of 4.78 S, suggesting a slightly elongated monomeric protein (Bayley2016Diversity). Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and electron microscopy (EM) confirm the presence of monomeric and dimeric forms, with the monomer exhibiting an elongated asymmetric shape (Bayley2016Diversity). The presence of calcium ions stabilizes the monomeric form, although small amounts of higher molecular weight species, possibly dimers, are observed (Bayley2016Diversity). The non-catalytic domains, particularly CUB5, are crucial for TLL2's chordinase activity, indicating their role in substrate recognition and specificity (Bayley2016Diversity).

## Function
The TLL2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the BMP1/TLD-like metalloproteinase family, which plays a crucial role in the processing of extracellular matrix (ECM) components and tissue remodeling. TLL2 is involved in the proteolytic maturation of ECM proteins, including collagens and proteoglycans, which are essential for ECM formation. These metalloproteinases cleave the C-propeptides of procollagen, a process vital for proper fibrillogenesis, impacting tissue structure and function (Ge2006Developmental).

TLL2 is also known for its high in vitro activity in processing and activating myostatin, a negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth. This suggests a significant role in skeletal muscle development and regulation, potentially influencing muscle mass and growth (Ge2006Developmental; Jiang2019Genomic). In the context of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), mutations in TLL2 have been associated with modifying the severity of the disease, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Jiang2019Genomic).

The protein is active in the extracellular space, where it contributes to developmental processes by modulating signaling pathways, including those involved in muscle growth and ECM integrity (Ge2006Developmental; Jiang2019Genomic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TLL2 gene have been implicated in modifying the severity of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a genetic disorder characterized by the loss of motor neurons and progressive muscle wasting. In a study of a family with discordant SMA phenotypes, compound heterozygous mutations in TLL2 were identified in a male patient with a milder form of SMA (type III), while his sister, who had a more severe form (type I), did not have these mutations. This suggests that TLL2 mutations may act as genetic modifiers, potentially alleviating the severity of SMA by influencing muscle growth and function (Jiang2019Genomic).

TLL2 encodes a proteinase that activates myostatin, a myokine known to inhibit muscle cell growth and differentiation. Mutations in TLL2 may disrupt this pathway, leading to increased muscle function, as observed in mouse models. This potential to modify muscle growth makes TLL2 a candidate for therapeutic targeting in SMA and possibly other muscle-related conditions (Jiang2019Genomic).

Alterations in TLL2 expression or function could also be linked to developmental disorders and connective tissue diseases, given its role in extracellular matrix organization and development (Jiang2019Genomic).

## Interactions
TLL2, a member of the mammalian tolloid proteinase family, interacts with various proteins, influencing its enzymatic activity and substrate specificity. TLL2 is known to cleave chordin, a protein involved in developmental processes, through interactions mediated by its non-catalytic domains, particularly the CUB5 domain. This domain is crucial for TLL2's chordinase activity, suggesting a specific interaction between CUB5 and chordin (Bayley2016Diversity). 

TLL2 also participates in the activation of latent myostatin by cleaving its propeptide, a process shared with other BMP-1/tolloid family metalloproteinases. This interaction is significant for regulating myostatin activity, which plays a role in muscle growth inhibition (Wolfman2003Activation; Ge2006Developmental). 

In addition to these interactions, TLL2 has been implicated in modifying the severity of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) through its role in activating myostatin. Mutations in TLL2 may influence myostatin activity, potentially affecting muscle growth and SMA phenotypes (Jiang2019Genomic). These interactions highlight TLL2's involvement in critical biological processes through its interactions with other proteins.
