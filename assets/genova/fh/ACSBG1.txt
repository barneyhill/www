# ACSBG1

## Overview
ACSBG1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme acyl-CoA synthetase bubblegum family member 1, which belongs to the acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) family. This enzyme is integral to lipid metabolism, specifically in the activation of long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) into acyl-CoA derivatives, which are crucial for various cellular processes such as membrane biosynthesis, myelination, and energy production (Watkins2012Peroxisomal; Ye2024Role). The protein is predominantly expressed in the brain, adrenal gland, and testis, with notable expression in the cerebellum, and its levels increase during development, peaking in early postnatal stages in mice (Ye2024Role). While ACSBG1 is not directly implicated in genetic mutations causing X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (XALD), its role in lipid metabolism suggests it may influence the disease's metabolic profile (Ye2024Role). Additionally, ACSBG1 has been identified as a factor in cancer biology, affecting tumor sensitivity to ferroptosis, a type of cell death linked to lipid peroxidation (Chen2022Identification).

## Function
The ACSBG1 gene encodes an enzyme that is part of the acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) family, specifically known as the 'bubblegum' family. This enzyme plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism by activating long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) into acyl-CoA derivatives, which are essential for various metabolic processes, including membrane formation, myelination, and energy production (Watkins2012Peroxisomal; Ye2024Role). ACSBG1 is primarily expressed in the brain, adrenal gland, and testis, with the highest expression in the cerebellum, and its expression increases with development, peaking around two months of age in mice (Ye2024Role).

In healthy human cells, ACSBG1 is involved in the activation of long-chain fatty acids, such as palmitic acid (C16:0), but not very long-chain fatty acids like lignoceric acid (C24:0) (Ye2024Role). The enzyme's activity is vital for neuronal growth, synaptic plasticity, and overall brain development, maintaining lipid homeostasis and proper brain function (Ye2024Role). Despite its significant role in lipid metabolism, the exact function of ACSBG1 in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated (Watkins2012Peroxisomal).

## Clinical Significance
ACSBG1, also known as the 'bubblegum' acyl-CoA synthetase, plays a role in brain lipid metabolism and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (XALD). XALD is primarily caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene, which affects the degradation of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) in peroxisomes, leading to their accumulation in plasma and tissues. Although ACSBG1 itself is not directly mutated in XALD, its expression in tissues affected by the disease, such as the brain, adrenal glands, and testis, suggests it may contribute to the disease's metabolic disturbances (Ye2024Role).

In knockout mouse models, ACSBG1 deficiency led to altered fatty acid composition, with decreased levels of saturated VLCFA and increased omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in the cerebellum. This contrasts with the elevated VLCFA levels typically observed in XALD patients, indicating a complex relationship between ACSBG1 activity and XALD pathology (Ye2024Role). Additionally, ACSBG1 has been identified as a pro-ferroptotic factor in cancer, influencing tumor sensitivity to ferroptosis, a form of cell death associated with lipid peroxidation (Chen2022Identification).
