# HERC3

## Overview
HERC3 is a gene that encodes the protein HECT and RLD domain containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 3, which is a member of the HERC family of ubiquitin ligases. This protein is characterized by the presence of a HECT domain, which is essential for its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and an RCC1-like domain (RLD) that facilitates protein-protein interactions (Hochrainer2005The; Cruz2001HERC3). HERC3 is involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, playing a critical role in tagging proteins for degradation, thus maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating protein turnover (Zhang2022HERC3). The protein is ubiquitously expressed, with notable expression in the brain, and is primarily localized in the cytosol and vesicular structures, suggesting a role in intracellular trafficking (SánchezTena2016Functional). HERC3 has been implicated in various cellular processes, including the regulation of NF-κB signaling and the degradation of misfolded proteins, and has clinical significance in cancer and cystic fibrosis (Kamada2023HERC3; SánchezTena2016Functional).

## Structure
HERC3 is a member of the HERC family of ubiquitin ligases, characterized by the presence of a HECT (Homologous to the E6-AP Carboxyl Terminus) domain and an RCC1-like domain (RLD) (Hochrainer2005The; Cruz2001HERC3). The HECT domain is crucial for its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin to substrate proteins, which is essential for processes like proteasome-mediated proteolysis (Zhang2022HERC3; Cruz2001HERC3). The RLD is involved in protein-protein interactions and is structurally conserved across the HERC family, maintaining a β-propeller structure despite low sequence homology (Paparisto2018EvolutionGuided).

HERC3 is a small HERC protein, with a molecular weight of approximately 117 kDa, and contains a single RLD at the N-terminus and a HECT domain at the C-terminus (Hochrainer2005The; SánchezTena2016Functional). The protein is ubiquitously expressed, with high levels in the brain, and is primarily localized in the cytosol and vesicular structures, indicating a role in intracellular trafficking (SánchezTena2016Functional). HERC3 undergoes ubiquitination and may be involved in post-translational modifications, influencing its activity and interactions (Cruz2001HERC3; SánchezTena2016Functional). The protein's structure and function are further diversified by splice variant isoforms (Kamada2023HERC3).

## Function
The HERC3 gene encodes a protein that is part of the HECT domain E3 ubiquitin ligase family, which plays a crucial role in tagging proteins for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This process is essential for regulating protein turnover and maintaining cellular homeostasis. HERC3 is primarily located in the cytosol and vesicle-like structures, where it co-localizes with markers of intracellular trafficking such as b-COP, ARF, and Rab5, but not with trans-Golgi or lysosomal proteins (Cruz2001HERC3; SánchezTena2016Functional).

HERC3 is involved in ubiquitin-mediated processes, including the regulation of its own degradation and potentially other cellular functions through its interaction with ubiquitin (Cruz2001HERC3). It possesses a functional HECT domain capable of binding ubiquitin and undergoes ubiquitination itself, leading to its degradation by the proteasome (Cruz2001HERC3). HERC3 also interacts with proteins linking integrin-associated proteins and the cytoskeleton, such as hPLIC-1 and hPLIC-2, which influence the degradation of proteasomal targets (SánchezTena2016Functional).

In healthy human cells, HERC3 acts as a negative regulator of NF-κB signaling, promoting the degradation of NF-κB RelA independently of its ubiquitin ligase activity (SánchezTena2016Functional).

## Clinical Significance
HERC3 has been implicated in various cancers due to its role as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase. In colorectal cancer (CRC), HERC3 is downregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and this decreased expression is associated with poor overall survival and disease-free survival. HERC3 inhibits migration, invasion, and metastasis of CRC by regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through the ubiquitination and degradation of EIF5A2, a protein known to induce EMT in CRC (Zhang2022HERC3). 

In breast cancer, HERC3 interacts with ERK2, facilitating its ubiquitination and degradation, which is crucial for apoptosis regulation. The compound Z734 has been shown to induce apoptosis in breast cancer cells by promoting the degradation of ERK2 and regulating the HERC3/p53 signaling pathway. This suggests a tumor suppressor role for HERC3 in breast cancer development (Xu2022A).

HERC3 is also involved in the degradation of misfolded cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) proteins, playing a role in a novel ER-associated degradation (ERAD) branch. This function is significant in the context of cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease caused by mutations in the CFTR gene (Kamada2023HERC3).

## Interactions
HERC3, a member of the HERC family of ubiquitin ligases, is involved in various protein interactions. It contains a HECT domain that facilitates its binding to ubiquitin, a process confirmed through pull-down experiments with GST-ubiquitin. This interaction is significant for HERC3's regulation and degradation, as it undergoes ubiquitination and is targeted for proteasome-mediated degradation (Cruz2001HERC3).

HERC3 interacts with proteins involved in intracellular trafficking, such as Rab5, a GTPase associated with vesicular traffic, indicating its role in vesicular trafficking processes (Cruz2001HERC3). It also binds to human proteins hPLIC-1 and hPLIC-2, which are linked to integrin-associated proteins and the cytoskeleton. These interactions influence the degradation of proteasomal targets, including p53 and IjBa (SánchezTena2016Functional).

In the context of endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD), HERC3 acts as an auxiliary E3 ligase, collaborating with RNF5/185 to facilitate the degradation of misfolded CFTR proteins. It promotes the polyubiquitination of CFTR and recruits UBQLN2, enhancing the retrotranslocation and degradation of misfolded proteins (Kamada2023HERC3).
