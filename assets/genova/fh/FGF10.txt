# FGF10

## Overview
Fibroblast Growth Factor 10 (FGF10) is a gene that encodes the protein fibroblast growth factor 10, a member of the fibroblast growth factor family, which is known for its role in embryonic development, cell growth, morphogenesis, tissue repair, and tumor growth. The FGF10 protein is categorized as a paracrine signaling molecule, primarily interacting with fibroblast growth factor receptors FGFR1b and FGFR2b to mediate its biological effects. It is crucial for the development of various organs, including the lungs, limbs, and salivary glands, by promoting cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and migration (Wu2018Role; Watson2018Regulation). Mutations in the FGF10 gene have been associated with several developmental disorders, including Aplasia of Lacrimal and Salivary Glands (ALSG) and Lacrimo-Auriculo-Dento-Digital (LADD) syndrome, as well as certain cancers (Watson2018Regulation; Entesarian2007FGF10).

## Structure
The molecular structure of FGF10 is characterized by a β-trefoil fold consisting of 12 β-strands, similar to that of FGF7, with a root mean square deviation of 0.885 Å when superimposed (Yeh2003Structural). The β1 strand in FGF10 is longer than in FGF1 and FGF2, and the β10/β11 strand pair is defined by a single hydrogen bond, a hallmark of the FGF7 subfamily (Yeh2003Structural). The N terminus of receptor-bound FGF10 is more ordered compared to FGF1 and FGF2, forming a short helix (gN) that connects to β1 via a short loop (Yeh2003Structural).

FGF10 is a paracrine protein composed of a secretory signal peptide in the amino-terminal domain and a mature peptide in the carboxyl terminal (Zhou2020Mutations). It has a typical signal sequence for secretion and is part of the FGF7 subfamily, sharing sequence similarities and biochemical functions with other members (Watson2018Regulation). FGF10 binds to FGF receptors, particularly FGFR1b and FGFR2b, forming a 1:1 complex with FGFR2b (Yeh2003Structural). The interaction involves specific contacts at the FGF10-D3 interface, primarily through direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonds (Yeh2003Structural).

## Function
Fibroblast Growth Factor 10 (FGF10) is a critical protein involved in various developmental processes and cellular functions in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in organ development and morphogenesis by promoting cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. FGF10 is essential for the development of multiple organs, including the lungs, limbs, kidneys, salivary glands, and adipose tissue (Wu2018Role; Watson2018Regulation).

FGF10 functions primarily through paracrine signaling, interacting with the FGFR2b receptor on epithelial cells. This interaction is crucial for epithelial morphogenesis and branching during organ development, such as in the lungs and salivary glands (Chao2016Alveologenesis:; Clayton2018Emerging). In the lungs, FGF10 maintains the undifferentiated status of progenitor cells and is involved in the formation of alveolar structures (Chao2016Alveologenesis:).

In adipose tissue, FGF10 is secreted by preadipocytes and is vital for their differentiation into mature adipocytes, influencing the expression of transcription factors like C/EBPβ (Sakaue2002Requirement). FGF10 also plays a role in the regulation of transcription factors such as C/EBP, PPAR, and c-MYC, which are involved in processes like adipogenesis and epithelial cell regulation (Watson2018Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FGF10 gene are linked to several developmental disorders and diseases. Aplasia of Lacrimal and Salivary Glands (ALSG) and Lacrimo-Auriculo-Dento-Digital (LADD) syndrome are associated with mutations in FGF10, leading to underdevelopment or absence of lacrimal and salivary glands, resulting in symptoms like dry mouth and irritable eyes (Entesarian2007FGF10; Seymen2016Novel). The R193X mutation in FGF10 is also linked to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) (Watson2018Regulation).

FGF10 mutations are implicated in congenital heart defects, such as conotruncal defects, where a deletion variant affects the secretion capacity of the protein, impacting heart development (Zhou2020Mutations). In the gastrointestinal tract, FGF10 mutations can cause duodenal atresia and cecal atresia, characterized by the absence of a lumen and epithelial layer, due to disrupted signaling pathways (Fairbanks2004A; Teague2018FGF10).

In cancer, single nucleotide polymorphisms and point mutations in FGF10 can lead to oncogenic expression, particularly in pancreatic, gastric, and breast cancers (Watson2018Regulation). FGF10 is also involved in the growth of endometrial carcinoma cells and ameloblastoma through the ERK1/2 pathway (Watson2018Regulation).

## Interactions
Fibroblast Growth Factor 10 (FGF10) interacts with fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), specifically FGFR1b and FGFR2b, to initiate signaling pathways crucial for various cellular processes. Upon binding to these receptors, FGF10 induces receptor dimerization and trans-autophosphorylation of intracellular tyrosine residues, which is essential for receptor activation and the recruitment of adaptor proteins such as FRS2. FRS2, once phosphorylated, recruits other proteins like SHP2 and GRB2, which are vital for activating the ERK1/2 pathway (Watson2018Regulation).

FGF10 also interacts with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) in the extracellular matrix, which modulate its signaling by affecting its binding and activity. These interactions are particularly significant in lung morphogenesis, where specific sulfation patterns of HSPGs influence FGF10's ability to bind to FGFR2b and mediate efficient signal transduction (Izvolsky2003Heparan).

Additionally, FGF10 can recruit the negative regulator Sprouty2 to FRS2, modulating signaling pathways such as those involved in lung branching. Sprouty2 undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation upon FGF10 stimulation and differentially binds to proteins like Grb2 and Raf, inhibiting MAP kinase activation (Tefft2002mSprouty2). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms through which FGF10 influences cellular responses.
