which form ligand-gated ion channels with a central pore that forms a cation channel. Neuronal nAChRs are pentameric structures that can be either homomeric or heteromeric, with heteromeric structures containing both alpha and beta subunits. Each subunit contains an extracellular amino terminus and four transmembrane domains. Nicotine is one of the agonists that binds to the receptor. Variants in this gene have been associated with nicotine dependence and lung cancer. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.
