# PUS7L

## Overview
PUS7L is a gene that encodes the protein pseudouridine synthase 7-like, which is involved in the post-transcriptional modification of RNA molecules. This protein is categorized as an enzyme, specifically a pseudouridine synthase, which catalyzes the isomerization of uridine to pseudouridine in RNA. Pseudouridine is known to contribute to the stability and function of various RNA molecules, including tRNA, rRNA, and snRNA, by enhancing their structural integrity and functional capacity. The activity of PUS7L is crucial for maintaining proper cellular RNA processing and function, and its dysregulation may be implicated in various pathological conditions (Qiu2020aarFDC).
