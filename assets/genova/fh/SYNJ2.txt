# SYNJ2

## Overview
SYNJ2 is a gene that encodes the protein synaptojanin 2, a phosphoinositide phosphatase involved in critical cellular processes such as clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This protein plays a pivotal role in membrane vesicle trafficking, which is essential for maintaining cellular functions like signal transduction and communication. Synaptojanin 2 is particularly important in the dephosphorylation of phosphoinositides, influencing cell membrane dynamics and processes such as exo- and endocytosis, ion channel modulation, and cell signaling regulation (Zhang2021Identifying; Martelletti2020Synaptojanin2). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane, impacting cellular activities like migration and synaptic vesicle recycling, which are crucial for neuronal function and development (Martelletti2020Synaptojanin2). Dysregulation of SYNJ2 has been linked to various pathological conditions, including progressive hearing loss and certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Manji2011A; Zhang2021Identifying).

## Structure


## Function
Synaptojanin 2 (SYNJ2) is a phosphoinositide phosphatase that plays a critical role in various cellular processes, primarily through its involvement in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This process is essential for membrane vesicle trafficking, which is crucial for maintaining normal cellular activities such as signal transduction and cellular communication (Zhang2021Identifying). SYNJ2 is involved in the dephosphorylation of phosphoinositides, specifically converting PIP3 to PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PIP2 to PtdIns(4)P, which are important for cell membrane functions, including exo- and endocytosis, ion channel modulation, and cell signaling regulation (Martelletti2020Synaptojanin2).

In healthy human cells, SYNJ2 is active in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane, where it influences cellular processes like cell migration and synaptic vesicle recycling, impacting neuronal function and development (Martelletti2020Synaptojanin2). The protein's activity is crucial for the regulation of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which is necessary for the formation of invadopodia and astrocytic lamellipodia, structures involved in cellular movement and interaction with the extracellular environment (Zhang2021Identifying). These functions underscore SYNJ2's importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in pathological conditions when dysregulated.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the SYNJ2 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly progressive hearing loss and various cancers. In the context of hearing loss, a specific mutation in the SYNJ2 gene, known as p.Asn538Lys, has been identified as a cause of progressive, non-syndromic hearing loss in mice. This mutation leads to a loss of lipid phosphatase activity, resulting in hair cell degeneration and stereocilia fusion in the cochlea, which are critical for auditory function (Manji2011A). The mutation causes a progressive increase in auditory thresholds, with severe deafness developing by 12 weeks of age in affected mice (Manji2011A).

In cancer, SYNJ2 expression is notably upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). High levels of SYNJ2 are associated with poorer survival outcomes in HCC patients, and genetic alterations in SYNJ2, such as missense mutations and amplifications, are linked to worse prognosis (Zhang2021Identifying). In LUSC, SYNJ2 is involved in key signaling pathways and is associated with immune cell infiltration and tumor mutation burden, indicating its role in cancer progression and as a potential biomarker for prognosis (Hou2022SYNJ2).

## Interactions
SYNJ2 (synaptojanin 2) is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. It interacts with inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase B (INPP5B), with a significant combined score in protein-protein interaction analyses, indicating a strong interaction (Zhang2021Identifying). SYNJ2 also acts as an effector molecule for Rac family small GTPase 1 (RAC1), potentially regulating RAC1-mediated endocytosis inhibitory effects and arresting cell growth (Zhang2021Identifying). This interaction is significant in the context of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), where SYNJ2 inhibits the process by interacting with ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1, affecting the formation of endocytic vesicles (Zhang2021Identifying).

In lung adenocarcinoma, SYNJ2 is known to interact with the Rho family GTPase Rac1, which is associated with the formation of lamellipodia and invadopodia, structures crucial for tumor cell migration and invasion (Lu2020The). These interactions highlight SYNJ2's role in modulating cellular signaling and structural dynamics, particularly in cancer progression. However, specific details on the physical interactions of SYNJ2 with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond these associations are not extensively detailed in the available literature.
