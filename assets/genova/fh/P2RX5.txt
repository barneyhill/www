# P2RX5

## Overview
The P2RX5 gene encodes the purinergic receptor P2X5, a member of the ATP-gated ion channel family, which plays a significant role in cellular signaling and communication. This receptor is characterized by its ability to form ligand-gated ion channels that are activated by extracellular ATP, allowing the passage of ions such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and chloride across the cell membrane. The P2X5 receptor is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, brain, spinal cord, adrenal gland, and immune cells, indicating its involvement in diverse physiological processes such as muscle differentiation and immune responses (Bo2003Pharmacological; King2022Rehabilitation). The receptor's unique chloride permeability distinguishes it from other P2X receptors, which are typically cation-selective, and suggests a specialized role in skeletal muscle function (Bo2003Pharmacological). Additionally, P2X5 interacts with other proteins, such as methylosome protein 50, and participates in inflammasome activation, highlighting its importance in both cellular signaling and immune function (Jeong2020Mice; Kim2019Methylosome).

## Structure
The P2RX5 gene encodes the P2X5 receptor, a member of the ATP-gated ion channel family. The primary structure of the P2X5 receptor includes a sequence of 444 amino acids in its full-length form, although a common truncated isoform exists due to exon 10 skipping, resulting in a 422 amino acid subunit (King2022Rehabilitation). The receptor features two transmembrane regions, TM1 and TM2, which are crucial for its ion channel function (King2022Rehabilitation). The secondary structure likely includes these transmembrane helices, which are typical of ion channels.

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices to form the ion pore, with the TM2 region playing a key role in ion permeation (King2022Rehabilitation). The quaternary structure of the P2X5 receptor can form homomeric assemblies, although it may also participate in heteromeric complexes with other P2X subunits (King2022Rehabilitation).

The receptor's ATP-binding site is located in the ectodomain, which is essential for its activation by ATP (King2022Rehabilitation). The P2X5 receptor is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function (King2022Rehabilitation). The receptor's structure and function are also affected by splice variants, with the full-length and truncated forms exhibiting different functional properties (King2022Rehabilitation).

## Function
The P2RX5 gene encodes the purinergic receptor P2X5, a ligand-gated ion channel activated by ATP. This receptor is involved in various molecular processes, including ion channel function and intercellular communication. The P2X5 receptor is permeable to sodium, potassium, calcium, and chloride ions, which influences cell signaling and function (King2022Rehabilitation). It is expressed in several tissues, including the heart, brain, spinal cord, adrenal gland, and immune cells, suggesting a role in diverse physiological processes (Bo2003Pharmacological).

In healthy human cells, the P2X5 receptor is implicated in muscle differentiation, particularly in the conversion of satellite cells into mature muscle fibers (Bo2003Pharmacological). It is also expressed in the immune system, notably in peripheral blood T cells, B cells, NK cells, and lymphoid tissues, indicating a potential role in immune responses (King2022Rehabilitation). The receptor's chloride permeability is of particular interest, as it is unusual for P2X receptors, which are typically cation-selective. This characteristic may be relevant in skeletal muscle function, where ATP-activated currents have been associated with chloride permeability (Bo2003Pharmacological).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the P2RX5 gene, which encodes the purinergic receptor P2X5, have been implicated in various clinical conditions. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the human P2RX5 gene results in a truncated P2X5 protein, affecting its ATP-binding and transmembrane domains. This SNP is prevalent in the population, but its impact on human physiology remains unclear (Kim2017The). The P2X5 receptor is expressed in the immune system, particularly in T cells, B cells, NK cells, and lymphoid tissues, suggesting a potential role in immune responses. This expression pattern indicates that alterations in P2X5 function could influence immune-related conditions, such as promoting the graft-versus-leukemia reaction following stem cell implantation (King2022Rehabilitation).

In rats, mutations in the P2X5 receptor, such as S191F and F195H, have been shown to enhance its functionality, raising questions about the evolutionary role of these mutations and their potential to enhance receptor function in other species (Sun2019Altered). These mutations alter the receptor's response to ATP, which could have implications for understanding the physiological and potentially clinical significance of similar mutations in human P2X5 receptors (Sun2019Altered).

## Interactions
The P2RX5 gene encodes the purinergic receptor P2X5, which is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function. One significant interaction is with methylosome protein 50 (MEP50), a cofactor of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5). This interaction is crucial for osteoclast maturation, as MEP50 associates with the C-terminal region of P2X5. The association between P2X5 and MEP50 suggests a novel signaling mechanism that may involve cross-talk between purinergic signaling and PRMT5 methylosome activity (Kim2019Methylosome).

P2X5 also participates in inflammasome activation, which is essential for the production of cytokines like IL-1β and IL-18. This process is critical for immune responses, such as those against Listeria monocytogenes infection. P2X5-deficient macrophages show impaired inflammasome activation, indicating that P2X5 plays a role in this pathway independently of conventional ATP-triggered signaling (Jeong2020Mice).

Additionally, P2X5 can form homomeric receptors and potentially heteromeric receptors with other P2X subunits, such as P2X1-4 and P2X6, but not P2X7. These interactions can modify the operational profile of P2X receptors, influencing their functionality and pharmacological properties (King2022Rehabilitation).
