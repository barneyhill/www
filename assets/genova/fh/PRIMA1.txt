# PRIMA1

## Overview
PRIMA1 is a gene that encodes the proline-rich membrane anchor 1 protein, which plays a crucial role in anchoring acetylcholinesterase to the cell membrane, thereby influencing cholinergic signaling pathways. This protein is categorized as a membrane anchor protein, essential for maintaining the proper localization and function of acetylcholinesterase in neuronal and non-neuronal tissues. The gene's expression and regulation are of significant interest due to its involvement in various physiological and pathological processes, including its hypermethylation in certain cancers and psychiatric disorders, which suggests its potential as a biomarker for these conditions (Teschler2016Aberrant; Kalmár2015DNA; Barták2017Colorectal).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the PRIMA1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In colorectal cancer (CRC) and adenomas, PRIMA1 is frequently hypermethylated, leading to decreased mRNA expression. This hypermethylation is observed in a significant percentage of CRC and adenoma patients, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for early detection of these conditions (Kalmár2015DNA; Barták2017Colorectal). The gene's hypermethylation and reduced expression are also noted in prostate cancer and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Barták2017Colorectal).

In psychiatric disorders, PRIMA1 hypermethylation is associated with major depressive disorder (MDD) and borderline personality disorder (BPD). In MDD, increased methylation correlates with decreased gene expression, which may affect cholinergic transmission and contribute to the disorder's pathophysiology (Teschler2016Aberrant). Similarly, in BPD, PRIMA1 shows significantly higher methylation levels compared to controls, indicating a potential role in the disorder's development (Teschler2016Aberrant).

PRIMA1 is also linked to subclinical atherosclerosis, with specific genetic variants associated with carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and atherosclerotic events. These variants may influence vascular tone regulation through acetylcholinesterase activity, although the exact mechanisms remain unclear (Wang2019Targeted).
