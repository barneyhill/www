# CMTM6

## Overview
CMTM6, or CKLF like MARVEL transmembrane domain containing 6, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in critical cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of immune responses. The CMTM6 protein is characterized by its MARVEL domain, which is typical of proteins that participate in membrane apposition events, and it is classified as a transmembrane protein due to its structure comprising four transmembrane helices (Eichel2024Schwann; Zhang2023Crystal). Functionally, CMTM6 is pivotal in modulating the stability and expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), a protein that plays a significant role in immune checkpoint regulation by inhibiting T cell responses. This interaction is crucial for both normal immune function and the immune evasion mechanisms exploited by cancer cells (Mezzadra2017Identification). The clinical significance of CMTM6 is underscored by its varied expression across different cancer types, where it influences tumor progression, immune cell infiltration, and the efficacy of immunotherapies (Zhao2021Prognostic; Gao2023CMTM6).

## Structure
The CMTM6 protein is characterized by the presence of a MARVEL domain, which is common in proteins involved in membrane apposition events (Eichel2024Schwann). The protein structure includes four transmembrane helices, with both the amino and carboxy termini located in the cytosol. These helices are arranged in a counter-clockwise manner from TM1 to TM4 when viewed from the cytosolic side (Zhang2023Crystal). The experimentally determined structure of CMTM6 from bovine, which shares similarities with the human protein, includes residues 33-165 (Zhang2023Crystal).

CMTM6 is known to interact with PD-L1, stabilizing its expression on the cell surface by preventing lysosomal degradation (Zhang2023Crystal). This interaction is conserved across species, as demonstrated by a pull-down assay confirming the interaction between bovine CMTM6 and human PD-L1 (Zhang2023Crystal). While specific details about post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and splice variant isoforms are not provided in the context, these modifications are common in proteins of this family (Zhao2021Prognostic). The protein's role in immune response regulation is significant, particularly in the context of cancer, where it influences the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (Zhao2021Prognostic).

## Function
CMTM6 (CKLF like MARVEL transmembrane domain containing 6) is a protein that plays a significant role in regulating immune responses by modulating the stability and expression of the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) protein. CMTM6 is predominantly located in the plasma membrane and endosomes, where it interacts with PD-L1 to protect it from ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. This interaction enhances the stability and half-life of PD-L1, thereby maintaining its expression on the cell surface (Mezzadra2017Identification).

The stabilization of PD-L1 by CMTM6 is crucial for immune checkpoint regulation, as PD-L1 plays a key role in inhibiting T cell responses, which can be exploited by tumors to evade immune detection. CMTM6's function in this context suggests its involvement in immune evasion mechanisms, particularly in cancer cells (Mezzadra2017Identification). However, in healthy human cells, CMTM6's role in maintaining PD-L1 levels is essential for normal immune function, ensuring that immune responses are appropriately regulated to prevent autoimmunity and maintain immune homeostasis (Mezzadra2017Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CMTM6 gene have significant clinical implications across various cancer types. In cervical cancer, CMTM6 is overexpressed in cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma tissues, correlating with poorer prognosis and lower survival rates. This overexpression promotes cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and is linked to the MAPK signaling pathway, suggesting CMTM6 as a potential therapeutic target (Huang2022CMTM6).

In ovarian cancer, high CMTM6 expression is associated with improved prognosis, including longer overall survival and progression-free survival. This positive outcome is linked to CMTM6's involvement in immune response pathways, indicating its role in enhancing antitumor immunity (Yin2022Overexpressed).

In pancreatic adenocarcinoma, elevated CMTM6 expression is linked to poor survival outcomes and is associated with increased tumor proliferation, migration, and invasion. CMTM6 stabilizes PD-L1 expression, influencing the tumor immune microenvironment and potentially affecting responses to immunotherapy (Gao2023CMTM6).

CMTM6 also plays a role in stabilizing PD-L1 across various cancers, impacting immune evasion mechanisms. Its expression is correlated with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint-associated genes, suggesting its involvement in immune escape and modulation of immunotherapy efficacy (Zhao2021Prognostic).

## Interactions
CMTM6 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. One of the primary interactions of CMTM6 is with the PD-L1 protein. CMTM6 stabilizes PD-L1 by reducing its ubiquitination, thereby increasing its half-life and maintaining its expression on the cell surface. This interaction is crucial for the immune evasion capabilities of tumor cells, as PD-L1 can inhibit T cell activity (Mezzadra2017Identification).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, CMTM6 interacts with vimentin, a mesenchymal protein. This interaction stabilizes vimentin, promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which enhances the migration and invasion capabilities of cancer cells. The interaction between CMTM6 and vimentin has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and colocalization studies (Huang2021CMTM6).

CMTM6 also interacts with the HER2 protein in breast cancer cells, where it stabilizes HER2 by inhibiting its ubiquitination. This stabilization contributes to trastuzumab resistance and promotes the survival, migration, and invasion of breast cancer cells (Xing2023CMTM6). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of CMTM6 in cancer progression and immune modulation.
