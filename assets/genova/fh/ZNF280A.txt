# ZNF280A

## Overview
ZNF280A is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 280A, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by their zinc finger domains, which facilitate binding to DNA, RNA, or other proteins, thereby influencing various cellular processes. Zinc finger protein 280A is involved in the regulation of gene expression and has been implicated in several types of cancer, including colorectal and ovarian cancer, as well as in neuropsychiatric disorders. The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as RPS14 and EIF3C, suggest its role in critical signaling pathways like the PI3K-Akt pathway, which are essential for cell proliferation and survival (Liu2020ZNF280A; Tian2022Downregulation). Additionally, alterations in ZNF280A expression have been linked to disease progression and prognosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Wang2019ZNF280A; Zhu2020Knockdown).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZNF280A has been implicated in several diseases, primarily due to alterations in its expression levels. In colorectal cancer (CRC), ZNF280A is significantly upregulated, correlating with advanced tumor stages, poor prognosis, and disease progression. Silencing ZNF280A in CRC cells reduces proliferation and induces cell cycle arrest, suggesting its role in promoting tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, ZNF280A inactivates the Hippo signaling pathway, which is crucial for controlling cell growth and apoptosis (Wang2019ZNF280A; Tian2022Downregulation).

In ovarian cancer, ZNF280A is also highly expressed and associated with clinical staging and metastasis. Knockdown of ZNF280A reduces cell proliferation and migration, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhu2020Knockdown).

ZNF280A is involved in neuropsychiatric disorders through copy number variations at the 22q11.22 locus, a known risk factor for conditions like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Deletions in this region, including ZNF280A, have been observed in ADHD and ASD cohorts (Glessner2017Copy).

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), ZNF280A is frequently deleted, leading to significantly lower expression levels. This deletion is associated with the expression of lambda surface light chains, suggesting a role in CLL pathogenesis (Gunn2009Array; Mraz2013The).

## Interactions
ZNF280A, a zinc finger protein, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In colorectal cancer (CRC), ZNF280A interacts with RPS14, a downstream target, regulating its expression and stability. The knockdown of ZNF280A promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of RPS14, potentially through interaction with the E3 ubiquitin ligase SYVN1, as supported by co-immunoprecipitation assays (Tian2022Downregulation). This interaction affects the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, which is crucial for CRC development (Tian2022Downregulation).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), ZNF280A interacts with EIF3C, a core subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor 3 complex. This interaction is demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation in NCI-H1299 cells, suggesting that ZNF280A may regulate LUAD development through EIF3C (Liu2020ZNF280A). The overexpression of ZNF280A enhances cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration, while its knockdown inhibits these processes and promotes apoptosis (Liu2020ZNF280A).

ZNF280A also interacts with IκBα, as identified using CF-PPiD technology. This interaction was confirmed through a pull-down assay with streptavidin beads, indicating that ZNF280A interacts with IκBα, although it was not immunoprecipitated with AirID-IκBα (Sugiyama2022CFPPiD).
