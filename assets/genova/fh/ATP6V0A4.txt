# ATP6V0A4

## Overview
The ATP6V0A4 gene encodes the a4 subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) complex, a critical component in the regulation of intracellular pH through proton translocation across cellular membranes. The protein product, ATPase H+ transporting V0 subunit a4, is a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in acidifying intracellular compartments, which is essential for various cellular processes such as protein sorting and neurotransmitter release (Esmail2018Molecular). The a4 subunit is particularly significant in the kidney, where it is involved in maintaining acid-base balance by facilitating proton secretion in intercalated cells (Schulz2007Differential). Mutations in ATP6V0A4 are linked to autosomal recessive distal renal tubular acidosis and can also result in sensorineural hearing loss, underscoring the gene's importance in both renal and auditory functions (Miura2013Mutational; VargasPoussou2006Genetic).

## Structure
The ATP6V0A4 gene encodes the a4 subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) complex, which is crucial for proton translocation across membranes. The a4 subunit is the largest within the V-ATPase complex and is composed of a hydrophilic N-terminal domain and a membrane-integrated C-terminal domain. The C-terminal domain contains eight transmembrane α-helices, which are essential for its function in proton translocation (Schep2016Models; Esmail2018Molecular).

The N-terminal domain associates with the V1 sector of the V-ATPase, while the C-terminal domain forms an interface with the V0 rotor c-ring, facilitating proton movement (Esmail2018Molecular). The structure of the a4 subunit is modeled based on the yeast Vph1p structure, indicating conserved residues crucial for its function (Esmail2018Molecular).

Mutations in ATP6V0A4, such as R449H and G820R, affect the protein's stability and function. The R449H mutation leads to protein retention in the endoplasmic reticulum and degradation via the proteasomal pathway, while the G820R mutation interferes with proton translocation by forming a salt bridge that may block the proton channel (Esmail2018Molecular). These mutations highlight the importance of the structural integrity of the a4 subunit for its proper function.

## Function
The ATP6V0A4 gene encodes the a4 isoform of the a subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) complex, which is a multisubunit rotary proton pump essential for regulating the pH of cells and their intracellular compartments (Esmail2018Molecular). This complex is involved in acidifying various intracellular compartments, a process crucial for protein sorting, zymogen activation, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and neurotransmitter release (Esmail2018Molecular). In mammals, the a4 isoform is specifically targeted to the plasma membranes of specialized cells, such as kidney intercalated cells, where it plays a critical role in secreting protons into the extracellular fluid, thus maintaining acid-base balance in the body (Esmail2018Molecular).

In the kidney, the a4 subunit is expressed in the brush border membrane of the proximal tubule, the thick ascending limb, and all types of intercalated cells along the collecting duct (Schulz2007Differential). This localization suggests its involvement in proton transport and pH regulation in different segments of the nephron, particularly in intercalated cells, which are crucial for acid-base balance (Schulz2007Differential). The a4 isoform is the most abundant in the kidney, indicating its significant role in this organ (Schulz2007Differential).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATP6V0A4 gene are associated with autosomal recessive distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA), a condition characterized by the kidney's inability to acidify urine, leading to metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, and nephrolithiasis (Miura2013Mutational; Zhang2021Identification; Escobar2016Mutations). This gene encodes the a4 subunit of the V-ATPase, which is crucial for proton secretion in the kidney's acid-secretory intercalated cells (Escobar2016Mutations).

Mutations in ATP6V0A4 can also lead to sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), with variability in onset and severity. Some individuals with these mutations experience early-onset severe SNHL, while others develop hearing impairment later in life (Stover2002Novel; VargasPoussou2006Genetic). The gene is expressed in the epithelial cells of the cochlea, which may explain its role in hearing (Stover2002Novel).

The genetic heterogeneity of dRTA is highlighted by the presence of various mutation types in ATP6V0A4, including missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice site mutations, some of which show geographical founder effects (Escobar2016Mutations; Stover2002Novel). These mutations disrupt the normal function of the V-ATPase, impairing acid-base balance in the kidney and potentially affecting hearing (Zhang2021Identification).

## Interactions
ATP6V0A4, a subunit of the V-ATPase complex, participates in several protein interactions crucial for its function. It interacts with the V-ATPase assembly chaperone VMA21 and the V1 sector subunit ATP6V1B1. The a4 R449H mutation in ATP6V0A4 shows increased association with VMA21 and reduced association with ATP6V1B1, affecting the assembly and function of the V-ATPase complex (Esmail2018Molecular). This mutation also results in defective cell surface expression and retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (Esmail2018Molecular).

The a4 G820R mutation is located within the proton translocation pathway and may disrupt proton translocation by forming a salt bridge with an adjacent residue, E729, potentially blocking the proton channel (Esmail2018Molecular). This mutation also affects the interaction with phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1), inhibiting this interaction and impacting V-ATPase function (Esmail2018Molecular).

ATP6V0A4 interacts with the B1 subunit of V-ATPase, showing isoform-specific binding preferences (Merkulova2015Mapping). These interactions are essential for the stability, trafficking, and assembly of the V-ATPase complex, highlighting the importance of specific residues in ATP6V0A4 for its proper function.
