# TCERG1L

## Overview
TCERG1L is a gene that encodes the protein transcription elongation regulator 1-like, which is involved in the regulation of transcription elongation by influencing RNA polymerase II activity. This protein is categorized as a nuclear protein due to its active role within the cell nucleus, where it modulates gene expression critical for various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and stress response (Meijer2021TCERG1L). TCERG1L is expressed in a variety of tissues, such as the brain, gut, thyroid, and cochlear hair cells, suggesting its involvement in diverse biological functions (Meijer2021TCERG1L). The gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions, including cisplatin-induced hearing loss, inflammatory bowel disease, and colorectal cancer, highlighting its potential significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Akanyibah2024Effects; Meijer2021TCERG1L; Yi2021DNA).

## Function
The TCERG1L gene encodes a protein involved in the regulation of transcription elongation, primarily influencing RNA polymerase II activity during the transcription process. This protein is active in the nucleus and plays a significant role in modulating gene expression, which is crucial for various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and response to stress (Meijer2021TCERG1L). TCERG1L is expressed in multiple tissues, such as the brain, gut, thyroid, and cochlear hair cells, indicating its involvement in diverse biological functions (Meijer2021TCERG1L).

In the context of cellular defense mechanisms, TCERG1L has been shown to protect cells from cisplatin toxicity, a chemotherapy drug, by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and enhancing cell viability. This suggests its role in cellular responses to stress or damage (Meijer2021TCERG1L). The gene's expression is subject to epigenetic regulation, which may further influence its function, as seen in its hypomethylation status associated with altered expression levels in male infertility cases (Sujit2018Genomewide). Despite its involvement in these processes, the specific function of TCERG1L in healthy human cells remains less documented, with most studies focusing on its role in disease contexts.

## Clinical Significance
The TCERG1L gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions, primarily through its association with cisplatin-induced hearing loss in children undergoing cancer treatment. A genome-wide association study identified a genetic variant in TCERG1L linked to a 3.11-fold increased risk of hearing loss in these patients. This association was confirmed in two independent cohorts, highlighting the gene's role in influencing susceptibility to this specific type of hearing loss (Meijer2021TCERG1L).

In addition to its role in hearing loss, TCERG1L has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC). The gene is frequently hypermethylated in ulcerative colitis and more prominently in colorectal cancer, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for disease progression from IBD to cancer (Akanyibah2024Effects; Yi2021DNA). Hypermethylation of TCERG1L has also been observed in Crohn's disease, indicating its involvement in the pathogenesis of this condition (Akanyibah2024Effects; Yi2021DNA).

While TCERG1L has been studied in the context of otitis media, its role in this condition is not strongly supported, as the gene does not appear to be a significant candidate for otitis media susceptibility (Rye2014Genetic).
