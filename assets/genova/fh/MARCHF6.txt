# MARCHF6

## Overview
MARCHF6 is a gene that encodes the membrane-associated ring-CH-type finger 6 protein, which functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is integral to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, characterized by its 14 transmembrane domains and a catalytic N-terminal RING domain, which is crucial for its ubiquitination activity (Botsch2024Doa10/MARCH6; Scott2021The). MARCHF6 plays a pivotal role in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, where it targets proteins for proteasomal degradation, thereby maintaining cellular protein homeostasis (Botsch2024Doa10/MARCH6; Scott2021The). It is particularly significant in cholesterol metabolism, regulating key enzymes such as squalene monooxygenase and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase (Scott2021The). Mutations and alterations in the MARCHF6 gene have been linked to various clinical conditions, including neurodevelopmental disorders and metabolic diseases, underscoring its importance in human health (Scott2021The; Fenton2024SC5D).

## Structure
The MARCHF6 protein is a polytopic protein embedded in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, characterized by its 14 transmembrane domains, which contribute to its hydrophobic nature (Gawden‐Bone2023As; Scott2021The). It consists of 910 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 103 kDa (Scott2021The). The protein includes a catalytic N-terminal RING domain, essential for its ubiquitination activity, and a C-terminal element (CTE) that regulates its auto-degradation (Botsch2024Doa10/MARCH6; Scott2021The). 

MARCHF6 also contains a lipid-binding scaffold domain and a flexible helical bundle, forming a unique circular structure within the membrane (Botsch2024Doa10/MARCH6). The RING domain is positioned above a central membrane channel, which is crucial for its E3 ligase activity (Botsch2024Doa10/MARCH6). The protein's structure is further supported by a scaffold domain that interacts with phospholipids and a transmembrane helix fitting into a groove on the scaffold's backside (Botsch2024Doa10/MARCH6). 

Mutations in the RING domain and other regions can impair the protein's function, particularly in the degradation of substrates like squalene monooxygenase (SQLE) (Botsch2024Doa10/MARCH6). The protein is also subject to post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination, which is central to its function as an E3 ligase (Scott2021The).

## Function
MARCHF6 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a significant role in protein regulation within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of human cells. It is involved in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, where it tags proteins with ubiquitin for proteasomal degradation, thus maintaining protein homeostasis (Botsch2024Doa10/MARCH6; Scott2021The). MARCHF6 is particularly important in cholesterol metabolism, targeting key enzymes in the cholesterol synthesis pathway, such as squalene monooxygenase (SQLE) and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), for degradation (Botsch2024Doa10/MARCH6; Scott2021The). 

The protein is characterized by a polytopic structure with 14 transmembrane domains, including a RING domain essential for its ubiquitination activity (Scott2021The). MARCHF6's activity is modulated by sterols, which stabilize the protein and prevent its degradation, thereby influencing cholesterol synthesis (Scott2021The). It also plays a role in the degradation of other proteins involved in metabolic processes, such as DIO2 and RGS2, through pathways like the Ac/N-end rule pathway (Scott2021The). 

Overall, MARCHF6 acts as a metabolic integrator, influencing various cellular processes through its regulation of protein degradation, thereby contributing to cellular homeostasis and metabolic regulation (Botsch2024Doa10/MARCH6; Scott2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MARCHF6 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in neurodevelopmental disorders and metabolic conditions. Large chromosomal deletions that include the MARCHF6 gene are associated with Cri-du-chat syndrome, characterized by mental retardation and developmental delays (Scott2021The; Fenton2024SC5D). Repeat expansions in the first intron of MARCHF6 are linked to familial adult myoclonic epilepsy, suggesting a role in brain function (Scott2021The; Smith2020MRNA). A single nucleotide polymorphism within a MARCHF6 intron is associated with an increased risk of obesity, indicating its involvement in metabolic regulation (Scott2021The; Fenton2024SC5D).

MARCHF6 also plays a role in cholesterol metabolism, and its dysregulation can exacerbate conditions like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (Fenton2024SC5D). In cancer, MARCHF6 is implicated in promoting tumor growth by targeting proteins like DHX9 for degradation, affecting cholesterol uptake and metabolism (Fenton2024SC5D). The gene's product, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is involved in the regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis enzymes, and mutations in its C-terminal element can lead to dysregulation of protein levels, potentially contributing to disease (Fenton2024SC5D).

## Interactions
MARCHF6, a membrane-associated E3 ubiquitin ligase, engages in several critical interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in protein ubiquitination and degradation pathways. It interacts with E2 conjugating enzymes such as Ube2G2 and Ube2J2, which are essential for its autoubiquitination and the ubiquitination of non-canonical residues (Scott2021The). MARCHF6 also interacts with Ube2W, potentially participating in the N-end rule pathway (Scott2021The).

MARCHF6 is involved in the degradation of key enzymes in the cholesterol synthesis pathway, including HMGCR, squalene monooxygenase (SM), lanosterol 14α-demethylase (LDM), and 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR24) (Scott2021The). It also targets mutant versions of the bile salt export pump (BSEP) and NPC intracellular cholesterol transporter 1 (NPC1), as part of a quality control process in the endoplasmic reticulum (Scott2021The).

The interaction between MARCHF6 and SQLE (squalene epoxidase) is facilitated by a transmembrane channel, with specific mutations in MARCHF6 affecting this interaction and SQLE degradation (Botsch2024Doa10/MARCH6). MARCHF6's RING domain is crucial for stimulating ubiquitin discharge from the UBE2J2 catalytic domain, highlighting its role in ubiquitylation processes (Botsch2024Doa10/MARCH6).
