# ISCU

## Overview
The ISCU gene encodes a scaffold protein known as the iron-sulfur cluster assembly enzyme, which plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters. These clusters are essential cofactors involved in various cellular processes, including electron transport, enzyme catalysis, and gene expression regulation. The ISCU protein is primarily active in the mitochondria, where it facilitates the assembly and transfer of Fe-S clusters to recipient proteins, thereby influencing cellular energy metabolism and maintaining iron homeostasis. Structurally, ISCU exhibits dynamic conformational states that are crucial for its function, interacting with several proteins to form a core complex responsible for Fe-S cluster assembly. Mutations in the ISCU gene are linked to myopathies characterized by muscle weakness and exercise intolerance, underscoring its clinical significance (Rouault2012Biogenesis; Funauchi2015Regulation; Kollberg2009Clinical).

## Structure
The ISCU protein, involved in iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis, exhibits a dynamic structure with two conformational states: a structured state (S-state) and a partially disordered state (D-state) (Markley2013Metamorphic). The primary structure of ISCU includes invariant cysteine residues crucial for its function, such as Cys36, Cys63, and Cys107, along with a histidine residue, His106, which are involved in cluster coordination (Shimomura2008The). 

The secondary structure of ISCU consists of α-helices and β-strands, with the S-state retaining most of this structure, including two N-terminal β-strands and a C-terminal α-helix (Markley2013Metamorphic). The tertiary structure forms a compact, globular shape, facilitating interactions with other proteins (Kim2012ThreeDimensional). 

In terms of quaternary structure, ISCU from Aquifex aeolicus forms an asymmetric trimeric structure when bound to a [2Fe-2S] cluster, which is distinct from the monomeric forms observed in other species (Shimomura2008The). This trimeric form is held together by polar and non-polar interactions, with significant surface area buried at the interfaces (Shimomura2008The). 

ISCU is also known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can regulate its activity (Cai2013Human). The protein's ability to adopt different conformations is crucial for its role in iron-sulfur cluster assembly and delivery (Markley2013Metamorphic).

## Function
The ISCU gene encodes a scaffold protein that is crucial for the biogenesis of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters, which are essential cofactors in various cellular processes, including electron transport, enzyme catalysis, and regulation of gene expression. In healthy human cells, ISCU is primarily active in the mitochondria, where it facilitates the formation and transfer of Fe-S clusters to recipient proteins, impacting cellular energy metabolism and overall organismal health (Rouault2012Biogenesis).

ISCU forms part of a core complex with NFS1, ISD11, and frataxin, which is responsible for the initial assembly of Fe-S clusters. It binds to NFS1, which donates inorganic sulfur, while cysteines from ISCU provide sulfur ligands that directly bind iron in the nascent Fe-S cluster. This process is ATP-dependent and involves a chaperone-co-chaperone system to transfer the Fe-S cluster to target proteins, protecting the clusters from oxidative stress during biogenesis and transfer (Rouault2012Biogenesis).

The ISCU protein is also involved in the regulation of iron homeostasis through the p53-ISCU pathway. Following DNA damage, p53 induces ISCU expression, which facilitates Fe-S cluster formation, impacting the translation of iron storage and uptake proteins, thus maintaining iron balance in cells (Funauchi2015Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ISCU gene are associated with several myopathies, primarily characterized by muscle weakness and exercise intolerance. One such condition is iron-sulfur cluster deficiency myopathy, which is linked to a homozygous intronic mutation (IVS5 + 382 G4C) that causes aberrant splicing of the ISCU mRNA. This mutation leads to the insertion of pseudoexons, resulting in a deficiency of the IscU protein, particularly in skeletal muscle, and is associated with symptoms like muscle weakness and impaired mitochondrial function (Stehling2014Mitochondrial; Kollberg2009Clinical).

Hereditary myopathy with lactic acidosis (HML) is another condition caused by a single base transition in intron 5 of the ISCU gene. This mutation results in the retention of an additional exon, leading to a truncated ISCU protein and reduced activity of the ISC assembly system, particularly affecting striated muscle (Stehling2014Mitochondrial; Rawcliffe2016The).

A novel de novo dominant mutation, c.287G>T, in the ISCU gene has been identified, causing mitochondrial myopathy. This mutation leads to the amino acid substitution p.G96V, affecting a highly conserved residue and resulting in muscle weakness and partial depletion of mitochondrial enzyme activities (Legati2017A).

## Interactions
The ISCU protein, a scaffold protein involved in iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biosynthesis, interacts with several proteins crucial for its function. It exists in two conformational states: a structured S-state and a partially disordered D-state. The human mitochondrial chaperone mtHSP70 and cysteine desulfurase NFS1 preferentially bind to the D-state of ISCU, shifting the equilibrium towards this conformation (Cai2013Human). The co-chaperone HSC20, however, binds to the S-state, stabilizing it (Cai2013Human). 

The NFS1-ISD11 complex, involved in Fe-S cluster assembly, also binds to the D-state of ISCU, enhancing the efficiency of cluster formation (Cai2013Human). Zinc ions stabilize the S-state of ISCU and inhibit cluster formation, indicating a regulatory role in the conformational dynamics of ISCU (Cai2013Human). 

In Escherichia coli, the ISCU homolog, IscU, interacts with IscS, HscA, and HscB, which are involved in Fe-S cluster assembly and delivery. IscS binds to the D-state, while HscB targets the S-state, facilitating the transfer of Fe-S clusters to acceptor proteins (Markley2013Metamorphic; Kim2015Tangled). These interactions highlight the dynamic nature of ISCU's role in Fe-S cluster biosynthesis.
