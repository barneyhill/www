# ALOX12B

## Overview
ALOX12B is a gene that encodes the enzyme arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase, 12R type (12R-LOX), which is a member of the lipoxygenase family of enzymes. This enzyme is primarily involved in the oxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, playing a critical role in maintaining the epidermal barrier function by contributing to the formation of the cornified cell envelope and extracellular lipid layers in the skin's stratum corneum (Hotz2021MetaAnalysis; Jobard2002Lipoxygenase3). ALOX12B is predominantly expressed in keratinocytes, particularly in the suprabasal layers of the epidermis, where it is essential for the advanced stages of terminal differentiation and the establishment of the epidermal lipid barrier (Jobard2002Lipoxygenase3). Mutations in ALOX12B are linked to autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI), a group of skin disorders characterized by hyperkeratosis and scaling, and have also been associated with primary ovarian insufficiency in certain cases (Hotz2021MetaAnalysis; Alavi2020Mutation).

## Structure
The ALOX12B protein is a member of the lipoxygenase family, characterized by its nonheme, iron-containing dioxygenase activity. Its molecular structure includes two main domains: the PLAT (Polycystin-1, Lipoxygenase, α-Toxin) or LH2 (lipoxygenase homology) domain and the lipoxygenase domain. The PLAT/LH2 domain, spanning amino acids 2 to 119, forms a β-sandwich structure with two β-sheets and four β-strands, which facilitates interactions with lipids or membrane-bound proteins (Hotz2021MetaAnalysis). The lipoxygenase domain extends from amino acid 120 to 701, playing a crucial role in the enzyme's catalytic function (Hotz2021MetaAnalysis).

The primary structure of ALOX12B consists of a sequence of amino acids, while its secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets. The tertiary structure forms a three-dimensional conformation, essential for its enzymatic activity. Although specific details on the quaternary structure are not provided, the protein may interact with other proteins as part of its function. ALOX12B may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, and splice variants can lead to different isoforms, although specific details on these aspects are not extensively covered in the available literature.

## Function
The ALOX12B gene encodes the enzyme arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase, 12R type (12R-LOX), which is involved in the oxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, a crucial process for maintaining the epidermal barrier function. This enzyme plays a significant role in the formation of the cornified cell envelope and the extracellular lipid layers in the stratum corneum, essential for proper skin barrier function (Hotz2021MetaAnalysis). ALOX12B is primarily expressed in keratinocytes, particularly in the suprabasal layers of the epidermis, where it contributes to the advanced stages of terminal differentiation, such as establishing the epidermal lipid barrier (Jobard2002Lipoxygenase3).

The enzyme's activity involves the metabolism of arachidonic acid to produce 12R-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12R-HPETE), which is part of a metabolic lipoxygenase pathway where its product serves as a substrate for another enzyme, ALOXE3 (Hotz2021MetaAnalysis). This pathway is crucial for the synthesis of specialized lipids that maintain skin hydration and barrier integrity, preventing transepidermal water loss (TEWL) (Jobard2002Lipoxygenase3). The ALOX12B protein structure includes a PLAT (Polycystin-1, Lipoxygenase, α-Toxin) or LH2 (lipoxygenase homology) domain, which mediates interactions with lipids or membrane-bound proteins, highlighting its role in lipid metabolism and skin health (Hotz2021MetaAnalysis).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ALOX12B gene are associated with autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI), a group of rare skin disorders characterized by hyperkeratosis, scaling, and varying degrees of erythroderma (Hotz2021MetaAnalysis). These mutations disrupt the epidermal barrier, leading to abnormal skin development and conditions such as non-bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (NCIE) and self-improving collodion ichthyosis (SICI) (Jobard2002Lipoxygenase3; Zhang2022Identification). Patients with ALOX12B mutations often present with mild erythrodermic ichthyosis, though more severe phenotypes can occur (Hotz2021MetaAnalysis).

The gene is also implicated in primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) in some cases, as seen in a large Iranian pedigree where a specific mutation in ALOX12B was linked to both ichthyosis and POI (Alavi2020Mutation). This mutation, c.G1325A, results in the amino acid change p.Arg442Gln and was found in individuals affected by ichthyosis and in a heterozygous state in those with POI, suggesting a potential association with both conditions (Alavi2020Mutation).

Overall, ALOX12B mutations contribute to a spectrum of skin disorders and may have broader implications for other conditions like POI, highlighting the gene's clinical significance.

## Interactions
ALOX12B, which encodes the enzyme 12R-lipoxygenase (12R-LOX), is involved in lipid metabolism and has been shown to interact with various proteins and nucleic acids. In the context of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), ALOX12B interacts with the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) RPL34-AS1. This interaction was confirmed through RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays, which demonstrated significant enrichment of RPL34-AS1 bound to ALOX12B compared to controls. The study suggests that ALOX12B is involved in a regulatory axis with lncRPL34-AS1, impacting lipid metabolism and oxidative stress regulation in ESCC (Zhang2020H3K4me3).

In the skin, ALOX12B plays a crucial role in the formation of the corneocyte lipid envelope (CLE) and its cross-linking to the proteinaceous corneocyte envelope (CE). This process involves the oxidation of specific lipid groups, facilitating nonenzymatic reactions with peptides on the CE, such as involucrin, envoplakin, and periplakin. This interaction is essential for the proper formation of the CLE and maintaining skin barrier integrity (Meyer2021133). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of ALOX12B in both pathological and physiological processes.
