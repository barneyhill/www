# AK3

## Overview
Adenylate kinase 3 (AK3) is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial enzyme adenylate kinase isozyme 3, which is integral to cellular energy metabolism. This enzyme is categorized as a kinase, specifically involved in the reversible phosphorylation of nucleotides, facilitating the conversion of GTP and AMP to GDP and ADP. AK3's activity is crucial for maintaining the balance of adenine nucleotides, which is essential for ATP production and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, particularly in tissues with high energy demands such as the liver, brain, heart, skeletal muscle, and kidney (Fujisawa2022Adenylate; Panayiotou2014The). The gene's expression levels have been linked to prognostic outcomes in various cancers, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and its involvement in cellular energy homeostasis and drug resistance (Fujisawa2023Regulation).

## Structure
Adenylate kinase 3 (AK3) is a mitochondrial enzyme characterized by its involvement in cellular energy metabolism. The primary structure of AK3 consists of a 227-amino-acid polypeptide chain with a molecular mass of approximately 25.6 kDa (NOMA2001Structure). The secondary structure includes a conserved NMP-kinase fold, which is typical for nucleotide monophosphate kinases, featuring two nucleotide-binding domains: the GTPlid and AMPbd, along with a central core domain (Rogne2020Structural).

The tertiary structure of AK3 is defined by its ability to adopt open substrate-free and closed substrate-bound conformations, which are crucial for its enzymatic function. This structural flexibility is highlighted by significant conformational changes upon substrate binding, as observed in molecular dynamics simulations (Rogne2020Structural). The quaternary structure of AK3 has not been explicitly detailed in the provided context.

AK3 exhibits specific domains for GTP recognition, with key interactions involving residues such as Thr201 and Arg124, which facilitate the enzyme's selectivity for GTP over ATP (Rogne2020Structural). The enzyme's activity is regulated by its structural dynamics, which are essential for its role in mitochondrial metabolism (NOMA2001Structure).

## Function
Adenylate kinase isozyme 3 (AK3) is an enzyme localized in the mitochondrial matrix, where it plays a crucial role in mitochondrial energy metabolism. AK3 catalyzes the reversible reaction Mg2+ GTP + AMP ↔ Mg2+ GDP + ADP, which is essential for maintaining the balance between oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis, critical processes for cell growth and survival (Fujisawa2022Adenylate). This reaction helps regulate the balance of adenine nucleotides, particularly GDP and GTP, which are vital for ATP production and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (Fujisawa2022Adenylate).

In healthy human cells, AK3 is involved in the conversion of succinyl-CoA to succinic acid within the TCA cycle, supplying GDP necessary for this reaction (Fujisawa2022Adenylate). The enzyme's activity is particularly important in tissues with high energy demands, such as the liver, brain, heart, skeletal muscle, and kidney (Panayiotou2014The). AK3's substrate specificity allows it to use only GTP and ITP to phosphorylate AMP, distinguishing it from other adenylate kinase isoforms (Panayiotou2014The). This specificity and its mitochondrial localization underscore its role in energy metabolism, particularly in maintaining the balance of nucleotides necessary for cellular function and survival.

## Clinical Significance
The AK3 gene has clinical significance in various cancers. In breast cancer, higher expression levels of AK3 are associated with a better prognosis, while lower levels correlate with decreased overall survival, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Fujisawa2023Regulation). In bladder urothelial carcinoma, decreased expression of AK3 is linked to a worse prognosis, further supporting its role as a useful marker in cancer prognosis (Fujisawa2023Regulation).

AK3 also plays a role in cellular energy metabolism, as evidenced by studies showing that knockout of AK3 in HeLa cells leads to decreased intracellular ATP levels (Fujisawa2023Regulation). This suggests that alterations in AK3 expression or function could impact cellular energy homeostasis, potentially contributing to metabolic disorders. However, there is a lack of studies involving AK3 knockout in mice, which limits the understanding of its broader physiological and pathological roles (Fujisawa2023Regulation).

Additionally, AK3 has been reported to render cisplatin-resistant cancer cells susceptible to tobacco condensate vapor exposure, indicating a potential role in modulating drug resistance (Fujisawa2023Regulation). This highlights the gene's potential involvement in therapeutic strategies for overcoming drug resistance in cancer treatment.
