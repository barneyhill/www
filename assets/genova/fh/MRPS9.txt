# MRPS9

## Overview
The MRPS9 gene encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S9, a crucial component of the small 28S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein plays a significant role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into functional proteins, which is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular energy production (Cheong2020Expression; Haque2011Contacts). MRPS9 is involved in the assembly and stability of the mitoribosome, interacting with various mitochondrial ribosomal proteins and the mitochondrial translational initiation factor 3 (IF3 mt) (Lopez2021Human; Haque2011Contacts). Beyond its primary role in mitochondrial translation, MRPS9 has been implicated in extramitochondrial functions, including potential involvement in circadian rhythm regulation and cancer-related pathways (Revathi2021Expression). The clinical significance of MRPS9 is underscored by its association with developmental and neurodegenerative disorders, as well as its involvement in a novel fusion mutation with the ALK gene in lung adenocarcinoma, which has implications for targeted cancer therapies (Zhou2021Novel; Gopisetty2016Mammalian).

## Structure
The MRPS9 protein is a component of the small 28S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. It has a molecular weight of approximately 40.5 kDa and an isoelectric point (pI) of 9.9 (O’Brien2003Properties). The primary structure of MRPS9 consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the MRPS9 gene, but specific details on its amino acid sequence or secondary structures such as alpha helices and beta sheets are not provided in the available context.

MRPS9 is localized on the outer surface of the mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit (mt-SSU) and forms extended contacts with 12S mt-rRNA and various other mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, including mS35, uS2m, uS7m, uS10m, and mS29 (DAP3) (Lopez2021Human). This suggests a role in the quaternary structure of the ribosome, where it contributes to the assembly and stability of the ribosomal complex.

The context does not provide specific information on the tertiary structure, post-translational modifications, or splice variant isoforms of MRPS9. The protein's interactions and localization indicate its importance in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the mitochondrial ribosome, although detailed structural data are not available.

## Function
MRPS9 encodes a mitochondrial ribosomal protein that is a component of the small 28S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. It plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into functional proteins, which is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production in cells (Cheong2020Expression; Haque2011Contacts). MRPS9 is involved in the assembly and function of the mitoribosome, with its interactions being critical for the initiation of protein biosynthesis. It interacts with mitochondrial translational initiation factor 3 (IF3 mt), indicating its involvement in the initiation complex formation (Haque2011Contacts).

MRPS9 is located in the head of the small subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome and is noted to be about twice the size of its bacterial homolog, suggesting a specialized role in mitochondrial translation (Haque2011Contacts). The protein is largely situated on the solvent side of the head, with a long extension approaching the P-site, which may imply a role in stabilizing the ribosomal structure during translation (Haque2011Contacts). These functions are vital for the proper functioning of mitochondria, which are essential for cellular energy metabolism.

## Clinical Significance
The MRPS9 gene has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in mitochondrial function. Alterations in MRPS9 expression have been associated with developmental and neurodegenerative disorders, although specific diseases directly linked to MRPS9 mutations are not extensively detailed in the literature (Gopisetty2016Mammalian). In cancer, MRPS9 has been identified in a novel fusion mutation with the ALK gene in a lung adenocarcinoma patient. This MRPS9-ALK fusion retains the intact kinase domain of ALK, which is crucial for the efficacy of ALK-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ALK-TKIs). The patient with this fusion mutation responded well to ALK-TKI treatment, highlighting the potential clinical significance of MRPS9 in cancer therapy (Zhou2021Novel).

Additionally, MRPS9 has been mentioned in the context of mitochondrial dysfunction, where its overexpression in yeast models led to impaired mitochondrial function, suggesting that similar disruptions in humans could contribute to mitochondrial disorders (Wiltshire1999Overexpression). However, specific diseases or conditions directly resulting from MRPS9 mutations or expression changes remain underexplored, necessitating further research to elucidate its clinical significance fully.

## Interactions
MRPS9, a component of the mitochondrial ribosomal small subunit, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that suggest roles beyond its primary function in mitochondrial translation. MRPS9 interacts with several proteins, including HIST1H2BB, NPAS2, TLN2, WAPL, GOLGA2, ROS1, FRY, and BCKDHB, as identified through GST pull-down assays followed by LC/MS/MS analysis. These interactions indicate potential extramitochondrial functions, such as involvement in circadian rhythm regulation and proto-oncogene activity (Revathi2021Expression).

MRPS9 also interacts with the mammalian mitochondrial translational initiation factor 3 (IF3 mt). Cross-linking studies have shown that MRPS9 is located near the IF3 mt binding site on the 28S subunit, suggesting a role in the initiation of mitochondrial protein synthesis (Haque2011Contacts). The interaction between MRPS9 and IF3 mt is facilitated by the unique structural features of the mitochondrial ribosome, which differ from bacterial systems (Haque2011Contacts).

Additionally, MRPS9 has been implicated in cancer-related pathways. It interacts with ROS1 kinase, suggesting a role in ROS1 kinase-related signaling pathways, which are significant in cancer therapy, particularly for non-small-cell lung cancer (Revathi2021Expression). These interactions highlight the potential extraribosomal functions of MRPS9 in diverse cellular processes.
