# TGFBR3L

## Overview
The TGFBR3L gene encodes the transforming growth factor beta receptor 3 like protein, which is a member of the receptor family involved in the TGF-beta signaling pathway. This protein is categorized as a receptor and is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. The TGFBR3L protein is structurally similar to other members of the TGF-beta receptor family, suggesting a potential role in modulating TGF-beta signaling, although its specific functions and interactions remain to be fully elucidated. Research into TGFBR3L may provide insights into its involvement in developmental processes and disease mechanisms, particularly in the context of its expression patterns and regulatory pathways.
