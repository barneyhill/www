# KIF4A

## Overview
KIF4A is a gene that encodes the protein kinesin family member 4A, a motor protein belonging to the kinesin-4 family. This protein plays a crucial role in cellular processes such as chromosome condensation and segregation during mitosis, as well as DNA repair and replication. Kinesin family member 4A is characterized by its motor domain, which facilitates ATP binding and microtubule interaction, enabling its mechanochemical activity. The protein's structure also includes a coiled-coil stalk region and a C-terminal domain, which are essential for its interactions with chromatin and other proteins. KIF4A is involved in the organization of the central spindle midzone during cell division and is implicated in neuronal development and synaptic function. Alterations in the expression or mutations of the KIF4A gene have been associated with various diseases, including intellectual disabilities and several types of cancer, highlighting its significance in maintaining genomic stability and proper cellular function (Willemsen2014Involvement; Wu2008Structural; Mazumdar2004Human).

## Structure
KIF4A is a motor protein that belongs to the kinesin-4 family, characterized by a highly conserved structure. The protein consists of an N-terminal motor domain, a coiled-coil stalk region, and a C-terminal domain. The motor domain is responsible for ATP binding and microtubule interaction, providing the mechanochemical activity necessary for its function in mitosis (Sheng2018The; Wu2008Structural). The coiled-coil region includes a leucine Zip/Basic/leucine Zip (ZBZ) domain, which is thought to contain a nuclear localization signal and is crucial for chromatin binding (Wu2008Structural). The C-terminal domain contains a cysteine-rich motif, which is essential for chromatin association and interaction with other proteins such as PRC1 (Wu2008Structural).

KIF4A's structure allows it to interact with condensed chromosomes during mitosis and DNA during interphase, playing a role in chromosome condensation, DNA repair, and replication (Sheng2018The). The protein's interaction with condensin complexes I and II is vital for maintaining chromosome architecture, and its depletion leads to defects in chromosome structure and mitotic spindle organization (Mazumdar2004Human).

## Function
KIF4A is a chromokinesin motor protein that plays a critical role in chromosome condensation and segregation during mitosis. It localizes to the nucleoplasm during interphase and associates with condensed chromosome arms during mitosis, ensuring proper chromosome alignment at metaphase and segregation during anaphase (Mazumdar2004Human). KIF4A interacts with condensin complexes I and II, which are essential for chromosome condensation, and its depletion leads to hypercondensation of chromosomes and defects in chromosome structure (Mazumdar2004Human).

KIF4A is also involved in the organization of the central spindle midzone during cell division. It interacts with PRC1, a microtubule-binding protein, to ensure the proper localization of midzone-associated proteins and the formation of an organized central spindle, which is crucial for successful cytokinesis (Kurasawa2004Essential). In neurons, KIF4A is implicated in synaptic function and neuronal development, where it transports essential cargoes such as the adhesion molecule L1, necessary for axon formation and synapse development (Willemsen2014Involvement). Overall, KIF4A is vital for maintaining genomic stability and proper cell division, contributing to normal cellular and organismal function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the KIF4A gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In intellectual disability, a specific mutation in KIF4A, c.1489-8_1490delins10, disrupts the splice site of exon 15, leading to its skipping and an in-frame deletion in the protein. This mutation is associated with X-linked recessive intellectual disability, segregating with the phenotype in affected males and resulting in lower molecular weight and reduced expression levels of KIF4A in patient cells (Willemsen2014Involvement).

KIF4A is also linked to various cancers. In osteosarcoma, KIF4A is upregulated, correlating with poor survival and promoting tumor growth through the MAPK signaling pathway (Zhu2021Enhanced). In renal cell carcinoma, high KIF4A expression is associated with poor prognosis and increased tumor proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis (Liu2020The). Similarly, in hepatocellular carcinoma, KIF4A overexpression is linked to poor prognosis and enhanced cell proliferation via the Akt signaling pathway (Huang2018Upregulation). In colorectal cancer, KIF4A promotes tumor growth and metastasis by regulating the cell cycle and PI3K/AKT signaling (Hou2018KIF4A).

Additionally, missense variants in KIF4A are associated with dental morphogenesis disorders, such as X-linked taurodontism, microdontia, and dens invaginatus, indicating its role in tooth development (Gowans2019Missense).

## Interactions
KIF4A, a member of the kinesin family, is involved in several critical interactions during mitosis. It physically interacts with the condensin I and II complexes, which are essential for chromosome condensation and segregation. This interaction is crucial for the proper localization of condensin components on chromosomes, and depletion of KIF4A leads to a diffuse distribution of these components, resulting in hypercondensation of chromosomes and defects in chromosome structure (Mazumdar2004Human).

KIF4A also interacts with PRC1, a protein required for cytokinesis. This interaction is essential for the translocation of PRC1 to the spindle midzone during the metaphase-to-anaphase transition, facilitating cytokinesis. KIF4A specifically binds to unphosphorylated PRC1, and this interaction is regulated by Cdk phosphorylation (Zhu2004Cell).

Additionally, KIF4A is involved in a SUMOylation-dependent interaction with the microtubule destabilizer Stathmin 1 (STMN1). SUMOylation of KIF4A enhances its binding to STMN1, which is crucial for the regulation of cytokinesis, particularly during the abscission phase (Cuijpers2020Chromokinesin).

KIF4A also interacts with DNA and chromatin-associated proteins, including DNMT3B and BRCA2-associated factor 35, playing roles in DNA replication and repair (Sheng2018The).
