# ESPN

## Overview
The ESPN gene encodes the espin protein, a multifunctional actin-bundling protein that plays a critical role in the organization and maintenance of actin filament structures, particularly in sensory hair cells of the inner ear. Espin is characterized by its ability to bind and bundle actin filaments in a calcium-insensitive manner, which is essential for the stability of actin-rich structures such as stereocilia. These structures are vital for auditory and vestibular functions, and mutations in the ESPN gene can lead to hearing loss and balance disorders. Espin interacts with various proteins, including class III myosins and whirlin, to facilitate the assembly and maintenance of actin bundles. Additionally, altered expression of ESPN has been implicated in certain cancers, such as esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, highlighting its broader significance in cellular function and disease (Sekerkova2004Espins; Liu2016Myosin; Li2018An).

## Structure
The espin protein, encoded by the ESPN gene, is a multifunctional actin-bundling protein crucial for the organization of actin filaments. It consists of 854 amino acids and features several key structural domains. The protein includes eight ankyrin-like repeats at the N-terminus, which are involved in protein-protein interactions (Naz2004Mutations). Espin also contains two proline-rich domains, a WH2 motif for actin monomer binding, and a coiled coil region (Naz2004Mutations; Liu2016Myosin). The C-terminal region of espin includes an actin-bundling module (ABM) with two actin-binding sites essential for its bundling activity (Naz2004Mutations).

Espin exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which affects its function in different cellular contexts. These isoforms can include additional F-actin-binding sites and may lack certain domains, such as ankyrin-like repeats, depending on the specific isoform (Sekerková2003Novel). The protein's actin-bundling activity is calcium-insensitive, which is significant for maintaining the stability of actin structures in environments with fluctuating calcium levels (Sekerková2003Novel). The structural features of espin are critical for its role in sensory cells, particularly in the maintenance and elongation of hair cell stereocilia.

## Function
The ESPN gene encodes the espin protein, which is a multifunctional actin cytoskeletal regulatory protein crucial for the organization and function of actin filament bundles in sensory hair cells of the inner ear. Espins are primarily active in the microvilli of various sensory cells, including hair cell stereocilia, where they play a significant role in maintaining the structure and function of these actin-rich projections (Sekerkova2004Espins; Rzadzinska2005Balanced). 

Espins are involved in actin cytoskeleton dynamics, contributing to cellular processes like mechanotransduction. They bundle actin filaments with high affinity in a calcium-resistant manner, which is essential for sensory cells that experience transient increases in calcium during signal transduction (Sekerkova2004Espins). Espins also interact with proteins such as profilin and phospholipids like PIP2, influencing actin filament dynamics and cellular signaling pathways (Sekerkova2004Espins).

In the inner ear, espins are critical for the proper formation and maintenance of stereocilia, which are necessary for hearing and balance. Mutations in the espin gene can lead to defects in stereocilia structure, resulting in conditions such as deafness and vestibular dysfunction (Liu2016Myosin; Sekerkova2011Roles).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ESPN gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting hearing and balance. Autosomal recessive mutations in ESPN, such as frameshift mutations 1988delAGAG and 2469delGTCA, lead to profound sensorineural hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction, characterized by vestibular areflexia (Naz2004Mutations). These mutations result in a loss of function of the espin protein, which is crucial for the proper organization of actin filaments in hair cell stereocilia (Naz2004Mutations).

In addition to hearing loss, certain ESPN mutations are linked to Usher syndrome type I, which includes vestibulopathy and vision impairment. An inframe deletion in ESPN, identified as c.2369_2386delAGGCGGGACCTCCTGCGG, impairs the actin-bundling ability of espin, contributing to the Usher syndrome phenotype (Ahmed2018Inframe).

ESPN mutations can also cause autosomal dominant hearing loss. Specific missense mutations, such as S719R and D744N, and a deletion mutation, delK848, have been linked to this condition. These mutations disrupt the elongation and organization of microvillar actin bundles, leading to hearing impairment (Donaudy2005Espin).

Altered ESPN expression is associated with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), where high ESPN levels correlate with poor prognosis and reduced survival rates (Li2018An).

## Interactions
Espin (ESPN) is an actin-binding protein that interacts with several other proteins, playing a crucial role in the organization and maintenance of actin filaments in structures such as stereocilia. Espin 1, a member of the espin family, interacts with actin filaments through multiple actin-binding domains, including an extra actin binding site (xAB), a C-terminal actin binding domain (ABD), and a G-actin binding domain known as the WASP homology 2 (WH2) domain. This interaction allows espin 1 to induce actin bundling, which is essential for the elongation and stabilization of stereocilia (Yang2022Studies).

Espin 1 also interacts with class III myosins, specifically Myo3a and Myo3b. These interactions are mediated through the ankyrin repeat (AR) region of espin 1, which binds to the tail homology domain I (THDI) of Myo3. This binding releases the auto-inhibition of espin 1, enhancing its actin bundling activity and facilitating the formation of thicker actin bundles (Liu2016Myosin). The interaction between espin and myosin III is crucial for the development and maintenance of stereocilia, as it promotes the assembly and stability of higher-order parallel actin bundles (Liu2016Myosin).

Espin also interacts with whirlin, a protein involved in the molecular mechanisms underlying Usher syndrome type II. In whirlin knockout mice, the expression of espin isoforms is altered, indicating a compensatory mechanism and suggesting that espin and whirlin interact in vivo (Wang2011Whirlin).
