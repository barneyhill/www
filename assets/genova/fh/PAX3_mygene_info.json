Members of the PAX family typically contain a paired box domain and a paired-type homeodomain. These genes play critical roles during fetal development.

The translocation t(2;13)(q35;q14), which represents a fusion between PAX3 and the forkhead gene, is a frequent finding in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. Alternative splicing results in transcripts encoding isoforms with different C-termini.
