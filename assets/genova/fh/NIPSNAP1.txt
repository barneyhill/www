# NIPSNAP1

## Overview
NIPSNAP1 is a gene that encodes the nipsnap homolog 1 protein, which is involved in various cellular processes, particularly in mitochondrial function and neurological activities. The nipsnap homolog 1 protein is categorized as a mitochondrial and synaptic protein, playing a significant role in mitochondrial metabolism and cellular signaling. It is implicated in the regulation of mitochondrial quality control and energy production, interacting with key metabolic enzymes and participating in mitophagy. Additionally, the protein is involved in calcium transport regulation and has been associated with pain transmission and synaptic activity. NIPSNAP1 is expressed in several tissues, including the brain, liver, kidney, and adrenal gland, and its dysregulation is linked to neurological disorders and cancer, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target (Schoeber2008Identification; Abudu2019NIPSNAP1; Fathi2021NIPSNAP).

## Structure
The NIPSNAP1 protein is composed of 284 amino acids, with a predicted molecular weight of approximately 33.4 kDa (Seroussi1998Characterization). The protein exhibits strong sequence similarity to a hypothetical protein from C. elegans, particularly in the central portion, which resembles a 4-nitrophenylphosphatase domain and a non-neuronal SNAP25-like protein (Seroussi1998Characterization). This suggests potential roles in vesicular transport, as SNAP25 is part of the SNARE complex involved in synaptic vesicle docking and fusion (Seroussi1998Characterization).

NIPSNAP1 is expressed as a mature 29-kDa protein form, which is found in the synaptic membrane and mitochondrial fractions of the brain (OkudaAshitaka2012Identification). The protein is involved in pain transmission through its interaction with nocistatin (NST), characterized by a high-affinity binding site with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 5.8 nM (OkudaAshitaka2012Identification). Immunoblot analysis has revealed both a 33-kDa full-length protein and a 29-kDa truncated form, with the latter detected on the cell surface, suggesting a role in cell signaling (OkudaAshitaka2012Identification). The protein's localization and interaction with other proteins, such as the transient receptor potential vanilloid channel (TRPV6) and the amyloid precursor protein, indicate its involvement in cellular signaling pathways (OkudaAshitaka2012Identification).

## Function
NIPSNAP1 is a protein that plays a crucial role in mitochondrial metabolism and neurological functions. It is involved in mitochondrial metabolic processes by interacting with the E2 subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) and the transacetylase of branched-chain alpha-keto acid (BCKA) dehydrogenase, which are essential for energy production and metabolic regulation (Fathi2021NIPSNAP). NIPSNAP1 is also implicated in mitophagy, acting as an 'eat-me' signal on the outer mitochondrial membrane to recruit autophagy receptors and facilitate the degradation of damaged mitochondria, which is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis, especially in neurons (Abudu2019NIPSNAP1).

In addition to its role in mitochondrial health, NIPSNAP1 is involved in regulating calcium transport by inhibiting the activity of the TRPV6 calcium channel at the cell surface, which promotes apoptosis and suggests a potential tumor suppressor role (Schoeber2008Identification; Fathi2021NIPSNAP). NIPSNAP1 is highly expressed in the brain, liver, kidney, and adrenal gland, indicating its involvement in the functions of these tissues, particularly in synaptic activity and learning and memory processes (Fathi2021NIPSNAP).

## Clinical Significance
NIPSNAP1 is implicated in several neurological and metabolic disorders due to its role in mitochondrial function and cellular metabolism. Alterations in NIPSNAP1 expression have been observed in phenylketonuric (PKU) and epileptic mice, suggesting a potential role in these neurological conditions (Nautiyal2010Neuronal). In Parkinson's disease, NIPSNAP1 is associated with mitochondrial quality control, and its deficiency can lead to Parkinson's-like phenotypes in zebrafish (Fathi2021NIPSNAP). The gene's interaction with the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is relevant to Alzheimer's disease, where it may influence synaptic activity and neuronal health (Nautiyal2010Neuronal).

In cancer, NIPSNAP1 appears to function as a tumor suppressor. Its inactivation is associated with metastatic prostate cancer, potentially due to its role in inhibiting TRPV6, an anti-apoptotic oncogene (Malhotra2013Chromosomal). NIPSNAP1 also modulates reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, influencing cancer cell proliferation and senescence, which suggests its involvement in cancer progression (Gao2023NIPSNAP1). These findings highlight the clinical significance of NIPSNAP1 in both neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
NIPSNAP1 is involved in several protein interactions that influence various cellular processes. It interacts with nocistatin (NST), a protein involved in pain transmission, with high affinity. This interaction was confirmed through binding assays and immunoprecipitation experiments, indicating that NIPSNAP1 is a specific interacting partner of NST (OkudaAshitaka2012Identification).

In cancer cells, NIPSNAP1 interacts with superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) and sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), enhancing SOD2's antioxidant activity through SIRT3-mediated deacetylation. This interaction plays a role in regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and cellular senescence (Gao2023NIPSNAP1). NIPSNAP1 also interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXL14, which stabilizes the c-Myc protein by preventing its degradation. This interaction is crucial for maintaining c-Myc levels and regulating cell proliferation and senescence (Gao2023NIPSNAP1).

NIPSNAP1 has been identified as an auxiliary protein that inhibits the activity of the epithelial calcium channel TRPV6. It interacts with TRPV6, reducing its activity without affecting its expression on the plasma membrane (Schoeber2008Identification). These interactions highlight NIPSNAP1's role in modulating various physiological processes.
