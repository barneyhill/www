# NAALAD2

## Overview
NAALAD2 is a gene that encodes the protein N-acetylated alpha-linked acidic dipeptidase 2, a type II transmembrane protein belonging to the transferrin receptor/glutamate carboxypeptidase II family. This protein is primarily involved in the hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG), playing a significant role in modulating neurotransmitter levels and influencing glutamatergic signaling in the brain (Pangalos1999Isolation). NAALAD2 is expressed in various human tissues, including the brain, prostate, and reproductive organs, and is crucial for maintaining proper neuronal function and communication (Lambert2006Molecular). The gene's expression and promoter methylation have been linked to prostate cancer, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for disease severity and prognosis (Daniunaite2021Promoter).

## Structure
NAALAD2 is a type II transmembrane protein that is part of the transferrin receptor/glutamate carboxypeptidase II family. It features a large extracellular domain responsible for its enzymatic activity, which includes hydrolyzing N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate (NAAG) and glutamate (Lambert2006Molecular; Konvalinka2019GCPII). The protein shares 67% amino acid sequence identity with glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) and has a similar three-dimensional structure, forming homodimers with each monomer folding into three domains: the protease-like domain, the apical domain, and the C-terminal or dimerization domain (Konvalinka2019GCPII).

NAALAD2 is posttranslationally N-glycosylated, which is crucial for its enzymatic activities (Konvalinka2019GCPII). The protein is encoded by a large gene with at least 32 exons and six different transcripts, indicating the presence of multiple splice variant isoforms that may contribute to structural diversity (Lambert2006Molecular). The protein's structure includes conserved motifs and domains that are essential for its function, although specific details on the primary, secondary, and tertiary structures are not provided in the available context (Lambert2006Molecular).

## Function
NAALAD2, also known as N-acetylated alpha-linked acidic dipeptidase 2, is a gene that encodes a type II transmembrane protein involved in the hydrolysis of N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG), a neurotransmitter in the brain. This protein is part of the M28 peptidase family and plays a crucial role in neurotransmitter regulation by modulating levels of NAAG, which acts as a weak partial agonist at N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and provides neuroprotection by binding to type II metabotropic glutamate receptors, thereby reducing glutaminergic neurotransmission (Pangalos1999Isolation).

NAALAD2 is expressed in various human tissues, including the testis, ovary, spleen, prostate gland, heart, and placenta, as well as in brain regions such as the striatum and parietal cortex (Lambert2006Molecular). The protein is primarily active in the cell membrane, where it contributes to synaptic transmission and neuronal communication by hydrolyzing NAAG into glutamate and N-acetylaspartate, influencing glutamatergic signaling processes (Carter1996Prostatespecific). The enzymatic activity of NAALAD2 is essential for maintaining proper neurotransmitter levels, which is critical for normal neuronal function and communication.

## Clinical Significance
NAALAD2 has been implicated in prostate cancer through its promoter methylation and expression levels. Studies have shown that NAALAD2 exhibits significantly higher promoter methylation in prostate cancer tissues compared to non-cancerous prostate tissue and benign prostatic hyperplasia samples. This hypermethylation is associated with reduced expression of NAALAD2 in cancerous tissues, suggesting a role in tumor progression (Daniunaite2021Promoter). The methylation frequency of NAALAD2 increases with higher ISUP grade groups, indicating its potential involvement in disease severity. Lower expression levels of NAALAD2 correlate with higher postoperative ISUP grade groups, suggesting its utility as a biomarker for prostate cancer severity (Daniunaite2021Promoter).

NAALAD2 promoter methylation also shows prognostic potential for predicting biochemical recurrence (BCR) of prostate cancer. When combined with clinical factors such as pT stage or ISUP grade group, NAALAD2 methylation outperforms traditional clinico-pathological characteristics in predicting BCR-free survival (Daniunaite2021Promoter). These findings highlight the potential of NAALAD2 as a valuable biomarker for prostate cancer prognosis, although further validation is required for clinical application (Daniunaite2021Promoter).
