# PROSER2

## Overview
PROSER2, or proline and serine rich 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in cancer biology. The protein encoded by PROSER2 is characterized by its rich content of proline and serine residues, which may contribute to its role in protein-protein interactions and signaling pathways. Notably, PROSER2 has been implicated in the regulation of telomere maintenance and signaling pathways such as Wnt/Ca2+/NFATc1, which are crucial in the progression of cancers like cutaneous malignant melanoma and osteosarcoma (Li2022PROSER2; Yepes2020Using). Additionally, phosphoproteomics studies suggest that PROSER2 may interact with protein kinase A catalytic subunits, indicating its involvement in phosphorylation-dependent regulatory mechanisms (Raghuram2020Protein). The gene's expression and interactions have been linked to clinical outcomes in various cancers, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for disease prognosis and susceptibility (Wu2023Long; Zhang2023Cuproplasia).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
PROSER2 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through its interactions and expression levels. In the context of cutaneous melanoma, PROSER2 is identified as a candidate gene for germline susceptibility. It interacts with known high-risk melanoma genes such as POT1 and TERF2IP, which are involved in telomere maintenance, suggesting a potential role in melanoma susceptibility (Yepes2020Using). A variant in the splicing region of PROSER2 was observed in multiple cases within a family affected by cutaneous malignant melanoma, indicating its possible involvement in the disease (Yepes2020Using).

In colorectal cancer, the long non-coding RNA PROSER2-AS1, associated with PROSER2, may regulate genes involved in the Rap1 and RAS signaling pathways, potentially leading to a poorer prognosis (Wu2023Long). Additionally, PROSER2 is part of a prognostic model for colon cancer, where its expression is linked to survival outcomes (Zhang2023Cuproplasia).

In osteosarcoma, PROSER2 is listed among hub genes in a prognostic risk model, suggesting its potential relevance in the disease's prognosis, although specific details on its role are not provided (Jiang2024Establishment).

## Interactions
PROSER2, also known as proline and serine rich 2, is involved in various protein interactions that are significant in cancer biology. In the context of cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM), PROSER2 has been identified as interacting closely with known CMM genes within the telomere biology cluster. This includes interactions with genes such as POT1 and TERF2IP, which are crucial for telomere maintenance (Yepes2020Using). These interactions suggest a potential role for PROSER2 in the genetic heterogeneity observed in CMM.

In osteosarcoma, PROSER2 is implicated in the Wnt/Ca2+/NFATc1 signaling pathway. Knockdown of PROSER2 in osteosarcoma cells results in decreased expression of proteins such as Wnt5a, COX2, MMP-2, and MMP-9, indicating that PROSER2 may regulate these proteins through this pathway (Li2022PROSER2). This pathway is significant in cancer progression, highlighting PROSER2's role in promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in osteosarcoma (Li2022PROSER2).

Additionally, phosphoproteomics studies have shown that PROSER2 undergoes changes in phosphorylation levels, particularly in the absence of PKA-Cβ, suggesting a regulatory interaction with protein kinase A catalytic subunits (Raghuram2020Protein). These interactions underscore the multifaceted role of PROSER2 in cellular processes and cancer development.
