# MYO1E

## Overview
MYO1E is a gene that encodes the protein myosin IE, a member of the unconventional class I myosins. Myosin IE is a long-tailed myosin protein involved in various cellular processes, including clathrin-mediated endocytosis, actin dynamics, and membrane trafficking. It is characterized by a motor domain that facilitates actin binding and ATP hydrolysis, a neck domain with an IQ calmodulin-binding motif, and a tail domain that includes TH1, TH2, and SH3 domains. These structural features enable myosin IE to interact with other proteins and phospholipids, playing a critical role in cellular functions such as phagocytosis, antigen presentation, and maintaining the integrity of cell-cell junctions in podocytes. Mutations in MYO1E have been linked to kidney disorders like focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, as well as certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Krendel2007Myosin; Mele2011MYO1EMutations; NavinésFerrer2020LongTailed).

## Structure
MYO1E is a type I myosin protein characterized by a distinct molecular structure comprising several domains. The protein includes an N-terminal motor domain responsible for actin binding and ATP hydrolysis, a neck domain with an IQ calmodulin-binding motif, and a tail domain (Cheng2012Myosin; Krendel2007Myosin). The tail domain is further divided into the TH1, TH2, and SH3 domains. The TH1 domain is positively charged and may interact with membrane phospholipids, while the TH2 region is proline-rich (Krendel2007Myosin). The SH3 domain is involved in protein-protein interactions, binding to proline-rich domains in proteins like synaptojanin-1 and dynamin, which are crucial for endocytosis (Krendel2007Myosin).

MYO1E lacks the C-terminal CA domain found in yeast myosins, which is important for activating the Arp2/3 complex (Cheng2012Myosin). The protein is involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and actin assembly, with its SH3 domain playing a significant role in these processes (Cheng2012Myosin). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may regulate MYO1E's activity, although specific details are not provided in the context. Splice variants of MYO1E may exist, potentially affecting its functional domains and interactions.

## Function
MYO1E, a long-tailed unconventional class I myosin, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, particularly in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). It is involved in the recruitment of actin-regulatory proteins such as WIP, WIRE, and N-WASP, which are essential for actin polymerization and the formation of endocytic vesicles (Cheng2012Myosin). The SH3 domain of MYO1E is necessary for these interactions, facilitating the coordination of actin assembly and cargo trafficking during endocytosis (Cheng2012Myosin).

MYO1E is also significant in immune cell functions, particularly in macrophages and dendritic cells, where it regulates processes like phagocytosis and antigen presentation. It aids in the exocytosis of cytoplasmic vesicles to the plasma membrane, crucial for antigen presentation and T cell proliferation (NavinésFerrer2020LongTailed). In macrophages, MYO1E is involved in the formation and closure of the phagocytic cup, linking the plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeleton, which is vital for efficient phagocytosis (NavinésFerrer2020LongTailed).

In podocytes, MYO1E is essential for maintaining the integrity of cell-cell junctions and the glomerular filtration barrier, linking plasma membrane phospholipids and actin filaments (NavinésFerrer2020LongTailed). Its role in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular structure and function in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MYO1E gene have been implicated in several kidney disorders, most notably childhood-onset, glucocorticoid-resistant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). This condition is characterized by nephrotic syndrome, which includes symptoms such as proteinuria, hematuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema. Specific mutations, such as A159P and Y695X, have been identified as causative factors in FSGS, with these mutations segregating with the disease in affected families. The A159P mutation affects the motor-head domain of Myo1E, impairing its function and causing mislocalization within podocytes, while the Y695X mutation results in a truncated protein lacking essential domains (Mele2011MYO1EMutations).

MYO1E mutations are also associated with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS), where they affect the localization, dynamics, and activity of myosin 1E, leading to podocyte dysfunction and kidney damage (Liu2022SteroidResistant).

In addition to kidney disorders, MYO1E overexpression has been linked to non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), particularly lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). High MYO1E expression in LUAD is associated with increased mortality risk and shorter survival times, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic marker in this cancer type (JusueTorres2023Myo1e).

## Interactions
MYO1E, a member of the myosin-I family, is involved in various protein interactions that play crucial roles in cellular processes such as endocytosis and actin dynamics. MYO1E interacts with synaptojanin-1 and dynamin, two proteins essential for endocytosis. These interactions occur through the SH3 domain of MYO1E, which binds to the proline-rich domains of synaptojanin-1 and dynamin, facilitating their roles in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Cheng2012Myosin; Krendel2007Myosin). The SH3 domain of MYO1E is also involved in recruiting actin-regulatory proteins like WIP, WIRE, and N-WASP, which are critical for actin polymerization during endocytosis (Cheng2012Myosin).

MYO1E interacts with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) through its SH3 domain, binding to the proline-rich region 1 (PRR1) of FAK. This interaction induces FAK autophosphorylation at tyrosine 397, which is significant for FAK activity and is implicated in cancer-related processes (Heim2017Myosin1E). MYO1E also binds to anionic phospholipids, such as phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate, through its tail domain, which is important for its localization to clathrin-coated vesicles and its function in membrane dynamics (Feeser2010Myo1e). These interactions highlight MYO1E's role in coordinating actin assembly and cargo trafficking in cellular processes.
