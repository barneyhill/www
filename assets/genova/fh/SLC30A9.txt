# SLC30A9

## Overview
SLC30A9 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 30 member 9 (ZnT9), which is a zinc transporter involved in maintaining cellular zinc homeostasis. ZnT9 is categorized as a transmembrane protein, characterized by its six transmembrane domains and a cytosolic N-terminus, which are typical features of the ZnT family of zinc transporters (RocaUmbert2023Human). The protein is primarily localized in the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, where it plays a critical role in exporting zinc from mitochondria, thereby regulating mitochondrial zinc levels and ensuring proper mitochondrial function and structure (Kowalczyk2021Evolutionary; Ma2021A). This function is essential for preventing zinc accumulation, which can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction. SLC30A9 has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including Birk-Landau-Perez syndrome, and its expression levels have been associated with diseases such as gastric cancer and Autism Spectrum Disorder (Liu2024Integrative; Guo2020Comprehensive; Csikós2021Zinc).

## Structure
The SLC30A9 gene encodes the ZnT9 protein, a zinc transporter involved in cellular zinc homeostasis. ZnT9 is predicted to have six transmembrane domains and a cytosolic N-terminus, similar to other members of the ZnT family (RocaUmbert2023Human). The protein's molecular structure is characterized by conserved motifs, including the ExxHxxxD sequence found in its transmembrane domains, which distinguishes SLC30A9 from other SLC30A proteins (Kowalczyk2021Evolutionary). 

ZnT9 is partially localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, suggesting a role in mitochondria-ER contact sites (RocaUmbert2023Human). The protein acts as a mitochondrial zinc exporter, crucial for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and metabolism (Kizhakkedath2023Case). A specific non-synonymous SNP, Met50Val, located in the N-terminus, may affect zinc homeostasis by influencing zinc transport or protein interactions (RocaUmbert2023Human). 

The protein has remained a single-copy orthologous group throughout evolution, unlike other SLC30A family members, which have undergone multiple duplications (Kowalczyk2021Evolutionary). The tertiary and quaternary structures of ZnT9, including potential interactions with other proteins, remain less well-defined in the current literature.

## Function
The SLC30A9 gene encodes a zinc transporter protein, ZnT9, which plays a crucial role in maintaining zinc homeostasis within human cells. ZnT9 is primarily involved in exporting zinc from mitochondria, thereby regulating mitochondrial zinc levels and ensuring proper mitochondrial function and structure (Kowalczyk2021Evolutionary; Ma2021A). This function is essential for preventing zinc accumulation, which can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by reduced membrane potentials and decreased ATP levels (Ma2021A).

ZnT9 is localized in the mitochondria, as confirmed by its co-localization with mitochondrial markers and its evolutionary rate covariation with mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation components (Kowalczyk2021Evolutionary). The protein is also partially localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting a role in mitochondria-ER contact sites (RocaUmbert2023Human).

Mutations in SLC30A9 can lead to disorders such as Birk-Landau-Perez syndrome, highlighting its importance in zinc transport and cellular health (Csikós2021Zinc). The gene's function is critical for various cellular processes, including mitochondrial metabolism and systemic metabolism, potentially influencing traits like lean body mass and neuropsychiatric conditions (RocaUmbert2023Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC30A9 gene are linked to Birk-Landau-Perez syndrome (BILAPES), an autosomal recessive cerebro-renal syndrome. This condition is characterized by neurological deterioration, intellectual disability, hearing loss, oculomotor apraxia, nephropathy, ataxia, and dyskinesia. The syndrome is often associated with an in-frame deletion in SLC30A9 (p.Ala350del), which results in a loss-of-function allele, leading to zinc accumulation and mitochondrial stress (Kizhakkedath2023Case). 

SLC30A9 mutations have also been implicated in a novel autosomal recessive cerebro-renal syndrome, first reported in a consanguineous Bedouin family. This syndrome includes symptoms such as decreased renal function, developmental delays, and various neurological impairments (Kleyner2021Autosomal). 

Altered expression of SLC30A9 is associated with gastric cancer, where its high expression correlates with a favorable prognosis. SLC30A9 expression is significantly upregulated in gastric tumor tissues and is linked to advanced tumor stage and nodal metastasis status (Guo2020Comprehensive). 

In postmenopausal women, decreased expression of SLC30A9 in vaginal tissues may contribute to changes in the extracellular matrix composition, potentially affecting vaginal health (Csikós2021Zinc).

## Interactions
SLC30A9, a zinc transporter, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It has been identified as interacting with the nucleoprotein (NP) of both swine and human influenza A viruses (IAV) through a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system. This interaction suggests a potential role in the viral life cycle, particularly in replication, and highlights SLC30A9 as a possible host target that may confer resistance to IAV infection (Generous2014Identification).

SLC30A9 is also involved in zinc homeostasis and has been identified as a mitochondrial zinc transporter. It coevolves with components of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation chain, indicating its role in mitochondrial zinc handling. This interaction is unique compared to other members of the SLC30A family, suggesting a distinct function in zinc export from mitochondria (Kowalczyk2021Evolutionary).

Additionally, SLC30A9 has been linked to neuronal inhibition and endothelial cell maturation, with its protein levels associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). It is involved in essential metabolic processes, including zinc ion homeostasis, and participates in protein-protein interaction networks related to these functions (Liu2024Integrative).
