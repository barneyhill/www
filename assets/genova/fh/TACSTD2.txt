# TACSTD2

## Overview
TACSTD2, also known as tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 2 or Trop2, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein involved in various cellular processes, including calcium signaling and cell proliferation. The protein encoded by TACSTD2 is categorized as a transmembrane receptor and plays a critical role in mediating calcium signal transduction, which is essential for numerous physiological functions. It is implicated in the regulation of tight junctions and cellular interactions, particularly in the context of viral entry and cancer progression. TACSTD2's involvement in signaling pathways, such as the Akt kinase pathway, highlights its significance in cell proliferation and migration, making it a key player in oncogenic processes. Mutations and epigenetic alterations in the TACSTD2 gene have been linked to diseases such as gelatinous drop-like corneal dystrophy and various cancers, underscoring its clinical relevance (Rapani1998Human; Lenárt2020Trop2:; Katzendorn2021DNA).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TACSTD2 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. Gelatinous drop-like corneal dystrophy (GDLD) is a rare autosomal recessive eye disease caused by pathogenic variants in the TACSTD2 gene. GDLD is characterized by the loss of barrier function in corneal epithelial cells and amyloid deposition, leading to symptoms such as lacrimation, photophobia, and blurred vision. Mutations in TACSTD2 disrupt protein expression, resulting in increased corneal permeability and compromised tight junction formation (Alavi2007Four; Skorodumova2024TACSTD2).

In cancer, altered expression of TACSTD2 is linked to the aggressiveness and progression of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Higher methylation levels of TACSTD2 are associated with more advanced stages of RCC, including metastasis and high tumor stage. This epigenetic silencing leads to a loss of TACSTD2 mRNA and protein expression, correlating with shorter recurrence-free survival (Katzendorn2021DNA).

In squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), loss of TACSTD2 expression is associated with poorly differentiated tissues and contributes to disease progression by attenuating TAp63-dependent apoptosis. This loss may promote treatment resistance by reducing apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic agents (Wang2014Loss).

## Interactions
TACSTD2, also known as Trop2, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It interacts with claudin-1 (CLDN1) and occludin (OCLN), which are essential components of tight junctions. These interactions are significant for the entry of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) into hepatocytes, as TACSTD2 regulates the phosphorylation and cellular localization of these proteins through protein kinase C (PKC) (Sekhar2018Infection). 

TACSTD2 also participates in calcium signaling, where it acts as a calcium signal transducer. This role is highlighted by its ability to induce intracellular calcium release upon stimulation, even in the absence of extracellular calcium (Rapani1998Human). 

In cancer, TACSTD2 interacts with various signaling pathways, including the Akt kinase pathway, and is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and migration. It can interact with insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), preventing its binding to IGF-1R, which affects downstream signaling pathways such as Akt and ERK (Lenárt2020Trop2:). These interactions underscore TACSTD2's multifaceted role in cellular signaling and its potential impact on disease progression.
