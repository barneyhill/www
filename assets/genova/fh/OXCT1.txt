# OXCT1

## Overview
The OXCT1 gene encodes the enzyme 3-oxoacid CoA-transferase 1, also known as succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid CoA transferase (SCOT), which is a key player in ketone body metabolism. This enzyme is categorized as a CoA transferase and is primarily involved in the ketolysis pathway, facilitating the conversion of ketone bodies into usable energy forms in extrahepatic tissues such as the heart, brain, and kidneys. The SCOT enzyme operates within the mitochondrial matrix and is essential for energy homeostasis, especially during periods of low glucose availability, such as fasting. Mutations in the OXCT1 gene can lead to SCOT deficiency, a rare metabolic disorder characterized by impaired ketone body utilization and recurrent ketoacidosis (Grünert2021SuccinylCoA:3oxoacid; Alghamdi2021Clinical).

## Structure
The OXCT1 gene encodes the human Succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid CoA transferase (SCOT) enzyme, which plays a crucial role in ketone body metabolism. The primary structure of SCOT consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the OXCT1 gene. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to the enzyme's stability and function (Shafqat2013A).

The tertiary structure of SCOT forms a functional enzyme with specific domains, such as the CoA-binding domain, which is essential for its catalytic activity. The enzyme adopts an R/β protein fold, similar to bacterial CoA transferases, but with distinct loop structures near the active site that influence substrate specificity (Bateman2002Structure). The active site contains a crucial glutamate residue, Glu 305, which is vital for the enzyme's function (Bateman2002Structure).

In terms of quaternary structure, SCOT exists as a homodimer with two active sites, and a homotetrameric form has also been observed, although its physiological relevance is uncertain (Bateman2002Structure). The enzyme's structure is characterized by hydrophobic interactions and some hydrogen bonding at the monomer interfaces, contributing to its stability (Bateman2002Structure).

## Function
The OXCT1 gene encodes the enzyme succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid CoA transferase (SCOT), which plays a crucial role in the metabolic pathway of ketolysis. This enzyme is responsible for the transfer of the CoA moiety from succinyl-CoA to acetoacetate, resulting in the production of acetoacetyl-CoA. This process is essential for the utilization of ketone bodies as an energy source, particularly in extrahepatic tissues such as the heart, brain, and kidneys, especially during periods of low glucose availability, such as fasting (Grünert2021SuccinylCoA:3oxoacid; Alghamdi2021Clinical).

SCOT operates through a ping-pong mechanism, where each monomer of the enzyme binds succinyl-CoA to form an enzyme-CoA thioester intermediate, which is then attacked by acetoacetate to yield acetoacetyl-CoA. The enzyme is active in the mitochondrial matrix and functions as a homodimer, with its structure comprising an N-terminal and a C-terminal domain connected by a linker region (Grünert2021SuccinylCoA:3oxoacid).

The activity of SCOT is the rate-determining step in ketolysis, highlighting its importance in maintaining energy homeostasis during metabolic stress. A deficiency in this enzyme can lead to metabolic disorders such as recurrent ketoacidosis (Alghamdi2021Clinical).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the OXCT1 gene, which encodes the enzyme succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid CoA transferase (SCOT), lead to a rare metabolic disorder known as SCOT deficiency. This autosomal recessive condition is characterized by impaired ketone body utilization, resulting in episodic or permanent ketosis and life-threatening ketoacidosis, particularly during periods of fasting or illness (Shafqat2013A; Grünert2021SuccinylCoA:3oxoacid; Kim2019A). Patients with SCOT deficiency often experience severe metabolic acidosis, ketonuria, and symptoms such as vomiting, lethargy, and unconsciousness (Gedikbasi2023Clinical; Schwade2017When).

The clinical manifestations of SCOT deficiency vary depending on the specific mutations and the residual enzyme activity. Some patients may retain partial SCOT activity, which can influence the severity and frequency of ketoacidotic episodes (Fukao2011Clinical; Sasai2017Heterozygous). Genetic analysis has identified numerous mutations in the OXCT1 gene, including missense mutations and large deletions, which contribute to the disorder's genetic diversity (Grünert2021SuccinylCoA:3oxoacid; Kim2019A).

Diagnosis of SCOT deficiency typically involves enzyme activity assays and genetic testing to identify mutations in the OXCT1 gene. Management strategies focus on preventing metabolic crises through dietary modifications and careful monitoring during illness (Fukao2011Clinical; Sasai2017Heterozygous).
