# KIF18A

## Overview
KIF18A is a gene that encodes the kinesin family member 18A, a motor protein belonging to the kinesin-8 family. This protein plays a pivotal role in mitotic spindle dynamics and microtubule regulation, essential processes for accurate chromosome alignment and segregation during cell division. KIF18A is characterized by its ATP-dependent motor activity, which facilitates its plus-end-directed motility along microtubules, contributing to the stabilization of kinetochore-microtubule attachments and the reduction of chromosome oscillations (Locke2017Structural; Janssen2018Loss). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as protein phosphatase 1 and HURP, further underscore its critical function in mitosis (De2014The; Ye2011HURP). Dysregulation of KIF18A expression has been linked to various cancers, where it is often associated with poor prognosis and aggressive tumor characteristics, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Liu2023Comprehensive; Zhang2010Kif18A).

## Structure
The KIF18A protein is a member of the kinesin-8 family, characterized by its role in mitotic spindle dynamics and microtubule regulation. The primary structure of KIF18A includes a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain, with a motor domain responsible for ATP hydrolysis and microtubule binding (Locke2017Structural). This motor domain is highly conserved and includes specific subdomains such as the P-loop and Switch I/II, which are crucial for its function (Locke2017Structural).

The secondary structure of KIF18A features alpha-helices and beta-sheets, with helix-α6 playing a significant role in the protein's conformational changes during microtubule interactions (Locke2017Structural). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a three-dimensional configuration, essential for its motility and depolymerization activities (Locke2017Structural).

KIF18A may form homodimers, representing its quaternary structure, which is important for its function in microtubule dynamics (Locke2017Structural). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which regulate its activity (Zusev2008New). Splice variants of KIF18A exist, leading to isoforms with structural variations due to alternative splicing and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (Luboshits2005MSKIF18A).

## Function
KIF18A is a kinesin motor protein that plays a critical role in mitosis by regulating microtubule dynamics and ensuring proper chromosome alignment and segregation. It is involved in maintaining tension at kinetochores, which are structures on chromosomes that attach to microtubules during cell division. This tension is crucial for the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) to be silenced, allowing the cell to progress to anaphase (Janssen2018Loss). 

In healthy human cells, KIF18A localizes to the mitotic spindle and is essential for reducing chromosome oscillations and stabilizing kinetochore-microtubule (k-Mt) attachments. This stabilization is necessary for accurate chromosome segregation and prevents prolonged mitotic arrest due to SAC activation (Janssen2018Loss). Despite the absence of KIF18A leading to severe chromosome oscillations, cells can still maintain high fidelity in chromosome segregation, indicating effective kinetochore attachment to the mitotic spindle (Janssen2018Loss).

KIF18A's function is also linked to its ability to depolymerize microtubules, which is essential for maintaining proper spindle length and ensuring accurate chromosome positioning during cell division (Locke2017Structural). The protein's activity is ATP-dependent, and it exhibits plus-end-directed motility, which is crucial for its role in mitotic chromosome positioning (Locke2017Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the KIF18A gene have been implicated in the progression and prognosis of various cancers. Overexpression of KIF18A is observed in breast cancer, where it correlates with higher tumor grade, metastasis, and poor survival outcomes. Inhibition of KIF18A in breast cancer cells reduces proliferation and migration, suggesting its role in cancer progression (Kasahara2016Clinicopathological; Zhang2010Kif18A). In glioma, high KIF18A expression is associated with increased immune cell infiltration and worse overall survival, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Tao2022Prognostic). 

KIF18A is also overexpressed in liver and pancreatic cancers, where it serves as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival, linked to advanced clinical stages and poor outcomes (Liu2023Comprehensive). In hepatocellular carcinoma, KIF18A expression is associated with aggressive features such as larger tumor size and metastasis, and its knockdown reduces cell proliferation (Ren2024Kinesin). In cervical cancer, KIF18A promotes cancer progression through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, enhancing cell viability and invasiveness (Sun2024KIF18A). These findings suggest that KIF18A could be a potential target for therapeutic intervention across multiple cancer types.

## Interactions
KIF18A, a kinesin-8 family motor protein, interacts with several proteins that are crucial for its function in mitotic spindle dynamics and chromosome alignment. One significant interaction is with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which binds to KIF18A through a conserved RVxF motif. This interaction is essential for the regulation of KIF18A's activity during mitosis, particularly in chromosome congression and alignment (De2014The; Häfner2014Preanaphase). KIF18A is also involved in a regulatory mechanism with cyclin-dependent kinase-1 (Cdk1), where Cdk1 phosphorylates KIF18A, promoting chromosome oscillations, while PP1 dephosphorylates it, reducing these oscillations and aiding in proper chromosome alignment (Häfner2014Preanaphase).

KIF18A interacts with HURP, a protein that modulates its localization at the plus end of kinetochore microtubules. This interaction is crucial for chromosome congression, as HURP affects the dynamics and localization of KIF18A, impacting its function in mitotic spindle assembly (Ye2011HURP). Additionally, KIF18A's activity is regulated by Kinesin-binding protein (KBP), which inhibits its interaction with microtubules, thereby affecting spindle dynamics and chromosome segregation (Malaby2019Kinesinbinding). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory network involving KIF18A, essential for maintaining genomic stability during cell division.
