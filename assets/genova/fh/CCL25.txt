# CCL25

## Overview
CCL25, or C-C motif chemokine ligand 25, is a gene that encodes a chemokine protein involved in the regulation of immune cell migration, particularly within the thymus and small intestine. The protein product of CCL25 is a chemokine that plays a pivotal role in immune surveillance and mucosal immunity by guiding the migration of T cells through its interaction with the CCR9 receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor (Svensson2006Role; Campbell2002Intestinal). This interaction is crucial for the homing of lymphocytes to the intestinal epithelium and the development of thymocytes, thereby maintaining immune homeostasis. Beyond its physiological roles, the CCL25/CCR9 axis is implicated in various pathological conditions, including inflammatory diseases and cancers, where it influences cell migration, invasion, and the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (Johnson2010CCL25CCR9; Niu2020CCL25). Understanding the function and regulation of CCL25 is essential for developing therapeutic strategies targeting immune and cancer-related pathologies.

## Function
CCL25, also known as C-C motif chemokine ligand 25, is a chemokine involved in directing leukocyte migration, playing a crucial role in immune surveillance and maintaining mucosal immunity. It is primarily expressed in the thymus and small intestine, where it guides the migration of T cells by binding to its sole functional receptor, CCR9 (Svensson2006Role; Campbell2002Intestinal). In the small intestine, CCL25 is constitutively expressed by the crypt epithelium and is involved in the homing of effector CD8+ T cells to the intestinal epithelium, contributing to immune surveillance and response (Svensson2006Role; Campbell2002Intestinal).

CCL25 is also involved in the development of the small intestinal T-cell receptor-γδ T-cell compartment and plays a role in the recruitment of lymphocytes to the small intestine, particularly influencing the localization of mature lymphocytes to the small intestinal mucosa (Svensson2006Role). The CCL25/CCR9 interaction is essential for the adhesion and transmigration of lymphocytes into the intestinal epithelium, facilitating rapid adhesion in the vascular endothelium or transmigration into the lamina propria (Campbell2002Intestinal). This chemokine is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis in the small intestine by regulating the localization and function of various immune cells (Svensson2006Role).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CCL25 gene and its interactions with the CCR9 receptor have been implicated in various inflammatory diseases and cancers. In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly ulcerative colitis, the CCL25/CCR9 interaction is crucial for resolving inflammation in the large intestine. Studies have shown that blocking CCR9 can exacerbate symptoms, suggesting that therapies targeting this pathway should be approached with caution in IBD patients (Wurbel2011CCL25CCR9).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), high expression levels of CCL25 and CCR9 are associated with poor survival outcomes. The CCL25/CCR9 axis promotes cancer cell migration and invasion by regulating the expression of vascular endothelial growth factors and matrix metalloproteinases, which are critical for tumor progression (Niu2020CCL25).

In ovarian cancer, the CCL25-CCR9 interaction enhances cell migration and invasion, contributing to metastasis. This axis modulates the expression of matrix metalloproteinases, facilitating the breakdown of extracellular matrix components and promoting cancer cell invasion (Johnson2010CCL25CCR9).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of CCL25 in both inflammatory diseases and cancer, suggesting potential therapeutic targets for intervention.

## Interactions
CCL25 primarily interacts with its receptor CCR9, which is the sole signaling receptor for CCL25. This interaction is crucial for directing leukocyte migration, particularly in the development of thymocytes and intestinal lymphocytes (Svensson2006Role). CCL25 also binds to CCX-CKR, but this does not result in receptor signaling, suggesting that CCX-CKR functions as a decoy receptor (Svensson2006Role).

In the context of rheumatoid arthritis, CCL25 interacts with CCR9 on myeloid progenitor cells, transforming them into mature osteoclasts. This process is mediated by the upregulation of myeloid receptor activator of nuclear factor κ B (RANK) and Cathepsin K (CTSK) (Umar2021CCL25). CCL25 also induces phosphorylation of p38 and ERK, contributing to joint infiltration by fibroblast-like synoviocytes and monocytes, and the secretion of proangiogenic factors IL-8 and CCL2 (Umar2021CCL25).

In cancer, CCL25-CCR9 interactions are implicated in the migration and invasion of ovarian cancer cells, as well as the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) like MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-9, which are involved in extracellular matrix degradation and cancer cell dissemination (Johnson2010CCL25CCR9).
