# KRT26

## Overview
KRT26 is a gene that encodes the protein keratin 26, a type I cytokeratin, which is part of the keratin family of fibrous structural proteins. These proteins are essential components of the intermediate filaments that provide mechanical support and resilience to epithelial cells, particularly within the inner root sheath of hair follicles (Ho2022Update; Ehrlich2019Comparative). Keratin 26 is characterized by a central alpha-helical rod domain, flanked by non-helical head and tail domains, facilitating the formation of coiled-coil dimers and higher-order filamentous structures (Werner2020Epithelial). The protein is involved in epithelial cell differentiation and skin development, and it plays a role in the estrogen signaling pathway, which affects hair follicle structure and function (Huang2024Integration). The evolutionary conservation of KRT26 from Amphibia ancestors to mammals underscores its significance in adaptation to terrestrial environments (Ho2022Update).

## Structure
KRT26, or keratin 26, is a type I cytokeratin that is part of the keratin family of fibrous structural proteins. These proteins are integral components of the intermediate filaments that provide mechanical support to epithelial cells. The primary structure of KRT26 consists of a central alpha-helical rod domain, which is flanked by non-helical head and tail domains. This structure is typical of keratins, facilitating the formation of coiled-coil dimers, which are the building blocks for higher-order filamentous structures (Ho2022Update; Werner2020Epithelial).

The secondary structure of KRT26 involves the organization of the alpha-helical domains into a heptad repeat pattern, which is crucial for the coiled-coil dimeric formations. These dimers then assemble into antiparallel tetramers, forming the basis of the intermediate filament assembly (Werner2020Epithelial).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur in KRT26, influencing the assembly and disassembly of the filaments. These modifications are important for the dynamic regulation of the keratin filament network within cells (Werner2020Epithelial). The specific expression patterns and roles of KRT26 in various tissues are still being explored, with some studies noting its involvement in hair follicle structures (Ho2022Update).

## Function
KRT26 (keratin 26) is a type I cytokeratin that plays a significant role in the structural integrity of epithelial cells. It is primarily expressed in the inner root sheath of hair follicles, where it contributes to the formation of intermediate filaments, providing mechanical support and resilience to cells (Ehrlich2019Comparative). These intermediate filaments are crucial for maintaining the structural stability and function of epithelial tissues, particularly in the skin and hair follicles (Ho2022Update).

KRT26 is involved in processes such as epithelial cell differentiation and skin development. It is also implicated in the estrogen signaling pathway, which influences fiber structure and diameter in hair follicles (Huang2024Integration). The protein's role in these pathways suggests that it may be important for the regulation of hair growth and the maintenance of hair follicle structure.

The evolutionary history of KRT26 indicates that it evolved from type I keratins in Amphibia ancestors and has been conserved in mammals, highlighting its importance in adaptation to terrestrial environments (Ho2022Update). Despite its evolutionary significance, the specific function of KRT26 in healthy human cells remains less well-defined, but its involvement in structural and regulatory roles in hair follicles is evident.
