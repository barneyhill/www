# ATP6V1A

## Overview
The ATP6V1A gene encodes the A subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase), a multi-subunit enzyme complex that plays a pivotal role in the acidification of intracellular organelles in eukaryotic cells. This gene is crucial for various cellular processes, including protein degradation, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and neurotransmitter loading into synaptic vesicles. The protein product, ATPase H+ transporting V1 subunit A, is part of the V1 domain of the V-ATPase complex, which is responsible for ATP hydrolysis. As a component of the V-type proton ATPase, ATP6V1A is integral to maintaining the acidic environment necessary for the function of hydrolases within organelles such as lysosomes and autolysosomes (Cotter2015Recent; Alzamora2013AMPactivated). The activity of this protein is modulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which links its function to the cell's metabolic status (Alzamora2013AMPactivated). Mutations in ATP6V1A have been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Fassio2018De).

## Structure
The ATP6V1A gene encodes the A subunit of the V-type proton ATPase (V-ATPase), which is a crucial component of the V1 domain responsible for ATP hydrolysis. The primary structure of ATP6V1A consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that form the protein's backbone. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's overall stability and function (Fassio2018De).

The tertiary structure of ATP6V1A involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, allowing it to interact with other subunits within the V-ATPase complex. This folding is essential for its role in ATP hydrolysis and proton transport (Fassio2018De). The quaternary structure of ATP6V1A is characterized by its assembly with other subunits in the V1 domain, forming a hexameric configuration with subunits A and B, which contain nucleotide-binding sites for ATP hydrolysis (Chu2021The).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating ATP6V1A's function. For instance, phosphorylation at Ser-384 by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) modulates V-ATPase activity, affecting proton secretion and subcellular localization (Alzamora2013AMPactivated). The protein may also exist in different splice variant isoforms, contributing to its structural and functional diversity (Eaton2021The).

## Function
The ATP6V1A gene encodes the A subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase), a critical enzyme complex involved in the acidification of intracellular organelles in eukaryotic cells. This acidification is essential for various cellular processes, including protein degradation, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and neurotransmitter loading into synaptic vesicles (Cotter2015Recent; Alzamora2013AMPactivated). The V-ATPase is composed of two main domains: the cytosolic V1 domain, which includes the A subunit responsible for ATP hydrolysis, and the integral V0 domain, which facilitates proton transport across membranes (Cotter2015Recent).

In healthy human cells, V-ATPases are distributed on the cytoplasmic membrane and the membrane system of organelles such as lysosomes and autolysosomes. They play a significant role in maintaining the acidic environment necessary for the function of hydrolases within these organelles, which is crucial for the degradation of proteins and their intracellular transport and sorting (Wang2017Expression). The ATP6V1A subunit is particularly important in kidney intercalated cells, where it contributes to maintaining acid-base homeostasis by regulating proton secretion (Alzamora2013AMPactivated). The activity of V-ATPase is modulated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) through phosphorylation of the A subunit, linking its function to the cell's metabolic status (Alzamora2013AMPactivated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATP6V1A gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, primarily characterized by developmental encephalopathy with epilepsy. These mutations often result in severe developmental and epileptic conditions, with clinical manifestations including developmental delay, febrile seizures, hypotonic/dyskinetic quadriparesis, and various types of epilepsy (Fassio2018De). Specific de novo missense mutations, such as p.Asp100Tyr and p.Asp349Asn, have been identified as pathogenic, affecting lysosomal homeostasis and neuronal development. The p.Asp100Tyr mutation is associated with a loss-of-function mechanism, leading to increased ATPase degradation and lysosomal defects, while the p.Asp349Asn mutation results in a gain-of-function effect, causing increased acidification of intracellular organelles (Fassio2018De).

Patients with ATP6V1A mutations often exhibit a spectrum of symptoms, ranging from early lethal encephalopathies to milder forms with static intellectual disability and epilepsy. Common features include early hypotonia, microcephaly, and amelogenesis imperfecta, with brain MRI often showing hypomyelination and generalized atrophy (Guerrini2022Phenotypic). These mutations disrupt critical processes in neuronal development and synaptic connectivity, contributing to the observed phenotypes (Fassio2018De).

## Interactions
ATP6V1A, a subunit of the V1 domain of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) complex, participates in several important protein interactions. It interacts with αB-crystallin, a small heat shock protein, which helps in the lysosomal localization and stability of ATP6V1A. This interaction is crucial for preventing ATP6V1A degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Cui2020Heat). ATP6V1A also associates with the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which stabilizes ATP6V1A and regulates its interaction with αB-crystallin. The phosphorylation of ATP6V1A at serine 441 is important for these interactions (Cui2020Heat).

In the context of viral replication, ATP6V1A interacts with the rabies virus (RABV) matrix (M) protein, facilitating virion uncoating and promoting viral replication. This interaction is mediated by specific residues in ATP6V1A, such as lysine 256 and glutamic acid 279, which are critical for the dissociation of M proteins from nucleocapsids during viral uncoating (Liu2021The). These interactions highlight ATP6V1A's role in both cellular processes and viral pathogenesis.
