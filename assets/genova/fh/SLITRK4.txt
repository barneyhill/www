# SLITRK4

## Overview
SLITRK4 is a gene that encodes the protein SLIT and NTRK-like family member 4, which is part of the SLIT and NTRK-like family of proteins. This protein is characterized by its structural components, including tandem leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic region. SLITRK4 is primarily involved in synaptic adhesion and organization within the central nervous system, playing a crucial role in the development and maintenance of synapses, particularly excitatory ones, through interactions with receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) (Yamagata2019Structural; Kang2016Slitrk). Beyond its neural functions, SLITRK4 is also implicated in cancer progression, notably in gastric cancer, where it interacts with Canopy FGF Signalling Regulator 3 (CNPY3) to enhance TrkB-related signaling pathways (Zhou2023The). Mutations and dysregulation of SLITRK4 have been associated with various neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder, as well as certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both neurological and oncological contexts (Matsumoto2024Slitrk4; Kang2016Slitrk).

## Structure
SLITRK4 is a member of the SLIT and NTRK-like family of proteins, characterized by its structural components that include tandem leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, a single transmembrane domain, and a divergent cytoplasmic region. The extracellular domain of SLITRK4 consists of two LRR domains, LRR1 and LRR2, which are crucial for its role in synapse formation through interactions with receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) (Yamagata2019Structural; Kang2016Slitrk). These LRR domains are involved in protein-protein interactions, particularly with LAR-RPTPs, facilitating synaptic adhesion and organization (Um2014Structural).

The protein undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which are important for its surface expression and function (Kang2016Slitrk). Missense mutations, such as V206I and I578V, have been shown to impair SLITRK4's biochemical properties and synapse-promoting activity by affecting its surface transport and intracellular localization (Kang2016Slitrk). These mutations can lead to the protein being trapped intracellularly, particularly in the endoplasmic reticulum and cis-Golgi, disrupting its normal function (Kang2016Slitrk). Alternative splicing may result in different isoforms, potentially influencing the protein's function and localization (Won2019Synaptic).

## Function
SLITRK4 is a member of the Slitrk family, which consists of synaptic adhesion molecules involved in synapse formation in the central nervous system. These proteins play a crucial role in both excitatory and inhibitory synapse development by forming trans-synaptic adhesions with LAR receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) (Kang2016Slitrk). SLITRK4 is particularly implicated in organizing excitatory synapse development through interactions with PTPσ (Kang2016Slitrk). 

In healthy human cells, SLITRK4 is involved in synapse formation and maintenance, as evidenced by its ability to recruit synapsin clustering, which is essential for synapse formation (Kang2016Slitrk). The protein is enriched in the synaptosomal plasma membrane and postsynaptic density fractions, indicating its preferential distribution in excitatory postsynapses (Matsumoto2024Slitrk4). 

SLITRK4's role in synaptic processes is crucial for maintaining normal synaptic functions, and its dysfunction is associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. Mutations in SLITRK4 can impair its biochemical properties, leading to a loss of synapse-promoting activity and contributing to conditions such as schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorders (Kang2016Slitrk).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SLITRK4 gene have been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders and cancers. In the context of neuropsychiatric conditions, SLITRK4 is associated with disorders such as schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Specific missense mutations, including V206I and I578V, impair synapse formation and trafficking, potentially contributing to these disorders by disrupting normal synaptic function (Kang2016Slitrk). SLITRK4 is also linked to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and phobia-associated diseases, as it plays a role in suppressing fear-associated behaviors. Upregulation of SLITRK4 has been observed in the prefrontal cortices of PTSD patients and in the blood of military personnel with PTSD (Matsumoto2024Slitrk4).

In cancer, SLITRK4 expression is significantly increased in gastric cancer tissues with liver metastasis, correlating with poor clinical prognosis. The SLITRK4-CNPY3 axis enhances the endocytosis and recycling of the TrkB receptor, promoting tumorigenicity and metastasis in gastric cancer (Zhou2023The). SLITRK4 overexpression has also been noted in leiomyosarcoma and is identified as a causative gene in chronic myelocytic leukemia and hepatocellular carcinoma, suggesting its involvement in oncogenesis (Matsumoto2024Slitrk4).

## Interactions
SLITRK4, a member of the SLIT and NTRK-like family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence both neural development and cancer progression. In the context of gastric cancer, SLITRK4 interacts with Canopy FGF Signalling Regulator 3 (CNPY3), enhancing TrkB-related signaling by promoting the endocytosis and recycling of the TrkB receptor. This interaction is part of the SLITRK4-CNPY3 axis, which contributes to liver metastasis of gastric cancer through the TrkB-related signaling pathway (Zhou2023The). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments and bioinformatics predictions have identified CNPY3 as a SLITRK4-binding protein, and immunofluorescence staining has shown co-localization of SLITRK4 and CNPY3 in gastric cancer cells (Zhou2023The).

In the nervous system, SLITRK4 is known for its synaptogenic activities and interacts with protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor delta (PTPδ), a membrane-spanning protein essential for presynapse integrity. Mutations in SLITRK4 can impair its surface expression and binding to PTPδ, leading to a loss of synapse-inducing activity (Kang2016Slitrk). These interactions are crucial for the proper development of inhibitory neurons and synapse formation, particularly in the fear memory circuit of the lateral amygdala (Matsumoto2024Slitrk4).
