# C16orf96

## Overview
C16orf96 is a gene located on chromosome 16 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 16 open reading frame 96. This protein is currently uncharacterized, meaning its specific biological functions and mechanisms of action remain largely unknown. However, emerging research suggests that C16orf96 may play a role in cancer biology, particularly in sarcoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma. Studies have identified associations between C16orf96 and cancer risk, as well as its potential prognostic significance in certain cancer types (Ershov2023Uncharacterized; jones2017identification). Despite these findings, further investigation is required to fully understand the functional implications of C16orf96 and its encoded protein in cellular processes and disease pathogenesis.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
C16orf96 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of sarcoma, a type of cancer, through studies that identified a higher burden of nonsynonymous deleterious variants in sarcoma cases compared to controls. This suggests that C16orf96 may be a novel candidate risk gene for sarcoma, although its exact role in cancer pathogenesis remains to be fully understood (jones2017identification). The gene has also been associated with a significantly lower burden of regulatory variants in healthy controls compared to sarcoma cases, indicating its potential involvement in sarcoma risk (Jones2019Identification).

In pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), low expression levels of C16orf96 are associated with unfavorable disease-free survival and overall survival, highlighting its prognostic significance in these cancers (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Despite these associations, the clinical significance of C16orf96 in cancer remains largely unexplored, and further research is needed to elucidate its potential role in cancer development and progression (Ershov2023Uncharacterized; jones2017identification).
