# POLR2K

## Overview
The POLR2K gene encodes a protein subunit that is integral to the function of RNA polymerases I, II, and III, which are essential enzymes in the transcription process of converting DNA into RNA. This protein, known as RNA polymerase II, I, and III subunit K, is involved in the synthesis of various RNA molecules, including messenger RNA (mRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and transfer RNA (tRNA), which are crucial for protein synthesis and other cellular functions. POLR2K is categorized as a transcriptional subunit and plays a significant role in the assembly and function of the RNA polymerase complexes, contributing to the regulation of gene expression and maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Its activity is primarily localized in the cell nucleus, where it is involved in the initiation and regulation of transcription, as well as in posttranscriptional processes such as mRNA processing and spliceosome signaling (Yang2020Gene). The gene's expression and interactions have been linked to various cellular pathways and are of particular interest in cancer research due to its upregulation in certain malignancies, including bladder cancer (Yang2020Gene).

## Function
The POLR2K gene encodes a subunit of RNA polymerases I, II, and III, which are essential for the transcription of DNA into RNA in human cells. This subunit plays a critical role in synthesizing various types of RNA, including mRNA, rRNA, and tRNA, which are crucial for protein synthesis and other cellular processes (Yang2020Gene). In healthy human cells, POLR2K is involved in fundamental cellular processes such as transcription and RNA metabolism, contributing to the synthesis and processing of mRNA and other RNA molecules (Yang2020Gene).

POLR2K is active in the cell nucleus, where it participates in the assembly of the RNA polymerase III pre-initiation complex, essential for initiating transcription (Yang2020Gene). This gene is also implicated in mRNA processing, spliceosome signaling, and ribosome signaling, highlighting its role in posttranscriptional modulation and protein translation (Yang2020Gene). Through these activities, POLR2K supports normal transcriptional processes and cellular homeostasis, ensuring the proper expression of genes necessary for organismal development and function (Yang2020Gene).

## Clinical Significance
The POLR2K gene, encoding a subunit of RNA polymerases II, I, and III, has been implicated in various cancers, particularly bladder cancer (BLCA). In BLCA, POLR2K is overexpressed compared to normal tissues, and this overexpression is associated with poor survival outcomes, including overall and disease-free survival (Yang2020Gene). The gene is involved in a positive feedback loop with the transcription factor E2F1, contributing to malignant phenotypes in bladder cancer (Yang2020Gene). Genetic alterations in POLR2K, especially amplifications, are linked to chromosomal structure changes and may influence downstream signaling pathways, promoting carcinogenesis (Yang2020Gene).

In addition to bladder cancer, POLR2K is overexpressed in other cancers, such as breast and prostate cancer, although specific clinical implications of these alterations are less detailed (Muste2023Deregulations). The gene's involvement in networks related to spliceosome signaling, mRNA surveillance, ribosome signaling, and immune response regulation suggests its potential as a biomarker for early diagnosis and treatment in bladder cancer (Yang2020Gene). Further research is needed to explore POLR2K's role in liquid biopsy biomarkers and its detectability in such tests (Yang2020Gene).

## Interactions
POLR2K is a subunit of RNA polymerases I, II, and III, playing a crucial role in the transcription machinery by contributing to the synthesis of mRNA and various non-coding RNAs. In the context of bladder cancer, POLR2K is significantly upregulated and interacts with several genes and pathways. It is part of a biological interaction network that includes genes such as KDMSA, KMT2D, and INTS8, which are involved in RNA polymerase complexes and spliceosomal complexes, indicating its role in posttranscriptional gene expression processes (Yang2020Gene).

POLR2K also interacts with the E2F1 gene, where its knockdown leads to reduced E2F1 levels, causing G1 arrest in bladder cancer cells. This suggests a regulatory interaction where POLR2K modulates E2F1 expression, highlighting a positive correlation between their expressions in bladder cancer tissues (Yang2020Gene).

Additionally, POLR2K is associated with mitochondrial protein complexes, spliceosome complexes, and replication forks, indicating its involvement in mitochondrial gene expression and mRNA/ncRNA processing. It is linked to tumor immune escape pathways, including the I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB signaling and JAK-STAT signaling pathways, suggesting its role in immune response regulation (Yang2020Gene).
