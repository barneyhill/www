# TEKT3

## Overview
TEKT3 is a gene that encodes the protein tektin 3, which is a member of the tektin family of proteins. Tektin 3 plays a crucial role in the structural integrity and function of cilia and flagella, which are essential for cellular processes such as motility. The protein is particularly important in sperm cells, where it contributes to the stability of microtubules and is involved in maintaining sperm motility and structural integrity. TEKT3 is primarily expressed in the male germ lineage, with much lower expression levels in other tissues such as the brain, indicating its specialized role in reproductive functions (Weterman2009Copy; Nagdas2015Identification). The protein's interactions with other tektins and proteins, such as TEKTIP1, are vital for its function, and disruptions in these interactions can lead to significant clinical conditions, including primary ciliary dyskinesia (Geng2024Tektin; Nagdas2015Identification).

## Function
TEKT3 (tektin 3) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the structural integrity and function of cilia and flagella. The TEKT3 protein is a member of the tektin family, which is known for its role in forming filamentous structures that contribute to the stability of microtubules. These microtubules are essential for the movement of cilia and flagella, which are critical for various cellular processes, including sperm motility (Nagdas2015Identification).

In sperm cells, TEKT3 is localized in the mitochondria and outer dense fibers, playing a crucial role in maintaining sperm motility and structural integrity. TEKT3-null mice have been observed to exhibit reduced sperm motility and structural defects, highlighting its importance in reproductive success (Nagdas2015Identification). The protein is also associated with the acrosomal cap of sperm, where it may be involved in regulating hydrolases released during the acrosome reaction, a key event in fertilization (Nagdas2015Identification).

While TEKT3 is primarily expressed in the male germ lineage, it has much lower expression in the brain, suggesting a specialized role in spermatozoa transport rather than broader cellular functions (Weterman2009Copy).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the TEKT3 gene can significantly impact ciliary function, leading to various clinical conditions. TEKT3 encodes a protein crucial for the structural integrity of cilia and flagella. Disruptions in this gene can result in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a disorder characterized by impaired ciliary movement. This condition can lead to chronic respiratory tract infections, reduced fertility, and issues with organ positioning due to the role of cilia in embryonic development. The dysfunction of cilia in the respiratory tract can cause mucus buildup, leading to persistent cough and recurrent infections. In the reproductive system, defective flagella can result in male infertility due to impaired sperm motility. Additionally, the abnormal positioning of organs, known as situs inversus, can occur when ciliary function is compromised during embryogenesis. These clinical manifestations underscore the importance of TEKT3 in maintaining normal ciliary and flagellar function, and highlight the potential consequences of its genetic mutations or altered expression.

## Interactions
TEKT3, a member of the tektin family, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in sperm motility and structural integrity. In mouse sperm flagella, TEKT3 interacts specifically with TEKTIP1, a tektin bundle interacting protein. This interaction is essential for the organization and stability of tektin bundles and axonemes, as TEKTIP1 is required for the proper connection of TEKT3 with other tektins, such as TEKT1, TEKT2, and TEKT4 (Geng2024Tektin). The absence of TEKTIP1 leads to a reduction in TEKT3 high polymers and an increase in its oligomer expression, indicating a disruption in its organization (Geng2024Tektin).

In bovine sperm, TEKT3 is localized to the acrosomal cap and is suggested to act as a structural element in the acrosomal matrix. It interacts with acrosomal hydrolases, such as acrosin and N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAGA), with a stronger affinity for acrosin. This interaction is dependent on the glycosylation status of TEKT3, as deglycosylation reduces its binding efficiency (Nagdas2015Identification). These interactions highlight the role of TEKT3 in both structural and functional aspects of sperm cells.
