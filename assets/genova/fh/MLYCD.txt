# MLYCD

## Overview
The MLYCD gene encodes the enzyme malonyl-CoA decarboxylase, which is a critical component of fatty acid metabolism. This enzyme is responsible for the decarboxylation of malonyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA, a reaction that plays a significant role in regulating the levels of malonyl-CoA, a key substrate in fatty acid synthesis and an inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) (Rodriguez2014Chemicalgenetic). Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase is categorized as a decarboxylase enzyme and is predominantly localized in peroxisomes, with some presence in the cytoplasm and mitochondria (Wightman2003MLYCD). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining energy homeostasis and metabolic flexibility, particularly in tissues such as skeletal muscle, liver, and heart (Rodriguez2014Chemicalgenetic). Mutations in the MLYCD gene can lead to malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency, a rare metabolic disorder with a range of clinical manifestations (ChapelCrespo2019Clinical).

## Structure
The MLYCD protein is encoded by the MLYCD gene and plays a crucial role in fatty acid metabolism by catalyzing the decarboxylation of malonyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA. The primary structure of the MLYCD protein includes five exons and features three potential start codons, with only two believed to be functional (Wightman2003MLYCD). The protein is predicted to have an N-terminal mitochondrial-targeting sequence and a C-terminal peroxisomal-targeting sequence, although it is predominantly localized in peroxisomes with some presence in the cytoplasm (Wightman2003MLYCD).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation are suggested to influence the protein's molecular weight and electrophoretic mobility, potentially affecting its subcellular localization and enzyme activity (Wightman2003MLYCD). Mutations in the MLYCD gene can lead to mislocalization of the protein, impacting its function without altering its catalytic activity, highlighting the importance of correct localization for normal function (Wightman2003MLYCD). The presence of splice variant isoforms is indicated by the existence of a smaller isoform with only the peroxisomal-targeting signal in certain species, although in mammals, this smaller isoform is thought to result from intracellular processing (Wightman2003MLYCD).

## Function
Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MLYCD) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in fatty acid metabolism by catalyzing the decarboxylation of malonyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA and carbon dioxide. This reaction is essential for regulating the levels of malonyl-CoA, a key substrate in fatty acid synthesis and an inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), which is involved in mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation (Rodriguez2014Chemicalgenetic). By reducing malonyl-CoA levels, MLYCD facilitates the oxidation of long-chain fatty acids, thereby contributing to energy homeostasis and metabolic flexibility in cells (Rodriguez2014Chemicalgenetic).

In skeletal muscle, MLYCD activity is crucial for enhancing fatty acid oxidation, which is important for maintaining lipid balance and preventing the accumulation of lipid intermediates that can impair insulin signaling (Rodriguez2014Chemicalgenetic). The enzyme is active in both the mitochondria and cytosol, influencing lipid biosynthesis and oxidation processes (Rodriguez2014Chemicalgenetic). While MLYCD overexpression in the liver has been shown to improve insulin resistance by increasing fatty acid oxidation, its effects in skeletal muscle are complex and may not always lead to improved metabolic outcomes (Rodriguez2014Chemicalgenetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MLYCD gene lead to malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency (MLYCDD), a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder. This condition is characterized by the accumulation of malonyl-CoA, which disrupts fatty acid metabolism and can result in a variety of symptoms, including developmental delay, seizures, hypotonia, metabolic acidosis, hypoglycemia, ketosis, and cardiomyopathy (Polinati2015MalonylCoA; ChapelCrespo2019Clinical). The deficiency can also lead to elevated levels of malonic acid and malonylcarnitine in the body, which are used as diagnostic markers (DEWIT2006Brain).

The clinical presentation of MLYCDD is variable, with some patients experiencing severe symptoms such as cardiomyopathy and brain abnormalities, while others may be asymptomatic at diagnosis (Polinati2015MalonylCoA; ChapelCrespo2019Clinical). Mutations in the MLYCD gene can result in protein mislocalization, affecting its function and contributing to disease pathology (Polinati2015MalonylCoA). Treatment options are limited, but dietary modifications and medications can help manage symptoms, particularly cardiomyopathy (Prada2012Malonyl). The natural history and long-term outcomes of MLYCDD remain poorly understood due to the rarity of the condition (ChapelCrespo2019Clinical).

## Interactions
Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MLYCD) is involved in several interactions that regulate metabolic pathways. One of the key interactions is with carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), where malonyl-CoA, the substrate of MLYCD, acts as an allosteric inhibitor. This inhibition prevents the transfer of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria, thereby regulating mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, which is crucial for energy metabolism in tissues such as skeletal muscle, liver, and heart (Polinati2015MalonylCoA; Kasapkara2021Malonyl).

MLYCD's role in brain development is also linked to its interaction with the inner mitochondrial membrane enzyme CPT2. This interaction is associated with cortical defects, suggesting that malonyl-CoA levels could influence the interaction between CPT1 and CPT2, potentially affecting brain development (DEWIT2006Brain).

The subcellular localization of MLYCD is crucial for its function, as mutations leading to protein mistargeting can result in severe phenotypes. These mutations affect the mitochondrial targeting sequence, disrupting proper protein folding and localization, which may contribute to the pathology of MLYCD-related disorders (Wightman2003MLYCD; Polinati2015MalonylCoA).
