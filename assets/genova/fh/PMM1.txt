# PMM1

## Overview
Phosphomannomutase 1 (PMM1) is a gene that encodes the enzyme phosphomannomutase 1, a member of the haloalkanoic acid dehalogenase superfamily (HADSF). This enzyme is primarily involved in mannose metabolism, catalyzing the interconversion of mannose-6-phosphate and mannose-1-phosphate, which is a critical step in the biosynthesis of GDP-mannose. GDP-mannose is essential for glycosylation processes, which are crucial for the production of glycoproteins and glycolipids in human cells (Quental2010Evolutionary; Matthijs1997PMM). Structurally, PMM1 is characterized by a core Rossmann fold and a cap domain, forming a homodimer in solution, which is vital for its enzymatic function (Silvaggi2006The). The enzyme also exhibits glucose-1,6-bisphosphatase activity, particularly in the brain under ischemic conditions, suggesting a role in energy metabolism (Ji2018Structural). Despite its significant biochemical roles, PMM1 has not been associated with any human diseases, and its knockout in mice does not result in an abnormal phenotype, indicating its non-essential role in normal development (Cromphout2006The).

## Structure
Phosphomannomutase 1 (PMM1) is a member of the haloalkanoic acid dehalogenase superfamily (HADSF) and is characterized by a core Rossmann fold and a separate cap domain. The enzyme's structure includes a core domain and a cap domain, with the cap domain responsible for binding the phosphorylated substrate, α-D-mannose 1-phosphate (Silvaggi2006The; Ji2018Structural). The cap domain opens to bind the substrate and closes to create a solvent-exclusive environment for catalysis (Silvaggi2006The). 

PMM1 forms a homodimer in solution, with the dimer interface consisting of interactions between the cap domains. This interface is characterized by a helix-helix interaction and an antiparallel β-sheet interaction, creating an extended eight-stranded β-sheet across the two monomers (Silvaggi2006The). The active site of PMM1 is located at the interface of the cap and core domains, with key residues including the catalytic nucleophile Asp 19, the putative acid/base residue Asp 21, and the metal-binding residue Asp 218 (Silvaggi2006The).

The enzyme's mechanism involves a two-step reaction with a bisphosphorylated sugar intermediate, similar to the functionally related enzyme β-phosphoglucomutase (Ji2018Structural). PMM1 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
Phosphomannomutase 1 (PMM1) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in mannose metabolism by catalyzing the conversion of mannose-6-phosphate to mannose-1-phosphate, a key step in the synthesis of GDP-mannose. GDP-mannose is essential for glycosylation processes, which are vital for the production of glycoproteins and glycolipids in human cells (Quental2010Evolutionary; Matthijs1997PMM). PMM1 is primarily expressed in the brain, where it also functions as a glucose-1,6-bisphosphatase, particularly under ischemic conditions. This activity is stimulated by inosine monophosphate (IMP) and is important for the degradation of glucose-1,6-bisphosphate, a cofactor in sugar phosphomutases and a modulator of glycolytic enzymes, suggesting a role in brain energy metabolism (Quental2010Evolutionary; Ji2018Structural).

PMM1 is also involved in phosphoryl transfer reactions, functioning as both a phosphatase and a mutase. It facilitates the conversion of glucose-1,6-bisphosphate or mannose-1,6-bisphosphate to their respective monophosphorylated forms, with its activity modulated by IMP (Ji2018Structural). Despite its significant role in these molecular processes, PMM1 has not been linked to any human disease, and its knockout in mice does not result in an abnormal phenotype, indicating its non-essential role in normal development (Cromphout2006The).

## Interactions
Phosphomannomutase 1 (PMM1) is known to interact with inosine monophosphate (IMP), which plays a significant role in modulating its enzymatic activities. IMP binding enhances PMM1's phosphatase activity while inhibiting its mutase function. This interaction is facilitated by specific residues in PMM1, such as Arg180 and Arg183, which are crucial for IMP binding. Mutations in these residues, such as the R180T/R183I variant, result in a significant reduction in IMP binding and phosphatase activity, highlighting the importance of these interactions (Ji2018Structural).

PMM1 also forms a homodimer, with the dimer interface stabilized by interactions between the cap domains, including helix-helix and antiparallel β-sheet interactions. This dimerization is essential for its structural stability and function (Silvaggi2006The). The enzyme's active site, located at the interface of the cap and core domains, involves key residues such as Asp19 and Asp218, which are critical for its catalytic function (Silvaggi2006The).

Additionally, PMM1's interaction with clodronate, a specific inhibitor, affects both its phosphoglucomutase and phosphatase activities, indicating a regulatory interaction that influences its enzymatic functions (Citro2017A).
