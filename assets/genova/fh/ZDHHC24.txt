# ZDHHC24

## Overview
ZDHHC24 is a gene that encodes the protein zinc finger DHHC-type containing 24, which is a member of the DHHC family of palmitoyl acyltransferases. This protein is primarily involved in the post-translational modification process known as palmitoylation, where it facilitates the attachment of palmitate, a fatty acid, to specific cysteine residues on target proteins. This modification is essential for regulating protein localization, stability, and function, particularly within the Golgi apparatus, where ZDHHC24 is predominantly active (Wild2023CellPalmSeq:). The protein plays a critical role in cellular signaling and membrane dynamics, influencing processes such as protein trafficking and signal transduction (Liao2024The). ZDHHC24's activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper protein function, with implications in various diseases, including cancer and liver disorders (Bu2024Highfat).

## Function
ZDHHC24 is a gene encoding a protein involved in the post-translational modification process known as palmitoylation, where fatty acid chains are added to cysteine residues on proteins. This modification is crucial for protein localization, stability, and function. ZDHHC24 is primarily active in the Golgi apparatus and plays a significant role in cellular signaling and membrane dynamics (Wild2023CellPalmSeq:).

In healthy human cells, ZDHHC24 is part of a family of 24 human ZDHHC enzymes that share a 'DHHC' catalytic motif, which is essential for their enzymatic activity (Wild2023CellPalmSeq:). These enzymes are involved in the reversible attachment of palmitate to proteins, a process that influences various cellular functions, including protein trafficking and signal transduction (Liao2024The). The palmitoylation process mediated by ZDHHC24 is crucial for maintaining the functional state of proteins, such as AKT, by enhancing their binding to PIP3 and promoting their membrane localization, which is important for their activation (Bu2024Highfat).

While the specific function of ZDHHC24 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its role in palmitoylation suggests it is integral to maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper protein function (Wild2023CellPalmSeq:).

## Clinical Significance
ZDHHC24 has been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), high transcriptional levels of ZDHHC24 are associated with shorter overall survival, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker. The expression of ZDHHC24 in LUAD is correlated with clinical characteristics such as sex, lymph node metastasis, and pathological stage. Additionally, increased promoter methylation of ZDHHC24 is observed in LUAD compared to normal lung tissue, with a negative correlation between methylation and expression levels (Bian2024Identification).

In the context of liver diseases, ZDHHC24 plays a role in liver tumorigenesis, particularly under a high-fat diet. It is involved in the palmitoylation and activation of the AKT protein, a process crucial for the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Amplification of ZDHHC24 can lead to increased AKT activation, promoting liver tumorigenesis. Targeting ZDHHC24 to inhibit AKT palmitoylation is being explored as a therapeutic strategy to reduce tumor growth in HCC (Bu2024Highfat).

These findings suggest that alterations in ZDHHC24 expression and function can significantly impact cancer progression and patient prognosis.
