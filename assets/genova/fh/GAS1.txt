# GAS1

## Overview
The GAS1 gene encodes the growth arrest specific 1 protein, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein that plays a pivotal role in regulating cell growth and development. This protein is primarily involved in cell cycle arrest, particularly by inhibiting the transition from the G0 to the S phase, thereby contributing to growth arrest in a p53-dependent manner (Del1995Gas1Induced). GAS1 is also a key player in the Hedgehog signaling pathway, where it enhances signaling activity by interacting with Patched1, thus influencing cell fate determination during development (C.2007Gas1). Additionally, GAS1 interacts with various proteins, including the RET receptor and amyloid-β precursor protein, modulating intracellular signaling and protein processing (Rosti2015Solution; Chapuis2011Growth). Clinically, alterations in GAS1 expression are linked to diseases such as colorectal cancer and developmental defects in the gastrointestinal tract, highlighting its significance as a tumor suppressor and developmental regulator (Li2016Gas1; Biau2012Gastrointestinal).

## Structure
The GAS1 protein is a multifunctional protein involved in cell cycle arrest, embryonic development, and tumor suppression. The mature human GAS1 protein consists of 345 amino acids and includes a potential signal peptide. It features a single N-glycosylation site at Asn117 and an aminated Ser318, which allows it to be glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored to the cell membrane (Rosti2015Solution). Structurally, GAS1 is a monomer in solution, as confirmed by size exclusion chromatography and multi-angle light scattering, with a molecular mass of approximately 31-33 kDa (Rosti2015Solution).

The secondary structure of GAS1 is predominantly α-helical, interspersed with short β-strands, and includes a long unstructured C-terminal domain (Rosti2015Solution). The protein is characterized by two GFRα-like domains, each containing 10 conserved disulfide bridge-forming cysteines, contributing to its stability (Rosti2015Solution). GAS1's tertiary structure is flexible, with the N- and C-terminal domains acting as independent units, and it exists in two conformations: extended and collapsed (Rosti2015Solution). Despite structural similarities to GFRαs, GAS1 lacks the amino acids necessary for neurotrophic factor binding, reflecting its distinct functional roles (Rosti2015Solution). No quaternary structure or oligomerization has been detected (Rosti2015Solution).

## Function
The GAS1 (growth arrest specific 1) gene encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein that plays a crucial role in regulating cell growth and development. In healthy human cells, GAS1 is primarily involved in inhibiting cell cycle progression, particularly by blocking the transition from the G0 to the S phase, thereby contributing to growth arrest. This function is mediated in a p53-dependent manner, although it does not require the transactivation function of p53, suggesting involvement of other p53-related functions, possibly related to apoptosis regulation (Del1995Gas1Induced).

GAS1 is a membrane-associated protein that is downregulated during the G0-to-S phase transition in serum-stimulated cells. It is not expressed in growing or transformed cells but is active in quiescent cells, where it helps maintain cell cycle arrest (Del1995Gas1Induced). GAS1 also plays a role in the Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway, where it enhances signaling activity by cooperating with Patched1 (PTC1) for Hedgehog binding. This function is significant for specifying cell fates during development, as GAS1 helps transform the Hedgehog protein gradient into an activity gradient (C.2007Gas1). Additionally, GAS1 expression is modulated by specific epigenetic marks and chromatin remodeling, which influence its role in maintaining quiescence and regulating cell proliferation (Sacilotto2011Epigenetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the GAS1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of colorectal cancer, GAS1 acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting metastatic and metabolic phenotypes. It negatively regulates aerobic glycolysis and the AMPK/mTOR/p70S6K signaling axis, which are crucial for cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. Low expression of GAS1 is associated with advanced tumor stages and metastasis, making it a potential prognostic biomarker for colorectal cancer (Li2016Gas1).

GAS1 is also involved in the development of the enteric nervous system through its role as a receptor for Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling. Mutations in GAS1 can lead to defects in axon projection, potentially contributing to conditions like Hirschsprung's disease, characterized by deficiencies in enteric neurons (Jin2014Gas1).

In the gastrointestinal tract, GAS1 mutations result in developmental defects such as reduced tract length and abnormal enteric neuron distribution. These defects are linked to dysregulated Hedgehog and Ret signaling pathways, which are crucial for proper gastrointestinal development (Biau2012Gastrointestinal).

## Interactions
GAS1 (growth arrest specific 1) is involved in several physical interactions with other proteins, primarily through its role in signaling pathways. GAS1 interacts with the Rearranged during transformation (RET) receptor, binding to its extracellular part in a neurotrophic factor-independent manner. This interaction is characterized by a dissociation constant (K_d) of 12.2 μM, indicating a direct but relatively low-affinity interaction. GAS1 binding to RET blocks AKT activation and increases ERK activation, suggesting a role in modulating RET's intracellular signaling (Rosti2015Solution).

GAS1 also interacts with the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway. It enhances SHH signaling by increasing the binding of Hedgehog (HH) to Patched1 (PTC1), acting synergistically with PTC1 to facilitate HH signaling. This interaction is crucial for development and is demonstrated by GAS1's ability to enhance HH signaling in the chick neural tube (Martinelli2007Gas1extends).

Additionally, GAS1 interacts with the amyloid-β precursor protein (APP), influencing its maturation and processing. GAS1 negatively controls APP trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, affecting APP's processing by secretases and reducing amyloid-β production (Chapuis2011Growth).
