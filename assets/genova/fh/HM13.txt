# HM13

## Overview
HM13 is a gene that encodes the protein histocompatibility minor 13, also known as signal peptide peptidase (SPP), which is a type of intramembrane protease. This protein is integral to the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, where it plays a pivotal role in the processing and degradation of misfolded proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum. By facilitating the release of leader peptide remnants from the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, HM13 ensures proper protein quality control and cellular homeostasis (Wei2017Signal). The gene's expression and function are critical in various cellular processes, including signaling pathways and metabolic functions, and it has been implicated in several disease states, such as cancer and viral infections, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions (Liu2022Pancancer; Zhang2022Identification).

## Structure


## Function
HM13, also known as histocompatibility minor 13, encodes a protein that functions as an intramembrane protease involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. This protein plays a crucial role in processing and degrading misfolded proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum, which is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis and cellular function (Wei2017Signal). The HM13 protein, also referred to as signal peptide peptidase (SPP), is responsible for the release of leader peptide remnants from the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, a process vital for the proper functioning of cellular protein management systems (Wei2017Signal).

In healthy human cells, HM13's activity is critical for the regulation of protein quality control, ensuring that only properly folded proteins are transported to their intended cellular destinations. This function is fundamental to maintaining cellular health and preventing the accumulation of potentially toxic misfolded proteins. The precise regulation of protein degradation by HM13 is necessary for various cellular processes, including signaling pathways and metabolic functions, highlighting its importance in overall cellular and organismal homeostasis (Wei2017Signal).

## Clinical Significance
The HM13 gene, encoding signal peptide peptidase, is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In glioblastoma, HM13 is upregulated in high-grade gliomas compared to low-grade gliomas, correlating with decreased survival rates. Its overexpression in EGFRvIII samples suggests a role in tumor progression by affecting cytokine secretion profiles, which are crucial for tumorigenic abilities (Wei2017Signal).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), HM13 is significantly overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis. It promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and its expression is linked to immune cell infiltration, negatively correlating with T and B cells while positively correlating with macrophages. This interaction with the immune microenvironment may contribute to poor outcomes in HCC patients (Liu2022Pancancer; Zhang2022Identification). HM13 expression also correlates with immune checkpoint genes, suggesting potential implications for immunotherapy response (Zhang2022Identification).

HM13 is overexpressed in several other tumor types, including breast, kidney, lung, and colon cancers, where high expression is linked to worse survival outcomes. Its expression is also negatively correlated with drug sensitivity, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Liu2022Pancancer).

## Interactions
The HM13 gene encodes a signal peptide peptidase that is involved in various protein interactions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), HM13 is associated with the proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells. The GeneMANIA tool has identified potential interactions of HM13 with proteins such as SPPL3, SPPL2C, SPPL2A, and SPPL2B, forming a protein-protein interaction network. These interactions suggest that HM13 may play a role in complex cellular processes related to cancer progression (Liu2022Pancancer).

In the context of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, HM13 has been identified as a cellular peptidase that, when silenced, moderately impacts HCV infectious titers. This suggests that HM13 may have a supportive role in the HCV life cycle, although its exact interactions with viral or host proteins remain to be fully elucidated (Gottwein2007Hepatitis).

Overall, HM13's interactions with other proteins are crucial for its role in both normal cellular functions and disease states, including cancer and viral infections. These interactions highlight its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in diseases where HM13 is implicated.
