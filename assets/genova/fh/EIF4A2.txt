# EIF4A2

## Overview
EIF4A2 is a gene that encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A2, a member of the DEAD-box RNA helicase family. This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of mRNA translation, particularly in the context of miRNA-mediated translational repression and mRNA destabilization. EIF4A2 is distinct from its paralog EIF4A1, as it is specifically involved in miRNA repression pathways and is not functionally redundant (Wilczynska2019eIF4A2). The protein interacts with the Ccr4-Not complex, a key effector in translational repression, and binds to purine-rich motifs in the 5′ untranslated regions of target mRNAs, influencing ribosome occupancy and translation initiation (Wilczynska2019eIF4A2). Clinically, EIF4A2 is significant in various cancers, including colorectal cancer, where its expression correlates with poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy (Chen2019Eukaryotic).

## Function
EIF4A2, a member of the DEAD-box RNA helicase family, plays a significant role in the regulation of mRNA translation in healthy human cells. It is involved in miRNA-mediated translational repression and mRNA destabilization, primarily through its interaction with the Ccr4-Not complex. This complex is a principal effector of translational repression and mRNA degradation induced by miRNAs (Meijer2013Translational; Wilczynska2019eIF4A2). EIF4A2 binds to purine-rich motifs in the 5′ untranslated regions (5′UTRs) of target mRNAs, which are located near the AUG start codon, and this binding is associated with increased ribosome occupancy and potential activation of upstream open reading frames (uORFs) (Wilczynska2019eIF4A2).

Unlike its paralog EIF4A1, EIF4A2 is not functionally redundant and has distinct activities, particularly in miRNA-mediated repression pathways (Wilczynska2019eIF4A2). It is specifically recruited to miRNA-targeted mRNAs and associates with components of the miRNA repression machinery, playing a critical role early in the miRNA repression pathway (Meijer2013Translational). EIF4A2's activity is crucial for the repression of translation initiation, impacting gene expression and cellular function (Wilczynska2019eIF4A2).

## Clinical Significance
EIF4A2 is clinically significant in colorectal cancer (CRC) due to its role in promoting metastasis and resistance to chemotherapy, particularly oxaliplatin. High expression of EIF4A2 in CRC tissues is associated with poor prognosis, including shorter overall survival, disease-free survival, and progression-free survival. It is also linked to more advanced TNM stages and increased distant metastasis (Chen2019Eukaryotic). EIF4A2 acts as an independent predictor of survival outcomes in CRC patients (Chen2019Eukaryotic).

Knockdown of EIF4A2 in CRC cell lines has been shown to inhibit cell migration, invasion, and sphere formation, while also reducing the expression of stemness-associated genes and drug-resistant transporter genes. This suggests that EIF4A2 contributes to cancer progression and resistance (Chen2019Eukaryotic). The transcription of EIF4A2 is regulated by the transcription factor ZNF143, which is more highly expressed in tumors than in normal tissues, indicating a regulatory relationship that may influence cancer progression (Chen2019Eukaryotic).

EIF4A2 is also implicated in poor outcomes in other cancers, such as liver cancer, head and neck cancer, melanoma, and prostate cancer, highlighting its broader clinical significance (Chen2019Eukaryotic).

## Interactions
EIF4A2 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in translational repression. It forms an endogenous complex with CNOT1, a central component of the Ccr4-Not complex, and other components like CNOT7. This interaction is RNA-independent and distinct from its paralog eIF4A1, which shows a stronger association with eIF4G (Wilczynska2019eIF4A2). EIF4A2 is involved in miRNA-mediated repression, binding to mRNAs enriched with purine-rich motifs in the 5′ untranslated region (UTR), which leads to repression at the translation initiation stage (Wilczynska2019eIF4A2). 

The protein also interacts with TRIM32, CSNK1A1, CLP1, and TNKS1BP1, which are involved in mRNA turnover and miRNA-mediated repression (Wilczynska2019eIF4A2). EIF4A2's binding to mRNAs is selective and has high affinity for purine-rich sequences, similar to the binding of eIF4A1 when inhibited by silvestrol (Wilczynska2019eIF4A2). It is suggested that eIF4A2-bound mRNAs are targeted to sites of mRNA storage, such as P bodies (Wilczynska2019eIF4A2). The interaction with the Ccr4-Not complex is crucial for its role in translational repression, as depletion of CNOT1 leads to the redistribution of eIF4A2-bound mRNAs onto polysomes, indicating a release from repression (Wilczynska2019eIF4A2).
