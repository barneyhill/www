# PRMT3

## Overview
PRMT3 is a gene that encodes the protein arginine methyltransferase 3, a type I protein arginine methyltransferase. This enzyme is primarily located in the cytoplasm and is involved in the post-translational modification of proteins through the methylation of arginine residues. The protein plays a critical role in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, RNA processing, and ribosomal biogenesis, by methylating specific target proteins such as the 40S ribosomal protein S2. PRMT3's activity is modulated by its zinc-finger domain, which is essential for substrate specificity. The protein also interacts with several other proteins, influencing cellular functions and processes. Clinically, PRMT3 has been implicated in cancer progression and chemoresistance, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Kaniskan2015A; Frankel2000PRMT3; Shi2023PRMT3mediated; Guo2013Profiling).

## Structure
PRMT3 is a protein arginine methyltransferase characterized by a distinct molecular structure that includes a catalytic core with a two-domain architecture. The primary structure of PRMT3 consists of a core region of approximately 310 amino acids, which is highly conserved across eukaryotes (Zhang2000Crystal). The secondary structure features a Rossmann fold within the AdoMet-binding domain, which is a compact version of the consensus AdoMet-dependent methyltransferase fold (Zhang2000Crystal). This domain is involved in cofactor binding, interacting with AdoHcy through specific residues (Zhang2000Crystal).

The tertiary structure of PRMT3 includes a barrel-like domain formed by the C-terminal part of the protein, with a three-helix segment inserted between strands b6 and b7. This segment contributes to dimer formation through hydrophobic interactions (Zhang2000Crystal). The active site is located in a cone-shaped pocket between the AdoMet-binding domain and the barrel-like domain, featuring conserved residues such as a double-E loop and a histidine-aspartate proton-relay system (Zhang2000Crystal).

PRMT3 can form dimers, as suggested by crystal packing and solution behavior, which may influence its enzymatic activity and substrate access (Zhang2000Crystal). The protein may also exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, potentially affecting its structure and function.

## Function
Protein arginine methyltransferase 3 (PRMT3) is a type I PRMT that primarily functions in the cytoplasm, where it catalyzes the mono- and asymmetric dimethylation of arginine residues on target proteins. This post-translational modification is crucial for various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, RNA processing, DNA repair, and signal transduction (Kaniskan2015A; Guo2013Profiling). PRMT3 is notably involved in ribosomal biogenesis, as it methylates the 40S ribosomal protein S2 (rpS2), which is essential for the maturation of the 80S ribosome and proper protein synthesis (Kaniskan2015A; Bachand2007Protein).

PRMT3 also interacts with the tumor suppressor DAL-1/4.1B, inhibiting its enzymatic activity, which suggests a role in tumor suppression (Guo2013Profiling). In addition to its cytoplasmic functions, PRMT3 has been shown to co-localize with liver X receptor alpha (LXRa) in the nucleus, where it regulates hepatic lipogenesis independently of its methyltransferase activity (Kaniskan2015A). The enzyme's activity is modulated by its zinc-finger domain, which is crucial for substrate specificity, particularly for RNA-associated proteins (Frankel2000PRMT3). PRMT3's diverse roles in cellular processes underscore its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of PRMT3 have been implicated in various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and pancreatic cancer. In HCC, PRMT3 overexpression is associated with resistance to oxaliplatin (OXA), a chemotherapeutic agent. This resistance is mediated through the PRMT3-IGF2BP1-HEG1 axis, where PRMT3 methylates IGF2BP1, stabilizing HEG1 mRNA and promoting drug resistance. High PRMT3 expression correlates with poor clinical outcomes and reduced responses to OXA-based hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) (Shi2023PRMT3mediated).

In pancreatic cancer, PRMT3 contributes to gemcitabine (GEM) resistance by upregulating the expression of ABCG2, a drug efflux pump. This upregulation occurs through increased mRNA stability facilitated by PRMT3's interaction with hnRNP A1, which is methylated by PRMT3. Inhibition of PRMT3 has been shown to reduce ABCG2 expression and increase sensitivity to GEM, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for overcoming chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer (Hsu2018Protein).

PRMT3 also interacts with the tumor suppressor DAL-1/4.1B, inhibiting its methyltransferase activity, which may play a role in tumor suppression (Singh2004DAL14.1B). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PRMT3 in cancer progression and treatment resistance.

## Interactions
PRMT3 interacts with several proteins, influencing various cellular processes. It forms a complex with the tumor suppressor DAL-1/4.1B, which inhibits PRMT3's methylation activity. This interaction is specific to the catalytic C-terminal core region of PRMT3 and does not involve the N-terminal zinc-finger domain (Singh2004DAL14.1B). PRMT3 also interacts with ALDH1A1, inhibiting its enzymatic activity and affecting retinoic acid signaling. This interaction is independent of PRMT3's methyltransferase activity and involves key residues such as His464, Asn465, Arg466, and Val468 (Verma2021PRMT3).

PRMT3 is known to form homo-oligomers and hetero-oligomers with PRMT1, as demonstrated through yeast two-hybrid interaction analysis (Tang1998PRMT). It also interacts with the 40S ribosomal protein uS5, forming mutually exclusive complexes with ZNF277. Overexpression of PRMT3 limits uS5's association with ZNF277, suggesting a competitive interaction (Dionne2019The). These interactions highlight PRMT3's role in regulating protein function and cellular processes through complex formation and inhibition of enzymatic activities.
