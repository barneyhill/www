# PRNP

## Overview
The PRNP gene encodes the prion protein (PrP), a glycoprotein predominantly expressed in the central nervous system and involved in various cellular processes. PrP is a cell surface protein anchored by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) moiety and is characterized by a structured C-terminal domain with three α-helices and two β-strands, contributing to its globular conformation (Wüthrich2001Threedimensional; Zahn2000NMR). Functionally, PrP is implicated in neuronal survival, synaptic transmission, and immune responses, acting as a signaling receptor and interacting with multiple cellular partners (Hu2008Prion; Roucou2004Cellular). The protein's ability to bind metal ions, such as copper, suggests a role in antioxidant defense (Roucou2004Cellular). Pathologically, mutations in PRNP are linked to prion diseases, a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the accumulation of misfolded prion proteins, leading to severe neurological impairment (Takada2016Genetic; Bernardi2019Mutations).

## Structure
The PRNP gene encodes the prion protein (PrP), which is primarily composed of a flexible N-terminal domain and a structured C-terminal domain. The C-terminal domain features three α-helices and two short β-strands, forming a globular structure. Specifically, the human prion protein (hPrP) has a globular domain from residues 125-228, with α-helix 1 spanning residues 144-154, α-helix 2 from 173-194, and α-helix 3 from 200-228. The β-strands are located at residues 128-131 and 161-164 (Zahn2000NMR). 

The prion protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation at specific sites and the addition of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, which facilitates its attachment to the plasma membrane (Wüthrich2001Threedimensional). The protein's structure is stabilized by a disulfide bond between Cys179 and Cys214 (Zahn2000NMR). 

The prion protein can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, and its structure is crucial for its normal function and its role in disease. The transformation from the cellular form (PrP^C) to the scrapie form (PrP^Sc) involves significant conformational changes, particularly an increase in β-sheet content (Wüthrich2001Threedimensional).

## Function
The PRNP gene encodes the prion protein (PrP), which plays several roles in healthy human cells. PrP is highly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), particularly in neurons, and is involved in various physiological processes. It contributes to CNS development, neurite outgrowth, and neuronal survival by binding to the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and acting as a signaling receptor (Hu2008Prion). PrP also protects neurons against Bax-mediated cell death by inhibiting the mitochondrial proapoptotic pathway, suggesting a neuroprotective function (Roucou2004Cellular).

PrP is implicated in synaptic transmission and maintenance of Ca2+-activated K+ currents, which are essential for memory formation and cognition (Hu2008Prion). It also plays a role in regulating circadian rhythms and is involved in intracellular signaling through the phosphorylation of tyrosine kinase Fyn (Hu2008Prion). In the immune system, PrP is expressed by antigen-presenting cells and T lymphocytes, where it is involved in T cell activation and proliferation (Hu2008Prion).

PrP's interaction with laminin, a glycoprotein involved in neuronal differentiation, suggests its role in promoting neuronal plasticity and survival (Graner2000Cellular). The protein's ability to bind metal ions like copper may also contribute to its antioxidant properties, protecting cells from oxidative stress (Roucou2004Cellular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PRNP gene are associated with several neurodegenerative disorders, collectively known as prion diseases. These include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS), and Fatal Familial Insomnia (FFI). These conditions are characterized by the accumulation of misfolded prion proteins, leading to brain damage and a range of clinical symptoms (Takada2016Genetic; Bernardi2019Mutations).

Familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (fCJD) presents as rapidly progressive dementia with motor features, similar to sporadic CJD, and typically results in death within a few months. Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome is marked by ataxia, parkinsonian symptoms, and dementia, with survival ranging from three to ten years. Fatal Familial Insomnia is characterized by insomnia, dysautonomia, cognitive impairment, and motor features, with a median survival of about 18 months (Takada2016Genetic).

The PRNP gene mutations include point mutations, insertions, and deletions, which can lead to a spectrum of clinical and pathological phenotypes. Specific mutations, such as D178N-codon 129V, are associated with fCJD, while D178N-codon 129M is linked to FFI. The codon 129 polymorphism significantly influences the clinical phenotype, with methionine at codon 129 associated with FFI and valine with fCJD (Takada2016Genetic; Bernardi2019Mutations).

## Interactions
The PRNP gene encodes the cellular prion protein (PrPc), which participates in various interactions with other proteins, influencing numerous cellular processes and contributing to the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases. PrPc interacts with the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR), playing a crucial role in neuronal survival and differentiation, and is implicated in prion-related diseases (Miranzadeh2020Cellular). It also binds to amyloid β oligomers (AβO) in Alzheimer's disease, mediating synaptic dysfunction and neurotoxicity (Miranzadeh2020Cellular).

PrPc interacts with metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR5), leading to neurotoxic signaling through Fyn kinase activation (Miranzadeh2020Cellular). It also forms complexes with the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), promoting neuritogenesis via Fyn kinase activation (Santuccione2005Prion; Miranzadeh2020Cellular). The interaction with Na,K-ATPases (NKAs) enhances ion uptake activity, which is significant for cellular ion homeostasis (Williams2021The).

PrPc's interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, confirmed in human brain extracts, may influence neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects (Miranzadeh2020Cellular). It also interacts with protein kinase CK2, affecting neuronal connectivity in prion diseases (Miranzadeh2020Cellular). These interactions underscore PrPc's multifaceted role in neuronal signaling, development, and disease pathogenesis.
