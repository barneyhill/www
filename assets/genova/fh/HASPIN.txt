# HASPIN

## Overview
HASPIN is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase known as histone H3 associated protein kinase. This kinase is integral to the regulation of mitosis, primarily through its role in phosphorylating histone H3 at threonine 3 (H3T3), a modification crucial for the proper localization of the Chromosomal Passenger Complex (CPC) at centromeres. The structural uniqueness of HASPIN, including its atypical kinase domain and absence of common motifs found in other kinases, underpins its specialized function in chromatin organization and chromosome segregation during cell division (Villa2009Crystal; Eswaran2009Structure). Beyond its fundamental role in mitosis, HASPIN is implicated in various cellular processes and diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, due to its influence on chromosomal stability and cell cycle regulation (Tang2023GSG2; Tanaka2023Ingestion).

## Structure
HASPIN, a serine/threonine kinase, exhibits a unique molecular structure that distinguishes it from typical eukaryotic protein kinases. The primary structure of HASPIN includes a kinase domain spanning residues Lys-470 to Lys-798, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (Eswaran2009Structure). The secondary structure features a bilobed architecture with a small N-terminal lobe and a larger C-terminal lobe, forming a catalytic cleft at their interface (Villa2009Crystal). Notably, HASPIN lacks the αG helix and the DFG motif, which are common in other kinases, and instead contains a DYT motif and a large helical insert (Lavogina2016Cocrystal; Eswaran2009Structure).

The tertiary structure of HASPIN is characterized by several unique features, including a helical insert (ulH) that stabilizes the P-loop, and a β-hairpin insert between strands β7 and β8, which anchors the αC C-terminal loop (Eswaran2009Structure). HASPIN functions as a monomer, indicating it lacks a quaternary structure (Villa2009Crystal). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence HASPIN's activity, although specific modifications are not detailed in the context provided. The structural adaptations of HASPIN facilitate its role in chromatin organization and mitotic phosphorylation of histone H3 (Villa2009Crystal).

## Function
Haspin, encoded by the human gene HASPIN, is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a critical role in mitosis by phosphorylating histone H3 at threonine 3 (H3T3) (Cartwright2022Dissecting; Eswaran2009Structure). This phosphorylation is essential for the correct positioning of the Chromosomal Passenger Complex (CPC) at inner centromeres, which is crucial for chromosome alignment and segregation during cell division (Cartwright2022Dissecting; Dai2005The). Haspin's activity is necessary for maintaining chromosome cohesion, as its depletion leads to premature chromatid separation and activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint (Dai2006Regulation; Eswaran2009Structure).

Haspin is active in the nucleus during interphase and localizes to chromosomes during mitosis (Eswaran2009Structure). It is involved in the regulation of chromatin structure, potentially affecting the recruitment or function of condensins, cohesins, and topoisomerases, which are important for chromosome alignment and segregation (Dai2005The). The kinase is also associated with centrosomes and the spindle, suggesting additional roles in mitotic spindle function (Dai2005The). Haspin's function is conserved across eukaryotes, indicating its fundamental role in cell division (Cartwright2022Dissecting; Dai2005The).

## Clinical Significance
HASPIN, also known as GSG2, is implicated in various cancers due to its role in cell division and chromosomal stability. Overexpression of HASPIN is frequently observed in breast cancer, where it is associated with poor prognosis and increased tumor proliferation. In breast cancer cells, HASPIN interacts with E2F1, promoting cancer progression through MDM2-mediated ubiquitination of E2F1 (Tang2023GSG2; Ye2019Bioinformatic). Inhibition of HASPIN has been shown to reduce tumor growth and enhance anti-tumor immunity, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in multiple cancer types, including melanoma, multiple myeloma, and Ewing sarcoma (Melms2020Inhibition).

In pancreatic cancer, HASPIN is upregulated and associated with aggressive tumor behavior. Knockdown of HASPIN in pancreatic cancer models results in reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis, indicating its role in cancer progression (Han2019Haspin). HASPIN is also involved in Alzheimer's disease, where its activity affects tau protein phosphorylation, a key factor in the disease's pathology. Inhibition of HASPIN has been shown to reduce tau phosphorylation, suggesting a potential therapeutic role in Alzheimer's disease (Tanaka2023Ingestion). These findings highlight HASPIN's significance in both cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.

## Interactions
HASPIN, a serine/threonine kinase, is involved in several critical protein interactions that influence its role in cell division and chromatin organization. It interacts with the cohesin subunit Pds5B through its non-catalytic N-terminus, which is essential for its centromeric localization. The C-terminal kinase domain of HASPIN binds and phosphorylates the YSR motif of Wapl, inhibiting the interaction between Wapl and Pds5B, thereby protecting centromeric cohesion (Liang2017A). HASPIN also interacts with Aurora B kinase, forming a positive feedback loop that promotes the accumulation of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) at centromeres during mitosis (Wang2011A).

In spermatids, HASPIN phosphorylates C1QBP, and interacts with proteins such as CENPJ and KPNA6, which are involved in microtubule polymerization and cell cycle regulation (Maeda2022Analysis). The interaction with C1QBP is particularly significant in the context of spermatogenesis and may also play a role in cancer cell growth (Maeda2022Analysis). These interactions highlight HASPIN's multifaceted role in maintaining chromosomal stability and regulating cell division processes.
