# STX8

## Overview
STX8 is a gene that encodes the protein syntaxin 8, a member of the SNARE (Soluble NSF Attachment Protein Receptor) family, which plays a crucial role in vesicular transport and membrane fusion processes within cells. Syntaxin 8 is characterized as a transmembrane protein, featuring a hydrophobic domain that anchors it to cellular membranes, and is involved in forming SNARE complexes essential for the fusion of vesicles with target membranes. This protein is particularly significant in the trafficking of key cellular components, such as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and claudin-16, influencing processes like ion homeostasis and magnesium reabsorption. The gene and its encoded protein have been implicated in various physiological and pathological contexts, including cystic fibrosis, visual epilepsy, and developmental defects, underscoring their importance in cellular function and human health (Sabirzhanova2018Syntaxin; Bilan2004Syntaxin; Ikari2014Tight).

## Structure
Syntaxin 8 (STX8) is a SNARE protein involved in vesicular transport, characterized by a primary structure of 236 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 26,894 daltons (Subramaniam2000Preferential). The protein features an 18-residue hydrophobic domain at the C-terminus, likely serving as a membrane anchor, a common trait among SNARE proteins (Subramaniam2000Preferential). Syntaxin 8 contains regions capable of forming coiled-coil structures, which are important for its function in vesicle docking and fusion (Subramaniam2000Preferential).

The tertiary structure of STX8 includes a SNARE domain, a conserved 60-70 amino acid α-helix with heptad repeats, facilitating vesicle and organelle membrane fusion (Yanguas2021Analysis). The quaternary structure involves its participation in SNARE complexes, such as with syntaxin 7, vti1b, and endobrevin, crucial for the homotypic fusion of late endosomes (Kasai2008Syntaxin).

STX8 also contains di-leucine-based motifs in its cytoplasmic domain, which are involved in endocytic and exocytic processes. These motifs are functionally distinct, with one motif playing a significant role in internalization from the plasma membrane (Kasai2008Syntaxin). The protein's recycling and localization are influenced by specific motifs and interactions with the retromer complex (Yanguas2021Analysis).

## Function
Syntaxin 8 (STX8) is a SNARE protein involved in the regulation of vesicular transport processes within cells. It plays a significant role in the trafficking and function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a chloride channel crucial for electrolyte transport across epithelial cells. Overexpression of STX8 impairs CFTR trafficking to the plasma membrane and inhibits its channel activity, suggesting that STX8 regulates CFTR by affecting its localization and recycling within the cell (Bilan2004Syntaxin).

STX8 is also involved in the trafficking of claudin-16 (CLDN16) in renal tubular epithelial cells, which is essential for magnesium reabsorption in the kidney. It facilitates the transport of CLDN16 to the plasma membrane, influencing its localization at tight junctions. This process is dependent on the phosphorylation state of CLDN16, as dephosphorylated CLDN16 cannot bind to STX8 (Ikari2014Tight).

In addition to its role in CFTR and CLDN16 trafficking, STX8 is implicated in the regulation of plasma membrane ion channels and may be involved in ion homeostasis, a function that might be conserved across different species (Yanguas2021Analysis).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the STX8 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. STX8 is associated with cystic fibrosis, particularly in the processing of the ΔF508-CFTR mutation, which is the most common mutation causing the disease. Silencing STX8 has been shown to enhance the maturation and function of ΔF508-CFTR, suggesting that STX8 plays a role in the quality control and trafficking of this protein (Sabirzhanova2018Syntaxin).

STX8 has also been linked to visual epilepsy, indicating its involvement in synaptic vesicle metabolism and protein trafficking, which are critical for normal neurological function (Wang2015Genomewide). Additionally, disruptions in STX8 have been observed in genomic studies of human embryos with developmental defects, suggesting a role in early human development (RajcanSeparovic2009Genomic).

Alterations in STX8 expression or function may contribute to conditions such as basal cell carcinoma and embolism and thrombosis, as indicated by its association with these diseases in genetic studies (Han2024PTGES2). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of STX8 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
Syntaxin 8 (STX8) is involved in various protein interactions, primarily within the SNARE complex, which is crucial for vesicular transport and membrane fusion. STX8 interacts with the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), forming complexes that affect CFTR's trafficking and channel activity. This interaction is weaker compared to CFTR's binding with syntaxin 1A, but it still significantly impairs CFTR trafficking and inhibits its channel activity (Bilan2004Syntaxin). STX8 also interacts with other SNARE proteins such as VAMP8 and vti1b, suggesting its role in a multimeric complex that may include these proteins (Bilan2004Syntaxin).

In the context of platelet function, STX8 forms complexes with syntaxin 11 (STX11) and is involved in dense granule secretion, aggregation, and thrombus stability. This interaction is crucial for platelet function, particularly in response to thrombin and CRP (Golebiewska2015Syntaxin). Additionally, STX8 is implicated in the processing of the ΔF508-CFTR mutant protein, where it interacts with quality control proteins like heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27) and heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60), influencing the protein's degradation and processing (Sabirzhanova2018Syntaxin).
