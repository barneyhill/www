# IL16

## Overview
Interleukin 16 (IL16) is a gene that encodes the cytokine protein interleukin 16, which plays a significant role in immune regulation and cellular signaling. The IL16 gene is responsible for producing a precursor protein, pro-IL-16, which is subsequently cleaved to form the mature cytokine. Interleukin 16 functions primarily as a chemoattractant, guiding CD4+ T cells and other immune cells to sites of inflammation, and interacts with the CD4 receptor to initiate signaling pathways crucial for immune responses (Cruikshank2000Interleukin16; Richmond2013Regulation). Beyond its immunological roles, IL-16 also acts as a scaffold protein in neuronal cells, influencing cell survival and growth (Richmond2013Regulation). The gene's polymorphisms have been linked to various diseases, including cancer and inflammatory conditions, highlighting its clinical significance (Gao2008The; Matalliotakis2018The).

## Structure
The molecular structure of Interleukin 16 (IL-16) is characterized by a resemblance to PDZ domains, which are known for mediating protein-protein interactions. However, IL-16's PDZ-like domain has an occluded peptide binding site due to structural alterations, specifically a smaller GLGF cleft blocked by a tryptophan side chain (Mühlhahn1998Structure). The tertiary structure of IL-16 includes α-helices and β-strands, with specific residues involved in these structures identified through NMR spectroscopy (Mühlhahn1998Structure). 

IL-16 is synthesized as a precursor molecule, pro-IL-16, which is cleaved by caspase 3 to release a bioactive peptide consisting of the carboxy-terminal 121 amino acids (Cruikshank2000Interleukin16). The bioactive form of IL-16 is capable of forming homotetramers, although dimers may also be bioactive (Cruikshank2000Interleukin16). 

IL-16 does not require glycosylation for its bioactivity and lacks a consensus secretory leader sequence, with its release mechanism remaining unclear (Cruikshank2000Interleukin16). The protein is highly conserved across species, particularly at the carboxyl terminal, which is crucial for its interaction with the CD4 receptor (Cruikshank2000Interleukin16).

## Function
Interleukin 16 (IL16) is a multifunctional cytokine involved in immune regulation and cellular signaling in healthy human cells. It is synthesized as a precursor protein, pro-IL-16, which is cleaved by caspase-3 to form the mature protein. IL-16 functions primarily as a chemoattractant for CD4+ T cells, eosinophils, mast cells, dendritic cells, monocytes, and B lymphocytes, facilitating their migration to sites of inflammation (Richmond2013Regulation; Cruikshank2000Interleukin16). The primary receptor for IL-16 is CD4, and its binding initiates a signaling cascade that involves the activation of the CD4-associated src-related tyrosine kinase p56 lck, leading to downstream signaling pathways crucial for the chemotactic response in T cells (Richmond2013Regulation).

IL-16 also plays a role in modulating T cell responses by inhibiting TCR/CD3-mediated activation, preventing TCR-induced IL-2Rα expression and IL-2 production, and potentially inhibiting NF-B activity (Cruikshank2000Interleukin16). In neuronal cells, IL-16 functions as a scaffold protein for ion channels and is involved in neuronal cell activation, promoting cell survival, proliferation, and growth (Richmond2013Regulation). Pro-IL-16, the precursor form, acts as a transcriptional repressor in the nucleus of resting T cells, inhibiting the cell cycle control protein Skp2, which leads to the accumulation of the cyclin kinase inhibitor p27 KIP1, preventing cell cycle entry (Center2004Nuclear).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the IL16 gene have been associated with various diseases, highlighting its clinical significance. The rs11556218 T/G polymorphism in the IL16 gene is linked to an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) and gastric cancer (GC), particularly in individuals carrying the G allele. Conversely, women with the T allele have a decreased risk for these cancers (Gao2008The). This polymorphism is also associated with endometriosis, with the G allele increasing susceptibility to the condition (Matalliotakis2018The).

In the context of inflammatory diseases, the rs11556218 polymorphism is associated with a lower risk of periodontitis in nonsmokers (Souza2020Association). It is also linked to a decreased risk of knee osteoarthritis in women (Luo2015Genetic). The same polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), with the TG genotype conferring a higher risk (Mohammad2021Association).

Alterations in IL16 expression levels have been observed in various conditions. For instance, increased serum IL-16 levels have been reported in patients with T2DM (Mohammad2021Association) and knee osteoarthritis (Luo2015Genetic). These findings underscore the role of IL16 in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, as well as its potential involvement in cancer pathogenesis.

## Interactions
Interleukin 16 (IL-16) interacts primarily with the CD4 receptor on immune cells, which is crucial for its bioactivity. IL-16 binds to the D4 domain of CD4, specifically requiring the amino acid sequence from W345 to S350 for this interaction (Cruikshank2000Interleukin16; Liu1999Identification). This binding is essential for IL-16-induced cell signaling and is similar to the interaction of HIV-1 gp120 with CD4 (Cruikshank2000Interleukin16). IL-16 does not require a co-receptor for CD4 signaling but may associate with CCR5, as IL-16 stimulation can cross-desensitize CCR5 signaling (Cruikshank2000Interleukin16).

IL-16 is biologically active only in its multimeric form, indicating that cross-linking of CD4 molecules is necessary for its signaling (Cruikshank2000Interleukin16). The interaction of IL-16 with CD4 facilitates CD4 cross-linking, which is necessary for MHC class II-dependent cell activation (Cruikshank2000Interleukin16). Despite its structural resemblance to PDZ domains, IL-16 does not exhibit typical peptide binding properties associated with these domains (Mühlhahn1998Structure). IL-16's interaction with CD4 is supported by functional evidence, such as its ability to induce chemotactic responses in CD4+ T lymphocytes and inhibit these responses with anti-CD4 antibodies (Liu1999Identification).
