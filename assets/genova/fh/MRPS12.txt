# MRPS12

## Overview
The MRPS12 gene encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S12, a key component of the small 28S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein is integral to mitochondrial protein synthesis, facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA necessary for oxidative phosphorylation. As a ribosomal protein, MRPS12 is categorized within the structural constituents of the ribosome, playing a pivotal role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the mitoribosome. It is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, underscoring its essential role in cellular energy production and metabolism. Mutations or alterations in MRPS12 can lead to mitochondrial disorders and have been implicated in conditions such as cancer and non-syndromic hearing loss, highlighting its clinical significance (Kaushal2014CryoEM; Cheong2020Expression; Bacon2024Mitochondrial).

## Function
The MRPS12 gene encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S12, which is a component of the small 28S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein plays a critical role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA, which is essential for the production of proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation (Kaushal2014CryoEM; Cheong2020Expression). MRPS12 is involved in the assembly and function of the mitoribosome, a complex crucial for mitochondrial translation, and contains a dsRNA binding domain that suggests its interaction with mitochondrial rRNA (Cheong2020Expression).

The protein is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, highlighting its indispensable role in cellular processes, particularly in energy-demanding processes like cellular respiration (Cheong2020Expression). MRPS12 is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the ribosome, as it is positioned on the mito-SSU body, contributing to the decoding of mitochondrial mRNAs (Kaushal2014CryoEM). The proper function of MRPS12 is vital for mitochondrial function and energy production, impacting cellular respiration and overall cellular metabolism (Kaushal2014CryoEM). Defects in mitochondrial translation, including mutations in MRPS12, can lead to various mitochondrial disorders, underscoring its critical role in healthy human cells (Cheong2020Expression).

## Clinical Significance
The MRPS12 gene is implicated in various diseases and conditions due to mutations, expression alterations, or changes in its interactions. In cancer, increased expression of MRPS12 is associated with metastatic traits and therapeutic resistance, particularly in breast and ovarian cancers. In breast cancer, MRPS12 expression is linked to tumor recurrence and tamoxifen resistance, while in ovarian cancer, it correlates with recurrence and advanced disease stages. Overexpression of MRPS12 is linked to the activation of pathways such as cell cycle activation, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, and p53, which may limit apoptosis in cancer cells, contributing to increased tumor recurrence (Gopisetty2016Mammalian; Bacon2024Mitochondrial).

MRPS12 is also involved in non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL) associated with aminoglycoside sensitivity. Specific mutations, such as the R68L substitution, can modify the phenotype of pathological mutations like m.1555A>G and m.1494C>T in the mitochondrial 12S rRNA, potentially offering protection against aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss (Emperador2015An). Variants in MRPS12, such as 283G>A and 139G>A, are linked to conditions like deafness due to their impact on ribosomal function and fidelity (VilaSanjurjo2023Structural). These findings suggest that MRPS12 plays a significant role in both cancer progression and hearing loss.

## Interactions
MRPS12 is a mitochondrial ribosomal protein that plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by interacting with mitochondrial rRNA and other ribosomal components. It is located near the A site of the ribosome and is involved in decoding during protein synthesis. MRPS12 interacts with the RNA backbone and other ribosomal components through hydrogen bonds and other molecular interactions, which are essential for its function (VilaSanjurjo2023Structural).

The protein is part of a complex network of interactions within the mitochondrial ribosome. It is structurally similar to its bacterial counterpart, ribosomal protein S12, and is involved in maintaining genetic decoding fidelity. Variants in proximity to MRPS12, such as 459C>U and 460U>C, may affect ribosomal function by causing small distortions that lead to fidelity defects (VilaSanjurjo2023Structural).

MRPS12 also contains a dsRNA binding domain, suggesting a potential interaction with the 16S/12S rRNA, which is crucial for its role in the mitoribosome (Cheong2020Expression). These interactions highlight the importance of MRPS12 in the assembly and function of the mitochondrial ribosome, contributing to mitochondrial translation and overall cellular energy production.
