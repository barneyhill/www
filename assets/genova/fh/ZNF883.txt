# ZNF883

## Overview
ZNF883 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 883, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by their zinc finger domains, which facilitate binding to DNA and play crucial roles in transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger protein 883 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and proliferation pathways, which are critical for normal development and cellular function (Conteduca2022NSD1). The gene's expression and regulation have been implicated in several medical conditions, such as Sotos syndrome and potentially in cancer, highlighting its significance in both developmental and pathological contexts (Peixoto2020TCox:; Conteduca2022NSD1). Further research is necessary to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which ZNF883 influences these processes and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZNF883 has been implicated in several medical conditions due to its altered expression levels. In Sotos syndrome (SoS), a disorder characterized by overgrowth and developmental delays, ZNF883 is upregulated in patients with NSD1 mutations. This upregulation suggests a potential role in the syndrome's pathogenesis, possibly linked to its involvement in cell cycle regulation and proliferation pathways (Conteduca2022NSD1). The study highlights the overexpression of ZNF883 in SoS patients, suggesting its potential role in the disease, although the exact mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated (Conteduca2022NSD1).

In the context of cancer, ZNF883 has been identified in studies analyzing colorectal cancer survival data. Although it was not highlighted for clinical significance, its selection by various models indicates a potential association with cancer hallmarks (Peixoto2020TCox:). The gene's involvement in transcriptional regulation and DNA binding suggests that its dysregulation could contribute to oncogenic processes. However, specific clinical implications of ZNF883 mutations or expression changes in cancer remain to be clarified. Further research is needed to understand the full extent of ZNF883's role in these conditions.
