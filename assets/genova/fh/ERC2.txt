# ERC2

## Overview
ERC2 is a gene that encodes the protein ELKS/RAB6-interacting/CAST family member 2, which is integral to the function of presynaptic active zones in neurons. This protein is categorized as a scaffolding protein due to its role in organizing and maintaining the structural integrity of synaptic sites. ERC2 is primarily expressed in the brain, where it facilitates synaptic vesicle trafficking and neurotransmitter release by interacting with other presynaptic proteins such as RIM1, liprin-α, and syntenin-1. These interactions are crucial for the assembly and function of the active zone, a specialized area of the synapse responsible for efficient synaptic transmission. The protein's involvement in modulating intracellular calcium levels further underscores its importance in synaptic activity regulation (Hida2010CAST; Ko2003Interaction; Arancibia2019Serine–Arginine).

## Structure
The ERC2 protein, also known as ELKS/RAB6-interacting/CAST family member 2, is characterized by its structural features that facilitate its role in synaptic vesicle trafficking and neurotransmitter release. ERC2 contains four coiled-coil (CC) domains, which are crucial for its protein-protein interactions, particularly with other presynaptic active zone proteins such as RIM1 and liprin-α (Hida2010CAST; Ko2003Interaction). The C-terminal region of ERC2 includes a PDZ domain binding motif, which is essential for interactions with proteins like syntenin-1 and RIM1 (Ko2003Interaction; Ko2006Organization).

ERC2 is primarily expressed in the brain and is localized at presynaptic sites, where it forms complexes with other active zone proteins, including ELKS, Bassoon, Piccolo, and Munc13-1 (Kiyonaka2012Physical). The protein does not have known splice variants, distinguishing it from its family member ERC1, which has two splice variants (Ko2006Organization). While specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of ERC2 are not provided, its interactions and localization suggest a significant role in the molecular organization of presynaptic active zones (Ko2003Interaction).

## Function
The ERC2 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in synaptic vesicle trafficking and neurotransmitter release in neurons. It is a crucial component of the presynaptic active zone, where it interacts with other proteins to maintain synaptic integrity and facilitate efficient synaptic transmission. ERC2 is involved in the assembly of the active zone scaffolding protein complex, which is essential for synaptic function and plasticity (Arancibia2019Serine–Arginine). 

The protein interacts with several other presynaptic proteins, including Munc13-1, Aczonin, Bassoon, and Rim, forming a complex that is highly enriched at active zones. These interactions are vital for the molecular organization of the active zone, which is critical for neurotransmitter release and synaptic communication (Arancibia2019Serine–Arginine). ERC2's role in modulating protein interactions at the synaptic active zone is crucial for maintaining the structure and function of synaptic connections (Arancibia2019Serine–Arginine).

In addition to its role in synaptic assembly, ERC2 is involved in the modulation of intracellular calcium levels, which is important for neurotransmitter release. This modulation is achieved through its interactions with other proteins at the active zone, contributing to the regulation of synaptic activity (Cheng2021IDH1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ERC2 gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions. In Maffucci's syndrome, a specific mutation, ERC2 L309I, has been identified as contributing to the development of hemangiomas by enhancing angiogenesis and increasing intracellular calcium concentration in endothelial cells. This mutation is specific to Maffucci's syndrome and is not found in Ollier disease, which shares some clinical features but lacks hemangiomas (Cheng2021IDH1).

Beyond Maffucci's syndrome, alterations in ERC2 expression and function have been associated with neurological disorders. The ERC2 protein, also known as CAST, plays a crucial role in synaptic vesicle trafficking and neurotransmitter release. Disruptions in its interactions with voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs) can impair synaptic transmission, potentially contributing to conditions such as epilepsy and autism spectrum disorders. Studies have shown that ERC2 interacts with the β4-subunit of VDCCs, affecting the voltage dependence of channel activation, which is critical for proper synaptic function (Kiyonaka2012Physical).

These findings highlight the importance of ERC2 in both skeletal and neurological health, with mutations leading to significant clinical manifestations.

## Interactions
ERC2, also known as ELKS, is involved in various protein interactions crucial for synaptic function. It interacts with the liprin-α family of multidomain proteins, including liprin-α1, liprin-α2, liprin-α3, and liprin-α4. These interactions are important for the presynaptic localization of liprin-α and the organization of presynaptic active zones. ERC2 colocalizes with liprin-α1 at synaptic sites and forms complexes with it, as demonstrated by immunofluorescence staining and GST pull-down assays (Ko2003Interaction).

ERC2 also interacts with syntenin-1 through a PDZ domain interaction, which is essential for the clustering of syntenin-1 at presynaptic sites. This interaction involves both PDZ domains of syntenin-1, with PDZ2 being critical for binding. The interaction was confirmed through yeast two-hybrid, pull-down, and coimmunoprecipitation assays (Ko2006Organization).

Additionally, ERC2 is part of a complex network at the active zone, interacting with other proteins such as RIM, Bassoon, and Aczonin. These interactions are crucial for the assembly and function of the active zone, which is essential for neurotransmitter release (Arancibia2019Serine–Arginine).
