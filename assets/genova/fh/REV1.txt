# REV1

## Overview
REV1 is a gene that encodes the REV1 DNA-directed polymerase, a member of the Y-family DNA polymerases, which plays a pivotal role in translesion DNA synthesis (TLS). This process allows DNA replication to continue past lesions that would otherwise impede replication fork progression. The REV1 protein is characterized by its C-terminal domain (CTD), which functions as a scaffold to facilitate the assembly of translesion polymerase complexes, interacting with other Y-family polymerases such as Polη, Polι, and Polκ. These interactions are crucial for maintaining genomic stability by promoting error-free lesion bypass, particularly in response to DNA damage. Beyond its role in TLS, REV1 is involved in the repair of complex DNA lesions, including cross-links, and is linked to the Fanconi anemia pathway. Clinically, alterations in REV1 expression are associated with various cancers, where its overexpression is linked to poor prognosis and increased tumorigenesis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Eddy2013Human; Hicks2010Differential; Chen2022REV1).

## Structure
The human REV1 protein is a DNA-directed polymerase involved in translesion synthesis, characterized by a C-terminal domain (CTD) that plays a crucial role in its function. The CTD of REV1 is composed of approximately 100 amino acids and adopts a four-helix bundle structure, which includes a well-structured N-terminal β-hairpin. This domain is essential for mediating interactions with other Y-family DNA polymerases, such as polη, polι, and polκ, as well as with the Rev7 subunit of polζ (Pozhidaeva2012NMR).

The REV1-CTD serves as a scaffold, facilitating the assembly of translesion polymerase complexes. It interacts with the Rev1 interacting region (RIR) of DNA polymerase η, which forms an α-helix upon binding. This interaction is mediated by a conserved motif in the RIR, characterized by two phenylalanine residues, which are crucial for binding to a hydrophobic pocket on the REV1-CTD surface (Pozhidaeva2012NMR).

The structural dynamics of the REV1-CTD, including its conformational flexibility on the microsecond to millisecond time scale, may facilitate efficient binding of RIR motifs, minimizing the entropic penalty of complex formation (Pozhidaeva2012NMR). This plasticity is important for the protein's role in DNA damage tolerance.

## Function
The human REV1 gene encodes a DNA-directed polymerase that plays a critical role in translesion DNA synthesis (TLS), a process that allows DNA replication to bypass lesions that would otherwise stall replication forks. REV1 is particularly involved in the replication of G-quadruplex (G4) DNA structures, which are stable four-stranded configurations that can impede replication fork progression. It can bind to and disrupt these structures, facilitating replication fork progression without requiring its nucleotidyl transfer activity (Eddy2013Human).

REV1 functions as a central regulator of TLS by interacting with other DNA polymerases, such as Polη, Polκ, and Polι, but not with Polζ, to promote error-free lesion bypass, particularly in response to UV-induced DNA damage (Yoon2015Rev1). It acts as a scaffolding component, facilitating the assembly of these polymerases at sites of DNA damage, thereby maintaining genomic stability (Yoon2015Rev1).

In addition to its role in TLS, REV1 is involved in the repair of DNA cross-links, including both intrastrand and interstrand cross-links, and is crucial for maintaining genomic stability by facilitating the repair of complex DNA lesions (Hicks2010Differential). Its activity is linked to the Fanconi anemia pathway, suggesting its involvement in interstrand cross-link repair (Hicks2010Differential).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the REV1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. Overexpression of REV1 is associated with poor prognosis in lung cancer patients and is linked to increased tumorigenesis. This overexpression is observed in lung cancer tissues compared to adjacent non-cancerous tissues and is associated with the activation of the Rad18/SERTAD2 axis, promoting lung tumorigenesis (Chen2022REV1). REV1 overexpression also contributes to radioresistance in lung cancer by facilitating the degradation of cystathionine γ-lyase (CTH), affecting amino acid metabolism and creating an abnormal tumor microenvironment (Chen2024USP9X-mediated).

In addition to lung cancer, REV1 overexpression has been implicated in the development of carcinogen-induced intestinal adenomas. Studies using transgenic mouse models have shown that increased REV1 expression accelerates tumor formation by enhancing mutagenesis and suppressing apoptosis (Sasatani2017Overexpression). REV1 is also involved in the pathogenesis of human glioma and is linked to drug resistance in various cancers, suggesting its role as an oncogene (Sasatani2017Overexpression; Sasatani2020The). These findings highlight the potential of targeting REV1 as a therapeutic strategy in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
The human REV1 protein, a member of the Y-family DNA polymerases, plays a crucial role in translesion synthesis (TLS) by interacting with various proteins to facilitate DNA damage tolerance. REV1's C-terminal domain (CTD) is essential for its scaffolding function, enabling the assembly of a quaternary translesion polymerase complex. This complex includes the heterodimeric DNA polymerase ζ (Pol ζ), composed of the catalytic subunit REV3 and the non-catalytic subunit REV7, and the Rev1-interacting region of Pol κ (Kikuchi2012Structural; Wojtaszek2012Structural).

REV1 interacts with other Y-family polymerases, such as Pol η, Pol ι, and Pol κ, through their Rev1-interacting regions (RIRs), which contain two consecutive phenylalanine residues. These interactions are mediated by the Rev1-CTD and are crucial for effective lesion bypass (Pozhidaeva2012NMR). The binding of REV1 to REV7 is particularly important for recruiting Pol ζ to stalled replication forks, facilitating polymerase switching and DNA repair processes (Kikuchi2012Structural).

In addition to its interactions with Y-family polymerases, REV1 also forms complexes with other proteins involved in TLS, such as the Pol32 subunit of DNA polymerase δ, which is essential for targeting Pol ζ to replication forks stalled at DNA lesions (Acharya2009Yeast). These interactions highlight REV1's role as a central coordinator in the TLS pathway, ensuring DNA replication continues despite the presence of DNA damage.
