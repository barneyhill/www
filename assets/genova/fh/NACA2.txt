# NACA2

## Overview
NACA2 is a gene that encodes the nascent polypeptide-associated complex subunit alpha 2, a protein involved in various cellular processes. This protein is part of the nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC), which plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by interacting with ribosomes and nascent polypeptide chains. The NAC is essential for proper protein folding and targeting, thereby influencing cellular homeostasis and function. NACA2 has been studied for its involvement in several diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, due to its regulatory role in protein synthesis and cellular stress responses. The gene's expression and potential mutations have been linked to clinical outcomes, making it a subject of interest for therapeutic research (Chung2017Genome‐wide; Li2017A; Ji2022Identification; Wu2022Gene).

## Clinical Significance
NACA2 has been implicated in various diseases through alterations in its expression levels and potential mutations. In breast cancer, NACA2 expression has shown a log2 fold increase of 1.0 over two decades, suggesting its potential as a clinical outcome predictor and therapeutic target. The number of patients with higher NACA2 expression has increased by about 10% over the last 20 years, indicating its growing clinical significance in breast cancer (Wu2022Gene). In ovarian cancer, NACA2 is associated with poor overall survival, as identified in a necroptosis-related risk score model. This model demonstrated that higher risk scores, which include NACA2, correlate with worse prognosis (Ji2022Identification).

NACA2 has also been linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) endophenotypes. A genome-wide association study identified a SNP near NACA2 associated with Aβ 42 levels in cognitively normal subjects, suggesting a potential role in AD-related traits (Chung2017Genome‐wide). Additionally, NACA2 was identified as one of the top genes in a pan-cancer classification study, although specific clinical significance or disease associations were not detailed (Li2017A). These findings highlight the diverse roles of NACA2 in different diseases, particularly in cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.
