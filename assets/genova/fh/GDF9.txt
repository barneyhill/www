# GDF9

## Overview
Growth Differentiation Factor 9 (GDF9) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily, specifically categorized as a growth factor. The GDF9 protein plays a pivotal role in ovarian folliculogenesis, influencing the development and function of oocytes and surrounding granulosa cells. It is primarily expressed in oocytes and functions through autocrine and paracrine signaling mechanisms, binding to specific transmembrane serine-threonine kinase receptors to activate intracellular SMAD signaling pathways. This activation is crucial for regulating gene expression related to follicular development and fertility. Mutations in the GDF9 gene have been linked to reproductive disorders such as primary ovarian insufficiency and premature ovarian failure, underscoring its importance in normal ovarian function and fertility (Laissue2006Mutations; Mottershead2008Characterization; Sanfins2018GDF9).

## Structure
Growth Differentiation Factor 9 (GDF9) is a protein encoded by the GDF9 gene and is a member of the TGF-beta superfamily. The primary structure of GDF9 consists of a polypeptide chain that includes a signal peptide, a prodomain, and a mature domain. The signal peptide is cleaved to facilitate the secretion of the protein (Belli2018Molecular). The secondary structure of GDF9 includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which contribute to its overall conformation. The tertiary structure of GDF9 features a cystine knot motif, a characteristic structure of TGF-beta proteins, although GDF9 uniquely lacks the fourth cysteine residue typically involved in forming intersubunit disulfide bonds (Belli2018Molecular).

In terms of quaternary structure, GDF9 functions as a noncovalently linked homodimer, differing from other TGF-beta family members that form covalent dimers (Belli2018Molecular). Post-translational modifications of GDF9 include glycosylation and phosphorylation, which are crucial for its bioactivity. Phosphorylation is necessary for GDF9's function, with specific kinases involved in this modification (Belli2018Molecular). These structural features and modifications are essential for GDF9's role in ovarian folliculogenesis and its interaction with other proteins such as BMP15.

## Function
Growth Differentiation Factor 9 (GDF9) is a crucial protein in human ovarian function, primarily expressed in oocytes. It is a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily and plays a significant role in folliculogenesis, which includes the proliferation, differentiation, and function of granulosa and thecal cells during follicular development (Mottershead2008Characterization; Sanfins2018GDF9). GDF9 acts through autocrine and paracrine mechanisms, influencing oocyte development, ovulation, fertilization, and embryonic competence (Sanfins2018GDF9).

GDF9 binds to specific transmembrane serine-threonine kinase receptors, particularly ALK5 and BMPRII, forming a heterodimeric complex that activates SMAD 2 and 3 signaling pathways. This signaling is essential for regulating target gene expression in the nucleus (Gilchrist2008Oocytesecreted; Sanfins2018GDF9). The protein is involved in regulating granulosa cell proliferation and differentiation, and it is essential for normal fertility (Mottershead2008Characterization).

In humans, GDF9 is expressed in oocytes from the primary follicle stage until after ovulation, with its mRNA detectable in ovulated oocytes (Sanfins2018GDF9). Mutations in the GDF9 gene are associated with reproductive abnormalities, such as subfertility, ovulation defects, and premature ovarian failure, highlighting its critical role in normal ovarian function and fertility (Mottershead2008Characterization; Sanfins2018GDF9).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GDF9 gene have been associated with several reproductive disorders, most notably primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) and premature ovarian failure (POF). POI is characterized by amenorrhea, hypoestrogenism, and elevated gonadotropin levels, occurring before the age of 40. Specific mutations in GDF9, such as the heterozygous transversion 557C>A leading to the S186Y amino acid change, have been linked to POF in patients, suggesting a potential pathogenic effect (Laissue2006Mutations). Another mutation, c.783delC, results in a premature termination codon and has been identified in a Brazilian patient with POI, indicating a possible autosomal recessive inheritance pattern (França2017Identification).

GDF9 mutations can also affect ovarian function by altering gene expression. A duplication affecting the regulatory region of GDF9, which includes crucial binding elements, has been identified as likely causative of POI by affecting gene expression (Norling2014Identification). Additionally, a homozygous truncating variant, c.604C>T, has been reported in siblings with POI, further establishing a gene-disease link (Verma2021A). These genetic variations highlight the role of GDF9 in ovarian dysfunction and its contribution to reproductive disorders.

## Interactions
GDF9 (Growth Differentiation Factor 9) is known to interact with Bone Morphogenetic Protein 15 (BMP15) to form heterodimers, which are crucial for their biological function in ovarian folliculogenesis. These interactions are significant in the context of their secretion and function in oocytes, where GDF9 and BMP15 can form heterodimers, although this is not typically observed in oocytes under in vitro conditions (Heath2017Molecular). The heterodimer, known as cumulin, activates the SMAD2/3 signaling pathway, which is essential for granulosa cell differentiation and function (Unknownauthors2017BMP15MutationsAssociatedWithPrimaryOvarianInsufficiencyReduceExpression; Sanfins2018GDF9).

GDF9 and BMP15 share a common type II receptor, BMPRII, but have distinct type I receptors, leading to different intracellular responses. GDF9 specifically activates the SMAD2/3 pathway, while BMP15 activates the SMAD1/5/8 pathway (Mottershead2011Signalling). The synergistic interaction between GDF9 and BMP15 involves the SMAD3 pathway and is dependent on ERK1/2 and SRC kinase signaling (Mottershead2011Signalling). These interactions are specific and cannot be replaced by other TGF-b superfamily members (Mottershead2011Signalling). The formation of heterodimers and their interaction with receptors are crucial for the regulation of granulosa and cumulus cell functions, impacting follicular development and ovulation (Heath2017Molecular).
