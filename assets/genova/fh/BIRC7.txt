# BIRC7

## Overview
BIRC7, also known as Livin, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family. The protein, baculoviral IAP repeat containing 7, is characterized by the presence of a baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR) domain, which plays a crucial role in inhibiting apoptosis by interacting with and inhibiting caspases, particularly caspase-9 (Elmekkawy2021LivinBIRC7; Kasof2001Livin). BIRC7 is unique among IAPs due to its single BIR domain and potential RING finger domain, which may contribute to its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (DubrezDaloz2008IAPS). The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in two isoforms, Livin α and Livin β, which exhibit distinct anti-apoptotic properties (Wu2006Expression). BIRC7 is primarily expressed in specific tissues such as the placenta and lymph nodes, and its dysregulation is associated with various cancers, where it contributes to tumor progression and resistance to apoptosis (Elmekkawy2021LivinBIRC7; Myung2013Expression).

## Structure
BIRC7, also known as Livin, is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family, characterized by the presence of a baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR) domain. This domain is approximately 70 amino acids long and typically includes four to five alpha helices and a three-stranded beta sheet, stabilized by a zinc ion coordinated by conserved cysteine and histidine residues (Verhagen2001Inhibitorofapoptosisproteinsandtheirrelatives:IAPsandotherBIRPs; DubrezDaloz2008IAPS). BIRC7 is unique among IAPs as it contains only one BIR domain, which is highly related to the BIR3 domains of other IAPs like cIAP-1, cIAP-2, and XIAP, featuring an alpha-helical extension carboxy-terminal to the BIR domain (Verhagen2001Inhibitorofapoptosisproteinsandtheirrelatives:IAPsandotherBIRPs).

BIRC7 is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in two splice variants, Livin α and Livin β, which differ by a 54 bp truncation in exon 6. These isoforms exhibit different anti-apoptotic effects, with Livin α associated with resistance to staurosporin and Livin β inducing resistance to TNF-α-induced apoptosis, UV radiation, and etoposide (MakuchKocka2021The; Wu2006Expression). The protein may also possess a RING finger domain, contributing to its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, although specific details on this domain in BIRC7 are not provided in the context (DubrezDaloz2008IAPS).

## Function
The BIRC7 gene, also known as Livin, encodes a protein that is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family. In healthy human cells, BIRC7 plays a crucial role in regulating apoptosis, a process of programmed cell death essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and development. The protein contains a baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) domain, which is critical for its ability to interact with and inhibit caspases, particularly caspase-9, thereby preventing apoptosis (Elmekkawy2021LivinBIRC7; Kasof2001Livin). 

BIRC7 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is involved in inhibiting both initiator and effector caspases, which are key enzymes in the execution phase of apoptosis (Ibrahim2014Expression). The protein also contains a RING-type zinc finger domain, which can enhance its anti-apoptotic activity, although it does not inhibit apoptosis on its own (Li2020BIRC7). 

In normal tissues, BIRC7 expression is limited, being detectable mainly in the placenta, spleen, lymph nodes, and developing embryonic tissues, suggesting a role in specific developmental or immune functions rather than widespread physiological processes (Elmekkawy2021LivinBIRC7).

## Clinical Significance
BIRC7, also known as Livin, is implicated in various cancers due to its role in inhibiting apoptosis. In colorectal cancer (CRC), BIRC7 is overexpressed and associated with tumor progression, metastasis, and resistance to chemotherapy. Studies have shown that BIRC7 expression is higher in CRC tissues compared to normal tissues and is linked to advanced tumor stages and poor survival outcomes (Zhang2022The; Myung2013Expression). The expression of BIRC7 is also correlated with tumor cell invasion, migration, and reduced apoptosis, suggesting its role in enhancing tumor aggressiveness (Myung2013Expression).

In endometrial carcinoma, BIRC7 is significantly overexpressed compared to endometrial hyperplasia and healthy controls, indicating its potential as a diagnostic biomarker (Elmekkawy2021LivinBIRC7). The gene's expression is positively correlated with oxidative stress markers, further linking it to cancer pathogenesis (Elmekkawy2021LivinBIRC7).

BIRC7 expression varies among different ethnic groups in CRC, with higher levels observed in Whites compared to African-Americans and Asians, although these differences do not significantly affect patient survival (Faruk2021Prognostic). Aspirin and FOLFOX chemotherapy have been shown to suppress BIRC7 expression, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach for CRC (Faruk2021Prognostic).

## Interactions
BIRC7, also known as Livin, is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) protein family and is involved in several protein interactions that contribute to its role in inhibiting apoptosis. BIRC7 contains a baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR) domain, which is crucial for its interaction with caspases, a family of proteases that play essential roles in apoptosis. By binding to caspases, BIRC7 inhibits their activity, thereby preventing the apoptotic process (Verhagen2001Inhibitorofapoptosisproteinsandtheirrelatives:IAPsandotherBIRPs; Yang2018High).

The BIR domain of BIRC7 also interacts with small molecule inhibitors, as demonstrated by studies using various assays to characterize these interactions. Compounds such as Birinapant and BV-6 have shown potent affinities for BIRC7, although these interactions are primarily with small molecules rather than other proteins or nucleic acids (Schwalm2022A).

BIRC7 is also involved in signaling pathways that promote cancer cell proliferation and invasion. In prostate cancer, upregulated Livin-a, a splicing variant of BIRC7, enhances cell proliferation and invasion through nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) signaling and the downstream Fibronectin (FN) and C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) pathway (Yang2018High).
