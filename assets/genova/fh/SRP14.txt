# SRP14

## Overview
SRP14 is a gene that encodes the signal recognition particle 14 (SRP14) protein, a critical component of the signal recognition particle (SRP) complex. This protein is integral to the co-translational targeting of secretory and membrane proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in eukaryotic cells. As a part of the SRP, SRP14 forms a heterodimer with SRP9, contributing to the Alu domain's function in translation elongation arrest, which is essential for the SRP's role in protein translocation (Kellogg2022Signal; Faoro2021Noncanonical). Beyond its canonical function, SRP14 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of specific RNAs and interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, including those related to viral processes, such as HIV-1 latency (Gussakovsky2023Nuclear; Khoury2021The). The gene's expression levels have clinical significance, being associated with conditions such as acute myeloid leukemia and cancer, and it plays a role in regulating HIV-1 latency and renal tubular apoptosis (Shi2021Identification; Tang2020SRP14).

## Function
SRP14 is a component of the signal recognition particle (SRP), a ribonucleoprotein complex essential for the co-translational targeting of secretory and membrane proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in eukaryotic cells. It forms a heterodimer with SRP9, which is part of the Alu domain of the SRP. This domain is responsible for arresting translation elongation, a critical step in the SRP's function of recognizing the hydrophobic signal peptide emerging from the ribosome. This recognition facilitates the formation of a ribosome nascent chain (RNC)-SRP complex, which docks with the SRP receptor on the ER membrane, allowing the nascent polypeptide chain to be translocated into the ER lumen (Kellogg2022Signal; Faoro2021Noncanonical).

In addition to its canonical role, SRP14, as part of the SRP9/SRP14 heterodimer, is involved in the transcriptional regulation of 7SL and BC200 RNA. This heterodimer is crucial for maintaining the steady-state levels of these RNAs by promoting transcription initiation and stabilizing nascent transcripts. It binds to the first ~50 nucleotides of nascent RNA, preventing rapid degradation and ensuring efficient transcription initiation by RNA polymerase III (Gussakovsky2023Nuclear).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SRP14 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), high expression of SRP14 is associated with poorer overall survival, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic biomarker. The gene is involved in several biological processes and signaling pathways, such as cell cycle regulation and NF-κB signaling, which are critical in the pathogenesis of AML (Shi2021Identification).

SRP14 also plays a role in cancer development, particularly in relation to the KRAS-variant, an oncogene frequently mutated in various cancers. Enhanced expression of SRP14 has been observed in cell lines positive for the KRAS-variant, indicating its potential involvement in cancer progression (Faoro2021Noncanonical).

In the context of HIV-1 infection, SRP14 acts as a negative regulator of latent infection. Knockdown of SRP14 leads to increased latent infection, highlighting its role in the regulation of HIV-1 latency and suggesting potential as a target for therapeutic intervention (Khoury2021The).

Additionally, SRP14 is involved in renal tubular apoptosis induced by ischemia-reperfusion injury, suggesting its role in kidney-related conditions (Tang2020SRP14).

## Interactions
SRP14 is a component of the signal recognition particle (SRP) and is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It forms a heterodimer with SRP9, which binds to the Alu portion of 7SL RNA, playing a crucial role in the elongation arrest activity of SRP. This interaction is essential for protein translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum in mammalian cells (Ivanova2015Alu). SRP14 also interacts with the HIV-1 Gag protein, indicating its involvement in virus-host interactions (Faoro2021Noncanonical).

In the context of HIV-1 latency, SRP14 binds near the start codon of Tat mRNA, suggesting a direct interaction that influences Tat mRNA processing and translation. This binding is associated with controlling Tat expression during latent infection (Khoury2021The). SRP14 is also part of the signal recognition particle RNP complex, which inhibits both cap- and IRES-dependent initiation by binding to 40S ribosomal subunits, preventing 48S complex formation (Khoury2021The).

Additionally, SRP14's interaction with Alu RNA promotes the functional binding of the SRP9/14 complex to the 40S ribosomal subunit, which is necessary for stress granule localization and translation inhibition (Ivanova2015Alu). These interactions highlight SRP14's multifaceted role in cellular processes and viral interactions.
