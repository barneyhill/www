# SLC39A4

## Overview
SLC39A4 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 39 member 4 (ZIP4), a transmembrane zinc transporter crucial for maintaining zinc homeostasis in the human body. ZIP4 is characterized by its eight transmembrane domains and is primarily expressed in the small intestine, where it facilitates the uptake of dietary zinc. This protein is part of the LIV-1 subfamily of ZIP transporters, which are essential for various physiological processes, including enzyme function, immune response, and cellular growth. The regulation of ZIP4 is tightly controlled by zinc levels, with the protein undergoing endocytosis and degradation when zinc is abundant, and accumulating on the cell surface under zinc-deficient conditions. Mutations in the SLC39A4 gene can lead to acrodermatitis enteropathica, a disorder marked by severe zinc deficiency due to impaired zinc absorption (Maverakis2007Acrodermatitis; Bafaro2017The; Hoch2020Elucidating).

## Structure
The SLC39A4 gene encodes the ZIP4 protein, a zinc transporter characterized by its structure comprising eight transmembrane domains (TMDs) with both N- and C-termini facing the extracytoplasmic side (Hoch2020Elucidating). A histidine-rich domain is located in the cytoplasmic loop between TMDs 3 and 4, although its precise function remains unclear (Hoch2020Elucidating). TMDs 4 and 5 are conserved and amphipathic, potentially forming a cavity for ion transport, which is crucial for its function as an H+/Zn2+ co-transporter (Hoch2020Elucidating).

The protein is approximately 68 kDa in size and consists of 647 amino acids (Schmitt2009An). ZIP4 is part of the LIV-1 subfamily of ZIP transporters, which share a highly conserved structure essential for zinc homeostasis (Schmitt2009An). The protein undergoes rapid endocytosis upon exposure to zinc and is cleaved into a shorter peptide under zinc deficiency (Hoch2020Elucidating).

Mutations in the SLC39A4 gene, such as P200L and G539R, affect the transport activity of ZIP4, with the G539R variant disrupting pH activation and transport due to its proximity to the catalytic core formed by TMDs 4 and 5 (Hoch2020Elucidating). These structural features are critical for the protein's function and regulation.

## Function
The SLC39A4 gene encodes the ZIP4 protein, a critical zinc transporter involved in the uptake of dietary zinc in the gastrointestinal tract, particularly in the small intestine. ZIP4 is localized to the apical surface of enterocytes, where it facilitates zinc absorption, essential for numerous physiological functions such as enzyme activity, immune response, and cellular growth (Meftah2006A; Bafaro2017The). 

ZIP4's activity is tightly regulated by zinc levels. Under zinc-deficient conditions, ZIP4 accumulates on the cell surface to enhance zinc uptake. Conversely, when zinc is abundant, ZIP4 undergoes endocytosis and degradation, a process mediated by a histidine-rich cluster in its cytoplasmic loop, which is crucial for zinc-stimulated ubiquitination (Mao2007A). This regulation ensures zinc homeostasis, preventing both deficiency and toxicity (Mao2007A).

Mutations in SLC39A4 can lead to acrodermatitis enteropathica, a condition characterized by severe zinc deficiency due to impaired zinc absorption, highlighting the gene's essential role in maintaining zinc balance in healthy human cells (Kambe2021Zinc; Kambe2015The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC39A4 gene are primarily associated with acrodermatitis enteropathica (AE), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe zinc deficiency. This condition results from impaired zinc absorption due to defective zinc transporter protein ZIP4, encoded by SLC39A4. AE manifests with symptoms such as dermatitis, alopecia, diarrhea, growth retardation, and immune dysfunction (Maverakis2007Acrodermatitis; Hua2022Case; Küry2003Mutation).

The disorder typically presents in infancy and can lead to severe complications if untreated. The incidence of AE is approximately 1 in 500,000 children worldwide, with a higher prevalence in regions with higher consanguinity, such as the Mediterranean basin (Maverakis2007Acrodermatitis; Küry2015Clinical). Over 52 mutations in the SLC39A4 gene have been identified, including missense, nonsense, splice site, and frameshift mutations, distributed across the gene's 12 exons (Küry2011Clinical; Hua2022Case).

Diagnosis of AE involves clinical evaluation, low plasma zinc levels, and genetic testing for SLC39A4 mutations. Treatment requires lifelong zinc supplementation, as discontinuation can lead to symptom relapse (Wang2008A; Hua2022Case). Despite the identification of many mutations, only about 50% of AE patients show genetic alterations in SLC39A4, suggesting other genetic or environmental factors may contribute to the disease (Ricci2015Heterogeneity).
