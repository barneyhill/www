# CCDC141

## Overview
CCDC141 is a gene that encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 141 protein, which plays a pivotal role in cellular processes, particularly in cell migration and centrosome function. The protein is categorized as a centrosomal protein due to its involvement in the stabilization and orientation of the centrosome, a critical cellular structure for cell division and migration. CCDC141 enhances the acetylation of α-tubulin by inhibiting HDAC6, a deacetylase enzyme, thereby promoting proper centrosome function and facilitating cell migration. This protein is also crucial in the development of the central nervous system, influencing the migration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons and olfactory axons, which are essential for normal pubertal development and reproductive health (Saengkaew2021Whole).

## Function
The CCDC141 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in cell migration by influencing the positioning and orientation of the centrosome. This protein enhances the acetylation of α-tubulin in the centrosome, which is essential for its stabilization and effective cell migration. CCDC141 achieves this by inhibiting the activity of HDAC6, a deacetylase enzyme of α-tubulin, thereby facilitating proper centrosome function and cell migration in healthy cells (Saengkaew2021Whole).

In healthy human cells, CCDC141 is associated with the pericentrin localization of acetylated tubulin, indicating its role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of centrosomes. Cells expressing wild-type CCDC141 exhibit increased migration rates compared to those with mutant variants, underscoring its importance in facilitating normal cell movement (Saengkaew2021Whole).

CCDC141 is also involved in the development of the cortical architecture of the central nervous system, particularly in the migration of GnRH neurons and olfactory axons. Its presence at the centrosome is critical for its function, and mis-localization can lead to abnormal cell migration. This gene's function is significant for the proper pacing of pubertal onset, affecting the development of the GnRH neuroendocrine network (Saengkaew2021Whole).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CCDC141 gene have been associated with several conditions related to delayed puberty and reproductive health. Notably, deleterious variants in CCDC141 are linked to familial self-limited delayed puberty, a condition characterized by a delayed onset of puberty that often follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. These mutations are thought to impair the migration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons, which are crucial for the development of the GnRH neuroendocrine network, leading to delayed pubertal timing (Saengkaew2021Whole).

The CCDC141 gene is also implicated in idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) and Kallmann syndrome (KS), conditions associated with abnormal neuronal cell migration. These disorders are characterized by delayed or absent puberty and, in the case of KS, olfactory defects. Mutations in CCDC141 can lead to abnormal subcellular distribution of acetylated tubulin, affecting centrosome stabilization and cell migration, which are critical for normal neuronal development (Saengkaew2021Whole).

The spectrum of phenotypes resulting from CCDC141 mutations can range from self-limited delayed puberty to more severe forms like IHH, depending on the severity of the genetic defect (Saengkaew2021Whole).

## Interactions
CCDC141, also known as CAMDI, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. It interacts with HDAC6, a histone deacetylase, specifically binding to the DD2 domain of HDAC6. This interaction is significant in the regulation of HDAC6 activity, which is involved in various cellular processes, including protein degradation pathways and the deacetylation of non-histone proteins (Bahram2024A).

In the context of cardiac hypertrophy, CCDC141 interacts with TTN, a gene associated with cardiac structure and function. This interaction is confirmed through network analysis using transcriptomic data from human hearts, showing strong connectivity in healthy hearts that weakens in heart failure (Wang2023Epistasis).

CCDC141 also plays a role in neuronal development, affecting radial migration through interactions with DISC1 and myosin II, which are involved in centrosome positioning. This interaction is crucial for the proper distribution of dopaminergic neurons, as demonstrated in zebrafish models (Jiang2022Genomewide). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of CCDC141 in various cellular and physiological processes.
