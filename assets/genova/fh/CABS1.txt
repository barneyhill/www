# CABS1

## Overview
CABS1 is a gene that encodes the calcium-binding protein, spermatid-associated 1 (hCABS1), which is characterized as an intrinsically disordered protein. This lack of stable tertiary structure allows hCABS1 to engage in dynamic interactions essential for its diverse roles in cellular processes. The protein is primarily involved in calcium signaling, which is crucial for sperm motility and fertilization, and is expressed in various tissues, including the salivary glands, where it may exert anti-inflammatory effects. hCABS1 is associated with energy metabolism, localizing to mitochondria and interacting with cofactors such as thiamine diphosphate, suggesting a role in metabolic pathways. The protein's ability to undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and proteolytic processing, further underscores its involvement in stress response and immunoinflammation (St.2015Calciumbinding; Kawashima2009CABS1; Marcet‐Palacios2020Structural).

## Structure
The human calcium-binding protein, spermatid-associated 1 (hCABS1), is characterized as an intrinsically disordered protein, lacking a stable tertiary structure, which allows for flexibility and dynamic interactions crucial for its function (Marcet‐Palacios2020Structural). The protein's primary structure includes a high proportion of acidic amino acids, contributing to its disordered nature and affecting its migration during electrophoresis (Marcet‐Palacios2020Structural). 

In terms of secondary structure, predictions indicate minimal secondary structure with specific regions appearing as random coils. An α-helix motif is predicted at the carboxyl terminal, coinciding with the anti-inflammatory motif TDIFELL (Marcet‐Palacios2020Structural). The protein also contains potential binding sites for ions such as Ca2+, Mg2+, and Zn2+, and cofactors like thiamine diphosphate (TPP), suggesting roles in energy metabolism and mitochondrial localization (Marcet‐Palacios2020Structural).

Post-translational modifications of hCABS1 include phosphorylation, which is crucial for its secretion and may regulate its functions in stress and immunoinflammation (Marcet‐Palacios2020Structural). The protein is also subject to proteolytic processing, with neutrophil elastase identified as a significant candidate for cleavage (Marcet‐Palacios2020Structural). These modifications and interactions suggest a complex role for hCABS1 in cellular processes.

## Function
The CABS1 gene encodes a calcium-binding protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in stress response and energy metabolism. In healthy human cells, CABS1 is involved in calcium signaling, which is crucial for sperm motility and fertilizing activity, as it localizes to the principal piece of mature sperm in the cauda epididymis (Kawashima2009CABS1). The protein is also expressed in human salivary glands, where it contains an anti-inflammatory motif similar to that found in the rat SMR1 protein, suggesting potential anti-inflammatory properties (St.2015Calciumbinding).

CABS1 is intrinsically disordered, which may facilitate its proteolytic processing, producing bioactive fragments with anti-inflammatory properties (Marcet‐Palacios2020Structural). It is predicted to have calcium-binding sites that influence its proteolytic degradation and structural stability, playing a role in stress, immunoinflammation, and physiology (Marcet‐Palacios2020Structural). The protein is also associated with energy metabolism, localizing to mitochondria, flagella, and the acrosome in sperm, indicating a role in energy supply (Marcet‐Palacios2020Structural). CABS1's expression in salivary glands and its potential anti-inflammatory activity suggest it may modulate inflammatory responses in human tissues (St.2015Calciumbinding).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the CABS1 gene have been linked to several reproductive and physiological conditions. In male fertility, CABS1 is crucial for proper sperm tail assembly and motility. Knockout studies in mice have shown that the absence of CABS1 leads to significant defects in sperm flagellar differentiation, resulting in abnormal sperm morphology, such as bent tails, and subfertility (Omolaoye2022Using). These structural abnormalities are attributed to disruptions in the midpiece-principal piece junction of the sperm tail, which are essential for normal sperm function.

CABS1 also plays a role in maintaining the balance of metabolites and lipids crucial for sperm function. In CABS1-deficient mice, alterations in the epididymal microenvironment, particularly in metabolites like carnitine and prostaglandins, have been observed. These changes are associated with decreased ATP levels in sperm, leading to reduced motility and an inflammatory state in the epididymis, which further affects sperm function (Zhao2024The).

Beyond reproductive health, CABS1 has been identified as a potential biomarker for stress and inflammation in humans. Its presence in saliva and association with stress indicators suggest a role in the body's response to psychological stress, potentially involving anti-inflammatory activities (Ritz2017A; Marcet‐Palacios2020Structural).

## Interactions
The human calcium-binding protein, spermatid-associated 1 (hCABS1), is involved in various interactions that suggest distinct functional roles depending on its localization. Intracellularly, hCABS1 is associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane and interacts with cofactors such as leucine, magnesium (Mg2+), calcium (Ca2+), zinc (Zn2+), and thiamine diphosphate (TPP). These interactions are believed to enhance hCABS1's role in regulating energy metabolism and intracellular stress pathways (Marcet‐Palacios2020Structural). The protein is intrinsically disordered, which may facilitate its proteolytic processing by enzymes like neutrophil elastase, producing bioactive fragments with potential physiological effects (Marcet‐Palacios2020Structural).

hCABS1 is also predicted to bind TPP, suggesting novel intracellular roles in energy metabolism. The protein may interact with enzymes involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, pyruvate metabolism, and branched-chain amino acid catabolism, which require TPP as a cofactor (Marcet‐Palacios2020Structural). The structure of hCABS1 indicates potential binding sites for Ca2+ and Mg2+, necessary for enzyme activation, and leucine, which could act as an allosteric regulator (Marcet‐Palacios2020Structural). These interactions highlight the multifaceted roles of hCABS1 in cellular and physiological contexts.
