# POLD1

## Overview
The POLD1 gene encodes the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase delta, known as DNA polymerase delta 1, catalytic subunit. This enzyme is a critical component of the DNA replication and repair machinery in eukaryotic cells. As a member of the polymerase family, it plays a pivotal role in synthesizing the lagging strand during DNA replication and is involved in various DNA repair pathways, including mismatch repair and homologous recombination. The protein encoded by POLD1, often referred to as Pol δ, is a heterotetramer that includes three accessory subunits, which together ensure high fidelity in DNA synthesis and contribute to genomic stability (Tumini2016Roles; Prindle2012DNA). Mutations in POLD1 have been linked to several clinical conditions, including familial colorectal cancer and mandibular hypoplasia, deafness, progeroid features, and lipodystrophy (MDPL) syndrome, highlighting its significance in human health (Bellido2016POLE; Sasaki2018Definitive).

## Structure
The POLD1 gene encodes the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase delta, a key enzyme in DNA replication and repair. The protein is a part of the Pol δ holoenzyme, which is a heterotetramer composed of a catalytic subunit (p125) and three accessory subunits (p50, p68, and p12) (Shen2019The). The core structure of PolD1 includes two adjacent functional domains: the exonuclease and polymerase catalytic domains, which are essential for its nuclear functions (Shen2019The). 

PolD1 contains nuclear localization signals (NLSs) at the amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal regions, which are crucial for its nuclear import (Shen2019The). These NLSs are structurally disordered sequences that form extended configurations upon binding to importins, facilitating nuclear import (Shen2019The). The middle region of PolD1, part of an α-helix involved in DNA clasping, does not function as an NLS (Shen2019The).

The protein shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm, with its export from the nucleus being CRM1-dependent (Shen2019The). This nucleocytoplasmic transport is regulated by importins and exportins, influenced by the Ran GTPase cycle (Shen2019The). The study of PolD1's transport mechanisms provides insights into its regulatory functions (Shen2019The).

## Function
The POLD1 gene encodes the catalytic subunit p125 of DNA polymerase delta (Pol δ), a crucial enzyme in DNA replication and repair in eukaryotic cells. Pol δ is primarily responsible for synthesizing the lagging strand during DNA replication, working in conjunction with other polymerases and associated factors to ensure high fidelity in DNA synthesis, which is essential for maintaining genomic stability and preventing genetic defects and malignancies (Tumini2016Roles; Prindle2012DNA). 

Pol δ possesses 3' to 5' exonuclease activity, allowing it to remove incorrectly incorporated nucleotides, thereby enhancing replication accuracy (Prindle2012DNA). It is also involved in several DNA repair pathways, including mismatch repair (MMR), where it corrects base substitution errors and frameshifts that escape initial proofreading (Prindle2012DNA). 

In addition to its role in replication, POLD1 is involved in DNA double-strand break repair via homologous recombination and acts as a major gap-filling polymerase in DNA repair synthesis (Tumini2016Roles). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it ensures proper cell cycle progression and DNA damage repair, contributing to overall genome stability and preventing conditions that could lead to cancer (Song2015Human; Tumini2016Roles).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the POLD1 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily due to its role in DNA replication and repair. Pathogenic variants in POLD1, particularly those affecting the exonuclease domain, are linked to familial colorectal cancer (CRC) and polyposis. Specific mutations such as p.D316H, p.D316G, p.R409W, and p.L474P have been identified as likely pathogenic, with carriers often diagnosed with CRC, endometrial, and breast cancers (Bellido2016POLE). These mutations are associated with a phenotype characterized by attenuated or oligo-adenomatous colorectal polyposis and possibly brain tumors (Bellido2016POLE).

POLD1 mutations also cause mandibular hypoplasia, deafness, progeroid features, and lipodystrophy (MDPL) syndrome. This rare disorder is characterized by features of premature aging and metabolic abnormalities, such as insulin resistance and lipodystrophy. The p.Ser605del mutation in POLD1 is a known hotspot for MDPL syndrome, leading to a loss of polymerase activity and replication stress (Sasaki2018Definitive; Elouej2017Exome).

Additionally, POLD1 mutations have been implicated in combined immunodeficiency, where a loss-of-function mutation results in compromised immune function (Cui2020Combined). These diverse clinical manifestations underscore the critical role of POLD1 in maintaining genomic stability.

## Interactions
POLD1, the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase delta, plays a crucial role in DNA replication and repair through its interactions with various proteins and nucleic acids. It directly interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) via a noncanonical PCNA-interacting protein (PIP) motif, which is essential for enhancing the enzyme's activity and processivity (Fuchs2021Underappreciated). This interaction increases the activity of POLD1 tenfold in vitro (Fuchs2021Underappreciated).

POLD1 also coordinates a [4Fe-4S] cluster through its CysB motif, which is important for maintaining the structural integrity of the Pol δ holoenzyme. This cluster interacts with the phosphodiesterase-and oligonucleotide-binding domain of the accessory subunit POLD2 and the exonuclease and thumb domain of POLD1 itself, forming a compact structure that enhances enzyme activity and fidelity (Fuchs2021Underappreciated).

In addition to its interactions with PCNA, POLD1 is part of a complex with other subunits, including POLD2, POLD3, and POLD4. These interactions are crucial for the coordination of DNA replication and repair processes, such as Okazaki fragment maturation (Fuchs2021Underappreciated). POLD1's interactions with POLD3 are particularly important for translesion synthesis (TLS) activity, especially in POLD3-deficient cells (Fuchs2021Underappreciated).
