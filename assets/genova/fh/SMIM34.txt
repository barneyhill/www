# SMIM34

## Overview
SMIM34 is a gene that encodes the small integral membrane protein 34, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions and interactions are still under investigation. As a transmembrane protein, it is likely to play a role in cellular signaling or transport across the cell membrane. The gene and its encoded protein have been subjects of interest due to their potential implications in health and disease, although detailed mechanisms and pathways remain to be fully elucidated. Further research is needed to understand the precise biological roles and clinical significance of SMIM34 and its protein product.
