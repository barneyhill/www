# RCOR1

## Overview
RCOR1, or REST corepressor 1, is a gene located on chromosome 14 that encodes a transcriptional corepressor protein involved in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. The protein, also referred to as CoREST1, is characterized by its ELM2 and SANT domains, which facilitate interactions with histone deacetylases and lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), forming the LSD1-CoREST-HDAC complex. This complex plays a pivotal role in gene repression by modifying histone tails, thereby influencing chromatin structure and transcriptional activity (Maksour2020More; Yang2006Structural). RCOR1 is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it modulates transcriptional processes and is involved in neurodevelopment by repressing neuronal genes in non-neuronal cells (Maksour2020More; Rivera2022Unveiling). The protein's interactions and regulatory functions have significant implications in various physiological and pathological contexts, including cancer, immune responses, and inflammatory conditions (Xiong2020Inhibiting; Ji2023Novel).

## Structure
RCOR1, also known as REST Corepressor 1 or CoREST1, is a protein encoded by a 12-exon gene located on chromosome 14, producing a 53-kDa protein composed of 485 amino acids (Maksour2020More). The protein structure includes several key domains: an ELM2 domain and two SANT domains. The ELM2 domain acts as a protein-binding site, crucial for recruiting histone deacetylases HDAC1/2 and interacting with LSD1 (Maksour2020More; Yang2006Structural). The SANT2 domain is essential for DNA binding and facilitates the interaction of the RCOR1-LSD1 complex with nucleosomal DNA, playing a critical role in histone demethylation (Yang2006Structural; Pilotto2015Interplay).

RCOR1 forms a complex with LSD1 and HDAC1/2, known as the LSD1-CoREST-HDAC (LCH) complex, which is involved in gene repression by deacetylating and demethylating histone tails (Maksour2020More). The protein's structure is essential for nucleosomal demethylation and gene repression independent of REST (Maksour2020More). RCOR1 also contains conserved coiled-coil domains, which may contribute to its unique functions (Maksour2020More). The SANT2 domain's interaction with DNA is crucial for the repressive activity of RCOR1, as demonstrated by the lack of repressive activity in CoREST3 variants missing this domain (Pilotto2015Interplay).

## Function
RCOR1, also known as REST corepressor 1, functions as a transcriptional corepressor in healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in modulating chromatin structure to regulate gene expression. RCOR1 forms complexes with LSD1 (lysine-specific demethylase 1A) and HDAC1/2 (histone deacetylases), which are crucial for erasing transcriptionally permissive histone modifications, such as acetylation and methylation, thereby repressing gene expression (You2001CoREST; Rivera2022Unveiling).

RCOR1 is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it is enriched in euchromatin regions, indicating its role in transcriptionally active chromatin. It interacts with RNA Polymerase II (RNA POL-II) and is involved in regulating transcriptional processes, such as pause-release and elongation, by deacetylating the carboxy-terminal domain of POL-II at lysine 7 (Rivera2022Unveiling). This interaction suggests that RCOR1 acts as a transcriptional rheostat, modulating the transcriptional activity of highly expressed genes (Rivera2022Unveiling).

RCOR1 also plays a significant role in neurodevelopment by forming complexes with REST and other corepressors to repress neuronal gene expression in non-neuronal cells, contributing to chromatin condensation and gene repression (Maksour2020More).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the RCOR1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In cancer, RCOR1 is involved in the regulation of immune responses and tumor growth. Deletion of RCOR1 in regulatory T cells (Tregs) impairs their suppressive function, leading to enhanced antitumor immunity and reduced tumor growth, as observed in lung tumor models (Xiong2020Inhibiting). In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), RCOR1 deletions are recurrent and associated with poor survival outcomes, serving as a prognostic biomarker (chan2017clinical). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), RCOR1 expression is higher in tumor tissues, and its knockdown inhibits cell viability, suggesting its role in tumorigenesis (Zheng2023Comprehensive).

RCOR1 is also linked to inflammatory conditions such as gout. Genetic studies have identified significant variants in RCOR1 associated with gout, indicating its involvement in immune processes rather than urate homeostasis. Higher RCOR1 expression is associated with increased inflammation in gout (Ji2023Novel). Additionally, RCOR1 has been implicated in tinnitus, with genetic variations near the RCOR1 locus suggesting a potential role in this condition (Wells2021Genomewide). These findings highlight the diverse clinical significance of RCOR1 in various diseases.

## Interactions
RCOR1 (REST corepressor 1) is involved in several protein interactions that play a crucial role in transcriptional regulation. It forms a complex with LSD1 (lysine-specific demethylase 1) and HDAC1/2 (histone deacetylases), which is enriched in euchromatin and associated with transcriptionally active genes. This complex is involved in erasing transcriptionally permissive histone modifications, such as H3K4me3 and H3K9ac, and deacetylating the C-terminal domain of RNA Polymerase II (POL-II) at lysine 7, thereby repressing transcription (Rivera2022Unveiling).

RCOR1 also interacts with RNA POL-II, particularly with its largest subunit, RPB1, during transcription. This interaction occurs after the formation of the pre-initiation complex and before the elongation phase, suggesting a role in modulating transcriptional dynamics (Rivera2022Unveiling). Additionally, RCOR1 is part of a complex with ZNF750, KLF4, and other chromatin regulators, which represses epidermal progenitor genes and induces differentiation genes, highlighting its role in epidermal differentiation (Boxer2014ZNF750).

The interaction between RCOR1 and LSD1 is evolutionarily conserved, with key amino acids involved in their interaction being highly conserved, indicating their importance in molecular complex formation (OlivaresCosta2023Evolution).
