# RBMS1

## Overview
RBMS1 (RNA binding motif single stranded interacting protein 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, primarily through its role as an RNA-binding protein. The RBMS1 protein is characterized by its ability to bind single-stranded DNA and RNA, influencing DNA replication, transcription, and mRNA stability. It is categorized as a nuclear single-stranded DNA binding protein, with significant functions in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. The protein is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and regulating cell cycle progression, thereby playing a vital role in cell growth and homeostasis. RBMS1's interactions with other RNA-binding proteins and its involvement in post-transcriptional regulation underscore its importance in normal cellular function and response to environmental changes (Dankert2020Loss; Yu2020RBMS1).

## Function
RBMS1 (RNA binding motif single stranded interacting protein 1) is a gene that encodes a nuclear single-stranded DNA binding protein involved in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, RBMS1 plays a crucial role in DNA replication and transcription, as well as in the regulation of mRNA degradation and translation (Dankert2020Loss). It is known to bind to enhancer elements of the proto-oncogene MYC, which is essential for cell proliferation and apoptosis (Hubberten2018Linear). RBMS1 is also implicated in cell cycle progression and maintaining genomic stability, suggesting its involvement in regulating cell growth and homeostasis (Dankert2020Loss).

RBMS1 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it influences cell proliferation and differentiation (Dankert2020Loss). It interacts with AU-rich elements (AREs) in mRNAs, directing mRNA degradation, which is important for controlling the levels of transcripts that could otherwise contribute to tumor formation and progression (Dankert2020Loss). The protein's ability to stabilize specific mRNA regulons further highlights its role in post-transcriptional regulation, which is vital for normal cellular function and response to environmental changes (Yu2020RBMS1).

## Clinical Significance
RBMS1 has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in regulating mRNA stability and gene expression. In colorectal cancer, the loss of RBMS1 is associated with poor prognosis and increased metastatic potential. This is attributed to decreased expression of target genes such as the tumor suppressor AKAP12 and the WNT pathway interacting protein SDCBP, leading to oncogenic gene expression programs (Carter2020Loss). In prostate cancer, RBMS1 acts as a tumor suppressor, and its expression is downregulated by the oncogenic microRNA miR-106b. This downregulation contributes to increased cell proliferation and tumor progression (Dankert2020Loss).

In gastric cancer, RBMS1 is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis, promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis (Liu2022RBMS1). In lung cancer, RBMS1 regulates ferroptosis through the translational control of SLC7A11, with its overexpression linked to radiotherapy resistance and cancer progression (Zhang2021RBMS1). Additionally, RBMS1 is involved in adipogenesis and adipocyte metabolism, with its expression linked to obesity and type 2 diabetes (Dairi2023Transcriptomic). These findings suggest that RBMS1 plays a significant role in cancer progression and metabolic disorders.

## Interactions
RBMS1 is known to interact with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It interacts with RNA-binding proteins such as PABPC1 and ELAVL1, which predominantly bind to the 3' UTRs of mRNAs. The interaction between RBMS1 and these proteins is RNA-dependent, with ELAVL1 binding to A/U-rich elements (AREs) in the 3' UTRs. This interaction is crucial for increasing mRNA stability, as demonstrated by the downregulation of RBMS1 targets upon ELAVL1 knockdown in colon cancer cells (Yu2020RBMS1a).

RBMS1 also interacts with the long noncoding RNA CDKN2B-AS1, binding to both long and short polyadenylated splice variants. This interaction is independent of CDKN2B-AS1 mRNA binding to RBMS1 protein, suggesting a distinct regulatory mechanism (Hubberten2018Linear).

In lung cancer, RBMS1 interacts with the translation initiation factor eIF3d, bridging the 3′ and 5′ UTRs of the SLC7A11 gene, which is crucial for its translation and the regulation of ferroptosis (Zhang2021RBMS1). RBMS1 also interacts with other components of the eIF3 complex, such as eIF3i and eIF3m, which are involved in translation initiation (Zhang2021RBMS1).
