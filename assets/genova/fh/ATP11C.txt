# ATP11C

## Overview
ATP11C is a gene that encodes the ATPase phospholipid transporting 11C protein, a member of the P4-ATPase family, which functions as a phospholipid flippase. This protein plays a crucial role in maintaining the asymmetric distribution of phospholipids across the plasma membrane by translocating phosphatidylserine (PS) from the outer to the inner leaflet in an ATP-dependent manner. The ATP11C protein is characterized by several transmembrane domains and requires association with the accessory subunit CDC50A for proper localization and function. It is expressed in various tissues and is particularly important in erythrocytes, where it contributes to membrane stability and prevents premature cell clearance. Mutations in the ATP11C gene are linked to congenital hemolytic anemia and defects in B-cell maturation, underscoring its significance in both hematological and immune system functions (Takada2015ATP11C; Arashiki2016ATP11C; Arashiki2019ATP11C).

## Structure
The ATP11C protein is a member of the P4-ATPase family, which functions as a phospholipid flippase involved in the translocation of phospholipids across the plasma membrane. The primary structure of ATP11C consists of 1132 amino acids, forming a protein with a molecular weight of approximately 130 kDa (Andrew2004Xlinked). The protein includes several transmembrane domains, notably TM2, TM4, and TM6, which form a crevice that serves as a conduit for phospholipid transport (Nakanishi2020Crystal).

The secondary structure of ATP11C includes alpha helices, particularly in the transmembrane regions, which are crucial for its function as a flippase (Nakanishi2020Crystal). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices to create a hydrophobic cavity that facilitates phospholipid movement (Liou2019Identification).

ATP11C forms a quaternary structure by assembling with the accessory subunit CDC50A, which is essential for its proper localization and function at the plasma membrane (Nakanishi2020Crystal). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which may regulate its activity. ATP11C also has multiple isoforms resulting from alternative splicing, affecting the carboxy-termini of the protein (Andrew2004Xlinked).

## Function
ATP11C is a crucial flippase enzyme in human cells, primarily involved in maintaining the asymmetric distribution of phospholipids, particularly phosphatidylserine (PS), across the plasma membrane. This enzyme actively translocates PS from the outer to the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer in an ATP-dependent manner, a process essential for various cellular functions, including membrane stability and cell signaling (Arashiki2016ATP11C; Arashiki2019ATP11C). In erythrocytes, ATP11C's activity is vital for maintaining membrane deformability and stability, which are critical for the cells' passage through narrow capillaries and preventing PS exposure that signals phagocytosis by macrophages (Arashiki2016ATP11C; Arashiki2019ATP11C).

ATP11C is expressed in almost all tissues and contributes significantly to the flippase activity in human erythrocytes, ensuring the structural integrity and lifespan of these cells (Arashiki2019ATP11C). The protein requires association with CDC50A for proper folding, targeting, and activity facilitation (Arashiki2019ATP11C). In polarized cells, ATP11C-b, a splice variant, localizes to specific regions of the plasma membrane, suggesting a role in regulating PS distribution in these areas (Takayama2019The). ATP11C's function is crucial for preventing conditions like congenital hemolytic anemia, which can arise from mutations affecting its activity (Arashiki2016ATP11C).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATP11C gene are associated with congenital hemolytic anemia, an X-linked recessive condition characterized by the premature destruction of red blood cells. A specific mutation, ATP11C T418N, leads to a significant reduction in phosphatidylserine (PS) flippase activity due to improper membrane trafficking and increased proteasome degradation of the ATP11C protein. This results in the loss of flippase activity, causing improper PS distribution and subsequent erythrocyte phagocytosis by splenic macrophages, contributing to the symptoms of hemolytic anemia (Arashiki2016ATP11C; Arashiki2019ATP11C).

The ATP11C gene is also implicated in defects in B-cell maturation and anemia due to its role in maintaining phospholipid asymmetry in cellular membranes. A nonsense mutation in ATP11C has been identified in UPS-1 cells, leading to defects in PS uptake. This mutation results in the lack of functional ATP11C protein, causing the observed defect in PS flipping (Takada2015ATP11C).

These mutations and alterations in ATP11C expression highlight its critical role in erythrocyte membrane stability and immune system function, with deficiencies leading to significant clinical conditions.

## Interactions
ATP11C interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in its function and localization. A significant interaction is with ezrin, a member of the ERM (ezrin, radixin, moesin) protein family. This interaction is essential for the polarized localization of ATP11C-b at the plasma membrane, particularly in regions enriched with F-actin, such as the uropod in polarized B lymphocytes and the cell body in motile cells like MDA-MB-231. The LLxY motif in the C-terminal cytoplasmic region of ATP11C-b is critical for binding to the FERM domain of ezrin, specifically its F1 and F2 subdomains (Inoue2021The).

ATP11C-b's interaction with ezrin is not required for its enzymatic activity but is crucial for its proper localization. In cells where ezrin or other ERM proteins are depleted, ATP11C-b becomes mislocalized, indicating the importance of these interactions for maintaining cell polarity (Inoue2021The). ATP11C also interacts with CDC50A, a beta-subunit necessary for its function and plasma membrane localization, which is crucial for its role in phosphatidylserine flipping (Takada2015ATP11C).
