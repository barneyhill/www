# CDC42EP4

## Overview
CDC42EP4 is a gene that encodes the CDC42 effector protein 4, a member of the Borg family of proteins, which are known to interact with small GTPases such as Cdc42. This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, influencing various cellular processes including cell shape, motility, and cytoskeletal organization. CDC42 effector protein 4 is particularly significant in the central nervous system, where it is involved in the formation of perisynaptic glial scaffolds that are essential for glutamate clearance in the cerebellum, thereby contributing to synaptic function and motor coordination (Farrugia2016The; AgetaIshihara2015A). Additionally, CDC42EP4 is implicated in lysosomal protein sorting and has been associated with several neurological and psychiatric conditions, as well as certain cancers, highlighting its diverse functional roles and clinical significance (Datta2015Altered; Tomasso2024Cdc42EP3bound).

## Function
CDC42EP4, also known as CDC42 effector protein 4, plays a significant role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and is involved in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, CDC42EP4 interacts with septin hetero-oligomers and the glutamate transporter GLAST, forming a perisynaptic glial scaffold that is crucial for efficient glutamate clearance in the cerebellum. This interaction helps maintain the localization and function of GLAST at synapses, which is essential for proper synaptic function and motor coordination (AgetaIshihara2015A).

CDC42EP4 is primarily expressed in Bergmann glia within the cerebellum, where it localizes beneath specific membrane domains and forms complexes with septins. These complexes modulate a subset of glutamate transporters, facilitating the perisynaptic localization of GLAST and optimizing glutamate buffering and clearance (Farrugia2016The; AgetaIshihara2015A).

In addition to its role in the brain, CDC42EP4 is involved in cytoskeletal organization and cell motility. It co-localizes with actin stress fibers and induces filopodia and stress fiber formation in mammary cells, suggesting its involvement in cell shape regulation and migration (Farrugia2016The). CDC42EP4 is also implicated in lysosomal protein sorting, as its knockdown causes mis-sorting of LAMP1 to the lysosome (Tomasso2024Cdc42EP3bound).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the CDC42EP4 gene have been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric conditions. In schizophrenia, there is an up-regulation of CDC42EP4 in cortical layer 3 pyramidal cells of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. This alteration is associated with dendritic spine abnormalities, which are thought to contribute to cognitive dysfunction in the disorder. The changes in CDC42EP4 expression are part of broader disruptions in the CDC42 signaling pathway, which affect the actin cytoskeleton and synaptic structure (Datta2015Altered).

In the cerebellum, CDC42EP4 is crucial for the proper localization of the glutamate transporter GLAST. Knockout studies in mice have shown that the absence of CDC42EP4 leads to impaired glutamate clearance, resulting in motor coordination and learning defects. These findings suggest that CDC42EP4 dysfunction could potentially contribute to conditions characterized by synaptic and motor coordination anomalies (AgetaIshihara2015A).

CDC42EP4 is also overexpressed in glioblastoma, where it may facilitate tumor progression by enhancing glutamate clearance from the tumor environment. This suggests a potential pro-tumorigenic role for CDC42EP4, although further research is needed to fully understand its implications in cancer (Tomasso2024Cdc42EP3bound).

## Interactions
CDC42EP4, also known as Borg4, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with the small GTPases Cdc42 and TC10/RhoQ through its CRIB domain, which is specific for active forms of these GTPases (Farrugia2016The). CDC42EP4 also binds to septin hetero-oligomers, including SEPT2, SEPT4, SEPT6, and SEPT7, forming complexes that are crucial for cytoskeletal organization and the localization of the glutamate transporter GLAST in the cerebellum (AgetaIshihara2015A).

In mammary epithelial cells, CDC42EP4 is phosphorylated by PKCα, which reduces its affinity for Cdc42, allowing it to bind to ARHGEF17 (TEM4). This interaction leads to Rac1 activation and promotes cell migration (Farrugia2016The). In the cerebellum, CDC42EP4 is essential for maintaining the perisynaptic localization of GLAST, facilitating efficient glutamate clearance. The absence of CDC42EP4 results in GLAST mislocalization and impaired glutamate buffering (AgetaIshihara2015A).

CDC42EP4 also interacts with MYH10, a nonmuscle myosin, influencing cell spreading and cytoskeletal dynamics. This interaction is part of a complex network involving septins and actin filaments (AgetaIshihara2018CDC42EP4).
