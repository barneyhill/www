# FABP3

## Overview
Fatty acid-binding protein 3 (FABP3) is a gene that encodes a member of the fatty acid-binding protein family, specifically known as heart-type fatty acid-binding protein. The protein product of FABP3 is a cytosolic lipid chaperone that plays a crucial role in the intracellular transport and metabolism of long-chain fatty acids, particularly in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues. Structurally, the protein is characterized by a beta-barrel motif that forms a ligand-binding cavity, facilitating the binding and transport of fatty acids. FABP3 is involved in various physiological processes, including energy homeostasis and lipid metabolism, and has been implicated in several pathological conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, and neurodegenerative disorders. Its expression and function are influenced by factors such as exercise, circadian rhythms, and epigenetic modifications, making it a potential biomarker for myocardial infarction and other health conditions (Sepe2018Role; Furuhashi2008Fatty; Zhuang2021FABP3; Li2022The; Chmurzyńska2006The).

## Structure
The human fatty acid-binding protein 3 (FABP3) is a cytosolic protein primarily involved in the transport of fatty acids within cells. Its molecular structure is characterized by a sequence of 132 amino acids, forming a compact, globular shape. The secondary structure of FABP3 includes ten antiparallel beta strands that create a beta-barrel, which is a common feature among fatty acid-binding proteins (Zimmerman2002New; Hirose2013Structure). This beta-barrel structure houses a central ligand-binding cavity, which is crucial for its function in fatty acid transport (Zimmerman2002New).

The tertiary structure of FABP3 is stabilized by interactions between hydrophobic and polar amino acid side chains within the binding cavity, as well as by internal water molecules that contribute to protein stability and facilitate ligand binding (Zimmerman2002New). The binding pocket is capped by two alpha-helices, which include an N-terminal helix-turn-helix motif acting as a regulatory portal for fatty acid binding (Hirose2013Structure).

FABP3 does not typically form quaternary structures, as it functions as a monomer. Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may occur, although specific details are not provided in the context. The protein's structure allows it to bind fatty acids in a U-shaped conformation, with specific interactions involving the carboxylate group of the fatty acid and ordered water molecules (Zimmerman2002New).

## Function
FABP3, also known as heart-type fatty acid binding protein, is primarily expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle cells, where it plays a critical role in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. It functions as a lipid chaperone, facilitating the uptake and intracellular transport of long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) to the mitochondria for β-oxidation, a process that provides a significant portion of the energy required by muscle cells (Li2022The; Smathers2011The). This protein is involved in maintaining an intracellular pool of LCFAs, which serve as a fuel source, and protects cellular proteins and membranes from the toxicity of LCFAs and their derivatives (Zhang2013Fatty).

FABP3 is also implicated in the regulation of fatty acid uptake and intracellular transport, interacting with hydrophobic ligands and escorting them to sites of lipid metabolism such as the plasma membrane, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum (Chmurzyńska2006The; Li2022The). Its expression is influenced by factors such as exercise and circadian rhythms, and it is released into circulation following muscle injury, making it a potential biomarker for myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular diseases (Li2022The; Furuhashi2008Fatty).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the FABP3 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of metabolic syndrome (MetS), epigenetic modifications of FABP3, such as DNA CpG methylation, have been associated with key MetS traits, including plasma cholesterol levels, insulin sensitivity, and blood pressure. These modifications can influence FABP3 expression and are linked to adverse metabolic profiles, potentially impacting cardiovascular disease risk (Zhang2013Fatty).

In cardiac health, FABP3 deficiency is associated with exacerbated cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. This is due to impaired fatty acid oxidation and increased glycolysis, leading to metabolic derangement. FABP3 interacts with the PPARα pathway, and its deficiency results in toxic lipid accumulation and reduced ATP production, contributing to cardiac dysfunction (Zhuang2021FABP3).

FABP3 is also involved in neurodegenerative diseases. Elevated levels of FABP3 in cerebrospinal fluid have been observed in Alzheimer's disease and synucleinopathies, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for these conditions. Its interaction with tau proteins and involvement in amyloid plaque formation and neuroinflammation are areas of ongoing research (Sepe2018Role).

## Interactions
FABP3, or fatty acid binding protein 3, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It specifically binds to aptamers, which are oligonucleotide ligands, with high specificity and affinity. Two aptamers, N13 and N53, have been identified to bind FABP3 with dissociation constants of 0.0743 ± 0.0142 μM and 0.3337 ± 0.1485 μM, respectively. These interactions involve multiple hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and hydrophobic interactions, leading to conformational changes in FABP3, particularly with N53 (Kakoti2017Multifaceted).

FABP3 also interacts with the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) in the brain, which is associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. This interaction suggests a role for FABP3 in regulating emotional responses through fatty acid uptake and D2R interaction (Sepe2018Role).

In the context of metabolic syndrome, FABP3's expression is influenced by the methylation status of its promoter region, which affects its interaction with nuclear proteins. Methylated FABP3 promoter sequences have a higher binding affinity for nuclear proteins, potentially leading to gene repression (Zhang2013Fatty). These interactions highlight FABP3's role in lipid metabolism and its potential impact on various physiological and pathological processes.
