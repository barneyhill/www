# DNAAF11

## Overview
DNAAF11, or dynein axonemal assembly factor 11, is a gene that encodes a protein crucial for the assembly and function of dynein arms, which are integral to the motility of cilia. The protein encoded by DNAAF11 is involved in the later stages of dynein preassembly or transport within the cytoplasm, playing a significant role in the proper formation of axonemal dynein complexes necessary for ciliary movement (Wang2022FBB18; Smith2022The). Mutations in DNAAF11 are linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetic disorder that affects ciliary function, leading to respiratory issues, abnormal organ positioning, and infertility (Rumman2023The; Tinoco2023Primary). The gene's clinical significance is particularly noted in specific populations, where recurrent mutations have been identified, underscoring its importance in genetic diagnosis and potential therapeutic interventions (Rumman2023The).

## Function
DNAAF11, also known as LRRC6, is a crucial protein involved in the assembly and function of dynein arms, which are essential for the motility of cilia. In healthy human cells, DNAAF11 is hypothesized to play a significant role in the assembly of dynein arms within the cytoplasm before their transport into the ciliary axoneme via intraflagellar transport (IFT) (Smith2022The). This process is vital for the proper formation of axonemal dynein complexes, which are necessary for ciliary movement and function.

The protein is active in the cytoplasm, where it is involved in the later stages of dynein preassembly or transport. Despite the loss of dyneins in cilia, dynein heavy chains and outer dynein arm intermediate chains show normal abundance in the cytoplasm, suggesting DNAAF11's role in the transport or final assembly stages of dynein complexes rather than their initial folding or stabilization (Wang2022FBB18). Proper functioning of DNAAF11 is critical for respiratory health and fertility, as it affects ciliary motion in respiratory tracts and sperm cells, contributing to the overall motility and function of these structures (Smith2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DNAAF11 gene are associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetic disorder characterized by chronic respiratory tract infections, abnormal organ positioning, and infertility due to impaired ciliary movement. In the Palestinian population, a specific mutation, DNAAF11 c.436G>C, has been identified as recurrent, affecting multiple families and accounting for a significant portion of PCD diagnoses. This suggests a strong link between DNAAF11 mutations and PCD in this population, highlighting the potential for targeted genetic diagnosis in resource-limited settings (Rumman2023The).

In a study conducted in a Portuguese bronchiectasis outpatient clinic, DNAAF11 was among the genes analyzed for its role in PCD pathogenesis. The study found that a significant number of patients with confirmed PCD diagnoses had pathogenic variants in genes associated with the disorder, including DNAAF11 (Tinoco2023Primary).

The clinical significance of DNAAF11 mutations is underscored by the challenges in diagnosing PCD, particularly in regions with limited healthcare infrastructure. Identifying causative mutations in DNAAF11 can facilitate targeted mutation testing, potentially reducing the need for extensive diagnostic procedures (Rumman2023The).
