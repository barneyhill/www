# OPTN

## Overview
The OPTN gene encodes the protein optineurin, a multifunctional adaptor protein involved in various cellular processes, including autophagy, vesicle trafficking, and immune response regulation. Optineurin is characterized by several structural domains, such as coiled-coil domains, a leucine zipper, and an ubiquitin-binding UBAN domain, which facilitate its diverse functions (Li2018Structural; Li2016Structural). As a selective autophagy receptor, optineurin plays a critical role in mitophagy, maintaining mitochondrial quality and cellular homeostasis (Weil2018Role; Slowicka2018Optineurin). It also regulates NF-κB signaling and interacts with proteins like Rab8 and TBK1, highlighting its involvement in vesicle trafficking and immune modulation (Bansal2015Functional; Slowicka2018Optineurin). Mutations in the OPTN gene are linked to diseases such as primary open-angle glaucoma and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, underscoring its clinical significance in neurodegenerative conditions (Liu2018ALSAssociated; Weil2018Role).

## Structure
Optineurin (OPTN) is a protein characterized by several distinct structural domains that contribute to its function in cellular processes. The protein contains two coiled-coil domains, a leucine zipper, a canonical LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif, an ubiquitin-binding UBAN domain, and a C-terminal C2H2-type zinc finger (Li2018Structural; Li2016Structural). The N-terminal coiled-coil domain (NTD) of OPTN is crucial for its interaction with TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), forming a complex with the C-terminal domain (CTD) of TBK1. This interaction results in a symmetrical hetero-tetramer with a parallel four-helix bundle architecture (Li2016Structural).

The UBAN domain of OPTN preferentially binds to linear ubiquitin chains, forming a stable 2:1 stoichiometry complex with linear diubiquitin (DiUb[M1]). This domain adopts a crescent-shaped continuous alpha-helix, forming a parallel coiled-coil homodimer (Li2018Structural). Phosphorylation of the Ser473 residue enhances the UBAN domain's ability to bind ubiquitin proteins, which is crucial for its role in autophagic degradation (Li2018Structural).

Mutations in OPTN, such as E50K, can alter its interaction with TBK1, affecting the protein's oligomeric state and function (Li2016Structural). These structural features and modifications highlight OPTN's role in neurodegenerative diseases and autophagy.

## Function
Optineurin (OPTN) is a multifunctional adaptor protein involved in various cellular processes, including autophagy, vesicle trafficking, and immune response regulation. In healthy human cells, OPTN plays a crucial role in autophagy by acting as a selective autophagy receptor. It facilitates the degradation of damaged mitochondria through mitophagy, a process essential for maintaining mitochondrial quality and preventing the accumulation of defective mitochondria (Weil2018Role; Slowicka2018Optineurin). OPTN interacts with LC3 and ubiquitinated cargo, promoting the formation and maturation of autophagosomes, which are critical for cellular homeostasis (Qiu2021Emerging).

OPTN is also involved in vesicle trafficking and the maintenance of Golgi structure, interacting with proteins such as Rab8 and myosin VI to regulate transferrin receptor recycling and Golgi organization (Bansal2015Functional). It negatively regulates NF-κB signaling by competing with NEMO for binding to polyubiquitinated RIP, thus modulating inflammatory responses and apoptosis (Bansal2015Functional; Slowicka2018Optineurin). Additionally, OPTN is active in the cytoplasm and associated with cellular structures like the Golgi apparatus, endosomes, and mitochondria, highlighting its widespread role in cellular function (Ying2016Optineurin:).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the OPTN gene are associated with several diseases, most notably primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In POAG, mutations such as E50K and M98K are linked to retinal ganglion cell death, potentially through mechanisms involving impaired autophagy and mitophagy (Swarup2018Altered; Weil2018Role). The E50K mutation, in particular, is associated with inhibited autophagy and increased mitochondrial fission-mediated mitophagy, leading to cell death (Weil2018Role). This mutation also impairs Rab8-mediated vesicle trafficking, contributing to apoptosis of retinal cells (Swarup2018Altered).

In ALS, OPTN mutations such as E478G disrupt normal cellular signaling by abolishing the inhibitory effect on the NF-κB pathway, leading to increased inflammation and neuronal cell death (Liu2018ALSAssociated). These mutations are found in both familial and sporadic cases of ALS, with varying frequencies depending on ethnicity (Toth2018Dysfunction).

OPTN mutations are also implicated in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and potentially in other neurodegenerative diseases, where they may contribute to the formation of protein aggregates and autophagic defects (Shen2015Mutations; Pottier2015Wholegenome).

## Interactions
Optineurin (OPTN) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. OPTN interacts with TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), forming a complex that is important for selective autophagy. This interaction involves the N-terminal coiled-coil domain of OPTN and the C-terminal domain of TBK1, forming a symmetrical hetero-tetramer structure. Mutations in OPTN, such as E50K, can enhance its interaction with TBK1, altering its oligomeric state (Li2016Structural).

OPTN also interacts with Rab8, a small GTPase involved in vesicle trafficking. The E50K mutation in OPTN disrupts this interaction, leading to retinal degeneration in mice, which is significant in the context of glaucoma (Chi2010Overexpression). Additionally, OPTN's interaction with Rab1a is implicated in autophagosome formation, as demonstrated in neuroblastoma cells (Song2017Interaction).

In the TNFα signaling pathway, OPTN competes with NEMO for binding to polyubiquitinated RIP, inhibiting NF-κB activation. This competitive interaction is crucial for modulating NF-κB signaling in response to TNFα stimulation (Zhu2007Optineurin). These interactions highlight OPTN's multifaceted role in cellular homeostasis and disease mechanisms.
