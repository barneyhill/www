# EFHC2

## Overview
EFHC2 is a gene located on the X chromosome that encodes the EF-hand domain containing 2 protein, which is characterized by its calcium-binding EF-hand motifs and DM10 domains. This protein is primarily associated with ciliary function, particularly in motile cilia, where it acts as a microtubule inner protein (MIP) crucial for ciliary motility. The EFHC2 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including neuronal signaling and ciliary axoneme stability, as evidenced by studies in model organisms such as Chlamydomonas, Tetrahymena, and zebrafish (Cox2024Ancient; Barrodia2018EFhand). In humans, EFHC2 has been linked to neurological and psychiatric conditions, including anxiety-related traits and social cognitive abilities, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Blaya2009Preliminary; Startin2015Variation). Despite its involvement in these areas, EFHC2 does not appear to play a direct role in idiopathic generalized epilepsy (Berrin2016No).

## Structure
The EFHC2 gene encodes a protein consisting of 749 amino acids, located on chromosome Xp11.4. The protein features three DM10 domains and three calcium-binding EF-hand motifs. The DM10-1 domain spans amino acids 75-182, DM10-2 is between 226-368, and DM10-3 is located at 431-538. The EF-hand domain is situated between amino acids 558-593 (Berrin2016No). 

Alternative splicing of the EFHC2 gene results in two isoforms. The second isoform is a truncated version, consisting of 162 amino acids and lacking the first 587 amino acids of the full-length protein (Berrin2016No). 

The EFHC2 protein is implicated in calcium binding, which may influence neuronal and intracellular signaling pathways (Startin2015Variation). Although specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not provided, the presence of EF-hand motifs suggests a role in calcium-mediated conformational changes. The protein's structure and function are further complicated by its involvement in various cellular processes, including ciliary function and nephron segmentation, as observed in zebrafish models (Barrodia2018EFhand).

## Function
The EFHC2 gene encodes a protein that is associated with ciliary function, particularly in motile cilia. It is thought to be a microtubule inner protein (MIP) that plays a role in the motility of cilia. In model organisms such as Chlamydomonas and Tetrahymena, the loss of EFHC2 orthologues results in defective ciliary axonemes and impaired ciliary beating, although ciliogenesis itself is not disrupted (Cox2024Ancient). In humans, the EFHC2 protein localizes strongly to ciliary axonemes in Xenopus multiciliated cells, indicating its role in ciliary localization and motility, which is crucial for preventing certain diseases (Cox2024Ancient).

In zebrafish, EFHC2 is crucial for the development of multi-ciliated cells (MCC) in the pronephros, an early kidney structure. It regulates nephron segmentation and is involved in the assembly and stability of the ciliary axoneme. The gene acts independently of retinoic acid signaling in distal nephric region segmentation but has a synergistic effect with retinoic acid in MCC formation (Barrodia2018EFhand). While the specific function of EFHC2 in healthy human cells is not fully understood, it is implicated in several brain-related genetic diseases, suggesting a role in neuronal function (Barrodia2018EFhand).

## Clinical Significance
The EFHC2 gene has been implicated in various neurological and psychiatric conditions. Variants in EFHC2 have been associated with anxiety-related traits, such as harm avoidance and behavioral inhibition, as well as panic disorder. A specific intronic SNP, rs1562875, was found to account for over 3% of the variance in harm avoidance traits, suggesting a potential link between EFHC2 variants and anxiety-related conditions (Blaya2009Preliminary).

In the context of social cognitive abilities, the EFHC2 gene has been studied for its role in facial fear recognition and theory of mind abilities. The SNP rs7055196 within EFHC2 has been associated with poorer facial fear detection accuracy and theory of mind abilities in males possessing the G allele, compared to those with the A allele (Startin2015Variation).

Despite these associations, studies have not found a significant link between EFHC2 polymorphisms and idiopathic generalized epilepsy, including juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, suggesting that EFHC2 may not play a direct role in these conditions (Berrin2016No). The gene's involvement in social cognition and anxiety-related traits highlights its potential clinical significance in understanding sex differences in these areas.
