# HNRNPA3

## Overview
HNRNPA3 is a gene that encodes the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A3, a member of the hnRNP A/B family of proteins. These proteins are primarily involved in RNA metabolism, including processes such as splicing, nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling, and translational regulation. The HNRNPA3 protein is characterized by its two N-terminal RNA recognition motifs and a C-terminal glycine-rich domain, which contribute to its role in mRNA maturation and processing (Thibault2021hnRNP). It is functionally similar to hnRNP A1, sharing high sequence similarity and overlapping roles in cellular processes (Papadopoulou2012Expression). HNRNPA3 is implicated in various cellular functions, including cell cycle progression and differentiation, and is associated with several diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders and cancer (Ren2020Abnormal; Thibault2021hnRNP). The protein's interactions with other hnRNPs and its involvement in RNA editing and stability underscore its significance in gene expression regulation and disease pathogenesis (Mishra2018Human; Papadopoulou2012Expression).

## Structure
The HNRNPA3 protein is part of the hnRNP A/B family and is characterized by a structural composition that includes two N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a C-terminal glycine-rich domain, known as a low-complexity domain (LCD) (Thibault2021hnRNP). This glycine-rich LCD contains an RGG motif region, an M9 nuclear localization sequence, and an intrinsically-disordered core prion-like domain (PrLD) (Thibault2021hnRNP). The protein is involved in mRNA maturation processes and shares functional redundancy with hnRNP A1 due to their high sequence similarity (Papadopoulou2012Expression).

HNRNPA3 encodes at least four isoforms, with the relative abundance of these isoforms varying among species and tissues (Thibault2021hnRNP). The isoforms include proteins previously identified as mBx, hnRNP B2, and FBRNP (Thibault2021hnRNP). The protein undergoes several post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at serines 355, 356, or 358 under stress conditions, SUMOylation in the IKED motif of RRM1, N-terminal acetylation at methionine 1, and di-methylation of most arginines in its glycine-rich LCD (Thibault2021hnRNP). These modifications are similar to those in hnRNP A1, its closest homolog (Thibault2021hnRNP).

## Function
HNRNPA3 is a member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) family, which are involved in various aspects of RNA metabolism. In healthy human cells, HNRNPA3 plays a significant role in cell cycle progression, cellular proliferation, and senescence. Overexpression of HNRNPA3 promotes cell cycle progression and proliferation, while its downregulation is associated with cellular differentiation and senescence (Thibault2021hnRNP). 

HNRNPA3 is involved in multiple stages of RNA metabolism, including splicing, nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling, and translational regulation. It is a component of the spliceosome E complex and is associated with alternative splicing. The protein interacts with brain-specific small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) MBII-52, which regulates alternative splicing, and plays a role in intronic polyadenylation (IpA), affecting mRNA processing and protein production (Thibault2021hnRNP). 

HNRNPA3 also collaborates with the Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specificity Factor (CPSF) to promote the usage of an IpA site within the first intron of GRHL3, a transcriptional activator of epidermal differentiation. This collaboration suppresses GRHL3 expression and its downstream terminal differentiation genes, highlighting its role in pre-mRNA processing in keratinocyte differentiation (Chen2021Epidermal). 

The protein is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it influences gene expression and cellular stress responses (Thibault2021hnRNP).

## Clinical Significance
The HNRNPA3 gene is implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, particularly those associated with C9orf72 repeat expansions, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Reduced levels of nuclear hnRNPA3 are linked to increased levels of G4C2 repeat RNA and dipeptide repeat protein (DPR) production, which are pathological features in these conditions. This reduction in hnRNPA3 leads to elevated DPR deposition in neurons, particularly in the hippocampus, contributing to neurodegeneration (Mori2016Reduced). 

In ALS patients with C9orf72 repeat expansions, hnRNPA3 is mislocalized in spinal motor neurons, suggesting its involvement in disease pathogenesis. Knockdown of hnRNPA3 in cell models results in increased RNA foci and DPR accumulation, indicating its role in disease pathology (Fifita2017Genetic). 

HNRNPA3 is also associated with cancer, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In HCC, HNRNPA3 expression increases progressively from non-tumorous tissue to cancerous tissue, correlating with poor survival rates. It serves as a potential biomarker for differentiating stages of liver cancer (Ren2020Abnormal). In NSCLC, hnRNPA3 modulates nuclear EGFR localization, influencing tumor growth and cancer progression (Wang2020Profiling).

## Interactions
HNRNPA3 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in RNA processing and cellular functions. It forms stable protein-protein interactions with other hnRNP proteins, such as hnRNP A1, A2, L, and M, within hnRNP/mRNP complexes. These interactions are largely RNA-independent, except for the association with hnRNP A1, which is RNA-sensitive (Papadopoulou2012Expression). HNRNPA3 also interacts with the nuclear RNA editing protein APOBEC3B in an RNA-independent manner, suggesting a role in RNA editing processes (Mishra2018Human; Thibault2021hnRNP).

In the context of cancer, HNRNPA3 interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), modulating its nuclear localization and potentially influencing tumor progression (Wang2020Profiling). It also associates with the Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specificity Factor (CPSF) complex, affecting intronic polyadenylation and splicing events in keratinocytes (Chen2021Epidermal). Additionally, HNRNPA3 binds to AU-rich elements in mRNA 3' UTRs, contributing to mRNA stability and translation (Papadopoulou2012Expression). These interactions highlight HNRNPA3's involvement in diverse cellular processes, including RNA metabolism, gene expression regulation, and disease pathogenesis.
