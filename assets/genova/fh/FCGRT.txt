# FCGRT

## Overview
The FCGRT gene encodes the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the regulation and homeostasis of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and albumin within the body. Structurally akin to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, FcRn is composed of a heavy chain and a β2-microglobulin light chain, facilitating its function as a receptor and transporter. This receptor is crucial for the recycling and transcytosis of IgG, protecting it from lysosomal degradation and thereby extending its serum half-life. FcRn's ability to bind IgG and albumin in a pH-dependent manner allows it to mediate the transfer of maternal IgG to the fetus, providing passive immunity, and to maintain IgG and albumin levels in various tissues, including the liver and placenta. The receptor's interactions with IgG and albumin are essential for its role in immune surveillance and homeostasis, with significant implications for therapeutic strategies targeting FcRn (Oganesyan2014Structural; Pyzik2023The; Pyzik2019The).

## Structure
The FCGRT gene encodes the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), a protein structurally similar to MHC class I molecules. FcRn is composed of a heavy chain and a β2-microglobulin light chain. The heavy chain includes three extracellular domains (α1, α2, and α3), a single-pass transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail (Rath2013Fcfusion; Pyzik2019The). The α1 and α2 domains form a platform of eight antiparallel β-strands with two α-helices on top, which is a characteristic feature of MHC class I-like structures (Pyzik2019The).

FcRn binds to IgG and albumin in a pH-dependent manner, with high affinity at mildly acidic pH (5.0-6.5) and no detectable binding at neutral pH, except for some mouse IgG2b and human IgG3 allotypes (Pyzik2019The). The interaction with IgG occurs at the CH2 and CH3 domain interface, involving specific residues such as Ile253, His310, and His435 on IgG, and Glu117, Glu118, Glu132, Trp133, Glu135, and Asp137 on FcRn (Rath2013Fcfusion). The pH dependence is due to the protonation of histidine residues at acidic pH, facilitating salt bridge formation with acidic residues on FcRn (Rath2013Fcfusion).

FcRn is glycosylated, which is a common post-translational modification that may influence its function and stability (Rath2013Fcfusion). The receptor's ability to bind both IgG and albumin simultaneously is due to non-overlapping binding sites, allowing it to play a crucial role in ligand transport and recycling (Pyzik2019The).

## Function
The FCGRT gene encodes the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), which plays a crucial role in the regulation of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and albumin levels in healthy human cells. FcRn is involved in the recycling and transcytosis of IgG, protecting it from lysosomal degradation and thereby extending its serum half-life. This process is pH-dependent, with FcRn binding IgG at acidic pH in endosomes and releasing it at neutral pH, allowing IgG to be recycled back into the circulation (Pyzik2023The; Low2020Functional).

FcRn is expressed in various cell types, including epithelial and endothelial cells, and is active in tissues such as the liver, kidney, and placenta. In the liver, FcRn is involved in the recycling of IgG and albumin, contributing to their homeostasis (Pyzik2019The). In the placenta, FcRn mediates the transfer of maternal IgG to the fetus, providing passive immunity to the newborn (Kuo2010Neonatal).

The receptor also plays a role in antigen presentation, enhancing immune responses by facilitating the presentation of IgG-complexed antigens to T-cells, which is important for immune surveillance and homeostasis (Rath2015Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the FCGRT gene, which encodes the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), have significant clinical implications. FcRn is crucial for the regulation of IgG and albumin levels, and its dysfunction can lead to various diseases. A rare human syndrome, familial hypercatabolic hypoproteinemia, is associated with mutations in the β2m gene, affecting FcRn expression and resulting in reduced IgG and albumin levels (Pyzik2019The). Although no human cases of FcRn heavy chain deficiency have been reported, this condition is characterized by a loss-of-function allele of β2 microglobulin, essential for FcRn function (Roopenian2010Clinical).

In cancer, alterations in FcRn expression are linked to disease progression and prognosis. Downregulation of FCGRT in non-small-cell lung cancer correlates with poor prognosis and increased tumor growth, possibly due to altered albumin metabolism (Cadena2020The). FcRn's role in cancer is complex, as both overexpression and underexpression can promote tumor development (Cadena2020The). In breast cancer, FcRn expression levels in epithelial cells and lymph node metastases may serve as prognostic biomarkers, with alterations linked to disease stage and aggressiveness (Cadena2020The).

## Interactions
The FCGRT gene encodes the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), which plays a crucial role in the transport and protection of IgG antibodies. FcRn interacts with the Fc region of IgG, facilitating its recycling and transcytosis across cellular barriers. This interaction is pH-dependent, with strong binding occurring at acidic pH levels found in endosomal compartments (Oganesyan2014Structural; Brinkhaus2022The).

FcRn forms a functional receptor complex with beta-2-microglobulin (β2M), which is essential for its stability and function (Brinkhaus2022The). The interaction between FcRn and IgG is influenced by the presence of the Fab regions of IgG, which can hinder the binding to membrane-associated FcRn, affecting the cellular handling and half-life of IgG (Brinkhaus2022The).

FcRn also interacts with human serum albumin (HSA), forming both binary and ternary complexes. The binding involves significant electrostatic interactions and a hydrophobic core, particularly with HSA domain III, which plays a major role in the interaction (Oganesyan2014Structural). These interactions are crucial for understanding the recycling mechanisms mediated by FcRn and have implications for therapeutic strategies targeting FcRn (Oganesyan2014Structural).
