# GPD1L

## Overview
The GPD1L gene encodes the glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1-like protein, which is a crucial component in cellular metabolism and cardiac function. This protein is categorized as an enzyme due to its role in the glycerol phosphate shuttle, facilitating the conversion of sn-glycerol 3-phosphate to glycerone phosphate, thereby contributing to cellular energy production and redox balance (He2017A; London2007Mutation). GPD1L is highly expressed in cardiac tissue, where it influences the stability of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) and interacts with the cardiac sodium channel NaV1.5, affecting its surface expression and function (Kelly2011A; London2007Mutation). Mutations in GPD1L have been linked to cardiac conditions such as Brugada Syndrome and sudden infant death syndrome, underscoring its clinical significance in cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmogenesis (London2007Mutation; Van2007Molecular).

## Structure
The GPD1L protein, encoded by the GPD1L gene, is involved in cellular metabolism and shares 84% homology with glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1 (GPD1) (London2007Mutation). The protein is 351 amino acids long and contains a glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD) motif, which includes a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate)-binding domain (Yuan2021Novel). This domain is crucial for its enzymatic activity, facilitating the conversion of sn-glycerol 3-phosphate to glycerone phosphate (He2017A).

The secondary structure of GPD1L includes alpha helices, as indicated by the increased strain within the alpha helix caused by the A280V mutation, which suggests steric hindrance and potential protein instability (Greiner2024The). The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is affected by mutations such as A280V, leading to altered intracellular localization and reduced surface expression of associated sodium channels (London2007Mutation).

GPD1L is subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interaction with other proteins, such as the sodium channel SCN5A (Semino2023GPD1LA306del). The protein's expression and function can be modulated by microRNA interactions, notably with miR-210, which regulates its levels through the 3' untranslated region (Kelly2011A).

## Function
The GPD1L gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in cellular energy metabolism and cardiac function. In healthy human cells, GPD1L is involved in the glycerol phosphate shuttle, a critical process for transferring electrons from cytosolic NADH to the mitochondrial transport chain, thereby facilitating energy production and maintaining cellular redox balance (London2007Mutation; Kelly2011A). This protein is highly expressed in heart tissue, where it is particularly abundant in the membrane fraction, indicating its importance in cardiac function (London2007Mutation).

GPD1L also influences the stability of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) by promoting its degradation through proline hydroxylation, a post-translational modification that targets proteins for degradation. This regulatory function is independent of its dehydrogenase activity, suggesting a role in modulating cellular responses to hypoxia (Kelly2011A). In the liver, GPD1L is involved in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis, participating in glycerolipid biosynthesis, which is essential for energy storage and cellular membrane composition (Leung2023Prognostic). These diverse roles underscore the protein's importance in maintaining energy balance and metabolic processes across different tissues.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GPD1L gene are associated with several cardiac conditions, most notably Brugada Syndrome (BrS). BrS is characterized by arrhythmias that can lead to sudden cardiac death. The GPD1L-A280V mutation has been identified as a significant variant linked to BrS, affecting the trafficking of the cardiac sodium channel SCN5A, which results in reduced sodium current and contributes to the arrhythmic phenotype (Greiner2024The; London2007Mutation). 

GPD1L mutations have also been implicated in sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Specific mutations such as E83K, I124V, and R273C have been identified in SIDS cases, where they disrupt sodium channel function, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype similar to that seen in BrS (Van2007Molecular). These mutations are absent in large control populations, suggesting their pathogenic role (Van2007Molecular).

Alterations in GPD1L can also affect cardiac conduction and have been linked to other arrhythmogenic disorders, including atrial fibrillation and early repolarization syndrome (Semino2023GPD1LA306del). The gene's role in modulating sodium channel function through interactions with protein kinase A and other proteins highlights its clinical significance in cardiac electrophysiology (Semino2023GPD1LA306del).

## Interactions
Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1-like protein (GPD1L) is known to interact with the cardiac sodium channel NaV1.5, encoded by the SCN5A gene. This interaction is significant in the context of cardiac function and arrhythmias such as Brugada Syndrome (BrS). GPD1L has been shown to modulate the function of NaV1.5, although it does not directly bind to the channel. Instead, it affects the channel's surface expression and function through indirect mechanisms (London2007Mutation; Shy2013Cardiac).

Mutations in GPD1L, such as A280V, have been linked to a decrease in sodium current (I_Na) by affecting the intracellular localization of GPD1L and its association with the plasma membrane. This results in reduced surface expression of NaV1.5, contributing to conditions like BrS (London2007Mutation; Willis2015Protein). The interaction between GPD1L and NaV1.5 is further influenced by protein kinase C (PKC), which phosphorylates NaV1.5 at serine 1503, reducing I_Na. This phosphorylation is modulated by GPD1L's enzymatic activity, which affects PKC's function (Adsit2013Channelopathies; Herren2013Posttranslational).
