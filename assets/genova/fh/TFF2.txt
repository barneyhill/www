# TFF2

## Overview
Trefoil Factor 2 (TFF2) is a gene that encodes a secretory peptide belonging to the trefoil factor family, which is characterized by its unique structural motifs known as trefoil domains. These domains are crucial for the protein's stability and function, particularly in the harsh environment of the gastrointestinal tract (Hoffmann2020Trefoil; Braga2020Structure). The TFF2 protein plays a significant role in maintaining the integrity of the gastric mucosal barrier and facilitating mucosal repair processes. It is predominantly expressed in the stomach and duodenum, where it interacts with mucins such as MUC6 to stabilize the gastric mucus barrier (Heuer2019Different). Beyond its structural role, TFF2 is involved in modulating immune responses and promoting epithelial restitution, making it essential for gastrointestinal health and a potential therapeutic target in conditions such as gastric cancer and inflammatory diseases (Hoffmann2021Trefoil; Braga2019Trefoil).

## Structure
TFF2, a member of the trefoil factor family, is a secretory polypeptide characterized by its unique molecular structure. The primary structure of TFF2 consists of 106 amino acids, including two cysteine-rich trefoil domains, which are crucial for its stability and function (Hoffmann2020Trefoil; Braga2020Structure). These domains are stabilized by three disulfide bonds, forming a compact three-looped structure that is resistant to proteolytic degradation, allowing TFF2 to function effectively in the gastrointestinal environment (Hoffmann2021Trefoila; Braga2020Structure).

The secondary and tertiary structures of TFF2 involve the folding of these domains into a stable conformation, with a pronounced groove between the ends of the second and third loops, which may serve as a binding site for oligosaccharides or aromatic amino acid side chains (Hoffmann2021Trefoila). TFF2's quaternary structure is typically monomeric, but it can form high-molecular-mass complexes with mucins, such as MUC6, through lectin interactions (Hoffmann2020Trefoil; Znalesniak2023The).

Post-translational modifications of TFF2 include N-glycosylation, with human TFF2 featuring an unusual fucosylated LacdiNAc oligosaccharide, which may influence its interaction with mucins and its stability (Hoffmann2021Trefoil; Znalesniak2023The). This glycosylation pattern is absent in murine and porcine homologs (Hoffmann2021Trefoila).

## Function
Trefoil factor 2 (TFF2) is a peptide primarily involved in maintaining the integrity of the gastric mucosal barrier and facilitating mucosal repair processes. It is predominantly expressed in the stomach and duodenum, where it is secreted by gastric and duodenal glands, often in association with the mucin MUC6 (Heuer2019Different). TFF2 functions as a lectin, binding specifically to MUC6, which helps stabilize the inner insoluble gastric mucus barrier, crucial for protecting the gastric lining (Heuer2019Different).

TFF2 plays a significant role in epithelial restitution by promoting cell migration and inhibiting apoptosis, essential for mucosal healing (Engevik2019Trefoil). It interacts with chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CXCR7, triggering ERK1/2 signaling pathways that are important for immune cell recruitment and epithelial repair (Braga2019Trefoil). TFF2 also activates protease-activated receptor 4 (PAR4), which is vital for mucosal healing, and binds non-covalently to integrin β1, facilitating cell migration (Braga2019Trefoil).

In addition to its structural role, TFF2 modulates immune responses by regulating cytokine expression and immunocyte migration, contributing to its protective effects against inflammatory conditions and infections like Helicobacter pylori (Braga2020Structure). These functions underscore TFF2's critical role in maintaining gastrointestinal health and integrity.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TFF2 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of gastric and other epithelial cancers. In gastric cancer, TFF2 is often downregulated, which is associated with poorer overall survival and tumor-free survival. This downregulation is linked to increased DNA methylation, suggesting that epigenetic modifications may silence TFF2 expression, contributing to a worse prognosis (Qian2022Validation). TFF2 is also involved in the development of spasmolytic polypeptide/TFF2-expressing metaplasia (SPEM), a pre-neoplastic condition in gastric cancer (Jahan2020Odyssey).

In addition to its role in cancer, TFF2 is crucial for maintaining gastric mucosal integrity. TFF2-deficient mice exhibit increased gastric acid secretion and are more susceptible to NSAID-induced gastric injury, indicating its protective role against gastric ulcers (Farrell2002TFF2SPdeficient). TFF2 also plays a role in immune regulation, as its absence leads to increased susceptibility to infections and inflammatory diseases, such as colitis, by affecting cytokine production and immune cell function (Hoffmann2021Trefoil).

Overall, TFF2's expression and interaction with other molecular pathways are critical in both cancer progression and the maintenance of gastrointestinal health, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target.

## Interactions
Trefoil Factor 2 (TFF2) is known for its interactions with various proteins, primarily within the gastric mucus barrier. TFF2 is co-secreted with the mucin MUC6 from gastric and duodenal glands, where it acts as a lectin binding to MUC6. This interaction is modulated by calcium ions and can be inhibited by specific lectins and antibodies (Heuer2019Different). TFF2 also binds to MUC5AC, although its binding to MUC6 is more predominant and significant for stabilizing the gastric mucus barrier (Heuer2019Different).

In addition to mucins, TFF2 has been shown to interact weakly with other proteins such as β-integrin, DMBT1, PAR2, CXCR4, and CXCR7, which may play roles in cell signaling and inflammatory responses (Heuer2019Different). TFF2 also interacts with the transcription factor Sp3, which has implications in gastric cancer. This interaction inhibits gastric cancer cell growth and invasion, suggesting a potential therapeutic role for TFF2 in cancer treatment (Cai2016Trefoil).

TFF2's binding to mucins involves specific carbohydrate epitopes, such as GlcNAcα1→4Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ, and is crucial for maintaining the gastric mucosal pH gradient (Heuer2019Different).
