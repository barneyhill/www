# BLOC1S3

## Overview
BLOC1S3 is a gene that encodes the protein biogenesis of lysosomal organelles complex 1 subunit 3, which is a critical component of the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-1 (BLOC-1). This protein is involved in intracellular trafficking, particularly in the sorting and transport of proteins to lysosome-related organelles such as melanosomes and platelet dense granules. BLOC1S3 plays a significant role in processes like pigmentation and platelet function, and its activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis. The protein is categorized as part of a cytoplasmic complex that interacts with other proteins to facilitate the transport of specific cargoes, including polycystin-2 to primary cilia, which is essential for ciliary function and structure (Starcevic2004Identification; Monis2017BLOC-1). Mutations in the BLOC1S3 gene are linked to disorders such as Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome and have been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, including schizophrenia, due to their impact on synaptic function and membrane protein sorting (Morris2008Dysbindin; Morgan2006A).

## Function
BLOC1S3 is a component of the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-1 (BLOC-1), which plays a crucial role in intracellular trafficking, particularly in the sorting and transport of proteins to lysosome-related organelles such as melanosomes and platelet dense granules. In healthy human cells, BLOC1S3 is involved in the biogenesis of these organelles, which are essential for processes like pigmentation and platelet function (Starcevic2004Identification; Morgan2006A).

BLOC1S3 is active in the cytoplasm and is part of a complex that interacts with other proteins to facilitate the transport of specific cargoes. It is involved in the trafficking of proteins such as polycystin-2 to primary cilia, which is crucial for ciliary function and structure (Monis2017BLOC-1). The BLOC-1 complex, including BLOC1S3, also interacts with the exocyst complex to ensure proper delivery of membrane proteins to their destinations, maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis (Monis2017BLOC-1).

Mutations in BLOC1S3 can lead to disorders such as Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, characterized by defects in pigmentation and platelet function, highlighting its importance in these biological processes (Morgan2006A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the BLOC1S3 gene are associated with Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (HPS) type 8, a genetic disorder characterized by hypopigmentation, bleeding disorders, and lysosomal storage defects. In particular, a nonsense mutation in the BLOS3-encoding gene, resulting in a premature termination codon (Q80X), has been identified in a mouse model of HPS known as reduced pigmentation (rp) mice. This mutation affects the protein levels of BLOC-1 subunits, leading to reduced pigmentation, although some residual BLOC-1 function remains (Starcevic2004Identification).

Alterations in BLOC1S3 expression and its interactions have also been implicated in schizophrenia. Genetic studies have shown a significant association between BLOC1S3 and schizophrenia, with specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to increased risk. The BLOC1S3 gene interacts with other BLOC-1 subunits, such as dysbindin, and mutations may destabilize the complex, impacting synaptic function and contributing to schizophrenia susceptibility (Morris2008Dysbindin). The potential role of BLOC1S3 in neurodevelopmental disorders is also suggested by its involvement in synaptic vesicle trafficking and membrane protein sorting, processes crucial for neuronal function (Hartwig2017Neurodevelopmental).

## Interactions
BLOC1S3, also known as blos3, is a subunit of the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-1 (BLOC-1). It interacts with other BLOC-1 subunits, including pallidin, cappuccino, and muted, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and co-sedimentation experiments. These interactions suggest that blos3 is an integral part of the BLOC-1 complex, contributing to its stability and function (Li2007The). The BLOC-1 complex is involved in endosomal transport and forms stable macromolecular assemblies on membranes by interacting with other complexes such as BLOC-2 and AP-3. However, no interactions have been observed between BLOC-3 and BLOC-1 or BLOC-2 (Li2007The).

Despite the identification of numerous candidate binding partners for BLOC-1 subunits through data-mining approaches, no specific candidate binding partner has been described for BLOC1S3 (Rodriguez‐Fernandez2008A). The study of BLOC-1 interactions in Drosophila melanogaster also supports the existence of a fly counterpart to mammalian BLOC-1, although specific interactions involving BLOS3 were not detailed (Cheli2009Genetic). Further research is needed to elucidate the detailed interactions and functions of BLOC1S3 within the BLOC-1 complex.
