# PYCR1

## Overview
Pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1 (PYCR1) is a gene that encodes an enzyme of the same name, which plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of proline, an amino acid crucial for protein synthesis and cellular redox balance. The PYCR1 protein is categorized as an oxidoreductase and is primarily localized in the mitochondria, where it catalyzes the NAD(P)H-dependent conversion of pyrroline-5-carboxylate to proline, with a preference for NADH as a cofactor (Hu2021Isozymes). Structurally, the enzyme features a modified NAD(P)-binding Rossmann fold and forms a decameric assembly essential for its enzymatic activity (Meng2006Crystal). Mutations in the PYCR1 gene are associated with autosomal recessive disorders such as cutis laxa types IIB and III, which manifest as connective tissue abnormalities and developmental issues (Hu2021Isozymes). Additionally, PYCR1 is implicated in cancer biology, where its overexpression is linked to tumor progression, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Hu2021Isozymes).

## Structure
The PYCR1 protein is composed of 319 amino acid residues and is involved in the proline biosynthesis pathway. Its structure includes a modified NAD(P)-binding Rossmann fold, which is a common feature in oxidoreductases, and is characterized by an extended eight-stranded β-sheet and a hemi-β-barrel structure (Meng2006Crystal). The protein forms a decameric structure, consisting of five homodimers, which is crucial for its enzymatic function (Meng2006Crystal). The monomeric unit of PYCR1 is organized into two distinct domains: the N-terminal domain, which contains the Rossmann fold, and the C-terminal domain, which is rich in α-helices and facilitates dimerization (Meng2006Crystal).

The active site of PYCR1 is located at the dimer interface, where it binds cofactors and substrate analogs. Specific residues, such as Thr238, play a role in substrate binding through hydrogen bonding (Christensen2020In). The enzyme's quaternary structure is essential for its high turnover rate, with ten catalytic sites available in the decameric assembly (Meng2006Crystal). PYCR1 is also subject to post-translational modifications, including potential phosphorylation, which may regulate its activity. Splice variants of PYCR1 can result in different isoforms, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
PYCR1 (pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in proline biosynthesis, catalyzing the conversion of pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) to proline. This process is essential for maintaining cellular redox balance and supporting protein synthesis. PYCR1 is primarily localized in the mitochondria, where it contributes to the conversion of glutamate to proline, a reaction that is NAD(P)H-dependent, with a preference for NADH as a cofactor (Hu2021Isozymes).

In healthy human cells, PYCR1 is vital for mitochondrial function and integrity. It is involved in the generation of NADP+, which is crucial for the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). The PPP is important for maintaining high levels of reduced glutathione and peroxiredoxins, which protect cells against reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Hu2021Isozymes). PYCR1 also influences nucleotide synthesis by increasing phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) levels, which are important for DNA and RNA synthesis (Hu2021Isozymes).

Mutations in PYCR1 are associated with autosomal recessive cutis laxa types IIB and III, which are characterized by connective tissue disorders and developmental abnormalities, highlighting its importance in normal cellular and organismal function (Hu2021Isozymes).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PYCR1 gene are linked to several autosomal recessive disorders, most notably autosomal recessive cutis laxa type 2B (ARCL2B) and De Barsy syndrome (ARCL3). ARCL2B is characterized by loose, wrinkled skin, growth retardation, distinctive facial features, and developmental delays. Patients often exhibit skeletal abnormalities, joint hyperlaxity, and hypotonia (Gardeitchik2013Clinical; Shangguan2024Confirming). De Barsy syndrome presents with progeroid features, ophthalmological abnormalities, and intrauterine growth retardation (Lin2011Compound).

PYCR1 mutations can also lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, as seen in fibroblasts from affected individuals, which show defective mitochondrial morphology and increased apoptosis under oxidative stress (Hu2021Isozymes). In zebrafish models, PYCR1 deficiency results in premature aging symptoms, reduced antioxidative capacity, and behavioral abnormalities, providing insights into the gene's role in aging and potential anti-aging therapies (Liang2019Zebrafish).

In cancer, PYCR1 overexpression is associated with increased proline content, reduced reactive oxygen species levels, and enhanced cell survival, correlating with tumor progression and poor prognosis. Inhibition of PYCR1 has been shown to block tumor formation, highlighting its potential as a target for anticancer therapies (Hu2021Isozymes).

## Interactions
PYCR1 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular stress responses and metabolic processes. It colocalizes and interacts with RRM2B and PYCR2 in mitochondria. While RRM2B is primarily cytosolic, a fraction is present in mitochondria where it interacts with PYCR1 and PYCR2, especially under stress conditions like treatment with Adriamycin, which increases RRM2B levels in mitochondria (Kuo2016PYCR1). These interactions are significant for protecting cells from oxidative stress, as RRM2B, PYCR1, and PYCR2 form complexes that help maintain mitochondrial function and reduce reactive oxygen species (Kuo2016PYCR1).

PYCR1 also interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in oesophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC). This interaction is crucial for the oncogenic functions of PYCR1, as knockdown of PYCR1 reduces cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by limiting its interaction with EGFR (Meng2022Knockdown).

In hypoxic conditions, PYCR1 is phosphorylated by IGF1R, enhancing its interaction with the transcription factor ELK4. This interaction is important for ELK4-mediated transcriptional repression, which supports tumor growth under hypoxia (Zheng2023IGF1Rphosphorylated). PYCR1's phosphorylation at Tyr-135 by IGF1R facilitates its binding to ELK4, highlighting its role in stress-responsive signaling (Zheng2023IGF1Rphosphorylated).
