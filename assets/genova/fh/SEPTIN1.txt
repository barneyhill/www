# SEPTIN1

## Overview
SEPTIN1 is a gene that encodes the protein septin 1, a member of the septin family of GTP-binding proteins. Septin 1 is involved in various cellular processes, including cytokinesis, cellular organization, and maintaining the structural integrity of the Golgi apparatus. It is characterized by a conserved GTPase domain, which is crucial for its function in forming filamentous structures that serve as scaffolds within the cell (Song2019A; Cao2009The). These structures facilitate interactions with other proteins, contributing to the dynamic rearrangement of cellular components. Septin 1 plays a significant role in vesicle trafficking and cell shape maintenance, and its dysfunction is associated with diseases such as cancer and neurological disorders (Eze; Song2019A). The protein's ability to interact with various partners, including microtubule-associated proteins and kinases, underscores its importance in cellular integrity and function (Neubauer2017The; Desterke2019Proteinprotein).

## Structure
SEPTIN1 is a member of the septin family of GTP-binding proteins, characterized by a conserved GTPase domain. The primary structure of SEPTIN1 includes this GTPase domain, which is essential for its function in cellular processes such as cytokinesis and cellular organization (Cao2009The). The secondary structure of SEPTIN1 is composed of alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its stability and function. The tertiary structure of SEPTIN1 forms a globular shape, which is typical for proteins involved in dynamic cellular processes (Cao2009The).

In terms of quaternary structure, SEPTIN1 assembles into filamentous structures, which are crucial for its role as a scaffold in maintaining the integrity of cellular components like the Golgi apparatus (Song2019A). These filamentous assemblies allow SEPTIN1 to interact with other proteins and form higher-order structures necessary for its function (Song2019A).

Post-translational modifications of SEPTIN1 may include phosphorylation, which can regulate its activity and interactions with other proteins (Cao2009The). SEPTIN1's ability to form complexes and its dynamic rearrangements are essential for its role in cellular organization and function (Song2019A).

## Function
SEPTIN1 (septin 1) is a crucial component of the septin family of GTP-binding proteins, playing a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the Golgi apparatus in healthy human cells. SEPTIN1 localizes predominantly to the cis-Golgi membranes, where it interacts with the Golgi matrix protein GM130, facilitating its anchoring at the Golgi and supporting the nucleation of Golgi-derived microtubules (Song2019A). This interaction is essential for maintaining Golgi architecture, as depletion of SEPTIN1 leads to significant Golgi fragmentation and impaired membrane trafficking (Song2019A).

SEPTIN1 functions independently of other septin family members, suggesting it acts as a homodimer or homooligomeric multimer at the Golgi, contributing to the formation and maintenance of elongated cisternae (Song2019A). It is also involved in the release of secretory cargo from the Golgi, as its depletion results in delayed export of proteins and reduced secretion of molecules like adiponectin (Song2019A). SEPTIN1's role in Golgi integrity and function highlights its importance in cellular processes such as vesicle trafficking and maintaining cell shape.

## Clinical Significance
SEPT1 is a protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, and its dysfunction is associated with several diseases. Alterations in SEPT1 expression or mutations can lead to significant cellular and physiological abnormalities. In particular, SEPT1 is involved in the regulation of the cytoskeleton and is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the Golgi apparatus. Disruptions in these functions can lead to a variety of diseases, including cancer, where altered cell division and growth are hallmarks. Additionally, SEPT1 has been implicated in neurological disorders due to its role in neuronal signaling and synaptic function. For instance, it is involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity, and its dysfunction can contribute to neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia (Eze; Song2019A). 

In the context of cancer, SEPT1 is known to be involved in the regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis, and its dysregulation can lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Furthermore, mutations in SEPT1 have been associated with various cancers, including breast cancer, where they can contribute to tumor progression and metastasis (Song2019A). These findings highlight the critical role of SEPT1 in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer and other diseases. 

Overall, the dysfunction of SEPT1, whether through genetic mutations or altered expression, can lead to a range of pathologies, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular and physiological homeostasis.

## Interactions
SEPTIN1, a member of the septin family, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its cellular functions. SEPTIN1 interacts with CAPS1 (Ca2+-dependent activator protein for secretion 1) in the mouse brain. This interaction involves the GTP-binding domain of SEPTIN1 and the C-terminal domain of CAPS1, suggesting a role in vesicle fusion events and dense-core vesicle synthesis and release (Hosono2016Interaction).

SEPTIN1 is also a target of aurora-B kinase, which is essential for chromosome segregation and cytokinesis, indicating its involvement in cell division processes (Neubauer2017The). Additionally, SEPTIN1 binds to the microtubule-associated protein tau, which is significant in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (Neubauer2017The).

In the context of cell division, SEPTIN1 is connected to important partners like RAD21, involved in double-strand DNA repair, and AURKB, which codes for aurora kinase B (Desterke2019Proteinprotein). These interactions highlight SEPTIN1's role in maintaining cellular integrity and its potential involvement in various cellular processes, including vesicle trafficking and neurodegenerative disease mechanisms.
