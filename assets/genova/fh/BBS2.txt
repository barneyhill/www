# BBS2

## Overview
BBS2 is a gene that encodes the Bardet-Biedl syndrome 2 protein, a critical component of the BBSome complex, which is involved in ciliary function and membrane-protein trafficking. The BBS2 protein is characterized by its structural domains, including a β-propeller domain, a heterodimerization α-helix, an immunoglobulin-like GAE domain, and a mixed α/β platform domain, which facilitate its interactions within the BBSome complex and with other proteins. These interactions are essential for the proper trafficking of proteins to cilia, which are vital for cell signaling and sensory perception. Mutations in the BBS2 gene are linked to Bardet-Biedl Syndrome, a disorder with diverse symptoms such as obesity, retinal degeneration, and renal anomalies, highlighting the gene's clinical significance (Singh2019Structure; Yen2006Bardet–Biedl; Nishimura2001Positional).

## Structure
The BBS2 protein is a component of the BBSome complex, which plays a crucial role in membrane-protein trafficking. The molecular structure of BBS2 includes several distinct domains. It begins with an N-terminal β-propeller domain, which is part of the seven-bladed WD40 repeat family. This domain features a 'velcro' closure, where the N-terminal β1-strand serves as the outermost strand for the last blade. Unique to BBS2, this domain contains two calcium-binding loops located in blade 4 and blade 6, which are essential for its function (Singh2019Structure).

Following the β-propeller domain is a heterodimerization α-helix, an immunoglobulin-like GAE domain, and a mixed α/β platform domain. The GAE domain of BBS2 dimerizes with the GAE domain of BBS7, forming part of the head of the BBSome. This dimerization occludes the peptide-binding site typical of clathrin adaptor GAE domains (Singh2019Structure). The platform domain, which resembles the platform domain in the α-adaptin subunit of the clathrin AP-2 complex, is solvent accessible but not yet implicated in substrate recognition (Singh2019Structure).

The C-terminal region of BBS2 contains a helical coiled-coil, which forms part of the neck of the BBSome by interacting with the coiled-coil of BBS9 (Singh2019Structure). The quaternary structure of BBS2 involves its interaction with other BBSome components, such as BBS1 and BBS7, contributing to the overall assembly and function of the BBSome complex (Singh2019Structure).

## Function
The BBS2 gene encodes a protein that is a component of the BBSome complex, which is crucial for ciliary function in human cells. This complex is involved in the trafficking of proteins to the cilia, which are hair-like structures on the surface of cells that play a key role in cell signaling and sensory perception (Yen2006Bardet–Biedl). BBS2, along with other BBS proteins, is believed to be involved in retrograde intracellular trafficking, particularly in the transport of organelles such as melanosomes, which are essential for maintaining cellular processes (Yen2006Bardet–Biedl).

In zebrafish models, knockdown of BBS2 results in defects in cilia formation and maintenance, indicating its critical role in these processes (Yen2006Bardet–Biedl). The protein is also implicated in the formation of Kupffer's vesicle, a ciliated organ involved in establishing left-right asymmetry during development (Yen2006Bardet–Biedl). These findings suggest that BBS2 is essential for proper ciliary function and intracellular transport, which are vital for normal cellular and organismal development. The evolutionary conservation of BBS2 across species further supports its fundamental role in these cellular processes (Nishimura2001Positional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the BBS2 gene are associated with Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS), a genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by a range of symptoms including obesity, retinal degeneration, polydactyly, renal anomalies, and cognitive impairment (Khan2016Genetics; Nishimura2001Positional). BBS2 is part of the BBSome complex, which is crucial for ciliary function. Mutations in BBS2 can disrupt the assembly of the BBSome, leading to defects in ciliogenesis and contributing to the clinical manifestations of BBS (Bee2015Whole).

Specific mutations in BBS2, such as nonsense mutations and missense mutations, have been identified in patients with BBS. For instance, the p.R622X and p.Y644X mutations have been reported in individuals with BBS, with the latter being a novel mutation found in a highly conserved region (Bee2015Whole). Additionally, BBS2 mutations have been linked to nonsyndromic retinitis pigmentosa, a form of retinal degeneration, particularly in certain populations (Shevach2015Association).

The clinical severity of BBS can vary depending on the specific BBS2 mutations and their interactions with other genetic variants. Some studies suggest that BBS2 mutations may have a modifier role, influencing the severity of the phenotype in conjunction with mutations in other BBS genes (Shevach2015Association; Badano2003Heterozygous).

## Interactions
BBS2 is a component of the BBSome complex, which is crucial for ciliary function and membrane-protein trafficking. It forms a tight dimer with BBS7 through a coiled-coil interaction, facilitated by specific residues, and this dimer is stabilized by chaperones such as BBS6, BBS10, BBS12, and the cytosolic chaperonin CCT (Seo2010BBS6; Ludlam2019Molecular). BBS2 also interacts with BBS9 via its α-helical domain, linking the BBS2/BBS7 dimer to a larger hexameric subcomplex (Ludlam2019Molecular).

Mutations in BBS2, such as R632P, disrupt its interaction with BBS9, affecting the stability and assembly of the BBSome complex, which is implicated in Bardet-Biedl syndrome (Singh2019Structure; Ludlam2019Molecular). BBS2's β-propeller domain, part of the seven-bladed WD40 repeat family, is involved in calcium binding, which is essential for its function (Singh2019Structure).

BBS2 also interacts with other proteins outside the BBSome complex. It has been shown to interact with ALDOB, EEF1A1, and EPAS1, as confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid assays (Oeffner2007Novel). These interactions suggest a role in intracellular trafficking and ciliary function, although the precise mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated.
