# HAO2

## Overview
The HAO2 gene encodes the enzyme hydroxyacid oxidase 2, which is a member of the L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase family. This enzyme is primarily localized in the peroxisomes of liver and kidney cells, where it plays a critical role in the oxidation of L-2-hydroxy acids to ketoacids, a process that generates hydrogen peroxide as a byproduct. As a flavin mononucleotide-dependent enzyme, hydroxyacid oxidase 2 is involved in fatty acid alpha-oxidation, contributing to cellular energy metabolism and redox balance. The regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by HAO2 is essential for protecting cells from oxidative stress and maintaining normal cellular functions. Alterations in HAO2 expression have been implicated in various diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma and chronic kidney disease, where its downregulation is associated with adverse clinical outcomes (Mattu2016The; Barawkar2011Potent; Li2022Role).

## Function
HAO2 (hydroxyacid oxidase 2) is a peroxisomal enzyme primarily expressed in the liver and kidney. It belongs to the family of L-2-hydroxy acid oxidases, which are flavin mononucleotide-dependent enzymes responsible for the oxidation of L-2-hydroxy acids to ketoacids. This enzymatic activity results in the production of hydrogen peroxide, a reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can influence cellular redox balance and energy production (Mattu2016The; Barawkar2011Potent).

HAO2 shows the greatest enzymatic activity with long-chain 2-hydroxy acid substrates, such as 2-hydroxypalmitate, and plays a role in the general pathway of fatty acid alpha-oxidation. This process is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and energy metabolism, particularly in tissues with high metabolic demands like the liver and kidney (Mattu2016The; Barawkar2011Potent).

In healthy human cells, HAO2 contributes to the regulation of ROS levels, which can impact cell proliferation and survival. By modulating ROS, HAO2 helps protect cells from oxidative stress and potential damage, thereby supporting normal cellular functions and metabolic processes (Mattu2016The).

## Clinical Significance
The HAO2 gene is clinically significant in several diseases due to its altered expression levels. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), HAO2 is consistently downregulated across different species and models, including human HCC samples. This downregulation is associated with higher tumor grades, increased metastatic potential, and poorer overall survival rates, suggesting that HAO2 acts as a tumor suppressor gene. The loss of HAO2 expression is an early event in hepatocarcinogenesis and is linked to aggressive and poorly differentiated HCCs (Mattu2016The).

In chronic kidney disease (CKD), reduced HAO2 expression leads to impaired fatty acid metabolism, resulting in increased lipid droplet accumulation and higher free fatty acid levels. This alteration contributes to ATP depletion and exacerbates kidney damage, highlighting the role of HAO2 in maintaining proper lipid metabolism in renal tissues (Li2022Role).

In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), low HAO2 expression is linked to shorter overall and disease-free survival. HAO2 downregulation in ccRCC tissues and cell lines is associated with increased tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Xiao2019HAO2).
