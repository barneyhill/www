# SPPL2C

## Overview
SPPL2C is a gene that encodes the protein signal peptide peptidase-like 2C, which is a member of the GxGD-type intramembrane aspartyl proteases. This protein is characterized by its multi-pass transmembrane structure, containing nine transmembrane domains, and is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) (Papadopoulou2019Signal; Mentrup2020Physiological). SPPL2C is involved in crucial cellular processes, including vesicular transport and calcium homeostasis, by cleaving specific substrates such as SNARE proteins and phospholamban (PLN) (Papadopoulou2019Signal; Niemeyer2019The). The gene is expressed in various human tissues, with a notable role in male reproductive biology, particularly in spermatogenesis (Niemeyer2019The). Additionally, SPPL2C has been implicated in clinical contexts, such as Alzheimer's disease and male fertility, highlighting its significance in both neurological and reproductive health (He2021Exomewide; Niemeyer2019The).

## Structure
SPPL2C is a multi-pass transmembrane protein with nine transmembrane domains, characteristic of the GxGD-type intramembrane aspartyl proteases (Papadopoulou2019Signal). It is selective for type II (N in) transmembrane segments, distinguishing it from presenilins, which process type I (N out) segments (Papadopoulou2019Signal). The protein contains conserved catalytic motifs, including the YD/FD and GxGD signature motifs, which are typical of intramembrane aspartyl proteases (Niemeyer2019The).

SPPL2C is part of a large protein complex, approximately 500 kDa, although the exact composition and function of these complexes are not fully understood (Mentrup2020Physiological). The protein is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), but the specific signal that retains it in these compartments remains unidentified (Mentrup2020Physiological).

The SPPL2C gene is noted for its polymorphic and intron-less structure, which has led to discussions about it potentially being a pseudogene (Papadopoulou2019Signal). Despite this, SPPL2C is expressed in human tissues such as the testis, brain, skin, and heart, although evidence of protein-level expression is limited (Mentrup2017Latest).

## Function
SPPL2C is an intramembrane protease primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and early Golgi compartments. It plays a significant role in vesicular transport by cleaving SNARE proteins, which are essential for vesicle fusion and trafficking processes. This proteolytic activity affects the levels and localization of various proteins involved in vesicular transport, leading to the accumulation of immature cargo proteins in the ER and potentially triggering endoplasmic-reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) (Papadopoulou2019Signal).

SPPL2C is also involved in the regulation of calcium homeostasis in male germ cells by cleaving phospholamban (PLN), an inhibitor of the SERCA2 calcium pump. This activity is crucial for maintaining proper calcium levels in the ER, which is important for spermatogenesis and sperm motility (Niemeyer2019The). The protein's expression is highly restricted to the testis, particularly in developing male germ cells, indicating its specialized role in male reproductive biology (Niemeyer2019The).

SPPL2C's activity also impacts glycosylation processes by affecting the transport and maturation of glycan-modifying enzymes, leading to changes in glycan structures that are important for cellular functions (Papadopoulou2019Signal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SPPL2C gene have been associated with several clinical implications. In the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a missense variant in SPPL2C, rs12373123, has been identified. This variant is in complete linkage disequilibrium with multiple variants in the MAPT region and is associated with a decreased risk of AD in APOE ε4 non-carriers after age 70 (He2021Exomewide). The protective minor allele of this variant is linked to increased expression of GRN in microglia and MAPT expression in astrocytes, suggesting a role in modulating AD risk through mechanisms involving the unfolded protein response and ER stress (He2021Exomewide).

In male fertility, SPPL2C plays a critical role in spermatogenesis. SPPL2C-deficient mice exhibit reduced numbers of elongated spermatids and altered glycan patterns in mature spermatozoa, leading to subfertility. This is evidenced by reduced litter sizes in homozygous SPPL2C-deficient breedings, although fertility is not significantly affected when these males are mated with wild-type females (Papadopoulou2019Signal; Niemeyer2019The). These findings suggest that SPPL2C deficiency impacts sperm maturation and function, potentially contributing to fertility issues.

## Interactions
SPPL2C is involved in several protein interactions, primarily through its role as an intramembrane protease. It cleaves SNARE proteins, which are essential for vesicular transport and membrane fusion. This activity affects the function and localization of these proteins, such as Syntaxin 5 and Syntaxin 8, leading to impaired vesicular transport and altered protein sorting (Papadopoulou2019Signal). SPPL2C also interacts with phospholamban (PLN), a regulator of the SERCA2 Ca2+-ATPase, influencing calcium homeostasis in male germ cells. This interaction is crucial for spermatid differentiation and function (Niemeyer2019The; Young2019Regulating).

SPPL2C's expression impacts the levels of glycan-modifying enzymes and glycosyltransferases, leading to hypoglycosylation and accumulation of immature proteins. This is partly due to its interaction with proteins involved in glycan modification, which are altered in abundance in SPPL2C-expressing cells (Papadopoulou2019Signal). The protease's activity results in the retention of glycosyltransferases in the endoplasmic reticulum, affecting glycoprotein glycosylation and vesicular trafficking (Young2019Regulating). These interactions highlight SPPL2C's role in maintaining subcellular compartmentalization and influencing intracellular vesicle trafficking.
