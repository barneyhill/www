# ITGB6

## Overview
The ITGB6 gene encodes the integrin subunit beta 6, a component of the heterodimeric transmembrane receptor integrin αvβ6. This integrin is primarily expressed in epithelial cells and plays a pivotal role in cell adhesion, migration, and signaling processes. The β6 subunit, unique for its C-terminal extension, pairs with the αv subunit to form the functional αvβ6 integrin, which is involved in the activation of latent transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) complexes, crucial for maintaining tissue homeostasis and modulating immune responses (Koivisto2018Integrin; Brzozowska2022Integrin). The integrin αvβ6 is implicated in various physiological processes, including wound healing and epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, and is associated with pathological conditions such as cancer and fibrosis, where its expression is often dysregulated (Koivisto2018Integrin; Zhong2021ITGB6).

## Structure
The ITGB6 gene encodes the β6 subunit of the integrin αvβ6, a heterodimeric transmembrane protein involved in cell adhesion and signaling. The primary structure of the β6 subunit consists of 788 amino acids (Singh2014Structural). The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, as predicted by tools like PSIPRED (Singh2014Structural). The tertiary structure of ITGB6 has been modeled using homology modeling techniques, with the best model selected based on the lowest DOPE score (Singh2014Structural).

The β6 subunit contains specific domains such as the I-like domain and hybrid domain, which are common in integrin beta subunits (Campbell2011Integrin). The β6 subunit also features a unique C-terminal extension of 11 amino acids, which is not found in other integrins and contributes to its specific functions, particularly in cancer (Koivisto2018Integrin; Brzozowska2022Integrin). 

Post-translational modifications of ITGB6 include glycosylation and phosphorylation, which are typical for integrin proteins (Brzozowska2022Integrin). The quaternary structure involves the association of the β6 subunit with the αv subunit to form the functional αvβ6 integrin heterodimer (Koivisto2018Integrin).

## Function
The ITGB6 gene encodes the integrin subunit beta 6, which pairs with the alpha v subunit to form the integrin αvβ6. This integrin is primarily expressed in epithelial cells and plays a crucial role in various cellular and physiological processes. In healthy human cells, αvβ6 integrin is involved in cell adhesion, migration, and the activation of latent transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) complexes, which are essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis and immune function (Koivisto2018Integrin; Brzozowska2022Integrin).

The integrin αvβ6 is particularly important in modulating immune responses and maintaining epithelial cell quiescence. It activates TGF-β1, a cytokine that regulates anti-inflammatory responses and epithelial cell proliferation, thereby preventing excessive inflammation and conditions like emphysema in the lungs (Koivisto2018Integrin). In the gastrointestinal tract, αvβ6 integrin helps maintain the epithelial barrier and suppresses inflammation by inducing regulatory T cells (Koivisto2018Integrin).

In the context of wound healing, αvβ6 integrin is involved in tissue remodeling and epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, facilitating keratinocyte proliferation and re-epithelialization (Koivisto2018Integrin). The integrin also plays a role in maintaining the integrity of the junctional epithelium in the oral cavity, preventing periodontal disease (Koivisto2018Integrin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the ITGB6 gene, which encodes the integrin subunit beta 6, are associated with several diseases. In periodontal disease, downregulation of αvβ6 integrin leads to the formation of pockets between teeth and soft tissue, facilitating bacterial biofilm growth and increasing pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, such as interleukin-1β. This results in a more severe inflammatory response and is linked to advanced periodontal disease in humans (Koivisto2018Integrin). Loss-of-function mutations in ITGB6 are also associated with amelogenesis imperfecta, a condition characterized by enamel defects, including yellow pigment and reduced mineralization (Koivisto2018Integrin).

In cancer, high expression of αvβ6 integrin is linked to tumor invasion, metastasis, and reduced patient survival, making it a significant prognostic marker. This integrin can promote tumor progression by disrupting the balance of TGF-β1 signaling, which normally has anti-proliferative effects (Koivisto2018Integrin). ITGB6 is also implicated in fibrosis, where its expression increases in response to inflammation or trauma, contributing to ECM accumulation and fibrosis (Koivisto2018Integrin). In high-grade serous ovarian cancer, ITGB6 is hypermethylated in chemoresistant patients, suggesting a role in drug resistance pathways (Feng2021Abnormal).

## Interactions
The ITGB6 gene encodes the β6 subunit of the integrin αvβ6, which is involved in various cellular interactions. Integrin αvβ6 binds to proteins containing the RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) motif, with well-characterized ligands including fibronectin and the Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGF-β) pro-peptide, Latency Associated Peptide (LAP). The binding of αvβ6 to LAP exposes TGF-β1 to its receptors, activating TGF-β1 (Meecham2020The). The cytoplasmic tail of integrin β6 recruits signaling and structural partners such as HAX-1, Fyn, ERK2, and Kindlin-1, facilitating both 'outside-in' and 'inside-out' signaling (Meecham2020The; Holmes2011Comparative). 

The β6 subunit interacts with intracellular proteins through NPXY and NXXY motifs, which are recognition sequences for proteins with phosphotyrosine-binding domains (PTB), such as talin and kindlin (Holmes2011Comparative). These interactions are crucial for integrin activation and signaling. The phosphorylation state of tyrosine residues in these motifs can alter the binding affinities of proteins like talin and Dok1 (Holmes2011Comparative). 

In the context of disease, ITGB6 expression is upregulated in conditions such as pancreatic cancer, where it is associated with poor clinical outcomes and may serve as a prognostic biomarker (Zhong2021ITGB6).
