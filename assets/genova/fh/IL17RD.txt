# IL17RD

## Overview
IL17RD is a gene located on chromosome 3p14.3 in humans, encoding the interleukin 17 receptor D, a type I transmembrane protein. This protein is a member of the interleukin receptor family and plays a crucial role in modulating immune and inflammatory responses. Interleukin 17 receptor D is characterized by its complex structure, which includes an extracellular domain with immunoglobulin-like and fibronectin type III motifs, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain featuring a SEFIR segment and other signaling motifs. Functionally, it acts as a negative regulator of the NF-κB pathway and is involved in various signaling pathways, including those mediated by fibroblast growth factors and interleukin 17. IL17RD's interactions with other receptors and signaling molecules underscore its importance in cellular signaling and its potential implications in diseases such as cancer and idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (Zhang2024Clinical; Mellett2012Orphan; Pande2021Interleukin17).

## Structure
IL17RD, also known as interleukin 17 receptor D, is a type I transmembrane protein encoded by a single locus on chromosome 3p14.3 in humans. It consists of 739 amino acids, including a 26-residue signal peptide, a 272 amino acid extracellular domain, a 20 amino acid transmembrane domain, and a 420 amino acid intracellular domain (Pande2021Interleukin17). The extracellular domain features an immunoglobulin-like domain and a fibronectin type III repeat, with seven potential N-linked glycosylation sites and eight conserved cysteine residues (Pande2021Interleukin17). The intracellular domain includes a SEFIR segment, a TNF receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6) binding site, and a TIR subdomain with three conserved TIR binding motifs (Pande2021Interleukin17). 

IL17RD can exist in monomeric, dimeric, and oligomeric forms, interacting with various receptors such as FGFR1, FGFR2, IL17RA, TNFR2, TLR3, TLR4, and EGFR (Pande2021Interleukin17). The SEFIR domain is crucial for interactions with adapter proteins in signaling pathways, particularly through its conserved Box3 sequence (Pande2021Interleukin17). IL17RD has several isoforms, including hSEF-a, hSEF-b, and hSEF-S, which differ in their amino acid sequences and cellular localization (Pande2021Interleukin17).

## Function
IL17RD, also known as interleukin 17 receptor D, is a multi-functional regulator of cell signaling pathways in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in modulating inflammatory signaling, particularly those involving IL17A, by acting as a physiological receptor for IL17A and influencing the expression of IL17A target genes in keratinocytes (Pande2021Interleukin17). IL17RD can modulate IL17 signaling both in its homodimeric form and when forming a heterodimer with IL17RA, affecting pathways like p38 MAPK, ERK, JNK, and NF-κB (Pande2021Interleukin17). It acts as a negative regulator of the NF-κB pathway by sequestering the adaptor protein Act1, preventing its interaction with IL17RA and TRAF6, which are necessary for NF-κB activation (Mellett2012Orphan).

IL17RD is also involved in regulating receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways, particularly the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling pathway, by interacting with FGFR1 and FGFR2 to affect downstream effector molecules like RAF, MEK, and ERK (Pande2021Interleukin17). It serves as a scaffold for assembling receptor complexes and interacting proteins, influencing various signaling outputs (Pande2021Interleukin17). IL17RD's role extends to potentially interacting with other IL17 receptors, affecting signaling pathways downstream of other IL17 cytokines (Pande2021Interleukin17).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IL17RD gene are associated with various diseases and conditions. In cancer, IL17RD expression is inversely related to tumor aggressiveness in epithelial-origin tumors, such as those in the breast, prostate, thyroid, ovaries, and intestine. Ectopic expression of IL17RD can suppress metastatic transformation by affecting signaling pathways like FGF, EGF, and WNT, which influence carcinoma cell proliferation and migration (Pande2021Interleukin17). IL17RD also enhances the sensitivity of resistant metastatic lung cancer cells to MEK inhibitors and regulates chromosomal segregation in colorectal cancer by suppressing RAS-mediated polyploidy (Pande2021Interleukin17).

In the context of idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) and Kallmann syndrome (KS), IL17RD variants, such as c.2101G>A, p.Gly701Ser, have been implicated. These conditions are characterized by symptoms like hyposmia and hypogonadism, and IL17RD acts as a negative regulator in the FGF8-FGFR1 signaling pathway, crucial for olfactory and GnRH neuron development (Zhang2024Clinical; Men2020Prevalence). The presence of IL17RD variants often requires additional genetic factors to manifest the disease phenotype, suggesting an oligogenic mode of action (Men2020Prevalence).

## Interactions
IL17RD, also known as Sef, is a multifunctional protein that interacts with various signaling molecules, playing a significant role in modulating immune and inflammatory responses. It interacts with MyD88, a key adaptor protein in toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, through its SEFIR domain, inhibiting MyD88-mediated activation of NF-κB. This interaction is crucial for reducing TRAF6 polyubiquitination and modulating downstream signaling (Mellett2015Orphan; Pande2021Interleukin17). IL17RD also interacts with other TIR adaptors such as Mal and TRIF, but not directly with TLR4 and TLR3, indicating specificity in its interactions (Mellett2015Orphan).

In the context of IL-17 signaling, IL17RD interacts with IL-17R and Act1, inhibiting the interaction of Act1 with IL-17RA and TRAF6, which is essential for NF-κB activation. This suggests that IL17RD acts as a regulatory 'brake' in IL-17A signaling pathways (Mellett2012Orphan; Rong2008IL17RD). IL17RD also forms complexes with IL-17RB and colocalizes with IL-17R, affecting the localization and signaling of these receptors (Rong2008IL17RD).

Additionally, IL17RD interacts with TNFR2 via its extracellular domain and can form heterocomplexes with TNF-α and TNF receptors, enhancing TNF-α-induced proinflammatory responses (Pande2021Interleukin17; Liu2020A). These interactions highlight IL17RD's role as a critical modulator in various signaling pathways.
