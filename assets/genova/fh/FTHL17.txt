# FTHL17

## Overview
FTHL17 is a gene that encodes the protein ferritin heavy chain like 17, which is part of the ferritin family involved in iron storage and metabolism. Although the protein shares structural similarities with other ferritin family members, it does not directly participate in iron storage. Instead, FTHL17 is categorized as a cancer-germline gene, with its expression being notably upregulated in certain cancers, such as lung and bladder carcinomas (Loriot2003Five). The gene's expression is regulated by epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, and can be induced by demethylating agents, highlighting its potential role in tumor-specific antigen expression (Aoki2017DNA). Additionally, FTHL17 has been implicated in conditions related to iron metabolism, such as retinopathy of prematurity, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated (Luo2015Identification).

## Clinical Significance
The FTHL17 gene is implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its altered expression levels and epigenetic regulation. In cancer, FTHL17 is categorized as a cancer-germline gene, showing significant expression in tumors such as lung and bladder carcinomas, where it is often activated alongside MAGE genes (Loriot2003Five). Its expression is regulated by DNA methylation, and treatment with demethylating agents like 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine can induce its expression in both tumor and normal cells, suggesting a role in tumor-specific antigen expression (Loriot2003Five). 

In lung cancer cells, hypo-methylation of the FTHL17 promoter region is associated with increased expression, which may contribute to its role in cancer biology (Aoki2017DNA). The gene's expression is also linked to iron metabolism, as it is upregulated in conditions like retinopathy of prematurity, where dysregulation of iron homeostasis is a factor (Luo2015Identification). Despite its involvement in these conditions, the specific clinical significance of FTHL17 remains unclear, as its cellular roles are not fully understood, and it does not have a direct role in iron storage (Aoki2017DNA).
