# CEACAM20

## Overview
CEACAM20 is a gene that encodes the CEA cell adhesion molecule 20, a transmembrane protein belonging to the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family. This protein is characterized by its unique domain structure, which includes multiple immunoglobulin-like domains, and is predominantly expressed in the intestinal epithelium, particularly in the small intestine and colon. CEACAM20 plays a significant role in modulating immune responses and inflammation through its involvement in tyrosine phosphorylation and interaction with various kinases and phosphatases. The protein's activity is crucial for the regulation of chemokine production and the maintenance of intestinal immunity, with implications for conditions such as colitis. Dysregulation of CEACAM20, whether through genetic mutations or altered protein interactions, may contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (Murata2015Protein; Zebhauser2005Identification).

## Structure
CEACAM20 is a transmembrane protein predicted to have a unique domain structure within the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family, specifically N*-A1-B1-A2-B2-TM-Cyt. This structure includes a variant of the N domain, two A domains, two B domains, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain (Zebhauser2005Identification). The extracellular region of CEACAM20 contains four Ig-like domains, which are characteristic of the immunoglobulin superfamily (Murata2015Protein). The cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM20 includes four potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites, with two of these sites, Tyr 559 and Tyr 570, forming an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) (Murata2015Protein; Zebhauser2005Identification).

CEACAM20 is anchored to the cell membrane through its transmembrane domain (Han2020The). The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, such as tyrosine phosphorylation, which is mediated by Src family kinases and is important for its interaction with other proteins like spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) (Murata2015Protein). The ITAM motif in the cytoplasmic domain is conserved across species, indicating its functional importance (Zebhauser2005Identification). Specific details on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of CEACAM20 are not provided in the available literature.

## Function
CEACAM20 is a transmembrane protein predominantly expressed in the intestinal epithelium, particularly in the small intestine and colon. It is characterized by four Ig-like domains and four potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites, two of which form an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) (Murata2015Protein). CEACAM20 is involved in the regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation, acting as a substrate for the protein tyrosine phosphatase SAP-1. This interaction suggests a role in modulating cell signaling pathways related to immune responses and inflammation in the intestinal epithelium (Murata2015Protein).

In healthy cells, CEACAM20 undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation, which is enhanced by Src Family Kinases such as c-Src and Fyn. This phosphorylation allows CEACAM20 to bind specifically to the SH2 domains of the tyrosine kinase Syk, promoting the production of chemokines like IL-8 through the activation of the NF-κB pathway. This process is crucial for the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, indicating CEACAM20's role in immune and inflammatory responses (Murata2015Protein). CEACAM20's activity at the apical surface of colonic epithelial cells suggests its involvement in maintaining intestinal immunity and potentially protecting against conditions like colitis (Murata2015Protein).

## Clinical Significance
CEACAM20 is implicated in the regulation of intestinal immunity and inflammation, particularly in the context of colitis. Alterations in CEACAM20 expression or its interactions with other proteins, such as SAP-1, may be associated with inflammatory diseases of the intestine. In SAP-1-deficient mice, increased tyrosine phosphorylation of CEACAM20 is observed, suggesting that SAP-1 normally regulates CEACAM20 activity. This regulation is crucial for maintaining intestinal health, as the absence of SAP-1 leads to increased severity of colitis, characterized by up-regulation of cytokines and chemokines in the colon (Murata2015Protein).

CEACAM20, when phosphorylated, interacts with kinases such as c-Src and Syk, promoting the production of the chemokine IL-8 through the activation of the NF-κB pathway. This process is attenuated by SAP-1, indicating a protective role against excessive inflammatory responses. In a mouse model lacking both IL-10 and SAP-1, higher expression levels of chemokines KC and MIP-2 were noted, linking CEACAM20 activity to inflammatory conditions like colitis (Murata2015Protein).

These findings suggest that dysregulation of CEACAM20, whether through mutations, altered expression, or disrupted interactions, could contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases.

## Interactions
CEACAM20 is involved in several specific protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular signaling pathways. It is a substrate for Src family kinases (SFKs), with its tyrosine phosphorylation being enhanced by coexpression with c-Src or an activated form of Fyn, and inhibited by PP2, an SFK inhibitor (Murata2015Protein). CEACAM20 interacts specifically with the protein tyrosine phosphatase SAP-1, which reduces its tyrosine phosphorylation, indicating a regulatory role. This interaction is mediated via the ectodomains of both proteins and occurs even when mutant versions lacking the cytoplasmic region are coexpressed (Murata2015Protein).

CEACAM20 also forms a complex with spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) in HEK293A cells, leading to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk. This interaction is dependent on specific tyrosine residues (Y559 and Y570) in CEACAM20, which serve as binding sites for the SH2 domains of Syk. Mutations at these sites prevent the interaction (Murata2015Protein). Additionally, CEACAM20 does not bind to c-Src, Fyn, or the SFK-related protein Frk when it is tyrosine-phosphorylated, suggesting that its interactions are specific and influenced by its phosphorylation status (Murata2015Protein). These interactions play a significant role in promoting chemokine production through the activation of Nuclear Factor-κB (NF-κB) in intestinal epithelial cells (Murata2015Protein).
