# OTOS

## Overview
The OTOS gene encodes the protein otospiralin, which is predominantly expressed in the fibrocytes of the inner ear, particularly within the cochlea and vestibule. Otospiralin is a crucial protein involved in maintaining the structural integrity and function of cochlear fibrocytes, which are essential for normal auditory function. It plays a significant role in regulating the ionic and hydric balance of the endolymph, a fluid critical for hearing. The absence or downregulation of otospiralin can lead to moderate deafness and degeneration of specific fibrocyte types, although hair cells and the stria vascularis remain unaffected (Delprat2002Downregulation; Delprat2005Deafness). Additionally, otospiralin is implicated in protecting cochlear cells from damage and supporting the survival of the neurosensory epithelium, highlighting its protective role in auditory cell biology (Zhuo2008Adenoviralmediated).

## Function
Otospiralin, encoded by the OTOS gene, is a protein primarily expressed in the fibrocytes of the inner ear, particularly in the cochlea and vestibule. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of cochlear fibrocytes, which are essential for normal auditory function. The protein is involved in maintaining ionic and hydric balance in the endolymph, a fluid in the inner ear critical for hearing (Delprat2005Deafness). Otospiralin's expression is largely restricted to the inner ear, and its absence can lead to moderate deafness and degeneration of specific fibrocyte types, while hair cells and the stria vascularis remain unaffected (Delprat2005Deafness).

In cellular processes, otospiralin is implicated in supporting the survival of neurosensory epithelium and maintaining cochlear sensitivity. Its downregulation leads to hair cell degeneration and increased compound action potential (CAP) thresholds, reflecting outer hair cell dysfunction (Delprat2002Downregulation). The protein may influence the endolymph composition or directly affect hair cell functioning, possibly through secretion and interaction with the neuroepithelium (Delprat2002Downregulation). Otospiralin is also involved in protecting cochlear cells from damage, as its up-regulation has been shown to decrease apoptosis in spiral ligament fibrocytes, suggesting a protective role in cell biology (Zhuo2008Adenoviralmediated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the OTOS gene, which encodes the protein otospiralin, have been linked to various auditory dysfunctions. In mice, the deletion of the OTOS gene results in moderate deafness, characterized by increased compound action potential (CAP) thresholds across a range of frequencies, without affecting the hair cells or the stria vascularis. This suggests that otospiralin is essential for maintaining the integrity of cochlear fibrocytes, which are crucial for normal auditory function (Delprat2005Deafness).

In humans, genetic variations near the OTOS gene have been associated with an increased risk of cisplatin-induced tinnitus (CisIT) in testicular cancer survivors. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs7606353, located downstream of OTOS, is linked to a higher risk of CisIT, indicating that OTOS may play a protective role against cisplatin cytotoxicity (El2019Clinical). Additionally, decreased expression of OTOS has been correlated with increased susceptibility to CisIT, suggesting that higher OTOS expression may confer protection against tinnitus (El2019Clinical).

Research also indicates that OTOS may be involved in maintaining the ionic composition of the endolymph, which is crucial for hair cell survival, and its downregulation can lead to hair cell degeneration and deafness (Delprat2002Downregulation).
