# RPF1

## Overview
RPF1 (ribosome production factor 1 homolog) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the biogenesis of ribosomes, a fundamental process for cellular function and growth. The protein encoded by RPF1 is categorized as a ribosome production factor and plays a pivotal role in the maturation and processing of pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) within the nucleolus of human cells. It is particularly associated with the early stages of ribosome assembly, contributing to the formation of the pre-60S ribosomal subunit and facilitating the processing of specific rRNA precursors. RPF1 is part of the WDR74-module, which interacts with nucleolar particles to aid in the assembly of the 60S ribosomal subunit. Despite its critical role in ribosome biogenesis, the depletion of RPF1 does not significantly disrupt ribosome production or cell proliferation, as pre-60S particles can mature in the cytoplasm bypassing nuclear quality control (Deryabin2024Human).

## Function
RPF1 (ribosome production factor 1 homolog) is a crucial component in the biogenesis of ribosomes, particularly involved in the maturation and processing of pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) in human cells. It plays a significant role in the early stages of ribosome assembly, specifically in the processing of pre-rRNA and the assembly of pre-ribosomal particles (Deryabin2024Human). RPF1 is associated with the pre-60S ribosomal subunit and is involved in the processing of 27SA3 and 7S precursors, indicating its role in pre-rRNA cleavage and structural changes necessary for ribosome assembly (Deryabin2024Human).

RPF1 is part of the WDR74-module, which interacts with early nucleolar particles to facilitate the formation of the 60S ribosomal subunit. Although its depletion affects site 4 cleavage indirectly, it does not significantly disrupt ribosome biogenesis or cell proliferation, as pre-60S particles can bypass nuclear quality control and mature in the cytoplasm (Deryabin2024Human). The protein is active in the nucleolus, where it contributes to the production and function of ribosomes, essential for cell growth and proliferation (Deryabin2024Human). RPF1's involvement in ribosome biogenesis highlights its importance in maintaining cellular function and integrity.

## Interactions
RPF1, a ribosome production factor, is involved in several interactions crucial for ribosome biogenesis. In yeast, RPF1 interacts with the importins Kap120, Kap114, and Nmd5, which are essential for its nuclear import. These interactions are Ran-GTP dependent, indicating a typical import cargo behavior where RPF1 is released by Ran-GTP within the nucleus (Caesar2006Kap120). RPF1 is predominantly located in the nucleolus and is involved in the processing of 25S rRNA and the export of large ribosomal subunits (Caesar2006Kap120).

In humans, RPF1 is part of the WDR74-module, which interacts with the early nucleolar SSF1 particle to form the intermediate NSA1 nucleolar precursor. This interaction is important for the formation of mature 28S ribosomal RNA (Deryabin2024Human). RPF1 also co-sediments with the pre-60S ribosomal particle, indicating its direct involvement in the assembly of the pre-60S ribosomal subunit (Deryabin2024Human). These interactions highlight RPF1's role in the early stages of ribosome biogenesis, affecting pre-rRNA processing and ribosomal subunit assembly.
