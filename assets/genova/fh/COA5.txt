# COA5

## Overview
COA5 is a gene that encodes the protein cytochrome c oxidase assembly factor 5, which is integral to the assembly and function of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), also known as complex IV of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This protein is categorized as an assembly factor, playing a pivotal role in the biogenesis and stability of COX, which is essential for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production in eukaryotic cells. COA5 is localized within the mitochondria, where it interacts with COX subunits during the early stages of assembly, ensuring proper complex formation and function. Mutations in the COA5 gene can lead to severe mitochondrial disorders, such as cardiomyopathy and encephalocardiomyopathy, due to COX deficiency, highlighting its critical role in cellular energy metabolism and organismal energy homeostasis (Cerqua2021Mutations; Brischigliaro2021Cytochrome; Gladyck2021Regulation).

## Function
COA5, also known as PET191 or C2ORF64, is a crucial assembly factor for cytochrome c oxidase (COX), which is complex IV of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This protein is involved in the assembly and stability of COX, although its specific molecular function in this process remains to be fully elucidated. COA5 is active within the mitochondria, where it plays a significant role in maintaining the stability and function of COX, which is essential for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production in eukaryotic cells (Brischigliaro2021Cytochrome).

Mutations in COA5 can lead to severe COX deficiency, as evidenced by cases where individuals with a homozygous mutation in COA5 suffered from early-onset fatal cardiomyopathy due to impaired COX function. This highlights the importance of COA5 in ensuring the proper assembly and function of COX, which is vital for cellular energy metabolism and overall organismal energy homeostasis (Brischigliaro2021Cytochrome). The evolutionary conservation of COA5 and its yeast ortholog, pet191, underscores its fundamental role in the biogenesis of COX across different species (Brischigliaro2021Cytochrome).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the COA5 gene, also known as PET191 or C2ORF64, are linked to severe mitochondrial disorders, primarily affecting the heart and brain. These mutations result in cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiency, a condition that disrupts the mitochondrial respiratory chain, leading to impaired energy production. One notable mutation is the homozygous c.157G>C transversion, which changes a conserved alanine at position 53 to proline. This specific mutation has been associated with early-onset fatal cardiomyopathy, as observed in two siblings (Brischigliaro2021Cytochrome).

COA5 mutations are also implicated in early onset forms of fatal infantile encephalocardiomyopathy, a severe multisystem disorder characterized by neuromuscular and neurodegenerative features. This condition often presents with symptoms such as encephalopathy and cardiomyopathy, reflecting the gene's critical role in COX assembly and stability (Cerqua2021Mutations). The clinical phenotypes associated with COA5 mutations are similar to those caused by mutations in other COX assembly factors, often leading to early onset encephalocardiomyopathy or multisystem disorders (Cerqua2021Mutations). These findings underscore the importance of COA5 in maintaining mitochondrial function and highlight the severe consequences of its dysfunction.

## Interactions
COA5, also known as cytochrome c oxidase assembly factor 5, is involved in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. In yeast, COA5, referred to as Pet191p, is localized to the mitochondrial intermembrane space and is crucial for COX activity. It has been shown to interact with itself, as demonstrated by dual expression and pulldown experiments, indicating a potential role in forming homomeric complexes (Gladyck2021Regulation).

In humans, COA5 is implicated in the early stages of COX assembly, where it interacts with COX I during an intermediate assembly step. This interaction is essential for the proper assembly and function of the COX complex. A rare mutation in COA5, A53P, is associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and leads to COX deficiency. This mutation affects the levels of COX subunits, which can be restored by expressing wild-type COA5, suggesting that COA5's interaction with COX I is critical for maintaining COX subunit stability and function (Gladyck2021Regulation).

The specific interactions of COA5 with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond these findings are not detailed in the available literature, indicating a need for further research to fully elucidate its interaction network.
