# HMGCR

## Overview
The HMGCR gene encodes the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, a key transmembrane enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of cholesterol through the mevalonate pathway. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, a rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis, and is located in the endoplasmic reticulum of human cells (Reynolds1984HMG; Jo2010Control). The activity of HMGCR is tightly regulated by feedback mechanisms involving cholesterol and other metabolic end products, as well as by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation processes (Burg2011Regulation). The enzyme's interactions with proteins such as Insig-1, Insig-2, and gp78 are crucial for its degradation in response to sterol levels, ensuring cholesterol homeostasis (Song2005Gp78). Mutations or alterations in HMGCR expression can have significant clinical implications, including impacts on liver function, cancer prognosis, and developmental processes (Borgquist2008Prognostic; EisaBeygi2014Developmental; Nagashima2012LiverSpecific).

## Structure
The human HMGCR protein is a transmembrane enzyme involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, featuring a complex structure with distinct domains. The primary structure includes multiple transmembrane helices, with the amino-terminal region acting as a signal sequence for targeting the enzyme to the endoplasmic reticulum (Olender1992The). The secondary structure is characterized by alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to the enzyme's stability and function (Olender1992The).

The tertiary structure of HMGCR involves a bilobed catalytic domain, which is highly conserved among eukaryotes. This domain includes subdomains such as the N domain, L domain, and S domain, which are responsible for binding HMG-CoA and NADP(H) (Friesen2004The3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzymeA(HMGCoA)reductases page 0 of 2). The quaternary structure of the enzyme is a tetramer composed of identical units, with the active site located at the interface of the homodimer (Friesen2004The3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzymeA(HMGCoA)reductases page 0 of 2).

Post-translational modifications, such as reversible phosphorylation at serine 872, play a crucial role in regulating the enzyme's activity (Friesen2004The3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzymeA(HMGCoA)reductases page 0 of 2). The enzyme's structure is distinct from bacterial counterparts, which lack the membrane-anchor and linker domains (Friesen2004The3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzymeA(HMGCoA)reductases page 0 of 2).

## Function
The HMGCR gene encodes the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, which plays a pivotal role in the mevalonate pathway, a crucial metabolic pathway for cholesterol biosynthesis in human cells. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, a rate-limiting step in the synthesis of cholesterol and other isoprenoids, which are essential for normal cell function (Reynolds1984HMG; Jo2010Control). HMGCR is an integral membrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it functions as a transmembrane glycoprotein (Lindgren1985Human).

The enzyme's activity is tightly regulated to maintain cholesterol homeostasis. It is subject to feedback inhibition by cholesterol and other end products of the metabolic pathway, which suppress its activity by inhibiting the transcription rate of the HMGCR gene (Reynolds1984HMG). Additionally, HMGCR is regulated through phosphorylation by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which decreases its activity, and dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which restores its activity (Burg2011Regulation). This regulation ensures that cholesterol synthesis is balanced with the cell's needs and external cholesterol sources, such as plasma lipoproteins (Reynolds1984HMG).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the HMGCR gene can have significant clinical implications. In liver-specific deletion studies in mice, the absence of HMGCR led to severe hepatic steatosis and high mortality rates, particularly in males. This condition was characterized by decreased cholesterol synthesis, increased fatty acid synthesis, and severe liver damage, highlighting the gene's critical role in maintaining liver function and lipid metabolism (Nagashima2012LiverSpecific). 

In the context of cancer, HMGCR expression has been linked to tumor characteristics and patient prognosis. In breast cancer, HMGCR expression is associated with favorable outcomes in estrogen receptor-positive tumors, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker. However, in estrogen receptor-negative tumors, the expression may correlate with a poorer prognosis, indicating a complex relationship between HMGCR expression and cancer progression (Borgquist2008Prognostic).

HMGCR also plays a role in developmental processes. Disruptions in the HMGCR pathway can lead to developmental defects, as cholesterol is essential for cell membrane integrity and acts as a precursor for other steroids. These disruptions can impair signaling pathways critical for development, such as the sonic hedgehog pathway, leading to abnormalities (EisaBeygi2014Developmental).

## Interactions
HMGCR interacts with several proteins that regulate its degradation, particularly in response to sterol levels. A key interaction is with Insig-1 and Insig-2, ER membrane proteins that facilitate the ubiquitination and degradation of HMGCR when sterol levels are high. This process involves the E3 ubiquitin ligase gp78, which forms a complex with Insig-1 and HMGCR, leading to the ubiquitination of HMGCR and its subsequent degradation by the proteasome (Song2005Gp78).

The interaction between HMGCR and Insig-1 is enhanced by the presence of sterols such as 25-hydroxycholesterol, which promotes the formation of a ternary complex with gp78, marking HMGCR for degradation (Song2005Gp78). VCP, an ATPase, also plays a role in this process by extracting ubiquitinated HMGCR from the ER membrane, facilitating its degradation (Song2005Gp78).

HMGCR also interacts with UBIAD1, a protein that inhibits its degradation. This interaction is mediated by transmembrane helices and is disrupted by the accumulation of GGpp, which causes UBIAD1 to dissociate from HMGCR, allowing for its degradation (Chen2022Regulated). These interactions are crucial for the regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis and homeostasis.
