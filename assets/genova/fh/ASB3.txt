# ASB3

## Overview
The ASB3 gene encodes the ankyrin repeat and SOCS box containing 3 protein, which is a crucial component of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This protein is characterized by its ankyrin repeat domains and a SOCS box, which facilitate its role as part of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. The ankyrin repeats enable protein-protein interactions, particularly with tumor necrosis factor receptor II (TNF-R2), while the SOCS box is essential for recruiting components necessary for ubiquitination and degradation of target proteins (Anasa2018Multifaceted; Chung2005Ankyrin). ASB3 is involved in regulating signaling pathways associated with inflammation and apoptosis, and its dysfunction has been implicated in various diseases, including colorectal cancer and glioblastoma multiforme, where it may act as a tumor suppressor (Mu2022Pancancer; Du2017The). Additionally, ASB3 plays a role in modulating immune responses, highlighting its significance in both cancer biology and immune regulation (Cheng2023E3).

## Structure
The ASB3 protein is composed of 518 amino acids and features a series of ankyrin (ANK) repeats and a SOCS box domain. The ankyrin repeats, numbering between 11 and 12, form helix-turn-helix motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions. These repeats create a stabilizing platform and are involved in the interaction with tumor necrosis factor receptor II (TNF-R2) (Chung2005Ankyrin; Mu2022Pancancer). The SOCS box domain, located at the C-terminal end of the protein, is crucial for forming an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex by recruiting Elongins-B/C and Cul2, which are essential for the ubiquitination and degradation of target proteins (Anasa2018Multifaceted; Chung2005Ankyrin).

The ankyrin repeats in ASB3 are characterized by a tightly conserved secondary structure, forming V-shaped helix-turn-helix motifs that stack into bundles (Chung2005Ankyrin). The SOCS box domain contains a BC box with a consensus sequence that facilitates binding to Elongin-C, sharing conserved residues with other SOCS family members (Chung2005Ankyrin). ASB3 has been identified to have three transcriptional variants encoding two isoforms, which may influence its function in different cellular contexts (Mu2022Pancancer).

## Function
The ASB3 gene encodes a protein that is integral to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, functioning as part of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This complex is responsible for tagging specific proteins, such as tumor necrosis factor receptor II (TNF-R2), for degradation. In healthy human cells, ASB3 plays a crucial role in regulating TNF-R2-mediated signaling pathways, which are involved in cellular responses to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) (Chung2005Ankyrin).

ASB3 contains ankyrin repeat sequences and a SOCS box domain, which are essential for its function. The ankyrin repeats facilitate protein-protein interactions, allowing ASB3 to bind to the C-terminal region of TNF-R2. The SOCS box domain recruits Elongin-B/C, part of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, leading to the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of TNF-R2 (Chung2005Ankyrin).

By mediating the degradation of TNF-R2, ASB3 negatively regulates the Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) signaling pathway, which is associated with apoptosis and inflammation. This regulatory function is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and modulating inflammatory responses (Anasa2018Multifaceted; Chung2005Ankyrin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ASB3 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in colorectal cancer (CRC) and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). In CRC, ASB3 mutations, including missense, nonsense, and splice site mutations, occur in approximately 5.3% of cases. These mutations, along with down-regulation of ASB3 expression, contribute to increased cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastasis, indicating a loss of its tumor-suppressive function (Du2017The). Wild-type ASB3 inhibits these processes, suggesting that its dysfunction plays a role in CRC pathogenesis (Anasa2018Multifaceted).

In GBM, ASB3 expression is downregulated, and its low expression is associated with poor prognosis. ASB3 is involved in modulating the immune microenvironment, with its expression negatively correlated with immunosuppressive factors such as regulatory T cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts. Overexpression of ASB3 may reduce these immunosuppressive elements, potentially enhancing anti-tumor immune responses (Mu2022Pancancer).

ASB3 also plays a role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by interacting with TRAF6, leading to increased inflammation. ASB3 deficiency in mouse models results in reduced colonic inflammation and altered intestinal microbiota, suggesting its involvement in IBD pathogenesis (Cheng2023ASB3).

## Interactions
ASB3 interacts with several proteins, primarily through its ankyrin repeat and SOCS box domains. The ankyrin repeats of ASB3 facilitate its interaction with the tumor necrosis factor receptor II (TNF-R2), specifically targeting the C-terminal 37 amino acids of TNF-R2. This interaction is crucial for the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of TNF-R2, which affects TNF-R2-mediated signaling pathways, including the inhibition of Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) activation (Chung2005Ankyrin).

ASB3 also forms a complex with Elongin-B/C, Cullin, and Rbx-1, which constitutes an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. The SOCS box domain of ASB3 is essential for binding to Elongin-C, a component of this complex, facilitating the ubiquitination of TNF-R2 (Chung2005Ankyrin).

In the context of antiviral immunity, ASB3 interacts with the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), leading to its K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation. This interaction downregulates the IFN-I response, highlighting ASB3's role in modulating antiviral signaling pathways (Cheng2023E3). ASB3 does not interact with other proteins such as TRAF3, cGAS, or STING, indicating a specific interaction with MAVS (Cheng2023E3).
