# GPC5

## Overview
GPC5, or glypican 5, is a gene that encodes a member of the glypican family of heparan sulfate proteoglycans, which are characterized by their attachment to the cell surface via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. The protein product, glypican 5, plays a crucial role in modulating various cellular signaling pathways, including the Hedgehog and Wnt/β-catenin pathways, through its interactions with glycosaminoglycan chains. These interactions are vital for processes such as cell differentiation, proliferation, and migration. Glypican 5 is involved in both promoting and inhibiting tumor growth, depending on the cellular context, and has been implicated in diseases such as lung adenocarcinoma, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma. Additionally, genetic variants in the GPC5 gene have been associated with multiple sclerosis, highlighting its significance in both oncological and neurological contexts (Li2011Glypican5; Filmus2014The; Yuan2016GPC5).

## Structure
Glypican-5 (GPC5) is a member of the glypican family of heparan sulfate proteoglycans, characterized by a core protein linked to the cell surface via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. The primary structure of GPC5 includes a 572-amino-acid core protein with five predicted heparan sulfate (HS) chains attached at specific serine residues: S441, S486, S495, S507, and S509 (Li2020The). These glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains, which include both HS and chondroitin sulfate (CS) chains, are crucial for GPC5's interactions with other proteins, such as Patched-1 (Ptc1) in the Hedgehog signaling pathway (Li2011Glypican5).

The secondary and tertiary structures of GPC5 are not explicitly detailed, but glypicans generally have a conserved structure with 14 cysteine residues, suggesting a similar three-dimensional framework across the family (Filmus2014The). The GAG chain insertion sites are located near the C-terminus, close to the cell surface, which is typical for glypicans (Filmus2001Glypicans). Post-translational modifications include glycosylation and the addition of the GPI anchor, which are essential for its membrane attachment and function (Li2011Glypican5). The presence of both HS and CS chains in GPC5, particularly in rhabdomyosarcoma cells, highlights its role in cell signaling and proliferation (Filmus20123.7).

## Function
Glypican-5 (GPC5) is a heparan sulfate proteoglycan that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in cell motility and signaling pathways. In human mesenchymal stem cells, GPC5 is involved in fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-induced migration by localizing to the leading edge of migrating cells and participating in the FGFR1 signaling pathway, which activates Rac1 to promote cell movement (Takeuchi2021Subcellular). GPC5 also colocalizes with Rab11 and ARF6, indicating its involvement in recycling endosomal dynamics and vesicular transport (Takeuchi2021Subcellular).

GPC5 is released into the extracellular environment via extracellular vesicles (EVs), which can be taken up by other cells, suggesting a role in intercellular communication (Takeuchi2021Subcellular). During cell division, GPC5 accumulates at the equatorial plane and midbody, suggesting a potential role in cytokinesis (Takeuchi2021Subcellular).

In the context of signaling pathways, GPC5 is known to enhance Hedgehog (Hh) signaling by increasing the binding of Hh to its receptor, Patched, through its glycosaminoglycan chains (Filmus20123.7). This activity is crucial for processes such as cell differentiation and morphogenesis.

## Clinical Significance
GPC5 (glypican 5) has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression and interactions. In lung adenocarcinoma, GPC5 acts as a tumor suppressor and is often epigenetically silenced through hypermethylation, leading to its downregulation. This downregulation is associated with poor patient outcomes, as GPC5 normally inhibits the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for controlling cell proliferation and tumor growth (Yuan2016GPC5). In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), low GPC5 expression is linked to increased tumor cell proliferation and invasion, suggesting its role in suppressing cancer progression by modulating the Wnt pathway (Furini2021Expression).

In multiple sclerosis (MS), genetic variants in the GPC5 gene, such as the rs10492503 polymorphism, have been associated with the age of onset and response to treatment, indicating a potential role in the disease's pathogenesis and treatment response (Chorąży2019Analysis). In rhabdomyosarcoma, GPC5 is overexpressed and stimulates cell proliferation by activating the Hedgehog signaling pathway, highlighting its contrasting role as a promoter of tumor growth in this context (Li2011Glypican5).

## Interactions
Glypican-5 (GPC5) is involved in several key protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. In lung adenocarcinoma, GPC5 interacts with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by binding directly to the Wnt3a protein at the cell surface. This interaction reduces the colocalization of Wnt3a with Frizzled8, thereby inhibiting the Wnt pathway and suppressing tumor growth (Yuan2016GPC5). GPC5 also interacts with the AhR-ARNT signaling pathway, where its overexpression leads to the nuclear translocation of AhR, reducing the interaction between β-catenin and AhR or ARNT, and activating the CTDSP1 promoter, which is crucial for inhibiting cell proliferation in lung cancer (Yang2021GPC5).

In rhabdomyosarcoma, GPC5 stimulates Hedgehog (Hh) signaling by facilitating the binding of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) to Patched-1 (Ptc1). This interaction is mediated by GPC5's glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains, particularly heparan sulfate (HS) chains, which enhance the binding of Shh to Ptc1, thereby promoting cell proliferation (Li2011Glypican5). GPC5's role in these interactions highlights its function as a modulator of key signaling pathways involved in cancer progression.
