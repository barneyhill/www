# GJB2

## Overview
The GJB2 gene encodes the gap junction protein beta 2, commonly known as connexin 26 (Cx26), which is a transmembrane protein integral to the formation of gap junctions. These junctions are essential for direct intercellular communication, allowing the passage of ions and small molecules between adjacent cells. Connexin 26 is particularly significant in the auditory system, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining the ionic composition necessary for hearing. Mutations in the GJB2 gene are a leading cause of nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss, with various mutations linked to different degrees of hearing impairment and, in some cases, syndromic conditions. The study of GJB2 and its encoded protein, Cx26, continues to provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying hearing and the genetic basis of hearing loss (Kenneson2002GJB2; Richard2003Connexin; Zelante1997Connexin26).

## Structure
The GJB2 gene encodes the connexin 26 (Cx26) protein, which is a transmembrane protein involved in forming gap junctions that facilitate intercellular communication. The primary structure of Cx26 consists of 226 amino acids (Posukh2023Functional). Its secondary structure includes four alpha-helical transmembrane domains (TM1-TM4) and two extracellular loops (EL1 and EL2) (Posukh2023Functional; Yilmaz2014Bioinformatic). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices into a compact form, with the N-terminal region (NT) forming a funnel-like structure at the cytoplasmic pore entrance (Posukh2023Functional). 

The quaternary structure of Cx26 is characterized by the assembly of six subunits into a hexameric hemichannel, or connexon, which can dock with connexons from neighboring cells to form intercellular channels (Posukh2023Functional; Yilmaz2014Bioinformatic). Cx26 can oligomerize with Cx30 to form heteromeric and heterotypic gap junction channels (Posukh2023Functional). 

Post-translational modifications of Cx26 include acetylation, hydroxylation, and phosphorylation, primarily at the N-terminus, although the C-terminal domain is not phosphorylated (Posukh2023Functional). These structural features are crucial for the protein's function in facilitating ion and small molecule exchange between cells.

## Function
The GJB2 gene encodes the protein connexin 26 (Cx26), which is integral to the formation of gap junctions in cell membranes. These gap junctions are intercellular channels that facilitate direct communication between adjacent cells by allowing the passage of ions and small molecules, such as second messenger signaling molecules. Each gap junction channel is composed of two hemichannels, or connexons, each made up of six connexin subunits (Choi2009Different).

Connexin 26 is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and is particularly important in the cochlea, where it plays a vital role in auditory function. It is involved in the recycling of potassium ions (K+) between the endolymph and perilymph, which is essential for normal hearing. This process is necessary for the proper functioning of hair cells and maintaining the endocochlear electrical potential (Richard2003Connexin). Connexin 26 is expressed in various cell types within the cochlea, including fibrocytes of the spiral ligament and spiral limbus, basal cells of the stria vascularis, and supporting cells in the organ of Corti (Choi2009Different).

Mutations in the GJB2 gene can disrupt these functions, leading to hearing loss and other disorders (Richard2003Connexin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GJB2 gene, which encodes the protein connexin 26, are primarily associated with nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss, particularly the autosomal recessive form known as DFNB1. This condition is characterized by varying degrees of hearing impairment, often prelingual, and is the most common genetic cause of hearing loss in many populations (Kenneson2002GJB2; Zelante1997Connexin26). The 35delG mutation is notably prevalent, especially in Mediterranean populations, accounting for a significant proportion of cases (Kenneson2002GJB2; Zelante1997Connexin26). Other mutations, such as 167delT and V37I, are more common in specific ethnic groups, including Ashkenazi Jews and Asians, respectively (Snoeckx2005GJB2).

GJB2 mutations can also lead to syndromic conditions like Vohwinkel syndrome, which combines sensorineural hearing loss with palmoplantar keratoderma (Kenneson2002GJB2). The pathogenicity of GJB2 mutations varies, with truncating mutations generally causing more severe hearing loss than nontruncating ones (Snoeckx2005GJB2). Some mutations, such as M34T, have been associated with both dominant and recessive forms of hearing loss, indicating complex inheritance patterns (Snoeckx2005GJB2; Wilcox2000High).

## Interactions
Connexin 26 (Cx26), encoded by the GJB2 gene, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in forming gap junctions. Cx26 interacts with several proteins associated with cell junctions and the cytoskeleton, including cingulin (CGN), disheveled-associated activator of morphogenesis 1 (DAAM1), filamin B (FLNB), and tight junction protein 1 (TJP1) (Batissoco2018A). These interactions suggest that Cx26 is part of a larger protein network that integrates with the cytoskeleton and other membrane junction components (Batissoco2018A).

Cx26 has been shown to co-localize with TJP1 at the plasma membrane of hepatocytes, indicating a potential interaction with tight junction proteins (Batissoco2018A). Although direct interactions between Cx26 and TJP1 were not confirmed, indirect interactions through adaptor proteins like CGN are suggested (Batissoco2018A). Additionally, Cx26 interacts with other connexins, such as Cx30 and Cx43, forming heteromeric channels that enhance intercellular communication (Beach2020GJB2).

The study of Cx26 mutants has revealed that certain mutations can affect its ability to form functional gap junctions, highlighting the importance of these protein interactions for proper trafficking and function (Beach2020GJB2).
