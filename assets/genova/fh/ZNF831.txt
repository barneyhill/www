# ZNF831

## Overview
ZNF831 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 831, a transcription factor belonging to the zinc finger protein family. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger motifs, which enable it to bind specific DNA sequences and regulate gene expression. ZNF831 plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and development, by modulating the transcription of target genes. It is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it influences the expression of genes essential for maintaining normal cellular functions. The gene has been implicated in immune cell activity, particularly in natural killer cells, and is associated with metabolic processes and various diseases, including cancers and immune-related conditions (Bandesh2019Genomewide; Wang2014Molecular).

## Structure


## Function
ZNF831, a member of the zinc finger protein family, functions primarily as a transcription factor, playing a crucial role in regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. This protein is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which facilitate its DNA-binding capability. ZNF831 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and development, by modulating the transcription of target genes. It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences the expression of genes critical for maintaining normal cellular functions (Wang2014Molecular).

In the context of natural killer (NK) cells, ZNF831 is overexpressed in mature peripheral NK (mpNK) cells compared to immature decidual NK (idNK) cells. This suggests a potential role in the cytotoxic activity of NK cells, although the precise functions of ZNF831 in these cells remain to be fully elucidated (Wang2014Molecular). Additionally, ZNF831 has been identified as a significant signal in genome-wide association studies related to plasma C-peptide levels, indicating its involvement in metabolic processes (Bandesh2019Genomewide). Despite these findings, the specific molecular activities and organismal outcomes of ZNF831 in healthy human cells require further investigation to be comprehensively understood.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF831 has been implicated in various cancers and immune-related conditions. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), ZNF831 is part of a four-gene signature that correlates with CD4+ T cell infiltration and immunosuppression markers such as PD1 and PD-L1. This signature is used to predict overall survival in PDAC patients, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker (Tan2021Analysis). In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), ZNF831 is identified as a significant transcription factor within the Immunity High subtype, suggesting its role in regulating immune responses and potentially influencing patient prognosis (He2018Classification).

ZNF831 mutations have also been observed in hypopharyngeal cancer, although the specific clinical implications of these mutations remain unclear (Yao2023Application). In the context of antipsychotic medication side effects, ZNF831 showed potential association with extrapyramidal symptoms, though it did not reach genomewide significance (Åberg2010Genomewide). These findings suggest that alterations in ZNF831, whether through mutations or changes in expression, may contribute to the pathogenesis of various diseases, particularly those involving immune system dysregulation.
