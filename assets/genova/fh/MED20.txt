# MED20

## Overview
MED20 is a gene that encodes the protein mediator complex subunit 20, which is a critical component of the Mediator complex involved in the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. The MED20 protein is part of the head module of the Mediator complex and forms a heterodimer with Med18, contributing to the Med8/18/20 subcomplex. This subcomplex plays a significant role in the assembly and stability of the transcription initiation complex, facilitating interactions with transcriptional activators and general transcription factors such as TBP and TFIIB (Borggrefe2011Interactions; Larivière2006Structure). MED20 is essential for both basal and activated transcription, although it is not required for yeast viability, underscoring its importance in transcriptional regulation across species (Larivière2006Structure). Additionally, MED20 has been implicated in various biological processes, including neurodevelopment and plant defense responses, highlighting its diverse functional roles (Fallath2017MEDIATOR18; CaroLlopis2016De).

## Structure
The MED20 protein is a component of the Mediator complex, which plays a crucial role in transcription regulation by RNA polymerase II. Structurally, MED20 forms a heterodimer with Med18, characterized by pseudo two-fold symmetry. This heterodimer is part of the Med8/18/20 subcomplex within the Mediator head module (Larivière2006Structure). MED20 adopts a fold similar to Med18, consisting of an eight-stranded beta-barrel with a central pore and three flanking helices. An additional C-terminal helix in MED20 fills the central pore, acting as a wedge (Larivière2006Structure).

The interaction between Med18 and Med20 is primarily hydrophobic, involving the a2 helices of both subunits and the b5 strands at the opening of the Med20 barrel (Larivière2006Structure). The Med8 protein's C-terminal region forms an alpha-helix that binds across the top of the Med18 barrel, mainly through hydrophobic contacts, without altering the free Med18/20 structure (Larivière2006Structure).

The Med18-Med20 interaction has a large interface, which is crucial for the stability of the transcription initiation complex and efficient transcription (Larivière2006Structure). The Med8/18/20 complex is conserved across species, with many residues in the subunit-subunit interfaces being conserved (Larivière2006Structure).

## Function
MED20 is a subunit of the Mediator complex, a crucial coactivator in eukaryotic transcription that facilitates the interaction between RNA polymerase II and transcription factors. The Mediator complex, including MED20, is involved in various transcriptional processes such as RNA polymerase II recruitment, phosphorylation, and enhancer-loop formation, which are essential for transcription initiation and regulation (Borggrefe2011Interactions). MED20, as part of the Mediator head module, interacts with transcriptional activators and general transcription factors like TBP (TATA box-binding protein) and TFIIB, playing a significant role in the assembly of the transcription initiation complex (Larivière2006Structure).

The MED20 subunit forms a heterodimer with Med18, characterized by a b-barrel fold, and is part of the Med8/18/20 subcomplex. This subcomplex is suggested to have a positive role in initiation-complex formation, which is crucial for efficient basal transcription (Larivière2006Structure). The structure of the Med8/18/20 complex is conserved across species, indicating its fundamental role in cellular processes (Larivière2006Structure). Although MED20 is not essential for yeast viability, it is necessary for both basal and activated transcription in vivo, highlighting its importance in transcriptional regulation (Larivière2006Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MED20 gene have been linked to significant neurodegenerative disorders. A homozygous transversion in MED20 was identified in two sisters from a consanguineous Austrian family, leading to infantile-onset basal ganglia degeneration and brain atrophy. These conditions were characterized by severely delayed psychomotor development, spasticity, and dystonia, indicating that MED20 mutations can result in severe neurodevelopmental issues (CaroLlopis2016De).

Alterations in MED20 expression levels can also impact cellular functions. In yeast models, inefficient splicing of MED20 pre-mRNA due to mutations in the pre-mRNA retention and splicing (RES) complex leads to growth defects. This is particularly evident in bud13Δ and snu17Δ mutants, where reduced Med20 protein levels contribute to these defects. Introducing an intron-less MED20 allele can restore normal growth phenotypes, highlighting the importance of proper MED20 splicing for cellular function (Zhou2017The).

In plants, MED20, along with MED18, has been implicated in modulating defense responses. Mutations in these genes in Arabidopsis thaliana lead to increased susceptibility to Fusarium oxysporum infection, suggesting a role in regulating salicylic acid-associated defense genes and reactive oxygen species management (Fallath2017MEDIATOR18).

## Interactions
MED20 is a component of the Mediator complex, specifically part of the head module, where it interacts with other subunits such as Med8 and Med18. These interactions are crucial for the proper folding and assembly of the Mediator head module. Med20 forms a heterodimer with Med18, characterized by a large hydrophobic interface, and this dimer is essential for the formation of a functional trimeric complex with Med8 (Adler2009Med8; Larivière2006Structure). The Med8/18/20 subcomplex is anchored to the head module through interactions with Med17, although the Med20-Med17 interaction alone is not sufficient to retain Med20 within the complex (Larivière2006Structure).

Med20 also interacts with the TATA-binding protein (TBP), although this interaction is weaker compared to Med8's interaction with TBP. This interaction is important for maintaining a stable transcription initiation complex at the promoter, which is activator-dependent and modulated by transcriptional activators like Gal4VP16 (Larivière2006Structure). Additionally, Med20 is involved in the transcriptional repression of ribosomal protein genes, potentially functioning independently of the Mediator complex in this role (Willis2008Genetic). These interactions highlight Med20's role in both structural assembly within the Mediator complex and functional regulation of transcription.
