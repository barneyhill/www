# NPIPB15

## Overview
The NPIPB15 gene encodes the nuclear pore complex interacting protein family member B15, a protein that is part of a family known for its interactions with the nuclear pore complex. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of nucleocytoplasmic transport, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Although the specific functions of NPIPB15 are still being elucidated, its involvement in cellular transport mechanisms suggests it may play a role in the regulation of gene expression and signal transduction. Recent studies have highlighted the potential clinical significance of NPIPB15, particularly in the context of cancer, where mutations in this gene have been associated with colorectal cancer, T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, and sinonasal basaloid carcinoma (Hoch2024Integrated; Zhao2022Comprehensive; Mikhaylenko2022Computational). Further research is required to fully understand the biological and pathological roles of NPIPB15.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
NPIPB15 has been implicated in several types of cancer, suggesting its potential clinical significance. In colorectal cancer (CRC), NPIPB15 was identified as one of the eight genes mutated in 14.9% of patients, indicating a possible role in CRC tumorigenesis or progression. These mutations have not been previously reported in major cancer databases, highlighting the novelty of these findings (Zhao2022Comprehensive).

In T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL), NPIPB15 is noted for its potential role in contributing to the differences observed between molecular subgroups. The gene's increased network connectivity may influence cell proliferation and immune responses in a subgroup-specific manner, which could impact the development and progression of T-PLL (Mikhaylenko2022Computational).

NPIPB15 has also been associated with sinonasal basaloid carcinoma (SBC), where recurrent somatic variants, including mutations in NPIPB15, have been discovered. These mutations are part of the genetic irregularities that characterize SBC, suggesting a role in its pathology (Hoch2024Integrated).

While these studies highlight the potential involvement of NPIPB15 in various cancers, specific clinical implications of its mutations or expression alterations remain to be fully elucidated. Further research is needed to understand the precise role of NPIPB15 in these diseases.
