# GPC6

## Overview
GPC6, or glypican 6, is a gene that encodes the glypican 6 protein, a member of the glypican family of heparan sulfate proteoglycans. These proteins are characterized by their attachment to the cell surface via a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, which facilitates their role in modulating cell signaling pathways. Glypican 6 is involved in various cellular processes, including proliferation, adhesion, migration, and differentiation, by interacting with growth factors and morphogens. It acts as a co-receptor in pathways such as Wnt and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling, which are crucial for developmental processes and morphogenesis (DINCCELIKASLAN2015Diagnostic; Filmus2001Glypicans). The protein's expression is notably significant during development and in certain pathological conditions, including cancer and congenital heart defects, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (DINCCELIKASLAN2015Diagnostic; Tenin2021Glypican6).

## Structure
Glypican 6 (GPC6) is a member of the glypican family of heparan sulfate proteoglycans, characterized by a core protein linked to the cell membrane via a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. The primary structure of GPC6 includes a core protein with heparan sulfate (HS) chains attached near the C-terminus, which are crucial for its interactions with signaling molecules (Filmus20123.7; Filmus2001Glypicans). The core protein is approximately 60 to 70 kDa in size and contains a conserved pattern of 14 cysteine residues, suggesting a similar three-dimensional structure to other glypicans (Filmus2001Glypicans).

The secondary and tertiary structures of GPC6 are influenced by these cysteine residues, which likely form disulfide bonds, contributing to a stable, densely packed protein structure. Although specific structural details for GPC6 are not provided, glypicans generally exhibit a one-domain structure with α-helices and loops, as seen in GPC1 (Filmus20123.7).

GPC6 does not have a quaternary structure, as it functions as a monomer. Common post-translational modifications include glycosylation and GPI anchoring, which are essential for its membrane attachment and functional interactions (Awad2015Structural).

## Function
Glypican 6 (GPC6) is a member of the glypican family, which are heparan sulfate proteoglycans attached to the cell surface via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. These proteins are primarily involved in regulating growth factor and morphogen activity by modulating ligand-receptor interactions. GPC6, like other glypicans, plays a crucial role in cellular processes such as proliferation, adhesion, migration, and differentiation by interacting with extracellular and cytoplasmic ligands (DINCCELIKASLAN2015Diagnostic; Filmus20123.7).

GPC6 is predominantly expressed during development and is involved in morphogenesis, acting as a co-receptor for growth factors like fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and Wnt. This function is essential for growth factor-mediated signal transduction, facilitating the formation of ligand-receptor complexes (DINCCELIKASLAN2015Diagnostic). Glypicans, including GPC6, are also involved in the secretion and transport of peptides between cells, which is facilitated by mechanisms such as the release from the cell surface by the lipase Notum and apical-basolateral transcytosis (Filmus20123.7).

In the context of cancer, GPC6 is expressed in tumoral microenvironments and can exert both pro- and anti-tumorigenic effects. Its expression is significantly higher in gastric tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, suggesting its involvement in gastric cancer development (DINCCELIKASLAN2015Diagnostic). However, no significant association has been found between GPC6 expression and clinicopathological parameters, indicating that while GPC6 may play a role in cancer development, it may not be involved in cancer progression (DINCCELIKASLAN2015Diagnostic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the GPC6 gene have been linked to several medical conditions. GPC6 mutations are associated with omodysplasia-1, a rare autosomal recessive skeletal dysplasia characterized by short-limbed dwarfism and craniofacial dysmorphism (Kemp2017Identification). In the context of osteoporosis, GPC6 has been implicated in bone mineral density regulation. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in GPC6, rs1933784, is significantly associated with estimated bone mineral density (eBMD) and shows some evidence of association with GPC6 expression in osteoblasts (Kemp2017Identification).

GPC6 is also involved in congenital heart defects, particularly Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). GPC6 deficiency in mice leads to severe cardiac malformations, including double outlet right ventricle and ventricular septal defects, which are related to TOF in humans. These defects are dose-dependent, with varying severity based on the level of GPC6 transcript reduction (Tenin2021Glypican6). Additionally, increased expression of GPC6 has been observed in gastric adenocarcinoma tissues, suggesting a role in cancer development, although no significant association with clinicopathological parameters was found (DINCCELIKASLAN2015Diagnostic).

## Interactions
Glypican 6 (GPC6) is involved in various interactions that influence cellular processes. It plays a role in the Wnt/β-catenin and JAK/STAT3 signaling pathways, which are crucial for synaptic formation and nerve regeneration. GPC6 interacts with signal receptors and morphogenetic factors through its sugar chains, facilitating axonal regeneration and synaptic formation (Chen2021Running). 

In the context of TDP-43 proteinopathy, GPC6, also known as the glypican dally-like protein (Dlp) in Drosophila, interacts with the Wg/Wnt signaling pathway through the Frizzled 2 (Fz2) receptor. This interaction suggests that GPC6 acts as a co-factor and competitive inhibitor in the pathway, which is significant in neurodegenerative diseases like ALS (Lehmkuhl2021TDP43). 

GPC6 is also implicated in cellular morphology, where it may affect nuclear localization by influencing mitosis and cell cycle dynamics. This role is linked to its interactions with cell surface receptors, impacting cell growth and division (Tegtmeyer2023Highdimensional). These interactions highlight GPC6's involvement in critical signaling pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target in various conditions.
