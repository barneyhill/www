# NGDN

## Overview
Neuroguidin (NGDN) is a gene that encodes the protein neuroguidin, which is involved in critical cellular processes such as ribosome biogenesis and translational regulation. Neuroguidin is a translational regulatory protein that interacts with key components of the translation machinery, including eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), and is implicated in the regulation of protein synthesis in neurons. It is a component of the AATF-NGDN-NOL10 (ANN) complex, essential for the synthesis of the 40S ribosomal subunit, and plays a significant role in the maturation of 18S rRNA. The protein's function extends to neural development and synaptic plasticity, highlighting its importance in learning and memory processes (Bammert2016Human; Jung2006Translational). Mutations in the NGDN gene have been associated with various clinical conditions, including growth hormone-secreting pituitary adenomas and synovial sarcoma, underscoring its potential role in tumorigenesis and neurological disorders (Ku2021Novel; Qi2015Identification).

## Function
Neuroguidin (NGDN) is a protein that plays a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis and translational regulation in human cells. It is a component of the AATF-NGDN-NOL10 (ANN) complex, which is essential for the synthesis of the 40S ribosomal subunit. This complex is involved in the nucleolar steps of ribosome biogenesis, particularly in the maturation of 18S rRNA and the processing of pre-rRNA at specific cleavage sites (Bammert2016Human). NGDN's interaction with AATF and NOL10 is critical for the stability and function of the ANN complex, and its depletion leads to defects in 40S subunit biogenesis (Bammert2016Human).

In addition to its role in ribosome synthesis, NGDN functions as a translational regulatory protein by interacting with eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein (CPEB). This interaction suggests that NGDN acts as a negative regulator of translation, influencing protein synthesis in neurons and playing a role in neural development and synaptic plasticity (Jung2006Translational). NGDN is active in the cytoplasm and is involved in processes critical for learning and memory (Jung2006Translational).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the NGDN (neuroguidin) gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions. In the context of growth hormone (GH)-secreting pituitary adenomas, specific somatic variants of NGDN, such as p.S79C and p.R100H, have been associated with increased GH secretion and cell proliferation. These findings suggest that NGDN variants may contribute to the pathophysiology of GH-secreting pituitary tumors, potentially influencing tumor growth and biochemical activity (Ku2021Novel).

In synovial sarcoma, NGDN was identified as one of the genes with significant mutations, although it had not been previously linked to cancer. The study suggests that NGDN may play a role in pathways related to the inflammatory response and cellular interactions, which could be relevant to tumorigenesis in synovial sarcomas (Qi2015Identification).

Additionally, alterations in NGDN expression have been observed in neurological contexts. In zebrafish, the downregulation of NGDN was linked to changes in neuronal activity and behavior, indicating its potential involvement in neurological abnormalities due to its role in calcium homeostasis and synaptic plasticity (Wasilewska2020stim2b).

## Interactions
Neuroguidin (NGDN) is involved in several protein interactions that play crucial roles in translational control and ribosome biogenesis. NGDN interacts with the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), a cap-binding protein essential for translation initiation. This interaction is mediated by conserved motifs in NGDN that resemble those found in other eIF4E-binding proteins, such as Maskin and 4EBP1. NGDN can bind to eIF4E, potentially influencing translation by competing with eIF4G for eIF4E binding (Jung2006Translational).

In the context of ribosome biogenesis, NGDN forms a nucleolar protein complex with AATF and NOL10, known as the ANN complex. This complex is essential for the synthesis of the 40S ribosomal subunit. NGDN directly binds to AATF through its N-terminal UTP3/SAS10 domain, and this interaction is crucial for the stability and function of the complex. The ANN complex supports pre-rRNA processing and the maturation of 18S rRNA, which is vital for 40S subunit synthesis (Bammert2016Human).

These interactions highlight NGDN's role in both translational regulation and ribosome assembly, underscoring its importance in cellular processes.
