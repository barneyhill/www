# ARHGAP8

## Overview
ARHGAP8 is a gene that encodes the protein Rho GTPase activating protein 8, which is a member of the Rho GTPase-activating protein (GAP) family. This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of Rho family GTPases, including RHO, RAC, and CDC42, which are critical for various cellular processes such as cytoskeletal organization, cell cycle progression, and cell migration. The ARHGAP8 protein is characterized by its C-terminal RHOGAP domain, central SH3-binding motif, and N-terminal BNIP-2/CDC42GAP homology (BCH)/Sec14p-like domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its function in inactivating GTPases (Johnstone2004ARHGAP8). In neuronal cells, ARHGAP8 is involved in synaptic structure and function, particularly influencing actin dynamics within dendritic spines, which is essential for synaptic integrity and plasticity (Schmidt2024Neuronal). The gene's expression is developmentally regulated, with significant activity in the brain, and its dysregulation has been linked to various neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric, and oncological conditions (Schmidt2024Neuronal; Yang2021Transcriptomic).

## Structure
The ARHGAP8 protein is a member of the Rho GTPase-activating protein (GAP) family and shares significant homology with ARHGAP1. It contains three major domains: a C-terminal RHOGAP domain, a central SH3-binding motif, and an N-terminal BNIP-2/CDC42GAP homology (BCH)/Sec14p-like domain (Johnstone2004ARHGAP8). The RHOGAP domain is crucial for binding to GTP-bound RHO proteins and stimulating their GTPase activity, which is essential for down-regulating active RHO GTPases (Johnstone2004ARHGAP8).

The BCH/Sec14p-like domain is involved in protein-protein interactions and may form lipid-binding interfaces, although this function in mammalian proteins is not confirmed (Johnstone2004ARHGAP8). The protein also contains a putative SH3-binding motif (PPRPPLP), suggesting potential interactions with SRC-family tyrosine kinases and PI3K (Johnstone2004ARHGAP8).

Alternative splicing of exon 5 in ARHGAP8 results in different protein isoforms, affecting the size of the BCH/Sec14p-like domain (Johnstone2004ARHGAP8). A specific splicing event, delta-(D) exon 5, involves the deletion of the final 15 base pairs of exon 5, removing 5 amino acids from the BCH/Sec14p-like domain (Johnstone2004ARHGAP8). The human and mouse ARHGAP8 proteins share 80% amino acid sequence identity overall (Johnstone2004ARHGAP8).

## Function
ARHGAP8 is a Rho GTPase activating protein that plays a crucial role in regulating the activity of Rho family GTPases, including RHO, RAC, and CDC42. These GTPases are involved in various cellular processes such as cytoskeletal organization, cell cycle progression, and cell migration. ARHGAP8 functions by inactivating these GTPases, converting them from an active GTP-bound state to an inactive GDP-bound state, which is essential for maintaining proper cellular functions and preventing aberrant cell behaviors (Johnstone2004ARHGAP8).

In neuronal cells, ARHGAP8 is involved in controlling synapse structure and AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission. It is associated with excitatory synapses and is linked to the NMDA receptor subunit GluN2B, which is important for synaptic development. ARHGAP8 influences synaptic morphology and function by regulating actin dynamics within dendritic spines, affecting spine density, length, and volume. This regulation is crucial for maintaining synaptic integrity and function, which are essential for neuronal communication and plasticity (Schmidt2024Neuronal).

ARHGAP8 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it modulates signaling pathways critical for cellular homeostasis. Its expression is developmentally regulated, with high levels found in the brain, particularly in the cortex and hippocampus (Schmidt2024Neuronal).

## Clinical Significance
ARHGAP8 has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in regulating Rho GTPase activity. In the context of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, alterations in ARHGAP8 expression can lead to significant changes in neuronal morphology and synaptic function. Overexpression of ARHGAP8 in neurons results in reduced dendritic complexity and spine volume, as well as decreased AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission, which are associated with conditions such as major depressive disorder and Phelan-McDermid Syndrome (Schmidt2024Neuronal).

In cancer, ARHGAP8 is linked to tumor progression and prognosis. In bladder cancer, higher expression levels of ARHGAP8 correlate with poor recurrence-free and overall survival, suggesting its role in tumor-promoting immune infiltration (Yang2021Transcriptomic). In colorectal and breast cancers, ARHGAP8 is often overexpressed, although no tumor-specific somatic mutations have been identified. This overexpression may contribute to cancer development through its interactions with RHO family GTPases (Johnstone2004ARHGAP8). The gene's involvement in these conditions highlights its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in both neurological and oncological diseases.

## Interactions
ARHGAP8, a member of the RhoGAP family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It contains a BNIP-2/CDC42GAP homology (BCH)/Sec14p-like domain, which is known for mediating protein-protein interactions. This domain is involved in the homodimerization of ARHGAP1 and BNIP-2, suggesting similar interactions for ARHGAP8 (Johnstone2004ARHGAP8). ARHGAP8 also has a putative SH3-binding motif, which is identical in human and mouse ARHGAP8 and ARHGAP1 proteins. This motif is similar to those found in PI3K regulatory subunits and SHIP-1, indicating potential interactions with SH3 domains of proteins like c-SRC and p85a, linking SRC-family tyrosine kinases and PI3K signaling to RHO GTPase activation (Johnstone2004ARHGAP8).

In neuronal contexts, ARHGAP8 interacts with several proteins, including cortactin, which is involved in spine morphogenesis, and PIN1, which affects PSD95's ability to form complexes with NMDARs. It also interacts with Endophilin A2, impacting EGF receptor endocytosis and AMPAR surface recycling (Schmidt2024Neuronal). These interactions suggest that ARHGAP8 plays a role in synaptic composition and function through its binding partners, influencing synaptic plasticity and potentially contributing to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders (Schmidt2024Neuronal).
