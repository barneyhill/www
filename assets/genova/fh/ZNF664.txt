# ZNF664

## Overview
ZNF664 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 664, a member of the zinc finger protein family known for their role in binding to DNA, RNA, or other proteins. Zinc finger protein 664 is characterized by the presence of zinc finger domains, which are essential for its function in transcriptional regulation and other cellular processes. These domains enable the protein to interact with nucleic acids and other proteins, facilitating its involvement in various biological functions. The protein's activity and interactions can be modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation or ubiquitination, which may influence its structural conformation and functional capabilities. Additionally, ZNF664 can produce multiple isoforms through alternative splicing, potentially leading to diverse roles within the cell and contributing to its functional versatility (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Structure
ZNF664 encodes the zinc finger protein 664, which is characterized by the presence of zinc finger domains. These domains are crucial for the protein's ability to bind to DNA, RNA, or other proteins. Zinc finger proteins, including ZNF664, typically have a conserved structure that includes a series of zinc finger motifs. These motifs contribute to the protein's secondary and tertiary structures, allowing it to perform its biological functions effectively.

The zinc finger domains in ZNF664 are integral to its molecular structure, facilitating interactions with nucleic acids and other proteins. This interaction capability is a hallmark of zinc finger proteins, which often play roles in transcriptional regulation and other cellular processes. The structure of ZNF664 may be influenced by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation or ubiquitination, which can alter its function and interactions.

Splice variants of ZNF664 can lead to different isoforms, potentially resulting in diverse functional roles within the cell. These isoforms may exhibit variations in their zinc finger motifs, affecting their binding properties and functional outcomes. The presence of these splice variants underscores the complexity and versatility of ZNF664 in cellular processes.
