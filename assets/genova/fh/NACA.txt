# NACA

## Overview
The NACA gene encodes the nascent polypeptide-associated complex subunit alpha, a crucial component of the nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC). This protein plays a significant role in protein synthesis by associating with ribosomes to prevent premature folding of nascent polypeptides. As a transcriptional coactivator, NACA enhances the activity of transcription factors such as AP-1, influencing various cellular processes including differentiation and stress responses. Structurally, NACA is characterized by a NAC domain essential for dimerization and a ubiquitin-associated domain, although the latter is not always visible in crystallographic studies. The protein is involved in multiple interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, contributing to its regulatory functions in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. NACA's involvement in cellular differentiation, particularly in erythroid and osteoblast lineages, underscores its importance in development and disease (Moreau1998BoneSpecific; Liu2010The; Lopez2005NACA).

## Structure
The NACA protein, a subunit of the nascent polypeptide-associated complex, is characterized by its distinct structural features. The primary structure of NACA includes a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains, such as the NAC domain, which is crucial for dimerization with the β-NAC subunit (Liu2010The; Wang2010Crystal). The secondary structure of NACA consists of six β-strands that contribute to a β-barrel formation, a common structural motif in proteins (Liu2010The; Wang2010Crystal).

In terms of tertiary structure, NACA forms a compact β-barrel with a V-shaped topology, stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds (Wang2010Crystal). The quaternary structure involves the formation of a heterodimer with the β-NAC subunit, which is more stable than the NACA homodimer due to electrostatic interactions (Wang2010Crystal).

NACA also contains a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain at its C-terminal end, although this domain was not observed in the crystal structure due to crystallization conditions (Liu2010The; Wang2010Crystal). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination, which regulate its stability and function (Liu2010The). Additionally, NACA has splice variant isoforms, including skNAC, a muscle-specific isoform involved in myofibril organization (Li2009skNAC).

## Function
The NACA gene encodes the alpha chain of the nascent-polypeptide-associated complex, which plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by associating with ribosomes to prevent premature folding of nascent polypeptides. In healthy human cells, NACA functions as a transcriptional coactivator, enhancing the activity of the AP-1 transcription factor, particularly through its interaction with the c-Jun homodimer. This interaction stabilizes the AP-1 complex on its DNA recognition sequence, significantly reducing the dissociation constant and enhancing transcriptional activation (Moreau1998BoneSpecific; Yotov1998The).

NACA is involved in the regulation of erythroid-cell differentiation, acting as a positive regulator by maintaining its expression during erythroid differentiation and promoting erythropoietin-independent differentiation in certain cell lines (Lopez2005NACA). It is also implicated in osteoblast differentiation, where its activity is modulated by phosphorylation, affecting its nuclear localization and interaction with other proteins (Addison2019Dephosphorylation).

NACA's role extends to cellular stress responses and transcriptional regulation, with its activity being crucial for processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. It is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing cell differentiation and development (Addison2019Dephosphorylation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the NACA gene have been implicated in various conditions, particularly those affecting bone formation and response to hormonal treatments. Disruptions in NACA's phosphorylation status can impact bone formation and mass, as evidenced by studies on knock-in mice with altered NACA phosphorylation sites. These disruptions suggest that NACA plays a critical role in osteoblast differentiation and activity, which are essential for bone health (Addison2019Dephosphorylation).

NACA is also involved in the anabolic response to intermittent parathyroid hormone (iPTH) treatment, which is crucial for bone mass regulation. Studies have shown that NACA, along with LRP6, forms part of a genetic pathway necessary for the full anabolic response to iPTH. In compound heterozygous animals with mutations in both Naca and Lrp6, the anabolic response to iPTH is significantly blunted, indicating that these genes are essential for maintaining bone mass homeostasis (StArnaud2022NACA).

Additionally, NACA's role in protein synthesis regulation, particularly in the translation of proteins with gly-ala repeat (GAr) domains, suggests its involvement in controlling the expression of certain viral proteins, although specific diseases related to this function have not been directly identified (Zheng2022The).

## Interactions
NACA, the nascent polypeptide-associated complex subunit alpha, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It forms a heterodimeric complex with BTF3, a general transcription factor, which is involved in TATA-box mediated transcription (Addison2019Dephosphorylation). NACA interacts with the Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) and its GAr peptide domain, primarily within the nuclear compartment, affecting mRNA translation of GAr-carrying mRNAs in cis (Zheng2022The). 

NACA also binds to nucleic acids, including double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), and single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), with a higher affinity for ssRNA. This binding is mediated by a positively charged inner surface of the NACA homodimer (Liu2010The). The protein is involved in the recruitment of nucleolin to GAr-encoding mRNA, which forms G-quadruplex structures, facilitating the interaction between nucleolin and the mRNA (Zheng2022The).

NACA's interactions extend to the ribosome, where it binds to ribosomal proteins and nascent chains, playing a role similar to that of the bacterial ribosome-associated chaperone TF (Wegrzyn2006A). These interactions highlight NACA's multifaceted role in protein synthesis and gene regulation.
