# FTH1

## Overview
The FTH1 gene encodes the ferritin heavy chain 1, a crucial component of the ferritin protein complex involved in iron storage and regulation within cells. Ferritin heavy chain 1 is categorized as an iron-binding protein, playing a pivotal role in maintaining iron homeostasis by converting ferrous iron (Fe(II)) to ferric iron (Fe(III)), which is then sequestered within the ferritin complex. This conversion is essential for preventing iron-mediated oxidative stress and supporting vital cellular functions. The protein is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, where it mitigates oxidative damage by reducing the formation of reactive oxygen species. FTH1 is also implicated in various cellular processes, including the regulation of pluripotency in embryonic stem cells and the modulation of proline metabolism in cancer cells. Its clinical significance is underscored by its involvement in diseases such as acute myeloid leukemia, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, Parkinson's disease, and hereditary ferritinopathy, where alterations in FTH1 expression or function can have profound pathological consequences (Muhoberac2019Iron; Scaramuzzino2021Uncovering; Zhang2023High).

## Structure
The FTH1 gene encodes the ferritin heavy chain 1, a subunit of the ferritin protein complex responsible for iron storage. The primary structure of FTH1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its higher-level structures. The secondary structure is predominantly composed of alpha helices, which are crucial for the protein's stability and function (Tiwari2019Structural; Muhoberac2019Iron).

The tertiary structure of FTH1 involves the folding of these alpha helices into a compact, functional form. This structure is characterized by a ferroxidase center, which is essential for the oxidation of ferrous ions, a key step in iron mineralization (Muhoberac2019Iron). The quaternary structure of ferritin involves the assembly of 24 subunits, including both heavy and light chains, into a hollow spherical shell. This structure allows the storage of up to 4,500 iron atoms within its core (Muhoberac2019Iron).

FTH1 does not have specific domains or prominent folds mentioned in the context, nor are there details on common post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms provided. The protein's role in iron metabolism is critical, with its structure facilitating efficient iron uptake and storage (Muhoberac2019Iron).

## Function
The FTH1 gene encodes the ferritin heavy chain, a critical component of the ferritin protein complex responsible for iron storage and regulation in cells. In healthy human cells, FTH1 plays a vital role in maintaining iron homeostasis by converting ferrous iron (Fe(II)) to the less reactive ferric iron (Fe(III)), which is then safely stored within the ferritin complex. This conversion is crucial for preventing iron-mediated oxidative stress and supporting essential cellular functions such as DNA synthesis and oxygen transport (Scaramuzzino2021Uncovering).

FTH1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it sequesters excess labile iron, thereby reducing the formation of oxygen-derived free radicals and protecting cells from oxidative damage (Scaramuzzino2021Uncovering). The protein also contributes to the antioxidant defense system, which includes enzymes like superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, as well as non-enzymatic molecules like ascorbic acid (Scaramuzzino2021Uncovering).

In human embryonic stem cells, FTH1 is involved in managing oxidative stress and maintaining cellular iron homeostasis, which is essential for resisting hypoxic stress and regulating pluripotency (Scaramuzzino2021Uncovering). The gene's activity is linked to the activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway, which enhances the expression of antioxidant response genes (Scaramuzzino2021Uncovering).

## Clinical Significance
The FTH1 gene, encoding the ferritin heavy chain 1, plays a significant role in various diseases due to its involvement in iron metabolism and oxidative stress response. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), particularly non-M3 AML in children, high expression levels of FTH1 are associated with poor prognosis. This overexpression is linked to increased leukemic cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis, potentially through the ferroptosis pathway (Zhang2023High; Bertoli2018Ferritin).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), FTH1 expression is upregulated in KRAS-mutant cells, contributing to cancer progression through interactions with PYCR1, which affects proline metabolism. This upregulation is associated with poorer survival outcomes, suggesting FTH1 as a potential therapeutic target (Park2024Crosstalk).

In Parkinson's disease (PD), FTH1 is involved in regulating ferroptosis, an iron-dependent cell death process. Alterations in FTH1 expression affect cell viability and mitochondrial function, indicating its role in the pathogenesis of PD through ferroptosis and ferritinophagy (Tian2020FTH1).

Hereditary ferritinopathy, a neurodegenerative disease, is linked to mutations in FTH1, leading to iron accumulation, oxidative stress, and protein aggregation, contributing to cellular dysfunction and death (Muhoberac2019Iron).

## Interactions
FTH1, or ferritin heavy chain 1, is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for its function in iron metabolism and cellular processes. In human somatic cells, FTH1 mRNA is regulated by piR-FTH1, a piRNA that interacts with HIWI family proteins, particularly HIWI2 and HILI. These interactions are essential for the formation of a piRNA-induced silencing complex (piRISC), which regulates FTH1 mRNA expression (Balaratnam2018A).

In bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, FTH1 interacts with NSUN5, an RNA methyltransferase, which binds to FTH1 mRNA and modifies it through 5-methylcytosine (5mC) RNA modification. This interaction is facilitated by the recruitment of TRAP1, a mitochondrial paralog of heat-shock protein 90, which further modifies FTH1 (Liu2022The).

FTH1 also interacts with iron regulatory protein-1 (IRP-1) through an iron-responsive element (IRE) in its mRNA. This interaction is crucial for maintaining intracellular iron homeostasis by regulating the translation of ferritin in response to iron levels (Connell2018Evaluation).

In pancreatic cancer cells, FTH1 interacts with pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1 (PYCR1) to regulate proline metabolism, which is important for cancer cell viability and growth (Park2024Crosstalk).
