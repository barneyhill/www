# ST6GALNAC1

## Overview
ST6GALNAC1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme ST6 N-acetylgalactosaminide alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase 1, which is a type of glycosyltransferase. This enzyme is primarily involved in the sialylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids, a process that adds sialic acid to N-acetylgalactosamine residues, thereby modifying glycan structures. These modifications are crucial for various cellular processes, including cell-cell interactions, signaling, and the stability of glycoproteins (Li2018Sialylation). The enzyme operates within the Golgi apparatus, contributing to the synthesis of sialylated glycans that influence cellular communication and immune responses (Nguyen2022Tumor). ST6GALNAC1's activity is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and facilitating normal physiological processes, highlighting its fundamental role in glycosylation (Ahmad2024Differential).

## Structure


## Function
ST6GALNAC1 encodes an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the sialylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids, specifically adding sialic acid to N-acetylgalactosamine residues. This enzymatic activity is significant in the modification of glycan structures, which are essential for various cellular processes, including cell-cell interactions, signaling, and the stability of glycoproteins (Li2018Sialylation). The enzyme is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it participates in the synthesis of sialylated glycans, impacting cellular communication and immune responses (Nguyen2022Tumor).

In healthy human cells, ST6GALNAC1 is involved in the production of sialylated antigens, which are important for normal cellular functions and interactions. The enzyme's activity contributes to the maintenance of cell adhesion and signaling pathways, which are vital for tissue integrity and function (Li2018Sialylation). Although the specific roles of ST6GALNAC1 in healthy cells are not extensively detailed, its involvement in glycosylation processes suggests a fundamental role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and facilitating normal physiological processes (Ahmad2024Differential). The enzyme's function in healthy cells is implied through its interactions with other proteins and its role in glycan synthesis (Ahmad2024Differential).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ST6GALNAC1 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), and prostate cancer (PCa). In CRC, ST6GALNAC1 is associated with the upregulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and MYC targets, suggesting its role as a potential oncogene. Its expression is linked to IL-6-mediated JAK/STAT3 signaling, which promotes EMT and may facilitate tumor microenvironment heterogeneity and metastasis (Ahmad2024Differential). The gene's expression is significantly downregulated in CRC tumors compared to normal tissues, correlating with poor survival outcomes (Ahmad2024Differential).

In contrast, ST6GALNAC1 is downregulated in ESCC, where it may function as a tumor suppressor. This downregulation is associated with frequent loss of heterozygosity and hypermethylation, suggesting that these mechanisms contribute to its reduced expression in ESCC (Iwaya2016Downregulation). 

In PCa, ST6GALNAC1 is upregulated in primary tumors and is regulated by the androgen receptor, playing a role in the synthesis of the cancer-associated sialyl-Tn antigen, which is linked to metastasis and poor prognosis (Munkley2015The). The gene's expression decreases in metastatic prostate cancer cells, indicating a complex role in cancer progression (Munkley2015The).
