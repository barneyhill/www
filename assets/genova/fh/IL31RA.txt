# IL31RA

## Overview
The IL31RA gene encodes the interleukin 31 receptor A, a type I cytokine receptor that plays a crucial role in the immune system by mediating the effects of the cytokine interleukin-31 (IL-31). This receptor is a part of the gp130/IL-6 receptor family and is characterized by its extracellular domain, which includes five fibronectin type III domains essential for cytokine binding (Hermanns2015Oncostatin). Unlike other members of its family, IL31RA does not utilize gp130 as a receptor subunit but instead forms a heterodimeric complex with the oncostatin M receptor beta (OSMRβ) to facilitate IL-31 signaling (Lin2009Novel). The IL31RA protein is involved in several signaling pathways, including JAK/STAT, Akt/PI3K, and MAPK, which are integral to inflammatory and allergic responses, as well as neuroimmune communication (Datsi2021Interleukin‐31:). Its expression is predominantly found in epithelial and neuronal cells, where it contributes to processes such as itch transmission and neurogenic inflammation (Datsi2021Interleukin‐31:). Alterations in the IL31RA gene have been linked to various dermatological and inflammatory conditions, highlighting its clinical significance (Roh2021IL31; Lin2009Novel).

## Structure
The IL31RA protein is a type I cytokine receptor that is part of the gp130/IL-6 receptor family. It features an extracellular domain composed of five fibronectin type III domains (D1-D5), with D1 and D2 forming the cytokine binding module. This module includes conserved cysteines and the WSXWS motif, which are crucial for its function (Hermanns2015Oncostatin). Unlike other IL-6-type cytokines, IL31RA does not utilize gp130 as a receptor subunit but binds with low affinity to IL-31 (Hermanns2015Oncostatin).

The intracellular region of the long isoform of IL31RA contains a conserved box1 region, which is important for Janus kinase recruitment, particularly Jak1, which is more crucial for IL-31 signal transduction than Jak2 (Hermanns2015Oncostatin). The IL31RA protein can form a heterodimeric receptor complex with the oncostatin M receptor beta (OSMRb) to mediate IL-31 signaling (Lin2009Novel).

IL31RA is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in several splice variants, although their physiological relevance remains unclear. The main signal transducing isoforms contain 192 intracellular amino acids (Hermanns2015Oncostatin). The protein can undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which is common in cytokine receptors (Hermanns2015Oncostatin).

## Function
The IL31RA gene encodes the interleukin 31 receptor A, which is a component of a heterodimeric receptor complex with the Oncostatin M receptor β (OSMRβ). This receptor complex is primarily involved in the signaling pathways of the cytokine interleukin-31 (IL-31), which plays a significant role in inflammatory and allergic responses. In healthy human cells, IL31RA is expressed predominantly in epithelial and neuronal cell types, including dorsal root ganglia neurons and keratinocytes (Datsi2021Interleukin‐31:).

IL31RA is involved in several signaling pathways, such as the JAK/STAT, Akt/PI3K, and MAPK-JNK/p38 pathways, which are crucial for mediating inflammatory responses, immune defense, and neuroimmune communication. The receptor's activation by IL-31 can stimulate itch and neuronal outgrowth, linking immune cells to the epithelium and the neuronal network (Datsi2021Interleukin‐31:). In the nervous system, IL31RA is involved in the transmission of itch signals, contributing to neurogenic inflammation and normal sensory nerve function (Datsi2021Interleukin‐31:).

The physiological function of IL31RA in healthy human cells is not fully understood, but it is implicated in tissue homeostasis and immune defense, suggesting a role in maintaining normal sensory nerve function and immune system interactions (Datsi2021Interleukin‐31:).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IL31RA gene are associated with several dermatological and inflammatory conditions. In familial primary cutaneous amyloidosis (FPCA), a specific mutation, p.S521F, in the IL31RA gene has been identified. This mutation is found in affected individuals but not in unaffected individuals or other primary cutaneous amyloidosis (PCA) patients, suggesting a direct link to the disease. The mutation occurs at a conserved codon position, indicating its potential significance in the pathogenesis of FPCA (Lin2009Novel).

In atopic dermatitis (AD), increased expression of IL31RA is observed in epidermal keratinocytes, correlating with disease severity. This overexpression is linked to heightened sensitivity to IL-31, contributing to pruritus and impaired skin barrier function. Genetic studies have also identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the IL31RA gene associated with intrinsic AD (Fania2022Multiple; Roh2021IL31).

IL31RA is also implicated in prurigo nodularis (PN) and autoimmune diseases like bullous pemphigoid and dermatomyositis, where its expression correlates with itch severity. These findings suggest that changes in IL31RA expression or mutations may contribute to the pathogenesis and symptomatology of these conditions (Roh2021IL31).

## Interactions
IL31RA, as part of the interleukin-31 receptor complex, interacts with the oncostatin M receptor beta (OSMRβ) to form a functional heterodimeric receptor necessary for IL-31 signaling. This interaction is crucial for the activation of downstream signaling pathways, including JAK/STAT, PI3K/AKT, and MAPK pathways (Di2018IL33IL31; Zhang2008Structures). IL31RA predominantly binds IL-31 through its cytokine-binding domain, while OSMR enhances this binding when coupled with IL31RA (Zhang2008Structures).

The cytoplasmic domain of IL31RA contains specific tyrosine residues, such as Tyr-652 and Tyr-721, which are important for recruiting signal transducers like STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5. These interactions are essential for the receptor's ability to mediate cellular responses to IL-31, including changes in cell morphology and suppression of proliferation (Chattopadhyay2007Interleukin31). The Y721F mutation in IL31RA significantly attenuates STAT3 signaling, highlighting the importance of this residue in the receptor's interaction with STAT3 (Chattopadhyay2007Interleukin31).

IL31RA does not directly interact with nucleic acids, but its role in cytokine signaling involves interactions with various proteins, including those in the Jak family and other downstream signaling molecules (Zhang2008Structures).
