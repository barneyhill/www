# ZNF488

## Overview
ZNF488 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 488, a member of the C2H2-type zinc finger protein family. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger domains, which facilitate DNA binding and are crucial for its role in regulating gene expression. Zinc finger protein 488 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, proliferation, and survival, through its interactions with key signaling pathways. It has been implicated in the progression of several cancers, such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer, where it acts as an oncogene by promoting tumorigenesis and metastasis. The protein's ability to modulate pathways like the collagen IV/FAK/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways underscores its significance in cancer biology (ZNF488; p&gt; Xiao2023Overexpression; Zong2019&lt; Zhang2021ZNF488).

## Structure
ZNF488 is a zinc finger protein characterized by the presence of C2H2-type zinc finger domains, which are crucial for its DNA-binding capability. The primary structure of ZNF488 is rich in cysteine and histidine residues, which are essential for the coordination of zinc ions, a key feature that stabilizes the protein's tertiary structure. The secondary structure of ZNF488 likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, common in zinc finger proteins, facilitating the formation of the finger-like projections that interact with DNA.

The tertiary structure of ZNF488 is stabilized by the coordination of zinc ions, which is a hallmark of zinc finger proteins. This coordination is critical for maintaining the structural integrity necessary for DNA binding. ZNF488 may also undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions.

Splice variants of ZNF488 may exist, potentially altering its functional domains and affecting its role in cellular processes. These variants can lead to differences in the protein's structure and function, although specific details on the variants of ZNF488 are not provided in the available context.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZNF488 has been implicated in several cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), ZNF488 acts as an oncogene, promoting cell adhesion, proliferation, invasion, and tumorigenesis. It enhances these processes through the collagen IV/FAK/AKT/cyclin D1 pathway and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). High expression of ZNF488 in NPC is associated with poorer overall survival and increased locoregional failure and distant metastasis, making it an independent prognostic indicator (ZNF488; p&gt; Zong2016ZNF488; Zong2019&lt).

In pancreatic cancer, ZNF488 overexpression supports cell proliferation and tumorigenesis by inhibiting ferroptosis through the regulation of SCD1-mediated unsaturated fatty acid metabolism. This overexpression confers resistance to ferroptosis inducers and chemotherapeutic drugs like gemcitabine, suggesting that ZNF488 is a poor prognostic factor in pancreatic cancer (Xiao2023Overexpression).

ZNF488 is also involved in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where it enhances invasion and metastasis by activating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. This activation leads to EMT, further promoting cancer progression (Zhang2021ZNF488).

## Interactions
ZNF488, a zinc finger protein, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence cellular processes. In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), ZNF488 interacts with the collagen IV/FAK/AKT pathway, enhancing cell adhesion and proliferation. This interaction involves the phosphorylation of FAK and AKT, which are crucial for cell cycle progression and survival (ZNF488; p&gt; Zong2019&lt). ZNF488 also upregulates cyclin D1 expression, promoting cell cycle progression without affecting cyclin D2 and cyclin E levels (ZNF488; p&gt; Zong2019&lt).

In pancreatic cancer, ZNF488 interacts with the promoter sequence of the SCD1 gene, enhancing its transcriptional activity. This interaction supports cancer cell proliferation by inhibiting ferroptosis, a form of cell death associated with lipid peroxidation (Xiao2023Overexpression). The regulation of SCD1 by ZNF488 is significant in modulating unsaturated fatty acid metabolism, which is crucial for tumorigenesis (Xiao2023Overexpression).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ZNF488 is involved in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis. It increases the expression of phosphorylated ERK1/2, MMP2, and MMP9, which are associated with enhanced invasion and metastasis (Zhang2021ZNF488).
