# C1orf198

## Overview
C1orf198, or chromosome 1 open reading frame 198, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is currently categorized as an uncharacterized protein due to limited functional information. The protein has been implicated in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of cancer, where it interacts with proteins such as ARHGEF1 and PPP2R1A, suggesting a potential role in modulating phosphorylation and GTPase activity (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Although the precise biological functions of C1orf198 remain to be fully elucidated, its involvement in protein-protein interactions and its association with disease states like gastric cancer and venous thromboembolism indicate its potential significance in cellular signaling and disease pathogenesis (Wang2017Identification; Zöller2019Genetics). Further research is necessary to clarify the functional roles and clinical implications of C1orf198.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
C1orf198 has been implicated in several diseases through alterations in its expression and interactions. In gastric cancer, C1orf198 is part of a 9-gene expression signature that helps classify patients into high- and low-risk groups, indicating its potential role in prognosis prediction (Wang2017Identification). Although its specific function in gastric cancer is not well understood, its inclusion in this prognostic model suggests clinical significance.

In the context of venous thromboembolism (VTE), C1orf198 was identified as one of the genetic loci associated with the condition in a large genome-wide association study. This study highlights the gene's potential involvement in coagulation and inflammation pathways, which are critical in VTE pathogenesis (Zöller2019Genetics).

C1orf198 has also been noted for its disrupted interactions in cancerous tissues, particularly with proteins like PPP2R1A and ARHGEF1. These interactions, which differ from those in normal tissues, suggest a role in cancer-dependent protein-protein interactions, potentially affecting cancer progression (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

Despite these associations, the specific clinical implications of C1orf198 mutations or expression changes remain under investigation, and further research is needed to fully elucidate its role in disease pathways.

## Interactions
C1orf198, also known as chromosome 1 open reading frame 198, is a protein that has been studied for its interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of cancer. It has been identified to interact with ARHGEF1, a GTPase-activating protein, and PPP2R1A, which is involved in phosphorylation processes. These interactions exhibit negative or near-zero correlation coefficients in cancerous tissues, while showing positive coefficients in normal tissues, suggesting that these protein-protein interactions may be disrupted in cancer (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

Despite these findings, other studies have not identified direct interactions of C1orf198 with proteins in certain experimental setups. For instance, in a study involving a ZIP8 knockout cell model, C1orf198 did not show direct interactions with any of the analyzed proteins in the protein-protein interaction network (Tan2022Singlegene). Additionally, there is no current evidence of C1orf198 interacting with nucleic acids, as the available studies have not provided specific information on such interactions (Tan2022Singlegene; Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Further research is needed to fully elucidate the interaction profile of C1orf198 and its potential roles in cellular processes.
