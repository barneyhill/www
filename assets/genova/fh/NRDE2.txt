# NRDE2

## Overview
The NRDE2 gene encodes the NRDE-2 protein, a crucial component in RNA processing and gene silencing mechanisms within human cells. The NRDE-2 protein is characterized by its involvement in RNA interference and is categorized as an RNA processing factor due to its structural domains, including a conserved NRDE-2 domain and a nuclear localization sequence. It plays a significant role in RNA splicing, particularly in suppressing intron retention in pre-mRNAs, and is essential for maintaining genomic stability by preventing DNA damage accumulation during mitosis. The protein interacts with the RNA helicase MTR4, forming a complex that regulates RNA biogenesis and ensures mRNA stability and export. This interaction is vital for the competition between nuclear export and degradation machinery, highlighting NRDE-2's role as a negative regulator of the exosome. Alterations in NRDE2 expression or function have been linked to genomic instability and cancer, underscoring its importance in cellular function and disease (Wang2019NRDE2; Jiao2018Human; Asundi2018The).

## Structure
The NRDE2 protein, also known as human nuclear RNAi-defective 2, features several structural domains essential for its function in RNA processing and gene silencing. It contains a conserved NRDE-2 domain, a nuclear localization sequence, and five HAT repeats, which are motifs commonly found in RNA processing factors (Jiao2018Human). The protein also includes a coiled-coil domain known as the MTR4-interacting domain (MID), which is necessary and sufficient for its interaction with the MTR4 protein (Wang2019NRDE2). This interaction is crucial for inhibiting MTR4 recruitment and ensuring efficient mRNA nuclear export (Wang2019NRDE2).

The NRDE2 protein can form a 1:1 complex with MTR4, causing MTR4 to adopt a closed conformation, which enhances its RNA-binding and helicase activity (Wang2019NRDE2). This interaction involves specific residues on the MTR4 Arch domain and the helicase core (Wang2019NRDE2). NRDE2 also possesses a conserved AIM-like motif that competes with other proteins for MTR4 binding, suggesting a regulatory role in MTR4 recruitment (Wang2019NRDE2). The protein's structure and interactions are critical for its role in RNA splicing and genomic stability.

## Function
NRDE2 is an essential RNA splicing factor in human cells, playing a critical role in RNA processing and genomic stability. It is involved in suppressing intron retention in pre-mRNAs, particularly those with short, GC-rich introns and weak splice sites. NRDE2 interacts with components of the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein, the exon junction complex, and the RNA exosome, facilitating proper RNA splicing and processing (Jiao2018Human).

In the nucleus, NRDE2 forms a complex with the RNA helicase MTR4, which is crucial for regulating RNA biogenesis, including RNA maturation, degradation, and surveillance. This complex inhibits MTR4's recruitment to the exosome, ensuring mRNA stability and export, which is vital for the competition between nuclear export and degradation machinery (Wang2019NRDE2).

NRDE2 also plays a role in maintaining genomic stability by preventing DNA damage accumulation during mitosis, particularly under stressful conditions. It interacts with β-actin, and this interaction is disrupted upon DNA damage, suggesting a role in DNA repair processes (Asundi2018The). The loss of NRDE2 leads to increased genomic instability, DNA damage, and defects in centrosome maturation and mitotic progression, highlighting its importance in cell cycle regulation (Jiao2018Human).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the NRDE2 gene have been implicated in conditions characterized by genomic instability, such as cancer. NRDE2 plays a crucial role in preventing DNA damage accumulation during mitosis, particularly under stressful conditions like high temperatures or oncogene overexpression. In human cells, loss of NRDE2 leads to increased DNA damage and delayed mitotic phases, especially when Aurora B kinase, a regulator of mitosis, is overexpressed. This suggests that NRDE2 is important for maintaining genomic stability, and its dysfunction could contribute to cancer development (Asundi2018The).

NRDE2 is also involved in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling, processes that are essential for genomic integrity. Its interaction with β-actin, which is involved in DNA repair, is disrupted in DNA-damaged cells, indicating a potential mechanism by which NRDE2 influences DNA repair processes. This disruption may lead to increased susceptibility to DNA damage and genomic instability, further linking NRDE2 to cancer risk (Asundi2018The).

While the clinical significance of NRDE2 gene mutations is not fully understood, its role in RNA processing and genome protection suggests that alterations in NRDE2 expression or function could have significant implications for diseases associated with genomic instability (Wan2020A).

## Interactions
The NRDE2 protein in humans is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in RNA processing and gene regulation. NRDE2 interacts with the RNA helicase MTR4, forming a complex that is crucial for its function. This interaction is mediated by the MTR4-interacting domain (MID) of NRDE2, which binds to the Arch domain and helicase core of MTR4, resulting in a closed conformation that inhibits MTR4's recruitment to the exosome and other proteins (Wang2019NRDE2). NRDE2 also interacts with components of the RNA exosome, such as EXOSC10 and SKIV2L2, and the exon junction complex, including eIF4A3. These interactions suggest NRDE2's involvement in RNA splicing and stability (Jiao2018Human).

NRDE2's interaction with MTR4 is essential for maintaining mRNA stability and nuclear export by preventing MTR4 from associating with other proteins like ZCCHC8 and Nop53, which are important for RNA degradation (Wang2019NRDE2). The NRDE2-MTR4 complex is also implicated in genome protection and pre-mRNA quality control, potentially through exosome-based pre-mRNA degradation or splicing regulation (Wan2020A). These interactions highlight NRDE2's role as a negative regulator of the exosome, crucial for RNA processing and cellular function.
