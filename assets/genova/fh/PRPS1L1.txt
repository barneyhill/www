# PRPS1L1

## Overview
The PRPS1L1 gene encodes the protein phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 1 like 1, which is a member of the phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase (PRPS) family. This protein is involved in the biosynthesis of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides, playing a crucial role in cellular metabolism and nucleotide homeostasis. As a synthetase, it catalyzes the synthesis of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) from ribose-5-phosphate and ATP, a key step in the nucleotide biosynthetic pathway. The PRPS1L1 protein is particularly significant in tissues with high rates of nucleotide turnover, such as the liver and brain, where it contributes to the regulation of nucleotide pools necessary for DNA and RNA synthesis. Mutations or dysregulation of this gene may have implications in various metabolic disorders and diseases, although specific clinical associations are still under investigation.
