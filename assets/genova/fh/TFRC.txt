# TFRC

## Overview
The TFRC gene encodes the transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), a type II transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in cellular iron uptake. This receptor is essential for binding and internalizing iron-loaded transferrin, facilitating iron transport into cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. TfR1 is ubiquitously expressed on the surface of all nucleated cells, with heightened expression in rapidly dividing cells such as erythroblasts and cancer cells, reflecting their increased iron demands. The expression of TFRC is tightly regulated by cellular iron levels and involves complex interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, including transferrin and RNA. Dysregulation of TFRC can lead to significant clinical consequences, including immunodeficiency and cancer, highlighting its critical role in maintaining iron homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target (Aba2024A; Li2023TFRC–RNA; Kawabata2019Transferrin).

## Structure
The transferrin receptor (TFRC) is a transmembrane glycoprotein crucial for iron uptake in cells. Its primary structure consists of a polypeptide chain that forms a 97-kDa type 2 membrane protein, expressed as a homodimer on the cell membrane (Kawabata2019Transferrin). The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stability and function. The tertiary structure of TFRC is a folded 3D conformation that allows for specific interactions with transferrin, facilitating iron transport into cells through clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Kawabata2019Transferrin).

In terms of quaternary structure, TFRC functions as a homodimer, which is essential for its role in iron uptake. The receptor contains specific domains, such as the apical domain and helical domain, which are involved in binding transferrin and mediating endocytosis. Common post-translational modifications of TFRC include glycosylation, which is important for its stability and function on the cell surface. Splice variant isoforms of TFRC may exist, potentially affecting its function and localization within different cell types (Kawabata2019Transferrin). These structural features enable TFRC to play a vital role in maintaining iron homeostasis in the body.

## Function
The TFRC gene encodes the transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), a crucial protein for iron uptake in human cells. TfR1 is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein that facilitates the binding and internalization of iron-loaded transferrin (holo-Tf) through receptor-mediated endocytosis. This process is essential for cellular iron acquisition, which supports various metabolic functions, including DNA synthesis and energy production (Unknownauthors2017ModulationofMelanotransferrinandTransferrinReceptor1(TFRC; Kawabata2019Transferrin)andCD44basedSignalingforTFRCUpregulationinHumanMelanomaCells page 0 of 4).

In healthy human cells, TfR1 is expressed on the surface of all nucleated cells, with higher expression in rapidly proliferating cells such as erythroblasts, activated lymphocytes, and cancer cells, reflecting their increased iron requirements (Kawabata2019Transferrin; Ryschich2004Transferrin). The receptor's expression is regulated by cellular iron levels, increasing in iron-deficient states and decreasing when iron is abundant. This regulation occurs at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, involving hypoxia-inducible factors and the iron regulatory protein-iron responsive element system (Kawabata2019Transferrin).

TfR1 also interacts with ferritin, another iron storage protein, to facilitate iron uptake. The receptor's activity is vital for maintaining iron homeostasis, and its dysfunction can lead to iron deficiency and associated health issues (Kawabata2019Transferrin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TFRC gene, which encodes transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), have significant clinical implications. A novel homozygous germline mutation, specifically the c.64C > T, p.R22W variant, has been linked to combined immunodeficiency. This mutation impairs TfR1 internalization, leading to defective lymphocyte function, increased apoptosis, and impaired proliferation. These defects are associated with increased susceptibility to infections, hypogammaglobulinemia, and restricted immune repertoire diversity (Aba2024A). 

In addition to immunodeficiency, TFRC mutations can affect mitochondrial respiration and cytokine production, further compromising immune responses (Aba2024A). Overexpression of TFRC is observed in various cancers, including colorectal cancer, where it enhances tumor growth by increasing iron uptake necessary for cell proliferation (Liu2023IGF2BP2). 

Alterations in TFRC expression are also implicated in inflammatory bowel disease, where its upregulation is linked to systemic iron deficiency and intestinal inflammation, mediated by the HIF1α pathway (Fagundes2022HIF1αDependent). These findings underscore the critical role of TFRC in iron metabolism and its impact on disease pathogenesis.

## Interactions
The transferrin receptor (TFRC) is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for its function in iron homeostasis and gene regulation. TFRC interacts with transferrin, facilitating iron uptake through endocytosis (Kawabata2019Transferrin). It also forms complexes with the hemochromatosis protein (HFE), which modulates the receptor's affinity for transferrin. This interaction is disrupted by mutations such as C282Y and H63D in HFE, affecting iron regulation (Feder1998The; Lebrón1998Crystal).

TFRC is also known to bind RNA, acting as an RNA-binding protein (RBP) that regulates gene expression and alternative splicing in human renal mesangial cells. It influences the splicing of various genes, including those involved in mRNA splicing and DNA repair pathways (Li2023TFRC–RNA). The receptor's interaction with RNA is significant in conditions like IgA nephropathy, where it regulates genes associated with the disease (Li2023TFRC–RNA).

Additionally, TFRC mRNA stability is regulated by interactions with iron regulatory proteins (IRPs) and iron-responsive elements (IREs) in its 3' UTR, which protect the mRNA from degradation during iron depletion (Rupani2016Transferrin).
