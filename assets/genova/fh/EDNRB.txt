# EDNRB

## Overview
The EDNRB gene encodes the endothelin receptor type B, a member of the rhodopsin-type superfamily of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This receptor is integral to the endothelin signaling pathway, which plays a pivotal role in regulating vasodilation and vasoconstriction, as well as in various developmental processes. The endothelin receptor type B is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains, typical of GPCRs, and is involved in binding endothelin peptides such as endothelin-1, -2, and -3. Functionally, EDNRB is crucial for processes such as thermogenic differentiation of adipose tissue, nitric oxide production in endothelial cells, and neural crest cell migration and differentiation. Mutations in the EDNRB gene are linked to genetic disorders like Hirschsprung disease and Waardenburg syndrome, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Mazzuca2012Vascular; Wang2024Endothelin; Carrasquillo2002Genomewide).

## Structure
The EDNRB protein, also known as endothelin receptor type B, is a member of the rhodopsin-type superfamily of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). It consists of 442 amino acids and has a predicted molecular mass of approximately 50 kDa (Mazzuca2012Vascular). The primary structure of EDNRB includes a long extracellular N-terminus, seven helical transmembrane domains (TMDs), three extracellular loops, three intracellular loops, and a cytoplasmic C-terminus tail (Mazzuca2012Vascular). 

The secondary structure is characterized by these helical transmembrane domains, which are typical of GPCRs (Mazzuca2012Vascular). The tertiary structure involves the arrangement of these helices and loops to form the functional receptor capable of binding ligands and interacting with G-proteins (Mazzuca2012Vascular). While the quaternary structure is not explicitly detailed, GPCRs like EDNRB typically function as monomers or dimers (Mazzuca2012Vascular).

Post-translational modifications of EDNRB include palmitoylation, phosphorylation, and possibly glycosylation, which can affect its signaling and receptor function (Mazzuca2012Vascular). Several splice variants of the receptor have been identified, which differ in certain regions but generally retain similar binding characteristics to the wild-type receptor (Mazzuca2012Vascular).

## Function
The EDNRB gene encodes the endothelin receptor type B, a G protein-coupled receptor involved in various physiological processes. In healthy human cells, EDNRB plays a critical role in the endothelin signaling pathway, which is essential for vasodilation and vasoconstriction regulation. This receptor binds endothelin peptides, including endothelin-1, -2, and -3, and is primarily active in the cell membrane (Mazzuca2012Vascular; Schneider2007Contrasting).

EDNRB is involved in promoting the thermogenic differentiation of white adipose tissue. This process is mediated through the cAMP-EPAC1-ERK signaling pathway, which enhances mitochondrial function and increases the expression of thermogenic markers such as UCP1. This signaling is crucial for the proliferation and differentiation of adipose precursors, particularly under cold exposure, and is specific to the EDN3 ligand (Wang2024Endothelin).

In endothelial cells, EDNRB contributes to nitric oxide production, promoting vasodilation and maintaining vascular health. This function is mediated through the PI3K pathway, which enhances nitric oxide production and is crucial for vascular protective effects (Park2016Insulin). EDNRB also plays a role in neural crest cell migration and differentiation, as well as in pigmentation and neural crest development (Mazzuca2012Vascular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EDNRB gene are associated with several genetic disorders, most notably Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) and Waardenburg syndrome (WS). HSCR is a congenital condition characterized by the absence of enteric ganglion cells in the intestines, leading to severe constipation or intestinal obstruction. Mutations in EDNRB, such as the Trp276Cys hypomorphic mutation, contribute to HSCR susceptibility, often in conjunction with mutations in the RET gene, indicating a complex genetic interaction (Carrasquillo2002Genomewide). 

Waardenburg syndrome, particularly type IV (WS4), is another condition linked to EDNRB mutations. WS4 is characterized by a combination of sensorineural hearing loss, pigmentation anomalies, and HSCR. Mutations in EDNRB can lead to WS4, with homozygous mutations often resulting in more severe phenotypes (Pingault2010Review; Sangkhathat2005Novel). 

EDNRB mutations are also implicated in Waardenburg syndrome type II (WS2), which primarily involves hearing loss and pigmentation defects. In WS2, heterozygous mutations in EDNRB are observed, with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity (Issa2017EDNRBmutations). These mutations affect the endothelin signaling pathway, crucial for neural crest development.

## Interactions
EDNRB (endothelin receptor type B) is a G-protein-coupled receptor that interacts with endothelin peptides, specifically endothelin-1 (EDN1), endothelin-2 (EDN2), and endothelin-3 (EDN3). These interactions are crucial for various physiological processes, including melanocyte development and function. EDNRB activation by these peptides leads to the phosphorylation of the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) through the MAPK pathway, involving ERK1/2 and MEK phosphorylation (Sato‐Jin2007Epistatic). 

EDNRB also interacts with GNA11, a G-protein involved in intracellular signaling cascades that activate protein kinase C (PKC) and lead to ERK phosphorylation, further influencing MITF activity and melanogenesis (Ho2010Protein). The receptor's interaction with EDN3 is particularly significant for melanoblast proliferation and survival during development (Shin1997Molecular).

In the context of Hirschsprung disease, EDNRB interacts with the RET receptor tyrosine kinase, suggesting a genetic interaction between these pathways that affects the enteric nervous system (McCallion2003Phenotype; Carrasquillo2002Genomewide). These interactions highlight EDNRB's role in both normal physiological processes and disease states.
