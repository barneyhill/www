# IPPK

## Overview
Inositol-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase (IPPK) is a gene that encodes the enzyme inositol-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase, a member of the kinase family of proteins. This enzyme is pivotal in the biosynthesis of inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) from inositol pentakisphosphate (IP5), a process integral to various cellular functions, including mRNA export and cell cycle regulation. The IPPK protein is characterized by a distinct structural configuration, featuring an N-lobe and C-lobe connected by a hinge region, which facilitates substrate binding and catalysis (FrancoEchevarría2017The). The enzyme's activity is crucial for cellular homeostasis, influencing processes such as cell proliferation and immune response regulation (Okamura2018Depletion). Additionally, IPPK plays a role in the assembly of HIV-1 particles, highlighting its significance in viral pathogenesis (Ricana2020Inositol).

## Structure
The IPPK protein, also known as inositol-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase, is characterized by a structure that includes two main lobes: the N-lobe and the C-lobe, connected by a hinge region. The N-lobe contains a β-sheet formed by five antiparallel β-strands and two helical segments, with the first segment containing a helix equivalent to the αC helix found in all protein kinases (FrancoEchevarría2017The). The C-lobe features a β-sheet core with three helical segments forming a large helical ensemble named the CIP lobe, which is specific to IP 5 2-K enzymes and forms most of the inositide substrate binding site (FrancoEchevarría2017The).

The enzyme's active site is involved in substrate recognition through polar and hydrophobic interactions, with specific residues coordinating the binding of adenine, ribose, and phosphate groups (FrancoEchevarría2017The). A notable feature of the IPPK structure is a basic patch on its surface, primarily concentrated around the active site, formed by specific regions including α6, α8 in CIP-I, and a large insert in the CIP-II region (FrancoEchevarría2017The).

The IPPK protein also contains a zinc-binding site, which may stabilize certain protein regions and serve as an interface for other partners essential for the enzyme's function (FrancoEchevarría2017The). The enzyme's structure is characterized by a dynamic CL3 loop, which is disordered in mIP 5 2-K, suggesting a role in catalysis regulation (FrancoEchevarría2017The).

## Function
IPPK, or inositol-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase, is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the synthesis of inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) from inositol pentakisphosphate (IP5). This conversion is essential for various cellular processes. IP6 is a highly conserved signaling molecule involved in mRNA export at the cytoplasmic surface of the nuclear pore complex. It enhances the activity of the DEAD-box RNA helicase DBP5, which is necessary for the remodeling of messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes during mRNA export (Okamura2018Depletion). 

IPPK is also implicated in cell proliferation and immune response regulation. Knockdown of IPPK results in the accumulation of poly(A)+ RNA in the nucleus, indicating its role in mRNA export. This knockdown also affects cell proliferation, slowing down growth rates and leading to G1/S cell cycle arrest (Okamura2018Depletion). 

In addition to its role in mRNA export, IPPK is involved in the production of infectious HIV-1 particles, as IP6 is a critical co-factor for the proper assembly of the HIV-1 Gag protein into viral particles (Ricana2020Inositol). The enzyme is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing cellular homeostasis and growth.
