# KANK4

## Overview
KANK4 is a gene that encodes the protein KN motif and ankyrin repeat domains 4, which is part of the Kank family of proteins. This family is characterized by the presence of ankyrin-repeat domains and coiled-coil motifs, although KANK4 uniquely lacks a coiled-coil domain in its central region (Chen2018The). The KANK4 protein plays a crucial role in cytoskeletal organization and cell signaling, primarily through its involvement in actin dynamics and stress fiber formation (Zhu2008Kank). The protein's structure includes ankyrin-repeat domains that facilitate protein-protein interactions and a KN motif that may be involved in nuclear transport (Zhu2008Kank). KANK4 is implicated in maintaining cell shape, motility, and adhesion, and its dysfunction is associated with various medical conditions, including focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, intellectual disabilities, and certain cancers (Lepori2018Clinical; Gaule2022Exceptional).

## Structure
The KANK4 protein is part of the Kank family, which includes four paralogues: Kank1, Kank2, Kank3, and Kank4. These proteins are characterized by the presence of ankyrin-repeat domains and coiled-coil motifs. KANK4 contains five repeats of the ankyrin-repeat motif, a basic structural feature that is highly conserved across the Kank family (Zhu2008Kank). The ankyrin-repeat domains are known for mediating protein-protein interactions, contributing to the protein's secondary and tertiary structures (Zhu2008Kank).

KANK4 also contains a conserved region near the N-terminus called the KN motif, which includes a leucine-rich and an arginine-rich region. This motif is located at amino acids 24-65 in KANK4 and contains potential nuclear localization and export signals, suggesting a role in nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling (Zhu2008Kank). The primary structure of KANK4 is defined by its amino acid sequence, while the secondary structure includes the ankyrin-repeats and coiled-coil motifs (Zhu2008Kank).

Unlike other Kank proteins, KANK4 lacks a coiled-coil domain in the central region, which is present in other family members (Chen2018The). The quaternary structure of KANK4 would depend on potential interactions with other proteins, although specific details are not provided in the available context (Zhu2008Kank).

## Function
KANK4 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cytoskeletal organization and cell signaling. The protein contains ankyrin-repeat domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, and is characterized by a KN motif that may play a role in nuclear transport (Zhu2008Kank). KANK4 is implicated in maintaining cell shape, motility, and adhesion, primarily influencing actin dynamics in the cytoplasm (Zhu2008Kank). The protein is involved in the formation of actin stress fibers, suggesting a role in cytoskeletal organization (Zhu2008Kank).

KANK4 is also associated with the regulation of actin reorganization and cell contractility, which are essential for various cellular processes (Cabantous2017Evidence). The protein's involvement in these processes indicates its potential role in maintaining cellular structure and function. Although specific functions of KANK4 in healthy human cells are not extensively detailed, its general role in cytoskeletal dynamics and cell signaling is evident from its structural features and expression patterns (Cabantous2017Evidence; Zhu2008Kank). The protein's activity in the cytoplasm and its influence on actin dynamics highlight its importance in cellular architecture and movement.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the KANK4 gene have been implicated in several medical conditions. KANK4 mutations are associated with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS), particularly with early childhood onset. These mutations can also be linked to intellectual disability, facial dysmorphism, and atrial septal defect (Lepori2018Clinical). 

In the context of psychiatric disorders, rare variants in KANK4 have been identified as potential contributors to bipolar disorder in specific familial cases. This suggests a possible genetic link between KANK4 and the development of bipolar disorder, although further research is needed to confirm these associations (Anjanappa2019A).

KANK4 has also been implicated in cancer, specifically pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma (PACC). A novel gene fusion involving KANK4 and the ALK gene was identified in a patient with PACC, and treatment targeting this fusion led to a significant clinical response. This finding highlights the potential of KANK4-ALK fusions as therapeutic targets in certain cancers (Gaule2022Exceptional).

These associations underscore the clinical significance of KANK4 in various diseases, emphasizing the need for further research to fully understand its role in disease pathogenesis.
