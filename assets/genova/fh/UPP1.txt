# UPP1

## Overview
Uridine phosphorylase 1 (UPP1) is a gene that encodes the enzyme uridine phosphorylase 1, which plays a critical role in the pyrimidine salvage pathway. This enzyme is categorized as a phosphorylase and is involved in the reversible phosphorolysis of uridine to uracil and ribose-1-phosphate, a process essential for nucleotide metabolism and RNA synthesis (Huang2020Metabolites; Roosild2009Implications). UPP1 is expressed in various tissues and is crucial for maintaining uridine homeostasis, impacting cellular processes such as RNA and DNA synthesis, energy production, and the activation of chemotherapeutic agents (Skinner2023Salvage; Renck2013Design). The enzyme's activity is modulated by factors like vitamin D, which can enhance its protective effects against DNA damage (Bhasin2018Vitamin). UPP1's interactions with viral proteins and its involvement in cancer progression underscore its significance in both health and disease (Whyte2024Uridine; Xu2024Nucleotide).

## Structure
Human uridine phosphorylase 1 (hUPP1) is a dimeric enzyme involved in the pyrimidine salvage pathway, catalyzing the reversible phosphorolysis of uridine to uracil and ribose-1-phosphate (Huang2020Metabolites; Roosild2009Implications). The primary structure of hUPP1 consists of 310 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 33.9 kDa (Huang2020Metabolites). 

The secondary structure of hUPP1 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, with notable differences from microbial homologues, such as additional architecture at the N-terminus and a strand-turn-strand motif replacing the third α-helix (Roosild2009Implications). These structural features increase the buried surface area of the dimer interface by about 18% (Roosild2009Implications).

In terms of tertiary structure, hUPP1 exhibits significant inter-domain motion upon substrate binding, which facilitates the closure of the active site (Roosild2009Implications). This motion is unique to eukaryotic enzymes and is not observed in prokaryotic homologues due to their hexameric assembly (Roosild2010Active).

The quaternary structure of hUPP1 is characterized by its dimeric nature, contrasting with the hexameric assembly seen in microbial uridine phosphorylases (Roosild2009Implications). This dimeric form contributes to the enzyme's flexibility and functional dynamics (Roosild2010Active).

## Function
Uridine phosphorylase 1 (UPP1) is a key enzyme in the pyrimidine salvage pathway, which is crucial for maintaining uridine homeostasis in human cells. It catalyzes the reversible phosphorolysis of uridine to uracil and ribose-1-phosphate, a process essential for the synthesis of RNA and DNA (Roosild2010Active; Renck2013Design). UPP1 is widely distributed in tissues and plays a significant role in regulating uridine levels, which are important for various cellular processes, including RNA and biomembrane synthesis, galactose metabolism, and activities in the peripheral and central nervous systems (Renck2013Design).

The enzyme's activity is linked to the salvage of ribose from uridine or RNA, supporting glycolysis, especially under nutrient-limited conditions (Skinner2023Salvage). UPP1-expressing cells can utilize uridine as an alternative energy source when glucose is unavailable, indicating its role in energy production and biosynthesis (Skinner2023Salvage). UPP1 is also involved in the activation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues used in chemotherapy, such as 5-fluorouracil, by converting them into active forms that exert anti-cancer activity (Roosild2010Active). The enzyme's activity is regulated by various factors, including vitamin D, which can up-regulate UPP1 expression and enhance its protective effects against DNA damage (Bhasin2018Vitamin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the UPP1 gene have been implicated in the progression of several cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma and gliomas. In lung adenocarcinoma, high UPP1 expression is associated with the induction of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which facilitates tumor progression by increasing PD-L1 expression through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. This leads to immune evasion by impairing the cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells, contributing to poorer patient outcomes (Li2024UPP1). UPP1 overexpression in lung adenocarcinoma is also linked to increased sensitivity to certain drugs, such as Bosutinib and Dasatinib, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies (Li2024UPP1).

In gliomas, UPP1 acts as a key oncogene, promoting tumor cell proliferation and invasion while suppressing anti-tumor immune responses. High UPP1 expression correlates with poor survival rates and is associated with immune escape mechanisms, including altered macrophage activity and cytokine production (Chen2024Machine). These findings highlight UPP1's role in tumorigenesis and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
Uridine phosphorylase 1 (UPP1) is involved in several interactions with other proteins, influencing various cellular processes. One notable interaction is with the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) N protein. Studies have shown that UPP1 interacts with the PEDV N protein, which is crucial for viral replication and pathogenesis. This interaction appears to inhibit viral replication, suggesting a protective role for UPP1 against PEDV infection (Xu2024Nucleotide).

UPP1 also interacts with RNA polymerase II subunit (RPB2), another host protein involved in nucleotide metabolism. While RPB2 enhances PEDV replication, UPP1's interaction with the PEDV N protein results in decreased expression levels of the viral protein, indicating an inhibitory effect on viral replication (Xu2024Nucleotide).

In the context of cancer, UPP1 is implicated in altering immune responses and the extracellular matrix (ECM) landscape, particularly in mammary cancer metastasis. It affects neutrophil behavior and T-cell proliferation, contributing to an immunosuppressive environment that facilitates metastasis. UPP1's role in ECM deposition, especially fibronectin, further supports its involvement in cancer progression (Whyte2024Uridine).
