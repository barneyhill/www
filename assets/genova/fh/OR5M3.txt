# OR5M3

## Overview
The OR5M3 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 5 subfamily M member 3, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein is involved in the detection of odorant molecules, playing a crucial role in the olfactory system by initiating neuronal responses that lead to the perception of smell. As a transmembrane receptor, it spans the cell membrane and transduces extracellular signals through the activation of intracellular G-proteins. The olfactory receptor family is characterized by a 7-transmembrane domain structure, similar to many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors, which allows it to interact with a wide variety of odorant molecules (Qiu2020aarFDC).
