# RUNDC1

## Overview
RUNDC1 (RUN domain containing 1) is a gene that encodes a cytoplasmic protein involved in the regulation of several critical cellular processes, including the modulation of the p53 pathway, which is essential for cell cycle control and apoptosis. The RUNDC1 protein functions as a potential antagonist of p53, influencing transcriptional activity and cellular responses to stress, such as hypoxic conditions, where it acts as a p53/TP53 inhibitor (Léger2021Hypoxic; Jalali2015Targeted). Additionally, RUNDC1 plays a role in immune response regulation, as evidenced by its involvement in DNA methylation and gene expression changes following influenza vaccination, suggesting its importance in immune cell growth and differentiation (Zimmermann2016SystemWide). Through its interactions with other proteins, RUNDC1 impacts signaling pathways that are crucial for cellular function and development.

## Structure


## Function
RUNDC1 (RUN domain containing 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of the p53 pathway. The RUNDC1 protein has been identified as a regulator of p53, acting as a potential antagonist. Interference with RUNDC1 has been shown to increase p53 transcription, suggesting that RUNDC1 may play a role in modulating p53 activity, which is crucial for cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Jalali2015Targeted).

In the context of hypoxic conditions, RUNDC1 is thought to act as a p53/TP53 inhibitor, which may contribute to cell cycle regulation and angiogenesis. This suggests that RUNDC1 could be involved in cellular responses to stress and may influence processes such as cell proliferation and survival under low oxygen conditions (Léger2021Hypoxic).

RUNDC1 is also implicated in immune response regulation. It has been associated with DNA methylation and gene expression changes in response to influenza vaccination, indicating a potential role in immune cell growth and differentiation (Zimmermann2016SystemWide). The protein is typically active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with other proteins to modulate signaling cascades, impacting cellular functions and organismal development.
