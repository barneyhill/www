# GPR179

## Overview
GPR179 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 179 (GPR179), a transmembrane receptor primarily expressed in the retina. This receptor is classified as an orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) due to the absence of identified endogenous ligands (Orlandi2013Orphan). GPR179 plays a crucial role in the visual system, particularly in the function of depolarizing bipolar cells (DBCs), which are essential for processing visual signals under low-light conditions (Ray2014GPR179). The protein is involved in forming macromolecular complexes with key components of the metabotropic signaling cascade, ensuring proper synaptic responses and signal transduction in ON-bipolar neurons (Orlandi2013Orphan). Mutations in the GPR179 gene are linked to autosomal-recessive complete congenital stationary night blindness (cCSNB), highlighting its significance in maintaining normal visual function (Peachey2012GPR179).

## Structure
The GPR179 protein is an orphan G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) with a complex molecular structure. Its extracellular domain (ECD) features a distinct architecture, including an N-terminal α-helical region, a central globular Cache domain, and a C-terminal stalk region. The Cache domain is characterized by six antiparallel β-sheets supported by two α-helices, forming a β-barrel-like fold when dimerized (Patil2023Structure). The ECD is connected to the transmembrane (TM) domain through the stalk region, which contains flexible loops and potential disulfide bridges (Patil2023Structure).

The intracellular C-terminus of GPR179 is suggested to form homodimers through a specific sequence that adopts an α-helical structure, assembling into a coiled-coil (Bachert2021Homodimerization). This region, consisting of 64 amino acids, is crucial for dimerization and may influence the post-synaptic localization of G-protein signaling regulators (Bachert2021Homodimerization).

GPR179 interacts with the extracellular matrix protein pikachurin, forming a tetrameric assembly through its Cache domains and pikachurin's LG3 domains. This interaction involves extensive hydrophilic and ionic interactions, with specific residues playing crucial roles (Patil2023Structure). The structural integrity of GPR179 is essential for its function in synaptic organization and signal transduction (Patil2023Structure).

## Function
GPR179 is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a critical role in the function of depolarizing bipolar cells (DBCs) in the retina. It is essential for the synaptic responses of ON-bipolar cells, which are crucial for vision under dim light conditions. GPR179 forms macromolecular complexes with key components of the metabotropic signaling cascade, including the mGluR6 receptor, TRPM1 channel, and RGS proteins. These interactions ensure the proper localization and function of these components, facilitating optimal signal transduction in ON-bipolar neurons (Orlandi2013Orphan).

GPR179 is involved in recruiting RGS7 and RGS11 proteins to the dendritic tips of DBCs, which are necessary for the modulation of the TRPM1 channel by mGluR6. This recruitment is crucial for maintaining the high sensitivity of the mGluR6 signaling cascade, which is essential for normal visual processing (Ray2014GPR179). The absence of GPR179 leads to a significant reduction in the sensitivity of this cascade, resulting in compromised visual responses (Ray2014GPR179).

GPR179 also interacts with the extracellular matrix protein Pikachurin, which is part of the dystroglycan complex. This interaction is essential for the synaptic organization of photoreceptors, influencing the kinetics and sensitivity of synaptic responses in the retina (Orlandi2018Transsynaptic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GPR179 gene are associated with autosomal-recessive complete congenital stationary night blindness (cCSNB), a retinal disorder characterized by impaired night vision and the absence of the electroretinogram (ERG) b-wave. This condition results from a defect in signal transmission from photoreceptors to depolarizing bipolar cells (DBCs) in the retina (Audo2012WholeExome; Peachey2012GPR179). 

In humans, mutations such as frameshift and missense mutations in GPR179 lead to predicted protein truncations or affect conserved amino acid residues, resulting in pathogenic outcomes. These mutations can cause nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, potentially leading to the absence of a protein product or a truncated protein lacking transmembrane domains (Audo2012WholeExome). 

In animal models, such as the Gpr179 nob5/nob5 mouse, the absence of the ERG b-wave indicates abnormal synaptic transmission between photoreceptors and DBCs, mirroring the human condition (Peachey2012GPR179). The GPR179 gene is also involved in the synaptic organization of photoreceptors, interacting with the dystroglycan-pikachurin complex. Disruptions in this interaction can lead to significant visual deficits, as seen in conditions like Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Orlandi2018Transsynaptic).

## Interactions
GPR179, a G protein-coupled receptor, is involved in several critical interactions within the retina, particularly in ON-bipolar neurons. It forms macromolecular complexes with key components of the metabotropic signaling cascade, including the mGluR6 receptor, TRPM1 channel, and RGS proteins. These interactions are essential for the proper functioning of the signaling cascade that mediates the depolarizing response to light (Orlandi2013Orphan).

GPR179 interacts with the extracellular matrix protein pikachurin, forming a complex that is crucial for synaptic organization in photoreceptors. This interaction involves the Cache domain of GPR179 and the LG3 domains of pikachurin, which bind at the apex of each Cache domain, forming a tetrameric assembly with extensive hydrophilic and ionic interactions (Orlandi2018Transsynaptic; Patil2023Structure). Pikachurin acts as a bridge connecting the presynaptic dystroglycan complex with GPR179 on the postsynaptic site, facilitating the recruitment of the post-synaptic GAP complex composed of GPR179 and RGS7/11 proteins (Orlandi2018Transsynaptic).

GPR179 also binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), which may act as co-receptors, forming ternary complexes necessary for activating signaling cascades (Orlandi2018Transsynaptic). These interactions highlight GPR179's role in coordinating synaptic development and function.
