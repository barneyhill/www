# USP17L13

## Overview
USP17L13 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquitin specific peptidase 17 like family member 13, which is part of the ubiquitin-specific peptidase family. This family of proteins is involved in the removal of ubiquitin from ubiquitinated proteins, a critical process in the regulation of protein degradation, signaling, and cellular homeostasis. The USP17L13 protein is implicated in various biological processes, including apoptosis regulation and immune response, as suggested by its interactions within protein-protein interaction networks and its regulation by retrotransposons (Nikitin2018Profiling; Zhang2019An). Additionally, the gene's expression and regulation are of interest in the context of certain conditions, such as Angelman Syndrome, where it is associated with DNA methylation patterns (Panov2022An).

## Interactions
USP17L13 is identified as a hub gene in the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network associated with C3dg in keratinocytes. The study by Zhang et al. highlights USP17L13's potential role in these interactions, suggesting its involvement in the network of genes and proteins that respond to C3dg overexpression. This includes interactions with other hub genes such as COL6A3, GNB3, and CYP2E1, which are consistently detected in the PPI mapping (Zhang2019An).

In the context of Angelman Syndrome, USP17L13 is noted for its regulation of apoptosis, with hyper-methylation near its promoter region. This suggests a potential interaction with DNA methylation processes, although specific protein interactions are not detailed (Panov2022An).

The regulation of USP17L13 by retrotransposons is also noted, indicating that it is among the most strongly regulated protein-coding genes in the context of ubiquitin-specific peptidases. This regulation may involve interactions with transcription factor binding sites, impacting various biological processes such as immunity and protein degradation (Nikitin2018Profiling). However, specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed in the provided context.
