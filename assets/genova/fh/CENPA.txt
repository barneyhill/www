# CENPA

## Overview
CENPA is a gene that encodes the centromere protein A (CENP-A), a histone H3 variant that plays a pivotal role in centromere identity and function. CENP-A is a specialized histone protein that replaces canonical histone H3 in centromeric nucleosomes, thereby facilitating the assembly and maintenance of the kinetochore, a critical structure for chromosome segregation during cell division (Orthaus2007Assembly; Maehara2010CENPA). The unique structural properties of CENP-A, including its ability to form compact and rigid nucleosome structures, are essential for distinguishing centromeric chromatin from the rest of the chromosome and ensuring proper centromere function (Quénet2012The; Schalch2016Structure). CENP-A's interactions with various proteins, such as the chaperone HJURP and centromeric protein CENP-C, are crucial for its incorporation into centromeric chromatin and kinetochore assembly (Mahlke2020Guarding; RenaudPageot2022CENPA). Dysregulation of CENPA expression is associated with chromosomal instability and has been implicated in the progression of several cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Saha2020The; Sun2016Elevated).

## Structure
CENPA, a histone H3 variant, is integral to centromere identity and function. Its primary structure includes a histone fold domain (HFD), which is crucial for DNA binding and centromere targeting. This domain consists of three α helices separated by two turn-β-sheet structures, with a central portion, including strand A and helix II, being highly conserved and essential for centromeric localization (Wieland2004Functional).

The secondary structure of CENPA features α helices typical of histone proteins, contributing to its ability to form nucleosome-like complexes. The tertiary structure involves the formation of a nucleosome, where CENPA replaces canonical histone H3 at the centromere, creating a unique chromatin organization (Schalch2016Structure).

CENPA can form quaternary structures by incorporating into nucleosomes at the centromere. These nucleosomes are distinct from canonical H3 nucleosomes, as they bind a shorter DNA fragment (120-125 bp) and exhibit a more compact and rigid (CENP-A-H4)2 tetramer (Quénet2012The; Zhou2022CENPN).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a role in regulating CENPA's function and localization. For instance, dephosphorylation of serine 68 is necessary for the stability of its interaction with the histone chaperone HJURP, which is crucial for targeting CENPA to the centromere (Schalch2016Structure).

## Function
CENPA encodes a centromere-specific histone H3 variant, CENP-A, which is crucial for the assembly and function of the kinetochore, a protein complex essential for chromosome segregation during mitosis and meiosis (Orthaus2007Assembly; Maehara2010CENPA). CENP-A replaces histone H3 in centromeric nucleosomes, facilitating the recruitment of other inner kinetochore proteins such as CENP-B, CENP-C, and CENP-H, which are necessary for proper kinetochore function (Orthaus2007Assembly). This replacement is critical for maintaining centromere identity and distinguishing it from the rest of the chromosome (Orthaus2007Assembly).

CENP-A is present at the centromere throughout the cell cycle and forms a subnucleosomal tetramer complex with histone H4, which is more compact and conformationally rigid than the corresponding tetramers of histones H3 and H4 (Orthaus2007Assembly). This unique nucleosome structure is thought to prevent aneuploidy, a condition that can lead to cancer (Orthaus2007Assembly). The proper deposition of CENP-A is vital for centromere inheritance and function, and its reduction can lead to cellular senescence, a state of irreversible growth arrest, which acts as a self-defense mechanism to prevent the proliferation of cells with defective centromeres (Maehara2010CENPA).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CENPA gene, which encodes the centromere protein A, are significantly associated with various cancers. Overexpression of CENP-A is linked to chromosomal instability and aneuploidy, contributing to cancer progression and poor prognosis in several cancer types, including breast, lung, gastric, and prostate cancers (Saha2020The; Sun2016Elevated). In breast cancer, high levels of CENP-A are associated with aggressive subtypes such as triple-negative breast cancer, correlating with poor survival outcomes and advanced tumor stages (Sun2016Elevated). 

In hepatocellular carcinoma, CENP-A overexpression promotes cell-cycle progression and tumor growth, while its depletion leads to cell cycle arrest and increased apoptosis (Li2011ShRNATargeted). In clear cell renal cell carcinoma, CENP-A overexpression activates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, promoting cancer progression and metastasis (Wang2021CENPA). 

CENP-A mislocalization outside the centromere can lead to the formation of ectopic neocentromeres, causing genomic instability and contributing to tumorigenesis (RenaudPageot2022CENPA). Despite its overexpression, mutations in CENP-A are rare and not significantly linked to cancer development (Sun2016Elevated).

## Interactions
CENP-A, a histone H3 variant, is integral to centromere function and interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids to maintain centromeric chromatin. It primarily interacts with the chaperone HJURP (Holliday Junction Recognition Protein), which facilitates its specific incorporation into centromeric chromatin. This interaction is mediated by the CENP-A targeting domain (CATD) in HJURP, and is regulated by posttranslational modifications such as S69 phosphorylation and K124 ubiquitylation, which enhance HJURP binding (RenaudPageot2022CENPA).

CENP-A also interacts with the Mis18 complex, which recruits HJURP to the centromere during telophase/early G1 phase (RenaudPageot2022CENPA). CENP-C, another centromeric protein, stabilizes its interaction with CENP-A nucleosomes during M phase, facilitating the recruitment of Mis18 (RenaudPageot2022CENPA). CENP-A's interaction with CENP-C is crucial for kinetochore assembly and is regulated by phosphorylation, which is important for kinetochore localization during mitosis (Mahlke2020Guarding).

In cancer cells, CENP-A shows increased association with transcription-coupled chaperones DAXX and ATRX, forming stable octameric nucleosomes that localize to noncentromeric locations such as promoters and transcription factor binding sites (Athwal2015CENPA). These interactions suggest a role for CENP-A in gene regulation and chromosomal stability.
