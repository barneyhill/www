# FBXO17

## Overview
FBXO17 is a gene that encodes the F-box protein 17, a member of the F-box protein family, which is integral to the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex. This protein is characterized by the presence of an F-box motif, which is essential for mediating protein-protein interactions within the complex. F-box protein 17 plays a pivotal role in targeting specific proteins for ubiquitination, a process that marks them for degradation by the proteasome, thereby regulating various cellular functions such as signal transduction and cell cycle progression (Suber2018FBXO17). The gene's expression and function have been implicated in several cancers, where it may act as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor, depending on the context and type of cancer (Zheng2022FBXO17; Du2018Clinical).

## Clinical Significance
FBXO17 has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In lung adenocarcinoma, FBXO17 is overexpressed, leading to increased cell proliferation and survival through the activation of the Akt signaling pathway. This overexpression is associated with enhanced activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and ERK pathways, contributing to tumorigenesis (Suber2018FBXO17). Conversely, in endometrial cancer, particularly uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), FBXO17 is downregulated. This downregulation is linked to higher histological grades and abnormal cell proliferation, suggesting a tumor suppressor role by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Zheng2022FBXO17).

In high-grade glioma, including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), high FBXO17 expression correlates with poorer survival outcomes, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker. Patients with elevated FBXO17 levels have shorter overall survival, independent of other factors like IDH1 mutation status (Du2018Clinical). These findings highlight the complex role of FBXO17 in cancer, acting as an oncogene in some contexts and a tumor suppressor in others, depending on the cancer type and cellular environment.

## Interactions
FBXO17 is a member of the F-box protein family, which is characterized by the presence of an F-box motif that facilitates protein-protein interactions. As part of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex, FBXO17 plays a role in targeting specific proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. This process is crucial for regulating various cellular functions, including signal transduction and cell cycle progression. The interactions of FBXO17 within the SCF complex involve binding with SKP1 and CUL1, which are core components of the complex, allowing it to recruit substrates for ubiquitination. While specific substrates of FBXO17 have not been detailed in the provided context, its role in the SCF complex suggests it may interact with proteins involved in critical cellular pathways, potentially influencing processes such as cell cycle regulation and signal transduction. The precise nature of these interactions and the specific proteins targeted by FBXO17 remain areas for further research.
