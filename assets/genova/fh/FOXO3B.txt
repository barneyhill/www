# FOXO3B

## Overview
FOXO3B is a gene that encodes the forkhead box O3B protein, which is a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors. These proteins are characterized by a distinct forkhead domain, which is involved in DNA binding and plays a crucial role in regulating the expression of genes involved in various cellular processes, including metabolism, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis. The forkhead box O3B protein is particularly significant in the context of oxidative stress response and longevity, as it modulates pathways that influence cellular resistance to oxidative damage. Dysregulation of FOXO3B has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer and age-related disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Qiu2020aarFDC).
