# MSANTD3

## Overview
The MSANTD3 gene encodes the Myb/SANT DNA binding domain containing 3 protein, which is primarily involved in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation. This protein is characterized by the presence of a Myb/SANT domain, a feature that categorizes it as a DNA-binding protein with potential roles in chromatin dynamics and gene expression modulation. The MSANTD3 protein is localized in the nucleus and is implicated in interactions with histone methyltransferases, such as SUV39H1, suggesting its involvement in chromatin regulation processes (Barasch2017Recurrent). Additionally, MSANTD3 has been identified as a potential interacting partner of the influenza A virus nucleoprotein, indicating a possible role in viral pathogenesis through modulation of host gene transcription (Generous2014Identification). The gene has also been associated with certain oncogenic processes, particularly in salivary gland acinic cell carcinoma, where it is involved in recurrent genetic rearrangements (Andreasen2019The; Barasch2017Recurrent).

## Structure
The MSANTD3 protein is composed of 275 amino acids and has a predicted molecular weight of 32 kD (Barasch2017Recurrent). It contains a Myb/SANT domain located within the N-terminus, which functions as a DNA-binding domain. This domain is commonly associated with proteins involved in chromatin remodeling and histone modification, suggesting a role in chromatin dynamics (Barasch2017Recurrent). The protein is highly conserved among tetrapods, including mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians, but shows less conservation in ray-finned fish. Interestingly, the coelacanth, a lobe-finned fish, possesses an MSANTD3 protein more similar to those of land vertebrates, indicating evolutionary conservation (Barasch2017Recurrent).

The MSANTD3 protein is localized in the nucleus, as observed through immunostaining, which supports its involvement in chromatin regulation (Barasch2017Recurrent). It has been identified as a putative binding partner of the histone methyltransferase SUV39H1, further implicating it in chromatin regulation processes (Barasch2017Recurrent). The specific details regarding the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, as well as post-translational modifications or splice variants, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The MSANTD3 gene encodes a protein that contains Myb/SANT-like DNA-binding domains, which are crucial for its role in transcription regulation and chromatin remodeling. The Myb domain is associated with proto-oncogenes necessary for hematopoiesis and may be involved in tumorigenesis, while the SANT domain allows chromatin remodeling proteins to interact with histones, facilitating changes in chromatin structure and gene expression (Generous2014Identification). This protein is typically active in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA to modulate transcriptional activity, influencing cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and differentiation (Generous2014Identification).

In the context of viral infections, MSANTD3 has been identified as a potential interacting partner of the influenza A virus nucleoprotein (NP). This interaction suggests that MSANTD3 may play a role in modifying host gene transcription through chromatin modification, potentially affecting the expression of antiviral genes or those beneficial to viral replication (Generous2014Identification). However, the specific function of MSANTD3 in healthy human cells remains less detailed, with its primary role being implicated in protein-protein interactions with viral components (Generous2014Identification).

## Clinical Significance
The MSANTD3 gene has been implicated in the pathogenesis of salivary gland acinic cell carcinoma (AcCC) through recurrent rearrangements and overexpression. These rearrangements are observed in approximately 15% of AcCC cases and are associated with the upregulation of genes involved in protein synthesis, suggesting an oncogenic driver role (Barasch2017Recurrent). The HTN3-MSANTD3 fusion gene, a specific rearrangement, defines a subset of AcCCs, although it is found in a lower proportion of cases than initially reported, at about 4.4% (Andreasen2019The). Despite these genetic alterations, the clinical course of MSANTD3-rearranged AcCCs does not significantly differ from the generally indolent nature of the disease, indicating that these rearrangements may not have a significant clinical impact (Andreasen2019The).

MSANTD3 expression varies across different tissue types and is notably strong in certain salivary gland carcinomas, such as mucoepidermoid and adenosquamous carcinomas, but is rarely observed in brain, head, and neck tissues (Barasch2017Recurrent). Despite its potential role in cancer, no correlation has been found between MSANTD3 expression and clinical outcomes in breast cancer, such as ER or HER2 status or survival (Barasch2017Recurrent).

## Interactions
MSANTD3 is involved in several interactions with other proteins, suggesting its role in chromatin regulation and potential oncogenic activity. It has been identified as a putative binding partner of SUV39H1, a histone methyltransferase, through a yeast two-hybrid screen. This interaction implies that MSANTD3 may participate in chromatin regulation by interacting with histone methyltransferases, potentially influencing gene expression (Barasch2017Recurrent).

In the context of viral interactions, MSANTD3 has been shown to interact with the nucleoprotein (NP) of both swine and human influenza A virus (IAV). This interaction was identified using a yeast two-hybrid assay, which demonstrated that MSANTD3 could potentially affect host gene transcription through chromatin modification. This interaction might inhibit antiviral genes or up-regulate genes beneficial to viral replication, highlighting a possible role in the viral life cycle and host specificity (Generous2014Identification).

These interactions underscore the potential significance of MSANTD3 in both oncogenic processes and viral pathogenesis, although further studies are needed to fully elucidate its functional roles and mechanisms.
