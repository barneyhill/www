# OTUD6B

## Overview
OTUD6B is a gene that encodes the OTU deubiquitinase 6B protein, which is a member of the ovarian tumor (OTU) domain-containing subfamily of deubiquitinating enzymes. This protein plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a critical pathway for protein degradation and regulation within the cell (SantiagoSim2017Biallelic). The OTUD6B protein is characterized by its structural features, including an N-terminal region with coiled-coil motifs and a C-terminal OTU domain, which contribute to its function in stabilizing other proteins, such as the von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL), through non-enzymatic mechanisms (Liu2020Deubiquitylase). OTUD6B is expressed in various tissues and is involved in multiple cellular processes, including protein homeostasis and translation initiation (Sobol2017Deubiquitinase; SantiagoSim2017Biallelic). Mutations in the OTUD6B gene are linked to intellectual disability syndromes and various cancers, underscoring its clinical significance (Zhao2022Identification; RomeroIbarguengoitia2020Comparison).

## Structure
The OTUD6B protein is encoded by a gene located on chromosome 8q21.3 and consists of 314 amino acids (Liu2020Deubiquitylase). Its molecular structure includes an N-terminal region with two coiled-coil motifs and a C-terminal OTU domain, which is associated with cysteine protease activity (Liu2020Deubiquitylase). The N-terminal region is crucial for the protein's function, particularly in its interaction with pVHL, as it binds specifically to the N-terminal β-domain of pVHL (Liu2020Deubiquitylase). The OTU domain contains predicted catalytic residues, including Asp185, Cys188, and His307, although the deubiquitylation of pVHL by OTUD6B is independent of this catalytic activity (Liu2020Deubiquitylase).

OTUD6B functions in an enzyme-independent manner, suggesting that its structural features, rather than its enzymatic activity, are critical for its role in stabilizing pVHL (Liu2020Deubiquitylase). The protein is also involved in forming a complex with elongin B and elongin C, enhancing the stability of pVHL by reducing its interaction with ubiquitylating enzymes (Liu2020Deubiquitylase).

## Function
OTUD6B encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme that is part of the ovarian tumor (OTU) domain-containing subfamily, playing a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) (SantiagoSim2017Biallelic). This enzyme is involved in reversing ubiquitination, a posttranslational modification that regulates protein degradation, intracellular trafficking, and cell signaling (SantiagoSim2017Biallelic). In healthy human cells, OTUD6B contributes to the proper functioning of the proteasome by facilitating the incorporation of 19S subunits into 26S proteasomes, which are essential for degrading unneeded or damaged proteins (SantiagoSim2017Biallelic).

OTUD6B is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, heart, and liver, indicating its involvement in multiple organ systems (SantiagoSim2017Biallelic). It plays a role in maintaining protein homeostasis by regulating the chymotrypsin-like activity of the 26S proteasome complexes (SantiagoSim2017Biallelic). The enzyme's activity is crucial for normal cellular processes, such as protein synthesis and degradation, which are vital for cellular homeostasis and function (Straniero2018First).

OTUD6B also interacts with the von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL), stabilizing it by preventing its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation, which is important for cellular processes under hypoxic conditions (Liu2020Deubiquitylase). This interaction highlights OTUD6B's role in regulating protein stability and function in the cell.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the OTUD6B gene are associated with a rare intellectual disability syndrome characterized by seizures, dysmorphic features, and other multisystemic manifestations. This disorder, known as OTUD6B-related disorder, affects the central nervous system, gastrointestinal, and skeletal systems. Clinical features include poor growth, developmental delay, early-onset seizures, intellectual disability, and dysmorphic craniofacial and distal extremity features. The severity of the condition varies, with some patients experiencing severe neurodevelopmental disorders, microcephaly, lack of speech, and inability to walk, while others may have mild to moderate intellectual disability with normal speech and motor development (RomeroIbarguengoitia2020Comparison; SantiagoSim2017Biallelic).

The OTUD6B gene is also implicated in cancer, with its expression levels being upregulated in several tumors, including colorectal adenocarcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, and lung adenocarcinoma. High OTUD6B expression is linked to poor prognosis in various cancers and is associated with immune cell infiltration and immune-related genes. This suggests its potential role as an oncogene and a biomarker for prognosis and immunotherapy in cancer (Zhao2022Identification). Additionally, OTUD6B mutations can lead to congenital heart defects, urogenital anomalies, and orofacial anomalies, further highlighting its clinical significance (AbdelSalam2021OTUD6Bassociated).

## Interactions
OTUD6B interacts with various proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It is known to interact with components of the protein synthesis initiation complex, including eIF4G, eIF4A, eIF4B, and eIF4E, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation and m7GTP pulldown assays. This interaction suggests that OTUD6B destabilizes the eIF4F complex, influencing translation initiation (Sobol2017Deubiquitinase).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, OTUD6B interacts with the von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL), stabilizing it by reducing its ubiquitylation. This interaction is crucial for forming CBC VHL ligase complexes, which protect pVHL from degradation. OTUD6B's role in this process is independent of its deubiquitylase activity, relying instead on its N-terminal region (Liu2020Deubiquitylase).

OTUD6B also interacts with RIPK1 in lung adenocarcinoma, reducing its ubiquitination and increasing its stability. This interaction affects cell proliferation, apoptosis, and metastasis (Yang2024The).

Additionally, OTUD6B has been shown to interact with OTUB1, another deubiquitinating enzyme, as identified through mass spectrometry and validated by GFP-Trap and AlphaScreen assays (Weber2021Studying).
