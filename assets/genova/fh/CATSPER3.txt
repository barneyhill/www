# CATSPER3

## Overview
CATSPER3 is a gene that encodes the protein cation channel sperm associated 3, which is a critical component of the CatSper ion channel complex. This complex is a sperm-specific, transmembrane calcium ion channel essential for male fertility. The CATSPER3 protein, along with other CatSper subunits, forms a heterotetrameric structure that facilitates calcium entry into sperm cells, a process necessary for sperm motility and hyperactivation. These functions are crucial for successful fertilization, as they enable sperm to undergo hyperactivated motility, chemotaxis towards the egg, and the acrosome reaction (Sun2017The; Jin2007Catsper3). Mutations in the CATSPER3 gene can lead to impaired sperm function and male infertility, underscoring its importance in reproductive biology (Wang2020Patient; Young2023Unexplained).

## Structure
The CATSPER3 protein is a component of the CatSper channel complex, which is crucial for sperm motility. It is a transmembrane protein with six transmembrane segments, similar to other CatSper subunits, which contribute to its function as a calcium ion channel (Rahban2020CatSper:). The primary structure of CATSPER3 includes amino acid sequences that are involved in forming the channel's pore and voltage-sensing domains (Sun2017The). The secondary structure likely includes transmembrane helices, which are common in ion channels, although specific details are not provided in the context.

In terms of tertiary structure, CATSPER3, like other CatSper subunits, is involved in forming a heterotetrameric complex with CatSper1, CatSper2, and CatSper4. This quaternary structure is essential for the channel's function, as the subunits co-precipitate to form the functional pore (Rahban2020CatSper:). The CATSPER3 protein also participates in disulfide bond formation, which is crucial for the structural integrity and function of the CatSper channel (Bystroff2018Intramembranal). The protein's structure and interactions are vital for its role in regulating calcium influx, which is necessary for sperm motility and fertilization processes (NowickaBauer2021Structure).

## Function
CATSPER3 is a crucial component of the CatSper channel complex, which is a sperm-specific ion channel essential for male fertility. This channel is located in the principal piece of the sperm flagellum and is involved in regulating intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i), which is vital for sperm motility and hyperactivation (Jin2007Catsper3; Sun2017The). CATSPER3, along with other CatSper subunits, forms a tetrameric channel that facilitates calcium entry into sperm cells, a process necessary for hyperactivated motility, chemotaxis towards the egg, and the acrosome reaction (Jin2007Catsper3; Sun2017The).

The CATSPER3 protein is specifically expressed in the testis and is localized to the principal piece of the sperm tail, where it plays a critical role in enabling the hyperactivated motility required for successful fertilization (Sun2017The; Jin2007Catsper3). Mutations or disruptions in the CATSPER3 gene can lead to impaired sperm function, resulting in male infertility due to the failure of sperm to undergo the necessary hyperactivation and acrosome reaction (Wang2020Patient; Jin2007Catsper3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CATSPER3 gene are associated with male infertility, particularly due to impaired sperm function. A specific homozygous nonsense variant (c.707T>A, p.L236*) in the CATSPER3 gene has been linked to the failure of the sperm acrosome reaction, a critical process for fertilization. This mutation results in a truncated protein lacking essential regions, leading to non-syndromic male infertility despite normal sperm morphology and parameters (Wang2020Patient). 

Research has shown that CATSPER3 is crucial for sperm hyperactivated motility, a necessary condition for successful fertilization. In mice, the absence of functional CATSPER3 due to gene knockout results in infertility, highlighting its essential role in sperm motility (Jin2007Catsper3). 

In humans, defects in CATSPER3 can lead to unexplained male infertility, characterized by normal semen parameters but impaired sperm function. Men with CATSPER3 mutations often require assisted reproductive technologies, such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), to achieve conception (Young2023Unexplained). The prevalence of CatSper-related infertility, including CATSPER3 mutations, is estimated to be about 2.3% among cases of unexplained male-factor infertility (Young2023Unexplained).

## Interactions
CATSPER3 is a component of the CatSper ion channel complex, which is essential for calcium entry into spermatozoa, a critical process for sperm motility and fertility. CATSPER3 interacts with other CatSper proteins, including CATSPER1, CATSPER2, and CATSPER4, to form the functional pore of the channel. These interactions are crucial for the proper assembly and function of the CatSper complex, which is located in the flagellar principal piece of sperm cells (Rahban2020CatSper:).

The CatSper complex also includes auxiliary subunits such as CatSperβ, CatSperγ, and CatSperδ, which modulate the channel's activity and contribute to sperm maturation. CATSPER3, along with the other pore-forming subunits, co-precipitates with CATSPER1, indicating a close physical interaction necessary for channel formation (Rahban2020CatSper:).

In addition to its role in the CatSper complex, CATSPER3 is involved in the regulation of intracellular calcium concentration, which is vital for sperm motility. The absence or mutation of CATSPER3 can lead to impaired sperm function, highlighting its importance in the CatSper channel's regulatory mechanisms (Wang2020Patient; Sun2017The).
