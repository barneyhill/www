# HIF3A

## Overview
HIF3A is a gene that encodes the hypoxia-inducible factor 3 alpha (HIF-3α) protein, a member of the hypoxia-inducible factor family of transcription factors. These proteins are integral to the cellular response to hypoxia, or low oxygen conditions, by regulating the expression of genes involved in oxygen homeostasis. Unlike its counterparts HIF-1α and HIF-2α, which primarily act as transcriptional activators, HIF-3α is often considered a negative regulator of the hypoxia response pathway, although certain isoforms, such as HIF-3α2, can function as transcription activators (Tolonen2019A). The HIF-3α protein is characterized by its basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and Per-ARNT-Sim (PAS) domains, which facilitate DNA binding and dimerization, essential for its role in gene regulation under hypoxic conditions (Kristan2019Genetic). The gene's expression and function are modulated by various post-translational modifications, and its dysregulation has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including bone development disorders (Zhu2014A).

## Structure
The HIF3A protein is a member of the hypoxia-inducible factor family, characterized by its basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and Per-ARNT-Sim (PAS) domains, which are essential for DNA binding and dimerization (Kristan2019Genetic). These domains are conserved across the HIF family and play a crucial role in the protein's function under hypoxic conditions. HIF3A forms a heterodimer with the beta subunit HIF1B (ARNT) to activate gene expression by binding to hypoxia response elements (HREs) (Kristan2019Genetic).

HIF3A has multiple splice variants, which can influence its function and stability. Most variants contain an N-terminal transactivation domain (N-TAD) and a leucine zipper (LZIP) domain, instead of the C-terminal transactivation domain (C-TAD) found in other HIF proteins (Kristan2019Genetic). The N-TAD is located within an oxygen-dependent degradation domain (ODD), which regulates the protein's stability and activity in response to oxygen levels (Kristan2019Genetic).

The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as hydroxylation and ubiquitination, which are common in the HIF family and affect protein stability and degradation (Wang2015HIF3A). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of HIF3A are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The HIF3A gene encodes the hypoxia-inducible factor 3 alpha (HIF-3α) protein, which plays a crucial role in the cellular response to low oxygen levels, or hypoxia. HIF-3α is part of the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) family, which are transcription factors that regulate oxygen homeostasis in cells. Unlike HIF-1α and HIF-2α, which are well-known transcription activators, HIF-3α has been considered a negative regulator of the hypoxia response pathway. However, certain isoforms of HIF-3α, such as HIF-3α2, can act as transcription activators (Tolonen2019A).

HIF-3α2 is involved in the regulation of erythropoietin (EPO) signaling, a process critical for erythropoiesis, the production of red blood cells. It is expressed in the liver and kidney, the main EPO-producing tissues, and can upregulate EPO mRNA by binding to chromatin regions near the EPO gene (Tolonen2019A). HIF-3α2 forms αβ dimers with transactivation capacity, inducing the expression of genes like EPO, contributing to oxygen homeostasis in healthy human cells (Tolonen2019A).

HIF-3α also has a role in modulating the expression of specific target genes in response to hypoxia, although its precise functions in non-pathological conditions are less well understood compared to its role in cancer (YANG2015Progress).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the HIF3A gene have been implicated in various pathological conditions. In the context of bone development, a gain-of-function mutation in the TNNI2 gene, specifically the K175del mutation, leads to increased expression of HIF3A. This upregulation negatively impacts bone development by impairing angiogenesis and delaying endochondral ossification, which are crucial processes for normal bone growth. The mutation results in reduced VEGF expression, a key factor in angiogenesis, thereby contributing to conditions such as reduced angiogenesis and impeded ossification center formation (Zhu2014A).

The increased expression of HIF3A in mutant mice suggests a disruption in hypoxia signaling, which is essential for proper bone development. This disruption is associated with clinical features observed in distal arthrogryposis type 2B (DA2B), such as limb abnormalities and small body size (Zhu2014A). The findings highlight the potential clinical significance of HIF3A expression changes in bone-related pathologies, suggesting that alterations in HIF3A expression or its interaction with other proteins can significantly impact bone development and angiogenesis (Zhu2014A).

## Interactions
HIF3A, specifically its variant HIF-3α4, interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in regulating hypoxia-inducible gene expression. HIF-3α4 acts as a dominant-negative regulator of HIF-1 by binding to HIF-1α and ARNT proteins. This interaction inhibits the binding of the HIF-1 complex to hypoxia-responsive elements (HREs), thereby reducing HIF-1-mediated transcriptional activity (Maynard2005Human). Unlike the HIF-1α/ARNT complex, HIF-3α4 combined with ARNT does not bind to HREs due to the absence of the PAS-associated C-terminal (PAC) domain, which is crucial for DNA binding (Maynard2005Human).

HIF-3α4 can also interact with ARNT independently of HIF-1α, as demonstrated by co-precipitation experiments in HEK293A cells (Maynard2005Human). This interaction suggests that HIF-3α4 can modulate transcriptional responses to hypoxia by interfering with the formation of functional HIF-1α/ARNT complexes. The presence of full bHLH/PASa and PASb dimerization domains in HIF-3α4 facilitates these interactions (Maynard2005Human).

Additionally, HIF-3α2, another variant of HIF3A, has been shown to bind to HREs in the promoter regions of genes like ANGPTL4 and HIST1H2BK, indicating its role in transcriptional regulation under hypoxic conditions (Tolonen2019A).
