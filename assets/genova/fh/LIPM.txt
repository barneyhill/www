# LIPM

## Overview
The LIPM gene encodes the protein lipase family member M, which is part of the lipase family of enzymes. These enzymes are primarily involved in the hydrolysis of lipids, playing a crucial role in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. Lipase family member M is characterized by its ability to catalyze the breakdown of triglycerides into free fatty acids and glycerol, a process essential for the mobilization of stored fats. The gene and its encoded protein are of significant interest due to their potential implications in metabolic disorders and their role in various physiological processes. Understanding the structure, function, and interactions of LIPM is vital for elucidating its contribution to lipid metabolism and its potential impact on human health.
