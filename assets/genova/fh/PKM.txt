# PKM

## Overview
The PKM gene encodes the enzyme pyruvate kinase M1/2, which plays a pivotal role in glycolysis, a fundamental metabolic pathway for energy production. This gene undergoes alternative splicing to produce two isoforms: PKM1 and PKM2. PKM1 is primarily expressed in tissues with high energy demands, such as the brain and muscle, while PKM2 is prevalent in proliferating cells, including embryonic and cancer cells (Li2024The; Taniguchi2018OrganSpecific). As a kinase, PKM2 is particularly notable for its ability to exist in multiple oligomeric states, which allows it to perform diverse functions beyond glycolysis, including roles in cellular metabolism, growth, and cancer cell proliferation (Lee2021Multiple). PKM2's activity is intricately regulated by post-translational modifications and interactions with various proteins and nucleic acids, underscoring its significance in both normal cellular processes and pathological conditions such as cancer (Verbrugge2020PKM2; Lee2021Multiple).

## Structure
Pyruvate kinase M1/2 (PKM) is an enzyme involved in glycolysis, existing in two isoforms, PKM1 and PKM2, due to alternative splicing of the PKM gene. The structural difference between these isoforms arises from the inclusion of exon 9 in PKM1 and exon 10 in PKM2, affecting amino acids 378-434 (Lee2021Multiple). PKM1 is predominantly expressed in tissues with high energy demands, such as the brain and muscle, while PKM2 is prevalent in proliferating cells, including embryonic and cancer cells (Li2024The; Taniguchi2018OrganSpecific).

PKM2 can exist in monomeric, dimeric, and tetrameric forms, with the tetramer being the most enzymatically active. Its activity is modulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation, which influence its stability, activity, and cellular localization (Lee2021Multiple). Phosphorylation at specific residues, such as Tyr105 and Ser37, affects PKM2's activity and nuclear translocation, while acetylation at Lys305 and Lys433 alters its enzyme activity and degradation (Lee2021Multiple).

PKM2's ability to form different oligomeric states and undergo various modifications allows it to play diverse roles in cellular metabolism and regulation, particularly in cancer cell proliferation and metabolism (Lee2021Multiple).

## Function
The PKM gene encodes two isoforms, PKM1 and PKM2, which are involved in glycolysis, a critical metabolic pathway for energy production. PKM2, in particular, plays a significant role in the metabolism of proliferating cells, including muscle and endothelial cells. In muscle cells, PKM2 is predominantly expressed in fast-twitch fibers, which are more prone to hypertrophy. It is involved in redirecting glycolytic flux towards biosynthetic pathways, contributing to muscle growth and hypertrophy, especially in response to resistance exercise (Verbrugge2020PKM2). PKM2 can translocate to the nucleus, where it has regulatory functions beyond glycolysis, contributing to the metabolic reprogramming necessary for muscle growth (Verbrugge2020PKM2).

In endothelial cells, PKM2 is crucial for maintaining cellular growth and homeostasis. It limits glucose oxidation, affecting mitochondrial substrate utilization and supporting the growth and epigenetic state of these cells. The loss of PKM2 in endothelial cells leads to impaired proliferation and migration, highlighting its role in cellular metabolism and growth (Stone2018Loss). PKM2's activity is regulated by allosteric effectors and post-translational modifications, influencing its role in cellular metabolism and energy production (Verbrugge2020PKM2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PKM gene, which encodes pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. PKM2 is frequently overexpressed in various cancers, including lung, liver, glioma, and kidney cancers, where it is associated with tumor proliferation, metastasis, and invasion (Wong2015PKM2; Zhang2019PKM2). High levels of PKM2 expression often correlate with poor prognosis in several cancer types, such as signet ring cell gastric cancer and esophageal squamous cell cancer (Wong2015PKM2).

Specific mutations in PKM2, such as H391Y and R399E, are linked to cancer metabolism by promoting nuclear translocation and enhancing transcriptional activity of factors like HIF1α, which are involved in cancer progression (Chen2019Mutations). These mutations also confer a proliferative advantage to tumor cells by reducing allosteric regulation and increasing interaction with oncogenic proteins like KDM8 (Chen2019Mutations).

PKM2's role in cancer metabolism is further highlighted by its involvement in the Warburg effect, a metabolic shift favoring glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation, which supports rapid cell proliferation (Wong2015PKM2). Therapeutic strategies targeting PKM2, such as small molecule inhibitors, are being explored to suppress tumor growth by altering its glycolytic activity (Wong2015PKM2; Zhang2019PKM2).

## Interactions
Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular metabolism and cancer biology. PKM2 forms heterocomplexes with PKM1, which may stabilize the active tetramer conformation of the enzyme, potentially increasing its activity in cancer cells (Anastasiou2012Pyruvate). It also interacts with hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α), enhancing its transcriptional activity independently of its catalytic function, a role not shared by PKM1 (Luo2011Pyruvate). PKM2's interaction with HIF-1α is mediated by specific amino acid residues encoded by exon 10, which are absent in PKM1 (Luo2011Pyruvate).

PKM2 also interacts with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R), suppressing Ca2+ release activity, and its disruption can lead to increased Ca2+ signals and apoptosis (Lemos2023The). In cancer cells, PKM2 interacts with proteins like MUC-1 and PIAS3, which enhance its enzyme activity and promote glycolysis (Zhang2019PKM2). PKM2 can also bind to long non-coding RNA GACAT2, influencing mitochondrial function and energy metabolism (Li2022LncRNA). These interactions highlight PKM2's multifaceted role in cellular processes, particularly in cancer cell metabolism and proliferation.
