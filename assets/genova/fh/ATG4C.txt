# ATG4C

## Overview
ATG4C is a gene that encodes the protein autophagy related 4C cysteine peptidase, which is a member of the cysteine protease family. This protein plays a pivotal role in the autophagy process, particularly in the cleavage and delipidation of ATG8 family proteins, such as LC3, which are essential for autophagosome formation and maturation (Zhang2016Unraveling). While ATG4C is not indispensable for autophagy under normal physiological conditions, it becomes crucial during stress conditions, such as prolonged starvation, where it facilitates an appropriate autophagic response (Mariño2007Tissuespecific). The gene is expressed across various human tissues, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to cellular stress (Mariño2007Tissuespecific). Additionally, ATG4C has been implicated in several diseases, including Kashin-Beck disease and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Fraiberg2020Genetic; Xia2020The).

## Function
ATG4C is a cysteine protease involved in the autophagy process, specifically in the cleavage and delipidation of ATG8 family proteins, such as LC3, which are crucial for autophagosome formation. This process is essential for the recycling of cellular components, maintaining cellular homeostasis, and facilitating cellular responses to stress conditions (Zhang2016Unraveling). ATG4C is active in the cytoplasm, where it participates in the lipidation and delipidation of LC3, a critical step in autophagosome maturation (Zhang2016Unraveling).

In healthy human cells, ATG4C is part of a ubiquitin-like modification system necessary for the execution of autophagy, a process that degrades damaged proteins and organelles, thus protecting against cellular damage and maintaining tissue integrity (Wu2017Genetic; Mariño2007Tissuespecific). Although ATG4C is not essential for autophagy under normal conditions, it plays a significant role under stress conditions, such as prolonged starvation, where it is necessary for a proper autophagic response (Zhang2016Unraveling; Mariño2007Tissuespecific). The gene is widely expressed in human tissues, indicating its functional importance in autophagy and cellular homeostasis (Mariño2007Tissuespecific).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ATG4C gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly those involving autophagy dysfunction. Kashin-Beck disease (KBD), a chronic joint disorder characterized by cartilage degeneration and chondrocytic necrosis, has been linked to dysfunctional autophagy. Variants in the ATG4C gene, specifically rs11208030, rs4409690, rs12097658, and rs6587988, are associated with lower mRNA and protein levels of ATG4C in KBD chondrocytes, implicating ATG4C in the disease's pathogenesis (Fraiberg2020Genetic; Wu2017Genetic; van2018Genetic).

In cancer, ATG4C has been identified as having a potential tumor suppressor role. Its expression is significantly upregulated in advanced grades of glioma, and knockdown of ATG4C has been shown to repress temozolomide resistance, indicating its involvement in glioma progression (Xia2020The). Additionally, miR-376b, a microRNA, regulates autophagy by targeting ATG4C, and its overexpression leads to decreased ATG4C protein levels, suggesting a role in cancer and other autophagy-related conditions (Korkmaz2012miR376b).

ATG4C is also implicated in cardiovascular conditions, as the SNP rs6587988 is correlated with total cholesterol and triglycerides (Xia2020The). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ATG4C in various diseases.

## Interactions
ATG4C interacts with LC3B and GABARAP proteins, although these interactions are weaker compared to those of ATG4B. This is partly due to the presence of a hydrophobic valine in the LIR motif of ATG4C, which replaces a critical acidic residue found in ATG4B, affecting its binding affinity (Skytte2017ATG4B). The interactions of ATG4C with LC3C and GABARAP-L2 are also influenced by phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of LC3C and GABARAP-L2 impairs their cleavage by ATG4C due to reduced binding affinity, as the introduction of negative charges from phosphorylation disrupts the binding interface (Herhaus2019TBK1‐mediated).

ATG4C is targeted by miR-376b, which regulates autophagy by decreasing the mRNA and protein levels of ATG4C. This interaction is crucial for modulating autophagy, particularly under conditions of starvation and mTOR inhibition (Korkmaz2012miR376b). ATG4C is also involved in the delipidation of mammalian Atg8-family proteins, primarily acting on membrane-associated lipidated proteins (Kauffman2018Delipidation). Despite its weaker protease activity compared to other ATG4 family members, ATG4C can complement yeast Atg4 in autophagy, indicating its evolutionary conservation and functional significance (Maruyama2017Autophagyregulating).
