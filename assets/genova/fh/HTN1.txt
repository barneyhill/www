# HTN1

## Overview
The HTN1 gene encodes histatin 1, a histidine-rich peptide predominantly found in human saliva. Histatin 1 is categorized as an antimicrobial peptide, playing a crucial role in oral health by exhibiting antimicrobial properties and promoting wound healing. The peptide's structure is characterized by a high histidine content, which contributes to its functional versatility, including its ability to bind to hydroxyapatite and interact with various cellular proteins (Hof2012Histatins:; Melino2013Histatins:). Histatin 1 is involved in several cellular processes, such as enhancing mitochondrial bioenergetics and promoting cell migration and adhesion, primarily through its interaction with the Sigma-2 receptor/Transmembrane Protein 97 (TMEM97) (Ma2022GPCRendocytosisERK; Son2021Histatin‐1). These interactions underscore its significance in maintaining cellular energy metabolism and facilitating tissue repair, highlighting its potential therapeutic applications in oral and systemic health (Son2021Histatin‐1; Bikker2023Increased).

## Structure
Histatin 1, encoded by the HTN1 gene, is a histidine-rich peptide found in human saliva. Its primary structure is characterized by a sequence of amino acids rich in histidine, which contributes to its functional properties (Hof2012Histatins:). The secondary structure of histatin 1 is mostly disordered, but it can induce more α-helical structures upon binding to certain proteins, such as TMEM97 (Son2021Histatin‐1). 

Histatin 1 contains specific domains that contribute to its biological activities. The N-terminal domain is associated with antimicrobial activity, while the C-terminal domain is involved in wound healing (Melino2013Histatins:). The peptide also features a unique motif that stimulates epithelial cell migration, which is distinct from the antimicrobial motifs found in other histatins (Hof2012Histatins:).

Post-translational modifications of histatin 1 include phosphorylation, which may influence its interaction with other molecules and its functional properties (Melino2013Histatins:). The protein's ability to bind to hydroxyapatite is attributed to its negatively charged C-terminus, which contains a phosphoserine residue (Hof2012Histatins:).

## Function
Histatin 1 (Hst1) is a salivary protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in promoting cell spreading, migration, and metabolic activity by targeting and activating mitochondria. Hst1 enhances mitochondrial bioenergetics, increasing both routine and maximal mitochondrial respiration, and promotes ATP production, which is crucial for cell energy metabolism (Ma2022GPCRendocytosisERK; Bikker2023Increased).

Hst1 interacts with early endosomes for intracellular trafficking, avoiding late endosomes and lysosomes, suggesting a 'kiss and run' interaction with mitochondria. This interaction is mediated by Rab5, which is essential for Hst1's intracellular targeting to mitochondria (Ma2022GPCRendocytosisERK). The protein also enhances the co-localization of mitochondria and the cytoskeleton, promoting filopodia formation and elongation, which are essential for cell spreading and adhesion (Bikker2023Increased).

Hst1 is an endogenous ligand for the Sigma-2 receptor (S2R)/Transmembrane Protein 97 (TMEM97), which is involved in cellular processes such as migration and energy metabolism. The interaction with TMEM97 is crucial for Hst1's uptake and mitochondrial targeting, indicating its role in regulating cell metabolic activity (Ma2022GPCRendocytosisERK; Son2021Histatin‐1).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
Histatin 1 (HTN1) is known for its interactions with various proteins, particularly in cellular environments. It interacts with the Sigma-2 receptor, also known as Transmembrane Protein 97 (TMEM97), which is crucial for its cellular uptake and targeting to mitochondria. This interaction enhances mitochondrial energy metabolism by promoting the formation of mitochondria-ER contacts, which are essential for mitochondrial metabolism and calcium signaling (Ma2022GPCRendocytosisERK). The binding of histatin 1 to TMEM97 is specific and direct, inducing secondary structural changes and increasing α-helical structures, which suggests a functional role in physiological conditions (Son2021Histatin‐1). 

Histatin 1 also interacts with the cytoskeleton, binding to actin and significantly increasing F-actin polymerization. This interaction promotes the formation of actin stress fibers and filopodia, which are important for cell spreading and adhesion (Bikker2023Increased). The interaction between histatin 1 and TMEM97 is also implicated in promoting cell migration and wound healing, with TMEM97 knockdown disrupting these processes (Son2021Histatin‐1). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of histatin 1 in cellular dynamics and bioenergetics.
