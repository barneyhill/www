# STAG2

## Overview
STAG2 is a gene that encodes a protein component of the cohesin complex, which is crucial for maintaining sister chromatid cohesion and ensuring accurate chromosome segregation during cell division. The STAG2 protein, categorized as a cohesin complex component, plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including DNA repair, transcriptional regulation, and genome organization. It is primarily located in the nucleus, where it contributes to chromosomal stability and integrity. Mutations in the STAG2 gene have been implicated in several cancers, such as bladder cancer, Ewing sarcoma, and glioblastoma, often leading to chromosomal instability and aneuploidy. These mutations can affect the protein's function and interactions, highlighting its importance in both normal cellular function and disease pathogenesis (Kim2016Intact; Solomon2011Mutational; Surdez2021STAG2).

## Structure
STAG2 is a component of the cohesin complex, which is essential for sister chromatid cohesion and chromosome segregation during cell division. The protein is composed of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the STAG2 gene, forming its primary structure. Its secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which fold into a three-dimensional shape, crucial for its function within the cohesin complex (Kim2016Intact).

STAG2 contains specific domains, such as the stromal antigen domain, which are important for its interaction with other cohesin components. The quaternary structure of STAG2 involves its interaction with other proteins in the cohesin complex, including RAD21, SMC1A, and SMC3. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the cohesin complex (Kim2016Intact).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur in STAG2, potentially affecting its activity and interactions. The protein can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may influence its function and localization within the cell (Kim2016Intact). These structural features and modifications are significant for the role of STAG2 in maintaining chromosomal stability and its implications in cancer pathogenesis.

## Function
The STAG2 gene encodes a subunit of the cohesin complex, which is essential for several critical cellular processes in healthy human cells. This complex plays a pivotal role in sister chromatid cohesion, ensuring that chromatids remain connected after DNA replication and are correctly segregated during cell division, thereby maintaining chromosomal stability and preventing aneuploidy (Kim2016Intact; Solomon2011Mutational). STAG2 is also involved in DNA repair, transcriptional regulation, and genome organization (Schmidt2022Somatic; RomeroPérez2019STAG).

STAG2 is preferentially located at centromeres and is involved in 3D chromosome compartmentalization, contributing to transcriptional regulation by binding to sites devoid of CTCF (RomeroPérez2019STAG). It interacts with the replication machinery, protecting cells against DNA damage and ensuring proper replication fork progression (RomeroPérez2019STAG). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it helps maintain chromosomal integrity during cell division (Kim2016Intact).

Mutations in STAG2 can lead to defects in sister chromatid cohesion and chromosome segregation, contributing to chromosomal instability in cancer cells (Solomon2011Mutational). Despite these potential disruptions, some mutations do not lead to aneuploidy, suggesting additional roles for STAG2 beyond chromosome cohesion (Kim2016Intact).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the STAG2 gene are implicated in various cancers, contributing to chromosomal instability and aneuploidy. In bladder cancer, STAG2 mutations are common, particularly in early-stage non-invasive papillary carcinomas, and are associated with increased disease-free survival in non-muscle invasive cases. However, in invasive urothelial carcinomas, these mutations correlate with increased lymph node metastasis, disease recurrence, and cancer-specific mortality (Solomon2013Frequent). 

In Ewing sarcoma, STAG2 mutations are frequent secondary genetic alterations linked to poor prognosis and metastasis. These mutations lead to loss of function and are often selected during cancer progression, affecting the transcriptional activity of the EWSR1-FLI1 fusion protein, a key driver in this cancer (Surdez2021STAG2; Adane2021STAG2). 

STAG2 mutations are also found in glioblastoma, where they cause chromosomal instability and aneuploidy, contributing to tumorigenesis (Solomon2011Mutational). In myeloid malignancies, such as acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes, STAG2 mutations are associated with higher-risk disease phenotypes (Thota2014Genetic). These mutations are somatic and tumor-specific, leading to aberrant protein localization and altered chromatin association (Solomon2011Mutational).

## Interactions
STAG2 is a component of the cohesin complex, which is essential for chromosome segregation during cell division. It interacts with several cohesin subunits, including SMC1A, SMC3, and RAD21, forming a crucial part of the cohesin ring structure (Kim2016Intact). STAG2 also interacts with regulatory proteins such as WAPL and PDS5A, which are involved in cohesin unloading and chromatin dynamics (Arruda2020Distinct; Cuadrado2022Contribution). 

In the context of DNA replication, STAG2 is necessary for the stability of the replication fork, mediating interactions between cohesin and replication machinery components like PCNA, PolD, and PolE. Its absence disrupts these interactions, leading to replication fork stalling and collapse (Mondal2019A). STAG2 is also required for the acetylation of SMC3, a modification critical for DNA replication (Mondal2019A).

STAG2's interactions extend to chromatin, where it is involved in chromatin looping and transcriptional control. It binds to chromatin at specific sites, often in conjunction with other cohesin components and transcription factors, influencing gene regulation and chromatin architecture (Casa2020Redundant). STAG2 is more dynamic than its counterpart STAG1, associating preferentially with non-CTCF cohesin-binding sites, which are potential sites of cohesin loading or pausing (Cuadrado2022Contribution).
