# ALYREF

## Overview
ALYREF, or Aly/REF export factor, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in the export of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The protein, categorized as an mRNA export adaptor, plays a critical role in the TREX complex, facilitating the interaction between mRNA and the export receptor NXF1, which is essential for mRNA transport through nuclear pore complexes (Shi2017ALYREF). ALYREF is characterized by several domains, including an RNA recognition motif (RRM) and UAP56-interaction domains, which enable its binding to RNA and interaction with other proteins involved in mRNA processing (Gromadzka2016A; Clarke2023CryoEM). The protein's ability to recognize 5-methylcytosine (m5C) modifications in mRNA underscores its role in post-transcriptional regulation (Yang20175methylcytosine). ALYREF's expression is linked to various cancers and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its clinical significance as a potential therapeutic target (Berson2019Drosophila; Yuan2024Identification).

## Structure
ALYREF, also known as Aly/REF export factor, is a protein involved in mRNA export and is characterized by several specific domains and motifs crucial for its function. The protein contains an RNA recognition motif (RRM) located between residues 106-187, which is essential for its interaction with the nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC) composed of NCBP1 and NCBP2 subunits (Gromadzka2016A; Clarke2024CryoEM). The RRM domain exhibits a canonical β1α1β2β3α2β4 topology, forming an α-helical surface and a β-sheet surface that engage in hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions with the CBC (Clarke2023CryoEM).

ALYREF also contains two UAP56-interaction domains (UBM) at the N-terminal (1-15 aa) and C-terminal (237-257 aa) regions, and an NXF1-binding motif (15-37 aa) (Gromadzka2016A). The protein includes two arginine-rich regions (RGG) spanning residues 17-87 and 198-231, which contribute to RNA binding in vitro (Gromadzka2016A). The WxHD motif, located at residues 87-90, is important for interaction with the CBC and is shared with other proteins involved in mRNA export (Gromadzka2016A; Clarke2024CryoEM).

ALYREF's structure is characterized by these motifs and domains, facilitating its role in mRNA processing and export. The protein's interaction with the CBC is mutually exclusive with its interaction with the exon junction complex (EJC), indicating a regulatory mechanism in mRNA processing (Clarke2023CryoEM). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can regulate its function, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. ALYREF may also exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, but specific isoforms are not mentioned in the context.

## Function
ALYREF (Aly/REF export factor) is a crucial protein involved in the export of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in human cells. It functions as a key component of the TREX complex, which is essential for mRNA export. ALYREF acts as an mRNA export adaptor, facilitating the interaction between mRNA and the export receptor NXF1, thereby promoting the transport of mRNA through the nuclear pore complexes (Shi2017ALYREF).

ALYREF primarily binds to the 5′ and 3′ regions of mature mRNAs, with a significant preference for exons over introns. This binding is essential for the processing and export of mRNA, as it helps stabilize the mRNA and facilitates its transport from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Shi2017ALYREF). The protein's interaction with the cap-binding complex (CBC) and the polyA-binding protein PABPN1 is crucial for its recruitment to these regions, indicating its role in mRNA stability and translation regulation (Shi2017ALYREF).

ALYREF also specifically recognizes 5-methylcytosine (m5C) modifications in mRNA, which are important for selective mRNA export. This interaction is regulated by the methyltransferase NSUN2, highlighting ALYREF's role in post-transcriptional regulation and mRNA export (Yang20175methylcytosine).

## Clinical Significance
The ALYREF gene is implicated in various cancers due to its role in mRNA export and regulation. Alterations in ALYREF expression are associated with poor prognosis in several cancer types, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), bladder cancer (BCa), breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and neuroblastoma (NB) (Yuan2024Identification). In gastric cancer, high ALYREF expression correlates with poor prognosis, particularly in microsatellite instability-high (MSI-high) subtypes, and its knockdown inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis (Yuan2024Identification). In bladder cancer, ALYREF promotes glycolysis and tumor growth, with its expression linked to poor overall survival and recurrence-free survival (Wang2021The). ALYREF is also upregulated in urothelial bladder cancer, where it enhances cell proliferation and invasion through m5C-dependent mechanisms (Wang2023m5Cdependent).

In neurodegenerative diseases, ALYREF is upregulated in motor neurons of ALS patients, particularly those with the expanded G4C2 repeat mutation, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for ALS and FTD (Berson2019Drosophila).

## Interactions
ALYREF, a key player in mRNA export, interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids. It binds specifically to RNA, with a preference for exon-exon junctions on mature mRNAs, and is crucial for mRNA export by binding to the 5′ and 3′ regions of mRNA (Shi2017ALYREF). ALYREF forms part of the TREX complex, interacting with components such as THOC proteins and DDX39B (also known as UAP56) through UAP56-binding motifs (UBMs) (Clarke2023CryoEM; Gromadzka2016A). It also interacts with the nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC), consisting of NCBP1 and NCBP2, through its RRM domain (Clarke2023CryoEM).

ALYREF is involved in interactions with the export receptor NXF1-NXT1, facilitating mRNA export through the nuclear pore complex (Clarke2023CryoEM). It also binds to splicing factors like SRSF1 and the exon junction complex (EJC), with the interaction being mutually exclusive with its binding to the CBC (Clarke2023CryoEM). ALYREF interacts with viral proteins such as HSV-1 ICP27 and HVS ORF57, which target its RRM domain, potentially affecting its interaction with the CBC (Clarke2023CryoEM; Tunnicliffe2014Competitive). These interactions highlight ALYREF's multifaceted role in mRNA processing and export.
