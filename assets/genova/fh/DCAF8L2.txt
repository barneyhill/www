# DCAF8L2

## Overview
DCAF8L2 (DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 8 like 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a critical pathway for protein degradation and turnover in eukaryotic cells. The protein encoded by DCAF8L2 functions as an adaptor within the CUL4-DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, facilitating the ubiquitination of specific substrates, which marks them for degradation by the proteasome. This process is essential for maintaining cellular protein homeostasis and regulating various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, DNA repair, and signal transduction. The DCAF8L2 protein is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it plays a crucial role in targeting proteins for ubiquitination, thereby influencing cellular integrity and function (KIM2022Identification; Zou2016Genomewide).

## Function
DCAF8L2 (DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 8 like 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is crucial for regulating protein degradation in cells. This protein functions as an adaptor, linking specific substrates to the CUL4-DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, facilitating the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins. This process is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis and influences several cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, DNA repair, and signal transduction (Zou2016Genomewide).

The DCAF8L2 protein is typically active in the nucleus, where it plays a role in targeting proteins for ubiquitination. This activity is vital for the regulation of various cellular processes, ensuring proper cell function and survival. The involvement of DCAF8L2 in these molecular processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular integrity and function (Zou2016Genomewide).

While specific functional information about DCAF8L2 in healthy cells is limited, its role as part of the ubiquitin-proteasome system suggests it is integral to cellular regulation and homeostasis, potentially impacting organismal outcomes such as development and response to cellular stress (KIM2022Identification).

## Interactions
DCAF8L2, or DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 8 like 2, is known to interact with components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. It is particularly associated with the CUL4-DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This complex plays a crucial role in targeting specific proteins for ubiquitination, marking them for degradation by the proteasome. Through its interaction with the CUL4-DDB1 complex, DCAF8L2 may influence various cellular processes by regulating the stability and turnover of proteins involved in these pathways. The precise mechanisms and the full range of protein interactions involving DCAF8L2 remain subjects of ongoing research, but its association with the ubiquitin-proteasome system suggests a significant role in maintaining cellular protein homeostasis.
