# ZNRF2

## Overview
ZNRF2 is a gene that encodes the protein zinc and ring finger 2, which functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is characterized by a zinc finger-RING finger motif, which is essential for its ubiquitin ligase activity, and it plays a significant role in cellular signaling pathways, particularly in the regulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) (Gu2021ZNRF2; Hoxhaj2012ZNRF2). ZNRF2 is involved in the modulation of the sodium/potassium pump (Na+/K+ ATPase) and interacts with various proteins, including the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) and the Ragulator complex, to facilitate mTORC1 activation in response to amino acids (Hoxhaj2016The). The protein's activity and localization are regulated by post-translational modifications such as N-myristoylation and phosphorylation, which are crucial for its function in maintaining cellular homeostasis and influencing processes like cell growth and proliferation (Hoxhaj2016The).

## Structure
ZNRF2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase characterized by a zinc finger-RING finger motif located in its C-terminal region, which is crucial for its ubiquitin ligase activity (Gu2021ZNRF2). The protein contains a UBZ domain and a RING domain, both of which contribute to its interaction with mTOR, although the UBZ domain alone is not sufficient for binding (Hoxhaj2016The). The RING domain is essential for its interaction with Ubc13, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, indicating its role in protein ubiquitylation (Hoxhaj2012ZNRF2).

ZNRF2 undergoes post-translational modifications, including N-myristoylation, which targets it to intracellular membranes and is crucial for its interaction with the Na+/K+ ATPase α1 subunit (Hoxhaj2012ZNRF2). Phosphorylation at specific serine residues, such as Ser145, is mediated by mTORC1 and is important for its release from membranes and regulation of mTORC1 activity (Hoxhaj2016The). This phosphorylation state influences its membrane binding and function, acting as a feedback mechanism in mTORC1 signaling (Hoxhaj2016The). The protein's interaction with 14-3-3 proteins upon phosphorylation further regulates its localization and function (Hoxhaj2012ZNRF2).

## Function
ZNRF2 encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a crucial role in several cellular processes in human cells. It is involved in the regulation of the sodium/potassium pump (Na+/K+ ATPase) by interacting with its α1 subunit. This interaction is facilitated by ZNRF2's UBZ domain and is crucial for maintaining cellular ion balance. ZNRF2's activity is modulated by N-myristoylation and phosphorylation, which influence its localization and function (Hoxhaj2012ZNRF2).

ZNRF2 is also a significant player in the activation of mTORC1, a key regulator of cell growth and metabolism, in response to amino acids. It interacts with components of the V-ATPase and Ragulator complexes, which are essential for mTORC1 signaling. ZNRF2's role in mTORC1 activation involves maintaining lysosomal acidity and facilitating the translocation of mTORC1 to lysosomes. This process is regulated by phosphorylation at Ser145, which is mediated by mTORC1 and dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase PP6, creating a feedback loop that modulates mTORC1 activity (Hoxhaj2016The).

ZNRF2's functions are critical for cellular homeostasis, affecting processes such as cell proliferation and size, and its activity is tightly regulated by post-translational modifications (Hoxhaj2016The).

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the ZNRF2 gene is primarily linked to its role in cellular signaling pathways, particularly in the activation of mTORC1, which is crucial for cell growth and proliferation. Alterations in ZNRF2 expression or its interactions can have implications for diseases such as cancer. For instance, the phosphorylation of ZNRF2 at Ser145 by mTORC1 is a regulatory mechanism that affects its function in mTORC1 signaling. Mutations or changes in this phosphorylation site can impact mTORC1 activation, potentially influencing cell proliferation and size, which are critical factors in cancer development (Hoxhaj2016The).

In papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), the long non-coding RNA TTN-AS1 has been shown to facilitate tumorigenesis by modulating the miR-153-3p/ZNRF2 axis. High levels of TTN-AS1 correlate with increased ZNRF2 expression, which is associated with the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, promoting cancer progression. This suggests that ZNRF2 may play a role in the oncogenic processes of PTC, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Cui2019Long).

While the clinical significance of ZNRF2 gene mutations and expression alterations is still being explored, its involvement in key signaling pathways suggests it may have broader implications in cancer and possibly other diseases.

## Interactions
ZNRF2, a protein encoded by the human ZNRF2 gene, is involved in several protein interactions that play a crucial role in cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) and the Ragulator complex, which are essential for the activation of mTORC1 by amino acids. This interaction facilitates the translocation of mTORC1 to lysosomes, a critical step for its activation (Hoxhaj2016The). ZNRF2 is also a substrate of mTORC1, and its phosphorylation at Ser145 by mTORC1 promotes its dissociation from membranes, forming a negative feedback loop (Hoxhaj2016The).

ZNRF2 interacts with 14-3-3 proteins upon phosphorylation, which affects its localization and function (Hoxhaj2012ZNRF2). It also binds to the Na+/K+ ATPase α1 subunit, a process dependent on its N-myristoylation and UBZ domains (Hoxhaj2012ZNRF2). Additionally, ZNRF2 interacts with E2 proteins, primarily Ubc13, to form Lys63-ubiquitin linkages, highlighting its role in ubiquitination processes (Hoxhaj2012ZNRF2).

These interactions underscore ZNRF2's involvement in regulating mTORC1 signaling and its broader role in cellular homeostasis and response to stress conditions.
