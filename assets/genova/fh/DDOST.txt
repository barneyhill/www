# DDOST

## Overview
The DDOST gene encodes the protein OST48, a non-catalytic subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, which is integral to the process of N-linked glycosylation in human cells. This transmembrane protein is primarily located in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, where it facilitates the attachment of glycans to nascent proteins, a critical step for their proper folding and function (Ramírez2019Cryo–electron; Kas2023Functional). OST48 plays a significant role in the maturation and stability of secreted and cell surface proteins, impacting cellular homeostasis and protein quality control (Kas2023Functional). Beyond its fundamental role in glycosylation, DDOST is involved in various cellular processes, including antiviral immune responses and the regulation of extracellular matrix components, such as lysyl oxidase (Tu2022MITA; Kas2023Functional). Mutations or altered expression of DDOST have been implicated in congenital disorders of glycosylation and various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Kas2023Functional; Chang2022DDOST).

## Function
The DDOST gene encodes OST48, a non-catalytic subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, which is essential for N-linked glycosylation in human cells. This process involves the attachment of glycans to specific motifs on proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum, a critical step for the proper folding, stability, and function of secreted and cell surface proteins (Ramírez2019Cryo–electron; Kas2023Functional). OST48 is a transmembrane protein located primarily in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, where it plays a crucial role in the maturation and function of many proteins (Kas2023Functional).

In healthy human cells, DDOST is vital for the N-glycosylation of lysyl oxidase (LOX), an enzyme involved in the cross-linking of collagen and elastin in the extracellular matrix. Proper glycosylation of LOX is necessary for its function in stabilizing the extracellular matrix, which is important for maintaining tissue integrity (Kas2023Functional). The depletion of DDOST leads to impaired LOX N-glycosylation and reduced cell proliferation, highlighting its role in cell viability and proliferation (Kas2023Functional). The OST complex, including OST48, is also involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis and protein quality control (Kas2023Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DDOST gene are associated with congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), a group of rare genetic disorders characterized by abnormal N-glycosylation of proteins. These disorders present with a wide range of clinical manifestations, including significant neurological components, developmental delays, and abnormal glycosylation of serum transferrin. CDG is divided into two subtypes: CDG-I, which involves altered assembly or transfer of lipid-linked oligosaccharides, and CDG-II, which involves defects in processing protein-attached oligosaccharides. The DDOST gene encodes the OST48 subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, which is crucial for N-linked glycosylation, affecting protein structure and function (Kas2023Functional).

Alterations in DDOST expression levels have been linked to various cancers. High DDOST expression is associated with poor prognosis in gliomas, a type of brain tumor, and is correlated with worse molecular features such as IDH wild type and 1p19q non-codel, which predict poor survival. DDOST is also linked to the tumor microenvironment, influencing immune cell infiltration and contributing to an immunosuppressive environment, which affects the effectiveness of immunotherapy in gliomas (Chang2022DDOST). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), high DDOST expression correlates with poorer overall and disease-specific survival, and is associated with immune infiltration patterns that may exacerbate liver injury (Zhu2022Prognostic).

## Interactions
DDOST, a non-catalytic subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, plays a significant role in protein interactions, particularly in the context of antiviral immune responses. DDOST interacts with MITA (also known as STING) at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through their transmembrane domains. This interaction is crucial for MITA's function in antiviral signaling, as it facilitates MITA trafficking from the ER to perinuclear vesicles upon viral infection, enhancing the antiviral immune response (Tu2022MITA). Co-immunoprecipitation assays have shown that DDOST interacts with MITA but not with other proteins such as cGAS, TBK1, IRF3, TRAF3, or TRAF6 (Tu2022MITA).

DDOST is also involved in the N-glycosylation of MITA, a process essential for MITA's oligomerization and activation during viral infections. This glycosylation occurs at specific residues on MITA and is necessary for its interaction with cGAMP, which is crucial for the full activation of the immune response (Tu2022MITA). The interaction between DDOST and MITA is enhanced upon HSV-1 infection, highlighting the importance of DDOST in the OST complex for effective antiviral signaling through MITA (Tu2022MITA).
