# CD38

## Overview
CD38 is a gene that encodes a multifunctional type II transmembrane glycoprotein, which plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes. The CD38 protein is primarily involved in the metabolism of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), catalyzing its conversion into cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR), a crucial second messenger in calcium signaling pathways (Partida-Sánchez2001Cyclic; Malavasi2008Evolution). This protein is expressed on the surface of numerous immune cells, including T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells, where it modulates immune responses and cell signaling (Malavasi2008Evolution). Beyond its enzymatic functions, CD38 acts as an accessory receptor, influencing processes such as insulin secretion and chemotaxis, which are vital for maintaining physiological functions and immune responses (Partida-Sánchez2001Cyclic; Malavasi2008Evolution). CD38's interactions with other proteins, such as CD31, further underscore its role in immune cell adhesion and migration, making it a significant target in therapeutic interventions for diseases like chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma (Lee2021Crystal; Deaglio2009CD38CD31).

## Structure
CD38 is a type II glycosylated membrane protein with a single transmembrane segment near its N-terminus. It is composed of 300 amino acids and has a short 20-amino acid N-terminal cytoplasmic tail and a long 256-amino acid extracellular domain (lee2006structure; Lee2021Crystal). The protein's secondary structure includes β-structures mainly in the C-domain and helices in the N-domain (lee2006structure). The tertiary structure of CD38 forms a globular shape, with the crystal structure revealing it as a head-to-tail dimer, indicating its quaternary structure (lee2006structure). 

CD38 contains a conserved nine-residue motif, TLEDTLLGY, and conserved cysteine positions, with all twelve cysteines paired as disulfides, except one pair not conserved with Aplysia cyclase (lee2006structure). The protein's active site is characterized by an abundance of acidic residues, such as Glu146 and Asp155, which are critical for its enzymatic function (lee2006structure). CD38 is subject to glycosylation, a common post-translational modification for membrane proteins (lee2006structure). The protein can function in different membrane orientations, either as a type II or type III membrane protein, depending on its orientation (Piedra-Quintero2020CD38:).

## Function
The CD38 gene encodes a multifunctional enzyme that plays a significant role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. CD38 is primarily involved in the metabolism of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), catalyzing its conversion into cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR), a second messenger crucial for calcium signaling. This process is essential for intracellular calcium release and regulation, impacting cell proliferation, apoptosis, and immune responses (Partida-Sánchez2001Cyclic; Malavasi2008Evolution).

CD38 is expressed on the surface of many immune cells, including T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells, where it modulates immune responses and cell signaling. It is involved in the intracellular transduction of signals and is associated with supramolecular signaling complexes, influencing cytokine expression and calcium influx (Malavasi2008Evolution). CD38 also plays a role in the regulation of mitochondrial function and NAD levels, affecting cellular metabolism and energy homeostasis (Camacho-Pereira2016CD38).

In addition to its enzymatic activities, CD38 functions as an accessory receptor, influencing processes such as insulin secretion in pancreatic islets and chemotaxis in neutrophils, which are critical for maintaining normal physiological functions and immune responses (Partida-Sánchez2001Cyclic; Malavasi2008Evolution).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in CD38 expression are linked to several diseases and conditions. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), elevated CD38 expression is associated with adverse prognostic factors, including advanced disease stage, high-risk cytogenetics, and poorer response to therapy. CD38 functions as a receptor on leukemic cells, interacting with its ligand CD31 and mediating signals through Zap70, contributing to CLL pathogenesis (Deaglio2012CD38; Burgler2015Role). A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in CD38 is an independent risk factor for transformation to Richter syndrome, a highly aggressive form of CLL (Deaglio2012CD38).

In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), high CD38 expression is an independent adverse prognostic factor, associated with worse progression-free and overall survival (Wada2021CD38). In solid tumors, CD38 expression contributes to an immunosuppressive microenvironment, affecting tumor-infiltrating T cells and promoting tumor growth. Targeting CD38 has shown potential in reversing immunosuppression and enhancing anti-tumor immune responses, particularly when combined with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade (Ng2020Immunohistochemical; Konen2019The). In hepatocellular carcinoma, higher CD38 expression is linked to improved response to immunotherapy, suggesting its role as a predictive biomarker (Ng2020Immunohistochemical).

## Interactions
CD38 is a multifunctional protein that engages in various interactions with other proteins, influencing immune responses and cellular processes. It forms lateral associations with membrane proteins such as CD16 in natural killer (NK) cells, the T cell receptor (TCR)/CD3 complex and CD4 in T cells, and the B cell co-receptor complex (CD19/CD81) in B lymphocytes, suggesting a role in cell signaling (Glaría2020Roles). CD38 also interacts with CD31, a major endothelial adhesion molecule, facilitating immune cell adhesion and transmigration across the endothelium (Piedra-Quintero2020CD38:).

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), CD38 binds to CD31, activating genetic pathways that promote cell proliferation and migration (Deaglio2009CD38CD31). This interaction is significant in the context of CLL, where CD38 expression is a negative prognostic marker (Deaglio2009CD38CD31). CD38 also associates with chaperone proteins such as Hsp70, Hsp90, and CCTs, which regulate its folding and degradation (Wu2019A).

In the context of multiple myeloma, CD38 is targeted by therapeutic antibodies like daratumumab, which binds to specific regions on CD38, inducing structural changes and anti-tumor effects (Lee2021Crystal). These interactions highlight CD38's role in immune modulation and its potential as a therapeutic target.
