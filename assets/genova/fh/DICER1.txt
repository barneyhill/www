# DICER1

## Overview
DICER1 is a gene that encodes the protein dicer 1, ribonuclease III, a critical enzyme in the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. This protein is categorized as a ribonuclease III enzyme and is essential for the biogenesis of microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which are key regulators of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Dicer 1 processes precursor miRNAs into mature miRNAs, facilitating their role in gene silencing by targeting specific mRNA transcripts for degradation or translational repression (Theotoki2020Dicing; Thunders2020Gene). The DICER1 gene is highly conserved across species, underscoring its fundamental role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and normal physiological processes, including development and genome defense (Thunders2020Gene). Mutations in DICER1 are linked to a hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in tumorigenesis (schultz2018dicer1; Kock2019Ten).

## Structure
The DICER1 protein is a ribonuclease III enzyme essential for the processing of microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Its primary structure includes several key domains: a helicase domain, a PAZ domain, two RNase III domains (IIIa and IIIb), and a double-stranded RNA-binding domain (dsRBD) (Kock2019Ten; Thunders2020Gene). The RNase III domains are particularly crucial for its function, with RNase IIIa responsible for cleaving the 3p miRNA strand and RNase IIIb for the 5p miRNA strand (Vedanayagam2019Cancerassociated).

The secondary structure of DICER1 features alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the stability and function of its domains. The tertiary structure involves the spatial arrangement of these domains, allowing for the precise cleavage of precursor miRNAs into mature miRNAs (Vedanayagam2019Cancerassociated). The quaternary structure of DICER1 includes its dimerization, which is important for its enzymatic activity (Thunders2020Gene).

Mutations in the RNase III domains, particularly the RNase IIIb domain, can disrupt miRNA processing, leading to various diseases, including cancer (Vedanayagam2019Cancerassociated). These mutations often affect the protein's ability to process miRNA-5p species, resulting in an imbalance of miRNA types (Wu2015Functional).

## Function
DICER1 is a highly conserved RNaseIII endoribonuclease that plays a critical role in the biogenesis of microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which are essential for post-transcriptional gene silencing. This process regulates more than half of human protein-coding genes by targeting and modulating complementary RNA transcripts (Thunders2020Gene). DICER1 is responsible for cleaving precursor miRNAs to produce mature miRNAs and siRNAs, which act as guide molecules in RNA interference (RNAi), targeting specific mRNAs for degradation or translational repression (Theotoki2020Dicing; Thunders2020Gene).

In healthy human cells, DICER1 is crucial for maintaining normal physiological processes, including neurogenesis, embryonic development, chromatin modification, and genome defense against viruses and transposons (Thunders2020Gene). It is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it processes pre-miRNAs into mature miRNAs, but also has roles in the nucleus, such as transcriptional silencing and DNA damage response (Theotoki2020Dicing). DICER1's function is vital for cellular differentiation, tumor progression, and the resolution of DNA damage, highlighting its importance in preventing the dysregulation of miRNAs, which can lead to various diseases, including cancer (Thunders2020Gene).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DICER1 gene are associated with a hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome known as DICER1 syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by an increased risk of developing various tumors, particularly in children and young adults. Notable conditions linked to DICER1 mutations include pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB), ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors, cystic nephroma, and multinodular goiter. Individuals with these mutations may also develop thyroid cancer, ciliary body medulloepithelioma, and pituitary blastoma (schultz2018dicer1; Kock2019Ten).

DICER1 mutations are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with decreased penetrance, meaning not all carriers will exhibit symptoms. The prevalence of these mutations in the general population is estimated to be between 1 in 2,529 and 1 in 10,600 individuals (schultz2018dicer1). The mutations can lead to a range of neoplastic and dysplastic lesions, with some conditions manifesting in early childhood, such as PPB and cystic nephroma (Foulkes2011Extending).

The DICER1 gene's role in microRNA processing is crucial for regulating gene expression. Alterations in its expression or function can contribute to tumor development and progression, as seen in the diverse range of conditions associated with DICER1 syndrome (Slade2011DICER1).

## Interactions
DICER1 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in RNA interference and other cellular processes. It forms a complex with TRBP (TAR RNA-binding protein) and Argonaute 2 (Ago2), which is essential for miRNA biogenesis and gene silencing. This complex facilitates the recruitment of Ago2 to siRNA bound by Dicer, stabilizing Dicer and enhancing miRNA processing (Chendrimada2005TRBP). DICER1 also interacts with the nuclear pore complex protein NUP153, which is involved in its nuclear localization, suggesting a role in nucleocytoplasmic transport (Ando2011Nuclear).

In Drosophila, Dicer-1 forms complexes with Loquacious (Loqs) and AGO1, which are involved in the processing of pre-miRNAs into mature miRNAs (Saito2005Processing). DICER1's interaction with TRBP is mediated through hydrophobic interactions, which enhance the stability of Dicer by masking the hydrophobic patch on the Dicer PBD domain (Paturi2021A). Additionally, DICER1 forms a heterodimer with Adenosine Deaminase RNA Specific (ADAR), targeting the degradation of Alu RNAs to maintain mitochondrial integrity (Thunders2020Gene). These interactions highlight DICER1's multifaceted role in RNA processing and cellular regulation.
