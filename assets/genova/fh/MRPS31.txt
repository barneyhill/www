# MRPS31

## Overview
MRPS31 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S31, which is a component of the small 28S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein plays a pivotal role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by aiding in the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into proteins essential for mitochondrial function and cellular energy production (He2012Human). As a mitochondrial ribosomal protein, MRPS31 is integral to the assembly and function of the mitoribosome complex, which is crucial for mitochondrial translation and energy metabolism (Cheong2020Expression). Beyond its primary role in mitochondrial protein synthesis, MRPS31 is involved in various protein-protein interactions, suggesting additional functions outside the mitochondria (Revathi2021Expression). The gene's expression and function have significant implications in cancer biology, where it is associated with tumorigenic processes and poor clinical outcomes in several cancer types, including hepatocellular carcinoma and breast cancer (Min2021MRPS31; Revathi2021Expression).

## Function
MRPS31 is a mitochondrial ribosomal protein that is part of the small 28S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. It plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into functional proteins, which is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production in cells (He2012Human). MRPS31 is active within the mitochondria, contributing to cellular respiration and overall energy metabolism. The protein is involved in the assembly and function of the mitoribosome complex, which is crucial for mitochondrial translation (Cheong2020Expression).

MRPS31 interacts with other proteins within the mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit, such as C4orf14, which is involved in the biogenesis of this subunit. This interaction suggests that MRPS31 may play a role in mitochondrial protein synthesis or mtRNA metabolism (He2012Human). The proper functioning of MRPS31 is vital for the assembly of the mitochondrial ribosome and the translation of mitochondrial-encoded proteins, which are necessary for the electron transport chain and ATP production. Disruptions in MRPS31 function can potentially lead to impaired mitochondrial activity and associated metabolic disorders.

## Clinical Significance
MRPS31 is implicated in various cancers due to its role in mitochondrial function and cellular processes. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), MRPS31 loss is associated with mitochondrial deregulation, leading to aggressive cancer phenotypes and poor clinical outcomes. The loss of MRPS31 results in mitoribosomal deficiency and defects in mitochondrial bioenergetics, contributing to increased invasiveness of hepatoma cells (Min2021MRPS31). MRPS31 loss is linked to the upregulation of genes like MMP7 and COL1A1, which enhance cell invasiveness, and is considered a poor survival marker in HCC (Min2021MRPS31).

In breast cancer, MRPS31 is overexpressed and interacts with proteins involved in cancer-related pathways, suggesting its role in tumorigenic processes (Revathi2021Expression). Similarly, in ovarian cancer, MRPS31 expression correlates with poor survival outcomes, indicating its involvement in metastasis and tumor recurrence (Bacon2024Mitochondrial).

MRPS31 is also involved in a gene fusion with SUGT1 in colorectal cancer, which may serve as a biomarker for early cancer detection (Panza2020Transcriptome; Bao2022Potential). These findings highlight MRPS31's potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in various cancers.

## Interactions
MRPS31 is involved in various protein-protein interactions that suggest roles beyond its primary function in mitochondrial protein synthesis. It interacts with several proteins, including GHDC, SPATA17, CBX2, HSPA1L, HSPA8, HSPA2, HSPA1A, LRBA, MRPS10, BCKDHB, AXIN1, ZFHX3, ZHFX4, NPAS2, RGL3, and LOXL1, as identified through GST pull-down assays. These interactions indicate potential extramitochondrial functions for MRPS31, possibly involving protein-protein interactions outside the mitochondria (Revathi2021Expression).

In the context of cancer, MRPS31 has been shown to interact with ACADSB, a non-mitoribosomal protein that co-localizes to mitochondria, and is involved in gene expression modules related to cancer pathways. This interaction is particularly significant in breast cancer, where MRPS31 is overexpressed and associated with pathways involving Carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) and NPAS2, both of which play roles in breast cancer (Revathi2021Expression).

MRPS31 also interacts with MRPS39, a neighboring protein in the mitoribosome, affecting the integrity of the mitoribosome complex. The knockdown of MRPS31 leads to decreased protein levels of MRPS39, highlighting the importance of their interaction for maintaining mitoribosome activity (Min2021MRPS31).
