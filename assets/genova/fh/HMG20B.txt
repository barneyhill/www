# HMG20B

## Overview
HMG20B is a gene that encodes the high mobility group protein 20B, a non-histone chromosomal protein involved in various cellular processes, including chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. The protein is characterized by its high mobility group (HMG) domain, which facilitates non-sequence specific DNA binding, and a kinesin-like coiled-coil domain that aids in protein complex assembly. HMG20B plays a critical role in cytokinesis by interacting with the BRCA2 tumor suppressor, specifically binding to the BRC5 repeat, which is essential for the abscission step of cell division. Additionally, HMG20B is a component of the CoREST repressor complex, contributing to transcriptional repression and erythroid differentiation. Mutations in HMG20B, such as the A247P substitution, have been linked to carcinogenesis, particularly in lung cancer, by disrupting its interaction with BRCA2 and impairing cytokinesis (Esteghamat2011The; Lee2014A). The gene's involvement in cancer and its potential as a therapeutic target are areas of active research (Alyhya2021Pharmacological).

## Structure
The HMG20B protein is characterized by several structural domains that are crucial for its function. It contains a high mobility group (HMG) domain at the N-terminus, spanning amino acids 69-139, which is involved in non-sequence specific DNA binding (Lee2014A). The protein also features a kinesin-like coiled-coil (KLCC) domain, initially predicted to span amino acids 238-305, but more recent analyses suggest a more extensive coiled-coil domain extending across amino acids 114-143 and 192-262. This domain forms a bundle of alpha-helices, providing interfaces for the dynamic assembly of protein complexes (Lee2014A).

The C-terminal region, spanning residues 173-317, is essential for the protein's localization to cytokinetic structures and its interaction with the BRCA2 tumor suppressor. This region is necessary and sufficient to restore cytokinesis in HMG20B-depleted cells (Lee2014A). A specific mutation, the substitution of Ala247 with Pro, disrupts these activities and is associated with human lung cancer, highlighting the importance of this region in cell division and potential tumor suppression (Lee2014A).

HMG20B is also a subunit of the CoREST repressor complex, involved in chromatin remodeling and gene repression, indicating its role in transcriptional regulation (Esteghamat2011The). The protein's interaction with BRCA2 suggests a quaternary structure involving protein-protein interactions, although specific details are not fully elucidated (Lee2011A).

## Function
HMG20B encodes a high-mobility group protein that plays a crucial role in cytokinesis, the final step of cell division where the cell splits into two daughter cells. The protein is involved in the regulation of cell division by interacting with the BRCA2 tumor suppressor protein, specifically binding to the BRC5 repeat of BRCA2. This interaction is essential for the completion of cytokinesis, separate from BRCA2's role in DNA recombination (Lee2011A). The C-terminal region of HMG20B, spanning residues 173-317, is necessary for its localization to cytokinetic structures and its interaction with BRCA2, which is involved in the abscission step of cytokinesis (Lee2014A).

HMG20B is also part of the CoREST repressor complex, which is involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. It acts as a repressor of erythroid differentiation by modulating the expression of genes involved in this process (Esteghamat2011The). The protein is ubiquitously expressed and is active in the nucleus, where it interacts with other proteins to facilitate its functions in cell cycle progression and differentiation (Lee2014A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the HMG20B gene have been implicated in various cancers, particularly epithelial cancers such as lung carcinomas. A notable mutation, A247P, disrupts the protein's function in cytokinesis by significantly reducing its binding to the BRCA2 tumor suppressor, which is crucial for the abscission step of cell division. This mutation exhibits a dominant-negative effect, leading to cytokinesis failure and an increase in multinucleate cells, even in the presence of wild-type HMG20b. Such disruptions can result in chromosome instability and aneuploidy, contributing to carcinogenesis (Lee2014A).

In liver cancer, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma, HMG20B is overexpressed and interacts with histone deacetylases HDAC1/3. Pharmacological inhibition of HDAC1/3 leads to the downregulation of HMG20B, suggesting its role in cancer cell proliferation and migration. The downregulation of HMG20B upon HDAC inhibition indicates its potential involvement in the epigenetic regulation of liver cancer, although the specific clinical significance requires further exploration (Alyhya2021Pharmacological).

These findings underscore the potential of HMG20B as a target for therapeutic interventions in cancers where its expression or function is altered.

## Interactions
HMG20B interacts with the BRCA2 tumor suppressor protein, specifically binding to the BRC5 repeat of BRCA2. This interaction is crucial for the completion of cytokinesis, the final step of cell division. The BRC5 repeat binds strongly to HMG20B, while the BRC4 repeat of BRCA2 binds to RAD51, indicating distinct roles for these repeats in cellular processes (Lee2011A). The C-terminal region of HMG20B, spanning residues 173-317, is essential for its interaction with BRCA2 and its localization to cytokinetic structures (Lee2014A).

A cancer-associated mutation, A247P, in HMG20B disrupts its interaction with BRCA2 and impairs cytokinesis, suggesting a mechanism by which mutations in HMG20B can contribute to carcinogenesis (Lee2014A). HMG20B is also a component of the CoREST complex, which plays a role in transcriptional repression during erythroid differentiation. It interacts with the transcriptional repressor Gfi1b and is involved in regulating gene expression in erythroid progenitors (Esteghamat2011The).
