# TIGIT

## Overview
TIGIT, or T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in immune regulation. The TIGIT protein functions as an immune checkpoint receptor, primarily expressed on T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells. It plays a critical role in modulating immune responses by interacting with ligands such as CD155, CD112, and CD113, which are part of the nectin and NECL family. Through these interactions, TIGIT transmits inhibitory signals that downregulate T cell receptor (TCR) activation pathways, thereby reducing T cell proliferation and cytokine production. This mechanism is essential for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing autoimmunity (Harjunpää2019TIGIT; Joller2011Cutting). The TIGIT gene is located on human chromosome 3q13.31 and is subject to alternative splicing, which may influence its functional interactions (Annese2022Update). The protein's structure, including its immunoglobulin variable (IgV) domain and cytoplasmic tail motifs, facilitates its role in immune regulation by forming heterotetrameric assemblies with its ligands (Zhang2024Targeting; Deuss2017Recognition).

## Structure
TIGIT is a transmembrane protein composed of 244 amino acids, located on human chromosome 3q13.31. Its structure includes an extracellular immunoglobulin variable (IgV) domain, a type I transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail containing an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) and an immunoglobulin tyrosine tail (ITT)-like motif (Bolm2022Gene; Zhang2024Targeting). The IgV domain is crucial for binding to ligands such as CD155, CD112, and CD113, facilitating a 'lock and key' interaction (Bolm2022Gene; Zhang2024Targeting). 

The ITIM and ITT-like motifs in the cytoplasmic tail are involved in inhibitory signaling. The ITT-like motif, characterized by YxN consensus residues, recruits cytosolic adapters like Grb2 and SHIP1 upon phosphorylation, which mediates negative signaling and suppresses NK cell function (Liu2012Recruitment). 

TIGIT has two alternatively spliced isoforms in humans, which may influence its function and interaction with ligands (Annese2022Update). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in its signaling capabilities (Liu2012Recruitment). The protein's structure allows it to form heterotetrameric assemblies with its ligands, crucial for its role in immune regulation (Deuss2017Recognition).

## Function
TIGIT (T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains) is an immune checkpoint receptor that plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses in healthy human cells. It is expressed on various immune cells, including T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells, and primarily functions by interacting with its main ligand, CD155, as well as CD112 and CD113, which are part of the nectin and NECL family (Harjunpää2019TIGIT). This interaction inhibits effector T cells and NK cells through both cell-extrinsic and cell-intrinsic mechanisms, promoting immune tolerance and preventing autoimmunity (Harjunpää2019TIGIT).

TIGIT engagement leads to the downregulation of T cell receptor (TCR) activation pathways, inhibiting T cell proliferation and cytokine production, such as IFNγ, IL-13, IL-9, and IL-17, by reducing the expression of transcription factors specific to Th1, Th2, Th9, and Th17 cells (Lozano2012The; Joller2011Cutting). It also upregulates cytokine receptors associated with T cell maintenance and antiapoptotic molecules, promoting T cell survival (Joller2011Cutting). TIGIT's inhibitory function is crucial in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive immune responses and autoimmunity (Joller2011Cutting).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the TIGIT gene are associated with various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and autoimmune disorders. In cancer, TIGIT is often upregulated in T and NK cells, contributing to immune evasion by tumors. High TIGIT expression is linked to poor prognosis in several cancers, including follicular lymphoma, lung, urologic, and breast cancers, as well as hematological malignancies like chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (Yeo2021TIGITCD226; Chu2023Coinhibition; Josefsson2018T). The TIGIT/CD155 axis plays a crucial role in impairing T-cell functionality, leading to T cell exhaustion and reduced anti-tumor responses (Chu2023Coinhibition).

In autoimmune diseases, TIGIT acts as a negative regulator of T cell responses. TIGIT knockout mice exhibit increased T cell proliferation and higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, indicating that TIGIT helps control autoimmune reactions. The absence of TIGIT can lead to increased susceptibility to conditions like experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a model for multiple sclerosis (Joller2011Cutting). These findings suggest that TIGIT plays a dual role in both promoting immune evasion in cancer and maintaining immune tolerance in autoimmune diseases.

## Interactions
TIGIT (T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains) is an immune checkpoint receptor that participates in several key interactions with other proteins, primarily within the immune system. TIGIT binds with high affinity to CD155 (also known as PVR), a member of the nectin family, which is expressed on antigen-presenting cells and often upregulated on cancer cells. This interaction leads to the formation of dense nanoclusters at the immune synapse, which are crucial for TIGIT's inhibitory function on T cell activation (Worboys2023TIGIT).

TIGIT also interacts with CD112, another nectin family member, and competes with the costimulatory receptor CD226 for binding to CD155 and CD112. This competition suggests a balance between inhibitory and activating signals in the immune response (Levin2011Vstm3). The interaction with CD155 results in the colocalization of TIGIT with T cell receptor (TCR) clusters, moving towards the central supramolecular activation complex (cSMAC), which is important for its inhibitory role (Worboys2023TIGIT).

Additionally, TIGIT's interaction with CD155 can disrupt CD226-mediated co-stimulation, further contributing to its inhibitory effects on T cells (Worboys2023TIGIT). These interactions highlight TIGIT's role in modulating immune responses, particularly in the context of cancer and autoimmune diseases.
