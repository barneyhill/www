# ZDHHC13

## Overview
ZDHHC13 is a gene that encodes the protein zinc finger DHHC-type palmitoyltransferase 13, a member of the palmitoyl acyltransferase family. This protein is characterized by a conserved DHHC (Asp-His-His-Cys) cysteine-rich domain, which is essential for its enzymatic activity in the post-translational modification process known as S-palmitoylation. As a polytopic membrane protein, ZDHHC13 is primarily localized to the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum, where it plays a crucial role in regulating protein trafficking, stability, and signal transduction. The protein's structure includes an ankyrin repeat domain that facilitates substrate recognition and binding, contributing to its specificity in palmitoylating various proteins involved in critical biological processes such as bone development, skin barrier integrity, and mitochondrial dynamics (Song2014Palmitoyl; Lemonidis2015Identification; Korycka2012Human). Mutations in the ZDHHC13 gene have been associated with several pathological conditions, including alopecia, osteoporosis, and systemic amyloidosis, highlighting its significance in maintaining normal physiological functions (Saleem2010Mice; Chen2017Protein).

## Structure
ZDHHC13, also known as zinc finger DHHC-type palmitoyltransferase 13, is characterized by a conserved DHHC (Asp-His-His-Cys) cysteine-rich domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity in palmitoylation. This domain includes a zinc finger-like structure that coordinates zinc ions, maintaining the protein's structural stability and correct folding during biosynthesis (Zmuda2020Regulatory; Korycka2012Human). 

ZDHHC13 contains an ankyrin repeat (AR) domain at its cytosolic N-terminus, which is involved in substrate recognition and binding. This domain interacts with specific protein motifs, such as the [VI]XXQP motif found in proteins like Huntingtin and SNAP25, facilitating substrate specificity (Lemonidis2015Identification). 

The protein is a polytopic membrane protein with six transmembrane domains, localizing primarily to the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum (Salaun2020Accessory; Korycka2012Human). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a regulatory role in ZDHHC13's function. Phosphorylation at specific sites, like Ser 8, enhances interactions with substrate proteins, influencing receptor signaling and protein stability (Zmuda2020Regulatory). 

The gene may produce multiple isoforms through alternative splicing, potentially affecting the protein's structure and function (Korycka2012Human). However, detailed information on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of ZDHHC13 is not provided in the available context.

## Function
ZDHHC13 encodes a palmitoyl acyltransferase enzyme that plays a crucial role in the post-translational modification of proteins through S-palmitoylation. This process involves the attachment of palmitic acid to cysteine residues, which is essential for regulating protein trafficking, stability, interactions, and signal transduction. ZDHHC13 is active in the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum, where it influences cellular signaling and membrane dynamics (Song2014Palmitoyl).

In bone development, ZDHHC13 is critical for endochondral ossification and bone mass acquisition. It palmitoylates MT1-MMP, a matrix metalloproteinase, affecting its subcellular distribution and regulating the expression of VEGF and osteocalcin, which are vital for bone growth and vascularity (Song2014Palmitoyl). ZDHHC13 deficiency leads to delayed epiphyseal maturation and reduced bone mineral density, highlighting its importance in skeletal development (Song2014Palmitoyl).

ZDHHC13 also plays a role in skin barrier integrity by facilitating the palmitoylation of proteins involved in skin development, such as TGM1 and PADi3. This activity is crucial for maintaining protein stability and function, which is essential for skin health (Chen2020Palmitoyl). Additionally, ZDHHC13 is involved in mitochondrial dynamics by S-palmitoylating Drp1, impacting mitochondrial function and bioenergetics (Napoli2017Zdhhc13dependent).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZDHHC13 gene, which encodes a palmitoyl acyltransferase, have been linked to several severe phenotypes in mice, providing insights into potential human conditions. A nonsense mutation in ZDHHC13 results in a truncated protein that lacks the active site necessary for palmitoylation, leading to conditions such as alopecia, osteoporosis, and systemic amyloidosis (Saleem2010Mice). These phenotypes are characterized by hair loss, reduced bone mineral density, and generalized amyloid deposition, which can result in early death (Saleem2010Mice).

ZDHHC13 mutations also affect skin integrity, leading to atopic dermatitis (AD)-like conditions. Mice deficient in ZDHHC13 exhibit skin inflammation and are more susceptible to environmental bacteria, suggesting that microbial factors trigger the inflammation rather than intrinsic adaptive immunity (Chen2017Protein). This condition is associated with elevated levels of IL-33 and type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) in the skin, indicating a role of innate immunity in AD development (Chen2017Protein).

In addition, ZDHHC13 mutations are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic disorders. Zdhhc13-deficient mice show hypermetabolism and defective lipid metabolism, linked to impaired S-palmitoylation of mitochondrial proteins (Shen2017Role). These findings suggest that ZDHHC13 plays a critical role in maintaining normal metabolic and immune functions, and its mutations can lead to various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
ZDHHC13, a palmitoyl acyltransferase, is involved in various protein interactions through its enzymatic activity. It interacts with and palmitoylates proteins such as TGM1 and PADi3, which are crucial for skin barrier development. These interactions are essential for the stability and function of these proteins, as demonstrated by reduced protein levels in Zdhhc13 mutant mice (Chen2020Palmitoyl). ZDHHC13 also interacts with the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R), enhancing its signaling and increasing melanin synthesis through phosphorylation at Ser 8 by ATR kinase (Zmuda2020Regulatory). 

In the context of mitochondrial function, ZDHHC13 palmitoylates Drp1, a protein critical for mitochondrial dynamics. This interaction affects mitochondrial targeting and distribution, impacting energy metabolism and contributing to neurobehavioral abnormalities in Zdhhc13-deficient mice (Napoli2017Zdhhc13dependent). ZDHHC13 also interacts with proteins involved in mitochondrial regulation, such as MCAT and CTNND1, with identified palmitoylation sites that are crucial for their function (Shen2017Role). These interactions highlight the role of ZDHHC13 in maintaining cellular and mitochondrial integrity through its palmitoyltransferase activity.
