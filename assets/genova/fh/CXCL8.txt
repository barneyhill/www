# CXCL8

## Overview
CXCL8, also known as interleukin-8 (IL-8), is a gene that encodes a chemokine protein belonging to the CXC chemokine family. This protein plays a pivotal role in the immune system by acting as a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils, a type of white blood cell essential for the inflammatory response. The CXCL8 protein is characterized by its ELR motif, which is crucial for its function in neutrophil chemotaxis and activation (Cheng2017Effects). It interacts with specific G protein-coupled receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2, to mediate its effects on immune cells (Cambier2023The). Beyond its role in immune cell recruitment, CXCL8 is involved in processes such as angiogenesis and tissue repair, highlighting its significance in both normal physiological and pathological conditions, including cancer and inflammatory diseases (Russo2014The; Cambier2023The).

## Structure
The CXCL8 protein, also known as Interleukin-8 (IL-8), is a member of the ELR-CXC chemokine family. Its primary structure includes a tri-peptide motif of ELR at the NH2 terminus, which is crucial for its function in neutrophil chemotaxis and activation (Cheng2017Effects). The secondary structure of CXCL8 consists of three antiparallel β-strands connected by loops and a C-terminal α-helix that lays back on the β-sheet (Cheng2017Effects). The tertiary structure is stabilized by two disulfide bonds, specifically between Cys 7 to Cys 34 and Cys 9 to Cys 50, which are essential for receptor recognition and biological activity (Cheng2017Effects). The quaternary structure of CXCL8 is a homologous dimer (Cheng2017Effects).

Specific domains and regions important for receptor binding and activation include residues E4-R6, I10-I22, and S30-A35, with the C-terminal α-helix playing a crucial role in stabilizing the tertiary structure (Cheng2017Effects). The protein can exist in both monomeric and dimeric forms, with the dimer being the high-affinity ligand for glycosaminoglycans (Joseph2015Solution). The structural plasticity of CXCL8 allows for multiple binding interactions, particularly with glycosaminoglycans like heparin (Joseph2015Solution).

## Function
The CXCL8 gene encodes a chemokine protein known as interleukin-8 (IL-8), which plays a significant role in the immune response by acting as a potent neutrophil chemoattractant. CXCL8 is produced by various cell types, including leukocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells, in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli such as lipopolysaccharides, IL-1, and TNF-α (Cambier2023The). It interacts with specific receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2, which are G protein-coupled receptors predominantly expressed on neutrophils and other immune cells. These interactions lead to downstream signaling that promotes neutrophil recruitment and activation, playing a crucial role in the inflammatory response (Cambier2023The).

CXCL8 is involved in the regulation of leukocyte attraction, which is crucial for inflammatory responses. Its activity is tightly controlled at multiple levels to prevent excessive inflammation (Cambier2023The). Beyond immune cell regulation, CXCL8 also promotes angiogenesis, tissue repair, blood flow restoration after organ transplantation, and wound healing by stimulating the migration and proliferation of endothelial cells and keratinocytes (Cambier2023The). CXCL8's interaction with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) helps maintain a concentration gradient for neutrophil chemotaxis and protects the chemokine from proteolysis, which can modulate the inflammatory response (Cambier2023The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CXCL8 gene are associated with various diseases. In myelofibrosis (MF), a type of bone marrow fibrosis, CXCL8 is enriched and aberrantly secreted, promoting the proliferation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. This contributes to significant bone marrow fibrosis and leukocytosis, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for MF (Dunbar2021CXCL8CXCR2). In cancer, CXCL8 is involved in tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. It is highly expressed in several cancers, including breast, renal, prostate, and gastric cancers, where it affects neoplastic proliferation and metastasis (Wu2012Modulation; Snoussi2010Combined). 

In inflammatory diseases, CXCL8 plays a role in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriasis. In RA, it contributes to neutrophil recruitment and disease severity, while in psoriasis, it is involved in keratinocyte hyperproliferation and angiogenesis (Russo2014The). CXCL8 is also implicated in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cystic fibrosis (CF), where it contributes to neutrophil chemotaxis and inflammation (Russo2014The). Genetic polymorphisms in CXCL8 are linked to increased susceptibility to Helicobacter pylori infection, which raises the risk of gastric cancer (Boonyanugomol2019Genetic).

## Interactions
CXCL8, also known as interleukin-8 (IL-8), interacts with several proteins, primarily through its role as a chemokine. It binds with high affinity to the CXCR1 and CXCR2 receptors on neutrophils, facilitating chemotaxis and activation. The binding involves a dynamic network of interactions, including backbone-backbone, backbone-side chain, and side chain-side chain interactions, particularly involving the N-loop residues of IL-8 and the receptor N-domain (Ravindran2009Structural). The monomeric form of IL-8 is identified as the high-affinity ligand for these receptors, while the dimeric form shows significantly reduced binding affinity (Rajarathnam2006Probing).

CXCL8 also interacts with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) on cell surfaces, which is crucial for its localization and function. The CXC motif in CXCL8 influences its binding to GAGs, affecting its physiological role (Joseph2010Probing). Additionally, CXCL8 interacts with TSG-6, a protein that inhibits neutrophil migration. This interaction impairs CXCL8's binding to heparin and other GAGs, potentially limiting neutrophil recruitment (Dyer2014TSG6). These interactions highlight CXCL8's role in modulating inflammatory responses through its binding to receptors and other proteins.
