# RALBP1

## Overview
RALBP1 is a gene that encodes the protein ralA binding protein 1, also known as RLIP76, which is a multifunctional effector protein involved in various cellular processes. RLIP76 is categorized as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) and plays a critical role in modulating the actin cytoskeleton and endocytosis through its interactions with small GTPases such as RalA, RalB, CDC42, and Rac1. The protein is characterized by its multidomain structure, including a Ral-binding domain and a RhoGAP domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its involvement in signal transduction pathways. RLIP76 is also implicated in synaptic plasticity, particularly in neurons, where it regulates AMPA receptor endocytosis during NMDA receptor-dependent long-term depression. Additionally, RLIP76 functions as a non-ATP binding cassette transporter, contributing to drug resistance in cancer by mediating the efflux of glutathione conjugates of electrophiles. Alterations in RALBP1 expression or function have been associated with various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its significance as a potential therapeutic target (BennaniBaiti2015Inflammation; Han2009Regulated; Awasthi2021RALBP1; Cantor1995Identification).

## Structure
The RALBP1 protein, also known as RLIP76, is a multidomain protein that plays a role as an effector for the Ral family of small GTPases. It contains several key domains, including a Ral-binding domain (RBD) and a RhoGAP domain. The RBD is characterized by a coiled-coil structure formed by two α-helices separated by a flexible short linker, which interacts with the switch regions of RalB, undergoing conformational changes upon GTP binding (Fenwick2010The; Mott2014Structure). The RhoGAP domain, which is active against Cdc42 and Rac1 but not RhoA, forms a canonical fold comprising nine α-helices, with a core structure of a four-helix bundle (Mott2014Structure; Mott2010RLIP76).

The RLIP76 protein also contains ATP-binding sequences, including a Walker A motif and a sequence homologous to the ATP-binding motif from phosphoglycerate kinase, which are significant for its function as a membrane ATPase (Mott2014Structure; Mott2010RLIP76). The protein can undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its interactions and cellular localization (Fenwick2010The). RLIP76 is known to exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may affect its function and interactions (Mott2010RLIP76).

## Function
RALBP1, also known as Ral-binding protein 1, is a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes. It acts as a downstream effector of Ral GTPases, specifically binding to the active, GTP-bound form of RalA, and plays a role in modulating the actin cytoskeleton through interactions with CDC42, a member of the Rho family of GTPases (Cantor1995Identification). RALBP1 contains a Rho-GTPase-activating protein domain that enhances the GTP hydrolysis activity of CDC42, suggesting its involvement in cellular processes like bud site selection and filopodium formation (Cantor1995Identification).

In neurons, RALBP1 is crucial for synaptic plasticity, particularly in the regulation of AMPA receptor endocytosis during NMDA receptor-dependent long-term depression (LTD). It interacts with RalA and the postsynaptic scaffolding protein PSD-95, facilitating the endocytosis of AMPA receptors, which is essential for synaptic strength modulation (Han2009Regulated). RALBP1's phosphorylation state, regulated by protein phosphatase 1 and protein kinase A, affects its interaction with PSD-95, highlighting its role in synaptic signaling (Han2009Regulated).

Additionally, RALBP1 functions as a non-ATP binding cassette transporter, mediating the efflux of glutathione conjugates of electrophiles, contributing to drug resistance in various cancers (BennaniBaiti2015Inflammation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the RALBP1 gene, which encodes the protein RLIP76, have been implicated in several diseases. In cancer, increased expression of RLIP76 is necessary for carcinogenesis, and its elevated levels in cancer cells may enhance signaling pathways that promote tumor growth. RLIP76's role in clathrin-dependent endocytosis (CDE) and its interactions with proteins involved in stress and insulin responses suggest that targeting these interactions could lead to new cancer treatments (Singhal2011GlutathioneConjugate). RALBP1 is also involved in multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer cells, where its overexpression leads to resistance against various chemotherapy drugs. Inhibition of RALBP1 increases drug accumulation and cytotoxicity, making it a potential therapeutic target in leukemia and other cancers (Drake2007RALBP1RLIP76).

In neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD), RALBP1 is linked to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Deficiency in RLIP76 leads to increased oxidative stress markers and impaired synaptic health, contributing to cognitive decline. RALBP1's role in detoxifying harmful byproducts like 4-HNE and maintaining mitochondrial health is crucial in preventing neurodegeneration (Awasthi2021RALBP1; Hindle2022Rlip76:). Changes in RALBP1 expression or functionality can impact neurotransmission, potentially leading to conditions like AD (Hindle2022Rlip76:).

## Interactions
RALBP1, also known as ralA binding protein 1, interacts with a variety of proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes such as endocytosis and actin cytoskeleton regulation. It specifically binds to the active GTP-bound forms of RalA and RalB, which are small GTPases involved in these processes (Boissel2012Identification; Cantor1995Identification). RALBP1 also acts as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for CDC42 and Rac, which are involved in actin cytoskeleton regulation and signal transduction pathways (Yamaguchi1997An).

RALBP1 interacts with the postsynaptic density protein PSD-95, a scaffolding protein, which is crucial for AMPA receptor endocytosis during NMDA receptor-dependent long-term depression (LTD) in neurons (Han2009Regulated). This interaction is regulated by the phosphorylation state of RALBP1, which is dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) upon NMDA receptor activation, enhancing its binding to PSD-95 (Han2009Regulated).

Additionally, RALBP1 forms complexes with other proteins such as POB1 and AP2, which are involved in endocytic pathways. The interaction with AP2, particularly its m2 subunit, is part of a pathway that facilitates AMPA receptor endocytosis (Boissel2012Identification; Han2009Regulated). RALBP1 also interacts with Reps1, a protein containing an Eps homology (EH) domain, which may influence endocytosis and actin cytoskeleton dynamics (Yamaguchi1997An).
