# C3orf49

## Overview
C3orf49 is a gene located on chromosome 3 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 3 open reading frame 49. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including interactions with RNA and potential roles in nucleolar dynamics. C3orf49 is characterized by its ability to form condensates at the nucleolar periphery, particularly under conditions of transcriptional shutdown, suggesting a regulatory function modulated by RNA availability (Boeynaems2023Aberrant). The protein has also been identified in extracellular vesicles from breast cancer cell lines, indicating a possible role in cancer-related protein-protein interactions and serving as a potential biomarker for cancer diagnosis (Matthiesen2020Extracellular). Additionally, C3orf49 is noted for its upregulation in certain cellular contexts, such as in degenerative nucleus pulposus cells, although its specific interactions in these scenarios remain to be fully elucidated (Han2018Aberrantly).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
C3orf49 is implicated in various cellular interactions, particularly in relation to its condensation behavior and potential interactions with RNA. The protein has been identified to target nucleoli and localize to the nucleolar periphery, forming assemblies reminiscent of nucleolar stress caps under transcriptional shutdown conditions. This suggests that C3orf49's condensation behavior is modulated by RNA availability, indicating a potential interaction with nucleic acids (Boeynaems2023Aberrant).

In the context of cancer research, C3orf49 has been detected in the proteomic analysis of extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from breast cancer cell lines. This finding suggests that C3orf49 may be involved in the protein-protein interactions within the EVs, which are known to reflect the proteome of their cell origins and could serve as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis (Matthiesen2020Extracellular).

Additionally, C3orf49 was identified as one of the most upregulated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in degenerative nucleus pulposus cells co-cultured with adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells, with a significant fold change. However, specific physical interactions of the C3orf49 protein with other proteins or nucleic acids were not detailed in this study (Han2018Aberrantly).
