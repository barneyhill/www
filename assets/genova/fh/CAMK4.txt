# CAMK4

## Overview
The CAMK4 gene encodes the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV), a serine/threonine kinase that plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and immune response modulation. As a kinase, CaMKIV is activated through a calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation cascade, allowing it to phosphorylate key transcription factors such as CREB, which is essential for memory and learning (Takemoto‐Kimura2017Calmodulin). The protein is predominantly localized in the nucleus and is involved in the regulation of T follicular helper cells, influencing cytokine production and antibody generation (Scherlinger2024CaMK4). Additionally, CaMKIV is implicated in iron homeostasis and transferrin trafficking in the brain (Sabbir2020CAMKK2CAMK4). Mutations in the CAMK4 gene have been associated with autoimmune disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, and neurodevelopmental conditions, including intellectual disability and autism, underscoring its clinical significance (Koga2012CalciumCalmodulinDependent; Zech2018A).

## Structure
The human CAMK4 protein, encoded by the CAMKIV gene, is a serine/threonine kinase involved in various cellular processes. Its primary structure consists of a mature polypeptide with 473 amino acids and a molecular mass of 51,925 Da (Naz2016Calciumcalmodulindependent). The protein's secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-strands, contributing to its overall stability and function (Naz2016Calciumcalmodulindependent).

CAMK4's tertiary structure is characterized by distinct domains, including a kinase domain responsible for its enzymatic activity, an autoinhibitory domain, a nucleotide-binding domain, a serine/threonine phosphatase 2A (PP2A)-binding domain, and a CaM-binding domain (Naz2016Calciumcalmodulindependent). The CaM-binding domain contains a serine residue at position 332, which prevents calmodulin binding upon phosphorylation (Naz2016Calciumcalmodulindependent). The kinase domain includes active site residues Lys75 and Asp164, essential for its catalytic function (Naz2016Calciumcalmodulindependent).

CAMK4 does not form oligomers, indicating it operates as a monomer (Takemoto‐Kimura2017Calmodulin; Naz2016Calciumcalmodulindependent). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a crucial role in regulating its activity, particularly at the CaM-binding domain (Naz2016Calciumcalmodulindependent). The protein is activated by calmodulin-dependent kinase (CaMKK) through phosphorylation of a threonine residue in the activation loop (Takemoto‐Kimura2017Calmodulin). Splice variant isoforms, such as CaMKIVα and β, are produced through alternative splicing (Takemoto‐Kimura2017Calmodulin).

## Function
The CAMK4 gene encodes the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV), a serine/threonine kinase involved in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, CaMKIV is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation by phosphorylating transcription factors such as CREB, which is crucial for memory and learning processes (Takemoto‐Kimura2017Calmodulin). CaMKIV is activated through a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation cascade and can exhibit autonomous activity upon phosphorylation (Takemoto‐Kimura2017Calmodulin).

CaMKIV is also involved in the regulation of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, which are essential for the adaptive immune response. It controls the expression of BCL6, a transcription factor critical for Tfh cell function, and influences the production of cytokines like IL21, which are important for Tfh cell activity (Scherlinger2024CaMK4). Inhibition of CaMKIV in Tfh cells leads to decreased production of plasmablasts and IgG, highlighting its role in promoting antibody production (Scherlinger2024CaMK4).

Additionally, CaMKIV is implicated in the regulation of transferrin trafficking and iron homeostasis, particularly in the brain, by influencing protein-protein interactions within multiprotein complexes (Sabbir2020CAMKK2CAMK4).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CAMK4 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly autoimmune and neurodevelopmental disorders. In the context of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), increased activity of CaMK4 in T cells leads to abnormal immune responses. This includes the suppression of IL-2 production and impaired regulatory T cell activity, contributing to the pathogenesis of SLE. Inhibition of CaMK4 has been shown to ameliorate disease symptoms in lupus-prone mice, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Koga2012CalciumCalmodulinDependent).

CaMK4 is also involved in the differentiation of Th17 cells, which are associated with autoimmune conditions like experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and SLE. Inhibition of CaMK4 reduces IL-17 production and disease severity, highlighting its role in Th17/IL-17 imbalances (Koga2014CaMK4dependent).

In neurodevelopmental disorders, a unique de novo gain-of-function variant in CAMK4 has been linked to intellectual disability, autism, and hyperkinetic movement disorders. This variant results in a truncated CaMKIV protein with constitutive activity, leading to excessive signaling and associated neurological symptoms (Zech2018A). Another case involving a different CAMK4 mutation also presented with similar neurodevelopmental abnormalities, further supporting the gene's role in these conditions (Alawneh2023CAMK4‐related).

## Interactions
CAMK4 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular signaling pathways. It forms a complex with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which is essential for maintaining CAMK4 in a deactivated state in the absence of stimuli. This interaction occurs in a 1:1 stoichiometric complex, with up to 43% of cellular CAMK4 associated with PP2A (Chow2007The). The binding of PP2A to CAMK4 negatively regulates its activity, and the interaction is mutually exclusive with the binding of Ca2+/calmodulin, which activates CAMK4 (Naz2016Calciumcalmodulindependent).

CAMK4 also interacts with calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK), which phosphorylates CAMK4, leading to its activation. This interaction is Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent, facilitating rapid activation of CAMK4 upon Ca2+/CaM binding (Park1995Activation; Chow2007The). In addition, CAMK4 phosphorylates transcription factors such as CREB, MEF2D, and JUN, influencing gene transcription and various cellular processes (Naz2016Calciumcalmodulindependent).

In podocytes, CAMK4 interacts with 14-3-3β, leading to the phosphorylation of 14-3-3β and disruption of its binding to synaptopodin, which affects the actin cytoskeleton (Maeda2018CaMK4). These interactions highlight CAMK4's role in diverse cellular functions and regulatory mechanisms.
