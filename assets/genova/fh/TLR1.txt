# TLR1

## Overview
TLR1 (Toll-like receptor 1) is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in the innate immune system's response to pathogens. The TLR1 protein is a member of the Toll-like receptor family, which plays a pivotal role in recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and initiating immune responses. TLR1 forms heterodimers with TLR2, enabling the recognition of tri-acylated lipopeptides, which are components of bacterial cell walls. This interaction is crucial for activating downstream signaling pathways that lead to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, thereby modulating immune responses. The TLR1 gene exhibits polymorphisms that can influence its function and, consequently, an individual's susceptibility to infections and inflammatory diseases (Dittrich2015Tolllike; Hawn2007A).

## Structure
TLR1 (Toll-like receptor 1) is a protein that plays a crucial role in the immune system by recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns. The primary structure of TLR1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form a protein with a three-domain architecture, including N-terminal, central, and C-terminal domains (Jin2007Crystal). The secondary structure is characterized by leucine-rich repeat (LRR) modules, which contribute to its horseshoe-like shape with parallel beta strands forming concave surfaces (Jin2007Crystal).

The tertiary structure of TLR1 involves the 3D folding of the protein, forming a continuous lipid-binding site at the dimer interface when complexed with TLR2 and a tri-acylated lipopeptide, Pam3CSK4. This complex resembles the letter 'm', with the two C-terminal domains converging in the middle (Jin2007Crystal). The central and C-terminal domains of TLR1 have unique beta sheet conformations that differ from standard LRR structures, lacking the asparagine ladder and phenylalanine spine found in typical LRR proteins (Jin2007Crystal).

In its quaternary structure, TLR1 forms a heterodimer with TLR2, which is essential for signaling through tri-acylated lipopeptides. This dimerization is stabilized by extensive protein-protein interactions near the ligand-binding pocket (Jin2008Structures). The intracellular TIR domain of TLR1 is crucial for dimerization and adaptor recruitment, with specific residues like Pro681 playing a significant role in signal transduction (Jin2008Structures).

## Function
TLR1 (Toll-like receptor 1) is a critical component of the innate immune system, primarily involved in the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). It forms heterodimers with TLR2 to detect bacterial lipopeptides, which are components of various pathogens. This interaction triggers downstream signaling pathways, notably the activation of NF-kB, a transcription factor that regulates the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF (Dittrich2015Tolllike; Hawn2007A). 

The TLR1 protein is predominantly active on the cell surface of immune cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells, where it plays a role in initiating immune responses against infections (Hawn2007A). The TLR1 gene exhibits polymorphisms that can influence its function. For instance, the TLR1 SNP I602S affects NF-kB signaling and cytokine production, impacting the immune response to lipopeptides and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Hawn2007A). These genetic variations can alter susceptibility to infections and inflammatory diseases, highlighting TLR1's role in modulating immune responses and influencing disease outcomes (Dittrich2015Tolllike; Hawn2007A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the TLR1 gene have been associated with various diseases and conditions due to their impact on immune responses. The TLR1 27202A/G single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is linked to hypermorphic immune responses, resulting in elevated cytokine production. This SNP is associated with increased susceptibility to organ dysfunction, death, and sepsis-related acute lung injury in patients with sepsis (Wurfel2008Tolllike). The TLR1 1804G/T (Ser602Ile) polymorphism is also associated with hyperinflammatory responses, contributing to the severity of sepsis (Wurfel2008Tolllike).

The P315L polymorphism in TLR1 impairs the receptor's ability to mediate responses to microbial components, potentially predisposing individuals to infectious diseases (Omueti2007The). The TLR1-248N variant is associated with increased TNF production and NF-kB activation in response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, suggesting a heightened immune response and decreased susceptibility to tuberculosis (Dittrich2015Tolllike).

In the context of invasive aspergillosis, certain TLR1 SNPs, such as TLR1 239G > C (Arg80 > Thr), have been linked to increased risk in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (KESH2005TLR1). These findings underscore the clinical significance of TLR1 genetic variations in influencing susceptibility to infectious and inflammatory diseases.

## Interactions
TLR1 interacts with TLR2 to form heterodimers that are essential for recognizing tri-acylated bacterial lipopeptides, which are often associated with Gram-negative bacteria. The crystal structure of the TLR2-TLR1 heterodimer bound to Pam3CSK4 reveals that two acyl chains insert into the internal binding pocket of TLR2, while the third acyl chain inserts into a smaller binding channel in TLR1. This interaction is stabilized by a hydrophobic core and hydrophilic residues forming hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions (Berglund2015The).

TLR1 also participates in a receptor complex with TLR2 and CD14 upon stimulation with the lipopeptide Pam3CSK4-FLAG. This complex formation is indicated by Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) experiments, which show that TLR1 is in close proximity to CD14 and TLR2 during cell activation by the lipopeptide. The interaction is specific to Pam3CSK4-FLAG, as it is not observed with other TLR ligands like LPS and poly I:C (Manukyan2005Binding).

Mutations in TLR1, such as G676A and G676L, affect its interaction with TLR2, leading to reduced NF-κB activation. These mutations highlight the importance of specific residues in the TLR1/TLR2 interaction and signaling (Gautam2006Structural).
