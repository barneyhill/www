# SATL1

## Overview
SATL1 is a gene that encodes the protein spermidine/spermine N1-acetyl transferase like 1, which is a member of the acetyltransferase enzyme family. This protein is involved in the acetylation of polyamines, such as spermidine and spermine, playing a critical role in polyamine metabolism. The acetylation process facilitated by SATL1 is essential for maintaining polyamine homeostasis, which is crucial for various cellular functions, including DNA stabilization, gene expression, and ion channel regulation. SATL1 is predominantly active in the cytoplasm and is expressed in several tissues, with notable activity in the testes and specific brain regions. Its function is particularly significant in the context of neurological processes and disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), where it is implicated in cognitive and social functions. Additionally, SATL1 has been associated with cancer prognosis, particularly in ovarian cancer, suggesting a potential role as a tumor suppressor (Alayoubi2024Lossoffunction; Lin2020A).

## Function
The SATL1 gene encodes the spermidine/spermine N1-acetyl transferase like 1 protein, which plays a crucial role in polyamine metabolism by acetylating polyamines such as spermidine and spermine. This acetylation process is essential for regulating the intracellular levels of polyamines, which are vital for various cellular functions, including DNA stabilization, gene expression, and ion channel regulation (Alayoubi2024Lossoffunction; Lin2013The). The SATL1 protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it modulates polyamine homeostasis, impacting cell proliferation and apoptosis (Alayoubi2024Lossoffunction).

In healthy human cells, SATL1 is expressed in the cytosol and is involved in N-acetyltransferase activity, binding to spermidine. This activity is particularly significant in tissues with high expression levels, such as the testes and various brain regions, including the cerebellum, amygdala, and frontal cortex. These brain regions are associated with functions like social interaction, emotional recognition, and executive functions, which are relevant to conditions such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (Alayoubi2024Lossoffunction). The involvement of SATL1 in spermidine biosynthesis is also important for axonal regeneration and neuroprotection, contributing to improved memory and cognitive functions (Alayoubi2024Lossoffunction).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SATL1 gene have been implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A study identified a loss-of-function variant in SATL1, characterized by a novel C to G substitution in exon 6, which results in a premature termination codon. This mutation was found in a hemizygous state in two patients and was maternally inherited. The variant is rare, as it is not present in several genomic databases. The SATL1 protein, which includes substrate binding and acetyltransferase domains, is predicted to lose part of its acetyltransferase domain due to this nonsense variant, potentially activating a non-sense mediated decay pathway. SATL1 shows high expression in brain regions associated with ASD, such as the cerebellum, amygdala, and frontal cortex, which are linked to symptoms like social interaction impairments and cognitive dysfunctions (Alayoubi2024Lossoffunction).

In addition to its role in ASD, SATL1 has been associated with ovarian cancer prognosis. A study identified SATL1 as one of the genes significantly associated with ovarian cancer prognosis, suggesting it may act as a tumor suppressor (Lin2020A).
