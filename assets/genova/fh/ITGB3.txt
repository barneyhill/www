# ITGB3

## Overview
The ITGB3 gene encodes the integrin subunit beta 3, a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in cell adhesion and signaling. This subunit is a critical component of the integrin αIIbβ3 complex, which is essential for platelet aggregation and normal blood clotting processes. The integrin subunit beta 3 is characterized by several structural domains, including the PSI, hybrid, βI, and membrane proximal β-tail domains, which facilitate its function in metal ion-dependent adhesion and interaction with cytoskeletal proteins (Nurden2015Expanding). The ITGB3 gene is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including hemostasis, bone metabolism, and cancer progression. Mutations in ITGB3 are associated with Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a bleeding disorder, and have been linked to other conditions such as osteopetrosis and autism spectrum disorder (Gabriele2018Evidence; Nurden2011Glanzmann; Nurden2017Should). The integrin subunit beta 3's involvement in these diverse biological functions underscores its significance as a potential therapeutic target.

## Structure
The ITGB3 gene encodes the integrin subunit beta 3, which is a component of the integrin αIIbβ3 complex, crucial for platelet aggregation. The primary structure of ITGB3 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form several structural domains. These include the N-terminal PSI (plexin/semaphorin/integrin) domain, followed by the hybrid domain, the βI (βA) domain, disulfide-rich EGF (epidermal growth factor) domains, and membrane proximal β-tail domains (Nurden2015Expanding). The βI domain contains critical sites such as MIDAS (metal ion-dependent adhesion site), ADMIDAS (adjacent to MIDAS), and SYMBS (synergistic metal binding site), which are essential for the integrin's function in cell adhesion and signaling (Nurden2015Expanding).

The tertiary structure of ITGB3 involves the folding of these domains into a three-dimensional shape, stabilized by disulfide bonds, such as those between Cys13 and Cys435, which are crucial for the biogenesis of the αIIbβ3 receptor (Peretz2006Molecular). The quaternary structure is formed when ITGB3 pairs with an alpha subunit, commonly αIIb, to form the integrin αIIbβ3 complex (Peretz2006Molecular).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are common and may affect the protein's function and localization. Splice variant isoforms of ITGB3 may exist, potentially altering its function or localization (Jallu2010αIIbβ3). These structural features and modifications are critical for the integrin's role in platelet function and its involvement in disorders like Glanzmann thrombasthenia.

## Function
The ITGB3 gene encodes the integrin subunit beta 3, which is a critical component of the αIIbβ3 integrin complex. This integrin is essential for platelet aggregation, a key process in normal blood clotting. In healthy human cells, the β3 subunit is widely distributed in tissues and is associated with the vitronectin receptor (Nurden2015Expanding). The αIIbβ3 integrin undergoes posttranslational modifications, including glycosylations, in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. The mature integrin has single transmembrane domains and short cytoplasmic tails that interact with cytoskeletal and cytoplasmic proteins, such as talin and kindlin-3, facilitating bidirectional signaling (Nurden2015Expanding).

The β3 subunit contains several important domains, including the PSI domain, hybrid domain, βI domain, and membrane proximal β-tail domain. The βI domain is particularly significant as it contains the MIDAS, ADMIDAS, and SYMBS sites, which are crucial for metal ion-dependent adhesion (Nurden2015Expanding). In its resting state, the αIIbβ3 integrin is bent, but it straightens upon platelet activation, exposing binding sites for fibrinogen and other adhesive ligands. This structural change is essential for the integrin's role in mediating platelet aggregation and clot formation (Nurden2015Expanding).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ITGB3 gene, which encodes the integrin subunit beta 3, are associated with several clinical conditions. One of the primary disorders linked to ITGB3 mutations is Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT), a rare autosomal recessive bleeding disorder characterized by defects in platelet aggregation due to deficiencies in the αIIbβ3 integrin. This results in mucocutaneous bleeding and is caused by various mutations, including missense, nonsense, and splicing defects, leading to impaired integrin function (Nurden2011Glanzmann; Nurden2015Expanding).

ITGB3 mutations also play a role in bone disorders. For instance, a variant form of GT with a β3 mutation (S752P) is associated with impaired osteoclast function and increased bone thickening, suggesting a link to conditions like osteopetrosis (Nurden2017Should). In cancer, β3-integrins are implicated in tumor progression and metastasis, with β3-deficient mice showing increased tumor progression and angiogenic response (Nurden2017Should).

Additionally, ITGB3 promoter variants have been linked to hyperserotonemia, a condition characterized by elevated serotonin levels, which is a common endophenotype in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). These variants enhance ITGB3 promoter activity, leading to increased serotonin uptake in platelets (Gabriele2018Evidence).

## Interactions
ITGB3, or integrin subunit beta 3, is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins that facilitate its role in cellular processes. ITGB3 interacts with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), which are essential for the uptake of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in breast cancer cells. This interaction is crucial for the endocytosis of EVs, a process that involves DYNAMIN-dependent endocytosis and the activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) (Fuentes2020ITGB3mediated). ITGB3 is not an EV receptor but acts as a facilitator linking EV capture at the cell surface to their uptake via endocytosis (Fuentes2020ITGB3mediated).

In the context of viral infections, ITGB3 interacts with receptor of activated protein C kinase 1 (RACK1) during porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection. This interaction is essential for the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which promotes PRRSV infection (Yang2020Integrin). ITGB3 is also implicated in the cell entry of various viruses, including West Nile Virus and Herpes Simplex Virus, suggesting its role as part of a receptor complex for these pathogens (Yang2020Integrin).

These interactions highlight ITGB3's role in mediating cellular communication and its potential as a therapeutic target in both cancer and viral infections.
