# CDON

## Overview
CDON is a gene that encodes the cell adhesion associated, oncogene regulated protein, which is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules. This protein plays a pivotal role in cell-cell communication and is integral to the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, which is crucial for various developmental processes, including skeletal muscle development and neural tube patterning (DelloyeBourgeois2013Sonic; Tenzen2006The). The CDON protein is characterized by its ectodomain, which includes immunoglobulin-like domains and fibronectin type III repeats, facilitating its interaction with other proteins and ligands such as Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) (Song2015Distinct). These interactions are essential for its function as a dependence receptor, where it can induce apoptosis in the absence of its ligand (DelloyeBourgeois2013Sonic). Mutations in the CDON gene have been linked to congenital disorders like holoprosencephaly and pituitary stalk interruption syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in developmental biology (Bae2011Mutations; ObaraMoszyńska2021CDON).

## Structure
The CDON protein is a cell surface glycoprotein that belongs to the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily of cell adhesion molecules. It is encoded by the CDON gene located on the minus strand of chromosome 11q24.2 and consists of 20 exons. The protein has two isoforms, with lengths of 1287 and 1264 amino acids, respectively, and the shorter isoform is more extensively studied (SanchezArrones2012Cdon).

Structurally, CDON features an ectodomain composed of five Ig-like domains followed by three fibronectin type III (FNIII) repeats. These domains are crucial for its role in cell adhesion and signaling. The FNIII domains, particularly the FNIII(3) domain, are essential for binding Hedgehog (Hh) ligands, although they are not sufficient alone to activate the Hh pathway (Song2015Distinct). The protein also includes a single transmembrane domain and a divergent intracellular region (SanchezArrones2012Cdon).

CDON undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which influence its function and stability. The protein can form homo- and heteromeric complexes, interacting with other proteins like Neogenin and N-cadherin, as well as cytosolic proteins such as JLP, Abl, and Bnip-2 (SanchezArrones2012Cdon). These interactions are involved in various signaling pathways, including the p38 pathway, which is important for myoblast and neuronal differentiation.

## Function
The CDON gene encodes a cell surface protein that plays a significant role in cell-cell communication and signaling pathways, particularly the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. In healthy human cells, CDON is involved in the regulation of apoptosis and acts as a dependence receptor. In the absence of its ligand, Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), CDON can trigger apoptosis through a mechanism involving the proteolytic cleavage of its intracellular domain and the recruitment and activation of caspase-9, a key enzyme in the apoptotic pathway (DelloyeBourgeois2013Sonic).

CDON is also a positive regulator of skeletal muscle development and is involved in the SHH signaling pathway, which is crucial for various developmental processes (DelloyeBourgeois2013Sonic). It is expressed in specific Hh-signaling domains, such as the neural tube and limb mesenchyme, and is essential for normal floor plate specification in the neural tube (Tenzen2006The). CDON enhances SHH signaling by binding directly to SHH through a specific fibronectin repeat, which is necessary for its activity (Tenzen2006The). This interaction helps facilitate the presentation of the active ligand to other components of the signaling pathway, thereby increasing effective signaling levels (Tenzen2006The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CDON gene have been implicated in several congenital disorders, most notably holoprosencephaly (HPE) and pituitary stalk interruption syndrome (PSIS). HPE is a developmental disorder characterized by the failure of the forebrain to properly divide into two hemispheres, often resulting in craniofacial malformations. CDON functions as a co-receptor in the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway, which is crucial for forebrain and facial midline development. Loss-of-function mutations in CDON can lead to defective SHH signaling, contributing to HPE (Hong2012Cdon; Bae2011Mutations). 

CDON mutations have also been associated with PSIS, a condition marked by interrupted pituitary stalk, ectopic or absent posterior pituitary, and anterior pituitary hypoplasia. This syndrome can present with other midline and ophthalmic abnormalities (ObaraMoszyńska2021CDON). 

Research has shown that CDON mutations can interact with environmental factors, such as fetal ethanol exposure, exacerbating midline signaling defects and resulting in more severe HPE phenotypes. This suggests a gene-environment interaction model in the etiology of HPE (Hong2012Cdon; Hong2020Cdon). CDON mutations can also lead to a variety of phenotypes, including central nervous system abnormalities and distinct facial features (Farhud2024CDON).

## Interactions
The CDON protein, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is involved in various physical interactions crucial for its role in cell signaling and development. CDON interacts with N- and M-cadherins at the plasma membrane, which is important for skeletal muscle differentiation. This interaction stabilizes the association of CDON with Bnip-2/Cdc42 and JLP/p38α/β, leading to the activation of p38 and promoting myogenic differentiation (SanchezArrones2012Cdon). CDON also forms complexes with Neogenin, facilitating Netrin-mediated activation of FAK and ERK signaling in myoblasts (SanchezArrones2012Cdon).

In the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, CDON interacts with Ptch, Boc, and Gas1, forming a functional receptor complex essential for the proliferation of cerebellar granule neuron progenitors and the patterning of the mammalian ventral neural tube (SanchezArrones2012Cdon; Bae2011Mutations). CDON's interaction with PTCH1 and GAS1 is particularly important for SHH signaling, and mutations in CDON associated with holoprosencephaly impair these interactions, leading to reduced pathway activity (Bae2011Mutations).

CDON also interacts with BOC, forming complexes that regulate myogenic differentiation. This interaction occurs in a cis fashion, involving both extracellular and intracellular domains (Kang2002BOC).
