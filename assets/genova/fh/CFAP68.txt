# CFAP68

## Overview
CFAP68, or cilia and flagella associated protein 68, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the structure and function of cilia in human cells. The CFAP68 protein is categorized as a cilia-associated protein and is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and motility of cilia, which are essential for various cellular processes, including movement and signaling (Andersen2024Uncovering). It is characterized by Mn repeat units and an N-terminal NWE motif, which are conserved features that facilitate its binding to the microtubule lattice, thereby contributing to ciliary stability (Andersen2024Uncovering). CFAP68 is expressed in tissues such as the testis and epididymis, indicating a potential role in sperm tail specialization, although its absence does not significantly affect fertility in mice, suggesting compensatory mechanisms may exist (Nguyen2024Genedeficient). The protein's involvement in complex interactions with other ciliary proteins underscores its importance in the assembly and function of ciliary structures (Andersen2024Uncovering).

## Function
CFAP68, or cilia and flagella associated protein 68, plays a crucial role in the structure and function of cilia in human cells. It is primarily involved in maintaining the structural integrity and function of cilia, which are essential for various cellular processes, including movement and signaling. CFAP68 is found in the doublets of human airway epithelial cells, indicating its role as a cilia protein (Andersen2024Uncovering). The protein contains Mn repeat units and an N-terminal NWE motif, which are conserved across several proteins associated with cilia function. These motifs suggest that CFAP68 is involved in binding to the microtubule lattice, contributing to the stability and motility of cilia (Andersen2024Uncovering).

In the context of reproductive biology, CFAP68 is expressed in the testis and epididymis, suggesting a role in the structural specialization of the sperm tail. However, studies in mice have shown that the absence of CFAP68 does not significantly impact fertility, indicating potential compensatory mechanisms by other proteins (Nguyen2024Genedeficient). Despite this, CFAP68's involvement in cilia structure highlights its importance in maintaining proper ciliary function in human cells.

## Interactions
CFAP68 is involved in the structural integrity and assembly of ciliary components through its interactions with other proteins. It is part of a complex with other NWE module-containing proteins such as FAP67, FAP95, CFAP95, FAP143, and SPAG8, as well as filamentous microtubule inner proteins (fMIPs) like FAP53, CFAP53, FAP141, and CFAP141. These complexes are crucial for the assembly of the outer doublet microtubules in cilia (Andersen2024Uncovering). The NWE module, which includes CFAP68, plays a role in binding directly to the microtubule seam, stabilizing doublet microtubules, and transmitting the seam's unique position (Andersen2024Uncovering).

CFAP68 is also noted for its presence in human airway epithelial cells, where it functions as a cilia protein associated with the cilia outer doublet seam (Andersen2024Uncovering). Although specific interactions of CFAP68 with other proteins are not detailed in all studies, its involvement in these complexes suggests a significant role in maintaining ciliary structure and function. The study of CFAP68 and its interactions provides insights into the evolutionary conservation and functional importance of cilia-related proteins (Andersen2024Uncovering).
