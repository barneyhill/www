# SPINT2

## Overview
SPINT2 is a gene that encodes the serine peptidase inhibitor, Kunitz type 2, also known as hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor-2 (HAI-2). This protein is a serine protease inhibitor characterized by its two Kunitz-type domains, which are essential for its inhibitory function against various proteases, including matriptase and other transmembrane serine proteases (HoltDanborg2018SPINT2). SPINT2 plays a critical role in regulating proteolytic activity, particularly in epithelial tissues, where it maintains tissue integrity and homeostasis by modulating the activity of proteases involved in cell adhesion and migration (Kataoka2018Hepatocyte). The gene's expression and function are significant in various physiological processes and pathological conditions, including cancer and congenital disorders, where its dysregulation can lead to disease (Faller2014Functional; Kongkham2008An).

## Structure
The SPINT2 gene encodes the hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor-2 (HAI-2), a serine protease inhibitor characterized by two Kunitz-type domains, KD1 and KD2. These domains are integral to its function, with KD1 being a more potent inhibitor of matriptase compared to KD2 (HoltDanborg2018SPINT2). The Kunitz domains are small, compact structures stabilized by disulfide bonds, which are crucial for maintaining their stability and inhibitory function (Faller2014Functional).

The primary structure of HAI-2 includes specific residues such as Arg48-Cys47 in KD1 and Arg143 in KD2, which are involved in the inhibition of serine proteases by mimicking the substrate and forming an interaction resembling an enzyme-substrate Michaelis complex (HoltDanborg2018SPINT2). The secondary and tertiary structures are not detailed in the available context, but the Kunitz domains typically exhibit a pear-shaped fold with a binding loop at the top (HoltDanborg2018SPINT2).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation may influence the stability and activity of SPINT2, although specific details are not provided in the context. The protein does not have documented splice variant isoforms in the provided sources. The interaction of HAI-2 with proteases like prostasin and matriptase highlights its role in physiological processes, including epithelial homeostasis and cancer cell invasion (Wu2017The).

## Function
SPINT2 encodes a serine protease inhibitor that plays a crucial role in regulating proteolytic activity in human cells. It is involved in inhibiting the activation of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) by the HGF activator (HGFA), thereby limiting signaling via the HGF/MET pathway. This pathway is significant in brain tumor pathogenesis and influences cell cycle progression, tumor cell migration, invasion, and resistance to apoptosis (Kongkham2008An). SPINT2 is broadly expressed in epithelial tissues and is primarily detected in the cytoplasm, possibly localizing in the endoplasmic reticulum. It is essential for the proper localization and regulated activation of matriptase, a transmembrane serine protease, particularly in intestinal epithelial cells (Kataoka2018Hepatocyte).

SPINT2's role extends to maintaining epithelial integrity by regulating the activity of transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs), such as matriptase, and preventing excessive cleavage of epithelial cell adhesion molecules like EpCAM. This regulation is crucial for maintaining the integrity of epithelial tissues, as evidenced by its involvement in conditions like congenital sodium diarrhea when mutated (Kataoka2018Hepatocyte). SPINT2's activity in the extracellular space contributes to processes like wound healing and maintaining epithelial integrity, highlighting its importance in cellular and tissue homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the SPINT2 gene are associated with several medical conditions. In pediatric medulloblastoma, SPINT2 acts as a tumor suppressor gene. Its expression is often reduced due to promoter hypermethylation, leading to unchecked HGF/MET signaling, which contributes to tumor growth and malignancy (Kongkham2008An). In gliomas, particularly high-grade gliomas, SPINT2 is frequently downregulated due to promoter hypermethylation, resulting in increased tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. This is partly mediated through the regulation of MMP2 expression and activity (Pereira2019Loss).

SPINT2 mutations are also linked to congenital sodium diarrhea (CSD), a rare disorder characterized by severe diarrhea with high sodium content. The Y163C mutation in SPINT2 leads to a loss of function in inhibiting intestinal serine proteases, contributing to the pathogenesis of CSD (Faller2014Functional). Biallelic loss-of-function mutations in SPINT2 can cause a syndromic form of CSD, which includes additional features such as choanal atresia and corneal erosions (Hirabayashi2018Congenital). These mutations disrupt normal sodium absorption in the intestines, leading to the clinical manifestations of the disease (Bou2017Syndromic).

## Interactions
SPINT2, also known as hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor-2 (HAI-2), is a serine protease inhibitor that interacts with several proteases, playing a crucial role in regulating their activity. It forms stable complexes with matriptase, a widely expressed membrane serine protease, effectively inhibiting its activity. This interaction is facilitated by the Kunitz-type inhibitor domains of SPINT2, which are crucial for binding to target proteases (Szabo2008Potent). SPINT2 also inhibits other serine proteases such as trypsin, plasmin, and kallikreins, which are involved in the activation of viral proteins like influenza A hemagglutinin (HA) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) fusion proteins (Straus2020SPINT2).

In the context of glioma, SPINT2 regulates extracellular matrix-modulating proteases, particularly MMP2, which is involved in cell invasion. SPINT2 can inhibit MMP2 activity, thereby reducing cell migration and invasion (Pereira2019Loss). Additionally, SPINT2 interacts with cell adhesion molecules such as E-cadherin, influencing cell cohesion and migration during zebrafish hatching gland development (Hatzold2021The). These interactions highlight SPINT2's role in various physiological and pathological processes.
