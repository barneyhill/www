against decapentaplegic' (Mad) and the C. elegans gene Sma. The SMAD3 protein functions in the transforming growth factor-beta signaling pathway, and transmits signals from the cell surface to the nucleus, regulating gene activity and cell proliferation. This protein forms a complex with other SMAD proteins and binds DNA, functioning both as a transcription factor and tumor suppressor. Mutations in this gene are associated with aneurysms-osteoarthritis syndrome and Loeys-Dietz Syndrome 3.
