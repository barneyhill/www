# DAPK2

## Overview
DAPK2, or death-associated protein kinase 2, is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase involved in critical cellular processes such as apoptosis, autophagy, and cytoskeletal regulation. The protein product of DAPK2 is a calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase, which means its activity is modulated by calcium ions and the calcium-binding messenger protein calmodulin (Kawai1999Deathassociated). Structurally, DAPK2 features a kinase domain, an autoinhibitory domain, a Ca2+/calmodulin-binding domain, and a unique C-terminal tail, which collectively contribute to its regulatory functions (Horvath20211433). Functionally, DAPK2 is involved in the negative regulation of mTORC1, thereby promoting autophagy under stress conditions, and plays a role in the motility of immune cells such as neutrophils and eosinophils (Ber2014DAPK2; Geering2013DAPK2). Clinically, alterations in DAPK2 expression and function are associated with various cancers, where it often acts as a tumor suppressor, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Farag2018Death‐associated; Jin2021Cigarette).

## Structure
DAPK2, a member of the death-associated protein kinase family, is a serine/threonine kinase involved in apoptosis and autophagy. The primary structure of DAPK2 includes a kinase domain (residues 23-285), an autoinhibitory domain (AID, residues 287-311), a Ca2+/calmodulin-binding domain (CBD, residues 312-330), and a unique C-terminal tail (Horvath20211433). The secondary structure features alpha helices and beta sheets, with the autoinhibitory region composed of two helices, αR0 and αR1, which are crucial for its regulation (Patel2011Structure).

The tertiary structure of DAPK2 involves folding into a compact, functional enzyme, with the kinase domain in an active conformation when occupied by the autoinhibitory region (Horvath20211433). The quaternary structure of DAPK2 is characterized by a dimeric autoinhibited conformation, where the protein forms dimers through the association of two catalytic domains, a conformation that prevents substrate binding (Patel2011Structure).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation at Ser318, regulate DAPK2 activity by disrupting homodimerization and preventing Ca2+/CaM binding (Horvath20211433). DAPK2 also has splice variant isoforms, such as DAPK2b, which lacks the Ca2+/CaM-binding ARD, indicating structural variation from the original DAPK2a sequence (Temmerman2013Structural).

## Function
Death-associated protein kinase 2 (DAPK2) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in several cellular processes, including apoptosis, autophagy, and the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics. DAPK2 is a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, meaning its activity is regulated by calcium ions and calmodulin, a calcium-binding messenger protein (Kawai1999Deathassociated). In healthy human cells, DAPK2 is involved in the regulation of autophagy, a process essential for cellular homeostasis and adaptation to metabolic stress. It achieves this by phosphorylating key autophagic proteins such as Beclin-1, which promotes the dissociation of inhibitory interactions and facilitates autophagy induction (Shiloh2018Noncanonical).

DAPK2 also negatively regulates mTORC1, a central signaling complex that controls cell growth and metabolism, by phosphorylating its component raptor, thereby promoting autophagy under stress conditions (Ber2014DAPK2). In the immune system, DAPK2 is crucial for the motility of neutrophils and eosinophils, types of granulocytes, by phosphorylating myosin light chain, which is essential for cell polarization and migration (Geering2013DAPK2). This function is significant in inflammatory responses, as it aids in the recruitment of these cells to sites of inflammation (Geering2013DAPK2).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the DAPK2 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. DAPK2 is often downregulated in various cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), due to mechanisms such as promoter hypermethylation and aberrant N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications. In NSCLC, cigarette smoking induces m6A modifications on DAPK2 mRNA, leading to its downregulation and contributing to cancer progression. This downregulation is associated with poorer prognosis in smokers with NSCLC (Jin2021Cigarette). 

In addition to lung cancer, DAPK2 is implicated in myeloid leukemias, where its expression is reduced due to promoter methylation. This reduction is linked to a block in granulocytic differentiation, which can be partially reversed by demethylating agents (Rizzi2007The). 

DAPK2 also plays a role in regulating oxidative stress and mitochondrial integrity. Its depletion increases oxidative stress and sensitizes cancer cells to apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in certain cancers (Farag2018Death‐associated). 

Overall, DAPK2's tumor suppressor function is compromised in several cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions aimed at restoring its expression and activity.

## Interactions
DAPK2 interacts with a variety of proteins, influencing its role in cellular processes such as apoptosis and autophagy. One significant interaction is with 14-3-3 proteins, which inactivate DAPK2 by promoting its dimerization and protecting key regulatory phosphosites. This interaction involves the phosphorylation of DAPK2 at Ser 318 and Thr 369, creating binding sites for 14-3-3 proteins, particularly the 14-3-3γ isoform. This binding stabilizes the dimeric form of DAPK2 and prevents Ca2+/CaM binding, thereby inhibiting its activity (Horvath20211433).

DAPK2 also interacts with components of the cytoskeleton, such as b-tubulin. This interaction is mediated through the C-terminal region of DAPK2 and is enhanced by nocodazole treatment, which promotes the release of DAPK2 from 14-3-3 proteins, allowing it to bind to tubulin. This interaction is implicated in nocodazole-induced apoptosis (Isshiki2015Deathassociated).

Additionally, DAPK2 interacts with α-actinin-1 and 14-3-3-β. The interaction with α-actinin-1 occurs at the plasma membrane and is associated with increased cellular blebbing and reduced motility, while the interaction with 14-3-3-β is cytoplasmic and does not affect these processes (Geering2016Identification).
