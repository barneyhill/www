# CHRM1

## Overview
The CHRM1 gene encodes the cholinergic receptor muscarinic 1, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is integral to the cholinergic system, primarily within the central nervous system. This receptor is involved in modulating neurotransmission and plays a pivotal role in various cognitive functions, including attention, memory, and sensory processing. The muscarinic 1 receptor, encoded by CHRM1, is predominantly expressed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, where it influences excitability and neurotransmitter release in neurons. As a transmembrane receptor, it interacts with G proteins, particularly of the Gq/11 sub-family, to mediate intracellular signaling pathways. The receptor's function is modulated by post-translational modifications and its interactions with other proteins, which are crucial for its role in signal transduction and its involvement in neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders (Scarr2016The; SalahUddin2009Altered; Gulledge2009M1).

## Structure
CHRM1, or cholinergic receptor muscarinic 1, is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a crucial role in neurotransmission. The primary structure of CHRM1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein. This sequence is organized into a secondary structure characterized by alpha helices, which are typical of GPCRs. These helices are arranged in a transmembrane domain, contributing to the receptor's tertiary structure. The arrangement of these helices is essential for the receptor's function, as it facilitates the interaction with G proteins and other signaling molecules.

CHRM1 is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and glycosylation. These modifications can significantly impact the receptor's function and signaling capabilities. Phosphorylation may alter the receptor's activity or its interaction with other proteins, while glycosylation can affect its stability and localization within the cell.

The receptor does not have a quaternary structure as it functions as a monomer. However, its ability to interact with other proteins and form complexes is crucial for its role in signal transduction. The structural features of CHRM1 are integral to its function in the cholinergic system, influencing various physiological processes.

## Function
The CHRM1 gene encodes the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1, a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a critical role in the central nervous system. M1 receptors are predominantly found in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, where they are involved in modulating excitability and neurotransmitter release in pyramidal neurons (Scarr2016The; Gulledge2009M1). These receptors are crucial for both phasic and tonic cholinergic signaling, influencing excitatory and inhibitory responses in neurons (Gulledge2009M1). 

M1 receptors are involved in Gq-mediated phosphoinositide turnover, which is linked to cognitive functions such as attention, sensory processing, and long-term memory (Fernández2021Muscarinic; Gulledge2009M1). They modulate synaptic plasticity and are essential for generating theta and gamma oscillations, which are important for cognitive processes (Fernández2021Muscarinic). 

In the hippocampus, M1 receptors are primarily located on pyramidal neurons in the CA2 and CA3 regions, where they modulate acetylcholine-mediated glutamatergic neurotransmission, crucial for learning and memory (Scarr2016The). The absence of M1 receptors leads to deficits in cholinergic modulation and long-term potentiation, highlighting their vital role in cognitive functions (Scarr2016The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CHRM1 gene have been implicated in several neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders. Mutations in CHRM1 are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) and epilepsy. Two unrelated patients with de novo missense variants in CHRM1 exhibited severe neurodevelopmental impairments and epilepsy, with one patient experiencing early-onset refractory epilepsy and progressive cerebral and cerebellar atrophy (Marcé‐Grau2021Muscarinic).

In Huntington's disease (HD), CHRM1 expression is downregulated in striatal neurons, impairing Ca2+ signaling. This downregulation is linked to epigenetic regulation by histone modification, specifically H3K9me3, leading to transcriptional repression and synaptic dysfunction (Lee2013Epigenetic).

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), CHRM1 is significantly downregulated in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, affecting learning and memory processes. This loss of CHRM1 is associated with reduced mitochondrial respiration and altered mitochondrial ultrastructure, contributing to the pathogenesis of AD (Sabbir2023Hippocampal).

In colorectal adenocarcinomas, CHRM1 expression is attenuated, which is associated with changes in the β-catenin signaling pathway. This suggests a potential protective role of CHRM1 against colon cancer progression (Alizadeh2022Mechanistic).

## Interactions
The CHRM1 gene encodes the m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, which is involved in various protein interactions critical for its function. CHRM1 primarily interacts with G proteins of the Gq/11 sub-family, facilitating GTP-for-GDP exchange on the Gαq/11 subunit, which is essential for signal transduction pathways (SalahUddin2009Altered). In schizophrenia, particularly in the muscarinic receptor-deficit schizophrenia (MRDS) subgroup, CHRM1 shows altered coupling with Gαq/11 proteins, where despite reduced receptor expression, the coupling efficiency is increased (SalahUddin2009Altered).

CHRM1 also interacts with β-arrestin 1, which is involved in receptor desensitization and internalization, and GNAI2, a G protein subunit (Apostolakou2019Extended). These interactions are part of the signaling pathways that include kinases such as protein kinase C (PKC) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2), which are implicated in Alzheimer's disease (Apostolakou2019Extended).

Additionally, CHRM1 has been studied using DNA-barcoded proteins to profile its interactions with small molecules and other proteins, such as β-arrestin-2, in high-throughput screening assays (Gu2014Multiplex). These interactions highlight the receptor's role in various cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target.
