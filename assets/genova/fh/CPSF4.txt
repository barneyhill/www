# CPSF4

## Overview
CPSF4, or cleavage and polyadenylation specific factor 4, is a gene that encodes a protein component of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex, which is integral to the 3' end processing of pre-mRNA. The protein, also referred to as CPSF30, is characterized by its zinc finger motifs and functions primarily as a scaffold within the CPSF complex, facilitating the recognition and binding of pre-mRNA to the cleavage site. It plays a pivotal role in mRNA maturation, stability, and export, as well as in the regulation of alternative polyadenylation, which contributes to mRNA diversity (Dubois2019The; Choudhry2023Cleavage). CPSF4's interactions with other CPSF components, such as CPSF160 and WDR33, are crucial for effective polyadenylation signal recognition. Beyond its fundamental role in RNA processing, CPSF4 has been implicated in various cancers, where its altered expression levels are associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis (Zhang2021Overproduced; Chen2013Upregulation).

## Function
CPSF4, also known as CPSF30, is a crucial component of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex, which is essential for the 3' end processing of pre-mRNA in healthy human cells. This protein plays a significant role in the cleavage and polyadenylation of pre-mRNA, processes that are vital for mRNA maturation, stability, export from the nucleus, and translation (Dubois2019The; Choudhry2023Cleavage). CPSF4 functions by binding to the polyadenylation signal (PAS) sequence AAUAAA, with its zinc finger motifs recognizing specific adenines within this sequence. However, CPSF4 alone binds the PAS poorly and requires the presence of other CPSF components, such as CPSF160 and WDR33, for effective PAS recognition (Liu2024Modulation).

In addition to its role in mRNA processing, CPSF4 is involved in the regulation of alternative polyadenylation, which leads to the production of mRNA isoforms with different 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). This process contributes to the diversity of mRNA and can influence mRNA stability, localization, and translation efficiency (Choudhry2023Cleavage). CPSF4 is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to gene expression regulation and RNA maturation (Dubois2019The).

## Clinical Significance
CPSF4 (cleavage and polyadenylation specific factor 4) has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In lung adenocarcinoma, CPSF4 is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, correlating with poor overall survival and serving as an independent prognostic factor. Its knockdown inhibits cancer cell proliferation and induces apoptosis by affecting signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT and MAPK, suggesting its critical role in cancer cell survival and proliferation (Chen2013Upregulation).

In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), CPSF4 is also highly expressed, with its reduction leading to decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis. This is mediated through the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, indicating CPSF4's role in OSCC pathogenesis and its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2021Overproduced).

In prostate cancer, CPSF4 expression is associated with advanced cancer stages and genetic aberrations like ERG-fusion and SPOP mutations. It is linked to cell cycle dysregulation and metastasis, with knockdown experiments showing reduced cell invasion and migration. These findings suggest CPSF4's involvement in prostate cancer progression and its potential as a biomarker (Choudhry2023Cleavage).

## Interactions
CPSF4, also known as CPSF30, is a key component of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex, which is essential for the 3' end processing of pre-mRNA. Within this complex, CPSF4 interacts with several other subunits, including CPSF1, CPSF2, and CPSF3, to form a stable assembly necessary for effective mRNA processing (Choudhry2023Cleavage). CPSF4 acts as a scaffold protein, facilitating the recognition and binding of pre-mRNA to the cleavage site (Choudhry2023Cleavage).

CPSF4 also interacts with CPSF160 and WDR33, forming a heterodimer that is crucial for the recognition of the polyadenylation signal (AAUAAA) in pre-mRNA. The N-terminal zinc finger domain (ZF1) of CPSF4 is necessary for its interaction with the CPSF160-WDR33 heterodimer, while the ZF4 and ZF5 domains are involved in recruiting Fip1 to the complex (Clerici2017Structural).

In the context of influenza A virus infection, CPSF4 interacts with the viral nonstructural NS1 protein, which inhibits CPSF4's role in mRNA processing and affects host gene expression, including the splicing of TP53 transcripts (Dubois2019The). This interaction is significant in modulating the host's antiviral response and viral replication (Dubois2019The).
