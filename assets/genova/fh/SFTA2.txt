# SFTA2

## Overview
SFTA2 is a gene that encodes the surfactant-associated protein 2, a novel secretory peptide primarily expressed in the lung. This protein is particularly abundant in type II pneumocytes and nonciliated epithelial cells of the terminal bronchiolus, where it is involved in the classical secretory pathway. The SFTA2 protein is characterized by its small size, consisting of 78 amino acids in its primary form, and is N-glycosylated, which may influence its stability and function. Unlike other surfactant proteins, SFTA2 is not hydrophobic and is highly conserved across mammalian species, suggesting a fundamental role in lung physiology. Although its precise function remains to be fully elucidated, SFTA2 is thought to contribute to pulmonary surfactant homeostasis and may play a role in inflammation and defense mechanisms within the lung. Alterations in SFTA2 expression have been associated with lung-related conditions, including non-small-cell lung carcinoma, where it acts as a tumor suppressor gene (Mittal2012SFTA2—A; Li2022Transcriptomic).

## Structure
The SFTA2 protein is a small peptide with a primary translation product comprising 78 amino acids. After the cleavage of a 19 bp signal peptide, the mature form consists of 59 amino acids, with a predicted molecular weight of 6.55 kDa (Mittal2012SFTA2—A). The protein is not hydrophobic, unlike other surfactant proteins such as B or C, and is highly conserved across mammals, including marsupials (Mittal2012SFTA2—A). Two regions of the protein, amino acids 25-33 and 44-66, show particularly high conservation, with a helical structure predicted between amino acids 44 and 55 (Mittal2012SFTA2—A).

SFTA2 is an N-glycosylated protein, with a specific glycosylation site at position 37 in humans, although this site is absent in some other species, which instead have a glycosylation site at a position corresponding to human amino acid 62 (Mittal2012SFTA2—A). In transfected cells, SFTA2 appears as bands at 13 kDa and 6 kDa, with the 13 kDa band representing the glycosylated form (Mittal2012SFTA2—A). The presence of two conserved cysteine residues suggests a disulfide bond between C51 and C76 (Mittal2012SFTA2—A). Despite its conservation, no similarity to known domains shared by other proteins has been identified (Mittal2012SFTA2—A).

## Function
The SFTA2 gene encodes a novel secretory peptide that is highly expressed in the lung, particularly in type II pneumocytes and nonciliated epithelial cells of the terminal bronchiolus (Mittal2012SFTA2—A). This protein is involved in the classical secretory pathway, as indicated by its colocalization with markers for the Golgi apparatus and secretory vesicles (Mittal2012SFTA2—A). SFTA2 is an N-glycosylated protein, which suggests a role in protein stability or function (Mittal2012SFTA2—A). 

In healthy human cells, SFTA2 is thought to play a role in lung physiology, potentially contributing to inflammation and defense mechanisms, as its expression is modulated by inflammatory stimuli such as lipopolysaccharides (Mittal2012SFTA2—A). However, its exact function in healthy cells is not fully elucidated (Mittal2012SFTA2—A). The gene's expression is significantly higher in isolated type II cells compared to whole lung homogenate, indicating its specific activity in these cells (Mittal2012SFTA2—A). The protein's involvement in the lung's secretory processes suggests it may contribute to maintaining pulmonary surfactant homeostasis, which is crucial for reducing surface tension in the alveoli and facilitating efficient gas exchange (Mittal2012SFTA2—A).

## Clinical Significance
The SFTA2 gene has been implicated in various lung-related conditions due to alterations in its expression levels. In non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), SFTA2 is identified as a tumor suppressor gene, with significantly lower expression in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This downregulation is associated with poorer overall survival in NSCLC patients, particularly in lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Li2022Transcriptomic). 

SFTA2 expression is also modulated by inflammatory stimuli, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which downregulates its expression in type II pneumocytes. This response indicates a potential role in lung inflammation and defense mechanisms, although the exact implications for specific diseases are not fully detailed (Mittal2012SFTA2—A). 

The gene's expression is notably higher in the lung compared to other tissues, and it is involved in the classical secretory pathway, suggesting its importance in maintaining lung function. However, no direct link to specific diseases due to mutations or expression level alterations is provided, although its role in lung-specific functions and potential involvement in lung diseases is highlighted (Mittal2012SFTA2—A).
