# ARL8B

## Overview
ARL8B is a gene that encodes the protein ADP ribosylation factor-like GTPase 8B, a member of the small GTPase family. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of lysosomal positioning and trafficking within cells. As a small GTPase, ARL8B plays a pivotal role in the bidirectional movement of lysosomes along microtubules, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and facilitating processes such as autophagy and immune responses (RosaFerreira2011Arl8; JonesJamtgaard2019Hepatitis). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as the HOPS complex and kinesin-1, underscore its importance in membrane trafficking and lysosomal exocytosis (Wu2020Lysosomal; Khatter2015The). Additionally, ARL8B has been implicated in pathological conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, where its altered expression and association with amyloid-beta plaques suggest a potential role in disease progression (Boeddrich2023A).

## Function
ARL8B is a small GTPase that plays a critical role in the motility and positioning of lysosomes within healthy human cells. It is constitutively present on mature lysosomes and is involved in their bidirectional movement along microtubules, which is essential for maintaining their intracellular distribution and function (RosaFerreira2011Arl8). ARL8B recruits the protein SKIP to lysosomes, forming a crucial link with kinesin-1, a motor protein that facilitates the movement of lysosomes toward the microtubule plus ends (RosaFerreira2011Arl8). This interaction is necessary for the peripheral accumulation of lysosomes and their outward movement in response to cytosolic acidification, which is significant for cellular behavior in acidic environments (RosaFerreira2011Arl8).

ARL8B's role extends to lysosomal traffic, where it binds to the Vps41 subunit of the HOPS complex, indicating its involvement in membrane trafficking processes (RosaFerreira2011Arl8). The protein is N-terminally acetylated, which is crucial for its localization to lysosomes, and this acetylation stabilizes its membrane association (Hofmann2006An). Through these functions, ARL8B influences cellular processes such as autophagy, immune response, and cellular homeostasis (JonesJamtgaard2019Hepatitis).

## Clinical Significance
The ARL8B gene has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to its role in lysosomal trafficking and its altered expression in disease states. Studies have identified ARL8B as a potential biomarker for AD, with significant upregulation observed in the hippocampal tissues of 5xFAD mouse models and in human AD patient brains (Boeddrich2023A). The protein is associated with the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, a hallmark of AD, and is found to be enriched near these plaques in both mouse models and human brains (Boeddrich2023A).

Increased levels of ARL8B have been detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from AD patients, suggesting its potential as a CSF biomarker for the disease. This increase is specific to AD, as no significant elevation was observed in Huntington's disease patients (Boeddrich2023A). The correlation between ARL8B levels and Aβ42 aggregates, as well as phosphorylated tau (p-tau) protein levels, indicates a link to cognitive impairment in AD (Boeddrich2023A). These findings suggest that ARL8B may play a critical role in the lysosomal network changes observed in AD, contributing to the disease's pathology.

## Interactions
ARL8B, a small GTPase, is involved in lysosomal trafficking through its interactions with various proteins. It directly interacts with the hVps41 subunit of the HOPS complex in a GTP-dependent manner, which is crucial for the recruitment of hVps41 to lysosomes (Khatter2015The). The WD40 domain of hVps41 is essential for this interaction, as its deletion results in a failure to bind ARL8B (Khatter2015The). ARL8B also interacts with SKIP (SifA and kinesin-interacting protein), facilitating the recruitment of kinesin-1 to lysosomes, which promotes their movement towards the cell periphery (Wu2020Lysosomal; Khatter2015The).

In the context of cancer cell invasiveness, ARL8B interacts with SKIP to enhance lysosomal exocytosis and invasiveness, particularly in cells that survive ionizing radiation (Wu2020Lysosomal). The BORC complex, including subunits like BLOS1, BLOS2, and Myrlysin, regulates ARL8B's recruitment to lysosomes and its interaction with SKIP (Wu2020Lysosomal). These interactions are modulated by extracellular stimuli and are associated with increased cancer cell invasiveness and poor prognosis in breast cancer patients (Wu2020Lysosomal).
