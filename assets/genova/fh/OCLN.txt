# OCLN

## Overview
The OCLN gene encodes occludin, a tetraspan transmembrane protein that is integral to the structure and function of tight junctions in epithelial and endothelial cells. Occludin is characterized by its four transmembrane domains, two extracellular loops, and intracellular N- and C-terminal tails, which facilitate its role in maintaining cellular barriers and regulating paracellular permeability (Fredriksson2015Proteomic; Chi2017Fusion). The protein's interactions with other tight junction components, such as ZO-1, and its involvement in various signaling pathways underscore its importance in cellular adhesion and barrier function (Buschmann2013Occludin; Schneeberger2004The). Additionally, occludin plays a role in processes such as angiogenesis, neurogenesis, and viral entry, highlighting its multifaceted biological significance (Kanayasu‐Toyoda2017Occludin; Liu2010The). Mutations in the OCLN gene are linked to severe neurological disorders and renal dysfunction, emphasizing the clinical relevance of this gene in human health (LeBlanc2013A; Jenkinson2017Comprehensive).

## Structure
Occludin (OCLN) is a tetraspan transmembrane protein integral to the structure and function of tight junctions in epithelial and endothelial cells. It features four transmembrane domains, two extracellular loops, and intracellular N- and C-terminal tails (Fredriksson2015Proteomic; Chi2017Fusion). The protein's C-terminal tail includes a 107-amino acid occludin/ELL domain (OCEL), which is crucial for interactions with proteins such as ZO-1, actin, and various kinases, playing a significant role in tight junction targeting and barrier function (Buschmann2013Occludin).

The MARVEL domain, characterized by four transmembrane helices, is essential for occludin's localization to the basolateral membrane and its oligomerization, which is crucial for its function in tight junctions (Yaffe2012The). This domain facilitates self-association and oligomerization through π-stacking interactions of aromatic amino acids, which are vital for maintaining the protein's structural integrity (Yaffe2012The).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, influence occludin's function and localization, particularly its concentration at tight junctions (Fredriksson2015Proteomic). These structural features and modifications underscore occludin's role in maintaining the barrier and fence functions of tight junctions.

## Function
Occludin (OCLN) is a critical component of tight junctions in epithelial and endothelial cells, playing a significant role in maintaining the integrity and selective permeability of these barriers. It is a tetraspan membrane protein with two extracellular loops and cytosolic amino- and carboxy-terminal domains, which are involved in various signaling pathways (Schneeberger2004The). Occludin's phosphorylation state, influenced by kinases such as protein kinase C, affects its localization and function, contributing to the regulation of tight junction barrier function and increasing transepithelial resistance (TER) (Schneeberger2004The).

In endothelial cells, occludin is essential for tube formation and sprouting activities, which are crucial for angiogenesis and vascular development. Its expression correlates with the tube formation ability of endothelial progenitor cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (Kanayasu‐Toyoda2017Occludin). Occludin also plays a role in maintaining centrosomal and mitotic spindle integrity during early brain development, which is vital for proper cell cycle progression and neuronal differentiation (Bendriem2019Tight).

Occludin interacts with proteins like ZO-1, contributing to cell adhesion and acting as a membrane fence to prevent lateral diffusion of lipids (Schneeberger2004The). It is involved in regulating calcium homeostasis and apoptosis in keratinocytes, which is important for preventing tumorigenesis (Rachow2013Occludin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the OCLN gene, which encodes the tight junction protein occludin, are associated with several severe neurological disorders. One such condition is band-like calcification with simplified gyration and polymicrogyria (BLC-PMG), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by early-onset seizures, progressive microcephaly, severe developmental delay, and distinctive patterns of brain calcification (O’Driscoll2010Recessive; Jenkinson2017Comprehensive). Mutations in the OCLN gene, including frameshift, splice site, and nonsense mutations, have been identified in patients with BLC-PMG, leading to disruptions in the protein's function and contributing to the disease's pathogenesis (AbdelHamid2017Bandlike; O’Driscoll2010Recessive).

In addition to neurological disorders, alterations in the OCLN gene have been linked to renal dysfunction. A novel rearrangement involving exon 9 of the OCLN gene has been associated with brain calcification and renal dysfunction, expanding the clinical phenotype beyond cranial defects (LeBlanc2013A). These findings underscore the importance of structural variations in the OCLN gene and their impact on both neurological and renal health. The gene's role in maintaining the integrity of tight junctions is crucial, and its disruption can lead to significant clinical manifestations.

## Interactions
Occludin (OCLN) is a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of tight junctions in epithelial and endothelial cells. It interacts with several other proteins to perform its functions. The OCEL domain of occludin is essential for its interactions with proteins such as ZO-1, actin, and multiple kinases, which are necessary for occludin's proper targeting to tight junctions and the development of barrier function (Buschmann2013Occludin). These interactions are critical for occludin's role in regulating paracellular permeability and maintaining tight junction integrity (Buschmann2013Occludin).

Occludin also interacts with mitotic spindle proteins such as RAN and NuMA, which are crucial for spindle integrity and stability during neurogenesis. This interaction is significant for maintaining mitotic spindle integrity and preventing neurodevelopmental disorders (Bendriem2019Tight).

In the context of viral entry, occludin is involved in the entry of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) into host cells. Although it does not directly bind to the HCV E2 glycoprotein, occludin forms a complex with Dynamin, indicating a potential role in endocytic pathways. The second extracellular loop (EL2) of occludin is crucial for HCV entry, suggesting that occludin may link virions to endocytic pathways (Liu2010The).
