# LGALS7

## Overview
LGALS7 is a gene that encodes the protein galectin-7, a member of the galectin family known for its carbohydrate-binding properties, specifically to β-galactosides. Galectin-7 is categorized as a lectin, a type of protein that binds to specific carbohydrates. It is predominantly expressed in stratified epithelial tissues, such as the epidermis, where it plays a vital role in maintaining epithelial homeostasis by regulating processes like cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (Bernerd1999Galectin7; Advedissian2017Galectin7). The protein is characterized by a conserved carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) and typically forms a homo-dimer, which is essential for its function (Ramaswamy2014Structural; Kamitori2018ThreeDimensional). Galectin-7 is involved in various cellular interactions and signaling pathways, influencing cell adhesion, migration, and immune responses, and has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer and skin disorders (Pinto2023Galectin7; Chen2016Galectin7).

## Structure
Galectin-7, encoded by the LGALS7 gene, is a member of the galectin family characterized by its ability to bind β-galactosides. The primary structure of galectin-7 includes a conserved carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) essential for its binding specificity (Ramaswamy2014Structural). The secondary structure of galectin-7 is composed of β-sheets that form a β-sandwich, a common feature among galectins (Ermakova2013Lactose). 

The tertiary structure of galectin-7 is described as a compact, globular shape, maintaining a 'jelly-roll' fold typical of galectins, except for the first three residues at the N-terminal end (Ramaswamy2014Structural). This structure is stabilized by interactions such as π-π stacking between the galactosyl group and tryptophan residue W69 (Ramaswamy2014Structural).

Galectin-7 typically forms a homo-dimer with a 2-fold symmetry, where the β-sheets of each monomer interact in a back-to-back orientation, creating an interface area of approximately 768 Å² (Kamitori2018ThreeDimensional). This dimerization is crucial for its function and is stabilized by electrostatic interactions, including salt bridges (Ermakova2013Lactose). The protein's dimeric form is further stabilized upon lactose binding, which induces long-range effects and positive cooperativity (Ermakova2013Lactose).

## Function
Galectin-7, encoded by the LGALS7 gene, is a protein primarily expressed in stratified epithelial tissues, such as the epidermis. It plays a crucial role in maintaining epithelial homeostasis by regulating cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, which are essential for epithelial integrity (Advedissian2017Galectin7). Galectin-7 is involved in the apoptotic process, particularly in response to genotoxic stresses like UVB irradiation, where it contributes to the removal of damaged cells, thus maintaining epidermal homeostasis (Bernerd1999Galectin7).

The protein is active in the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells, where it influences intracellular functions rather than interacting with cell surface glycoconjugates (Kuwabara2002Galectin7). Galectin-7 regulates keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation through the JNK-miR-203-p63 signaling pathway, which is crucial for maintaining normal skin function (Chen2016Galectin7). It interacts with JNK1, preventing its degradation and promoting miR-203 expression, which in turn regulates keratinocyte differentiation by modulating the expression of keratin-1 and p63 (Chen2016Galectin7).

Galectin-7 also plays a role in cell adhesion and migration, interacting with E-cadherin to stabilize it at the plasma membrane, which is important for maintaining cell-cell adhesion in the epidermis (Advedissian2017Galectin7). These functions highlight the importance of galectin-7 in maintaining the normal phenotype of epithelial cells and contributing to tissue remodeling processes.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LGALS7 gene, which encodes galectin-7, have been implicated in various cancers and other diseases. In T lymphoma cells, overexpression of galectin-7 promotes tumorigenesis and metastasis by upregulating MMP-9 expression, enhancing the malignant growth and metastatic capacity of these cells (Demers2005A). In breast cancer, galectin-7 is associated with increased invasiveness and resistance to apoptosis, particularly in HER-2 positive cases (Sewgobind2021Functions). Conversely, in prostate cancer, galectin-7 reduces invasiveness and increases sensitivity to apoptosis (Sewgobind2021Functions).

In skin carcinogenesis, galectin-7 expression is upregulated in response to genotoxic and inflammatory insults, such as UVB radiation, and is associated with accelerated tumor development in mouse models (Pinto2023Galectin7). It fosters immunosuppressive myeloid programs within the tumor microenvironment, contributing to skin carcinogenesis (Pinto2023Galectin7).

Galectin-7 also plays a role in placental development, where its administration impairs placental function and is linked to features of preeclampsia in mice (Menkhorst2020Galectin7). In the context of intracerebral hemorrhage, specific polymorphisms in the LGALS7 gene are associated with an increased risk of this condition in certain populations (Wang2022Human).

## Interactions
Galectin-7, encoded by the LGALS7 gene, is involved in various interactions with proteins and potentially nucleic acids, influencing cellular processes. It is known to bind to myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), promoting their immunosuppressive activity by enhancing the secretion of cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-β1, and increasing their inhibitory effect on T-cells (Pinto2023Galectin7). This interaction is mediated through protein-glycan interactions, as evidenced by the prevention of Galectin-7 effects by lactose, a galectin-specific disaccharide (Pinto2023Galectin7).

In the context of skin carcinogenesis, Galectin-7 has been shown to interact with proteins involved in the immune landscape of tumors. It is associated with increased expression of Cxcl1, a chemokine linked to myeloid cell recruitment, and mutations in the c-Met gene, a cancer driver, suggesting a link between c-Met activation and Cxcl1 expression (Pinto2023Galectin7). Additionally, Galectin-7 has been identified as a potential interacting partner of the DNA repair protein PCNA, although no direct impact on nucleotide excision or mismatch repair was observed (Pinto2023Galectin7).

Galectin-7 also participates in an autocrine loop in cancer cells, where extracellular Galectin-7 can enhance its own expression by binding to cell surface glycoreceptors and re-entering cells via endocytosis (BibensLaulan2017Intracellular).
