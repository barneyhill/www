# TRNP1

## Overview
The TRNP1 gene encodes the TMF1-regulated nuclear protein 1, a nuclear protein that plays a pivotal role in brain development and evolution. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of neural progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation, influencing critical processes such as brain size and cortical folding. TRNP1 interacts with chromatin and transcription factors, including CTCF, to modulate gene expression and chromatin architecture, thereby impacting neural stem cell dynamics and cortical development (MartínezMartínez2016A; Kliesmete2021Regulatory). Beyond its developmental roles, TRNP1 has been implicated in pathological conditions, including brain malformations and cancer, where its expression levels can serve as a biomarker for disease prognosis and therapeutic response (Song2022DNA; Tu2023Identification).

## Function
The TRNP1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in brain development by regulating the proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitors. It is involved in the transition from neural stem cells (NSCs) to neural progenitors, influencing brain size and cortical folding, which are essential for proper brain function and development (Kliesmete2021Regulatory). TRNP1 is expressed in the nucleus, where it interacts with chromatin and transcription factors such as CTCF, modulating gene expression and chromatin structure (Kliesmete2021Regulatory).

In the context of cortical development, TRNP1 regulates the production of basal radial glial cells (bRGCs) and intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs) from apical radial glial cells (aRGCs). This regulation is critical for the formation of the outer subventricular zone (OSVZ), which is significant for cortical expansion and folding (MartínezMartínez2016A). The dynamic temporal expression of TRNP1 is essential for controlling the timing and abundance of these progenitor cells, impacting the development of cortical structures and potentially influencing cortical phenotypic diversity in mammals (MartínezMartínez2016A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the TRNP1 gene have been implicated in various conditions related to brain development and cancer. In mammals, TRNP1 is crucial for the expansion and folding of the cerebral cortex, and its dysregulation can lead to significant changes in brain structure. Variations in TRNP1 expression levels are associated with differences in brain size and cortical folding, which may contribute to conditions such as microcephaly and megalencephaly (Kliesmete2021Regulatory).

In the context of cancer, TRNP1 has been studied for its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Elevated expression levels of TRNP1 have been observed in HCC tissues compared to normal tissues, suggesting its involvement in tumorigenesis. TRNP1 is part of a prognostic signature for HCC, indicating its potential as a biomarker for predicting patient outcomes and response to therapies (Song2022DNA; Tu2023Identification). The gene's expression is also linked to DNA methylation patterns and immune landscape in HCC, further highlighting its clinical significance in cancer biology (Song2022DNA; Tu2023Identification).

## Interactions
TRNP1 is involved in various interactions that influence its role in neural development and brain evolution. It interacts with transcription factors such as CTCF, which is known for its insulating properties and role as a transcriptional activator. CTCF's interaction with TRNP1 suggests that TRNP1 may act as a cell-fate determinant downstream of CTCF, affecting the proliferative capacity of neural stem cells (Kliesmete2021Regulatory). The binding strength of CTCF to the intron CRE of TRNP1 can influence TRNP1 expression and the neural stem cell pool, which is crucial for brain size and cortical folding (Kliesmete2021Regulatory).

TRNP1 also interacts with regulatory elements that co-evolve with brain size and cortical folding. These interactions include cis-regulatory elements (CREs) that are active across various mammalian species, indicating a link between TRNP1 activity and cortical phenotypes (Kliesmete2021Regulatory). Additionally, TRNP1's regulatory sequences have been studied using massively parallel reporter assays to assess their activity in neural progenitor cell lines, highlighting its role in gene expression regulation (Kliesmete2021Regulatory). These interactions underscore TRNP1's significance in neural proliferation and differentiation processes.
