# FAM229B

## Overview
FAM229B is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 229 member B. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. FAM229B has been studied in the context of its potential regulatory roles and interactions with other proteins, particularly in disease states such as cancer. The protein encoded by FAM229B is not currently categorized into a specific class such as kinases or receptors, but its expression and regulation have been linked to significant cellular pathways and conditions, including its interaction with DENR and MCTS1, which are implicated in cancer and autism spectrum disorders (Schleich2017Identification). Further research is necessary to clarify the functional roles of FAM229B and its encoded protein in normal physiology and disease (Sun2020CRISPRCas9based).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
FAM229B has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In the context of cancer, FAM229B is identified as a 'borderline' target gene with a predicted down-regulation of 22% upon DENR knockdown, suggesting its regulation is dependent on DENR and MCTS1, which are misexpressed or mutated in conditions like cancer and autism spectrum disorders (Schleich2017Identification). Additionally, FAM229B is mentioned as a potential target gene for miR-192-5p in cervical adenocarcinoma, where it is down-regulated, indicating its involvement in the disease's pathogenesis (Xu2020Transcriptome).

In lung adenocarcinoma, FAM229B is among the top genes positively associated with BEND5, a novel tumor marker, suggesting a potential role in the disease's progression (Ma2023Investigation). Despite these associations, the specific clinical significance of FAM229B in humans remains unclear, as studies have not directly addressed its role in human diseases (Sun2020CRISPRCas9based). Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of FAM229B alterations in disease contexts.
