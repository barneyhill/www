# OR14K1

## Overview
The OR14K1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 14 subfamily K member 1, which is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein is involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the olfactory system by initiating neuronal responses that lead to the perception of smell. As a transmembrane receptor, it spans the cell membrane and transduces extracellular signals through the activation of intracellular G proteins. The olfactory receptor family is one of the largest gene families in the human genome, highlighting the complexity and diversity of the olfactory system. The OR14K1 gene, like other olfactory receptor genes, is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it contributes to the vast repertoire of odorant recognition (Qiu2020aarFDC).
