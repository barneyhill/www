# ZNF862

## Overview
ZNF862 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 862, a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by the presence of C2H2-type zinc finger domains. These domains are typically involved in DNA binding, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation. The protein also contains a Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, which is known for its function in transcriptional repression. Zinc finger protein 862 is implicated in various physiological processes and is ubiquitously expressed across different tissues. It is involved in transcriptional regulation, potentially acting as a transcriptional repressor, and may influence the expression of genes related to fibrotic processes. The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as methylation by protein lysine methyltransferases, which may affect its function and interactions. Mutations in the ZNF862 gene have been associated with several diseases, including hereditary gingival fibromatosis and nuclear age-related cataract, highlighting its clinical significance (Wang2021Four; Wu2022A).

## Structure
ZNF862 encodes a zinc finger protein that is characterized by the presence of C2H2-type zinc finger domains, which are typically involved in DNA binding. These domains are known for their conserved sequence motifs, allowing the protein to interact with various DNA sequences (weirich2017enzymatic). The protein consists of 1169 amino acids and is located on chromosome 7q36.1 (Wu2022A).

The ZNF862 protein includes a Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, which is involved in transcriptional inhibition. This domain is rich in charged amino acids and can be divided into two subfields, A and B, which fold into amphiphilic α helices. The KRAB A subfield is sufficient for transcriptional inhibition, while the B-box enhances this repression (Wang2021Four).

Post-translational modifications of ZNF862 include methylation by the MLL1 protein lysine methyltransferase. The methylation occurs at lysine residue K457, which has been confirmed through mutational analysis (weirich2017enzymatic). This modification may influence the protein's function and interactions, although the specific effects are not fully detailed in the available literature. 

The protein's structure and function are still under investigation, with studies suggesting its involvement in transcriptional regulation and potential roles in various physiological conditions (Wu2022A).

## Function
ZNF862 is a zinc finger protein that is predicted to function as a transcriptional regulator due to its zinc-finger DNA-binding domain. It is suggested to act as a transcriptional repressor, potentially influencing the expression of genes involved in fibrotic processes. In healthy human cells, ZNF862 may normally repress the expression of certain profibrotic genes, thereby maintaining normal tissue structure, particularly in gingival tissues (Wu2022A). The protein is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, indicating its involvement in multiple physiological processes (Wu2022A).

ZNF862 is also a potential non-histone target for methylation by protein lysine methyltransferases such as MLL1 and MLL3. This methylation activity suggests a role in transcriptional regulation, possibly supporting MLL1 in its function (weirich2017enzymatic). The methylation of ZNF862 by MLL1 is notably stronger in the presence of complex partners, indicating its potential physiological relevance (weirich2017enzymatic). However, the precise molecular mechanisms and the specific functions of ZNF862 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated, and further studies are needed to explore its biological roles (weirich2017enzymatic; Wu2022A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZNF862 gene have been implicated in several diseases. A missense variant in ZNF862 is associated with autosomal-dominant hereditary gingival fibromatosis (HGF), a condition characterized by the overgrowth of gingival tissue. This variant is thought to enhance the TGF-β/SMAD1 signaling pathway, leading to increased production of profibrotic factors such as COL1A1, which contributes to the HGF phenotype (Wu2022A). The variant is classified as 'Pathogenic' according to guidelines by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) (Wu2022A).

ZNF862 has also been associated with nuclear age-related cataract (NARC) in Chinese individuals. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs62621204, located in the Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain of ZNF862, has been linked to this condition. Although this SNP is not in the protein-coding region, it may affect the transcriptional inhibition function of the KRAB domain, potentially influencing the development of cataracts (Wang2021Four).

Additionally, ZNF862 has been identified with recurrent stop-gain mutations in the context of microglandular adenosis (MGA) progressing to matrix-producing metaplastic carcinoma (MPMC) in breast lesions, suggesting a potential role in the clonal evolution of these lesions (Schwartz2019Microglandular).
