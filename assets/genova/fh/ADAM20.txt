# ADAM20

## Overview
ADAM20 is a gene that encodes the ADAM metallopeptidase domain 20, a member of the ADAM (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase) family of proteins. These proteins are characterized by their transmembrane nature and involvement in a variety of biological processes, including proteolysis, cell adhesion, and cell signaling. The ADAM20 protein is predominantly expressed in the testis, indicating its potential role in reproductive functions such as spermatogenesis and sperm function (Stone1999Structure–Function; EDWARDS2008The). Structurally, ADAM20 contains a metalloprotease domain that facilitates the cleavage of transmembrane proteins, as well as a disintegrin domain that mediates cell adhesion through interactions with integrins (Stone1999Structure–Function; Mullooly2016The). The evolutionary conservation of ADAM20, particularly its homology with mouse Adam1, suggests a conserved function in sperm-egg cell fusion (Brocker2009Evolutionary).

## Function
ADAM20 is a member of the ADAM (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase) family, which are transmembrane proteins involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, cell adhesion, and cell signaling. In healthy human cells, ADAM20 is predominantly expressed in the testis, suggesting a significant role in reproductive processes, particularly in spermatogenesis and sperm function (Stone1999Structure–Function; EDWARDS2008The). The protein shares a high degree of homology with mouse Adam1, which is involved in sperm-egg cell fusion, indicating a potential similar function for ADAM20 in humans (Brocker2009Evolutionary).

The structure of ADAM20 includes a metalloprotease domain, which is responsible for its proteolytic activity. This domain allows ADAM20 to cleave type I and II transmembrane proteins, including precursor forms of cytokines and growth factors, which are crucial for cellular interactions and signaling pathways (Mullooly2016The). The disintegrin domain of ADAM20 is involved in cell adhesion, interacting with integrins to facilitate cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, which are essential for processes like cell migration and fusion (Stone1999Structure–Function).
