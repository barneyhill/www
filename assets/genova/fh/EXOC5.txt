# EXOC5

## Overview
EXOC5 is a gene that encodes the protein exocyst complex component 5, which is a crucial part of the exocyst complex, an octameric protein assembly involved in vesicle trafficking and exocytosis. The exocyst complex plays a pivotal role in tethering vesicles to the plasma membrane, facilitating the fusion necessary for the secretion of proteins and the delivery of membrane proteins to the cell surface. EXOC5, specifically, is integral to the constitutive secretory pathway in mammalian cells, where it ensures the efficient delivery of cargoes to the cell surface. The protein is also involved in various cellular processes, including insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle cells and the maintenance of auditory and visual functions. Additionally, EXOC5 interacts with small GTPases and other exocyst components, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular trafficking and signaling pathways (Halim2023The; Lee2018Exocyst; Pereira2022The).

## Function
EXOC5 is a critical component of the exocyst complex, an octameric protein complex involved in the tethering of vesicles to the plasma membrane, facilitating exocytosis. This process is essential for various cellular functions, including the secretion of proteins and the delivery of membrane proteins to the cell surface. In mammalian cells, EXOC5 plays a vital role in the constitutive secretory pathway, where it is necessary for the fusion of post-Golgi carriers with the plasma membrane. The absence of EXOC5 significantly reduces the delivery of cargoes to the cell surface, highlighting its importance in maintaining efficient secretion processes (Pereira2022The).

In skeletal muscle cells, EXOC5 is involved in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by facilitating the docking of GLUT4 storage vesicles to the plasma membrane. This function is crucial for glucose homeostasis, as EXOC5 knockout disrupts insulin-induced glucose uptake (Fujimoto2019The). EXOC5 is also essential for the survival and function of hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons in the cochlea, where its deficiency leads to progressive hearing loss due to the degeneration of these cells (Lee2018Exocyst).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the EXOC5 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In the inner ear, EXOC5 is crucial for the survival of hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons, which are essential for hearing. Deficiency in EXOC5 leads to progressive sensorineural hearing loss due to degeneration of stereocilia and apoptotic hair cell loss (Lee2018Exocyst). In the eye, EXOC5 is vital for the health of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and photoreceptor cells. Loss of EXOC5 in the RPE results in dysfunction, photoreceptor degeneration, and decreased visual function, highlighting its role in maintaining visual health (Rohrer2021Conditional).

EXOC5 is also implicated in cardiac development. Mutations in EXOC5 have been associated with bicuspid aortic valve disease and aortic stenosis, conditions linked to defects in the exocyst-cilia machinery. These mutations can impair ciliogenesis, leading to developmental abnormalities in the heart (Fulmer2019Defects). The gene's role in these diverse conditions underscores its importance in various organ systems and its potential involvement in ciliopathies.

## Interactions
EXOC5, a central component of the exocyst complex, participates in various protein interactions essential for its function in vesicle trafficking and cellular processes. It interacts with other exocyst components, including EXOC1-EXOC8, forming a complex crucial for tethering post-Golgi vesicles to the plasma membrane (Halim2023The). EXOC5 specifically forms part of subcomplex II, which includes Sec10 (EXOC5), Sec15, Exo70, and Exo84, and is involved in the spatial and temporal regulation of SNARE complex assembly for vesicle fusion (Halim2023The).

EXOC5 also interacts with small GTPases such as Cdc42 and Rab8, which are important for targeting vesicles to the plasma membrane and are involved in processes like ciliogenesis (Lee2018Exocyst). In renal tubule epithelial cells, Cdc42 interacts with EXOC5 to target vesicles carrying ciliary proteins to the primary cilium (Lee2018Exocyst). Additionally, EXOC5 is involved in interactions with RAL GTPases, particularly through interactions with Sec5 and Exo84, which are important for exocyst assembly and function in exocytosis (Halim2023The).

In the context of podocyte function, EXOC5 is involved in the trafficking of slit diaphragm proteins Neph1 and Nephrin, crucial for maintaining podocyte structure and function (Nihalani2019Disruption). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of EXOC5 in cellular trafficking and signaling pathways.
