# APOM

## Overview
The APOM gene encodes apolipoprotein M, a member of the lipocalin protein family, which is primarily associated with high-density lipoproteins (HDL) in human plasma. Apolipoprotein M is characterized by its lipocalin fold structure, which includes an eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel that facilitates the binding of various lipophilic ligands. This protein plays a significant role in lipid metabolism, particularly in the biogenesis and remodeling of HDL particles, and is involved in the transport and metabolism of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a critical lipid signaling molecule. Apolipoprotein M is secreted by the liver and kidney and is implicated in several physiological processes, including cholesterol efflux and protection against oxidative stress, which contribute to its anti-atherogenic properties. The gene's expression is regulated by multiple transcription factors, and its polymorphisms are associated with various metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Mosialou2010Regulation; HUANG2015Apolipoprotein; Christoffersen2006Apolipoprotein).

## Structure
Apolipoprotein M (APOM) is a protein primarily associated with high-density lipoproteins (HDL) and is a member of the lipocalin protein family. The molecular structure of APOM is characterized by a typical lipocalin fold, which includes an eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel that encloses an internal ligand-binding pocket. This β-barrel is flanked by an α-helix, known as helix-A1, and is linked by seven loops, six of which form β-hairpins (Sevvana2009Serendipitous).

APOM contains three disulfide bridges that contribute to its structural stability: one links the N-terminal cysteine Cys23 to Cys167 in helix A1, another links the C-terminal cysteine Cys183 to Cys95 in β-strand D, and a third is between Cys128 on loop L6 and Cys157 on helix A1 (Sevvana2009Serendipitous). The protein also retains its hydrophobic N-terminal signal peptide, which acts as a lipid anchor, attaching it to lipoproteins (Sevvana2009Serendipitous; Christoffersen2008The).

APOM can be glycosylated at Asn135, resulting in both glycosylated and non-glycosylated forms (Christoffersen2008The). The protein's structure allows it to bind various ligands, including fatty acids and sphingosine-1-phosphate, with the binding pocket's structure accommodating different ligands (Sevvana2009Serendipitous). The physiological role of APOM is not fully understood, but it is suggested to have antiatherogenic properties (Sevvana2009Serendipitous).

## Function
Apolipoprotein M (ApoM) is a 26-kDa glycoprotein primarily associated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in human plasma, with smaller amounts found in low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TGRLP) (Xu1999A; Luo2004ApolipoproteinM). ApoM is involved in the biogenesis and metabolism of HDL particles, playing a crucial role in HDL maturation and remodeling (Mosialou2010Regulation; Mosialou2011Opposite). It is secreted by the liver and kidney, where it participates in recycling small lipophilic ligands via the receptor megalin (Mosialou2010Regulation).

ApoM-containing HDL particles are more resistant to oxidation and are more efficient in protecting against LDL oxidation and stimulating cholesterol efflux from macrophage foam cells (Mosialou2010Regulation; Christoffersen2006Apolipoprotein). This function is significant in preventing atherosclerosis, as ApoM has been shown to have anti-atherogenic properties (Christoffersen2006Apolipoprotein). ApoM is also involved in the metabolism of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a lipid signaling molecule, indicating its role in S1P transport and metabolism (HUANG2015Apolipoprotein). The protein's expression is regulated by various factors, including transcription factors such as HNF-1α, LRH-1, and FOXA2, which influence its role in lipid metabolism and HDL levels (Mosialou2010Regulation; Luo2004ApolipoproteinM).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the APOM gene are linked to several diseases and conditions. Polymorphisms in the APOM gene, such as T-778C, are associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and higher cholesterol levels (HUANG2015Apolipoprotein). In diabetes, APOM is implicated in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes susceptibility, with reduced expression levels observed in some patients and animal models (Mosialou2010Regulation). The gene's polymorphisms, including rs707922 and rs805297, are associated with metabolic traits in type 2 diabetes, such as elevated total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels (Zhou2011Apolipoprotein).

APOM is also involved in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), particularly emphysema, through its effects on HDL levels and endothelial cell integrity (Burkart2013APOM). In obesity, APOM levels correlate with leptin levels and are influenced by leptin treatment, suggesting a role in metabolic regulation (HUANG2015Apolipoprotein). The APOM/S1P axis is significant in lipid metabolism and inflammatory diseases, with genetic variations linked to coronary artery disease and rheumatoid arthritis (Borup2015Apolipoprotein). These findings highlight APOM's complex role in various metabolic and cardiovascular conditions.

## Interactions
Apolipoprotein M (APOM) is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It has been identified as a novel protein associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) particles. APOM physically associates with HCV core protein and RNA, as demonstrated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and immunoprecipitation tests. These tests showed that anti-APOM antibodies could immunoprecipitate HCV RNA and the E2 protein from cell culture supernatants and human serum samples (Cai2020Apolipoprotein). APOM directly interacts with the HCV E2 protein, but not with other HCV proteins such as Core, NS2, NS5A, or NS4B. The domain responsible for this interaction is located between amino acids 76-105 of APOM (Cai2020Apolipoprotein).

APOM also plays a role in lipid metabolism by binding to sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) within high-density lipoproteins (HDL). This interaction is crucial for activating the S1P1 receptor on endothelial cells, which contributes to vascular integrity and protection (Christoffersen2011Endotheliumprotective). APOM's binding to oxidized phospholipids enhances the antioxidant effect of HDL, indicating its involvement in reducing lipid oxidation (Elsøe2012Apolipoprotein). These interactions highlight APOM's multifaceted role in both viral processes and lipid metabolism.
