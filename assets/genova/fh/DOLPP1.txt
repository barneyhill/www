# DOLPP1

## Overview
DOLPP1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme dolichyldiphosphatase 1, which is integral to the glycosylation process in eukaryotic cells. This enzyme is categorized as a transmembrane protein due to its structure, which includes four putative transmembrane domains. Dolichyldiphosphatase 1 is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it catalyzes the dephosphorylation of dolichyl pyrophosphate to dolichyl phosphate. This reaction is essential for recycling dolichol phosphate, a lipid carrier molecule necessary for the biosynthesis of lipid-linked oligosaccharides, which are critical for protein glycosylation. The DOLPP1 gene is evolutionarily conserved, sharing homology with the yeast CWH8 gene, underscoring its fundamental role in cellular processes (Buczkowska2014Genetic; Cantagrel2011From).

## Function
DOLPP1 (dolichyldiphosphatase 1) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the recycling of dolichol phosphate (Dol-P) within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of eukaryotic cells. It catalyzes the dephosphorylation of dolichyl pyrophosphate (Dol-P-P) to dolichyl phosphate (Dol-P), a crucial step in the glycosylation process. This reaction is essential for maintaining the pool of Dol-P available for lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) biosynthesis, which is necessary for proper protein glycosylation (Buczkowska2014Genetic; Cantagrel2011From).

The DOLPP1 gene in humans is the ortholog of the yeast CWH8 gene, and its function has been conserved through evolution. The enzyme is composed of 238 amino acids and contains four putative transmembrane domains, with the N- and C-termini predicted to be on the cytosolic face of the ER, while the catalytic domain is on the luminal face (Buczkowska2014Genetic). This localization is crucial for its role in the ER, where it facilitates the recycling of Dol-P, allowing it to return to the cytoplasmic leaflet of the ER for new rounds of glycosylation (Cantagrel2011From). This recycling process is vital for maintaining adequate cellular concentrations of Dol-P, ensuring efficient protein N-glycosylation (Buczkowska2014Genetic).
