# SNRNP48

## Overview
SNRNP48 is a gene that encodes the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein U11/U12 subunit 48, a protein integral to the minor spliceosome complex. This protein is involved in the splicing of U12-type introns, which are less prevalent than U2-type introns in eukaryotic cells. The SNRNP48 protein is characterized by its zinc finger domain and Sm binding domain, which facilitate its interaction with the U11 snRNP complex, contributing to the specificity and stability of the spliceosome's association with the 5' splice site. Through these interactions, SNRNP48 plays a critical role in the early stages of prespliceosome assembly and the precise regulation of gene expression (Turunen2008The; Zhao2023Structure).

## Structure
The SNRNP48 protein is a component of the U11 snRNP complex within the minor spliceosome, playing a crucial role in the recognition and processing of U12-dependent introns. Structurally, SNRNP48 contains a zinc finger domain that binds to the minor groove of the U11 SL4, which is essential for stabilizing the U11/5' splice site helix (Turunen2012The; Zhao2023Structure). The protein also features an Sm binding domain that interacts with the Sm ring, and its C-terminal helix is positioned near the 5'-end of the U11 snRNA, interacting with SmE (Zhao2023Structure).

SNRNP48 forms multiple interfaces within the U11 snRNP complex, contributing to its elongated, two-lobe architecture. It is part of the second lobe, which includes the Sm ring and the 3'-end of the U11 snRNA, and is connected to the first lobe by extended alpha-helices of PDCD7 (Zhao2023Structure). The N-terminal extension of PDCD7 forms a three-helix bundle with SNRNP48, facilitating its binding to the U11 snRNP (Zhao2023Structure). These structural features suggest that SNRNP48 plays a significant role in the specificity of U11 snRNP association and potentially in 5' splice site recognition (Zhao2023Structure).

## Function
SNRNP48, also known as the U11-48K protein, is a crucial component of the minor spliceosome, specifically involved in the splicing of U12-type introns. This protein plays a significant role in the early stages of prespliceosome assembly by interacting with the 5' splice site (5'SS) of U12-type introns in a sequence-specific manner. This interaction is essential for the recognition and removal of these introns, which are less common than U2-type introns in eukaryotic cells (Turunen2008The).

SNRNP48 is recruited to the U11 snRNP by PDCD7 and interacts with various components, including the U11-59K protein, contributing to the stability and formation of the U11/U12 di-snRNP complex. This complex is vital for the proper splicing of U12-type introns, and its disruption can lead to impaired splicing and activation of cryptic splice sites, affecting cell growth and function (Turunen2008The; Zhao2023Structure).

The protein is active in the nucleus, where it stabilizes the interaction between U11 snRNP and the 5'SS, facilitating the precise regulation of gene expression necessary for normal cellular and organismal function (Turunen2008The; Zhao2023Structure).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
SNRNP48, a component of the U11/U12 di-snRNP complex, plays a crucial role in the minor spliceosome by interacting with various proteins and nucleic acids. It is recruited to the U11 snRNP by PDCD7 and interacts with several components within the complex. The zinc finger domain of SNRNP48 binds to the minor groove of the U11 SL4, while its Sm binding domain interacts with the side of the Sm ring. The C-terminal helix of SNRNP48 also interacts with SmE near the 5'-end of U11 snRNA, suggesting its role in the specificity of U11 snRNP association (Zhao2023Structure).

SNRNP48 is positioned near the 5'-end of U11 snRNA and has been shown to interact with the 5' splice site (5'SS) through site-specific cross-linking, indicating its involvement in 5'SS recognition (Zhao2023Structure). It shares a binding site with Luc7, although their different architectures suggest they do not act similarly (Zhao2023Structure). SNRNP48 is also noted to interact with U11-59K (PDCD7), U11/U12-20K (ZMAT5), and U11-35K (SNRNP35), highlighting its role in the assembly and function of the spliceosomal machinery (Norppa2023Distinct).
