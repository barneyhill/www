# EML4

## Overview
EML4 (Echinoderm Microtubule-Associated Protein-Like 4) is a gene that encodes a microtubule-associated protein involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics, which are crucial for cellular processes such as cell division and intracellular trafficking. The EML4 protein is characterized by its structural domains, including a coiled-coil region, a serine/threonine-rich linker, and a C-terminal region with hydrophobic EMAP-like protein (HELP) and WD repeats, which facilitate its role in microtubule stabilization and interaction with other proteins (Bayliss2016Molecular; Fry2016EML). EML4 is particularly significant in the context of cancer biology due to its involvement in the EML4-ALK fusion, a genetic alteration associated with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which results in an oncogenic fusion protein with constitutive kinase activity (Wong2009The; Li2013Clinical). This fusion is a target for specific ALK inhibitors, making EML4 a critical focus in cancer research and treatment strategies (Li2013Clinical).

## Structure
The EML4 protein is part of the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein (EMAP)-like family and is characterized by several distinct structural domains. The primary structure of EML4 includes an N-terminal coiled-coil region, a linker region rich in serine, threonine, and basic residues, and a C-terminal region with hydrophobic EMAP-like protein (HELP) and tryptophan-aspartic acid (WD) repeats (Bayliss2016Molecular; Lei2022EML4‑ALK).

The secondary structure features a trimeric self-association in the coiled-coil region, known as the trimerization domain (TD), which is crucial for the protein's function and oncogenic potential (Richards2015Microtubule). The tertiary structure includes a tandem atypical propeller (TAPE) domain, consisting of two β-propellers formed from WD40 repeats, although the C-terminal propeller includes a blade unrelated to WD40 repeats (Bayliss2016Molecular; Fry2016EML).

In terms of quaternary structure, EML4 can form trimeric structures, potentially assembling into both homotrimers and heterotrimers with other EML proteins (Fry2016EML). The protein is involved in microtubule binding and regulation, with the basic region and TD necessary for microtubule association (Bayliss2016Molecular). EML4 is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may regulate its microtubule affinity (Fry2016EML).

## Function
EML4 (EMAP like 4) is a microtubule-associated protein that plays a critical role in the regulation of microtubule dynamics, which are essential for various cellular processes such as cell division, intracellular trafficking, and maintaining cell shape. In healthy human cells, EML4 functions primarily by stabilizing microtubules during interphase, contributing to the formation and maintenance of the microtubule network (Fry2016EML; Adib2019Mitotic).

During mitosis, EML4 is involved in the reorganization of the microtubule network, facilitating the assembly of the mitotic spindle necessary for chromosome segregation. This process is regulated by phosphorylation through NEK6 and NEK7 kinases, which reduces EML4's affinity for microtubules, allowing for the dynamic changes required during mitosis (Adib2019Mitotic). The phosphorylation of EML4 at specific serine residues is crucial for efficient chromosome congression and anaphase onset (Adib2019Mitotic).

Structurally, EML4 contains an N-terminal domain with a coiled-coil motif and a C-terminal domain with WD repeats, forming a trimerization domain and a TAPE domain, respectively. These domains enable EML4 to bind both polymerized microtubules and soluble tubulin heterodimers, similar to the chTOG/XMAP215 family of microtubule polymerases (Fry2016EML; Adib2019Mitotic). EML4's activity is crucial for proper mitotic progression and cell cycle regulation, highlighting its importance in cellular and organismal functions (Adib2019Mitotic).

## Clinical Significance
The EML4 gene is clinically significant due to its involvement in the EML4-ALK fusion, a genetic alteration found in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This fusion results from a chromosomal rearrangement that combines parts of the EML4 and ALK genes, creating an oncogenic fusion protein with constitutive kinase activity. The EML4-ALK fusion is particularly prevalent in adenocarcinomas and is more common in nonsmokers and younger patients (Wong2009The; Li2013Clinical). It is mutually exclusive with EGFR and KRAS mutations, indicating a distinct molecular subset of NSCLC (Wong2009The; Li2013Clinical).

The presence of the EML4-ALK fusion gene is associated with specific histological patterns in NSCLC, such as papillary, acinar, and solid growth patterns, and is often found in tumors with a solid signet-ring cell or mucinous cribriform pattern (Li2013Clinical). Patients with this fusion typically do not respond to EGFR-TKI treatments but may benefit from ALK inhibitors, highlighting the importance of screening for EML4-ALK translocation before treatment (Li2013Clinical). The fusion gene's transforming activity has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo, underscoring its role in NSCLC pathogenesis (Choi2008Identification).

## Interactions
EML4 (EMAP like 4) is a microtubule-associated protein that participates in various protein interactions, influencing cell morphology and migration. EML4 interacts with NEK9 and NEK7, kinases involved in microtubule dynamics. This interaction is crucial for microtubule-dependent changes in cell morphology and migration, as demonstrated by the co-precipitation of YFP-EML4 with an activated NEK9 mutant (O’Regan2020EML4–ALK). EML4 can bind to the isolated N-terminal domain (NTD) of NEK9, and this interaction is significant in the context of EML4-ALK fusion variants, particularly V3 and V5, which promote microtubule stabilization and cell migration (O’Regan2020EML4–ALK).

EML4 also forms part of a complex with NEK6 and NEK7, where phosphorylation by these kinases during mitosis reduces its affinity for microtubules, affecting spindle dynamics and chromosome congression (Adib2018Mitotic). In the context of cancer, EML4-ALK fusion proteins interact with several signaling proteins, including SHC1, GRB2, and PIK3R2, which are involved in pathways such as MAPK. These interactions are critical for the oncogenic activity of EML4-ALK in lung cancer (Zhang2016Coupling). The EML4-ALK interactome includes a network of 464 proteins, highlighting its extensive role in cellular signaling and potential drug targeting (Zhang2016Coupling).
