# CSH2

## Overview
The CSH2 gene encodes the protein chorionic somatomammotropin hormone 2, which is a member of the somatotropin/prolactin family of hormones. This protein is primarily expressed in the placenta and plays a crucial role in modulating maternal metabolism to support fetal growth and development during pregnancy. It is involved in processes such as insulin resistance, lipolysis, and protein synthesis, thereby enhancing nutrient availability for the fetus. CSH2 is part of a gene cluster that includes other placental genes like CSH1 and GH2, which are essential for regulating fetal glucose supply and maternal metabolism. The protein is secreted into both maternal and fetal circulations, facilitating communication and nutrient transfer between the mother and the fetus. Despite its significant role, a complete deficiency of CSH2 does not necessarily result in major clinical disorders, suggesting the presence of compensatory mechanisms within the gene family (Sedman2008Complex).

## Function
The CSH2 gene encodes a protein known as chorionic somatomammotropin hormone 2, which plays a significant role in regulating growth and development during pregnancy. This protein is primarily expressed in the placenta and is involved in modulating maternal metabolism to support fetal growth. It influences insulin resistance, lipolysis, and protein synthesis, thereby contributing to nutrient availability for the developing fetus (Sedman2008Complex).

CSH2 is part of a gene cluster that includes other placental genes such as CSH1 and GH2, which are crucial for regulating fetal glucose supply, growth, and maternal metabolism (Sedman2008Complex). The protein is secreted into both maternal and fetal circulations, indicating its role in facilitating communication and nutrient transfer between the mother and the fetus (Sedman2008Complex).

The gene exhibits significant genetic diversity and is subject to various selective pressures, which may influence its function and expression patterns across different populations (Sedman2008Complex). Despite its critical role in fetal development, a complete deficiency of CSH2 does not necessarily lead to major clinical disorders, suggesting potential compensatory mechanisms within the gene family (Sedman2008Complex).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CSH2 gene have been associated with several pregnancy-related complications. In cases of pre-eclampsia (PE), there is a trend of reduced expression of the hGH/CSH gene cluster, which includes CSH2. This reduction in expression is similar to that observed in pregnancies resulting in small-for-gestational-age (SGA) newborns, suggesting a potential role in the pathophysiology of PE (Männik2012Differential). In gestational diabetes mellitus (GD), differential expression of the hGH/CSH genes, including CSH2, has been noted, particularly in pregnancies with large-for-gestational-age (LGA) newborns, indicating that altered expression may influence fetal growth and maternal metabolism (Männik2012Differential).

The genetic diversity of CSH2, with significant structuring among populations, suggests that regional population-specific selection may influence its expression. However, specific clinical conditions directly linked to mutations or alterations in CSH2 expression are not detailed (Sedman2008Complex). Despite the association of lower CSH levels with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), a complete deficiency of CSH2 does not necessarily lead to major clinical disorders, indicating a complex relationship between CSH2 expression and clinical outcomes (Sedman2008Complex).
