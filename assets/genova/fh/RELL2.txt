# RELL2

## Overview
The RELL2 gene encodes a type I transmembrane protein that is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF). This protein, known as RELT like 2, is involved in various cellular processes, particularly within the immune system, and is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic tissues and immune-privileged sites. RELL2 shares homology with other members of the RELT family, such as RELT and RELL1, and is characterized by its ability to interact with several proteins, including TRAF2 and the kinase OSR1, which phosphorylates RELL2. These interactions suggest a role in modulating signaling pathways related to apoptosis and cellular stress responses. The protein's expression and function are influenced by alternative splicing and post-transcriptional modifications, impacting its potential anti-tumorigenic activities. RELL2 has been implicated in various cancers, where its expression levels and interactions play significant roles in disease progression and prognosis (Cusick2023The).

## Structure
The RELL2 protein is a Type I transmembrane protein composed of 303 amino acids, with a molecular weight of 32.4 kDa (Cusick2023The). It is part of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF) and shares homology with other members of the RELT family, including RELT and RELL1. RELL2 exhibits 40% amino acid identity with RELL1 and 27% with RELT, with the strongest homology observed in their transmembrane intracellular domains (Cusick2023The).

The protein is predicted to have disordered sequences in its carboxy-terminal tail, which may allow it to adopt multiple conformations depending on post-translational modifications or interactions with other proteins (Cusick2023The). Unlike other TNFRSF members, RELL2 lacks extracellular Cys-rich domains for binding TNFSF ligands (Cusick2023The).

RELL2 can interact with other RELT family members, though it is unclear if it functions as part of a trimeric complex or independently (Cusick2023The). Known protein binding partners include PLSCR1, MDFIC, OXSR1, and SPAK, suggesting potential roles in various signaling pathways (Cusick2023The). The protein's expression and function are influenced by alternative splicing and post-transcriptional modifications, which can impact its anti-tumorigenic activities (Cusick2023The).

## Function
RELL2 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly within the immune system. The RELL2 protein is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic tissues such as the thymus and spleen, as well as in immune-privileged sites like the brain and testes (Cusick2023The). It is a type I transmembrane protein, suggesting its activity is associated with the cell membrane, where it may participate in signaling pathways (Cusick2023The).

RELL2 is known to interact with other members of the RELT family, such as RELT and RELL1, and is involved in modulating signaling pathways. These interactions are crucial for cellular processes like apoptosis, where RELL2 can induce cell death when overexpressed (Cusick2023The). The protein also binds to TRAF2, a factor involved in TNF receptor-associated signaling, indicating its role in immune response regulation (Cusick2023The).

In terms of molecular activity, RELL2 is phosphorylated by the kinase OSR1, which is involved in cellular stress responses and ion homeostasis (Cusick2006Identification). This phosphorylation suggests a role for RELL2 in cellular signaling related to stress and survival mechanisms. However, the specific functions of RELL2 in healthy human cells remain less clearly defined.

## Clinical Significance
The RELL2 gene has been implicated in various cancers, with its expression levels and interactions playing significant roles in disease progression and prognosis. In breast cancer, RELL2 acts as a suppressor of cell migration and invasion. Alterations in its expression, particularly through microRNA-18a, are associated with changes in metastatic potential. The compound polyphyllin VI (PP-VI) has been shown to increase RELL2 expression, thereby reducing breast cancer cell migration and invasion (Cusick2023The; Wang2019Targeted).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), RELL2 is associated with increased sensitivity to chemotherapy and better patient outcomes. The splicing factor DHX38 regulates RELL2 expression by influencing intron retention, which is linked to chemoresistance. Overexpression of RELL2 is correlated with an anti-oncogenic role in PDAC, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Cusick2023The; Li2023DHX38).

RELL2 is also expressed at higher levels in several other cancers, such as rectum adenocarcinoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, where it is associated with poor outcomes. Its expression correlates with advanced cancer stages and higher tumor mutational burden (Cusick2023The).

## Interactions
RELL2, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family, engages in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function. It physically interacts with other members of the RELT family, including RELT and RELL1, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. These interactions suggest that RELL2 can form complexes with these proteins at the plasma membrane (Cusick2006Identification).

RELL2 also interacts with the kinase OSR1, which phosphorylates RELL2 and other RELT family members. This interaction is facilitated by a specific motif present in RELL2, which is crucial for its phosphorylation and subsequent cellular processes (Cusick2006Identification).

In addition to these interactions, RELL2 binds to the hematopoietic transcription factor MDFIC. This interaction is specific and occurs at the plasma membrane, as confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Cusick2020RELT).

RELL2 is unique among its family members in its ability to bind TRAF2, a signaling molecule involved in apoptosis. This interaction suggests that RELL2 may participate in distinct signaling pathways compared to other RELT family proteins (Cusick2023The).
