# SLC35E3

## Overview
SLC35E3 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 35 member E3, which is part of the drug/metabolite transporter protein superfamily. This protein is involved in the transmembrane transport of carbohydrate derivatives, playing a crucial role in glycol-conjugation processes within the Golgi complex and/or the endoplasmic reticulum (Gao2018SLC35E3; Shivakumar2017Identification). SLC35E3 is implicated in the transport of UDP-glucuronic acid, influencing UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity in specific cell types, although its role in the human liver appears to be minor (Ondo2020SLC35B1). The gene's expression and regulation have been linked to various diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular disease, highlighting its potential significance in clinical contexts (Gao2018SLC35E3; Shivakumar2017Identification). Additionally, genetic rearrangements involving SLC35E3, such as fusions with YEATS4, have been observed in certain cancers, suggesting a role in cancer biology (Still2018YEATS4).

## Function
SLC35E3 is a member of the solute carrier family involved in the transport of carbohydrate derivatives, specifically within the biological process of glycol-conjugation in the Golgi complex and/or the endoplasmic reticulum (Gao2018SLC35E3). It is part of the drug/metabolite transporter protein superfamily and plays a role in transmembrane transport (Shivakumar2017Identification). In the context of UDP-glucuronic acid (UDPGA) transport, SLC35E3 has been shown to affect UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) activity in certain cell types. Knockdown of SLC35E3 in HEK/UGT1A1 cells resulted in decreased 4-MU glucuronosyltransferase activity, indicating its involvement in UDPGA transport and modulation of UGT1A activity. However, in HepaRG cells, SLC35E3 knockdown did not affect glucuronosyltransferase activity, suggesting a minor role in UDPGA transport in the human liver (Ondo2020SLC35B1). The gene is also implicated in carbohydrate derivative transport, contributing to normal cellular processes and potentially influencing metabolic functions (Gao2018SLC35E3). While its specific function in healthy human cells is not fully elucidated, SLC35E3 is believed to play a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and metabolic functions.

## Clinical Significance
SLC35E3 has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In bladder cancer, the gene is known as Bladder Cancer-Overexpressed gene 1 (BLOV1). Lowered expression of SLC35E3, influenced by miRNA targeting and DNA methylation, is associated with better survival outcomes. This suggests that epigenetic control of SLC35E3 plays a significant role in bladder cancer prognosis (Shivakumar2017Identification).

In cardiovascular disease (CVD), SLC35E3 is identified as a target of the novel miRNA m1061-5p. This interaction may repress SLC35E3 expression, potentially affecting glycol-conjugation processes in the Golgi complex and/or the endoplasmic reticulum. The repression of SLC35E3 by miRNA could serve as a marker for prognosis or a target for treatment in CVD (Gao2018SLC35E3).

Additionally, SLC35E3 is involved in genetic rearrangements in certain cancers. In lung adenocarcinomas and glioblastoma, a fusion between YEATS4 and SLC35E3 has been observed, suggesting a potential role in cancer biology, although the clinical significance of this fusion remains unclear (Still2018YEATS4).
