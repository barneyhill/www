# S100A6

## Overview
S100A6 is a gene that encodes the S100 calcium-binding protein A6, also known as calcyclin, which is a member of the S100 protein family. This family is characterized by the presence of EF-hand calcium-binding motifs, which are crucial for the protein's role as a calcium sensor. The S100A6 protein is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including calcium signaling, cell proliferation, differentiation, and cytoskeletal dynamics. It is predominantly expressed in epithelial cells and fibroblasts and can be found in the cytoplasm, nucleus, and associated with the plasma membrane and nuclear envelope. S100A6 interacts with a wide range of proteins in a calcium-dependent manner, influencing cellular homeostasis and stress responses. Clinically, the gene's expression is altered in several diseases, including glioma and Alzheimer's disease, where it may serve as a potential biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis (Leśniak2023S100A6; Hong2023S100A6; Filipek2020S100A6).

## Structure
The S100A6 protein, also known as calcyclin, is a member of the S100 protein family characterized by its EF-hand calcium-binding motifs. The primary structure of S100A6 consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its functional properties (Lee2008Structure). The secondary structure includes alpha helices, which are typical of EF-hand proteins, contributing to its calcium-binding capabilities (Otterbein2002Crystal).

In terms of tertiary structure, S100A6 folds into a compact conformation that allows for effective calcium binding. This folding involves four helices and three loops, which are organized into two calcium-binding motifs known as the S100-hand (Otterbein2002Crystal). Upon calcium binding, S100A6 undergoes significant conformational changes, including the reorientation of helices and exposure of hydrophobic patches, which affect its electrostatic surface and hydrophobicity (Otterbein2002Crystal).

The quaternary structure of S100A6 involves the formation of homodimers, stabilized by hydrophobic interactions between specific helices (Otterbein2002Crystal). These dimers are crucial for the protein's function as a calcium sensor and its interaction with target proteins (Lee2008Structure). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence S100A6's function and interactions, although specific details are not provided in the context.

## Function
S100A6, also known as calcyclin, is a calcium-binding protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes. It is primarily found in epithelial cells and fibroblasts, and is localized in the cytoplasm, nucleus, and associates with the plasma membrane and nuclear envelope when intracellular calcium levels rise (Leśniak2023S100A6). The protein is involved in calcium signaling pathways, influencing cell proliferation, differentiation, and cytoskeletal dynamics (Leśniak2023S100A6).

S100A6 interacts with a wide range of ligands, including cytoplasmic, membrane, nuclear, and extracellular proteins, in a calcium-dependent manner. These interactions suggest its involvement in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics by binding to proteins like tropomyosin, caldesmon, and actin, which are crucial for cytoskeletal organization (Leśniak2023S100A6). In the nucleus, S100A6 interacts with lamin proteins and importin α, indicating roles in nuclear structure and transport (Leśniak2023S100A6).

The protein also participates in stress responses by interacting with heat shock proteins and co-chaperones, potentially affecting protein refolding and disaggregation (Leśniak2023S100A6). S100A6 is secreted extracellularly and found in various physiological fluids, where it may regulate secretory processes and cell adhesion (Leśniak2023S100A6). These diverse functions highlight S100A6's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental changes.

## Clinical Significance
The S100A6 gene, part of the S100 protein family, has significant clinical implications due to its altered expression in various diseases. In glioma, a highly aggressive brain tumor, S100A6 expression is notably increased compared to normal tissues. This elevated expression correlates with WHO grading, pathological stage, and molecular markers such as IDH status and 1p/19q codeletion. High S100A6 levels are associated with poorer prognosis and shorter survival times in glioma patients, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker (Hong2023S100A6).

S100A6 is also implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). In AD, S100A6 is upregulated in reactive astrocytes surrounding β-amyloid deposits, potentially playing a role in disease pathogenesis by interacting with Zn2+ and influencing tau protein phosphorylation (Filipek2020S100A6).

Additionally, S100A6 interacts with the p53 protein, affecting its nuclear translocation and activity under stress conditions. This interaction may enhance p53's apoptotic function, impacting cancer cell behavior where p53 is not mutated but mislocalized (Słomnicki2009S100A6). These findings highlight the gene's involvement in cancer progression and neurodegenerative diseases.

## Interactions
S100A6, also known as calcyclin, is a calcium-binding protein that interacts with a variety of proteins across different cellular compartments. These interactions are primarily calcium-dependent, highlighting S100A6's role in calcium signaling pathways. S100A6 interacts with cytoskeletal proteins such as tropomyosin, caldesmon, calponin, non-muscle myosin IIA, actin, and cofilin-1, as well as microtubule components like α and β tubulin, kinesin light chain, and centrosomal proteins, indicating its involvement in cytoskeletal dynamics (Leśniak2023S100A6).

In the nucleus, S100A6 binds to proteins such as lamin B1, lamin A/C, importin α, and ribosomal S6 kinase 1, suggesting a role in nuclear structure and transport (Leśniak2023S100A6). It also interacts with transcription factors of the p53 family and the ubiquitin ligase Mdm2, affecting p53 activity and enhancing its transcriptional activity under stress conditions (Słomnicki2009S100A6).

S100A6 binds to annexins involved in membrane processes and proteins associated with the Hsp70/Hsp90 machinery, indicating a role in stress response (Leśniak2023S100A6). It also interacts with the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), which is involved in pro-inflammatory responses (Sakane2017Identification). These diverse interactions underscore S100A6's multifunctional role in cellular processes.
