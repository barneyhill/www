# OR2T2

## Overview
The OR2T2 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily T member 2, which is part of the large family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) involved in the detection of odorants. These receptors are characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is typical of many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors. The protein plays a crucial role in the olfactory system by binding specific odorant molecules, initiating a neuronal response that results in the perception of smell. The OR2T2 gene is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it contributes to the diversity and specificity of olfactory signaling. Its involvement in various physiological and pathological processes, such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia, underscores its potential significance beyond olfaction (Dibattista2020Alzheimer’s; Castellani2017Post‐zygotic).

## Clinical Significance
The OR2T2 gene, part of the olfactory receptor family, has been implicated in several conditions through alterations in its expression or genetic mutations. In the context of Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, OR2T2 is identified among the copy-number alterations (CNAs) previously detected in MRKH type 1, suggesting a potential role in this congenital condition affecting female reproductive development (Pan2019Detection). Additionally, OR2T2 is mentioned as potentially compatible with the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, with missense changes in this gene observed in affected individuals, although further validation is needed to establish its precise role (Castellani2017Post‐zygotic).

In Alzheimer's disease, OR2T2 is differentially regulated, with downregulation observed at intermediate stages in the olfactory bulb, indicating a possible involvement in the disease's progression and olfactory dysfunction (Dibattista2020Alzheimer’s). Furthermore, a study on colorectal cancer found a negative correlation between OR2T2 expression and telomere length, though the specific implications of this finding require further investigation (LopezDoriga2018Telomere). These associations highlight the potential clinical significance of OR2T2 in various conditions, although more research is needed to fully understand its roles.
