# EIF4E2

## Overview
EIF4E2 is a gene that encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E family member 2 (4EHP), a protein involved in the regulation of mRNA translation. As a member of the eIF4E family, 4EHP plays a distinct role in translational repression rather than initiation, differentiating it from its canonical counterpart, eIF4E1. The protein is characterized by its ability to bind the 5' cap structure of mRNA, albeit with lower affinity compared to eIF4E1, which limits its role in ribosome recruitment (Christie2021eIF4E‐homologous; Kubacka2013Investigating). Instead, 4EHP forms complexes with other proteins, such as 4E-T and GIGYF2, to mediate processes like miRNA-mediated gene silencing and nonsense-mediated decay (Zinshteyn2021Translational; Christie2021eIF4E‐homologous). Additionally, 4EHP is involved in the cellular response to hypoxia, participating in a specialized eIF4F complex that regulates the translation of hypoxia-inducible mRNAs (Christie2021eIF4E‐homologous). The gene's involvement in various cellular processes, including stress response and development, underscores its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Zinshteyn2021Translational; Christie2021eIF4E‐homologous).

## Structure
The EIF4E2 protein, also known as 4EHP, is a member of the eIF4E family involved in cap-dependent translation initiation and repression. It is approximately 245 amino acids long and shares about 30% identity and 60% similarity with eIF4E1 (Kubacka2013Investigating). The protein features a conserved globular domain resembling a cupped hand, crucial for its function in cap recognition (Christie2021eIF4E‐homologous). The cap-binding site involves aromatic stacking interactions, utilizing conserved tryptophan and tyrosine residues, specifically Tyr78 and Trp124 in humans (Christie2021eIF4E‐homologous).

EIF4E2's cap-binding affinity is significantly lower than that of eIF4E1, due to differences in the loop structure that affects ligand binding (Kubacka2013Investigating). Post-translational modifications, such as ISGylation at Lys134 and Lys222, enhance its affinity for the cap structure and are mediated by the E3 ligase HHARI (Christie2021eIF4E‐homologous). The protein does not interact with eIF4G and binds weakly to 4E-BPs, indicating a distinct regulatory role compared to eIF4E1 (Kubacka2013Investigating).

EIF4E2 exists in multiple isoforms, such as eIF4E2_A, eIF4E2_C, and eIF4E2_CRA_a, which differ in their C-terminal regions and localization patterns within cells (Frydryskova2016Distinct). These isoforms are recruited to processing bodies but not stress granules during oxidative stress (Frydryskova2016Distinct).

## Function
The EIF4E2 gene encodes the eIF4E-homologous protein (4EHP), which is involved in the regulation of mRNA translation in human cells. Unlike the canonical eIF4E1, which facilitates ribosome recruitment to mRNAs, 4EHP primarily acts as a translational repressor. It binds to the 5' cap structure of mRNA with a weaker affinity than eIF4E1, which limits its ability to compete for cap binding (Christie2021eIF4E‐homologous; Kubacka2013Investigating). 

4EHP forms complexes with various proteins, such as 4E-T and GIGYF2, to mediate translational repression. These complexes are involved in miRNA-mediated gene silencing and nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), regulating the translation of specific mRNAs rather than global protein synthesis (Zinshteyn2021Translational; Christie2021eIF4E‐homologous). 

In response to hypoxic conditions, 4EHP participates in a hypoxia-specific eIF4F complex that directs the translation of mRNAs containing hypoxia response elements, thereby influencing the synthesis of hypoxia-inducible proteins (Christie2021eIF4E‐homologous). Additionally, 4EHP is involved in maintaining basal phosphorylation of p53, which is crucial for its stability and cellular localization, particularly under stress conditions like hypoxia (Sun2022Mammalian).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the EIF4E2 gene, which encodes the eIF4E-homologous protein (4EHP), have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), mutations in the GIGYF2 gene, which interacts with EIF4E2, have been associated with ASD, although direct causality has not been established. Disruption of the 4EHP-GIGYF2 complex is hypothesized to contribute to ASD by affecting synaptic plasticity and social behaviors (Wiebe2020The).

EIF4E2 also plays a role in translational repression during hypoxic conditions, which is relevant to cancer progression. Its ability to mediate hypoxia-specific protein synthesis suggests potential therapeutic targets for tumors that thrive in low oxygen environments (Christie2021eIF4E‐homologous). Additionally, EIF4E2, in conjunction with GIGYF2, is involved in the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway, which prevents the synthesis of potentially harmful proteins from mRNAs with premature termination codons. This function is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing neurodegenerative diseases (Zinshteyn2021Translational; Christie2021eIF4E‐homologous). Dysregulation of these processes can lead to various pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases and schizophrenia (Christie2021eIF4E‐homologous).

## Interactions
EIF4E2, also known as 4EHP, is involved in various protein interactions that regulate mRNA translation. It forms a complex with 4E-T, which is part of the miRNA-mediated gene silencing machinery. This complex competes with eIF4E1 for cap binding, thereby blocking translation initiation of miRNA targets (Christie2021eIF4E‐homologous; Chen2017MicroRNAs). EIF4E2 also interacts with TNRC6A, a core component of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), to inhibit the translation of target mRNAs. This interaction is crucial for miRNA-mediated repression (Chen2017MicroRNAs).

EIF4E2 forms complexes with GIGYF1/2 proteins, which are involved in translational repression and mRNA decay. These complexes interact with proteins such as Tristetraprolin and ZNF598 to regulate inflammatory signaling and mouse embryonic development (Christie2021eIF4E‐homologous). EIF4E2 also interacts with vertebrate threonyl-tRNA synthetase (ThrRS) to direct the translation of mRNAs necessary for vascular, nervous, and skeletal system development (Christie2021eIF4E‐homologous).

In hypoxic conditions, EIF4E2 is part of a hypoxia-specific eIF4F complex with eIF4G3 and eIF4A, directing translation of mRNAs with hypoxia response elements (Christie2021eIF4E‐homologous). These interactions highlight EIF4E2's role in various cellular processes, including stress response and development.
