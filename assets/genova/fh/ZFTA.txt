# ZFTA

## Overview
The ZFTA gene encodes the zinc finger translocation associated protein, which plays a pivotal role in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling. This protein is characterized by the presence of zinc finger domains, specifically the C2H2-type, which facilitate DNA binding and are crucial for its function as a transcriptional regulator (Arabzade2024ZFTA). ZFTA is notably involved in the formation of oncogenic fusion proteins, such as ZFTA-RELA, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of ependymomas, a type of brain tumor (Zheng2021EPEN03.). These fusion proteins enhance transcriptional activity by recruiting chromatin remodeling complexes and transcriptional coactivators, leading to aberrant gene expression (Kupp2021ZFTATranslocations). The study of ZFTA and its associated fusion proteins is critical for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis and for identifying potential therapeutic targets (Arabzade2021ZFTA–RELA).

## Structure
The ZFTA protein, associated with transcriptional regulation, contains zinc finger domains crucial for DNA binding. Specifically, the ZFTA protein includes a C2H2 zinc finger domain, known as ZF1, which is essential for its DNA binding capability. This domain has been structurally analyzed using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), confirming its folding consistent with Alpha Fold 2 modeling (Arabzade2024ZFTA). The ZF1 domain is encoded by residues 81-172 of the wild-type ZFTA protein, and its DNA binding sequence has been identified as 5'-GGCCCC-3' (Arabzade2024ZFTA).

The ZFTA protein also features intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), with IDR3 playing a significant role in forming transcriptional condensates. This region is enriched in proline, alanine, and glutamine, facilitating multivalent interactions necessary for condensate formation (Arabzade2024ZFTA). Mutations in IDR3 can disrupt DNA binding and transcriptional activity, highlighting its importance in chromatin binding and oncogenic transformation (Arabzade2024ZFTA).

While the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of the ZFTA protein are not detailed in the available context, the presence of zinc finger domains and IDRs suggests a complex structure that supports its role in transcriptional regulation and oncogenesis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ZFTA gene are significantly associated with the development of ependymomas, a type of brain tumor. ZFTA is frequently involved in oncogenic fusion proteins, particularly with RELA, which is a component of the NF-ĸB family of transcription factors. These fusions are prevalent in supratentorial ependymomas, accounting for over 60% of cases, and are sufficient to drive tumor formation (Zheng2021EPEN03.; Arabzade2021ZFTA–RELA). The ZFTA-RELA fusion protein contributes to tumorigenesis by recruiting chromatin remodeling complexes and transcriptional coactivators, leading to aberrant gene expression and chromatin remodeling (Kupp2021ZFTATranslocations; Arabzade2021ZFTA–RELA).

ZFTA fusions with other partners, such as YAP1, MAML2, and NCOA2, also play a role in ependymoma development, highlighting the gene's broad involvement in tumorigenesis (Arabzade2024ZFTA; Kupp2021ZFTATranslocations). These fusions often result in the formation of transcriptional condensates, which are crucial for oncogene activation and tumor initiation (Arabzade2024ZFTA). The presence of ZFTA fusions is particularly associated with pediatric brain tumors, suggesting a specific susceptibility in neural stem cells to these genetic alterations (Zheng2021EPEN03.). Understanding the molecular mechanisms of ZFTA fusions offers potential therapeutic targets, such as the inhibition of transcriptional coactivators like BRD4 and EP300 (Arabzade2021ZFTA–RELA).

## Interactions
The ZFTA protein, also known as C11orf95, is involved in various interactions that play a crucial role in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling, particularly in the context of ependymoma. ZFTA forms fusion proteins with several partners, including RELA, YAP1, MAML2, and MRTFB, which act as transcriptional co-regulators. These fusion proteins facilitate nuclear translocation and chromatin binding, recruiting chromatin remodeling complexes such as SWI/SNF, SAGA, and NuA4/Tip60, which convert genes to a transcriptionally active state (Kupp2021ZFTATranslocations).

The ZFTA-RELA fusion protein, in particular, acts as a chromatin-bound transcription factor, with extensive genome-wide binding sites distinct from RELA alone. This fusion protein is associated with increased gene expression and chromatin remodeling, marked by active histone modifications like H3K27ac, promoting the transcription of genes involved in ependymoma tumorigenesis (Kupp2021ZFTATranslocations). ZFTA-RELA also interacts with nuclear proteins involved in chromatin binding and transcription, uniquely binding components of the SWI/SNF complex and the histone acetylator CREBBP (Kupp2021ZFTATranslocations).

ZFTA fusion proteins, through their zinc finger domains, are crucial for chromatin binding and recruitment of transcriptional coactivators, including the Mediator complex, which are indispensable for fusion-driven tumorigenesis (Kupp2021ZFTATranslocations).
