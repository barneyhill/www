# FAM90A26

## Overview
FAM90A26 is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 90, specifically member A26. This gene is part of a larger family of genes that are characterized by their conserved sequences, which suggest a shared evolutionary origin and potential functional similarities. The protein encoded by FAM90A26 is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific role and mechanisms of action remain to be fully elucidated. Research into the FAM90A26 gene and its protein product is ongoing, with studies aiming to uncover its potential implications in health and disease. Understanding the function and interactions of the FAM90A26 protein could provide insights into its contribution to cellular physiology and its relevance in clinical contexts (Qiu2020aarFDC).
