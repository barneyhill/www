# UBXN1

## Overview
UBXN1 is a gene that encodes the UBX domain protein 1, a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, including protein quality control, cellular homeostasis, and mitochondrial function. The protein is characterized by the presence of a UBX domain, which facilitates interactions with other proteins, and a UBA domain, which specifically recognizes K6-linked polyubiquitin chains. UBX domain protein 1 acts as a negative regulator of the NF-κB signaling pathway, playing a crucial role in controlling inflammation and immune responses. It is also involved in maintaining endoplasmic reticulum proteostasis and mitochondrial integrity, highlighting its importance in cellular stress responses. Alterations in UBXN1 expression have been implicated in several diseases, particularly cancer, where it influences tumor progression and patient outcomes (Mengus2021VCPp97; Wang2015Ubiquitinassociated; WuBaer2010The; Ahlstedt2022UBXN1).

## Structure
UBXN1 is a protein characterized by the presence of a UBX domain and a UBA domain. The UBX domain is located at the C-terminal end and adopts a three-dimensional fold similar to ubiquitin, which is crucial for its interactions with other proteins (WuBaer2010The). The UBA domain, located at the N-terminal, consists of three tightly packed α helices and is essential for recognizing K6-linked polyubiquitin chains (WuBaer2010The; Shahul2020DiubiquitinBased). This domain is extended in some contexts, enhancing its specificity for K6-linked diubiquitin (Shahul2020DiubiquitinBased).

UBXN1 interacts with the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer through its C-terminal sequences independently of ubiquitin, while the UBA domain binds to K6-linked polyubiquitin chains on BRCA1 (WuBaer2010The). The protein also contains a coiled-coil domain between the UBA and UBX domains, which may contribute to its structural stability and interaction capabilities (Wang2015Ubiquitinassociated).

UBXN1 is involved in modulating the enzymatic function of BRCA1/BARD1 and acts as a negative regulator of NF-κB signaling by interacting with components of the TNF receptor complex (Wang2015Ubiquitinassociated). The protein's structure and interactions are critical for its regulatory roles in cellular processes.

## Function
UBXN1 (UBX domain protein 1) plays a crucial role in maintaining protein quality control and cellular homeostasis in healthy human cells. It functions as a negative regulator of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is important for controlling inflammation and immune responses. UBXN1 inhibits TNFα-triggered NF-κB activation by sequestering cellular inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (cIAPs) from the TNF receptor 1 complex, thereby preventing the polyubiquitination of receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) (Wang2015Ubiquitinassociated).

UBXN1 is also involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteostasis by repressing the unfolded protein response (UPR) and modulating protein translation independently of the p97 ATPase. Its loss leads to increased ER stress and activation of UPR pathways, which can result in cell death (Ahlstedt2022UBXN1). UBXN1 helps maintain ER protein homeostasis by regulating the abundance and solubility of ER proteins, preventing their aggregation under stress conditions (Ahlstedt2022UBXN1).

In addition, UBXN1 is involved in mitochondrial morphology and function. It translocates to depolarized mitochondria and is essential for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and bioenergetic function, as its loss leads to mitochondrial fragmentation and impaired ATP production (Mengus2021VCPp97).

## Clinical Significance
UBXN1 has been implicated in several diseases, particularly various forms of cancer, due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), UBXN1 is aberrantly upregulated, with higher expression levels in tumor tissues compared to non-tumor tissues. This upregulation is associated with poor patient outcomes, as patients with high UBXN1 levels have shorter overall survival. The gene's role in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis is crucial for tumor cell survival and growth, and its interaction with prohibitin (PHB) promotes mitochondrial integrity, contributing to HCC development and progression (Jiao2024UBXN1).

In prostate cancer, UBXN1 is involved in cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Knockdown of UBXN1 in prostate cancer cell lines inhibits these processes, suggesting its significant role in tumor aggressiveness. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the UBXN1 gene are associated with the Gleason score, a predictor of tumor aggressiveness, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Oh2021ARRDC4).

In gliomas, UBXN1 mRNA decay is facilitated by YTHDF2 through m6A modification, affecting the NF-κB signaling pathway. This interaction promotes tumor growth and poor survival outcomes, highlighting UBXN1's role in modulating the malignant phenotype of tumors (Chai2021YTHDF2).

## Interactions
UBXN1 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It associates with the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer, binding independently of ubiquitin. This interaction involves the C-terminal portion of UBXN1, excluding its UBA domain, which binds near the RING domain and BARD1-interacting sequences of BRCA1 (WuBaer2010The). UBXN1 also binds to K6-linked polyubiquitin chains synthesized by BRCA1/BARD1, with its UBA domain specifically recognizing these chains (WuBaer2010The).

UBXN1 forms a complex with VCP (also known as p97), which is involved in the degradation of ubiquitylated proteins associated with the BAG6 complex. This interaction is crucial for the triage of ubiquitylated cytosolic proteins, with UBXN1 recognizing ubiquitylated substrates in a BAG6-dependent manner (Ganji2018The). UBXN1 also interacts with the UFD1-NPL4 dimer, associating with the p97 hexamer to facilitate aggresome formation, a process critical for managing protein aggregates in cells (Mukkavalli2020The).

In mitophagy, UBXN1 interacts with PRKN (Parkin), translocating to mitochondria in a PRKN-dependent manner under mitophagic conditions. This interaction suggests a role for UBXN1 in modulating mitochondrial quality control (Mengus2021VCPp97).
