# ACOT2

## Overview
The ACOT2 gene encodes the mitochondrial enzyme acyl-CoA thioesterase 2, which is a member of the thioesterase family characterized by an α/β hydrolase fold. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in lipid metabolism by hydrolyzing long-chain acyl-CoA thioesters into free fatty acids and CoA, thereby regulating fatty acid oxidation within the mitochondria (Brocker2010Evolutionary; Hunt2006Analysis). The protein is predominantly expressed in energy-demanding tissues such as the heart, liver, and skeletal muscle, where it contributes to cellular energy homeostasis and metabolic flexibility (Hunt2006Analysis). ACOT2's activity is modulated by dietary factors, such as a high-fat diet, which upregulates its expression to prevent insulin resistance and maintain efficient β-oxidation (Swarbrick2020Structure). The enzyme's structural and functional attributes underscore its importance in maintaining lipid and energy balance in human cells.

## Structure
The human ACOT2 protein, also known as MTE-I and PTE2, is a member of the TE2 family of thioesterases. It is characterized by an α/β hydrolase fold, which is a common structural motif in this enzyme family (Cantu2010Thioesterases:; Swarbrick2020Structure). The secondary structure of ACOT2 is organized in the sequence β1-β2-β3-α1-β4-α2-β5-α3-β6-β7-α4-β8-α5, and its quaternary structure is monomeric, distinguishing it from other hydrolases with a hotdog fold (Swarbrick2020Structure).

The crystal structure of ACOT2 reveals an N-terminal domain with a seven-stranded β-sandwich and a C-terminal domain with an α/β-hydrolase fold. The active site, located at the interface between these domains, includes a catalytic triad composed of Ser 294, His 422, and Asp 388, which is typical of α/β hydrolases (Hunt2012The; Swarbrick2020Structure).

ACOT2 is expressed in the mitochondria of the heart and is regulated by PPARα in response to non-esterified fatty acid availability. The protein's expression is upregulated in response to a high-fat diet, which is thought to help prevent insulin resistance and maintain β-oxidation (Swarbrick2020Structure). The structure of ACOT2 is available in the Protein Data Bank under the accession code 3HLK (Swarbrick2020Structure).

## Function
The ACOT2 gene encodes a mitochondrial acyl-CoA thioesterase enzyme that plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism by hydrolyzing long-chain acyl-CoA thioesters into free fatty acids and CoA. This activity is essential for regulating fatty acid oxidation within the mitochondria, contributing to cellular energy homeostasis and metabolic flexibility (Brocker2010Evolutionary; Hunt2006Analysis). ACOT2 is primarily active on long-chain saturated and unsaturated acyl-CoAs, such as those with 12 to 20 carbon atoms, indicating its involvement in the metabolism of long-chain fatty acids (Hunt2006Analysis).

The enzyme is localized to the mitochondria due to a mitochondrial targeting signal at its N-terminal end, which directs its transport to this organelle (Hunt2006Analysis). Within the mitochondria, ACOT2 facilitates fatty acid oxidation by preventing the accumulation of inhibitory long-chain fatty acyl-CoA esters, thus enhancing the efficiency of β-oxidation (Moffat2014AcylCoA). This process is particularly important in tissues with high energy demands, such as the heart, liver, and skeletal muscle, where ACOT2 is highly expressed (Hunt2006Analysis). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining energy production and lipid metabolism in healthy human cells.
