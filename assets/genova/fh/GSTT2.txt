# GSTT2

## Overview
The GSTT2 gene encodes the enzyme glutathione S-transferase theta 2, a member of the theta class of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), which are crucial for cellular detoxification processes. This enzyme plays a significant role in the conjugation of glutathione to various electrophilic compounds, facilitating their conversion into less reactive and more water-soluble forms. This activity is essential for protecting cells from oxidative stress and genotoxic damage. The GSTT2 protein is characterized by its substrate specificity towards organic hydroperoxides and unsaturated aldehydes, contributing to its function in reducing oxidative damage within cells (Miene2011Impact; TAN1996Purification). The gene's expression and activity are particularly relevant in tissues exposed to high oxidative stress, such as the colon and esophagus, and are influenced by dietary components like polyphenols (FerrerTorres2019Constitutively; Petermann2009GSTT2). Variations in the GSTT2 gene have been associated with increased risks of diseases such as schizophrenia and colorectal cancer, highlighting its clinical significance in detoxification pathways (Jang2007GSTT2; RodríguezSantiago2009Association).

## Structure
The GSTT2 protein is a member of the theta-class glutathione S-transferases, which are involved in detoxification processes. The primary structure of GSTT2 consists of an amino acid sequence that forms a protein with a molecular mass of approximately 27 kDa, consistent with a calculated mass of 27,489 Da (TAN1996Purification). The secondary structure includes alpha-helices, as indicated by the crystal structure of GSTT2-2, where the C-terminal residues form part of a helix that packs across the active site (COGGAN1998Structure). This structural feature is crucial for the enzyme's activity, as deletion of these residues results in inactivation.

The tertiary structure of GSTT2 involves the three-dimensional folding necessary for its enzymatic function, although specific details on the tertiary structure are not provided in the context. The quaternary structure is not explicitly described, but GSTT2-2 is characterized as a recombinant enzyme, suggesting it may function as a dimer or multimer, similar to other GSTs (TAN1996Purification).

GSTT2 exhibits substrate specificity towards organic hydroperoxides and unsaturated aldehydes, but not hydrogen peroxide, indicating a role in protecting cells against oxidative stress (TAN1996Purification). The enzyme's activity is influenced by its structural integrity, particularly the conserved domain for glutathione binding.

## Function
GSTT2, or glutathione S-transferase theta 2, is an enzyme involved in the detoxification processes within human cells. It belongs to the theta class of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), which are phase II detoxification enzymes. GSTT2 facilitates the conjugation of glutathione to a variety of electrophilic compounds, aiding in their conversion to more hydrophilic and less reactive forms, thus protecting cells from oxidative stress and genotoxic damage (Miene2011Impact; TAN1996Purification).

GSTT2 exhibits glutathione peroxidase activity, particularly towards polyunsaturated fatty acid hydroperoxides and cumene hydroperoxide, suggesting a role in protecting cells against lipid peroxidation and oxygen toxicity (TAN1996Purification). This enzyme is active in the cytoplasm and is involved in reducing hydroperoxides to their corresponding alcohols, thereby mitigating oxidative damage (Miene2011Impact).

In colon epithelial cells, GSTT2 expression is upregulated by polyphenols, such as those derived from apples, which enhances its protective role against DNA damage induced by oxidative agents like cumene hydroperoxide (Petermann2009GSTT2). The enzyme's activity is crucial in maintaining cellular integrity, particularly in tissues exposed to high oxidative stress, such as the colon and esophagus (FerrerTorres2019Constitutively).

## Clinical Significance
The GSTT2 gene has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in detoxification processes. Variations in GSTT2, such as common copy number variants (CNVs), have been associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia. Individuals with non-null genotypes of GSTT2, along with GSTM1, show a higher susceptibility to schizophrenia, potentially due to disruptions in glutathione metabolism, which is crucial for defense against oxidative stress (RodríguezSantiago2009Association). 

In the context of cancer, GSTT2 promoter polymorphisms have been linked to colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the GSTT2 promoter, such as the -537G>A allele, are associated with an increased risk of CRC, while the -158G>A allele appears to have a protective effect. These polymorphisms may influence CRC risk by affecting gene expression and protein binding (Jang2007GSTT2). 

These findings suggest that genetic variations in GSTT2 can impact its detoxification function, contributing to the development of conditions like schizophrenia and colorectal cancer, where detoxification pathways are disrupted.
