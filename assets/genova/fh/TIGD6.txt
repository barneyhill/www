# TIGD6

## Overview
TIGD6, or tigger transposable element derived 6, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various genomic interactions and cellular processes. The protein encoded by TIGD6 is derived from the Tigger transposable element, suggesting an evolutionary origin linked to transposable elements (Dupeyron2020Phylogenetic). TIGD6 is expressed in multiple human tissues, including the prostate gland, spinal cord, and endocrine system, indicating its potential involvement in diverse biological functions (Dupeyron2020Phylogenetic). The gene is implicated in RNA polymerase II-mediated DNA interactions, particularly through G-quadruplex structures, which are crucial for transcriptional regulation (Yuan2023Gquadruplex). Additionally, TIGD6 has been associated with cancer progression, particularly in oral squamous cell carcinoma and colorectal cancers, where it may influence genomic stability and patient survival outcomes (Rao2022Genomic; Kim2012Biomarker). Despite its emerging significance, the precise biological roles and clinical implications of TIGD6 remain areas of active research.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
TIGD6 (tigger transposable element derived 6) has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in genomic instability. In colorectal cancers (CRCs), TIGD6 is identified as one of the genes associated with copy number alterations (CNA) and patient survival. Decreased expression of TIGD6 is linked to improved survival outcomes, suggesting its potential as a target for inhibitor development in cancer therapy (Rao2022Genomic). The study by Rao et al. also highlights TIGD6 as a CNA facilitator-survival critical gene, indicating its involvement in genomic instability and potential impact on therapy outcomes (Rao2022Genomic).

In the context of familial obesity, a frameshift deletion variant in TIGD6 was identified, although the clinical significance of this mutation remains unclear (Kaewsutthi2016Exome). In osteosarcoma, TIGD6 was found to have homozygous somatic small indels causing frameshifts, but no altered mRNA expression was observed, and its role in this cancer type is not well established (Reimann2014Whole).

Overall, while TIGD6 is associated with genomic instability in certain cancers, its precise mechanisms and broader clinical implications require further investigation.

## Interactions
TIGD6, a gene derived from the Tigger transposable element, is involved in various interactions within the human genome. It is known to participate in 21 protein-protein interactions, indicating its embedded role in the host genome and suggesting a functional significance in cellular processes (Dupeyron2020Phylogenetic). The gene is widely expressed across numerous organs, with notable expression in the prostate gland, spinal cord, and endocrine system, which may imply diverse functional roles (Dupeyron2020Phylogenetic).

TIGD6 is also implicated in RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)-mediated DNA interactions. G-quadruplex (G4) DNA structures at the promoter regions of TIGD6 are involved in RNAPII recruitment and long-range DNA interactions. Treatment with PDS, a G4 ligand, has been shown to displace RNAPII from the promoters of genes like TIGD6, indicating that G4 structures are crucial for these interactions (Yuan2023Gquadruplex).

In the context of cancer, TIGD6 has been identified as a common gene in gene sets associated with lymph node metastasis in oral squamous cell carcinoma, suggesting a potential role in cancer progression (Kim2012Biomarker). These interactions highlight the multifaceted roles of TIGD6 in human biology.
