# COPG1

## Overview
COPG1 is a gene that encodes the gamma 1 subunit of the coatomer protein complex I (COPI), a cytosolic protein complex essential for intracellular transport. The COPI complex is involved in retrograde transport, specifically mediating the movement of proteins and lipids from the Golgi apparatus back to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This transport is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and function of the Golgi complex, as well as for the proper sorting and trafficking of cellular components. The protein encoded by COPG1, known as the COPI coat complex subunit gamma 1, is a part of the heptameric structure of the COPI complex, which is recruited to Golgi membranes by the small GTPase Arf1 to facilitate vesicle formation and cargo recognition (Jackson2014Structure; Arakel2018Formation; Dodonova2015A).

## Function
The COPG1 gene encodes a subunit of the coatomer protein complex I (COPI), which plays a crucial role in intracellular transport processes, particularly in retrograde transport from the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). COPI is essential for maintaining the structure and function of the Golgi complex, as well as for sorting proteins and lipids within the cell (Jackson2014Structure; Arakel2018Formation).

The COPI complex is a heptameric structure composed of several subunits, including the γ-COP subunit encoded by COPG1. This complex is involved in the formation of vesicles that mediate the transport of materials between cellular compartments. The recruitment of COPI to Golgi membranes is facilitated by the small GTPase Arf1, which, when activated, interacts with the COPI complex to initiate vesicle formation (Jackson2014Structure; Dodonova2015A).

COPI also plays a role in the recognition and binding of cargo proteins, particularly those with dilysine motifs, which are important for retrograde trafficking. These interactions are mediated by specific domains within the COPI subunits, ensuring the proper sorting and transport of proteins within the cell (Jackson2014Structure). The proper functioning of COPI is vital for cellular homeostasis and the maintenance of the early secretory pathway (Arakel2018Formation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the COPG1 gene, specifically the homozygous K652E mutation, are associated with combined immunodeficiency (CID). This mutation disrupts the binding of the KDEL receptor by the coatomer, impairing retrograde COPI-mediated transport from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This disruption leads to increased ER stress and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), which impairs immune function by depleting ER chaperones and interfering with immunoglobulin G (IgG) secretion. Patients with this mutation exhibit chronic bacterial and viral infections, severe CD4+ T cell lymphopenia, and reduced T cell proliferation, resulting in poor antibody responses to vaccines and diminished IgG secretion (Bainter2021Combined).

The increased ER stress in activated T and B cells due to the COPG1 mutation can be partially alleviated by treatment with tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), which corrects some immune defects in mutant mice (Bainter2021Combined; Steiner2022Deficiency). Additionally, alterations in COPG1 expression have been implicated in multiple sclerosis (MS), where it is identified as a potential biomarker. Changes in COPG1 expression are associated with immune-related pathways and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its clinical significance beyond immunodeficiency (Delkhah2024Integrated).

## Interactions
COPG1, a subunit of the coatomer complex I (COPI), plays a crucial role in retrograde trafficking between the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It interacts with other COPI subunits, such as COPA, COPD, and COPE, to facilitate this transport process (Steiner2022Deficiency). COPG1 is particularly involved in the retrieval of proteins from the Golgi to the ER, distinguishing its function from its paralogue COPG2 (Steiner2022Deficiency).

COPG1 is implicated in immune signaling pathways, particularly through its interaction with the STING signaling pathway. Deletion of COPG1 leads to spontaneous activation of the STING pathway, suggesting that COPG1 interacts with components of this pathway to regulate immune responses (Steiner2022Deficiency). This interaction is crucial for maintaining proper localization and function of STING, an immune signaling protein (Steiner2022Deficiency).

The deficiency of COPG1 results in impaired retrograde trafficking, leading to increased ER stress and activation of inflammatory pathways, such as the cGAS/STING pathway (Steiner2022Deficiency). This suggests that COPG1's interactions are essential for preventing aberrant activation of these pathways and maintaining cellular homeostasis.
