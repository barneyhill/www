# CHORDC1

## Overview
CHORDC1, or cysteine and histidine rich domain containing 1, is a gene that encodes a protein known as Morgana, which functions primarily as a co-chaperone. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the folding and stabilization of client proteins through its interaction with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90). Morgana plays a significant role in the trafficking and maturation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), influencing critical signaling pathways such as RAS/MAPK, which are essential for cell growth and differentiation (Haag2020The). Additionally, CHORDC1 is implicated in the regulation of microtubule dynamics and may have HSP90-independent functions, particularly in receptor trafficking and cellular stress responses (Haag2020The). The protein's interactions extend to viral proteins, suggesting a broader role in modulating host-pathogen interactions (Zhang2014Screening). Alterations in CHORDC1 expression have been linked to various diseases, including cancer and chronic myeloid leukemia, highlighting its clinical significance (Ferretti2010Morganachp1; Poggio2024miR15a).

## Function
CHORDC1, also known as Morgana, is a protein that functions as a co-chaperone, primarily interacting with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) to assist in the folding and stabilization of client proteins. In human cells, CHORDC1 plays a crucial role in the trafficking and maturation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). It is involved in the proper folding and trafficking of EGFR through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), ensuring its correct localization to the cell membrane. The absence of CHORDC1 leads to the accumulation of EGFR in the ER and a reduction in the activation of the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway, which is essential for various cellular processes, including cell growth and differentiation (Haag2020The).

CHORDC1 is active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing cell signaling and stress resilience. It may act independently of HSP90, as its deficiency results in more pronounced effects on EGFR levels when HSP90 is inhibited, suggesting a specific role in promoting EGFR maturation and trafficking (Haag2020The). CHORDC1 is also implicated in the regulation of microtubule dynamics and may contribute to cellular processes related to receptor trafficking (Haag2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the CHORDC1 gene, which encodes the Morgana protein, have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer. In the context of tumorigenesis, reduced expression of Morgana is associated with increased susceptibility to oncogenic transformation and tumor development. Morgana acts as a ROCK inhibitor, and its downregulation leads to centrosome amplification, genomic instability, and increased tumor susceptibility, particularly in breast and lung cancers (Ferretti2010Morganachp1).

In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), Morgana expression is downregulated in some patients, especially those resistant to imatinib treatment. This downregulation is not due to CHORDC1 gene deletion but is linked to the activity of microRNAs such as miR-15a and miR-26a/b, which target Morgana mRNA, reducing its expression. This regulation by miRNAs may contribute to the pathogenesis of CML by promoting myeloid cell proliferation and genomic instability (Poggio2024miR15a).

CHORDC1 also plays a role in hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication. MicroRNA-26b targets CHORDC1, downregulating its expression and thereby inhibiting HBV transcription and replication. This interaction suggests a potential therapeutic target for HBV-related diseases (Zhao2014MicroRNA26b).

## Interactions
CHORDC1, also known as cysteine and histidine rich domain containing 1, is a protein that interacts with several molecular partners, primarily through its association with heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). CHORDC1 directly binds to Hsp90 in an ATP-independent manner, distinguishing it from other Hsp90 co-chaperones like p23, which typically require ATP for binding (Wu2004Mammalian). The interaction is specific, as Hsp90 does not bind to truncated forms of CHORDC1 or control proteins (Wu2004Mammalian).

CHORDC1 is also involved in the regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) trafficking. In human cells, CHORDC1 deficiency leads to EGFR accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum and reduced MAPK pathway activation, suggesting a role in EGFR maturation and membrane secretion (Haag2020The). Although CHORDC1 is proposed to act as a co-chaperone with Hsp90, it may also have Hsp90-independent functions in EGFR trafficking (Haag2020The).

Additionally, CHORDC1 interacts with the classical swine fever virus non-structural protein 5A (NS5A), potentially affecting host cell functions by modulating stress response and protein degradation pathways (Zhang2014Screening).
