# KLK2

## Overview
KLK2, or kallikrein-related peptidase 2, is a gene that encodes a serine protease predominantly expressed in the prostate gland. The protein product of KLK2, also known as kallikrein-related peptidase 2, plays a vital role in reproductive physiology by facilitating the liquefaction of seminal plasma, which is essential for sperm motility and successful fertilization (Mavridis2010Prognostic; Emami2007New). As a member of the kallikrein family, KLK2 is involved in various physiological and pathological processes, including cancer progression, particularly in prostate cancer, where it serves as a significant biomarker (Dorn2013Clinical; Clements2004The). The regulation of KLK2 activity is tightly controlled by endogenous inhibitors, ensuring its precise function in the extracellular space (Yousef2005Human). Due to its involvement in complex signaling networks, KLK2 is considered a potential therapeutic target in prostate-related diseases (Kryza2016The).

## Structure
KLK2 (kallikrein-related peptidase 2) is a serine protease encoded by the KLK2 gene. The primary structure of KLK2 consists of a single polypeptide chain that includes a signal peptide and a pro-peptide, which are cleaved to activate the enzyme (Adamopoulos2019Discovery). The secondary structure of KLK2 typically involves alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its trypsin-like serine protease domain (Adamopoulos2019Discovery). The tertiary structure is characterized by a conserved catalytic triad composed of histidine, aspartate, and serine residues, which is typical of serine proteases (Adamopoulos2019Discovery). KLK2 may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can affect its activity and stability (Adamopoulos2019Discovery).

KLK2 is known to form homodimers, indicating a quaternary structure that may influence its enzymatic function (Adamopoulos2019Discovery). The gene exhibits a high degree of alternative splicing, resulting in multiple splice variant isoforms, some of which may alter the functional properties of the protein (Adamopoulos2019Discovery). These splice variants include both protein-coding and non-coding transcripts, with some variants being specific to prostate cancer cell lines (Adamopoulos2019Discovery).

## Function
KLK2, or kallikrein-related peptidase 2, is a serine protease primarily expressed in the prostate gland, where it plays a crucial role in reproductive physiology. In healthy human cells, KLK2 is involved in the liquefaction of seminal plasma by hydrolyzing seminal vesicle proteins such as seminogelin I and II, and fibronectin, which are essential for sperm motility (Mavridis2010Prognostic; Emami2007New). This proteolytic activity facilitates the breakdown of seminal clots, enhancing sperm motility and contributing to successful fertilization (Adamopoulos2019Discovery).

KLK2 is synthesized as an inactive proenzyme and requires activation through cleavage at specific sites, typically by trypsin-like enzymes. This activation can occur both intracellularly and extracellularly, allowing KLK2 to perform its proteolytic functions in the extracellular space (Lundwall2008Kallikreinrelated; Yousef2005Human). The activity of KLK2 is tightly regulated by endogenous inhibitors, such as protein C inhibitor and α1-antichymotrypsin, which form complexes with KLK2 to control its proteolytic activity and ensure precise spatial and temporal function (Yousef2005Human). These regulatory mechanisms are crucial for maintaining normal physiological processes and preventing aberrant proteolysis.

## Clinical Significance
KLK2, or kallikrein related peptidase 2, is primarily associated with prostate cancer, where it serves as a significant biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis. Alterations in KLK2 expression are linked to prostate cancer progression, with elevated levels often observed in malignant prostate tissues (Dorn2013Clinical; Clements2004The). KLK2 is involved in androgen receptor activation, contributing to cell proliferation in prostate cancer (Kryza2016The). Despite its role in cancer progression, KLK2 expression does not correlate with aggressive phenotypes or poor outcomes, but it is associated with an immunosuppressive environment that may affect the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (PaniaguaHerranz2024Genomic).

In benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), genetic variations in the KLK2 gene have been observed, suggesting a potential role in disease progression. These variations include nucleotide polymorphisms that may regulate gene expression (Dawood2018Physiological). KLK2 is also expressed in breast cancer, although its diagnostic or prognostic value in this context has not been fully explored (Yousef2001The). Overall, KLK2's expression and genetic variations are crucial in understanding its role in prostate-related diseases and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
KLK2, a kallikrein-related peptidase, engages in various interactions with other proteins, playing significant roles in physiological and pathological processes. KLK2 interacts with Antithrombin III (AT) and Proteinase C Inhibitor (PCI), with heparin enhancing its inhibition by AT and reducing the inhibition constant of PCI, leading to a substantial portion of KLK2 being complexed with PCI in seminal plasma (Goettig2010Natural). KLK2 also forms complexes with alpha-2-macroglobulin (a2M) in serum, which is significant in the context of prostate cancer (Goettig2010Natural).

In cancer progression, KLK2 is involved in androgen receptor (AR) activation in prostate cancer by interacting with the AR co-regulator ARA70, leading to AR trans-activation (Kryza2016The). It also participates in the uPA-uPAR signaling pathway by cleaving and activating single-chain uPA, which is involved in plasminogen activation and extracellular matrix component cleavage (Emami2007New). KLK2 can initiate phosphorylation of ERK1/2 via PAR 2, contributing to cancer progression (Oikonomopoulou2010Kallikreinrelated). These interactions highlight KLK2's role in complex signaling networks and its potential as a therapeutic target.
