# AKAP8L

## Overview
AKAP8L, or A-kinase anchoring protein 8 like, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, primarily through its role as a scaffolding protein. The AKAP8L protein is part of the A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) family, which is known for its ability to bind to the regulatory subunits of protein kinase A (PKA) and confine the enzyme to specific locations within the cell. This localization is crucial for the spatial and temporal regulation of PKA signaling pathways. AKAP8L is implicated in the regulation of mRNA stability and cellular metabolism, influencing cancer progression and neuroinflammatory conditions. It interacts with key molecular players such as Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) mRNA and the mTORC1 complex, highlighting its role in cancer stemness and diabetes-associated cognitive impairment (Zhang2024Microglial; Zhang2022AKAP8L). The gene's expression and genetic alterations have significant clinical implications, serving as a biomarker for various cancers and offering potential targets for therapeutic interventions (Zhou2023Integrative).

## Clinical Significance
AKAP8L has been identified as a significant biomarker in various cancers, with its expression levels and genetic alterations playing crucial roles in disease progression and prognosis. In gastric cancer, AKAP8L is upregulated in chemoresistant tumors and is associated with poor prognosis. It enhances the stemness and chemoresistance of gastric cancer cells by stabilizing SCD1 mRNA, which is crucial for maintaining cancer stem cell properties (Zhang2022AKAP8L). High AKAP8L expression is linked to poor differentiation and overall survival in gastric cancer patients (Zhang2022AKAP8L).

In a pan-cancer context, AKAP8L is upregulated in multiple cancer types and is associated with tumor initiation and progression. It serves as a prognostic biomarker, with higher expression correlating with worse outcomes in cancers such as colon adenocarcinoma, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), and prostate adenocarcinoma (Zhou2023Integrative). Specifically, in KIRC, AKAP8L expression is linked to worse overall survival, disease-specific survival, and progression-free interval, and is associated with various clinical characteristics such as sex, race, and histological grade (Zhou2023Integrative). These findings suggest that AKAP8L could be a potential target for precision oncology and therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
AKAP8L is involved in several critical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, influencing various cellular processes. In gastric cancer cells, AKAP8L interacts with Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) mRNA, stabilizing it through an IGF2BP1-dependent mechanism. This interaction is crucial for enhancing the stemness and chemoresistance of gastric cancer cells by promoting lipid metabolism in cancer stem cells (Zhang2022AKAP8La; Zhang2022AKAP8L). AKAP8L binds to SCD1 mRNA, and this binding is facilitated by IGF2BP1, an m6A 'reader' protein, which is essential for mRNA stability (Zhang2022AKAP8La).

In microglial cells, AKAP8L interacts with the mTORC1 complex, specifically with the Raptor subunit, under high glucose conditions. This interaction is significant in the context of diabetes-associated cognitive impairment, as it affects autophagy and neuroinflammation (Zhang2024Microglial). The interaction between AKAP8L and mTORC1 is enhanced under these conditions, contributing to the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment (Zhang2024Microglial).

These interactions highlight AKAP8L's role in regulating mRNA stability and cellular metabolism, impacting cancer progression and neuroinflammatory conditions.
