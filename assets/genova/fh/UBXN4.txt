# UBXN4

## Overview
UBXN4 is a gene that encodes the UBX domain protein 4, also known as Erasin, which is a member of the UBX domain protein family. This protein is primarily involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, where it functions as an essential membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). UBX domain protein 4 serves as a platform to recruit valosin-containing protein (VCP), facilitating the degradation of misfolded or unfolded proteins, thereby maintaining protein quality control and cellular homeostasis (Guo2023Role). Beyond its role in ERAD, UBX domain protein 4 is implicated in various cellular processes, including autophagy and endosomal sorting, and has been associated with modulating proliferation and apoptosis pathways (Rezvani2016UBXD). The protein is highly expressed in most healthy tissues, underscoring its importance in normal cellular functions (Yang2024Exploring). In the context of cancer, UBX domain protein 4 has been noted for its potential role in tumorigenesis and as a prognostic marker, particularly in lung cancer (Yang2024Exploring).

## Function
UBXN4, also known as Erasin, is a protein that plays a significant role in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, a critical process for maintaining protein quality control within cells. It functions as an essential membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it serves as a platform to recruit valosin-containing protein (VCP), facilitating the degradation of misfolded or unfolded proteins under stress conditions (Guo2023Role). This activity is crucial for maintaining ER function and cellular homeostasis.

UBXN4 is part of the UBXD family, which interacts with the AAA-ATPase p97/VCP, a key player in protein degradation pathways (Rezvani2016UBXD). The protein is highly expressed in most healthy tissues, indicating its importance in normal cellular functions (Yang2024Exploring). UBXN4 is involved in various cellular processes beyond ERAD, including autophagy and endosomal sorting, and has been implicated in modulating proliferation and apoptosis pathways, which are vital for cell survival and function (Rezvani2016UBXD).

In the context of cancer, UBXN4 has been noted for its moderate to strong cytoplasmic immunoreactivity in malignant cells, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis and potential as a prognostic marker (Yang2024Exploring). However, its specific functions in healthy human cells remain less clearly defined.

## Clinical Significance
UBXN4 has been implicated in cancer, particularly in lung cancer, where its expression levels are negatively correlated with macrophage-related markers, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Yang2024Exploring). In various cancers, UBXN4 shows varying degrees of cytoplasmic or nuclear immunoreactivity, with moderate to strong cytoplasmic immune reactivity observed in most malignant cells (Yang2024Exploring). The expression of UBXN4, along with other UBXD family proteins, is associated with cancer progression and patient survival, indicating its potential as a biomarker for cancer prognosis and treatment response (Yang2024Exploring).

UBXN4 is also involved in the regulation of the WNT secretory factor EVI/WLS at the protein level, which is significant in cellular processes related to cancer (Yang2024Exploring). Although specific diseases or conditions directly related to UBXN4 gene mutations or interaction changes are not detailed, its role in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway and interactions with the p97/VCP protein suggest its involvement in protein quality control, which is crucial in cancer-related pathways (Rezvani2016UBXD). The therapeutic potential of targeting UBXN4 in cancer treatment is highlighted, given its involvement in tumorigenic pathways (Rezvani2016UBXD).

## Interactions
UBXN4, a member of the UBX domain protein family, is known to interact with the valosin-containing protein (VCP), also known as p97. This interaction is crucial for its role in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, where UBXN4 acts as a platform to recruit VCP to the endoplasmic reticulum, facilitating the degradation of misfolded proteins and maintaining ER homeostasis (Guo2023Role). UBXN4 is part of the SAKS1 subfamily and is characterized by a unique domain architecture that includes a membrane insertion domain following the UBX domain, which may influence its interaction with other proteins (Schuberth2008UBX).

In the context of cancer, UBXN4 has been identified as having a negative correlation with macrophage-related markers, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic marker for lung cancer. It is also involved in regulating the WNT secretory factor EVI/WLS at the protein level, highlighting its significance in cellular processes related to cancer biology (Yang2024Exploring). Additionally, UBXN4 mutants in C. elegans have shown increased polyQ aggregates, indicating a possible role in polyQ aggregation linked to ERAD inhibition (Mukkavalli2020The).
