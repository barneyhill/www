# ELOA2

## Overview
ELOA2 is a gene that encodes the protein elongin A2, a component of the elongin complex involved in transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II. The elongin complex, which includes elongin A2, B, and C, functions to enhance the transcriptional activity of RNA polymerase II by mitigating transient pauses during the elongation phase, thereby promoting efficient gene expression. Elongin A2 is categorized as a transcriptional regulatory protein and is primarily active in the nucleus, where it plays a significant role in regulating gene expression, impacting cellular processes such as growth, differentiation, and response to environmental stimuli. The protein's interactions with other components of the transcription machinery, such as RNA polymerase II and the IWS1 protein, underscore its critical role in transcriptional dynamics (Chen2023Structure; Cermakova2021A).

## Structure


## Function
ELOA2 (elongin A2) is a gene that encodes a subunit of the elongin complex, which plays a crucial role in transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II. This complex enhances the transcription rate by suppressing transient pausing of the polymerase, thereby facilitating efficient gene expression. ELOA2 is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the regulation of gene expression, impacting various cellular processes such as growth and differentiation.

In the context of human lens epithelial (HLE) cells, ELOA2 has been shown to exhibit dose-rate main effects when exposed to X-ray radiation, indicating its expression is significantly affected by the rate of radiation exposure. This suggests a potential role in the cellular response to radiation, which could be relevant to understanding cataract formation (Chauhan2020In).

Additionally, ELOA2 has been identified as one of the genes expressed in human germ cells, including spermatogonia, spermatocyte, and spermatid, suggesting a role in male reproductive biology (Robertson2020Largescale). In zebrafish, ELOA2 is downregulated in amh mutant testes, indicating its involvement in Leydig cell function or testosterone biosynthesis (Yan2019A).

## Clinical Significance
ELOA2 (elongin A2) has been studied in various contexts, particularly in relation to cancer and other conditions. In cancer research, ELOA2 has been identified as potentially essential due to its proximity to known driver genes, such as BCL2 in B-lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoma. This apparent essentiality is attributed to proximity bias, where telomeric truncations delete true driver genes, leading to false-positive dependency calls (Lazar2024Highresolution). 

In zebrafish models, ELOA2 is downregulated in amh mutant testes, indicating its role in Leydig cell function. This downregulation suggests a disruption in Leydig cell specification, proliferation, or functioning due to the loss of amh function, which may lead to partial feminization of the testes (Yan2019A).

ELOA2 expression is also affected by radiation exposure in human lens epithelial cells. It is up-regulated in low dose-rate exposures and down-regulated in high dose-rate exposures, indicating its involvement in radiation-induced cataractogenesis (Chauhan2020In).

While ELOA2 has been identified with variants in familial cancer studies, specific diseases or conditions directly associated with mutations in ELOA2 have not been detailed (Pinheiro2020Germline).

## Interactions
ELOA2, a subunit of the elongin complex, participates in several interactions crucial for transcription elongation. It forms a heterotrimeric complex with elongin B (ELOB) and elongin C (ELOC), which enhances the transcriptional activity of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) by stimulating its elongation process (Chen2023Structure). ELOA2 binds to the RPB2 side of Pol II, anchoring the ELOB-ELOC subunit heterodimer and inducing conformational changes near the polymerase active center, which are necessary for its elongation-stimulatory activity (Chen2023Structure).

The interaction of ELOA2 with Pol II is mediated through specific residues, and its C-terminal region is crucial for its function in transcription elongation (Chen2023Structure). ELOA2's binding to Pol II is incompatible with other complexes such as the super elongation complex and PAF1 complex, indicating its unique role in transcription regulation (Chen2023Structure).

ELOA2 also interacts with the IWS1 protein, which contains TND (Transcriptional Network Domain) and TIM (Transcriptional Interaction Module) motifs. This interaction is part of a network involving other proteins like TFIIS and PPP1R10, which are involved in transcription elongation dynamics (Cermakova2021A). These interactions are mediated by hydrophobic contacts and electrostatic interactions, with phosphorylation potentially modulating their affinity (Cermakova2021A).
