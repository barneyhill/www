# CECR2

## Overview
CECR2 (Cat Eye Syndrome Chromosome Region, Candidate 2) is a gene that encodes the CECR2 histone acetyl-lysine reader protein, which is a crucial component in chromatin remodeling processes. The CECR2 protein is characterized by its bromodomain, a specialized motif that recognizes acetylated lysine residues on histone tails, thereby influencing gene expression and chromatin structure. This protein is predominantly expressed in the neural system and plays a significant role in embryonic development, particularly in neurulation and brain formation. CECR2 is involved in the DNA damage response and somatic cell reprogramming, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular functions and development. Mutations in the CECR2 gene have been linked to neural tube defects and Cat Eye Syndrome, underscoring its clinical significance in congenital malformations (Dicipulo2021Cecr2; Flynn2015A; Park2020Cytotoxic).

## Structure
The CECR2 protein is characterized by its bromodomain, which plays a crucial role in recognizing acetylated lysine residues on histone tails, influencing chromatin remodeling and gene expression. The bromodomain of CECR2 features a conserved asparagine anchor residue and a tyrosine gatekeeper, which allows for a larger binding pocket compared to other bromodomains with isoleucine or valine gatekeepers. This structural feature enables CECR2 to specifically bind butyryllysine modifications (Flynn2015A).

The binding pocket of CECR2 is formed by a long ZA loop and a short BC loop, with a hydrophobic gatekeeper residue interacting with the acetyllysine side chain. The presence of a tyrosine gatekeeper and a core methionine is critical for the high-affinity recognition of butyryllysine (Flynn2015A). The CECR2 bromodomain also includes a WPF shelf, formed by residues W457, P458, and F459, which contributes to its ligand-binding specificity (Lucas2020Optimization).

CECR2 is involved in chromatin remodeling and has implications in oncology, with its bromodomain playing a role in the formation of γ-H2AX foci in response to DNA double-strand breaks (Lucas2020Optimization). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as acetylation, and is associated with various splice variant isoforms, contributing to its functional diversity. However, specific details about the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of CECR2 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
CECR2 is a chromatin remodeling protein that plays a significant role in regulating gene expression by recognizing acetylated lysine residues on histone tails, thereby influencing DNA accessibility. It is a major component of the CERF complex, which is involved in chromatin remodeling activities essential for various cellular processes (Elliott2020Reported; Park2020Cytotoxic). CECR2 is predominantly expressed in the neural system and is crucial for neurulation and brain development during embryogenesis (Park2020Cytotoxic). It forms complexes with SNF2L and SNF2H, which are part of the ISWI family of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers, contributing to transcriptional regulation and chromatin structure reorganization (Park2020Cytotoxic).

In healthy human cells, CECR2 is involved in the DNA damage response, although its exact cellular functions remain largely unknown (Park2020Cytotoxic). It is also implicated in somatic cell reprogramming by reorganizing chromatin structure, which is crucial for the transition to pluripotency (Wu2021The). CECR2's role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CECR2 gene are associated with neural tube defects (NTDs), which are serious congenital malformations resulting from incomplete closure of the neural tube during embryonic development. Specific mutations such as p.Gly868Arg, p.Glu327Val, and p.Thr521Ser have been identified in patients with varying clinical features of NTDs, including spina bifida and atypical phenotypes like C2-3 vertebral fusion. These mutations lead to significantly lower CECR2 expression, particularly when combined with high homocysteine levels, suggesting a gene-environment interaction in the development of NTDs (Bai2023Double).

CECR2 is also implicated in Cat Eye Syndrome (CES), a genetic disorder characterized by a highly variable phenotype, including coloboma, heart defects, and skeletal abnormalities. In mice, deleterious loss of function mutations in Cecr2 demonstrate features similar to those in human CES patients, such as coloboma and specific skeletal, kidney, and heart defects. This suggests that CECR2 is involved in the abnormal features of CES, and Cecr2 mutant mice serve as a model system to study the wide range of phenotypes present in CES (Dicipulo2021Cecr2).

## Interactions
CECR2 interacts with the RELA protein, a member of the NF-κB family, through its bromodomain, which specifically recognizes acetylated lysine-310 on RELA. This interaction is crucial for the activation of NF-κB target genes, such as CSF1 and CXCL1, which are involved in cancer metastasis. CECR2 does not alter the abundance of NF-κB family proteins but is recruited by RELA to the promoters of these target genes, enhancing transcriptional activation and RNA Polymerase II recruitment (Zhang2022CECR2; Zhang2020CECR2).

CECR2 also forms a chromatin remodeling complex with SNF2L and SNF2H, which increases chromatin accessibility and modulates the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes and NF-κB target genes. This interaction is significant for the recruitment and polarization of tumor-associated macrophages, promoting breast cancer metastasis (Zhang2022CECR2).

Pharmacological inhibitors targeting the CECR2 bromodomain, such as NVS-CECR2-1 and GNE-886, can disrupt the interaction between CECR2 and RELA, leading to reduced expression of NF-κB target genes and decreased cancer cell migration and invasion (Zhang2022CECR2; Zhang2020CECR2).
