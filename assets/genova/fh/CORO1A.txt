# CORO1A

## Overview
The CORO1A gene encodes the protein coronin 1A, which is a member of the coronin family of proteins. Coronin 1A is primarily involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, a critical component of cellular structure and function. As an actin-binding protein, coronin 1A plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including cell motility, immune cell signaling, and cytoskeletal organization. It is particularly significant in immune cells such as T lymphocytes and natural killer cells, where it modulates actin dynamics and signaling pathways essential for immune responses. Mutations in the CORO1A gene can lead to immunodeficiency disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining immune system integrity (Mugnier2008Coronin1A; CastroCastro2011Coronin; Mace2014Lytic).

## Structure
Coronin 1A (Coro1A) is a protein characterized by a complex structure that includes several distinct domains. The N-terminal region of Coro1A contains a β-propeller domain composed of seven WD40 repeats, spanning residues 1-352, which is capable of binding F-actin (Ojeda2015The). This domain is crucial for actin binding and is affected by mutations such as E26K, which enhance actin-binding and bundling activities (Shiow2008The; Ojeda2015The). Following the β-propeller domain, there is a C-terminal extension that includes both conserved and unique sequences relative to other family members (Ojeda2015The). Coro1A also features a distal coiled-coil region, residues 429-461, which interacts with the Arp2/3 complex, playing a role in actin regulation (Ojeda2015The).

Coro1A is involved in the regulation of Rac1 signaling, forming complexes with proteins such as ArhGEF7 and Pak1, which facilitate the dissociation of the RhoGDIa/Rac1 complex (CastroCastro2011Coronin). The protein's function is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, although specific details on these modifications and splice variant isoforms are not provided in the context (CastroCastro2011Coronin).

## Function
Coronin 1A (CORO1A) is a protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which is crucial for various cellular processes such as cell motility, phagocytosis, and immune responses. In healthy human cells, CORO1A is involved in the translocation and activation of Rac1, a small GTPase that regulates cytoskeletal dynamics. CORO1A facilitates a cytoskeletal-based feedback loop that promotes Rac1 translocation to the plasma membrane, where it becomes activated. This process is essential for proper cell signaling and cytoskeletal organization (CastroCastro2011Coronin).

CORO1A is also critical in T lymphocytes, where it regulates actin dynamics and T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling. It interacts with the Arp2/3 complex to modulate F-actin polymerization, which is vital for T cell mobility and viability. The absence of CORO1A leads to defects in TCR-triggered cell division and signaling pathways, affecting T cell function and survival (Mugnier2008Coronin1A).

In natural killer (NK) cells, CORO1A is necessary for the function of the lytic immune synapse, facilitating the penetration of lytic granules through the F-actin cortex, which is crucial for effective cytotoxic activity (Mace2014Lytic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CORO1A gene are associated with a range of immunodeficiency disorders. Complete absence of coronin 1A due to mutations can lead to severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), characterized by severe T lymphocytopenia and increased susceptibility to infections (Shiow2008The; Moshous2014The). Hypomorphic mutations in CORO1A result in milder phenotypes, such as defects in naïve T cells and expansion of oligoclonal memory T cells, increasing susceptibility to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated B cell lymphoproliferation (Moshous2013Wholeexome; Moshous2014The).

Specific mutations, such as the CORO1A S401fs mutation, are linked to CD4+ lymphopenia and recurrent viral infections, including varicella and chronic warts caused by human papillomavirus (Yee2016Recurrent). These mutations disrupt the protein's oligomerization and cytoskeletal association, impairing T-cell survival and migration (Yee2016Recurrent).

Compound heterozygous mutations in CORO1A can lead to a mucocutaneous-immunodeficiency syndrome, characterized by conditions like epidermodysplasia verruciformis-HPV and granulomatous tuberculoid leprosy (StrayPedersen2014Compound). These mutations affect immune cell morphology and function, particularly impacting T, B, and NK cells (StrayPedersen2014Compound).

## Interactions
Coronin 1A (CORO1A) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in actin cytoskeleton dynamics and cell signaling. CORO1A forms a complex with ArhGEF7, Pak1, and RhoGDIa, which is essential for the dissociation of the inhibitory RhoGDIa/Rac1 complex during cell signaling. This interaction facilitates Rac1 translocation to the plasma membrane and its activation (CastroCastro2011Coronin). ArhGEF7 is a critical component for the interaction of CORO1A with Pak1 and RhoGDIa, and its absence disrupts the formation of the CORO1A/Pak1/RhoGDIa complex (CastroCastro2011Coronin).

CORO1A also interacts with F-actin, stabilizing it by bridging adjacent actin protomers and stapling opposite strands of the actin filament. This interaction involves specific binding sites on F-actin, including SD1, SD2, and SD4 (Galkin2008Coronin1A). The E26K mutation in CORO1A enhances its interaction with actin isoforms and affects its actin-binding and bundling activity, promoting the aggregation of polymerized actin filaments (Ojeda2015The).

In T lymphocytes, CORO1A interacts with protein kinase C-θ (PKCθ), negatively interfering with PKCθ-dependent NF-κB, Cyclin D1, and IL-2 transactivation. This interaction is mediated by the NH2-terminal WD40 domains of CORO1A and the C2-like domain of PKCθ (Siegmund2015Novel).
