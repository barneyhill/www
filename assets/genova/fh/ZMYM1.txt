# ZMYM1

## Overview
ZMYM1 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger MYM-type containing 1 protein, which is primarily involved in transcriptional regulation within the nucleus of human cells. This protein is characterized by its MYM-type zinc finger domains, which facilitate DNA binding and protein-protein interactions, playing a crucial role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. Through these mechanisms, ZMYM1 influences cellular differentiation and development, contributing to the maintenance of normal cellular functions. The gene's involvement in transcriptional regulation and its potential interactions with other proteins, such as those in response to doxorubicin treatment and in chromatin organization, highlight its significance in complex biological processes and its potential implications in conditions like neuroblastoma (Tabar2024Intrinsically; TAYMAZNİKEREL2022Doxorubicininduced; Tirelli2024Integrative).

## Function
ZMYM1 (zinc finger MYM-type containing 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in transcriptional regulation, primarily active in the nucleus of healthy human cells. The protein contains MYM-type zinc finger domains, which are crucial for its ability to bind DNA and facilitate protein-protein interactions. These interactions are essential for its role in chromatin remodeling, a process that alters the structure of chromatin to regulate gene expression. By modulating gene expression, ZMYM1 plays a significant role in cellular differentiation and development, influencing various molecular processes necessary for maintaining normal cellular functions. The activity of ZMYM1 in the nucleus underscores its importance in orchestrating the complex network of gene regulation, ensuring that genes are expressed at the right time and in the appropriate context to support healthy cellular and organismal outcomes.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
ZMYM1 is involved in transcriptional regulation and may participate in protein-protein interactions, although specific interactions are not extensively detailed. It is part of a network of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified in response to doxorubicin treatment across various cancer types, suggesting its involvement in complex protein interactions (TAYMAZNİKEREL2022Doxorubicininduced). ZMYM1 is enriched with CHD9, a member of the Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding (CHD) family, indicating a potential role in chromatin organization and gene regulation (Tabar2024Intrinsically). Despite these associations, the specific physical interactions of ZMYM1 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not explicitly detailed in the available context. The gene is also implicated in neuroblastoma risk, identified through integrative genomic analyses, but again, specific interaction partners are not mentioned (Tirelli2024Integrative). While ZMYM1 shares structural similarities with other ZMYM family members, such as ZMYM2 and ZMYM3, which are known to interact with various proteins, direct evidence of ZMYM1's interactions remains limited (Kojima2011Crypton).
