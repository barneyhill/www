# EMC2

## Overview
EMC2 is a gene that encodes the ER membrane protein complex subunit 2, a crucial component of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein complex (EMC). This protein is characterized by its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which facilitate protein-protein interactions essential for the assembly and stability of the EMC. As a cytosolic scaffold, EMC2 plays a pivotal role in the biogenesis of membrane proteins by stabilizing the EMC and assisting in the insertion and folding of transmembrane domains (TMDs) into the ER membrane. This function is vital for maintaining protein homeostasis and ensuring the correct topology of membrane proteins, which is critical for cellular and organismal homeostasis (Pleiner2021WNK1; MillerVedam2020Structural). The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to various diseases, including cancer, where it influences prognosis and immune cell infiltration in tumors (Liu2021The).

## Structure
EMC2 is a subunit of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein complex (EMC) and plays a crucial role in its structure and function. The primary structure of EMC2 includes a series of tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs), which are motifs known for facilitating protein-protein interactions (MillerVedam2020Structural). The secondary structure of EMC2 is characterized by 15 α-helices that form a right-handed spiral, contributing to its TPR arrangement (Bai2020Structure). This helical fold is a key feature of EMC2, providing a scaffold for interactions with other EMC subunits (MillerVedam2020Structural).

In terms of tertiary structure, EMC2 forms an alpha-solenoid structure, which is a common fold for proteins involved in scaffolding functions (MillerVedam2020Structural). The quaternary structure of EMC2 involves its integration into the EMC, where it interacts with other subunits such as EMC3, EMC4, and EMC5, forming a stable complex essential for membrane protein biogenesis (Hegde2022The; Pleiner2021WNK1).

EMC2's interactions are modulated by its TPR motifs, which are crucial for the assembly and stability of the EMC complex. These interactions are vital for the EMC's role in the insertion and folding of transmembrane proteins (MillerVedam2020Structural).

## Function
EMC2 is a critical component of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein complex (EMC), which plays a significant role in the biogenesis of membrane proteins. EMC2 functions as a cytosolic scaffold within the EMC, stabilizing the complex by interacting with other subunits such as EMC8, EMC3, and EMC5. This stabilization is crucial for the proper assembly and function of the EMC, which is involved in the insertion of transmembrane domains (TMDs) into the ER membrane (MillerVedam2020Structural; Pleiner2021WNK1).

EMC2 is characterized by its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which facilitate interactions with other EMC components, forming a structural framework essential for the complex's integrity. These interactions are vital for the insertion and folding of multi-pass and tail-anchored membrane proteins, processes that are independent of the Sec61 complex (Hegde2022The; Volkmar2020Squaring).

In healthy human cells, EMC2's role in the EMC is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis and ensuring the correct topology of membrane proteins, which is essential for cellular function and organismal homeostasis (Chitwood2019The; Pleiner2021WNK1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the EMC2 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In cancer, EMC2 is differentially expressed across multiple types, with high expression linked to poor prognosis in breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA), bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA), and uveal melanoma (UVM). Conversely, high EMC2 expression is associated with better outcomes in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) (Liu2021The). EMC2 mutations are most frequently observed in ovarian and breast cancers, although these mutations do not significantly affect survival in breast cancer (Liu2021The).

The gene's expression is also correlated with immune cell infiltration in tumors, suggesting a role in the tumor immune microenvironment, which may impact the efficacy of immunotherapy (Liu2021The). EMC2's involvement in drug resistance and tumor growth is highlighted by its co-expression with oncogenes and drug resistance genes, making it a potential therapeutic target (Liu2021The).

Beyond cancer, EMC2's role in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein complex suggests that its dysfunction could contribute to diseases related to protein misfolding and stability, such as cystic fibrosis and other conditions involving membrane protein biogenesis (Chitwood2019The).

## Interactions
EMC2 is a critical component of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein complex (EMC) and participates in various protein-protein interactions essential for its function. EMC2 forms stable heterodimeric complexes with either EMC8 or EMC9, but not both simultaneously, which are involved in the insertion of tail-anchored proteins into membranes (O’Donnell2020The). The interaction between EMC2 and EMC8 or EMC9 is mutually exclusive due to overlapping binding sites on EMC2 (Pleiner2021WNK1). EMC2 also interacts with other EMC subunits, such as EMC1, EMC3, and EMC6, playing a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the membrane domain of the EMC (O’Donnell2020The).

EMC2's interaction with WNK1, an assembly factor for the EMC, is significant as WNK1 binds to EMC2 using a conserved amphipathic alpha-helix, shielding the hydrophobic interface between EMC2 and EMC8, thus preventing promiscuous interactions and stabilizing unassembled EMC2 (Pleiner2021WNK1). This interaction is kinase-independent and allows EMC8 to displace WNK1 for proper EMC assembly (Pleiner2021WNK1). EMC2 is also implicated in the ER-associated degradation pathway, interacting with proteins such as UBAC2 and Derlin-2, suggesting a role in the quality control of membrane proteins (Volkmar2020Squaring).
