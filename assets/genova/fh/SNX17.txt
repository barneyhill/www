# SNX17

## Overview
Sorting nexin 17 (SNX17) is a gene that encodes the protein sorting nexin 17, which is a member of the sorting nexin family involved in endosomal sorting and trafficking. The protein is characterized by a Phox homology (PX) domain and a FERM-like domain, which facilitate its role in membrane association and protein interactions, respectively (Teasdale2011Insights; van2005Sorting). SNX17 is integral to the endocytic pathway, where it regulates the recycling of various receptors, including the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) and β1 integrin receptor, by interacting with the Retriever complex and other proteins (Dhawan2020Sorting). The protein's interactions with transmembrane proteins and cytoplasmic adaptors are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and receptor recycling (Stiegler2014Structural; van2005Sorting). SNX17 has clinical significance in cardiovascular health, particularly in conditions such as atrial fibrillation and doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, and may also play a role in cancer through its involvement in cellular signaling pathways (Zhang2021SNX17; Singla2024Structural; Geng2019SNX17).

## Structure
Sorting nexin 17 (SNX17) is characterized by a Phox homology (PX) domain and a FERM-like domain, which are crucial for its function in endosomal sorting and trafficking. The PX domain binds phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P), facilitating membrane association (van2005Sorting). The FERM domain of SNX17 is approximately 300 amino acids long and consists of three subdomains: F1, F2, and F3. The F1 subdomain has a ubiquitin-like fold, while the F3 subdomain is structurally similar to pleckstrin homology (PH) and phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains (Teasdale2011Insights). The F2 lobe is unique among FERM domains as it lacks the standard helix α3B (Stiegler2014Structural).

The FERM domain extends to residue 388, which is necessary for binding to proteins such as P-selectin and KRIT1 (Stiegler2014Structural). SNX17 interacts with transmembrane proteins via NPxY sequences through its FERM domain and binds to SH3 domain proteins through a polyproline sequence in the PX domain (Teasdale2011Insights). The C-terminal region of SNX17, specifically the sequence 463 EGIGDEDL 470, interacts with the PDZ domain of PDLIM7, forming a complex that is stabilized by specific electrostatic interactions (Healy2021Proteomic). The structure of SNX17 facilitates its role in endosomal trafficking and receptor recycling.

## Function
Sorting nexin 17 (SNX17) is a crucial protein involved in endosomal sorting and recycling processes in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in the endocytic pathway by interacting with a variety of receptors in a sequence-specific manner to regulate their recycling. SNX17 is essential for the recycling of receptors such as the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) and β1 integrin receptor, attaching to the sorting endosome (SE) via its Phox homology (PX) domain and interacting with the Retriever complex through its FERM domain (Dhawan2020Sorting).

SNX17 is also involved in the process of endosomal fission, where it couples with Eps15 homology domain protein 1 (EHD1) to facilitate the fission of vesicles from the SE. This interaction is crucial for normal receptor recycling, and the depletion of EHD1 results in enlarged SE structures, indicating its role in SE fission (Dhawan2020Sorting). SNX17's interaction with the NPxY motif in the cytoplasmic tail of LRP1 is critical for its recycling, preventing the receptor from being sorted to the lysosomal degradation pathway (van2005Sorting). This function is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and receptor recycling in healthy human cells (van2005Sorting).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or deficiencies in the SNX17 gene have been linked to several cardiovascular conditions, particularly atrial fibrillation (AF). SNX17 plays a critical role in cardiac electrophysiology by regulating the endocytic trafficking of the Kv1.5 potassium channel. Deficiency in SNX17 leads to increased surface expression of Kv1.5, resulting in shortened action potential duration in atrial myocytes and heightened susceptibility to AF (Geng2019SNX17). This suggests that SNX17 mutations could alter cardiac electrical properties, increasing the risk of AF (Geng2019SNX17).

SNX17 also has a protective role against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Downregulation of SNX17 exacerbates cardiac damage, including myocardial damage and fibrosis, by promoting the degradation of leiomodin-2 (LMOD2), a regulator of muscle thin filament length. This degradation occurs via the lysosomal pathway, worsening cardiac dysfunction (Zhang2021SNX17). SNX17 deficiency increases susceptibility to cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmia post-myocardial infarction, highlighting its broader significance in cardiovascular health (Zhang2021SNX17).

Alterations in SNX17 expression or its interactions may also have implications in cancer, as mutations in the SNX17 binding pocket are associated with disruptions in cellular signaling and protein homeostasis, potentially contributing to oncogenic processes (Singla2024Structural).

## Interactions
Sorting nexin 17 (SNX17) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in endosomal sorting and trafficking. SNX17 interacts with the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) through the NPxY motif in the LRP cytoplasmic tail, facilitating its recycling from early endosomes (van2005Sorting). This interaction is essential for preventing LRP degradation and ensuring its proper cell surface distribution (van2005Sorting).

SNX17 also associates with the Retriever complex, specifically binding to the VPS35L and VPS26C subunits through its C-terminal tail. This interaction is critical for the recycling of SNX17-dependent cargos and maintaining plasma membrane protein homeostasis (Singla2024Structural).

Additionally, SNX17 interacts with PDLIM family proteins, such as PDLIM1, PDLIM4, and PDLIM7, through its C-terminal Type III PDZ binding motif. This interaction is involved in actin cytoskeleton regulation and is mediated by the PDZ domain of PDLIM proteins (Healy2021Proteomic).

SNX17 also binds to the cytoplasmic adaptor protein KRIT1 via its FERM domain, interacting with the NPXF2 motif in KRIT1, which is associated with cerebral cavernous malformations (Stiegler2014Structural).
