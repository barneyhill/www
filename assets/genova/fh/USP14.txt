# USP14

## Overview
USP14 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquitin specific peptidase 14, a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is essential for protein degradation in eukaryotic cells. The USP14 protein is characterized by its ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain and a catalytic domain, which together facilitate its interaction with the 19S regulatory particle of the proteasome, enhancing its deubiquitinating activity (Hu2005Structure). As a cysteine protease, USP14 is involved in the removal of ubiquitin chains from substrates, thereby regulating their degradation and maintaining cellular protein homeostasis (Chadchankar2019Inactive). The enzyme's activity is modulated by phosphorylation and its interaction with the proteasome, which is crucial for its function in various cellular processes, including metabolism and tumorigenesis (Xu2015Phosphorylation). Given its significant role in protein degradation, USP14 is implicated in several diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Lv2021USP14; Marshall2013Genetic).

## Structure
USP14 is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a critical role in protein degradation by the proteasome. The full-length human USP14 protein consists of 494 amino acids and includes a 9-kDa ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain at the N-terminus, followed by a 45-kDa catalytic domain (Hu2005Structure). The catalytic domain is organized into three subdomains: Fingers, Palm, and Thumb, resembling an extended right hand, which creates a binding surface for ubiquitin (Hu2005Structure). The Thumb contains six alpha helices and one short beta strand, while the Palm consists of a central beta sheet, three alpha helices, and several surface loops (Hu2005Structure).

The active site of USP14 includes a catalytic triad composed of Cys114, His435, and Asp451, which is similar to the papain family of cysteine proteases (Hu2005Structure). The enzyme's deubiquitinating activity is regulated by blocking loops BL1 and BL2, which occlude the active site in the absence of the proteasome (Zhang2022USP14regulated; Hu2005Structure). Upon binding to the proteasome, these loops undergo conformational changes, allowing substrate access (Hu2005Structure).

USP14's UBL domain is crucial for its interaction with the proteasome, specifically binding to the 19S regulatory particle, which enhances its deubiquitinating activity (Hu2005Structure). Phosphorylation, particularly at Ser432, influences the conformational dynamics of USP14, stabilizing the blocking loops and enhancing its interaction with ubiquitin and the proteasome (Dash2024Structural).

## Function
USP14 is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a significant role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is crucial for protein degradation in eukaryotic cells. It is associated with the 19S regulatory particle of the proteasome and is involved in the removal of ubiquitin chains from substrates, thereby regulating their degradation (Xu2015Phosphorylation; Chadchankar2019Inactive). USP14 functions as a checkpoint in healthy human cells, preventing non-specific degradation by modulating proteasomal activities. It reduces basal peptidase and ATPase activity in the absence of ubiquitinated substrates and activates these activities when ubiquitin is present, facilitating substrate degradation (Chadchankar2019Inactive).

The UBL domain of USP14 is crucial for its function, as it enhances proteasome activities and promotes the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. This domain acts as an allosteric stimulator, increasing proteasome activities such as peptide hydrolysis and ATPase activity, independent of USP14's catalytic activity (Kim2018UBL). USP14 is also regulated by phosphorylation through the kinase Akt, which enhances its catalytic activity and influences global protein degradation, impacting cellular processes like metabolism and tumorigenesis (Xu2015Phosphorylation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the USP14 gene have significant clinical implications. In the context of neurological diseases, mutations in USP14, such as the ENU-induced nmf375 mutation, lead to adult-onset neurological disorders characterized by muscle weakness and neuromuscular junction (NMJ) abnormalities. These mutations result in a drastic reduction of USP14 levels, affecting ubiquitin pools and synaptic transmission, which are crucial for proper nervous system function (Marshall2013Genetic).

In cancer, USP14 is highly expressed in several types, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), breast cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and tumor progression. In HCC, USP14 stabilizes hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1-α), promoting cell proliferation and migration under hypoxic conditions (Lv2021USP14). In breast cancer, USP14 stabilizes the androgen receptor (AR), and its inhibition leads to growth arrest and apoptosis in AR-positive cells, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Liao2018Growth).

Overall, USP14's role in deubiquitination and protein stabilization makes it a critical factor in the progression of both neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
USP14, a ubiquitin-specific protease, interacts dynamically with the proteasome, a complex responsible for protein degradation. It associates with the 19S regulatory particle of the proteasome, specifically binding to the RPN1 subunit through its ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain. This interaction involves a hydrophobic patch on the UBL domain, engaging several residues on the RPN1 T2 site (Kuo2017Ubiquitinated; Zhang2021Mechanistic). The USP domain of USP14 interacts with the OB and AAA domains of the ATPase ring, with blocking loops (BL1, BL2, and BL3) mediating these interactions (Zhang2021Mechanistic).

USP14 competes with RPN11 for substrate-conjugated ubiquitin, influencing the proteasome's conformational transitions and ATPase activity. This competition affects the pathway of conformational transitions and creates decision-making checkpoints that regulate substrate engagement and translocation (Zhang2022USP14regulated; Zhang2021Mechanistic). USP14's interaction with the AAA domain of RPT1 involves two discrete interfaces, with specific residues facilitating these interactions (Zhang2022USP14regulated).

USP14's binding to the proteasome is influenced by the presence of ubiquitinated proteins, which enhance its association, suggesting a role in actively degrading ubiquitinated substrates (Kuo2017Ubiquitinated). These interactions highlight USP14's critical role in regulating proteasome activity and protein degradation.
