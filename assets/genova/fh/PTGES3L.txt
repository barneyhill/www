# PTGES3L

## Overview
The PTGES3L gene encodes the protein prostaglandin E synthase 3 like, which is involved in the biosynthesis of prostaglandins, a group of physiologically active lipid compounds. This protein is categorized as an enzyme and is thought to play a role in various cellular processes, including inflammation and the regulation of immune responses. Although the specific functions and interactions of PTGES3L are not fully elucidated, it is believed to be part of a complex network of proteins that modulate the production of prostaglandin E2, a key mediator in inflammatory pathways. Further research is needed to fully understand the clinical significance and potential therapeutic implications of PTGES3L in human health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
