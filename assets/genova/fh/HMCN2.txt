# HMCN2

## Overview
HMCN2 is a gene that encodes the protein hemicentin 2, a member of the extracellular matrix protein family. Hemicentin 2 is characterized by its large size and complex structure, which includes a von Willebrand A (vWA) domain and multiple immunoglobulin (Ig) modules, contributing to its role in maintaining tissue integrity and facilitating cell adhesion (Xu2013Specific). As part of the immunoglobulin superfamily, hemicentin 2 is involved in extracellular matrix organization and is implicated in various cellular processes, including mitotic cytokinesis and basement membrane interactions (Welcker2021Hemicentin1; Lin2020Mammalian). Despite its evolutionary conservation, the specific functions of hemicentin 2 in human physiology remain incompletely understood, with studies suggesting potential compensatory mechanisms by other proteins (Lin2020Mammalian). Mutations in the HMCN2 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, including cardiac conduction disorders and certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease (Norland2019Sequence; Belotti2022The).

## Structure
Hemicentin-2, encoded by the HMCN2 gene, is a large extracellular matrix protein characterized by a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of hemicentin-2 includes a von Willebrand A (vWA) domain and a series of immunoglobulin (Ig) modules, which together comprise over 80% of the protein's structure (Xu2013Specific). These domains are crucial for the protein's function in maintaining tissue integrity and facilitating cell adhesion (Xu2013Specific).

The secondary and tertiary structures of hemicentin-2 are defined by the stable folds formed by its Ig modules and other domains, such as the fibulin domain and multiple tandem epidermal growth factor (EGF) domains (Welcker2021Hemicentin1). The quaternary structure likely involves interactions with other extracellular matrix components, contributing to the formation of elastic extracellular matrix structures (Segade2013Molecular).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are common in extracellular matrix proteins like hemicentin-2, potentially affecting its stability and interactions (Sæterstad2024The). The presence of splice variant isoforms may contribute to the functional diversity of hemicentin-2, although specific variants are not detailed in the available context.

## Function
Hemicentin-2 (HMCN2) is a protein that plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity of tissues through its involvement in the extracellular matrix. It is characterized by a von Willebrand/Integrin A (vWA) domain and a series of immunoglobulin (Ig) modules, which contribute to its structural function (Xu2013Specific). HMCN2 is distributed on the cell surface of various cell types, including epithelial and endothelial cells, and is involved in maintaining the architectural integrity of vertebrate tissues and organs (Xu2013Specific).

HMCN2 is particularly noted for its role in mitotic cytokinesis, where it is crucial for cleavage furrow maturation, a function that distinguishes it from other members of the fibulin family (Xu2013Specific). Despite its evolutionary conservation and importance in cellular processes, the specific role of HMCN2 in healthy human cells remains not fully understood (Xu2013Specific; Sæterstad2024The). Studies in animal models suggest that HMCN2 may not have a critical standalone function, as knockout models do not exhibit significant phenotypic changes, indicating potential compensatory mechanisms by other proteins (Welcker2021Hemicentin1; Lin2020Mammalian).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the HMCN2 gene have been implicated in various cardiac and vascular conditions. A genome-wide association study identified a loss-of-function variant in HMCN2 that significantly associates with the QRS peak-to-peak amplitude, a critical parameter in cardiac electrophysiology. The stop-gain variant p.Ser699Ter in HMCN2 is associated with a high risk of left posterior fascicular block, a type of ventricular conduction disorder, suggesting a link between HMCN2 mutations and specific cardiac conduction disorders (Norland2019Sequence).

In the context of bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) and associated aortic dilation (AAD), an association signal at rs13294886 in HMCN2 suggests its involvement in calcium metabolism and valve degeneration due to calcium deposits. This makes HMCN2 a candidate for further research on genetic susceptibility to BAV, although the study faced limitations such as a small sample size and lack of significant findings across different cohorts (GagoDíaz2017The).

HMCN2 has also been associated with high-grade serous ovarian cancer, where its downregulation is linked to the inhibition of cell invasion, indicating a potential role in cancer progression (Belotti2022The). Additionally, novel mutations in HMCN2 have been identified in patients with metastatic oral squamous cell carcinoma, with a mutation frequency of 32% (Lin2023Identification).

## Interactions
Hemicentin 2 (HMCN2) is involved in extracellular matrix organization and is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. While specific interactions of HMCN2 with other proteins are not extensively detailed, it is suggested that HMCN2 may interact with other matrix proteins to facilitate basement membrane (BM) connections. This potential interaction is highlighted in studies involving zebrafish, where HMCN2 is implicated in linking BMs during fin development, possibly interacting with fibulin-1, a known matrix protein (Lin2020Mammalian).

In mammals, HMCN2 is thought to play a role in BM organization, particularly in the BM-enclosure of the satellite cell niche, suggesting a function in BM integrity and organization (Welcker2021Hemicentin1). Despite these suggestions, specific protein interactions involving HMCN2 remain unclear due to the lack of detailed studies and specific antibodies to confirm its presence and interactions in tissues (Lin2020Mammalian).

Overall, while HMCN2 is recognized for its role in extracellular matrix functions, the precise nature of its interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids requires further investigation to be fully elucidated.
