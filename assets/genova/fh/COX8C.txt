# COX8C

## Overview
COX8C is a gene that encodes the protein cytochrome c oxidase subunit 8C, a component of cytochrome c oxidase, also known as Complex IV, which is the terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This protein is integral to cellular respiration, facilitating the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to oxygen, thereby contributing to the proton gradient essential for ATP synthesis. As a subunit of cytochrome c oxidase, COX8C plays a pivotal role in mitochondrial energy metabolism and is involved in the formation and stability of supercomplexes, which are crucial for the structural integrity and function of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (van2018Does; Lin2017EstrogenERα; de2023Mutations).

## Function
COX8C encodes a subunit of cytochrome c oxidase (Complex IV), which is the terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This enzyme plays a critical role in cellular respiration by facilitating the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to oxygen, a process that contributes to the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This proton gradient is essential for ATP synthesis, the primary energy currency of the cell (Lin2017EstrogenERα; de2023Mutations).

COX8C is involved in the formation and stability of supercomplexes, which are assemblies of multiple oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes. These supercomplexes are crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and function of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (van2018Does). The presence of COX8C as a subunit in cytochrome c oxidase indicates its role in mitochondrial energy metabolism, particularly in processes that require efficient electron transfer and ATP production (Lin2017EstrogenERα).

In healthy human cells, COX8C is active in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it contributes to the overall bioenergetic capacity of the cell, supporting various cellular functions and organismal outcomes related to energy production and metabolic regulation (de2023Mutations).
