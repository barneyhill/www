# UQCC1

## Overview
UQCC1, also known as ubiquinol-cstone c reduct, is a crucial protein involved in the assembly of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III, also known as the cytochrome bc1 complex. This protein is encoded by the UQCC1 gene and is primarily located in the inner membrane of mitochondnya. UQCC1 plays a vital role in the translation and stabilization of the cytochrome b component of complex III, ensuring its proper integration into the complex. The protein interacts closely with UQCC2, another assembly factor, to facilitate the correct assembly and function of complex III, which is essential for effective electron transport and ATP production in cells. Deficiencies in UQCCsg can lead to significant disruptions in energy production, contributing to various clinical disorders (FernándezVizarama2015Nuclear; Tucker2013Mutations).

## Structure


## Function
The UQCC1 gene encodes a mitochondrial protein that plays a crucial role in the assembly and function of complex III in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. UQCC1 is essential for the translation and stabilization of newly synthesized cytochrome b, a key component of complex III, ensuring its proper delivery to an early complex III assembly intermediate (Tucker2013Mutations). In healthy human cells, UQCC1 localizes to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it interacts with UQCC2 to facilitate the expression and stabilization of cytochrome b. This interaction is vital for maintaining the stability and function of complex III, as knockdown of UQCC1 leads to a reduction in complex III subunits and overall levels (Tucker2013Mutations).

UQCC1 is specifically associated with newly synthesized cytochrome b, and its absence results in a marked reduction of cytochrome b protein levels, although MT-CYB mRNA levels remain unaffected. This suggests that UQCC1 is involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of cytochrome b (Tucker2013Mutations). The protein's function is interdependent with UQCC2, highlighting their collaborative role in complex III biogenesis and mitochondrial function (Tucker2013Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the UQCC1 gene can lead to mitochondrial complex III deficiency, a condition that affects the mitochondrial respiratory chain and impairs cellular energy production. This deficiency is associated with a range of clinical manifestations, including developmental delays, metabolic acidosis, and neurological symptoms such as autistic features (Tucker2013Mutations). UQCC1 is crucial for the assembly and function of complex III, and its deficiency results in reduced levels of complex III subunits, impacting mitochondrial function (Tucker2013Mutations). 

While specific diseases directly caused by UQCC1 mutations are not extensively documented, the gene's role in complex III assembly suggests that its dysfunction could contribute to mitochondrial disorders characterized by energy production deficits (FernándezVizarra2015Nuclear). Additionally, variations at the UQCC1 locus have been associated with human height, indicating potential broader implications of its genetic variations (Tucker2013Mutations).

In the context of skeletal diseases, UQCC1 has been studied for its role in bone formation and skeletal morphogenesis. However, no significant association was found between UQCC1 polymorphisms and developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) in a Turkish population, suggesting that its impact on skeletal conditions may be limited or context-dependent (Gumus2020The).

## Interactions
UQCC1, also known as ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex assembly factor 1, is a mitochondrial protein that plays a critical role in the assembly of complex III of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. UQCC1 is localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane and interacts with UQCC2, another assembly factor essential for complex III biogenesis. This interaction is crucial for the stability and function of complex III, as UQCC1 deficiency leads to a loss of UQCC2 and a reduction in complex III subunits, including UQCRFS1, UQCRC1, and UQCRC2 (Tucker2013Mutations). UQCC1 specifically associates with newly synthesized cytochrome b, a key subunit of complex III, indicating its role in the early stages of complex III assembly (Tucker2013Mutations).

The interaction between UQCC1 and UQCC2 is direct, as demonstrated by co-purification studies, and is necessary for the expression of cytochrome b. This interaction is similar to the regulatory mechanism observed in yeast, where Cbp3p and Cbp6p proteins regulate cytochrome b expression in response to complex III assembly (Tucker2013Mutations). UQCC1's role in complex III assembly is further supported by its co-expression with UQCC2 and complex III subunit genes, suggesting a coordinated function in mitochondrial biogenesis (Tucker2013Mutations).
