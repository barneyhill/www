# JAK3

## Overview
JAK3 is a gene that encodes the protein Janus kinase 3, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a pivotal role in the signaling pathways of various cytokines, particularly within hematopoietic cells. The JAK3 protein is integral to the function of the common gamma chain (γc) receptor subunit, which is shared by several interleukins, including IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21. These interleukins are crucial for immune cell development and function, highlighting the importance of JAK3 in immune system regulation (Suzuki2000Janus; Yamaoka2004The). Structurally, JAK3 comprises several domains, including a kinase domain, a pseudokinase domain, an SH2-like domain, and a FERM domain, each contributing to its regulatory and catalytic activities (Babon2014The; Yamaoka2004The). Mutations in the JAK3 gene are linked to various immunological disorders and malignancies, underscoring its clinical significance in both inherited and acquired conditions (Liongue2024Janus; Luo2021JAKSTAT).

## Structure
JAK3 is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a crucial role in cytokine receptor signaling. The protein is composed of several domains, including a kinase domain, a pseudokinase domain, an SH2-like domain, and a FERM domain. The kinase domain, located at the carboxyl terminus, is a typical eukaryotic tyrosine kinase domain responsible for its catalytic activity (Yamaoka2004The). Adjacent to the kinase domain is the pseudokinase domain, which, despite being catalytically inactive, plays a significant regulatory role in the protein's function (Babon2014The; Yamaoka2004The).

The FERM domain, located at the amino terminus, mediates interactions with transmembrane proteins such as cytokine receptors, and is crucial for binding and regulating the kinase domain's activity (Yamaoka2004The). JAK3 undergoes autophosphorylation, which is essential for its activation, although the precise function of these modifications is not fully understood (Yamaoka2004The). The protein is large, consisting of over 1,100 amino acids, with a molecular mass of 120-140 kDa (Yamaoka2004The).

JAK3 is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells and is crucial for signaling through the common γ chain (γc) receptor subunit, which includes cytokines like IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21 (Yamaoka2004The). The gene is located on chromosome 19p13.1 in humans (Yamaoka2004The). Although alternatively spliced forms of JAK3 have been described, their functional significance is not well understood (Yamaoka2004The).

## Function
Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that plays a critical role in cytokine signaling, particularly in hematopoietic cells. It is associated with the common gamma chain (γc) receptor subunit, which is shared by several interleukins, including IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21. This association is essential for the signaling pathways of these cytokines, which are crucial for immune cell development and function (Suzuki2000Janus; Yamaoka2004The). JAK3 is involved in the activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, where it phosphorylates STAT proteins, leading to their dimerization and translocation to the nucleus to regulate gene expression (Yamaoka2004The).

In the context of epithelial cells, JAK3 interacts with β-catenin to regulate adherens junctions (AJs) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). It phosphorylates β-catenin at specific tyrosine residues, which is crucial for maintaining epithelial barrier functions and preventing EMT. This phosphorylation enhances transepithelial electrical resistance, indicating improved barrier function (Mishra2017Janus). JAK3's role in maintaining mucosal homeostasis and intestinal differentiation is also significant, as it is involved in cytoskeletal remodeling and epithelial wound repair (Mishra2013Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the JAK3 gene are associated with several immunological disorders and malignancies. Homozygous loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in JAK3 lead to severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), characterized by a near absence of T and natural killer (NK) cells, while B cell numbers are preserved but functionally impaired. This condition results in recurrent infections and is often fatal in infancy unless treated with allogeneic stem cell transplantation (Luo2021JAKSTAT; Candotti1997Structural; Roberts2004Janus).

Germline heterozygous gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in JAK3 cause familial chronic lymphoproliferative disorder of NK cells (CLPD-NK), which is marked by autoimmunity, hypogammaglobulinemia, and lymphoproliferation with NK cell expansion (Liongue2024Janus; Luo2021JAKSTAT). Somatic JAK3 GOF mutations are implicated in various T cell malignancies, including T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) (Liongue2024Janus).

JAK3 mutations are also found in other hematopoietic cancers, such as acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), as well as in solid tumors like lung cancer and high-grade serous ovarian cancer (Liongue2024Janus). These mutations can be a mix of GOF, LOF, and benign, highlighting the diverse impact of JAK3 alterations on disease (Liongue2024Janus).

## Interactions
JAK3 interacts with the common gamma chain (γc) of cytokine receptors, which is crucial for interleukin-2 (IL-2) mediated signaling. The N-terminal JH7-6 domains of JAK3 are necessary and sufficient for binding to γc, facilitating the transmission of IL-2 signals. This interaction is confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation and competition assays, indicating that these domains are essential for the association with γc (Chen1997The).

JAK3 also forms complexes with other proteins in granulosa cells, such as leptin receptor overlapping transcript-like 1 (LEPROTL1), inhibin beta A (INHBA), and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (CDKN1B). These interactions were identified through yeast two-hybrid screening and confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation assays. These interactions suggest a role for JAK3 in follicular development and granulosa cell proliferation (Ndiaye2016Differential).

The pseudokinase domain (JH2) of JAK3 interacts with its kinase domain (JH1), exerting an autoinhibitory effect. This interaction is crucial for regulating JAK3's catalytic activity and is demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation assays (Chen2000Complex).
