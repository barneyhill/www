# PURB

## Overview
The PURB gene encodes the purine-rich element binding protein B (Purβ), a transcriptional regulator involved in various cellular processes. Purβ is a nucleic acid-binding protein that specifically interacts with purine-rich single-stranded DNA and RNA sequences, playing a critical role in gene expression regulation. Structurally, Purβ is characterized by three PUR repeats that form a PUR domain, essential for its binding activity and dimerization, which is crucial for its function as a transcriptional repressor (Rumora2013Structural; Rumora2016Electrostatic). The protein is involved in the repression of genes such as ACTA2, which is important for controlling myofibroblast differentiation and preventing fibrosis (Ferris2018Structural). Additionally, Purβ is implicated in Schwann cell myelination and interacts with various transcription factors and co-repressors, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular regulation (Rumora2016Electrostatic; Belin2019YAP). Alterations in the PURB gene have been associated with diseases such as acute myelogenous leukemia, underscoring its clinical significance (Kelm2017Characterization).

## Structure
Purine-rich element binding protein B (Purβ) is characterized by its ability to bind purine-rich single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and RNA, playing a crucial role in transcriptional regulation. The protein contains three regions of internal homology known as PUR repeats I, II, and III, which form a PUR domain essential for its binding activity (Rumora2013Structural; Rumora2016Electrostatic). These repeats are structured with four β-strands and one α-helix, contributing to the protein's secondary structure (Rumora2013Structural).

The tertiary structure of Purβ involves a hydrophobic core that facilitates protein folding and dimerization, with hydrophobic residues located in the interior of both intramolecular and intermolecular subdomains (Rumora2016Electrostatic). The intermolecular association of PUR repeat III sequences is particularly important for dimerization and high-affinity ssDNA binding (Rumora2016Electrostatic; Rumora2013Structural).

Purβ forms a homodimer in its quaternary structure, with the PUR III repeat acting as the dimerization domain (Rumora2013Structural). This dimerization is crucial for its function as a transcriptional repressor, as it allows the protein to form stable nucleoprotein complexes on target DNA elements (Rumora2013Structural). The protein's structure is further stabilized by electrostatic interactions, with charged amino acids playing a key role in nucleic acid binding (Rumora2016Electrostatic).

## Function
The PURB gene encodes the purine-rich element-binding protein B (Purβ), which plays a significant role in regulating gene expression in healthy human cells. Purβ is primarily involved in the repression of the ACTA2 gene, which encodes smooth muscle α-actin, a key marker of myofibroblast differentiation. This repression is crucial for maintaining the balance of myofibroblast differentiation and preventing excessive tissue contraction and fibrosis (Rumora2013Structural; Ferris2018Structural). Purβ achieves this by binding to purine-rich single-stranded DNA sequences in the ACTA2 promoter, forming high-affinity complexes that block the recognition of trans-activator binding sites (Rumora2013Structural).

Purβ is also involved in Schwann cell myelination, where its expression is regulated by the YAP/TAZ/TEAD transcription factors. Silencing Purβ in Schwann cells impairs their ability to myelinate axons, indicating its role in the myelination process (Belin2019YAP). Structurally, Purβ contains three PUR repeats, with the PUR III repeat being crucial for dimerization and full repressor function (Rumora2013Structural). This structural arrangement allows Purβ to form stable nucleoprotein complexes, essential for its function in gene repression (Rumora2013Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PURB gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and hematologic disorders. In acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), increased expression of the Purβ protein, encoded by the PURB gene, is associated with disrupted myeloid cell homeostasis. This elevated expression serves as a biomarker for myeloid neoplastic transformation, especially in high-risk AML patients, and is linked to poor prognosis, particularly in those with FLT3 mutations (Kelm2017Characterization). 

The study by Ferris and Kelm highlights that single-nucleotide polymorphic variants in the PURB gene, such as R297Q and P223L, affect protein-protein interactions rather than DNA binding. These changes can influence the repressor activity of Purβ, potentially contributing to disease susceptibility. Although the clinical significance of these variants is not fully established, they may play a role in disease through altered protein interactions (Ferris2018Structural).

Additionally, mutations in the related PURA gene have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, and hemizygous deletion of PURA or PURB is associated with myelodysplastic syndrome progressing to acute myelogenous leukemia, suggesting a potential link between PURB mutations and disease (Ferris2018Structural).

## Interactions
Purine-rich element binding protein B (PURB) is involved in various interactions with both nucleic acids and proteins, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation. PURB binds specifically to purine-rich single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) sequences, such as those found in the promoter region of the ACTA2 gene, forming high-affinity nucleoprotein complexes. This binding is facilitated by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, which are crucial for the stable formation of these complexes (Rumora2016Electrostatic; Rumora2013Structural).

PURB also interacts with several transcription factors and co-repressors. It forms complexes with the Y-box binding protein (YB-1), which is essential for its function as a transcriptional repressor (Rumora2016Electrostatic). Additionally, PURB interacts with the co-repressor MSY1, with specific mutations in PURB affecting the binding affinity to MSY1 (Rumora2016Electrostatic; Ferris2018Structural). The protein's interaction with other transcription factors, such as TEF1 and Smad3, is also noted, influencing the regulation of the ACTA2 gene (Ferris2018Structural).

The structural domains of PURB, particularly the PUR III repeat, are important for its ability to self-associate and interact with other proteins, contributing to its role in gene repression (Rumora2013Structural; Ferris2018Structural).
