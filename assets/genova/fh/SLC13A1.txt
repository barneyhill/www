# SLC13A1

## Overview
The SLC13A1 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 13 member 1, also known as the sodium-sulfate cotransporter NaS1. This protein is a transmembrane transporter primarily expressed in the intestines and kidneys, where it plays a critical role in the reabsorption of sulfate ions. Sulfate ions are essential for various physiological processes, including the sulfation of neurotransmitters, hormones, and other molecules, which are crucial for cellular metabolism and detoxification (Tise2017Sexspecific). The proper function of SLC13A1 is vital for maintaining sulfate homeostasis in the body, and disruptions in this gene can lead to clinical conditions such as hyposulfatemia and related metabolic disorders (Langford2017Genetics).

## Function
The SLC13A1 gene encodes the sodium-sulfate cotransporter NaS1, which is primarily expressed in the intestines and kidneys. This protein plays a crucial role in the reabsorption of sulfate ions, which are vital for maintaining serum sulfate levels in the body (Tise2017Sexspecific). Sulfate is essential for various biochemical processes, including the biotransformation of neurotransmitters, proteoglycans, xenobiotics, and hormones such as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) through sulfation reactions (Tise2017Sexspecific). These reactions are often rate-limited by the availability of endogenous sulfate, highlighting the importance of SLC13A1 in cellular metabolism and detoxification processes.

In healthy human cells, the proper function of SLC13A1 ensures the maintenance of sulfate homeostasis, which is critical for normal physiological functions. The gene's activity in the intestines and kidneys facilitates the absorption and reabsorption of sulfate, preventing conditions like hyposulfatemia, which can occur due to loss-of-function alleles in SLC13A1 (Tise2017Sexspecific). The regulation of sulfate levels by SLC13A1 also impacts hormone physiology, particularly influencing DHEA homeostasis, with potential sex-specific effects observed in certain populations (Tise2017Sexspecific).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC13A1 gene, which encodes a sodium-dependent sulfate transporter, have been linked to several clinical conditions. Disruption of this gene can lead to renal sulfate wasting and hyposulfatemia, characterized by low serum sulfate levels. This condition affects the sulfonation capacity in cells, impacting tissues with high sulfate requirements such as chondrocytes, endothelial cells, and hepatocytes. Consequently, individuals with SLC13A1 mutations may exhibit skeletal, vascular, and hepatic metabolism abnormalities (Langford2017Genetics).

In Miniature Poodles, a partial deletion of the SLC13A1 gene is associated with osteochondrodysplasia, a disorder marked by stunted growth and abnormal bone development. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and results in hyposulfatemia and potentially hypersulfaturia (Neff2012Partial).

Rare loss-of-function variants in SLC13A1, such as p.Arg12Ter and p.Trp48Ter, have been associated with intervertebral disc disorder (IDD) and dorsalgia. These variants are linked to reduced serum sulfate levels and may contribute to decreased intervertebral disc height, affecting spinal length and potentially leading to pain (Bjornsdottir2022Rare). The study suggests that sulfate supplementation could be beneficial for individuals with reduced sulfate levels (Bjornsdottir2022Rare).
