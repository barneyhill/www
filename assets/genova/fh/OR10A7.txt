# OR10A7

## Overview
The OR10A7 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 10 subfamily A member 7, which is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as an olfactory receptor, playing a crucial role in the detection of odorant molecules and the initiation of olfactory signal transduction. Olfactory receptors, including OR10A7, are characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is typical of many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors. The OR10A7 gene is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it contributes to the diversity of odorant recognition and the perception of smell. As a member of the largest gene family in the human genome, OR10A7 is involved in the complex process of olfaction, which is essential for various behaviors and environmental interactions (Qiu2020aarFDC).
