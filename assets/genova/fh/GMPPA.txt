# GMPPA

## Overview
GMPPA is a gene that encodes the enzyme GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase A, which plays a crucial role in glycosylation pathways. These pathways are essential for the attachment of glycans to proteins, a process vital for protein folding, stability, and function. The GMPPA protein is categorized as a pyrophosphorylase and is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the biosynthesis of GDP-mannose, a key substrate in glycosylation processes (Gold2017A). Although the precise functions of GMPPA are not fully elucidated, it is implicated in maintaining normal GDP-mannose levels, which are critical for the proper glycosylation of membrane and secretory glycoproteins. Mutations in GMPPA have been linked to Alacrima, Achalasia, and Mental Retardation Syndrome (AAMR), a congenital disorder of glycosylation, and have also been associated with decreased survival in lung adenocarcinoma, highlighting its significance in both developmental and pathological contexts (Cho2018Association; Diaz2020Evidence; Gold2017A).

## Structure


## Function
GMPPA encodes the GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase A protein, which is involved in glycosylation pathways, a critical cellular process where glycans are attached to proteins. This process is essential for proper protein folding, stability, and function. Although the specific function of GMPPA is not well defined, it is implicated in maintaining normal levels of GDP-mannose, a crucial substrate for glycosylation pathways, including O-mannosylation of membrane and secretory glycoproteins (Gold2017A). 

Mutations in GMPPA have been associated with a disorder characterized by achalasia, alacrima, neurological deficits, and intellectual disability, suggesting its role in these pathways. A study identified a novel homozygous splice site variant in GMPPA in two affected siblings, leading to a complete loss of GMPPA protein and increased levels of GDP-mannose, indicating a disruption in glycosylation processes. This suggests that GMPPA may play a role in maintaining normal levels of GDP-mannose and proper glycosylation in healthy human cells (Gold2017A). 

GMPPA is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the biosynthesis of GDP-mannose, impacting various cellular functions and organismal outcomes, including proper immune response and development (Gold2017A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GMPPA gene are associated with Alacrima, Achalasia, and Mental Retardation Syndrome (AAMR), a congenital disorder of glycosylation. This condition is characterized by a triad of symptoms: alacrima (lack of tears), achalasia (esophageal motility disorder), and intellectual disability. Patients may also exhibit additional symptoms such as hypohydrosis, seizures, microcephaly, esotropia, and craniofacial dysmorphism (Diaz2020Evidence; Gold2017A). AAMR shares phenotypic overlap with Triple-A syndrome, but is distinct due to the absence of adrenal insufficiency and AAAS mutations (Diaz2020Evidence).

A specific homozygous splice site variant, c.853+1G>A, has been identified in affected individuals from a consanguineous Lebanese family, leading to a complete loss of GMPPA protein and increased levels of GDP-mannose in lymphoblasts (Gold2017A). Another mutation, c.265dup, p.L89fs, has been reported in patients from an indigenous Guatemalan population, suggesting it may be a founder mutation in this group (Diaz2020Evidence).

In addition to its role in AAMR, mutations in GMPPA have been associated with decreased survival in lung adenocarcinoma, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker in this cancer type (Cho2018Association).
