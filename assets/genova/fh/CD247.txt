# CD247

## Overview
The CD247 gene encodes the CD247 protein, also known as the T-cell receptor zeta chain, which is a crucial component of the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex. This transmembrane protein plays a significant role in the immune system by facilitating T-cell activation and signal transduction. The CD247 protein is characterized by its long intracellular domain containing three immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs), which are essential for transmitting activation signals within T-cells and natural killer (NK) cells (Ye2019CD247; Al‐Akioui‐Sanz2021A). The gene is expressed in various immune cells and is involved in the assembly and surface expression of the TCR/CD3 complex, which is vital for T-cell development and function (Li2021CD247). Alterations in the CD247 gene have been linked to autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular conditions, and cancer, underscoring its clinical significance (Li2024Polymorphisms; Pateriya2024Decreased; Li2011Association).

## Structure
The CD247 protein, also known as the CD3 zeta chain, is a critical component of the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex. Its primary structure consists of a polypeptide chain that includes three immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs), which are essential for signal transduction (Al‐Akioui‐Sanz2021A). The secondary structure of CD247 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its functional conformation. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a domain that facilitates interaction with other proteins in the TCR complex. In terms of quaternary structure, CD247 forms disulfide-bonded homodimers within the TCR/CD3 complex, associating with other CD3 subunits to form a functional receptor complex (Al‐Akioui‐Sanz2021A).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are critical for the function of CD247, as they play a significant role in the activation and signal transduction processes of T-cells. These modifications occur primarily on the ITAMs, enabling the propagation of activation signals following antigen recognition. The CD247 gene also exhibits splice variants, which may result in different isoforms with distinct functional roles, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context (Al‐Akioui‐Sanz2021A).

## Function
The CD247 gene, also known as the T-cell receptor zeta chain, is a critical component of the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex, playing a vital role in T-cell activation and signal transduction. In healthy human cells, CD247 is essential for the recognition and activation of antigenic peptides presented by human leukocyte antigens on antigen-presenting cells or tumor cells. It is involved in the assembly and surface expression of the TCR/CD3 complex on T lymphocytes, which is crucial for T-cell development and function (Ye2019CD247; Al‐Akioui‐Sanz2021A).

CD247 is unique among TCR subunits due to its structure, featuring a long intracellular domain with three immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs), which are critical for signal transduction. This gene is not only present in T-lymphocytes but also in natural killer (NK) cells, where it forms complexes with activating receptors like NKp46, NKp30, and CD16, facilitating signal transduction and effector functions (Al‐Akioui‐Sanz2021A).

The proper functioning of CD247 is indispensable for T-cell responsiveness and proliferative capacity, affecting immune surveillance and the body's ability to respond to pathogens (Ye2019CD247). In NK cells, CD247 is involved in NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, contributing to the regulation of immune responses (Li2021CD247).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CD247 gene are associated with several autoimmune diseases and conditions. In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), CD247 variants have been linked to disease susceptibility, particularly in Asian populations. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CD247 are associated with sub-phenotypes of SLE, such as oral ulcers and hematologic disorders (Li2011Association). The gene is also implicated in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) and Autoimmune Thyroid Disease (AITD), with several SNPs in CD247 showing significant associations with these conditions in a northern Swedish population (Holmberg2016Association).

In the context of cardiovascular diseases, CD247 polymorphisms have been associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in the Chinese Han population. The SNP rs858543, in particular, is linked to increased susceptibility to DCM, while the TT genotype of this SNP is associated with longer survival in DCM patients (Li2024Polymorphisms).

In cancer, decreased expression of CD247 is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer subtypes. Lower CD247 expression correlates with reduced overall survival and relapse-free survival, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker (Pateriya2024Decreased).

## Interactions
CD247, also known as the T-cell receptor zeta chain, is a critical component of the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex and participates in various protein interactions essential for T-cell activation and signal transduction. It interacts with several proteins, including LCK, ZAP-70, and FYN, which are involved in T-cell activation and immune response regulation (Li2021CD247; Deng2022Identification). CD247 is part of the TCR-CD3 complex, where it plays a role in coupling the TCR to intracellular signaling pathways, such as the phosphoinositide and tyrosine kinase pathways (Irving1991The).

CD247 also interacts with the SHC1 protein, an adaptor protein that binds to the phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) of CD247. This interaction is enhanced by phosphorylation, which strengthens the binding through electrostatic interactions (Liu2009CD247). Molecular dynamics simulations and experimental studies have shown that CD247 can bind to SHC1 in both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated states, although the binding is stronger when CD247 is phosphorylated (Liu2009CD247). These interactions underscore the importance of CD247 in T-cell receptor signaling and immune response modulation.
