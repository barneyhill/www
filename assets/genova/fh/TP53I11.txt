# TP53I11

## Overview
TP53I11 is a gene that encodes the tumor protein p53 inducible protein 11, which is a crucial component in cellular processes related to metabolism and stress response. This protein is primarily involved in regulating cell proliferation and survival by modulating metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, to maintain cellular energy balance (Xiao2018TP53I11). TP53I11 is also significant in the suppression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), thereby playing a role in maintaining tissue integrity and preventing unwanted cell migration (Xiao2018TP53I11). Furthermore, TP53I11 interacts with various proteins, including tumor protein p53, and is involved in transcriptional regulation through pathways like the HDAC1/p-SMAD3-TP53I11 axis, which is important in cancer progression and subtype transitions, particularly in glioblastoma (Zhao2024Unveiling). These interactions and functions underscore the gene's potential as a prognostic marker in clinical settings, especially in the context of glioblastoma (Zhao2024Unveiling).

## Structure


## Function
TP53I11, also known as tumor protein p53 inducible protein 11, is involved in several key cellular processes, particularly in response to metabolic stress. In healthy human cells, TP53I11 plays a significant role in regulating cell proliferation and survival. Under normal culture conditions, it promotes cell proliferation by enhancing glycolysis, which is crucial for providing energy and biosynthetic precursors necessary for cell growth (Xiao2018TP53I11). TP53I11 also influences cellular metabolism by increasing glycolytic capacity, thereby supporting cell proliferation (Xiao2018TP53I11).

The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm and contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis. It is involved in the regulation of oxidative phosphorylation, where its loss decreases the basal oxygen consumption rate but increases maximal respiration and spare capacity, indicating a shift towards oxidative phosphorylation when glycolysis is inhibited (Xiao2018TP53I11). This suggests that TP53I11 is crucial for balancing energy metabolism in cells.

Additionally, TP53I11 is implicated in the suppression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process important for cell migration and invasion, by maintaining epithelial characteristics and inhibiting mesenchymal traits (Xiao2018TP53I11). This function is vital for preventing unwanted cell migration and maintaining tissue integrity.

## Clinical Significance
TP53I11, also known as tumor protein p53 inducible protein 11, plays a significant role in the clinical context of glioblastoma (GBM), particularly in the transition between glioblastoma subtypes. Alterations in TP53I11 expression are associated with the conversion of glioblastoma from the mesenchymal (MES) subtype to the proneural (PN) subtype. This conversion is driven by the HDAC1/p-SMAD3-TP53I11 axis, where TP53I11 acts as a downstream regulated gene. Higher expression levels of TP53I11 in GBM tumor tissues correlate with longer patient survival times, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker. TP53I11 expression is notably higher in the PN subtype compared to the MES subtype, and it is effective in distinguishing PN patients from other subtypes. The gene maintains the characteristics of the PN subtype and inhibits the proliferation and invasion of MES GBM both in vivo and in vitro. Interfering with TP53I11 expression in PN subtype GBM cell lines leads to increased cell proliferation and invasion, suggesting its role in tumor suppression. These findings highlight the importance of TP53I11 in glioblastoma subtype transitions and its potential impact on patient prognosis (Zhao2024Unveiling).

## Interactions
TP53I11, also known as tumor protein p53 inducible protein 11, is involved in several interactions with other proteins that influence cellular processes. It interacts with the tumor protein p53, playing a role in apoptosis regulation as a downstream target of p53 (Luo2017Ehrlichia). TP53I11 is also part of the HDAC1/p-SMAD3-TP53I11 axis, which is significant in the conversion of glioblastoma from the mesenchymal (MES) to the proneural (PN) subtype. This axis involves the interaction of TP53I11 with p-SMAD3, a component of the TGF-β signaling pathway, and is crucial for transcriptional regulation through histone acetylation (Zhao2024Unveiling). The HDAC1 inhibitor RG2833 enhances the binding of p-SMAD3 to the genome, promoting TP53I11 expression (Zhao2024Unveiling). Additionally, TP53I11 interacts with the expanded form of ATXN1, as identified in studies examining protein binding differences between wild-type and expanded ATXN1 (Rocha2019ATXN1). These interactions highlight TP53I11's role in apoptosis, transcriptional regulation, and potentially in the modulation of protein complexes involved in cancer progression.
