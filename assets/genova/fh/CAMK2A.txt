# CAMK2A

## Overview
CAMK2A is a gene that encodes the alpha subunit of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKIIα), a serine/threonine kinase that is integral to calcium signaling pathways, particularly within the central nervous system. The protein product, CaMKIIα, is predominantly expressed in the brain, where it plays a crucial role in synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. This kinase is activated by the binding of calcium-bound calmodulin, which triggers autophosphorylation and allows the enzyme to remain active even after calcium levels subside. This persistent activation is essential for maintaining synaptic changes associated with memory formation. CaMKIIα is involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release and synaptic development, influencing axonal and dendritic growth, and interacts with various proteins in the postsynaptic density to modulate synaptic signaling and plasticity (Mohanan2022Role; Lisman2012Mechanisms). The gene's significance is underscored by its association with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder, when mutated (Fujii2022Förster).

## Structure
CAMK2A, a serine/threonine kinase, is a crucial component in calcium signaling, particularly in neurons. The primary structure of CAMK2A includes an N-terminal catalytic kinase domain, a Ca2+-calmodulin-binding regulatory domain, and a C-terminal association domain necessary for the assembly of the holoenzyme (Chia2018A). The secondary structure features alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its compact kinase domain in the tertiary structure (Chia2018A).

The quaternary structure of CAMK2A forms a dodecameric holoenzyme, typically organized into two stacked hexameric rings (Stratton2013Structural). This oligomeric assembly is essential for its function, as it allows for the cooperative binding of Ca2+/calmodulin and subsequent activation (Stratton2013Structural). The association domain plays a critical role in oligomerization, with mutations in this region potentially disrupting holoenzyme assembly (Chia2018A).

CAMK2A undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation at Thr 286, which is crucial for its activation and function in synaptic plasticity (Bhattacharyya2019Structural). Alternative splicing of CAMK2A results in various isoforms, contributing to its functional diversity in different tissues (Sloutsky2020Functional).

## Function
The CAMK2A gene encodes the alpha subunit of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKIIα), a serine/threonine kinase that plays a pivotal role in synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. In healthy human cells, CaMKIIα is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in the hippocampus and neocortex, where it is crucial for long-term potentiation (LTP), a process essential for synaptic strengthening and memory formation (Mohanan2022Role; Chia2018A).

CaMKIIα is activated by calcium-bound calmodulin, leading to autophosphorylation at threonine 286, which allows the enzyme to remain active even after calcium levels decrease. This persistent activation is vital for maintaining synaptic changes associated with memory (Mohanan2022Role; Lisman2012Mechanisms). The enzyme is involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release and synaptic development, influencing axonal and dendritic growth, which is critical for synaptic strength and memory consolidation (Mohanan2022Role).

CaMKIIα also interacts with various proteins in the postsynaptic density, such as NMDA receptors, to modulate synaptic signaling and plasticity. Its activity is essential for the phosphorylation of substrates that regulate AMPA receptor trafficking and synaptic strength, contributing to the structural and functional plasticity of synapses (Mohanan2022Role; Lisman2002The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CAMK2A gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). De novo missense mutations such as p.Pro212Leu (P212L) have been identified in patients with ID and ASD, and are considered pathogenic due to their impact on the biochemical properties of CaMKIIα, the protein encoded by CAMK2A (Fujii2022Förster). These mutations often lead to aberrant facilitation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent activation of CaMKIIα, which is crucial for synaptic plasticity and learning (Fujii2022Förster).

Other mutations, such as p.H477Y, result in severe intellectual disability, growth delay, and frequent seizures. This mutation disrupts CAMK2A self-oligomerization and holoenzyme assembly, essential for synaptic function (Chia2018A). The E183V mutation is linked to ASD-related behaviors and affects dendritic morphology and synaptic transmission, leading to decreased dendritic spine density and impaired synaptic targeting (Stephenson2017A).

Alterations in CAMK2A expression or function can disrupt normal neuronal development and are implicated in various neuropsychiatric disorders, highlighting the gene's critical role in brain function (Küry2017De).

## Interactions
CAMK2A, also known as CaMKIIα, is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a pivotal role in synaptic plasticity and memory formation through its interactions with various proteins. It interacts with the GluN2B subunit of NMDA receptors, which is crucial for synaptic targeting and plasticity. This interaction is modulated by autophosphorylation at threonine residues, such as Thr286, which enhances its binding affinity and confers Ca2+-independent activity (Robison2005Differential; Yasuda2022CaMKII:).

CAMK2A also interacts with α-actinin and densin-180, forming a ternary complex that is essential for synaptic function (Robison2005Differential). The interaction with Shank3, a postsynaptic scaffolding protein, is critical for the phosphorylation of the nuclear CREB transcription factor and the expression of c-Fos, which are necessary for activity-dependent neuronal gene expression (Perfitt2020Neuronal).

In the context of bipolar disorder, CAMK2A is identified as a hub gene within a protein-protein interaction network, interacting with several drug targets and risk genes, suggesting its involvement in the pharmacological mechanisms of drugs used to treat the disorder (Li2019Interactome). These interactions highlight CAMK2A's role in complex signaling pathways and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.
