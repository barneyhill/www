# KRT15

## Overview
KRT15 is a gene that encodes the protein keratin 15, a type I cytokeratin involved in the structural integrity of epithelial cells. Keratin 15 is characterized by its alpha-helical rod domain, which contributes to the formation of intermediate filaments essential for maintaining the mechanical stability of epithelial tissues (Zhu2023Keratin). This protein is predominantly expressed in the basal layer of the epidermis and hair follicles, as well as in specific progenitor cells within the human breast and esophageal epithelium, where it plays a role in cell differentiation and tissue homeostasis (Giroux2017Longlived; Kohler2022Ductal; Liu2003Keratin). KRT15 is also implicated in various cellular interactions and signaling pathways, influencing processes such as cancer progression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Zhu2023Keratin; Wang2023Silencing). Alterations in KRT15 expression have clinical significance, being associated with prognostic outcomes in cancers and other diseases (Lin2020KRT; Zhong2021Low).

## Structure
Keratin 15 (KRT15) is a type I cytokeratin protein that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity of epithelial cells. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids forming an alpha-helical rod domain, which is flanked by non-helical head and tail domains. The secondary structure of KRT15 includes alpha-helices, which are characteristic of keratin proteins and contribute to their mechanical strength and resilience (Zhu2023Keratin).

The tertiary structure of KRT15 involves coiled-coil formations, which are typical of keratin proteins and facilitate the formation of stable filamentous structures within cells. In terms of quaternary structure, KRT15 typically forms heterodimers with type II keratins, such as keratin 5, to create keratin intermediate filaments. These filaments are essential for maintaining the structural integrity and mechanical stability of epithelial tissues (Giroux2017Longlived).

Post-translational modifications of KRT15 may include phosphorylation and glycosylation, which can influence its function and interactions with other proteins. These modifications are common in keratins and play a role in regulating their assembly and disassembly in response to cellular signals (Zhu2023Keratin).

## Function
Keratin 15 (KRT15) is a type I cytokeratin protein that plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity and resilience of epithelial tissues. It is primarily expressed in the basal layer of the epidermis and hair follicles, where it contributes to the formation of intermediate filaments. These filaments provide mechanical support and resilience to cells, which is crucial for skin and hair health (Liu2003Keratin).

In the human breast, KRT15 is specifically expressed in luminal progenitor cells, particularly in ductal-enriched clusters. These KRT15+ cells are associated with immature luminal progenitors and are involved in the early stages of luminal cell differentiation. This expression pattern distinguishes human breast tissue from mouse models and highlights KRT15's role in the stem cell hierarchy and tissue architecture of the breast (Kohler2022Ductal).

In the esophageal epithelium, KRT15 marks a basal cell population capable of self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation into other cell types. These KRT15+ cells are crucial for maintaining epithelial homeostasis and are involved in the regeneration of the esophageal epithelium following injury (Giroux2017Longlived).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the KRT15 gene have been associated with various cancers and other diseases. In breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA), low KRT15 expression is linked to poor prognosis, advanced clinicopathological features, and reduced overall survival. High KRT15 expression is associated with tumor-suppressive pathways and increased immune-cell infiltration, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker in BRCA (Zhong2021Low).

In esophageal carcinoma, KRT15 is highly expressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This high expression correlates with advanced tumor stages and poorer survival outcomes, indicating that KRT15 could serve as a prognostic biomarker in this cancer type (Lin2020KRT).

KRT15 also plays a role in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) induced by cigarette smoke. It appears to protect against epithelial-mesenchymal transition and airway remodeling. Knockout studies in mice have shown that the absence of KRT15 leads to aggravated lung injury and increased inflammation, suggesting its protective role in lung tissue (Zhu2023Keratin).

Additionally, a specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the KRT15 gene, rs4796672, has been associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer in women, highlighting a potential gender-specific genetic risk factor (Leberfarb2019Potential).

## Interactions
Keratin 15 (KRT15) is involved in various interactions that influence cellular processes. In liver cancer, KRT15 interacts with the β-catenin pathway, a critical signaling pathway in cancer progression. Silencing KRT15 leads to the inactivation of this pathway, resulting in decreased expression of β-catenin, cyclin D1, and c-Myc, which are key components of the pathway. This interaction affects cell viability, invasiveness, and chemosensitivity to doxorubicin in liver cancer cells (Wang2023Silencing).

In the context of cigarette smoke exposure, KRT15 modulates the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), which is involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). KRT15 knockdown leads to increased MMP-9 expression, promoting EMT, while the use of an MMP-9 inhibitor can reverse these effects. This suggests that KRT15 interacts with MMP-9 to regulate EMT progression (Zhu2023Keratin).

In breast invasive carcinoma, KRT15 expression is associated with various signaling pathways, including the TP53, FOXO, and VDR pathways, which are linked to tumor suppression. Low KRT15 expression correlates with pathways that may promote oncogene expression and tumor resistance, such as the ACE2 and ghrelin pathways (Zhong2021Low).
