# DDX31

## Overview
DDX31 is a gene that encodes the protein DEAD-box helicase 31, a member of the DEAD-box RNA helicase family. This family of proteins is characterized by the presence of the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD) and is involved in various aspects of RNA metabolism, including RNA splicing, ribosome biogenesis, and RNA decay. DEAD-box helicase 31 functions as an ATP-dependent RNA helicase, playing a crucial role in unwinding RNA structures, which is essential for maintaining RNA integrity and regulating gene expression (Xie2022Identification; Liu2021DDX31:). Predominantly active in the nucleolus, DEAD-box helicase 31 is integral to ribosomal RNA processing and assembly, thereby contributing to protein synthesis and cellular growth (Xie2022Identification). The protein's involvement in fundamental cellular processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and supporting normal cellular functions (Liu2021DDX31:). Additionally, DDX31 has been implicated in cancer-related pathways, where it interacts with key signaling molecules, highlighting its potential role in oncogenesis and cancer progression (Xie2022Identification; Ho2023Domainspecific).

## Function
DDX31, a member of the DEAD-box RNA helicase family, is involved in several critical RNA metabolic processes in healthy human cells. These processes include RNA splicing, ribosome biogenesis, and RNA decay, which are essential for maintaining RNA integrity and regulating gene expression (Xie2022Identification; Liu2021DDX31:). DDX31 functions as an ATP-dependent RNA helicase, utilizing the energy from ATP hydrolysis to unwind RNA structures, a crucial activity for the proper functioning of RNA molecules within the cell (Xie2022Identification).

DDX31 is primarily active in the nucleolus, where it plays a significant role in ribosomal RNA processing and assembly, contributing to protein synthesis and cellular growth (Xie2022Identification). DEAD-box helicases, including DDX31, are known to form large complexes with other nuclear proteins, facilitating various cellular processes in both the cytoplasm and nucleus (Xie2022Identification). While the specific functions of DDX31 in healthy human cells are not fully elucidated, its involvement in fundamental cellular processes suggests a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and supporting normal cellular functions (Liu2021DDX31:).

## Clinical Significance
DDX31 has been implicated in several cancers, notably pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), where it functions as a potential oncogene. High expression of DDX31 in PDAC is associated with poor prognosis, larger tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and higher pathological grades. It is linked to decreased overall survival and relapse-free survival in patients, suggesting its role in cancer progression and metastasis (Xie2022Identification). DDX31 promotes invasive metastasis and proliferation in PDAC by activating the MAPK signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell migration and proliferation (Xie2022Identification).

In pancreatic cancer, DDX31 overexpression enhances the migration and proliferation of cancer cells, as demonstrated by increased levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers and proliferation markers. Knockdown of DDX31 reduces these capabilities, indicating its significant role in tumor growth and metastasis (Liu2021DDX31:).

DDX31 is also involved in other cancers, such as bladder cancer, where its increased expression is linked to poorer prognosis. It interacts with mutant p53 and EGFR, influencing the EGFR-AKT signaling pathway, which is significant in cancer therapy resistance (Ho2023Domainspecific).

## Interactions
DDX31, a member of the DEAD-box RNA helicase family, is involved in various cellular interactions, particularly in cancer-related pathways. It interacts with mutant p53 proteins and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), playing a significant role in activating the EGFR-AKT signaling axis. This interaction is enhanced in the presence of transactivation domain (TAD) mutants, leading to increased levels of phosphorylated AKT, which is crucial for promoting EGFR-AKT signaling (Ho2023Domainspecific). Silencing DDX31 results in decreased levels of cytosolic phosphorylated EGFR and AKT, indicating its role in facilitating interactions with central axis protein partners (Ho2023Domainspecific).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), DDX31 is identified as a potential oncogene, promoting invasive metastasis and proliferation through the activation of the MAPK signaling pathway. It is positively correlated with core genes of the MAPK pathway, such as MAPK9, AKT1, and EGFR, and its overexpression leads to elevated levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and P38, as well as markers related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Xie2022Identification). These interactions highlight DDX31's involvement in complex signaling pathways, contributing to its role in cancer progression.
