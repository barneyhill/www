# TSEN2

## Overview
The TSEN2 gene encodes the tRNA splicing endonuclease subunit 2, a vital component of the human tRNA splicing endonuclease complex. This protein is integral to the maturation of tRNA molecules, facilitating the precise cleavage of intron-containing pre-tRNA at both 5′ and 3′ splice sites. TSEN2, along with other subunits such as TSEN34, TSEN54, and TSEN15, forms a heterotetrameric complex that is essential for the structural and functional integrity of the tRNA splicing machinery (Yuan2023Recognition; Hayne2022Recent). The protein is characterized by an α/β fold and features critical residues that enable its catalytic activity, including a 'cross-subunit cation-π sandwich' that is crucial for splice site recognition (Yuan2023Recognition; Sekulovski2022Structural). Mutations in TSEN2 are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders such as pontocerebellar hypoplasia, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular and neurological health (Bierhals2013Pontocerebellar).

## Structure
The TSEN2 protein is a critical component of the human tRNA splicing endonuclease complex, which is involved in the processing of intron-containing pre-tRNA. The primary structure of TSEN2 includes key residues such as R409, R452, and R457, which are essential for its function in recognizing and cleaving splice sites (Yuan2023Recognition). The secondary structure of TSEN2 features an α/β fold reminiscent of the Rossman fold, which is common in proteins with catalytic functions (Yuan2023Recognition).

In terms of tertiary structure, TSEN2 contains an N-terminal extension (NTE) that plays a crucial role in trapping the scissile phosphate into the catalytic pocket, which is essential for cleavage activity (Yuan2023Recognition). The quaternary structure of TSEN2 involves its assembly with other subunits of the TSEN complex, including TSEN34, TSEN54, and TSEN15. TSEN2 and TSEN34 form a catalytic core, while TSEN54 and TSEN15 serve as scaffolding subunits (Yuan2023Recognition).

The TSEN2 protein also features a 'cross-subunit cation-π sandwich' involving residues R409 and R452, which is crucial for the 3′ splice site cleavage (Sekulovski2022Structural). This structural feature highlights the evolutionary conservation of TSEN2's function across eukaryotes and archaea (Yuan2023Recognition).

## Function
The TSEN2 gene encodes a subunit of the human tRNA splicing endonuclease (TSEN) complex, which is essential for the maturation of tRNA molecules. This complex is responsible for the recognition and cleavage of intron-containing pre-tRNA, a critical step in tRNA processing. TSEN2, along with other subunits such as TSEN34, TSEN54, and TSEN15, forms a heterotetrameric structure that facilitates the cleavage of both 5′ and 3′ splice sites of pre-tRNA (Yuan2023Recognition; Hayne2022Recent).

TSEN2 plays a crucial role in the recognition of the 3′ splice-site bulge through cation-π interactions, particularly involving residues R409 and R452, which are vital for the structural integrity and function of the complex (Yuan2023Recognition). These interactions help stabilize the sharply bent backbone necessary for efficient cleavage. Mutations in TSEN2 can disrupt this process, leading to diseases such as pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH) (Yuan2023Recognition).

The TSEN complex, including TSEN2, is active in the nucleus, where it ensures the availability of mature tRNA, which is essential for protein synthesis and normal cellular function (Hayne2019Reconstitution). The proper functioning of TSEN2 is critical for maintaining cellular health and preventing neurodevelopmental disorders (Hayne2023Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TSEN2 gene are associated with several neurodegenerative disorders, most notably pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH), a condition characterized by cerebellar hypoplasia, microcephaly, and severe developmental delays. PCH is divided into subtypes, with PCH type 2 (PCH2) being the most common. Mutations in TSEN2, along with other TSEN complex genes, contribute to the pathogenesis of PCH2 by impairing the tRNA splicing endonuclease complex, crucial for pre-tRNA cleavage and maturation. This disruption can lead to progressive cerebral atrophy and early childhood death (Bierhals2013Pontocerebellar).

A specific splice site mutation, c.914-5T>A, in the TSEN2 gene has been linked to a newly identified syndrome characterized by craniofacial and central nervous system malformations, intellectual retardation, and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), which often progresses to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). This mutation affects splicing efficiency, leading to alternative splicing events and a partial loss of function of the TSEN2 protein (Canpolat2022A).

These findings underscore the critical role of TSEN2 in maintaining normal neurological and renal function, with mutations leading to significant clinical manifestations.

## Interactions
TSEN2 is a subunit of the human tRNA splicing endonuclease complex, which is composed of four subunits: TSEN54, TSEN34, TSEN15, and TSEN2. This complex is crucial for the processing of intron-containing pre-tRNA molecules. TSEN2 interacts with other subunits to form a functional complex that facilitates the recognition and cleavage of pre-tRNA at specific splice sites.

TSEN2, along with TSEN34, forms the catalytic core of the complex, with TSEN54 and TSEN15 acting as scaffolds. TSEN54 interacts extensively with TSEN34 in a 'three-claw-clamp' conformation and also with TSEN2 through their C-terminal β-strands, which is essential for the structural integrity of the complex (Yuan2023Recognition). TSEN2 is involved in a cation-π interface that stabilizes the 3′ splice site, although this interface is not essential for cleavage (Hayne2023Structural).

The TSEN2 protein also plays a role in the cleavage mechanism at the 5′ splice site, where its KRKRR motif is crucial for stabilizing the nucleotides surrounding the splice site into the catalytic pocket (Yuan2023Recognition). Specific residues in TSEN2, such as R409 and R452, form an 'arginine tweezer pair' that is crucial for 3′ splice site recognition (Yuan2023Recognition). These interactions highlight the importance of TSEN2 in maintaining the structural configuration necessary for efficient tRNA processing.
