# SEC11C

## Overview
The SEC11C gene encodes the protein SEC11 homolog C, which is a critical component of the signal peptidase complex (SPC) in eukaryotic cells, particularly in mammals. This protein functions as a catalytic subunit within the SPC, which is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is responsible for cleaving signal sequences from nascent proteins destined for secretion or ER localization. This cleavage is essential for the maturation and proper folding of these proteins, thereby playing a vital role in cellular function and homeostasis. SEC11C, along with its paralog SEC11A, forms the catalytic core of the SPC, although they do not coexist in the same complex. The protein is characterized by a serine-histidine-aspartate catalytic triad, distinguishing it from bacterial signal peptidases, and is not inhibited by typical serine protease inhibitors (Zanotti2022The).

## Structure


## Function
The SEC11C gene encodes a catalytic subunit of the signal peptidase complex (SPC) in eukaryotic cells, specifically in mammals such as humans. The SPC is a multi-subunit complex located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that cleaves signal sequences from ER-targeted and secretory proteins, facilitating their maturation and proper folding. This process is essential for protein targeting and secretion, impacting cellular function and organismal homeostasis (Zanotti2022The).

SEC11C, along with SEC11A, forms the catalytic core of the SPC, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity. The catalytic site of SEC11C is constituted by a serine-histidine-aspartate triad, which is distinct from the serine-lysine dyad found in bacterial type I signal peptidases. SEC11C is not inhibited by common serine protease inhibitors, similar to its bacterial counterparts (Zanotti2022The).

In humans, SEC11C and SEC11A do not coexist in the same complex but form two separate paralogous complexes, each including the accessory subunits SPCS1, SPCS2, and SPCS3. The SPC's structure, as revealed by cryo-electron microscopy, suggests a 'molecular ruler' function that accommodates signal sequences but not transmembrane domains, contributing to its specificity (Zanotti2022The).

## Interactions
SEC11C is a subunit of the human signal peptidase complex (SPC), which is involved in cleaving signal sequences from proteins targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In mammals, SEC11C forms a paralogous complex with the accessory subunits SPCS1, SPCS2, and SPCS3, distinct from the complex formed by SEC11A. These complexes do not coexist, indicating a specific interaction pattern within the SPC (Zanotti2022The).

SEC11C may serve as a backup for SEC11A in certain cellular contexts. While SEC11A knockdown does not affect the cleavage of noncanonical substrates like Connexin32 (Cx32), SEC11C is not detected in cell lines with normal SEC11A levels, suggesting it might compensate for SEC11A loss under specific conditions. However, inhibition of SEC11A with cavinafungin, which can also bind to SEC11C, results in a complete block of noncanonical cleavage, indicating that SEC11C might not fully compensate when SEC11A is inhibited (Zanotti2022The).

The SPC, including SEC11C, may interact with a broader range of substrates than previously thought, including proteins without traditional signal sequences. This is supported by computational analyses identifying cryptic cleavage sites in proteins such as those in the Connexin family (Zanotti2022The).
