# GTF2H4

## Overview
The GTF2H4 gene encodes the general transcription factor IIH subunit 4, a critical component of the transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) complex. This protein plays a pivotal role in the processes of transcription initiation and nucleotide excision repair (NER), both of which are essential for maintaining genomic integrity. As part of the TFIIH complex, GTF2H4 is involved in the unwinding of DNA at transcription start sites, facilitating the action of RNA polymerase II, and is integral to the repair of bulky DNA lesions through the NER pathway. The protein is categorized as a transcription factor subunit, contributing to the structural and functional stability of the TFIIH complex. Disruptions in the function of GTF2H4, due to genetic mutations or alterations, have been linked to various diseases, including cancer, underscoring its importance in cellular homeostasis and disease prevention (Wang2016Genetic; Niazi2021DNA).

## Function
The GTF2H4 gene encodes a subunit of the general transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) complex, which plays a crucial role in both transcription initiation and nucleotide excision repair (NER) in DNA. In healthy human cells, GTF2H4 is involved in the unwinding of DNA around the transcription start site, facilitating the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II (Porter2019Wholegenome; Niazi2021DNA). This process is essential for the formation of the transcription pre-initiation complex, which is necessary for accurate gene expression (Niazi2021DNA).

In addition to its role in transcription, GTF2H4 is a key component of the NER pathway, which repairs bulky DNA lesions such as pyrimidine dimers and chemical adducts. This repair mechanism is vital for maintaining genomic stability and preventing mutations that could lead to diseases such as cancer (Wang2016Genetic). The GTF2H4 protein is active in the cell nucleus, where it contributes to the structural and functional integrity of the TFIIH complex, ensuring the proper execution of DNA repair and transcription processes (Porter2019Wholegenome). Defects in these processes can lead to increased cancer risk and other genomic instability-related conditions (Wang2016Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GTF2H4 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in DNA repair and transcription regulation. Variants in GTF2H4, such as rs114596632, have been associated with an increased risk of lung cancer. This variant affects DNA repair capacity and mRNA expression levels, potentially contributing to carcinogenesis by disturbing the binding efficiency of transcriptional repressors like ZEB1 (Wang2016Genetic). 

In the context of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), increased methylation of the GTF2H4 gene is linked to reduced expression in the retinal pigment epithelium, suggesting a role in the disease's pathogenesis (Porter2019Wholegenome). 

Additionally, GTF2H4 polymorphisms have been associated with breast cancer risk, with certain variants like rs1264308 showing a decreased risk (Ge2019Genetic). 

GTF2H4 is also involved in the outcomes of platinum-based chemotherapy for lung cancer, where specific SNPs are linked to survival rates and treatment efficacy (Song2017Single). These findings highlight the clinical significance of GTF2H4 in various diseases, particularly those related to DNA repair deficiencies.

## Interactions
GTF2H4, a component of the transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) complex, plays a significant role in nucleotide excision repair (NER) and transcription initiation. Within the TFIIH complex, GTF2H4 interacts with other subunits such as XPB and XPD, which are crucial for DNA unwinding and repair processes (Silva2014Evolutionary). The TFIIH complex is composed of a core subcomplex and a CDK-activating kinase (CAK) subcomplex, with GTF2H4 being part of the core subcomplex (Silva2014Evolutionary).

GTF2H4 is involved in the stabilization of TFIIH at DNA damage sites, a process facilitated by interactions with proteins like XPA and TTDA. These interactions are essential for anchoring TFIIH to DNA damage sites and enabling the XPD helicase to scan for lesions (MuniesaVargas2024Persistent). The presence of XPA is particularly important for forming a stable NER incision complex, while the absence of XPF or XPG can lead to prolonged TFIIH binding to DNA damage, indicating a lack of DNA damage excision (MuniesaVargas2024Persistent).

The interactions of GTF2H4 within the TFIIH complex and with other proteins are critical for its function in DNA repair and transcription, and disruptions in these interactions can lead to severe pathologies (MuniesaVargas2024Persistent).
