# MTHFD1L

## Overview
The MTHFD1L gene encodes the mitochondrial enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (NADP+ dependent) 1 like, which plays a pivotal role in folate metabolism. This enzyme is integral to the mitochondrial folate pathway, facilitating the conversion of 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate to formate, a crucial one-carbon donor for nucleotide biosynthesis and methylation reactions. The MTHFD1L protein is characterized by its bifunctional structure, comprising an inactive N-terminal domain and an active C-terminal formyl-THF synthetase domain, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (Tejada2022Mutations). The enzyme's function is vital for cellular processes such as DNA replication and repair, and it is particularly significant during early embryogenesis due to its role in DNA methylation reprogramming (Momb2012Deletion). Alterations in MTHFD1L expression and function have been linked to various clinical conditions, including neural tube defects and cancer, highlighting its importance in both normal physiology and disease states (ParleMcDermott2009A; He2020High).

## Structure
The MTHFD1L protein is involved in folate metabolism and plays a crucial role in the synthesis of tetrahydrofolate (THF) in the mitochondria. It consists of two main domains: an inactive N-terminal methylene-THF dehydrogenase and cyclohydrolase domain (amino acids 31 to 348) and an active C-terminal formyl-THF synthetase (FTHFS) domain (amino acids 349 to 978) (Tejada2022Mutations). The protein's structure has been modeled using tools like I-Tasser and Phyre2, with the best structural model refined using the Model Refiner tool. Ramachandran plots indicate that 83.8% of amino acids in the wild type are in the favorable zone, while 86.3% are in the favorable zone for the MTHFD1L-R564H variant (Tejada2022Mutations).

The MTHFD1L protein undergoes a change in hydrophobicity from amino acid 558 to 568 due to a variant, c.G1691A:p.R564H, which is located in the C-terminal domain. This variant may alter the protein's function by increasing hydrophobicity and changing the protein's topology (Tejada2022Mutations). The change from Arginine to Histidine in this variant does not alter the basic functional group nature but affects the binding distance, potentially altering the protein's functional domain (Tejada2022Mutations).

## Function
The MTHFD1L gene encodes a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a critical role in folate metabolism, specifically in the production of formate from 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate (10-formyl-THF). This enzyme is essential for the transfer of one-carbon (1C) units from mitochondria to the cytoplasm, a process vital for various cellular functions, including purine and thymidylate synthesis, which are crucial for DNA replication and repair (Momb2012Deletion). 

MTHFD1L is involved in the cytoplasmic methyl cycle, contributing to DNA methylation and chromatin modification, processes that are important for cell differentiation and migration (Momb2012Deletion). The enzyme's activity is particularly significant during early embryogenesis, where extensive DNA methylation reprogramming occurs (Momb2012Deletion). 

In healthy human cells, MTHFD1L supports the mitochondrial folate pathway, ensuring an adequate supply of formate, which is the preferred one-carbon donor for purine synthesis, essential for DNA and RNA synthesis (ParleMcDermott2009A). The enzyme's function is compartmentalized within the mitochondria, facilitating its role in maintaining the balance of one-carbon units necessary for nucleotide biosynthesis and methylation reactions (ParleMcDermott2009A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the MTHFD1L gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In embryonic development, MTHFD1L is crucial for neural tube closure, and its disruption can lead to neural tube defects (NTDs) such as craniorachischisis and exencephaly. These defects are linked to a specific metabolic defect rather than a cellular folate deficiency (Momb2012Deletion). A common variant in MTHFD1L, rs3832406, affects mRNA splicing efficiency and is associated with an increased risk of NTDs (ParleMcDermott2009A).

In cancer, high expression of MTHFD1L is associated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer (CRC), promoting increased proliferation and migration of cancer cells. This makes MTHFD1L a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in CRC (He2020High). Similarly, in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), MTHFD1L provides metabolic advantages to cancer cells and is regulated by the NRF2 pathway, although its expression is not significantly correlated with NRF2 mutations (Lee2017Folate). High MTHFD1L expression is also linked to worse outcomes in various other cancers, including bladder and liver cancers, suggesting its role as an oncogene (Yan2022Identification).

## Interactions
MTHFD1L, a key enzyme in the folate cycle, is involved in various protein interactions that contribute to its role in cellular metabolism and cancer progression. It physically interacts with proteins such as CLPP, CS, LRPPRC, and MTIF2, which may play a role in its involvement in carcinogenesis (Yan2022Identification). These interactions suggest that MTHFD1L is part of a network that influences metabolic processes and cell cycle regulation, potentially impacting tumor development (Yan2022Identification).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), MTHFD1L is regulated by the NRF2 pathway, a key mechanism in redox homeostasis. NRF2 binds to antioxidant response elements (AREs) in the MTHFD1L gene, modulating its expression and linking it to oxidative stress responses (Lee2017Folate). This interaction highlights the enzyme's role in providing metabolic advantages to cancer cells by maintaining redox balance and supporting cell proliferation (Lee2017Folate).

In osteosarcoma, MTHFD1L is associated with the activation of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell cycle progression and cancer cell survival. Silencing MTHFD1L results in decreased activity of AKT/mTOR pathway-related proteins, indicating its role in mediating these signaling interactions (Wang2020MTHFD1L).
