# RMND5A

## Overview
RMND5A is a gene that encodes the protein required for meiotic nuclear division 5 homolog A, a crucial component of the CTLH E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This protein is characterized by its RING domain, which is essential for its ubiquitin-ligase activity, and plays a significant role in protein degradation and cellular homeostasis. The RMND5A protein is involved in the regulation of cellular energy balance and metabolic processes, contributing to cell proliferation and differentiation. It interacts with various proteins within the CTLH complex, forming a catalytic core necessary for ubiquitination activity. RMND5A's function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase is vital for maintaining protein stability and regulating degradation pathways, underscoring its importance in cellular function and organismal development (Maitland2019The; Maitland2022Structural).

## Structure
The RMND5A protein is a component of the CTLH E3 ligase complex and plays a crucial role in its structural and functional integrity. The protein contains a RING domain, which is essential for its ubiquitin-ligase activity. This domain is characterized by a unique heart-shaped structure that coordinates a single zinc ion, differing from typical RING domains that bind two zinc ions. This structural feature is vital for the stability and function of the RMND5A-Gid9/MAEA dimer, which is necessary for the complex's activity in both yeast and human cells (Maitland2022Structural).

The RING domain of RMND5A includes specific residues that form a hydrophobic E2-binding site, crucial for ubiquitin transfer. The protein's structure is further stabilized by zinc binding, which is essential for proper folding (Maitland2022Structural). RMND5A also contains a CTLH/LisH domain, which is important for its function as a ubiquitin-ligase (Pfirrmann2015RMND5).

In terms of quaternary structure, RMND5A forms a RING domain heterodimer with MAEA, which is critical for the E3 ligase activity of the CTLH complex. This dimerization is necessary for binding the E2 enzyme UBE2H and facilitating ubiquitin transfer to substrates (Maitland2022Structural; Lampert2018The).

## Function
The RMND5A gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the CTLH complex, a multi-subunit E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in protein degradation and cellular homeostasis. In healthy human cells, RMND5A functions as part of this complex to regulate the ubiquitination and degradation of specific proteins, such as muskelin, thereby maintaining protein stability and homeostasis (Maitland2019The). RMND5A, along with MAEA, forms a RING domain heterodimer essential for the E3 ligase activity of the CTLH complex, facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin to substrates (Maitland2022Structural).

RMND5A also plays a role in regulating cellular energy balance and metabolic processes. It is involved in the modulation of AMPK activity, a key regulator of cellular energy homeostasis, through ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation mechanisms (liu2020gid). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to cell proliferation and differentiation (Maitland2022Structural). RMND5A's involvement in these molecular processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular function and organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RMND5A gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions. RMND5A is part of the CTLH complex, which plays a role in cell proliferation and tumor formation. Knockout studies in HEK293 cells have shown increased cell growth, suggesting that RMND5A may act as a tumor suppressor. Its involvement in the ubiquitination of c-Raf kinase, affecting MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, may contribute to tumorigenic phenotypes (Maitland2022Structural).

RMND5A is also linked to neurodevelopmental conditions. A case report described a neurodevelopmental defect, specifically a giant occipitoparietal meningoencephalocele, associated with a duplication of the RMND5A gene, indicating a potential link between RMND5A gene alterations and neurodevelopmental disorders (Pfirrmann2015RMND5).

In metabolic regulation, RMND5A is part of the GID ubiquitin ligase complex, which negatively regulates AMPK activity. Alterations in RMND5A expression can lead to increased AMPK activity, enhanced autophagic flux, and reduced MTOR activation, which may have implications for metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and morbid obesity (Liu2019The).

## Interactions
RMND5A is a core component of the CTLH complex, a multi-subunit E3 ubiquitin ligase. It interacts with several proteins within this complex, including RanBPM, TWA1, MAEA, muskelin, ARMC8, WDR26, and GID4 (Maitland2019The). RMND5A forms a catalytic core with MAEA and TWA1, which is essential for the complex's ubiquitination activity (Lampert2018The). The interaction between RMND5A and MAEA is crucial for their mutual stability, as the knockout of either protein significantly reduces the levels of the other (Maitland2019The).

RMND5A also interacts with E2 enzymes such as UBE2D1, UBE2D2, and UBE2D3, facilitating the formation of K48 and K63 polyubiquitin chains (Maitland2019The). It has been shown to work optimally with UBE2D1 (UbcH5a) and UBE2D2 (UbcH5b) for its ubiquitination activity (Maitland2019The). RMND5A is involved in the proteasome-dependent degradation of muskelin, a subunit of the CTLH complex, indicating a regulatory role in protein stability (Maitland2019The).

The GID complex, which includes RMND5A, predominantly accumulates in the nucleus and targets nuclear proteins like the transcription factor Hbp1 for degradation (Lampert2018The). RMND5A's interactions within the CTLH complex are vital for its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, contributing to the regulation of protein degradation pathways.
