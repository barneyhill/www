# TMBIM6

## Overview
TMBIM6, also known as Bax Inhibitor-1 (BI-1), is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in the regulation of apoptosis and cellular homeostasis. The TMBIM6 protein is characterized by its multiple transmembrane domains and is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it functions as a calcium leak channel. This protein plays a significant role in modulating ER calcium homeostasis, which is crucial for cell survival and apoptosis regulation. TMBIM6 interacts with various proteins, including members of the BCL-2 family, and is involved in key cellular processes such as the unfolded protein response and mTORC2 signaling. Its expression levels have been linked to various diseases, particularly cancer, where it can act as an oncogene or tumor suppressor depending on the context (Bhattarai2021TMBIM6; Kim2020TMBIM6BI1; RojasRivera2014TMBIM).

## Structure
The TMBIM6 protein, also known as Bax Inhibitor-1 (BI-1), is characterized by its structure comprising six to seven transmembrane domains, primarily featuring α-helical structures (Doycheva2019The; Kim2020TMBIM6BI1). The protein's topology includes both the N- and C-termini exposed to the cytosol, with the C-terminus playing a crucial role in its protective functions against apoptosis (Doycheva2019The). TMBIM6 is involved in calcium regulation, acting as a calcium leak channel, and its calcium-binding activity is influenced by pH, facilitated by a conserved aspartyl dyad (Asp171-Asp195) that regulates the channel's pore opening and closing (Kim2020TMBIM6).

The protein's structure is further defined by the presence of a consensus motif termed UPF0005, which is conserved across various species and is responsible for its localization in organelle membranes (RojasRivera2014TMBIM). TMBIM6 interacts with other proteins, such as RICTOR and ribosomal proteins, which are essential for its role in mTORC2 activation and function (Kim2020TMBIM6BI1). The protein is also known to undergo post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which may affect its function and interactions (Bhattarai2021TMBIM6).

## Function
TMBIM6, also known as Bax Inhibitor-1 (BI-1), is a transmembrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that plays a crucial role in regulating apoptosis and maintaining cellular homeostasis. It is involved in modulating ER calcium homeostasis, which is significant for cell survival and apoptosis regulation. TMBIM6 can function as a Ca2+ channel, a Ca2+/H+ antiporter, or an IP3 receptor-sensitizing protein, influencing ER calcium content and release (RojasRivera2014TMBIM). 

TMBIM6 interacts with BCL-2 family proteins, such as BCL-XL, and forms complexes that affect ER calcium homeostasis, thereby influencing cell susceptibility to apoptosis (RojasRivera2014TMBIM). It also inhibits the activity of IRE1α, a key component of the unfolded protein response (UPR), by binding to its cytosolic domain, which is crucial for attenuating IRE1α signaling during prolonged ER stress (RojasRivera2014TMBIM). 

In human hepatic cells, overexpression of TMBIM6 reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) generation, decreases lipid accumulation, and reduces markers of cellular senescence, indicating its role in mitigating oxidative stress and maintaining cellular health (Bhattarai2021TMBIM6).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TMBIM6 gene, also known as BI-1, have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer. TMBIM6 is overexpressed in several cancer types, including lung adenocarcinoma, breast cancer, prostate cancer, glioma, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where it acts as an oncogene. Its overexpression is associated with cancer cell survival, proliferation, and metastasis, making it a potential target for cancer therapy (Kim2020TMBIM6BI1; RojasRivera2014TMBIM; Zhang2023STRIP2). In NSCLC, TMBIM6 is part of the STRIP2-IGF2BP3-TMBIM6 axis, which is crucial for cancer progression and is linked to poor prognosis (Zhang2023STRIP2).

Conversely, TMBIM6 expression is downregulated in some stomach, colon, kidney, lung, and rectal cancers, suggesting a complex role in cancer biology (RojasRivera2014TMBIM). In the context of aging and liver degeneration, decreased TMBIM6 expression is associated with increased oxidative stress, hepatic steatosis, and impaired endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, indicating its protective role against age-related diseases (Bhattarai2021TMBIM6). TMBIM6 deficiency leads to increased apoptosis and impaired autophagy, further linking its expression to cellular stress responses and survival (Bhattarai2021TMBIM6).

## Interactions
TMBIM6, also known as BI-1, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. It forms complexes with BCL-2 and BCL-XL, but not with BAX or BAK, suggesting its antiapoptotic activity may be mediated through interaction with BCL-2 family proteins (RojasRivera2014TMBIM). TMBIM6 interacts with the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (ITPR1), which is involved in calcium signaling, although the calcium leak function of TMBIM6 appears to be independent of this interaction (Kim2020TMBIM6).

TMBIM6 also plays a role in cancer progression through its interactions with mTORC2 components, specifically RICTOR, and ribosomal proteins such as RPL19. These interactions are crucial for mTORC2's kinase activity, which is involved in cell metabolism and cancer progression (Kim2020TMBIM6BI1). TMBIM6's interaction with mTORC2 is influenced by calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum, which is regulated by TMBIM6 and is necessary for mTORC2 activation (Kim2020TMBIM6BI1).

Additionally, TMBIM6 interacts with IRE1α, inhibiting its activity by binding to its cytosolic domain, which is crucial for modulating ER stress signaling pathways (RojasRivera2014TMBIM). These interactions highlight TMBIM6's multifaceted role in regulating apoptosis, calcium signaling, and cancer progression.
