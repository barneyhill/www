# MRPS2

## Overview
The MRPS2 gene encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S2, which is a vital component of the small 28S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein is integral to the process of mitochondrial protein synthesis, facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into functional proteins necessary for mitochondrial function and cellular energy production (O’Brien2003Properties). As a mitochondrial ribosomal protein, MRPS2 is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, underscoring its essential role in cellular processes (Cheong2020Expression). The protein is homologous to the yeast MRP4p and is involved in the assembly and function of the mitoribosome, which is crucial for translating hydrophobic and integral membrane proteins within mitochondria (Gopisetty2016Mammalian). Additionally, MRPS2 may have roles beyond mitochondrial translation, potentially participating in DNA repair mechanisms (Revathi2021Expression).

## Function
MRPS2 encodes a mitochondrial ribosomal protein that is a component of the small 28S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein plays a critical role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into functional proteins, which is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production in cells (O’Brien2003Properties). MRPS2 is homologous to the yeast MRP4p and has a molecular weight of 30.1 kDa with an isoelectric point of 9.1 (O’Brien2003Properties).

The protein is involved in the assembly and function of the mitoribosome, which is crucial for translating hydrophobic and integral membrane proteins within mitochondria (Gopisetty2016Mammalian). The mitoribosome's unique structure, characterized by high protein content and reduced rRNA exposure, may protect it from reactive oxygen species, ensuring efficient mitochondrial translation (Gopisetty2016Mammalian). MRPS2, like other mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, is expressed ubiquitously across tissues, indicating its essential role in cellular processes (Cheong2020Expression). Although MRPS2 is primarily involved in mitochondrial translation, it may also participate in other cellular processes, such as DNA repair mechanisms, as suggested by its potential role in excision repair (Revathi2021Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MRPS2 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, primarily due to its role in mitochondrial function. A notable case involves a homozygous C.412C > G variant in the MRPS2 gene, identified in a Chinese girl, which led to severe hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis. This mutation also resulted in clinical manifestations such as recurrent vomiting, sensorineural hearing loss, and gall bladder calculi. The condition improved with sugary liquid and supportive treatments, highlighting the potential for management with early intervention (Liu2022Hypoglycemia).

MRPS2 mutations are associated with recurrent hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis, conditions that arise from defects in mitochondrial translation, leading to oxidative phosphorylation system deficiencies (Kline2022Integral). These mutations can also result in hypotonia, hyperlacticacidemia, and growth retardation, reflecting the broad heterogeneity of clinical presentations linked to mitochondrial ribosomal defects (Jackson2018A).

Altered expression of MRPS2 has been observed in certain cancers, such as bladder and colorectal cancers, where it is upregulated. This suggests a potential role in cancer pathology, although further investigation is needed to fully understand its implications (Gopisetty2016Mammalian).

## Interactions
MRPS2, a component of the mitochondrial ribosomal small subunit (28S), is involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis. It predominantly interacts with other proteins of the 28S mitochondrial ribosomal subunit. MRPS2 has been identified as a significant interaction partner of the human gene C4orf14, which is involved in the biogenesis of the small mitochondrial ribosomal subunit. This interaction is supported by tandem affinity purification and SILAC coupled with Orbitrap LC/MS/MS experiments, which confirmed MRPS2 as a major binding partner of C4orf14 (He2012Human).

MRPS2 is also part of the mitochondrial nucleoid complex, which supports mitochondrial protein synthesis. Immunoblot analysis has shown that MRPS2 co-purifies with other mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, indicating its role in the translation process within mitochondria (He2012Mitochondrial). Gene silencing experiments have demonstrated that reduced expression of C4orf14 leads to decreased levels of MRPS2, further suggesting a functional interaction between these proteins in mitochondrial translation (He2012Human).

While MRPS2 is primarily associated with mitochondrial translation, studies have explored its potential extramitochondrial roles, although specific interactions outside the mitochondrial context are not detailed (Revathi2021Expression).
