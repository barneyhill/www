# IQGAP3

## Overview
IQGAP3 is a gene that encodes the protein IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 3, which is a member of the IQGAP family. This protein is characterized by its role as a scaffold in cellular signaling and cytoskeletal organization, interacting with small GTPases such as Rac1 and Cdc42, and binding to F-actin through its calponin homology domain (Wang2007IQGAP3). IQGAP3 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell division, neurite outgrowth, and intracellular signaling pathways like the MAPK pathway (Adachi2014Involvement; Hedman2015The). It plays a significant role in maintaining tissue homeostasis and is implicated in the proliferation of stem cells in the stomach corpus (Matsuo2020Iqgap3Ras). Clinically, IQGAP3 is associated with the progression of several cancers, including pancreatic, lung, gastric, and colorectal cancers, where its overexpression correlates with poor prognosis and advanced disease stages (Zeng2020IQGAP3; Kido2023IQ; Jinawath2020Enhancement).

## Structure
IQGAP3 is a member of the IQGAP family, characterized by several conserved domains that contribute to its role in cellular signaling and cytoskeletal organization. The protein contains a calponin homology domain (CHD) at the N-terminus, which facilitates binding to F-actin, and a RasGAP-related domain (GRD) that interacts with small GTPases such as Rac1 and Cdc42 (Wang2007IQGAP3). IQGAP3 also includes multiple IQ motifs, which are calmodulin-binding domains. These motifs interact with calmodulin in the presence of calcium ions, with varying degrees of stability and affinity (Atcheson2011IQmotif).

The protein's structure is further defined by a polyproline-binding region (WW domain) and a C-terminal domain that may interact with other proteins, although specific details on the tertiary and quaternary structures are not provided in the available literature (Monteleon2015IQGAP1). IQGAP3 is known to play a critical role in neurite outgrowth and axon elongation, suggesting its involvement in cytoskeletal reorganization and stabilization of activated Rac1 and Cdc42 (Wang2007IQGAP3). The specific post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms of IQGAP3 remain uncharacterized in the current context.

## Function
IQGAP3 is a protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, particularly in cell division and signaling pathways. In mammalian cells, IQGAP3 is involved in cytokinesis, the final step of cell division, where it localizes to the equatorial cortex during anaphase. It interacts with anillin, a scaffolding protein, to ensure the proper localization of key cytokinesis proteins to the contractile ring, which is essential for successful cell division (Adachi2014Involvement). 

IQGAP3 also plays a significant role in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics and intracellular signaling. It acts as a scaffold for various signaling pathways, including the MAPK pathway, which is crucial for cellular responses to stimuli and impacts physiology across different tissues (Hedman2015The). In the context of epidermal homeostasis, IQGAP3 is essential for maintaining keratinocyte proliferation and is concentrated within the proliferative basal layer of the skin (Monteleon2015IQGAP1). 

In the stomach corpus, IQGAP3 is a marker for rapidly proliferating isthmus stem cells and is necessary for promoting Ras-driven proliferation, maintaining tissue homeostasis, and facilitating tissue repair (Matsuo2020Iqgap3Ras).

## Clinical Significance
IQGAP3 is implicated in the progression and prognosis of several cancers. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), IQGAP3 is strongly expressed in tumor tissues but not in non-neoplastic pancreatic ductal cells. Its expression is associated with poorer prognosis and is considered an independent prognostic factor for poor clinical outcomes (Kido2023IQ). In lung cancer, IQGAP3 is upregulated and linked to poor overall survival, advanced tumor stage, and lymph node metastasis. It plays a role in DNA damage repair pathways, contributing to radioresistance (Zeng2020IQGAP3). 

In gastric cancer, IQGAP3 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and advanced disease stages. It influences cell migration and invasion, potentially through interactions with e-cadherin and β-catenin, and is involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Oue2017Overexpression; Jinawath2020Enhancement). In colorectal cancer, high IQGAP3 expression correlates with advanced tumor stages and lower survival rates, serving as an independent prognostic marker (Wu2019High). 

IQGAP3 is also overexpressed in glioma, where it is associated with immune-suppressive microenvironments and poor prognosis, highlighting its potential as an immune and prognostic marker (GAO2024IQGAP3).

## Interactions
IQGAP3 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It acts as an effector for the small GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42, directly interacting with their activated forms. This interaction is crucial for its role in neurite outgrowth, as demonstrated in studies using PC12 cells (Wang2007IQGAP3). IQGAP3 also binds to F-actin through its calponin homology domain, which is essential for its function in cytoskeletal organization and neurite outgrowth (Wang2007IQGAP3).

In the context of cancer, IQGAP3 interacts with ERK1, promoting EGF-induced ERK activation, which is associated with tumor growth and metastasis in lung cancer cells. This interaction is specific to ERK1, distinguishing it from IQGAP1, which primarily binds to ERK2 (Yang2014IQGAP3). IQGAP3's role in modulating EGFR-ERK signaling highlights its involvement in oncogenic pathways (Yang2014IQGAP3).

IQGAP3 is also implicated in cytokinesis, where it is recruited to the actomyosin ring, interacting with components necessary for cell division. Its depletion leads to defects in cytokinesis, underscoring its role in cell cycle regulation (Hedman2015The).
