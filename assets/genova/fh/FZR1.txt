# FZR1

## Overview
FZR1 is a gene that encodes the protein fizzy and cell division cycle 20 related 1, commonly referred to as FZR1 or CDH1. This protein is a regulatory component of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a pivotal E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in cell cycle regulation. As a coactivator of APC/C, FZR1 plays a critical role in the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase of the cell cycle by facilitating the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of key cell cycle proteins, such as mitotic cyclins and securin (LI2023The; Sigl2009Loss). FZR1 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it ensures proper cell cycle progression and genomic stability by regulating the abundance of G1 phase regulators (Sigl2009Loss). The protein's function is modulated by phosphorylation, which is crucial for its inactivation and the progression of the cell cycle (The2015Rb). FZR1's interactions with various proteins, including the retinoblastoma protein and BRAF, underscore its importance in cellular proliferation and signaling pathways, with significant implications for cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders (LI2023The; Wan2017The).

## Structure


## Function
The FZR1 gene encodes a protein that functions as an activator of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a crucial E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in cell cycle regulation. In healthy human cells, FZR1 plays a significant role in the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase of the cell cycle. It is essential for maintaining the G1 phase by controlling the degradation of specific proteins, such as mitotic cyclins and the F-box protein SKP2, which prevents premature entry into the S phase (Sigl2009Loss).

FZR1 is involved in the regulation of DNA replication timing and helps establish pre-replicative complexes on DNA replication origins by providing a time window with low CDK activity (Sigl2009Loss). The protein is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it regulates the abundance of G1 phase regulators, ensuring proper cell cycle progression and genomic stability (Sigl2009Loss).

Phosphorylation of FZR1 by CDK4-cyclin D is important for its inactivation, which allows for the progression of the cell cycle by inducing CDK2-cyclin E activity, leading to S phase entry (The2015Rb). This regulatory mechanism highlights FZR1's critical role in cell cycle control and its impact on cellular proliferation and DNA-damage responses (Sigl2009Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FZR1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders. In breast cancer, FZR1 expression levels are associated with the effectiveness of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). High FZR1 expression correlates with better responses to NACT, while its downregulation is linked to poor outcomes. FZR1 influences chemotherapy-induced apoptosis by regulating p53 stability, and its knockout leads to increased resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs (Liu2020FZR1).

In melanoma, FZR1 acts as a tumor suppressor by regulating BRAF oncogenic functions. It inhibits BRAF through APC-dependent proteolysis and APC-independent disruption of BRAF dimers. Loss of FZR1 function can lead to BRAF hyperactivation, contributing to melanoma progression. FZR1 deficiency, often due to genetic inactivation or phosphorylation, results in elevated oncogenic signaling pathways, such as ERK and AKT, promoting tumorigenesis (Wan2017The).

A novel mutation in the FZR1 gene, resulting in an aspartate-to-glycine substitution, has been linked to severe neurodevelopmental disorders, including microcephaly, psychomotor retardation, and epilepsy. This mutation impairs APC/C activity, crucial for cell cycle regulation, leading to decreased Cdh1 protein levels and disrupted neuronal differentiation (Rodríguez2019A).

## Interactions
FZR1, also known as CDH1, is a regulatory protein that interacts with the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a crucial E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in cell cycle regulation. FZR1 acts as a coactivator of APC/C, facilitating the ubiquitination and degradation of various cell cycle proteins, including mitotic cyclins and securin (LI2023The; Medley2017APCCFZR1). It competes with CDC20 for binding to APC/C, influencing the degradation of mitotic cyclins and other substrates (LI2023The).

FZR1 interacts with the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) in the G1/G0 phase, and this interaction is necessary for the transition to the S phase (LI2023The). It also binds to the LxCxE-binding vesicle of pRB via a cysteine residue in its LxCxD motif (LI2023The). FZR1 is involved in the regulation of the G1 phase of the cell cycle, where it interacts with proteins such as Cln-Cdc28 kinase to induce G1 cell cycle arrest (LI2023The).

FZR1 disrupts BRAF dimerization, a key mechanism in regulating BRAF activation in tumor cells, and can inhibit the phosphorylation of MEK1 by BRAF kinase, suggesting a regulatory role in the BRAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway (Wan2017The). It also interacts with proteins like CDC20, Aurora kinase, and polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) to ensure proper mitotic exit (LI2023The).
