# C6orf141

## Overview
C6orf141 is a gene located on chromosome 6 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 6 open reading frame 141. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. Emerging research suggests that C6orf141 may play a role in tumor suppression, particularly in cancers such as oral squamous cell carcinoma and breast cancer. The protein encoded by C6orf141 is implicated in alternative splicing events and may influence cancer prognosis and treatment responses (Wang2020Transcriptomewide; Yang2019Low). Additionally, the expression of C6orf141 is subject to regulation by factors such as cetuximab and epigenetic modifications, including promoter methylation, which further underscores its potential significance in oncological research and therapy (Ghobadi2023Potential; Yang2019Low).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the C6orf141 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), low expression of C6orf141 is significantly associated with poor prognosis, advanced pathological stages, and larger tumor sizes. It acts as a tumor suppressor, with its reduced expression correlating with shorter disease-specific survival rates, particularly in buccal mucosa squamous cell carcinoma (Yang2019Low). The gene's expression is influenced by cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody used in cancer treatment, and its depletion may involve mechanisms such as ZNF217 amplification and miR-335 expression (Yang2019Low).

In invasive breast cancer, C6orf141 is involved in alternative splicing events that are linked to patient prognosis. An alternate terminator splicing event in C6orf141 is considered a risk factor, with higher expression levels associated with lower survival probabilities (Wang2020Transcriptomewide). The gene's exon-specific expression is also associated with responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, suggesting its potential as a target for breast cancer treatment (Wang2020Transcriptomewide).

C6orf141 has also been identified as a tumor repressor in oral cancer, with its promoter CpG islands being methylated in some cancers, which is associated with high-density lipoprotein alterations (Ghobadi2023Potential).
