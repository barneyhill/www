# FEM1B

## Overview
FEM1B is a gene that encodes the fem-1 homolog B protein, which is a crucial component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, specifically as part of the CRL2 (Cullin-RING Ligase 2) complex. This protein is characterized by its structural motifs, including ankyrin and tetratricopeptide repeats, which facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions and substrate recognition. FEM1B is involved in the regulation of apoptosis and cell signaling pathways, playing a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by targeting specific proteins for ubiquitination and degradation. Its interactions with various apoptosis-inducing proteins and involvement in histone mRNA regulation underscore its importance in cellular processes such as programmed cell death and cell cycle progression. FEM1B's function and interactions have implications in several clinical contexts, including cancer, neurodevelopmental disorders, and metabolic diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Cai2016The; Chen2024Mechanism; Dankert2017FEM1).

## Structure
The FEM1B protein is a component of the CRL2 FEM1B complex, which includes elongin B, elongin C, CUL2, and RBX1. The protein features a V-shaped architecture with seven N-terminal ankyrin repeats (ANK1-7), five tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR1-5), and three C-terminal ankyrin repeats (ANK8-10), followed by a putative VHL box (VB) (Chen2024Mechanism). The VB adopts a helix-turn-helix conformation and interacts with elongin C and CUL2 through hydrophobic interactions (Chen2024Mechanism). The FEM1B protein forms symmetric and asymmetric dimers, with dimerization states influenced by neddylation, which activates the complex by converting an asymmetric dimer to an active form (Chen2024Mechanism).

The ankyrin repeats in FEM1B are involved in protein-protein interactions, a common feature of these motifs (Shi2011Mouse). FEM1B's interaction with C-degrons involves a bipartite mechanism, utilizing an Arg/C-degron binding site and a hydrophobic pocket (Chen2024Mechanism). The protein's ability to bind long C-degrons ending with proline is distinct from other degrons, which typically end with arginine or contain a zinc-binding motif (Chen2024Mechanism). The structural flexibility of FEM1B in substrate recognition is crucial for its role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Chen2024Mechanism).

## Function
FEM1B (fem-1 homolog B) is a protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of apoptosis and cell signaling pathways in healthy human cells. It is a component of the CRL2 (Cullin-RING Ligase 2) complex, which is involved in targeting proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. This process is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating various cellular functions (Cai2016The). FEM1B is known to interact with the homeodomain protein Nkx3.1, which is a regulator of prostate development, indicating its involvement in sexual dimorphism (Cai2016The).

In the context of apoptosis, FEM1B acts as a proapoptotic protein, interacting with apoptosis-inducing proteins such as Fas, tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNFR1), and apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1). This interaction suggests that FEM1B is part of a pathway that promotes programmed cell death, which is essential for normal cellular turnover and the prevention of tumorigenesis (Huang2015Analysis).

FEM1B is also involved in the degradation of the Stem-Loop Binding Protein (SLBP), a process that is crucial for the regulation of histone mRNA levels during the cell cycle. This function highlights its role in synchronizing histone metabolism with cell cycle progression (Dankert2017FEM1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the FEM1B gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In neurodevelopmental disorders, a de novo missense variant in FEM1B has been identified in patients with syndromic global developmental delay, suggesting a potential link between FEM1B mutations and these disorders (Lecoquierre2019Variant). 

In the context of cancer, FEM1B is involved in apoptosis and has been shown to be downregulated in malignant colon cancer cells. Its overexpression can induce apoptosis in mammalian cells, indicating its potential role in cancer therapy (Wang2016Atlas). In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), FEM1B is overexpressed and is part of an apoptosis pathway involving PHTF1 and Apaf-1, which may be significant in tumor cell apoptosis (Huang2015Analysis).

FEM1B is also associated with metabolic disorders, particularly type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). It has been linked to T2DM risk in the southern Indian population, with its expression affecting insulin signaling and glucose regulation (Irgam2021The). These findings suggest that FEM1B plays a multifaceted role in various diseases, primarily through its involvement in apoptosis and metabolic regulation.

## Interactions
FEM1B is a component of the CRL2 ubiquitin ligase complex, which includes CUL2, RBX1, elongin B, and elongin C. It plays a crucial role in substrate recognition and ubiquitination, particularly targeting proteins with specific C-degrons for degradation (Chen2024Mechanism). FEM1B forms oligomers in vivo, which is essential for its interaction with CUL2 and the stabilization of the CRL2 FEM1B complex. This dimerization is necessary for optimal ubiquitin transfer, although it does not affect substrate binding affinity (Chen2024Mechanism).

FEM1B interacts with various proteins through its degron-binding pockets, recognizing C-degrons that often end with a proline and contain upstream aromatic residues. It binds to proteins such as CCDC89, CUX1, and CDK5R1, with specific residues in these substrates being critical for binding (Chen2024Mechanism). FEM1B also interacts with the Stem-Loop Binding Protein (SLBP), mediating its degradation through the CRL2 complex. This interaction is evolutionarily conserved across species, highlighting FEM1B's role in targeting SLBP for proteasome-mediated degradation (Dankert2017FEM1).
