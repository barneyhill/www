# FEZF1

## Overview
FEZF1 (FEZ family zinc finger 1) is a gene that encodes a transcription factor belonging to the C2H2 zinc finger protein family, which is highly conserved across species. The protein product, FEZ family zinc finger 1, plays a pivotal role in the development of the nervous system, particularly in the maturation of olfactory sensory neurons during embryonic development (García-García2021The). As a transcription factor, it is primarily active in the nucleus, where it regulates gene expression by binding to DNA, thereby influencing neuronal differentiation and axon guidance (García-García2021The). FEZF1 is expressed in various human tissues, including the brain and testis, and has been implicated in several cancers, such as glioma and lung squamous cell carcinoma, where it may serve as a potential biomarker or therapeutic target (Liu2023Heterogeneous; Yu2017RETRACTED).

## Structure


## Function
FEZF1 (FEZ family zinc finger 1) is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in the development of the nervous system. It is involved in neurogenesis, particularly in the maturation of olfactory sensory neurons during embryonic development (García-García2021The). FEZF1 is part of the C2H2 zinc finger protein family and is highly conserved, indicating its essential function in brain development and cell identity (García-García2021The). In healthy cells, FEZF1 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it regulates gene expression by binding to DNA. This activity is crucial for proper neuronal differentiation and axon guidance, ensuring the correct formation and function of neural circuits (García-García2021The).

In FEZF1 knock-out mice, olfactory neurons fail to mature, underscoring its importance in neural development (García-García2021The). FEZF1 is expressed in normal human tissues such as the brain and testis, although at much lower levels than in certain cancerous cells like those in Ewing sarcoma (García-García2021The). Despite its well-documented role in the nervous system, the specific functions of FEZF1 in other healthy human tissues remain less understood.

## Clinical Significance
FEZF1 (FEZ family zinc finger 1) is implicated in various cancers due to its role in promoting oncogenic processes. In glioma stem cells (GSCs), FEZF1 is up-regulated and contributes to malignant progression by enhancing the expression of the oncogene CDC25A, which activates the PI3K/AKT pathway. This pathway is crucial for cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while inhibiting apoptosis, thereby promoting glioma progression (Yu2017RETRACTED). FEZF1 is also involved in the linc00152/miR-103a-3p/FEZF1/CDC25A pathway, where it is a direct target of miR-103a-3p, a tumor suppressor. Alterations in this pathway are associated with glioma, suggesting potential therapeutic targets (Yu2017RETRACTED).

In lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), FEZF1 is part of a prognostic model where its expression level is correlated with patient outcomes. Low expression of FEZF1 is associated with poor prognosis, indicating its potential role as a biomarker for LUSC (Liu2023Heterogeneous).

FEZF1 is also linked to cervical cancer, where its knockdown reduces cell proliferation and migration, suggesting its involvement in cancer recurrence (Liu2023Heterogeneous).

## Interactions
FEZF1, a transcription factor involved in neural development, is known for its interactions with DNA and other proteins to regulate gene expression. It shares functional similarities with FEZF2, particularly in their DNA binding domains, which consist of six C2H2 zinc-finger motifs. This structural similarity suggests that FEZF1 can bind to the same DNA regulatory sequences as FEZF2, potentially regulating similar sets of genes (Eckler2011Fezf1). The N-terminal region of FEZF1 has homology to the engrailed repressor domain, which can interact with the groucho/TLE family of co-repressors, indicating a potential physical interaction with these co-repressors (Eckler2011Fezf1).

In the context of Ewing sarcoma, FEZF1 is regulated by the EWSR1-FLI1 fusion protein, which binds to GGAA-microsatellites in the FEZF1 gene, specifically in intron 1. This interaction is associated with transcriptionally active sites marked by H3K27ac, suggesting that EWSR1-FLI1 activates FEZF1 transcription through this mechanism (García-García2021The). Although the specific physical interactions of FEZF1 with other proteins or nucleic acids in Ewing sarcoma are not detailed, its role in gene regulation and potential involvement in oncogenesis are highlighted (García-García2021The).
