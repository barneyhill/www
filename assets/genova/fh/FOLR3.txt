# FOLR3

## Overview
FOLR3 is a gene that encodes the folate receptor gamma, a member of the folate receptor family, which plays a crucial role in the transport and metabolism of folate. Unlike other folate receptors, folate receptor gamma is a secretory protein that lacks a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, which influences its cellular localization and function. The protein is involved in the regulation of homocysteine and folic acid levels, contributing to cellular growth and protection against homocysteine-induced damage. It is primarily expressed in hematopoietic tissues such as the spleen and bone marrow. FOLR3 has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer, where its expression and methylation status may influence disease progression and treatment outcomes (Yoshitomi2020Plasma; Qu2024Blood).

## Structure
FOLR3 encodes the folate receptor gamma, a protein involved in the transport of folate. The primary structure of FOLR3 is characterized by a high content of cysteine residues, which are crucial for the formation of disulfide bonds that stabilize the protein's tertiary structure. The secondary structure of FOLR3 includes both alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its overall stability and function. Unlike other folate receptors, FOLR3 lacks a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, which typically aids in membrane attachment. This structural difference may influence its localization and function within the cell.

FOLR3 also exhibits splice variant isoforms, which may result in differences in its structure and function. These isoforms could potentially alter the protein's ability to bind folate or interact with other cellular components. The absence of a GPI-anchor and the presence of splice variants suggest that FOLR3 might have unique roles compared to other members of the folate receptor family. The structural features of FOLR3, including its cysteine-rich composition and the presence of disulfide bonds, are essential for its stability and function in folate transport.

## Function
The FOLR3 gene encodes the folate receptor gamma, a secretory protein involved in the metabolism of homocysteine and folic acid bioavailability. FOLR3 is secreted into the cell supernatant and is associated with lower plasma homocysteine levels, suggesting its role in folic acid uptake and protection against homocysteine-induced damage (Yoshitomi2020Plasma). The protein enhances folic acid bioavailability, which supports cell growth and reduces plasma homocysteine levels. Experiments with FOLR3-overexpressed cells showed increased folic acid uptake and enhanced cell growth, particularly in the presence of folic acid (Yoshitomi2020Plasma).

FOLR3 is a secretory protein that can reduce homocysteine-induced neurotoxicity, indicating its potential role in mediating folic acid intake into cells and mitigating homocysteine-related toxicity (Yoshitomi2020Plasma). It is localized in hematopoietic tissues such as the spleen and bone marrow and is present as a secretory protein in humans (Yoshitomi2020Plasma). The protein's expression is negatively correlated with plasma homocysteine levels, suggesting that increasing FOLR3 could ameliorate homocysteine levels and reduce related toxicity (Yoshitomi2020Plasma).

## Clinical Significance
FOLR3 (folate receptor gamma) has been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), FOLR3 shows significant methylation dysregulation, especially in lung squamous carcinoma (LUSC). Hypomethylation of the FOLR3 promoter is notably lower in LUSC tumor tissues compared to normal controls, suggesting its potential role in the pathogenesis of this cancer subtype (Qu2024Blood). This hypomethylation is associated with lower FOLR3 expression levels in both lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and LUSC tissues, which may contribute to tumorigenesis (Qu2024Blood).

FOLR3 is also a target for drugs such as folic acid and EC145, and it interacts with chemicals like o,p′-DDT and polychlorinated biphenyls, which could be relevant for treatment considerations in LUAD and LUSC (Qu2024Blood). Additionally, FOLR3 mutations have been identified in other cancers, such as breast and ovarian carcinoma, although their specific roles in these cancers are not fully detailed (Singh2023Identification).

In colorectal cancer, FOLR3 expression is significantly lower in tumor tissues compared to mucosa, which may influence the metabolism of chemotherapeutic agents like leucovorin (Odin2015Expression).

## Interactions
FOLR3 (folate receptor gamma) is known to interact with several proteins, particularly in the context of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). One of the primary interactions is with the serine protease HTRA1. FOLR3 binds near the active site of HTRA1, potentially inhibiting its proteolytic activity by preventing substrate access. This interaction is significant because HTRA1 is involved in the regulation of transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) signaling by degrading the transforming growth factor receptor 2 (TGFBR2). By inhibiting HTRA1, FOLR3 prevents the degradation of TGFBR2, thereby modulating TGFβ signaling pathways, which are crucial in fibrogenesis (Quinn2022Secreted).

In addition to HTRA1, FOLR3 has been shown to interact with glutaminyl peptide cyclotransferase and midkine, both of which are involved in extracellular matrix metabolism. These interactions were identified through protein-protein interaction studies using immunoprecipitation techniques (Quinn2022Secreted). However, in the context of tongue squamous cell carcinoma, FOLR3 did not show direct physical interactions with other proteins in a protein-protein interaction network analysis, suggesting that its interactions may be context-dependent (Lv2023Signatures).
