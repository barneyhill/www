# KDM5B

## Overview
KDM5B is a gene that encodes the protein lysine demethylase 5B, a member of the Jumonji C (JmjC) family of histone demethylases. This protein plays a pivotal role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression by specifically demethylating di- and tri-methylated lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me2/3), which is typically associated with transcriptional repression (Pavlenko2022Functions; Klein2014The). KDM5B is involved in various cellular processes, including chromatin remodeling, cell cycle regulation, and differentiation, and is essential for maintaining the balance between cell proliferation and differentiation (Han2016Histone; Pavlenko2022Functions). The protein's activity is primarily nuclear, where it interacts with several protein complexes to modulate chromatin structure and gene expression (Klein2014The; Schmitz2011Jarid1b). Alterations in KDM5B expression have been linked to developmental disorders and various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Yoo2022Drawing; Fu2020Targeting).

## Structure
KDM5B, also known as lysine demethylase 5B, is a member of the Jumonji C (JmjC) family of histone demethylases. The protein has a complex molecular structure characterized by several distinct domains. It contains a JmjN/JmjC domain that forms a compact catalytic core essential for its demethylase activity (Pavlenko2022Functions). The protein also includes an ARID domain and three plant homeo domains (PHD1-3), which are involved in chromatin engagement and substrate recognition (Dorosz2019Molecular; Pavlenko2022Functions).

The PHD1 domain specifically recognizes unmodified H3K4, playing a crucial role in the demethylation of H3K4me2/3 (Zhang2014The). The structure of KDM5B is described as dumbbell-shaped and elongated, with a curved α-helical PLU region acting as a rigid linker between the catalytic core and other regions (Dorosz2019Molecular). The protein's secondary structure includes α-helices and β-sheets, with coiled coil motifs and spectrin-like repeats contributing to its architecture (Dorosz2019Molecular).

KDM5B is primarily monomeric in solution, but it may form homo-oligomers or adopt an elongated shape (Dorosz2019Molecular). The protein's interaction with nucleosomes is mediated by its C-terminal region, which shows strong binding with a slow dissociation rate (Dorosz2019Molecular).

## Function
KDM5B, also known as lysine demethylase 5B, is a histone demethylase that plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene transcription and chromatin remodeling in healthy human cells. It specifically demethylates di- and tri-methylated lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me2/3), which is associated with transcriptional repression, as H3K4 methylation is a marker of active chromatin (Pavlenko2022Functions; Klein2014The). KDM5B is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, differentiation, and development. It influences the G1/S transition, reducing terminally differentiated cells and increasing proliferating progenitors (Han2016Histone).

In embryonic stem cells (ESCs), KDM5B is essential for neural differentiation and regulates pluripotency by maintaining H3K4me3 gradients (Han2016Histone; Schmitz2011Jarid1b). It acts as a co-repressor of developmental transcription factors and is involved in balancing cell proliferation and differentiation (Pavlenko2022Functions). KDM5B also plays a role in DNA repair regulation and is involved in chromatin remodeling through its interactions with histone deacetylase complexes, such as the NuRD complex (Pavlenko2022Functions).

KDM5B's activity is primarily nuclear, where it modulates gene expression by altering chromatin structure, impacting processes like stem cell maintenance and differentiation (Klein2014The; Schmitz2011Jarid1b).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the KDM5B gene are implicated in various developmental disorders and cancers. In developmental disorders, KDM5B mutations, including de novo loss-of-function mutations, have been identified in patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID). However, KDM5B haploinsufficiency alone may not fully explain these conditions, suggesting a need for further research into its role (Yoo2022Drawing). Novel splice variants of KDM5B have been associated with developmental delays and behavioral problems, indicating potential clinical significance in ID and ASD (Lebrun2018Novel).

In cancer, KDM5B is frequently overexpressed and is associated with poor prognosis and increased tumor aggressiveness. It is overexpressed in several cancers, including breast, prostate, bladder, lung, and melanoma, where it often promotes proliferation and invasion (Fu2020Targeting; Xhabija2019KDM5B). In breast cancer, KDM5B acts as a transcriptional repressor of tumor suppressor genes, while in melanoma, it is linked to drug resistance and stem cell-like properties (Rasmussen2014The). The overexpression of KDM5B in various cancers suggests its potential as a therapeutic target (Hayami2010Overexpression).

## Interactions
KDM5B, a histone demethylase, interacts with various proteins and complexes, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling. It is known to associate with the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, which includes components such as HDAC1 and CHD4. This interaction suggests a cooperative mechanism involving lysine demethylation, deacetylation, and chromatin remodeling for transcriptional repression (Klein2014The). KDM5B also interacts with the SIN3/HDAC1-containing complexes, indicating its involvement in gene expression regulation (Yheskel2023Proximity).

KDM5B is recruited to specific genomic sites by transcription factors such as PAX9, FOXG1, and LMO2, which function as transcriptional repressors. It also acts as a co-regulator of nuclear receptors like estrogen, androgen, and progesterone receptors (Pavlenko2022Functions). In breast cancer cells, KDM5B shows significant overlap with interactors such as SIN3A, Brd4, MED1, and SUMO2, indicating potential overlapping or redundant functions with other KDM5 paralogs (Yheskel2023Proximity).

KDM5B undergoes post-translational modification through SUMOylation, which is enhanced by its interaction with the Polycomb group protein hPC2, a SUMO E3 ligase. This modification negatively modulates KDM5B's target gene occupancy (Bueno2013SUMOylation).
