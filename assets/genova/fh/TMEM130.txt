# TMEM130

## Overview
TMEM130 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 130, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell signaling and communication across the cell membrane. TMEM130 has been studied for its role in several diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and neurological disorders. Alterations in the expression and methylation of TMEM130 have been linked to gastric cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, and colorectal cancer, suggesting its potential involvement in tumorigenesis and cancer progression (Zhang2021NOVA1Mediated; Zhang2022The; Pradhan2013Systems). Additionally, duplications involving TMEM130 have been associated with intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder, highlighting its significance in neurodevelopmental conditions (Coutton2014ArrayCGH).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
TMEM130 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression and methylation status. In gastric cancer (GC), particularly Epstein-Barr virus-associated gastric cancer (EBVaGC), TMEM130 is often hypermethylated, leading to reduced gene expression. This hypermethylation is associated with decreased transcriptional expression and may contribute to cancer progression by affecting cell migration, suggesting a potential tumor suppressor role (Zhang2022The). 

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), TMEM130 is identified as one of the top hypermethylated genes in both Stage I and Stage III, indicating its potential involvement in the disease's epigenetic landscape (Pradhan2013Systems). 

TMEM130 has also been associated with intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) through duplications in the 7q22.1 region, which includes TMEM130 and the TRRAP gene. These duplications may contribute to the clinical features observed in affected individuals, although the exact correlation remains unclear (Coutton2014ArrayCGH). 

In colorectal cancer (CRC), TMEM130 is involved in alternative splicing events that are differentially expressed between normal and tumor tissues, potentially influencing cancer progression through pathways related to cell division and the Notch signaling pathway (Zhang2021NOVA1Mediated).
