# VANGL1

## Overview
VANGL1 is a gene that encodes the VANGL planar cell polarity protein 1, a transmembrane protein integral to the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway. This protein plays a crucial role in cellular orientation and tissue organization during developmental processes such as gastrulation and neurulation. Characterized by its four-transmembrane domain structure, VANGL1 is involved in protein-protein interactions through its PDZ-binding motif, which is essential for its function in the PCP pathway (Iliescu2011Transmembrane). Mutations in VANGL1 have been linked to neural tube defects (NTDs) and various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Iliescu2014Independent; Hao2020Upregulation). The protein's interactions with other PCP components, such as Dishevelled (Dvl) and Vangl2, underscore its role in maintaining cellular polarity and migration (Torban2004Independent; Belotti2012Molecular).

## Structure
The VANGL1 protein is a transmembrane protein involved in the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, crucial for cellular orientation and tissue organization. It is characterized by a four-transmembrane domain structure, with both the N-terminal and C-terminal regions located intracellularly (Iliescu2011Transmembrane). The transmembrane domains are located in the amino-terminal half of the protein, specifically spanning residues 114-134 (TM1), 152-172 (TM2), 186-206 (TM3), and 222-242 (TM4) (Iliescu2011Transmembrane). 

The C-terminal region of VANGL1 contains a PDZ-binding motif, which is important for interactions with other PCP proteins such as Dishevelled (Dvl) (Iliescu2011Transmembrane; Kibar2009Novel). This region is also involved in intracellular signaling and protein-protein interactions (Hatakeyama2014Vangl1). 

Mutations in VANGL1, such as R181Q and R274Q, have been associated with neural tube defects (NTDs) and are known to impair membrane targeting and protein stability (Iliescu2014Independent). These mutations highlight the importance of the protein's structural integrity for its function in the PCP pathway. The protein's structure and function are conserved across species, underscoring its evolutionary significance (Iliescu2011Transmembrane).

## Function
The VANGL1 gene encodes a protein that is integral to the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, which is crucial for establishing cellular orientation and polarity during development. In healthy human cells, VANGL1 is dynamically expressed in the developing neural tube and plays a significant role in the morphogenetic process of convergent extension during gastrulation and neurulation, which are critical for proper neural tube closure (Kibar2009Novel). The protein is involved in providing planar cell polarity information to epithelial cells, essential for proper tissue patterning during development (Iliescu2014Independent).

VANGL1 is a membrane protein with four transmembrane domains and a PDZ-domain binding motif, which facilitates protein-protein interactions (Kibar2009Novel). It is predominantly expressed in the lateral membrane of polarized cells, where it colocalizes with Na,K-ATPase, indicating its role in membrane targeting (Iliescu2014Independent). The protein is also involved in the export from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane, mediated by specific motifs and interactions with clathrin adaptor complexes (Iliescu2014Independent). Proper function of VANGL1 is critical for normal embryonic development, and mutations in this gene can lead to neural tube defects (NTDs) (Iliescu2014Independent).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the VANGL1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, most notably neural tube defects (NTDs) and certain cancers. In the context of NTDs, VANGL1 mutations, such as missense variants, have been associated with an increased risk of these congenital malformations. These mutations often affect conserved residues and are absent in control groups, suggesting a pathogenic role (Kibar2009Novel; Merello2014Expanding). The gene's interaction with other genetic factors, such as VANGL2, is crucial, as demonstrated in mouse models where combined mutations lead to severe developmental defects (Torban2008Genetic).

In cancer, VANGL1 expression levels have been linked to tumor progression and treatment resistance. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), upregulation of VANGL1 is associated with increased cell viability and radioresistance, potentially through interactions with the BRAF/TP53BP1/RAD51 pathway, which aids in DNA repair (Hao2020Upregulation). In breast cancer, elevated VANGL1 expression correlates with a higher risk of tumor recurrence and reduced survival in estrogen receptor-positive patients, indicating its role in cancer progression may vary depending on the cancer subtype (Hatakeyama2014Vangl1).

## Interactions
VANGL1, a key component of the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, interacts with several proteins to regulate cell polarity and migration. It forms a complex with SCRIB and NOS1AP, which is crucial for cell migration and polarity in breast cancer cells. In normal mammary cells, SCRIB and VANGL1 localize to cell junctions, while NOS1AP is primarily in the cytosol. In breast cancer cells, reducing NOS1AP levels mimics the effects of reducing SCRIB, leading to decreased cell motility, indicating that these proteins work together to regulate cell migration (Anastas2011A).

VANGL1 also interacts with Vangl2, forming both homodimers and heterodimers. This interaction is facilitated through their transmembrane domains, and Vangl2 can compensate for the loss of Vangl1 in certain genetic contexts (Belotti2012Molecular). The interaction between VANGL1 and Vangl2 is specific and occurs at the plasma membrane, as confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Belotti2012Molecular).

Additionally, VANGL1 interacts with Dishevelled (Dvl) proteins through its PDZ-binding motif, which is significant for recruiting Dvl to the plasma membrane in response to PCP signaling (Torban2004Independent). These interactions highlight VANGL1's role in cellular orientation and tissue organization.
