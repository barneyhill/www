# NPHP3

## Overview
The NPHP3 gene encodes the protein nephrocystin 3, which is integral to the function and organization of primary cilia, cellular structures that play a critical role in signaling and sensory perception. Nephrocystin 3 is characterized by its structural domains, including coiled-coil domains and tetratricopeptide repeats, which facilitate protein-protein interactions essential for its ciliary localization and function (Nakata2012Targeting). The protein is involved in the trafficking of proteins to the primary cilium, a process vital for maintaining ciliary integrity and function (Nakata2012Targeting). Nephrocystin 3 interacts with various proteins, such as UNC119 and ANKS6, forming complexes that are crucial for renal and cardiovascular development (Hoff2013ANKS6; Wright2011An). Mutations in the NPHP3 gene are linked to ciliopathies, including nephronophthisis and Meckel-Gruber syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in human health (Tory2009Mutations; Bergmann2008Loss).

## Structure
The NPHP3 protein, encoded by the NPHP3 gene, is a 140 kDa protein consisting of 1325 amino acids. It features several structural domains, including three coiled-coil (CC) domains and eight tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs), which are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions (Nakata2012Targeting). The N-terminal region of NPHP3, particularly the first 201 amino acids, is crucial for its localization to primary cilia and contains a ciliary targeting signal (CTS) (Nakata2012Targeting). This region includes two coiled-coil domains, CC1 (amino acids 112-146) and CC2 (amino acids 172-199), which are necessary for localization to the base of primary cilia (Nakata2012Targeting).

A significant post-translational modification of NPHP3 is myristoylation at the N-terminal glycine, which is essential for its trafficking to the ciliary shaft (Nakata2012Targeting). Mutation of this myristoylation site disrupts ciliary localization, highlighting its importance (Nakata2012Targeting). The protein also contains VxP motifs, although these do not function as ciliary targeting sequences (Nakata2012Targeting). The interaction with UNC119, a myristoyl-binding protein, is crucial for the proper ciliary targeting of NPHP3, as part of the ARL3-UNC119-RP2 GTPase cycle (Wright2011An).

## Function
The NPHP3 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the organization and function of primary cilia, which are essential for cellular signaling and sensory perception. NPHP3 is involved in the localization and trafficking of proteins to the primary cilium, a process crucial for maintaining ciliary function and structure. The protein contains an N-terminal myristoylation site and coiled-coil (CC) domains, which are essential for its proper localization to the ciliary membrane and basal body (Nakata2012Targeting). Myristoylation, a post-translational modification, facilitates the membrane binding and ciliary shaft entry of NPHP3, while the CC domains target the basal body, acting as a basal body targeting signal (Nakata2012Targeting).

NPHP3 interacts with other nephronophthisis proteins and is implicated in both canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling pathways, although the exact molecular mechanisms remain partially understood (Wright2011An). The ARL3-UNC119-RP2 GTPase cycle is crucial for the proper targeting of myristoylated NPHP3 to the ciliary membrane, highlighting its role in ciliary processes (Wright2011An). Disruption in the function or localization of NPHP3 can lead to ciliopathies, such as nephronophthisis, characterized by symptoms like cystic kidneys and retinal degeneration (Wright2011An).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NPHP3 gene are associated with a range of ciliopathies, including nephronophthisis, Meckel-Gruber syndrome, and renal-hepatic-pancreatic dysplasia. Nephronophthisis, a kidney disorder characterized by cystic kidney disease, can manifest in both infantile and adolescent forms, with the age of onset for end-stage renal disease varying widely. This variability is influenced by the type of NPHP3 mutation, such as truncating or splice site mutations, which are linked to more severe phenotypes like infantile nephronophthisis or multicystic dysplastic kidneys (Tory2009Mutations; Abdullah2017Homozygous).

Complete loss of NPHP3 function can lead to severe conditions such as situs inversus, congenital heart defects, and embryonic lethality. In humans, NPHP3 mutations are associated with early embryonic patterning defects, including situs inversus, polydactyly, central nervous system malformations, and congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (Bergmann2008Loss). The gene's role in ciliary function is crucial, as its mutations can disrupt normal cilia-related processes, leading to the observed phenotypic variability and systemic manifestations (Shiba2010Inv; Bergmann2008Loss).

## Interactions
NPHP3 (nephrocystin 3) is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its function in ciliary processes. It interacts with the Inv protein, which acts as a molecular anchor for NPHP3 and NEK8 within the primary cilia's Inv compartment. This interaction is essential for the proper localization of NPHP3 and NEK8 to the Inv compartment, although NPHP3 can localize to primary cilia without Inv, albeit less stably (Shiba2010Inv).

NPHP3 also interacts with UNC119, a myristoyl-binding protein, which is crucial for its ciliary localization. The interaction requires myristoylation of NPHP3, and the ARL3-UNC119-RP2 GTPase cycle facilitates the targeting of myristoylated NPHP3 to the ciliary membrane (Wright2011An). UNC119b, in particular, is essential for the proper ciliary localization of NPHP3, while UNC119a does not affect its localization (Wright2011An).

Additionally, NPHP3 is part of a nephronophthisis module involving interactions with ANKS6, NEK8, and INVS. ANKS6 serves as a central component linking these proteins, and its interaction with NPHP3 is crucial for normal renal and cardiovascular development (Hoff2013ANKS6). NME3, another interacting partner, links NPHP3 with other nephronophthisis proteins, suggesting a role in stabilizing these interactions (Hoff2018The).
