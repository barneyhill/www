# KRTAP10-6

## Overview
KRTAP10-6 is a gene that encodes the keratin-associated protein 10-6, a member of the keratin-associated protein (KRTAP) family. This family of proteins is integral to the structure and function of hair, particularly in the formation and integrity of hair fibers. The KRTAP10-6 gene is specifically expressed in the hair fiber cuticle, indicating its specialized role in hair-related tissues. The protein interacts with keratin to influence hair characteristics such as thickness and curliness. The evolutionary presence of KRTAP10-6 in organisms as ancient as the sea anemone suggests its longstanding role in hair follicle development and highlights its significance in the evolutionary history of hair structure (Litman2023Ancient).

## Function
KRTAP10-6 is a member of the keratin-associated protein (KRTAP) family, which plays a significant role in the structure and function of hair. In humans, KRTAP10-6 is specifically expressed in the hair fiber cuticle, approximately 20 cell layers above the apex of the dermal papilla of the hair root, and is not detected in other tissues. This suggests a specialized role in hair structure or function, contributing to the formation and integrity of hair fibers (Litman2023Ancient).

The KRTAP10 family, to which KRTAP10-6 belongs, is part of the M lineage of KRTAP genes, which are primarily expressed in hair-related tissues. These proteins interact with keratin to form hair fibers, determining characteristics such as thickness and curliness (Litman2023Ancient). The evolutionary presence of KRTAP10-6 in species as early as the sea anemone indicates its ancient origins and potential evolutionary roles in hair follicle development (Litman2023Ancient). The specific expression pattern and evolutionary history of KRTAP10-6 highlight its importance in the molecular processes that underpin hair structure and function.
