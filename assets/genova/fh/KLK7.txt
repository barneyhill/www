# KLK7

## Overview
KLK7, or kallikrein-related peptidase 7, is a gene that encodes a serine protease enzyme involved in various physiological processes, particularly in the skin. The protein product of KLK7, kallikrein-related peptidase 7, is primarily active in the stratum corneum of the epidermis, where it plays a critical role in skin desquamation by degrading corneodesmosome proteins, thus facilitating the shedding of corneocytes (Kishibe2019Physiological; Caubet2004Degradation). Beyond its role in skin physiology, KLK7 is implicated in antimicrobial defense and is involved in the activation of antimicrobial peptides, contributing to innate immunity (Lundwall2008Kallikreinrelated). Dysregulation of KLK7 activity is associated with various skin disorders and diseases, including cancer and Alzheimer's disease, where it serves as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target due to its altered expression and interactions with other proteins (Walker2014Kallikreinrelated; Kidana2018Loss; Gong2020Prognostic).

## Structure
KLK7, also known as kallikrein-related peptidase 7, is a serine protease with a well-defined molecular structure. The primary structure of KLK7 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain, which begins with Ile 16 and ends with Arg 246 (Debela2007Chymotryptic). The secondary structure includes two six-stranded β-barrels, a 3_10-helix, and two α-helices (Debela2007Chymotryptic). The tertiary structure is characterized by an oblate ellipsoid shape, stabilized by six intramolecular disulfide bridges (Debela2007Chymotryptic).

KLK7's active site contains a catalytic triad composed of Ser195, His57, and Asp102, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Hanke2020Structural). The enzyme features a unique S1 specificity pocket that is larger and more hydrophobic than those of other kallikreins, accommodating medium to large side chains with polar tips, such as tyrosine (Debela2008Structures; Debela2007Chymotryptic). The S1 pocket's distinctiveness is due to the presence of Asn189 instead of the more common Asp189 (Hanke2020Structural).

KLK7 is synthesized as an inactive precursor and activated by extracellular proteases (Debela2007Chymotryptic). It may undergo post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, and can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing (Silva2017Mass). The enzyme's structure and specificity are crucial for its role in physiological processes and its involvement in various diseases.

## Function
KLK7, or kallikrein-related peptidase 7, is a serine protease primarily active in the stratum corneum of the epidermis, where it plays a crucial role in skin desquamation. It facilitates the shedding of corneocytes by degrading corneodesmosome proteins such as corneodesmosin (CDSN) and desmocollin 1 (DSC1), which are essential for maintaining skin barrier integrity (Kishibe2019Physiological; Caubet2004Degradation). KLK7 is activated by a trypsin-like protease, potentially KLK5, and its activity is regulated by the acidic environment of the stratum corneum, which is conducive to its function (Caubet2004Degradation).

In addition to its role in desquamation, KLK7 is involved in the skin's antimicrobial defense. It processes the inactive proform of cathelicidin antimicrobial peptides into the active peptide LL-37, contributing to innate immunity (Lundwall2008Kallikreinrelated; Kishibe2019Physiological). The activity of KLK7 is modulated by endogenous inhibitors such as LEKTI, which prevent excessive proteolysis and maintain skin homeostasis (Deraison2007LEKTI). Dysregulation of KLK7 activity can lead to skin disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining epidermal health (Deraison2007LEKTI).

## Clinical Significance
KLK7 (kallikrein-related peptidase 7) has significant clinical implications in various diseases due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), elevated KLK7 mRNA expression is associated with poor progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). It acts as an independent prognostic biomarker, indicating a worse prognosis when overexpressed (Gong2020Prognostic). KLK7 is also linked to chemoresistance in ovarian cancer, further complicating treatment outcomes (Gong2020Prognostic).

In Alzheimer's disease, KLK7 plays a role in amyloid-beta (Ab) metabolism. Its decreased expression in the brain correlates with increased amyloid deposition, suggesting that KLK7 is crucial for Ab degradation. The loss of KLK7 exacerbates amyloid pathology, indicating its potential role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (Kidana2018Loss).

In colon cancer, KLK7 is overexpressed and associated with increased cell proliferation and tumor growth. It is considered a proliferative factor and potential therapeutic target due to its role in cancer progression (Walker2014Kallikreinrelated). KLK7's expression in colon cancer is linked to poor prognosis, highlighting its significance in tumorigenesis (Walker2014Kallikreinrelated).

## Interactions
KLK7, a serine protease, is involved in various interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in processes such as skin desquamation and cancer progression. In the context of skin desquamation, KLK7 interacts with corneodesmosome proteins, including corneodesmosin (CDSN) and desmocollin 1 (DSC1), facilitating their degradation at the acidic pH of the stratum corneum. This activity is crucial for the shedding of corneocytes, a process regulated by protease inhibitors like secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) and elafin, which modulate KLK7's activity (Caubet2004Degradation).

KLK7 also interacts with LEKTI fragments, which inhibit its proteolytic activity. LEKTI fragments, particularly D8-D11, exhibit a pH-dependent inhibitory effect on KLK7, with the highest inhibition observed at neutral pH. This interaction is essential for controlling desquamation and maintaining skin barrier function (Deraison2007LEKTI).

In ovarian cancer, KLK7 is involved in activating protease cascades, interacting with substrates such as matrix metalloprotease 2 (MMP2) and insulin growth factor binding proteins (IGFBP3 and IGFBP6). These interactions suggest KLK7's role in extracellular matrix remodeling and metastasis (Silva2019Integration).
