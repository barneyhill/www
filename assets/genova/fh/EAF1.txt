# EAF1

## Overview
EAF1 (ELL associated factor 1) is a gene that encodes a nuclear protein involved in transcriptional regulation, primarily functioning as a cofactor for RNA polymerase II elongation factor ELL. The EAF1 protein enhances transcriptional elongation and acts as a transcriptional repressor, notably for the Wnt4 gene, by binding to its promoter and inhibiting its expression. This regulatory role is crucial for maintaining appropriate gene expression levels and cellular functions. EAF1 is also a component of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex, where it plays a significant role in chromatin structure modification, transcription, DNA repair, and chromosome stability. The protein's interactions within the NuA4 complex underscore its importance in maintaining complex integrity and function. Mutations or alterations in EAF1 expression have been linked to various diseases, including cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Wan2010Negative; Wang2018Architecture; Mitchell2008Functional).

## Function
EAF1 (ELL associated factor 1) is a nuclear protein involved in transcriptional regulation, primarily functioning as a cofactor for RNA polymerase II elongation factor ELL, enhancing transcriptional elongation. In healthy human cells, EAF1 plays a role in modulating gene expression, impacting cell growth and differentiation. It acts as a transcriptional repressor for Wnt4, a gene involved in various signaling pathways, by binding directly to its promoter and inhibiting its expression. This interaction suggests a regulatory feedback loop between EAF1 and Wnt4, which is crucial for maintaining appropriate expression levels (Wan2010Negative).

EAF1 is also a component of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex, which is involved in histone acetylation, a key process in gene regulation. Within this complex, EAF1 is essential for maintaining its integrity and function, as it interacts with other subunits to facilitate processes such as chromatin structure modification, transcription, DNA repair, and chromosome stability (Mitchell2008Functional). The role of EAF1 in these molecular processes underscores its importance in cellular functions and organismal outcomes, although its specific function in human cells is inferred from studies in model organisms like yeast.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the EAF1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. EAF1 is a component of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex, which plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, and chromatin remodeling. Disruptions in EAF1 can lead to the collapse of the NuA4 complex, affecting its ability to maintain chromatin structure and regulate gene expression, potentially contributing to tumorigenesis (Mitchell2008Functional).

EAF1 is also involved in the regulation of stress response pathways and protein transport, and its dysfunction may contribute to complex genetic diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancers such as prostate cancer (Mitchell2008Functional). The gene's role as a genetic hub suggests that mutations in EAF1 could modify the effects of other mutations, thereby influencing the development and progression of these diseases (Mitchell2008Functional).

In zebrafish, EAF1, along with EAF2, is involved in erythropoiesis and hypoxia tolerance, with implications for understanding similar processes in humans. Disruption of EAF1/2 affects the expression of key transcriptional regulators and signaling pathways, which may be relevant to conditions like leukemia and prostate cancer (Liu2023Zebrafish).

## Interactions
EAF1 is a key scaffolding subunit within the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex, where it interacts with several proteins to maintain complex integrity. The Eaf1 protein's SANT domain directly binds to the Tra1 subunit through intermolecular hydrogen and ionic bonds, involving specific charged residues. This interaction stabilizes Eaf1's binding to Tra1, which serves as a scaffold for the NuA4 and SAGA complexes (Wang2018Architecture). Eaf1 also interacts with Eaf5, anchoring the dissociable Eaf5/7/3 module to the NuA4 complex. Eaf5 makes extensive contacts with the Tra1 FAT domain, providing elasticity for dynamic assembly into the NuA4 complex (Wang2018Architecture).

The Eaf1 HSA domain is crucial for associating with the piccolo NuA4 and SWR1-C modules, binding to Arp4 and Act1 via hydrophobic interactions. Key hydrophobic residues of Eaf1 HSA interact with residues in Arp4 and Act1, which are essential for the assembly and recruitment of the NuA4 complex to DNA (Wang2018Architecture). Eaf1's interactions are primarily within the NuA4 complex, as it copurifies only with NuA4 subunits and Fks1, indicating its role in maintaining complex integrity (Mitchell2008Functional).
