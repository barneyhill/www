# KRTAP2-2

## Overview
KRTAP2-2 is a gene that encodes the keratin-associated protein 2-2, a member of the KAP2 family, which is integral to the structural composition of hair and nails. This protein is characterized by its high sulfur content, particularly cysteine, which is crucial for the formation of disulfide bonds that confer mechanical strength and resilience to hair fibers. The keratin-associated protein 2-2 interacts with keratin intermediate filaments within the hair follicle, playing a significant role in determining hair texture and quality. Despite its critical function in hair structure, the gene's specific role in healthy human cells is not fully understood, partly due to its low transcription levels and high sequence homology with other keratin-associated proteins (Rogers2006Human; Siddiqui2018Chromosome).

## Function
KRTAP2-2 encodes keratin-associated protein 2-2, which plays a crucial role in the structure and formation of hair and nails. This protein is part of the KAP2 family, characterized by high sulfur content, particularly cysteine, which ranges from 27.3-28.1 mol %. These proteins are approximately 13.5 kDa in size and are smaller than those in the KAP1 family. KRTAP2-2, like other KAP2 proteins, contains several dimeric cysteine-containing pentameric repeat structures, with serine, threonine, proline, or valine often found in positions 4-5 of these pentamers (Rogers2006Human).

KRTAP2-2 is primarily active in the hair follicle, where it interacts with keratin intermediate filaments. This interaction contributes to the mechanical strength and resilience of hair fibers, influencing hair texture and quality. The protein's high sulfur content, particularly cysteine, is essential for forming disulfide bonds, which provide structural integrity to hair and nails (Rogers2006Human). Despite its importance in hair structure, the specific function of KRTAP2-2 in healthy human cells remains less well-defined, with challenges in its detection due to low transcription levels and high sequence homology with other keratin-associated proteins (Siddiqui2018Chromosome).
