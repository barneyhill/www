# SAT1

## Overview
The SAT1 gene encodes the enzyme spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase 1, a key player in polyamine metabolism. This enzyme is classified as an acetyltransferase and is responsible for the acetylation of polyamines such as spermidine and spermine, which is crucial for maintaining cellular polyamine homeostasis (Ou2016Activation; Pegg2009Mammalian). The regulation of polyamine levels by SAT1 is essential for various cellular processes, including growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (Mou2022Abundant). SAT1 activity is typically low in normal conditions but can be upregulated in response to stress and other stimuli, playing a protective role against oxidative stress and nutrient deprivation (Klempan2009Profiling). Additionally, SAT1 is involved in the regulation of ion channels and neurotransmission pathways, impacting neuroprotection and membrane fluidity (Klempan2009Profiling). The enzyme's activity is primarily cytoplasmic, contributing to DNA stabilization and cellular ion channel regulation (Liang2021Novel).

## Function
The SAT1 gene encodes the enzyme spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase 1, which plays a crucial role in polyamine metabolism by catalyzing the acetylation of spermidine and spermine. This enzymatic activity is essential for maintaining polyamine homeostasis within cells, as it facilitates the conversion of these polyamines into acetylated forms that can be either exported from the cell or further degraded into putrescine (Ou2016Activation; Pegg2009Mammalian). The regulation of polyamine levels is vital for normal cellular functions, including growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (Mou2022Abundant).

In healthy human cells, SAT1 activity is typically low but can be induced by various stimuli such as stress, cytokines, and drugs (Mou2022Abundant). The enzyme is involved in the polyamine stress response, which helps protect cells against oxidative stress and nutrient deprivation (Klempan2009Profiling). SAT1 also plays a role in regulating ion channels and is linked to neurotransmission pathways, influencing processes like neuroprotection and membrane fluidity (Klempan2009Profiling). The enzyme's activity occurs in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to cellular functions such as DNA stabilization and ion channel regulation (Liang2021Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SAT1 gene, which encodes the enzyme spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase 1, have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. High SAT1 expression is associated with poor prognosis in low-grade glioma (LGG), correlating with shorter overall survival and progression-free intervals. It is also linked to immune cell infiltration, particularly involving macrophages and CD8+ T cells, and is involved in resistance to the chemotherapy drug temozolomide (Mou2022Abundant).

In psychiatric conditions, decreased SAT1 expression has been observed in the brains of individuals who have completed suicide, suggesting a role in the neurobiology of suicidal behavior. This reduction in expression is associated with specific SAT1 promoter variants (Fiori2011Global).

SAT1 is also involved in the regulation of ferroptosis, a form of cell death. Its overexpression can lead to ferroptosis in the presence of reactive oxygen species, indicating a potential tumor-suppressive role. This is particularly relevant in the context of p53-mediated responses, where SAT1 is a transcriptional target of p53, contributing to ferroptotic cell death (Ou2016Activation).

In melanoma, the knockdown of an alternative splicing variant of SAT1, known as SSATX, promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting a tumor-suppressive function for this variant (Yang2019Knockdown).
