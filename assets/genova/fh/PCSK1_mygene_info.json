regulated or constitutive branches of the secretory pathway. The encoded protein undergoes an initial autocatalytic processing event in the ER to generate a heterodimer which exits the ER and sorts to subcellular compartments where a second autocatalytic even takes place and the catalytic activity is acquired. The protease is packaged into and activated in dense core secretory granules and expressed in the neuroendocrine system and brain. This gene encodes one of the seven basic amino acid-specific members which cleave their substrates at single or paired basic residues. It functions in the proteolytic activation of polypeptide hormones and neuropeptides precursors. Mutations in this gene have been associated with susceptibility to obesity and proprotein convertase 1/3 deficiency. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2014].", "symbol": "PCSK1", "taxid": 9606, "type_of_gene": "protein-coding", "umls": {"cui": "C1418388"}, "unigene": "Hs.78977", "uniprot": {"Swiss-Prot": "P29120", "TrEMBL": "D6RJA3"}, "wikipedia": {"url_stub": "Proprotein convertase 1"}}
