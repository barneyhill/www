# PDCD6

## Overview
PDCD6, also known as programmed cell death 6, is a gene that encodes a calcium-binding protein characterized by the presence of EF-hand motifs. These motifs are helix-loop-helix structural domains that facilitate calcium ion binding, which is crucial for the protein's function in various cellular processes, including apoptosis, angiogenesis, and membrane repair (Wang2020PDCD6; Rho2012Programmed). The protein, also referred to as ALG-2, is involved in regulating cell growth and apoptosis, maintaining cellular homeostasis, and participating in signaling pathways such as PI3K/mTOR/p70S6K and MAPK (Wang2020PDCD6; Rho2012Programmed). PDCD6's interactions with other proteins, such as death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPk1) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2), underscore its role in apoptosis and angiogenesis (Rho2012Programmed; Lee2005Programmed). The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to various cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Yoon2011Programmed; Wang2020PDCD6).

## Structure
PDCD6, also known as programmed cell death 6, encodes a calcium-binding protein characterized by the presence of EF-hand motifs, which are helix-loop-helix structural domains that facilitate calcium ion binding (Wang2020PDCD6; Rho2012Programmed). The protein contains five EF-hand motifs, which are crucial for its ability to undergo conformational changes upon calcium binding, allowing it to interact with various intracellular protein partners (Wang2020PDCD6; Rho2012Programmed). These interactions are essential for its role in apoptosis and other cellular processes.

The primary structure of PDCD6 includes an open reading frame encoding 191 amino acids (Rho2012Programmed). The secondary structure is defined by the EF-hand motifs, which contribute to the protein's ability to bind calcium ions. Upon calcium binding, PDCD6 undergoes structural changes that expose hydrophobic regions, facilitating interactions with other proteins (Wang2018Molecular).

PDCD6 can form homodimers, which are important for its functional interactions and structural stability (Rho2012Programmed). Post-translational modifications, such as methylation, occur at specific amino acids, including K90, which is crucial for its function in preventing apoptosis and promoting cell growth under stress conditions (Luo2022MAT2A). These modifications influence PDCD6's stability and interactions, particularly under conditions like glucose deprivation in cancer cells.

## Function
PDCD6, also known as programmed cell death 6, is a calcium-binding protein involved in various cellular processes, including apoptosis, angiogenesis, and membrane repair. In healthy human cells, PDCD6 plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance between cell growth and apoptosis, which is essential for normal cellular function and preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation (Rho2012Programmed).

PDCD6 is involved in the regulation of angiogenesis by interacting with the PI3K/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway through VEGFR-2. It inhibits VEGF-induced endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and invasion, acting as an angiostatic agent (Rho2012Programmed). This function is critical in controlling angiogenic processes, which are important for tissue growth and repair (Rho2012Programmed).

In the context of muscle cell repair, PDCD6 interacts with dysferlin and annexin proteins, participating in a calcium-dependent mechanism that is crucial for membrane repair. This interaction is part of a complex involving calcium signaling, which is necessary for the release and binding of PDCD6 to its interacting proteins, facilitating membrane repair processes (Drescher2023Analysis).

PDCD6 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival through its interactions with various proteins and signaling pathways (Drescher2023Analysis).

## Clinical Significance
PDCD6, also known as programmed cell death 6, has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression and interactions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), PDCD6 is overexpressed, promoting tumor growth and progression through the activation of the MAPK signaling pathway via its interaction with c-Raf. This interaction is calcium-dependent and leads to the phosphorylation of c-Raf, enhancing the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation and survival. High PDCD6 expression in CRC is associated with advanced tumor stages and poor prognosis, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Wang2020PDCD6).

In gastric cancer, PDCD6 is overexpressed in a significant number of cases and is linked to overall survival. A specific mutation, TGG (Trp) → TAG (stop) at codon 175, was identified, indicating a somatic mutation that affects its function. Wild-type PDCD6 reduces cell viability and increases apoptosis, suggesting a role in the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway (Yoon2011Programmed).

PDCD6 polymorphisms have also been studied in relation to oral and lung cancer risks. The GG genotype of rs4957014 is associated with a decreased risk of these cancers, particularly among smokers, highlighting the gene's potential role in cancer susceptibility and personalized therapy (Shen2019&lt; p&gt; SHIH2022The; Contribution).

## Interactions
PDCD6, also known as ALG-2, is a calcium-binding protein that participates in various protein interactions, influencing multiple cellular processes. It interacts with death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPk1), enhancing its pro-apoptotic function by increasing caspase-3 activity, which is crucial for apoptosis (Lee2005Programmed). PDCD6 also interacts with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2), inhibiting angiogenesis by suppressing VEGFR-2 expression and affecting the PI3K/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway (Rho2012Programmed).

In colorectal cancer, PDCD6 interacts with c-Raf, a key component of the MAPK signaling pathway, promoting tumor growth through the activation of the c-Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. This interaction is calcium-dependent, as PDCD6 undergoes a conformational change upon binding to Ca2+, facilitating its interaction with c-Raf (Wang2020PDCD6).

PDCD6 is also involved in cell membrane repair and muscle preservation, interacting with proteins such as dysferlin, annexin A2, and FKBP8. These interactions are crucial for muscle repair and are influenced by calcium levels, which affect the binding dynamics of PDCD6 with its partners (Drescher2023Analysis).
