# OR2V2

## Overview
The OR2V2 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily V member 2, which is part of the olfactory receptor family. This family of proteins is categorized as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are integral membrane proteins involved in the detection of odor molecules. The OR2V2 gene is located on chromosome 7 and is one of many genes that contribute to the diversity of olfactory receptors, enabling the detection of a wide range of odorants. The protein encoded by OR2V2 plays a crucial role in the olfactory system by binding specific odorant molecules and initiating a signal transduction pathway that ultimately results in the perception of smell (Qiu2020aarFDC).
