# RGS9

## Overview
The RGS9 gene encodes the regulator of G protein signaling 9 (RGS9), a critical component of the R7 subfamily of RGS proteins, which are involved in the modulation of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways. RGS9 is a modular protein characterized by multiple domains, including the RGS homology domain, which enhances the GTPase activity of G protein alpha-subunits, thereby accelerating signal termination. The gene produces two main splice isoforms, RGS9-1 and RGS9-2, which are differentially expressed in the retina and the striatum, respectively, and serve distinct physiological roles. RGS9-1 is essential for the rapid deactivation of phototransduction in retinal photoreceptors, while RGS9-2 modulates dopamine and opioid receptor signaling in the brain, influencing motor control and reward-related behaviors (Martemyanov2009Chapter; Anderson2009The). The functional diversity of RGS9 isoforms underscores its significance in both visual and neurological processes, with implications for disorders such as bradyopsia, Parkinson's disease, and opioid addiction (Martemyanov2009Chapter; Gold2007RGS9–2).

## Structure
The RGS9 protein is a member of the R7 subfamily of regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins, which includes RGS6, RGS7, and RGS11. It is a modular multidomain protein with five distinct domains. The catalytic RGS homology domain interacts with G protein alpha-subunits to stimulate their GTPase activity. Upstream of this domain is the G protein gamma-subunit like domain (GGL), which is structurally homologous to conventional G protein gamma-subunits. The two N-terminal domains are the DEP (Disheveled, Egl-10, Pleckstrin) domain and the R7H (R7 Homology) domain, also known as DHEX (DEP helical extension). The DEP domain is found in over 30 unrelated signaling molecules, while the R7H domain is unique to R7 RGS proteins (Martemyanov2009Chapter).

RGS9 exists in two splice isoforms, RGS9-1 and RGS9-2, which differ at their C-termini. RGS9-1 is a 481 residue polypeptide found in the retina, while RGS9-2 is a 671 amino acid protein enriched in the striatum of the central nervous system. The isoforms differ at their C-termini, with RGS9-1 having an 18 amino acid stretch replaced by a 209 amino acid-long domain in RGS9-2 (Martemyanov2009Chapter; Rahman1999Cloning).

The quaternary structure of RGS9 involves its interaction with the type 5 G protein beta subunit (Gb5), forming a specific coiled-coil interaction through its GGL domain. RGS9-1 binds to the long splice isoform of Gb5, Gb5L, and associates with the RGS9 anchor protein (R9AP) in photoreceptors, while RGS9-2 binds to the short splice isoform of Gb5, Gb5S, and interacts with the R7 binding protein (R7BP) in the striatum (Martemyanov2009Chapter).

## Function
The RGS9 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in modulating G protein signaling pathways in specific tissues. It exists in two isoforms, RGS9-1 and RGS9-2, which have distinct functions in different tissues. RGS9-1 is primarily found in the retina, where it is essential for the rapid termination of photoreceptor responses to light. It acts as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) in the phototransduction cascade, facilitating the inactivation of the G protein transducin, which is crucial for the high temporal resolution of vision (Anderson2009The; Cowan2000RGS). The absence of RGS9-1 function can lead to bradyopsia, a visual disorder characterized by slow vision (Martemyanov2009Chapter).

RGS9-2 is predominantly expressed in the striatum, a brain region associated with reward processing and motor coordination. It functions as a negative regulator of G protein-mediated signals, particularly those triggered by dopamine and opioid receptors. This isoform modulates signaling pathways associated with reward and nociception, influencing motor control and reward-related behaviors (Martemyanov2009Chapter; Anderson2009The). RGS9-2's role in these pathways is supported by its physical association with these receptors and its ability to modulate signaling intensity through feedback mechanisms (Anderson2009The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the RGS9 gene have been implicated in several neurological conditions. RGS9-2, a splice variant of RGS9, plays a critical role in modulating dopamine signaling pathways, particularly those involving D2 dopamine receptors. Alterations in RGS9-2 expression can lead to dyskinesias, characterized by involuntary movements, as seen in experimental models of Parkinson's disease and in RGS9 knock-out mice (Gold2007RGS9–2; Kovoor2005D2Dopamine). In Parkinson's disease, overexpression of RGS9-2 has been shown to reduce L-dopa-induced dyskinesia without affecting the therapeutic effects of L-dopa, suggesting its potential as a target for managing dyskinesia (Gold2007RGS9–2).

RGS9-2 is also involved in opioid receptor signaling, influencing morphine sensitivity, tolerance, and dependence. Deletion of the RGS9 gene in mice results in increased sensitivity to morphine's rewarding effects and slower development of tolerance, indicating that RGS9-2 modulates opioid receptor signaling and could be a target for treating opiate addiction (Zachariou2003Essential).

Additionally, genetic variations in RGS9 have been associated with tardive dyskinesia in patients with schizophrenia undergoing long-term antipsychotic treatment. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms in the RGS9 gene may contribute to the risk of developing this condition (Liou2008Analysis).

## Interactions
RGS9 interacts with several proteins, forming complexes that are crucial for its function in signal transduction. RGS9 forms a stable complex with the G protein subunit Gβ5, which is essential for its stability and proper folding. This interaction is mediated by the GGL domain of RGS9, which resembles conventional G protein βγ-subunit interactions (Martemyanov2009Chapter; Anderson2009The). RGS9 also interacts with membrane anchors such as R9AP in photoreceptors and R7BP in the striatum, which are necessary for its membrane association and stability (Martemyanov2009Chapter; Anderson2009The).

RGS9-2, a splice variant of RGS9, interacts with the μ-opioid receptor and D2 dopamine receptors, playing a role in modulating signaling pathways related to reward and nociception (Anderson2009The). It also associates with proteins like β-arrestin, GRK2, and the GPCR scaffold spinophilin, which may influence receptor internalization and tolerance development (Anderson2009The). In the context of visual signal transduction, RGS9-1 interacts with transducin and PDEγ, facilitating the rapid inactivation of the G protein transducin, which is essential for the high temporal resolution of vision (AbramowNewerly2006RGS; Anderson2009The).
