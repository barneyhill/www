# ATP1A4

## Overview
The ATP1A4 gene encodes the ATPase Na+/K+ transporting subunit alpha 4, a transmembrane protein that is a critical component of the Na,K-ATPase enzyme complex. This protein is primarily expressed in the testes and plays a pivotal role in sperm motility and fertility by maintaining the electrochemical gradients of sodium and potassium ions across the plasma membrane (Rajamanickam2019TestisSpecific; Hlivko2005The). The ATP1A4 protein is part of a heteromeric complex that includes alpha, beta, and gamma subunits, and it is characterized by multiple transmembrane domains that facilitate ion transport (Keryanov2002Physical). Beyond its enzymatic function, ATP1A4 is involved in various protein interactions that are essential for sperm capacitation and fertilization, highlighting its dual role as both an ion transporter and a signaling molecule (Rajamanickam2019TestisSpecific). Alterations in ATP1A4 expression or function have been linked to male infertility, neurological disorders, and certain cancers, underscoring its clinical significance (Syeda2020The; Palumbo2019Familial; Huang2020Comprehensive).

## Structure
The ATP1A4 gene encodes a Na,K-ATPase isoform, which is a membrane-associated enzyme responsible for the active transport of sodium and potassium ions across cell membranes. The ATP1A4 protein is composed of 1029 amino acids and is characterized by a predicted polypeptide that shares significant identity with other isoforms, such as ATP1A2 (82%) and ATP1A1 (79.8%) (Keryanov2002Physical). The protein structure includes several conserved domains: a cation ATPase transporter domain, an E1-E2 ATPase domain associated with phosphorylation sites, a haloacid dehalogenase-like hydrolase domain, and a cation transporting ATPase domain (Keryanov2002Physical).

The ATP1A4 protein is part of a heteromeric complex composed of equimolar amounts of alpha and beta subunits, and a gamma subunit, forming its quaternary structure (Keryanov2002Physical). The alpha subunit, which ATP1A4 is a part of, is a transmembrane protein with ten transmembrane domains that provide a pore for cation transport (Keryanov2002Physical). The N-terminus of the protein shows significant sequence diversity and contains lysine residues important for the deocclusion of potassium (Keryanov2002Physical). The protein's activity is regulated by intracellular messengers such as kinases and by alternative splicing (Keryanov2002Physical).

## Function
The ATP1A4 gene encodes the Na,K-ATPase alpha4 isoform, which is specifically expressed in human sperm and plays a crucial role in sperm motility and fertility. This isoform is localized to the principal piece of the sperm flagellum, where it is involved in maintaining the electrochemical gradients of sodium and potassium ions across the plasma membrane, essential for various cellular functions (Hlivko2005The). The alpha4 isoform is sensitive to ouabain, a cardiac glycoside, and its inhibition can eliminate sperm motility, highlighting its importance in reproductive physiology (Hlivko2005The).

The alpha4 isoform regulates intracellular hydrogen ion concentration, crucial for maintaining the pH balance necessary for sperm motility. This regulation is likely mediated through its effect on Na+/H+ exchangers, which use the sodium gradient established by the Na,K-ATPase to extrude H+ from the cell (Hlivko2005The). The activity of the alpha4 isoform is up-regulated during sperm capacitation, supporting hyperpolarization and decreased intracellular sodium concentration, which are characteristic of capacitated spermatozoa (Clausen2017The). The loss of the alpha4 subunit leads to complete male sterility in mice, underscoring its critical role in fertility (Larsen2019Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the ATP1A4 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions. In the context of male fertility, ATP1A4 is crucial for sperm motility and capacitation. Studies have shown that genetically modified mice lacking NKAα4, the protein encoded by ATP1A4, are infertile due to impaired sperm motility and inability to fertilize oocytes. These mice also exhibit increased intracellular Na+ and Ca2+ levels, cytosolic acidification, and depolarized plasma membranes, highlighting the gene's role in maintaining ion homeostasis in sperm cells (Syeda2020The).

In neurological disorders, ATP1A4 has been associated with familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM). A specific mutation, c.1798 C>T, causing a p.(Pro600Ser) amino acid substitution, was identified in an Italian family and segregated with the FHM phenotype. This mutation is predicted to affect protein stability and is considered disease-causing (Palumbo2019Familial). Although ATP1A4 is mainly expressed in the testes, its potential role in hemiplegic migraine suggests a broader impact on neurological health (Sutherland2020Comprehensive).

In cancer, higher mRNA expression of ATP1A4 has been linked to shorter overall survival in ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Huang2020Comprehensive).

## Interactions
The ATP1A4 protein, a testis-specific isoform of Na/K-ATPase, is involved in several critical interactions during sperm capacitation and fertilization. It forms a complex with plakoglobin, E-cadherin, and ankyrin, linking to the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for sperm-oocyte adhesion and fusion. ATP1A4 binds to ankyrin, anchoring it to the actin cytoskeleton and connecting it to the F-actin-plakoglobin-E-cadherin complex (Rajamanickam2019TestisSpecific). ATP1A4 may also interact with phospholipase C zeta (PLCζ), promoting calcium release and meiosis in the oocyte. The β subunits of Na/K-ATPase in sperm and oocyte may interact via N-glycan motifs, facilitating adhesion (Rajamanickam2019TestisSpecific).

In the non-raft membrane fraction, ATP1A4 interacts with proteins such as hexokinase 1, plakophilin-1, 14-3-3 protein ζ/δ, cathepsin D, desmoglein 1, and heat shock protein beta1 (HSPβ1). In the raft fraction, it interacts with glutathione S-transferase (GST) and annexin A2. Both fractions contain proteins like ADAM32, histone H4, actin, acrosin, serum albumin, and plakoglobin, suggesting roles in cell-cell adhesion, signal transduction, and fertilization (Rajamanickam2019TestisSpecific). These interactions highlight ATP1A4's dual role as an enzyme for ion transport and a signaling molecule, influencing sperm capacitation and fertilization processes (Rajamanickam2019TestisSpecific).
