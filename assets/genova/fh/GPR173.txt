# GPR173

## Overview
GPR173 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 173, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is integral to various physiological processes. This receptor is predominantly expressed in the hypothalamus and gonads, where it plays a critical role in the regulation of reproductive hormones and neuroendocrine signaling. GPR173 interacts with the neuropeptide phoenixin, influencing the secretion of key reproductive hormones such as luteinizing hormone (LH) and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) through the cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway (Stein2016Hypothalamic; Treen2016Phoenixin). Beyond its reproductive functions, GPR173 is involved in the regulation of GnRH neuronal migration and may have broader implications in energy homeostasis and the secretion of vasopressin and oxytocin (Stein2016Hypothalamic; Larco2013The). The receptor's interactions and signaling pathways are also relevant in the context of metabolic disorders such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (Kalamon2020Levels).

## Function
GPR173 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a significant role in reproductive hormone regulation and neuroendocrine signaling. It is highly expressed in the hypothalamus and gonads, where it interacts with the neuropeptide phoenixin to regulate the secretion of reproductive hormones such as luteinizing hormone (LH) and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) (Stein2016Hypothalamic; Treen2016Phoenixin). GPR173 activation by phoenixin leads to the upregulation of GnRH and kisspeptin expression through the cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway, which is crucial for maintaining normal reproductive function (McIlwraith2019Regulation; Treen2016Phoenixin).

In addition to its role in reproductive processes, GPR173 is involved in the regulation of GnRH neuronal migration. It interacts with the metabolite GnRH-(1-5) to inhibit the migration of these neurons, potentially aiding in their maturation within the central nervous system (Larco2013The). This receptor is also implicated in energy homeostasis and may influence vasopressin and oxytocin secretion, suggesting broader roles in physiological regulation (Stein2016Hypothalamic).

## Interactions
GPR173, a G protein-coupled receptor, is involved in several interactions that are crucial for its role in reproductive hormone regulation. It acts as a receptor for the neuropeptide phoenixin (PNX), mediating its effects on reproductive genes in hypothalamic GnRH and kisspeptin neurons. This interaction leads to the activation of the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway, which is essential for the up-regulation of GnRH and Kiss1 mRNA expression. The phosphorylation of CREB, a transcription factor, is a key event in this pathway, as CREB binds to promoter regions of target genes to regulate their transcription (Treen2016Phoenixin).

GPR173 is also implicated in the modulation of signaling pathways such as ERK1/2, PKA, and Akt, which are involved in cellular processes like proliferation and steroid biosynthesis. These pathways are particularly relevant in the context of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), where aberrant signaling contributes to metabolic defects and excessive androgen production (Kalamon2020Levels).

The receptor's interaction with phoenixin is crucial for its role in reproductive physiology, as demonstrated by the disruption of estrous cyclicity and LH secretion upon GPR173 knockdown (Stein2016Hypothalamic).
