# FGFRL1

## Overview
FGFRL1, or fibroblast growth factor receptor-like 1, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in development and differentiation. The protein, also referred to as FGFRL1, is a member of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family but is distinct in that it lacks an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain, which is typical of other FGFRs. This structural difference suggests that FGFRL1 may function as a decoy receptor, modulating fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling by sequestering FGF ligands. FGFRL1 is implicated in critical developmental processes, including skeletal and kidney development, and is expressed in tissues such as skeletal muscle and growth plates. Its role in modulating cell differentiation and proliferation underscores its importance in both normal physiology and pathological conditions (Gerber2020Functional; Trueb2010Biology; Kähkönen2018Role).

## Structure
FGFRL1, also known as fibroblast growth factor receptor like 1, is a protein characterized by a specific domain structure that includes three extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains, a single transmembrane helix, and a short intracellular domain lacking tyrosine kinase activity (ZHUANG2010Genomewide; Trueb2010Biology). The extracellular domain consists of three Ig-like domains, named D1, D2, and D3, with the D2 domain containing a basic region responsible for heparin interaction (Trueb2010Biology). The D3 domain is the most conserved and is involved in FGF ligand binding (Trueb2010Biology). 

The intracellular domain is approximately 100 amino acids long and contains a histidine-rich motif that binds zinc ions (Trueb2010Biology; Trueb2012Role). FGFRL1 forms constitutive homodimers at the plasma membrane and can recruit signaling molecules like Spred1 (Trueb2012Role). 

Post-translational modifications include glycosylation, with FGFRL1 having four glycosylation sites for asparagine-linked carbohydrates (Trueb2010Biology). Alternative splicing of FGFRL1 has been observed, resulting in mRNA species missing sequences for certain Ig domains, though the significance of this is unclear (Trueb2010Biology).

## Function
FGFRL1, also known as fibroblast growth factor receptor-like 1, is a member of the FGFR family that plays a significant role in cell signaling and development. Unlike classical FGFRs, FGFRL1 lacks an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain, which suggests it cannot signal through transautophosphorylation. Instead, it may function as a decoy receptor, sequestering fibroblast growth factor (FGF) ligands away from conventional FGFRs, thereby modulating FGF signaling pathways (Trueb2010Biology). FGFRL1 is involved in the differentiation of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) into osteoblasts and adipocytes, with its expression being upregulated during these processes (Kähkönen2018Role). It is expressed in various tissues, including skeletal muscle and growth plates of long bones, indicating its role in skeletal development (Kähkönen2018Role).

FGFRL1 is also implicated in kidney development, particularly nephrogenesis, where it is expressed in the ureteric bud and nephrogenic structures. Its disruption can lead to kidney agenesis, highlighting its essential role in this process (Gerber2020Functional). The receptor's extracellular domain interacts with FGF ligands and heparin, influencing cell proliferation negatively and promoting cell differentiation (Trueb2010Biology). FGFRL1's function in healthy human cells likely involves modulating FGFR signaling and influencing cell differentiation, particularly in bone and kidney tissues (Gerber2020Functional; Kähkönen2018Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FGFRL1 gene are associated with several human diseases and developmental disorders. FGFRL1 mutations have been linked to craniosynostosis, a condition characterized by the premature fusion of skull bones, which can lead to abnormal head shape and facial features. A specific frameshift mutation in FGFRL1 has been identified in a patient with craniosynostosis, radio-ulnar synostosis, and genital abnormalities, previously diagnosed with Antley-Bixler syndrome. This mutation results in a gain-of-function scenario, where the mutant protein remains at the plasma membrane, potentially causing skeletal malformations (Trueb2010Biology).

FGFRL1 is also implicated in Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome, a genetic disorder characterized by growth delay, craniofacial dysgenesis, developmental delay, and epilepsy. A deletion in chromosome 4p16.3, which includes FGFRL1, has been suggested as a candidate for facial abnormalities in some patients with this syndrome (Trueb2010Biology).

In mouse models, FGFRL1 knock-out results in severe developmental defects, including diaphragmatic defects and renal agenesis, indicating its critical role in organ development. These findings suggest that FGFRL1 is essential for proper organ development, and its disruption can lead to significant developmental disorders (Helsten2015Fibroblast; Trueb2010Biology).

## Interactions
FGFRL1 interacts with various fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), including FGF2, FGF3, FGF4, FGF8, FGF10, and FGF22. These interactions are primarily mediated through its extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig) domains, particularly the Ig2 domain, which is crucial for binding FGF8 (Trueb2010Biology; Zhuang2020Dissecting). The Ig2 domain also interacts with heparin and heparan sulfate, which are important for FGFRL1's function and purification (Trueb2010Biology).

FGFRL1 lacks an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain, distinguishing it from classical FGFRs. It may function as a decoy receptor, sequestering FGF ligands from conventional FGFRs, or it might modulate FGF signaling indirectly, possibly through interactions with FGFR1 (AMANN2013Evidence; Trueb2010Biology). FGFRL1's interaction with FGF8 is particularly significant in kidney development, where it may act as a co-receptor to present FGF8 to FGFR1, facilitating downstream signaling (AMANN2013Evidence).

The receptor's intracellular domain, although not essential for viability, influences its turnover at the cell membrane and may recruit signaling molecules like tyrosine phosphatases, although no phosphorylation has been observed (Gerber2020Functional; Trueb2010Biology).
