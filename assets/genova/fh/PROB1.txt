# PROB1

## Overview
Proline rich basic protein 1 is encoded by the PROB1 gene in humans. This protein is characterized by its abundance of proline residues, which contribute to its structural properties and potential interactions with other cellular components. While the specific biological functions of proline rich basic protein 1 are not fully elucidated, proteins rich in proline often play roles in signaling pathways and cellular architecture. The PROB1 gene is of interest in various research contexts due to its potential involvement in cellular processes and disease mechanisms, although detailed functional studies are still required to fully understand its role (Qiu2020aarFDC).
