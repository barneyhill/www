# CD74

## Overview
CD74 is a gene that encodes the CD74 protein, also known as the invariant chain, which is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein. This protein plays a pivotal role in the immune system, primarily by acting as a chaperone for major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) molecules, facilitating their assembly and transport to endosomal compartments for antigen presentation (Schröder2016The). Beyond its chaperone function, CD74 serves as a receptor for the cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), initiating signaling pathways that are crucial for cell proliferation and survival (Farr2020Role). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including B-cell maturation, dendritic cell migration, and antigen uptake, highlighting its multifaceted role in immune regulation (Schröder2016The; BeckerHerman2005CD74). CD74's expression and function are also implicated in several cancers and immune-related conditions, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Vargas2023Analysis; Schröder2016The).

## Structure
CD74, also known as the invariant chain, is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein involved in antigen presentation. Its primary structure includes a short N-terminal cytoplasmic tail of 28 amino acids, a single 24-amino acid transmembrane region, and a luminal domain (BeckerHerman2005CD74). The protein has several isoforms, including p33, p35, p41, and p43, which arise from alternative splicing and alternative start codons (Schröder2016The; Kok2018High).

The secondary structure of CD74 features alpha helices, particularly in its transmembrane domain (Kok2018High). In its quaternary structure, CD74 forms homo-trimers, which are crucial for its function in MHC class II assembly and antigen presentation (Schröder2016The). The luminal domain of CD74 is involved in trimerization and contains a critical region for this process (Schröder2016The).

CD74 undergoes several post-translational modifications, including N- and O-glycosylation, S-acylation, and phosphorylation, which are important for its trafficking and function (Schröder2016The). The protein also interacts with macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) through a binding site located between the transmembrane and trimerization domains (Kok2018High).

## Function
CD74, also known as the invariant chain, is a type II transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in the immune system, particularly in antigen presentation. It functions as a chaperone for major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) molecules, facilitating their assembly and transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to endosomal compartments. In these compartments, CD74 undergoes degradation, allowing MHCII to load antigen-derived peptides, which is essential for effective antigen presentation to T cells (Schröder2016The).

CD74 also acts as a receptor for the cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), initiating signaling pathways that include the activation of ERK-1/2, PI3K-Akt, and NF-κB, which are crucial for cell proliferation and survival (Leng2003MIF; Farr2020Role). The protein is involved in B-cell maturation and survival by activating NF-κB-mediated transcription through the release of its intracellular domain (CD74-ICD) following intramembrane cleavage (Starlets2006Cellsurface; BeckerHerman2005CD74).

In dendritic cells, CD74 regulates migration and antigen uptake, influencing the dynamics of macropinocytosis and endosomal trafficking, which are vital for antigen presentation (Schröder2016The). CD74's role extends to influencing endosomal fusion and delaying cargo transport, thereby affecting the half-life of MHCII molecules (Schröder2016The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the CD74 gene are implicated in various cancers and immune-related conditions. CD74 is overexpressed in numerous cancers, including hematological malignancies like multiple myeloma and solid tumors such as breast, gastrointestinal, lung, kidney, bladder, prostate, pancreatic, and central nervous system cancers (Vargas2023Analysis; Schröder2016The). In bladder cancer, high CD74 expression correlates with advanced disease characteristics, including older age at diagnosis, high grade, and advanced stage (Schröder2016The). 

In gliomas, CD74 is associated with poor prognosis and increased immune cell infiltration, suggesting its role in the tumor microenvironment (Xu2021CD74). CD74's interaction with macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) activates pathways that promote tumor growth and immune evasion (Zhang2022Bioinformatics). 

In ovarian carcinoma, CD74 is linked to poor prognosis and immune suppression, with its expression correlating with immune checkpoints and inflammatory cytokines (Zhang2022Bioinformatics). In acute myeloid leukemia, CD74, in conjunction with LGALS3, is associated with significantly reduced survival and remission durations (Ruvolo2019LGALS3). These findings highlight CD74's potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in various cancers.

## Interactions
CD74, also known as the invariant chain, is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins, influencing various cellular processes. It interacts with major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) molecules, forming a nonameric complex that includes three MHCII alpha-beta dimers and a CD74 trimer. This interaction is facilitated by the CLIP segment within CD74, which occupies the peptide-binding site of MHCII, preventing premature peptide binding during MHCII's transit through the biosynthetic pathway (Schröder2016The). CD74 also interacts with the macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) at the cell surface, activating the ERK-1/2 cascade and influencing inflammation (Le2015Functional; Leng2003MIF).

CD74 forms a functional heteromeric receptor complex with CXCR4, which is responsive to MIF signaling and plays a role in inflammatory responses and cell signaling pathways, such as AKT activation (Schwartz2009A). Additionally, CD74 interacts with CD44, acting as a signal-transducing co-receptor, and with the HIV-1 Vpu protein, which prevents MHCII trafficking and CD74's signal cascade, undermining immune function (Le2015Functional; Schwartz2009A). These interactions highlight CD74's multifaceted roles in immune response, inflammation, and cellular signaling.
