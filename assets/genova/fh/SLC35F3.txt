# SLC35F3

## Overview
The SLC35F3 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 35 member F3, which is a transmembrane protein involved in the transport of thiamine, also known as vitamin B1, across cellular membranes. This protein plays a pivotal role in intracellular thiamine transport, which is essential for carbohydrate metabolism as thiamine serves as a coenzyme in metabolic pathways such as glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Park2023Effects). SLC35F3 is predominantly expressed in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, and it is primarily active in the mitochondria, where it influences cellular energy production (Zang2016Association; Park2023Effects). Variations in the SLC35F3 gene have been linked to metabolic and cardiovascular conditions, highlighting its clinical significance in these areas (Zang2016Association).

## Function
The SLC35F3 gene encodes a protein that functions as a thiamine transporter, playing a crucial role in intracellular thiamine transport. Thiamine, or vitamin B1, is essential for carbohydrate metabolism, as it serves as a coenzyme in key metabolic pathways such as glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Park2023Effects). The SLC35F3 protein is part of the solute carrier family, specifically involved in the transport of nucleotide sugars across cellular membranes, and is predominantly expressed in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus (Zang2016Association).

In healthy human cells, SLC35F3 is primarily active in the mitochondria, where it influences cellular energy production and overall metabolic function by regulating thiamine transport. This regulation is critical for cells with increased energy requirements, as thiamine acts as a coenzyme in carbohydrate metabolism (Park2023Effects). The gene's activity is linked to inherited cardiovascular traits and metabolic dysfunctions, with variations in the gene affecting blood thiamine content and potentially contributing to conditions such as metabolic syndrome and hypertension (Zang2016Association; Park2023Effects).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SLC35F3 gene have been associated with several metabolic and cardiovascular conditions. The SLC35F3 gene is involved in thiamine transport, which is crucial for carbohydrate metabolism. Variants in this gene, such as the rs10910387 T allele, have been linked to an increased incidence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in Korean middle-aged adults. This risk is particularly pronounced in individuals with high carbohydrate intake, where the TT genotype is associated with higher levels of triglycerides and diastolic blood pressure, both components of MetS (Park2023Effects).

In a Chinese Han population, the SLC35F3 variant rs34032258 has been associated with hypertension, specifically affecting diastolic blood pressure and metabolic traits like blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. This variant shows a significant association with hypertensive traits, particularly in obese individuals, suggesting a potential role in hypertension susceptibility (Zang2016Association).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of SLC35F3 in metabolic and cardiovascular health, emphasizing the importance of considering genetic factors in dietary recommendations and disease prevention strategies.
