# ZBED4

## Overview
ZBED4 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger BED-type containing 4 protein, which is characterized by its four BED zinc-finger domains. These domains are integral to the protein's function as a transcription factor, allowing it to bind DNA and RNA with high specificity, particularly targeting poly-G tracts and GC-box consensus sequences (Mokhonov2012SequenceSpecific). The protein is predominantly expressed in the human retina, where it plays a crucial role in regulating the transcription of genes essential for retinal function, such as vimentin, rhodopsin, and opsins (Mokhonov2012SequenceSpecific). ZBED4 also interacts with various nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins, including Scaffold Attachment Factor B1 (SAFB1) and Estrogen Receptor alpha (ERa), suggesting its involvement in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation (Mokhonov2012SequenceSpecific). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its association with neurodevelopmental disorders, including schizophrenia and Phelan-McDermid Syndrome, where its haploinsufficiency and intolerance to loss of function mutations have been implicated in the pathogenesis of these conditions (Mitz2018Identification; Breen2022Large).

## Structure
ZBED4 is a protein characterized by the presence of four BED zinc-finger domains, which are known for their DNA-binding capabilities (Mokhonov2012SequenceSpecific). The primary structure of ZBED4 includes sequences rich in cysteine and histidine residues, typical of zinc finger motifs. The secondary structure of ZBED4, as determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy, consists of approximately 32% alpha-helices, 18% beta-sheets, 20% turns, and 30% unordered structures (Mokhonov2012SequenceSpecific). The protein also contains two LXXLL nuclear receptor-interacting modules in its N-terminal half and an hACT dimerization domain in the C-terminal half (Mokhonov2012SequenceSpecific).

The tertiary structure is stabilized by zinc ion coordination, which is crucial for the correct conformation of the zinc-finger motifs (Mokhonov2012SequenceSpecific). ZBED4 can bind to DNA and RNA, particularly interacting with poly-G tracts and GC-box consensus sequences (Mokhonov2012SequenceSpecific). The protein also interacts with nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins such as Scaffold Attachment Factor B1 (SAFB1), Estrogen Receptor alpha (ERa), and cellular Myosin 9 (MYH9), indicating its role in transcriptional regulation (Mokhonov2012SequenceSpecific).

## Function
ZBED4 is a zinc-finger protein involved in gene transcription regulation, primarily active in the human retina. It is expressed in cone photoreceptors and glial Müller cells, where it binds to DNA and RNA sequences, particularly poly-G tracts and GC-box consensus sequences, influencing transcriptional activity from G-rich promoters (Mokhonov2012SequenceSpecific; Jin2020ZBED1DREF:). ZBED4 acts as a transcription factor, enhancing the transcription of genes with poly-G tracts in their promoter regions, such as vimentin, rhodopsin, and opsins, which are crucial for retinal function (Mokhonov2012SequenceSpecific).

The protein contains four BED zinc-finger domains and two LXXLL nuclear receptor-interacting modules, suggesting it may function as a co-activator or co-repressor of nuclear hormone receptors (Mokhonov2012SequenceSpecific). ZBED4 interacts with several nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins, including Scaffold Attachment Factor B1 (SAFB1), Estrogen Receptor alpha (ERa), and Myosin 9 (MYH9), indicating roles in chromatin remodeling, transcription regulation, and possibly protein and vesicle trafficking (Mokhonov2012SequenceSpecific). These interactions suggest that ZBED4 is involved in complex regulatory networks that influence cellular differentiation and proliferation, particularly in the retina (Mokhonov2012SequenceSpecific).

## Clinical Significance
ZBED4 is implicated in several neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. Haploinsufficiency of ZBED4 has been associated with neurodevelopmental impacts, including schizophrenia, due to its role in cerebellar development and function (Mitz2018Identification). In the context of Phelan-McDermid Syndrome (PMS), ZBED4 is affected by large deletions, particularly Class II mutations, which lead to significant under-expression of genes, potentially impacting various biological systems across multiple tissues (Breen2022Large). These mutations are linked to intellectual disability, severe speech delay, and structural brain abnormalities in patients with deletions at 22q13.33, which include ZBED4 (Cirillo2020Clinical).

ZBED4 is classified as 'definitely LoF intolerant' with a pLI score ≥ 0.9, indicating its potential intolerance to loss of function mutations, which may contribute to the phenotypic manifestations observed in PMS (Breen2022Large). Despite these associations, specific clinical significance regarding ZBED4 mutations, expression alterations, or interaction changes remains under investigation, with current studies focusing on the broader impact of genetic disruptions in related syndromes (Cirillo2020Clinical; Mitz2018Identification).

## Interactions
ZBED4 is known to interact with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in gene transcription and cellular processes. It binds specifically to DNA and RNA, with a strong affinity for poly-G tracts and GC-box consensus sequences. The binding to GC-boxes is influenced by the surrounding nucleotides, highlighting the sequence-specific nature of ZBED4's interactions (Mokhonov2012SequenceSpecific).

In Y79 retinoblastoma cells, ZBED4 interacts with several proteins, including Scaffold Attachment Factor B1 (SAFB1), Estrogen Receptor alpha (ERa), and cellular Myosin 9 (MYH9). The interaction with SAFB1 occurs both in vitro and in vivo, with co-localization observed in the nucleus, suggesting a role in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation (Mokhonov2012SequenceSpecific). ZBED4 also forms part of a complex with ERa, potentially influencing the transcription of estrogen-responsive genes (Mokhonov2012SequenceSpecific). The interaction with MYH9, observed in the cytoplasm, suggests a role in protein and vesicle trafficking (Mokhonov2012SequenceSpecific).

These interactions indicate that ZBED4 is involved in complex protein networks that regulate gene expression and other cellular functions, particularly in the retina (Mokhonov2012SequenceSpecific).
