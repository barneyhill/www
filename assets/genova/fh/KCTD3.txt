# KCTD3

## Overview
KCTD3 is a gene that encodes the protein potassium channel tetramerization domain containing 3, which is a member of the KCTD protein family. This protein is characterized by the presence of a BTB (Bric-à-brac, Tramtrack, and Broad complex) domain, which is homologous to the tetramerization domain of voltage-gated potassium channels, and a C-terminal region that forms an eight-bladed β-propeller structure (Esposito2022Alphafold; CaoEhlker2013Upregulation). KCTD3 functions primarily as an adaptor protein for Cullin E3 ligases, playing a significant role in ubiquitination and deubiquitination processes, which are crucial for protein degradation and stability (Skoblov2013Protein). It is involved in modulating ion channel activity, particularly in the brain, and is implicated in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and protein-protein interactions (Shimojima2023Biallelic). Clinically, KCTD3 has been associated with intellectual disability and certain leukemia subtypes, highlighting its importance in both neurodevelopmental and oncological contexts (Kessi2020Intellectual; Buono2023A).

## Structure
KCTD3 is a protein characterized by the presence of a BTB (Bric-à-brac, Tramtrack, and Broad complex) domain at its N-terminus, which is homologous to the tetramerization domain of voltage-gated potassium channels (CaoEhlker2013Upregulation). This domain facilitates the formation of stable pentamers, as confirmed by experimental data and AlphaFold predictions (Esposito2022Alphafold). The C-terminal region of KCTD3 forms a large, well-folded domain that adopts an eight-bladed β-propeller structure, which is unlikely to oligomerize due to its size and defined nature (Esposito2022Alphafold).

KCTD3 shares about 55% sequence identity with SETA-binding protein 1 (SB1), and both proteins contain five WD repeats downstream of their BTB domain, which are not present in other KCTD proteins (CaoEhlker2013Upregulation). The protein is approximately 90 kDa in size and is expressed in several tissues, including the brain, liver, kidney, and heart (CaoEhlker2013Upregulation). The BTB domain of KCTD3 is crucial for its interaction with other proteins, such as the HCN3 channel, where it plays a role in up-regulating the channel's current density (CaoEhlker2013Upregulation).

## Function
KCTD3 is a protein involved in several molecular processes, primarily related to ubiquitination and deubiquitination. It functions as an adaptor protein for Cullin E3 ligases, playing a role in the regulation of protein degradation and stability through deubiquitination. KCTD3 can bind to the JAMM-family deubiquitinating enzyme COPS6 and ubiquitin-specific protease USP13, suggesting its involvement in cellular processes related to protein modification and turnover (Skoblov2013Protein).

KCTD3 is also implicated in modulating ion channel activity in the brain. It contains five WD repeats and a BTB domain, which are crucial for its function. KCTD3 has been shown to increase the current density of the Hcn3 protein by promoting its trafficking to the cell membrane, indicating a role in neuronal excitability and cellular homeostasis (Shimojima2023Biallelic).

In terms of cellular localization, KCTD3 is active in the cytoplasm, where it participates in signal transduction and protein-protein interactions. These activities are essential for maintaining normal neurodevelopmental processes and brain function (Shimojima2023Biallelic).

## Clinical Significance
KCTD3 has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression and mutations. In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), KCTD3 is significantly upregulated in B-cell ALL (B-ALL) compared to healthy controls, suggesting its potential role in the pathogenesis of this leukemia subtype (Buono2023A). The differential expression of KCTD3 can help discriminate between B-ALL and T-cell ALL (T-ALL), indicating its clinical significance as a biomarker for leukemia subtypes (Buono2023A).

In the context of neurological disorders, KCTD3 is associated with intellectual disability (ID). The gene is mentioned in a systematic review as presenting only loss-of-function properties, which are linked to global developmental delay (GDD) and ID (Kessi2020Intellectual). This suggests that mutations in KCTD3 can disrupt normal protein interactions, contributing to the pathogenesis of these conditions.

KCTD3 is also involved in cellular processes related to protein ubiquitination and deubiquitination, which are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Its interactions with proteins like RhoB and Cullin3 suggest a role in cytoskeletal regulation, which could be relevant for understanding its involvement in disease mechanisms (Skoblov2013Protein).

## Interactions
KCTD3 is involved in various protein-protein interactions, particularly in the context of ubiquitination and deubiquitination processes. It is part of Clade D of the KCTD protein family, which can bind to the JAMM-family deubiquitinating enzyme COPS6 and ubiquitin-specific protease USP13, suggesting a role in deubiquitination (Skoblov2013Protein). KCTD3 may act as an adaptor for Cullin E3 ligases, which are involved in protein degradation pathways (Skoblov2013Protein). The interaction with USP13 is further supported by assays evaluating USP13-dependent stability of substrates like the transcription factor MITF and the ubiquitin ligase SIAH2, indicating KCTD3's role in regulating deubiquitination (Skoblov2013Protein).

KCTD3 also interacts with other KCTD family members, such as KCTD5, forming hetero-oligomeric complexes. This interaction has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assays, indicating a robust interaction between KCTD3 and KCTD5 (Liao2023KCTD5). These interactions suggest that KCTD3 plays a significant role in cellular signaling and protein regulation through its involvement in complex protein networks.
