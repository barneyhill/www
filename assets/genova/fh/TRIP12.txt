# TRIP12

## Overview
TRIP12 is a gene that encodes the protein thyroid hormone receptor interactor 12, which functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is involved in the ubiquitination process, a critical cellular mechanism for protein degradation and regulation. TRIP12 plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating protein stability, DNA damage repair, and chromatin remodeling. It is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, influencing processes such as cell cycle progression and genomic stability. The protein's structure includes several domains, such as a catalytic HECT domain, WWE and ARM protein-protein interaction domains, and an intrinsically disordered region, which contribute to its diverse functional roles (Brunet2020E3). Mutations in the TRIP12 gene have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and various cancers, underscoring its clinical significance (Brunet2020E3).

## Structure
The TRIP12 protein is a large E3 ubiquitin ligase with an estimated molecular weight between 189 and 227 kDa for its long forms. It contains several characterized domains that contribute to its structure and function, including a catalytic HECT domain, WWE and ARM protein-protein interaction domains, and an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) (Brunet2020E3). The HECT domain, located at residues 1552-1592, is crucial for TRIP12's ubiquitin ligase activity, involving interaction with ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 and a catalytic cysteine residue at position 1959 (Brunet2020E3). The WWE domain, found between residues 749 and 836, is important for protein-protein interactions and is involved in binding poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) (Brunet2020E3). ARM repeats, located between residues 437 and 715, are implicated in various cellular functions such as cell signaling and ubiquitination (Brunet2020E3).

TRIP12 is translated from 26 different mRNA splicing variants, resulting in 14 different protein isoforms. The long isoforms range from 1722 to 2068 amino acids, while the short isoforms contain 440 and 411 amino acids (Brunet2020E3). Isoform c, which is 1992 amino acids long, is used as a reference for further description (Brunet2020E3). The protein is localized in the nucleus, facilitated by two putative bipartite Nuclear Localization Signals (NLS) in its N-terminal region (Brunet2020E3). Despite the detailed understanding of these domains, the complete 3D structure of TRIP12 has not yet been established in crystal form (Brunet2020E3).

## Function
TRIP12, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, plays a crucial role in several cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in the regulation of protein stability and degradation through ubiquitination, targeting various substrates such as ASXL1, USP7, PTF1a, SOX6, RNF168, and BAF57. This activity is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating gene expression (Brunet2020E3).

TRIP12 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it influences cell cycle progression, DNA damage repair, and chromatin remodeling. It regulates the DNA damage response by controlling the ubiquitination of histones and the activity of RNF168, preventing excessive chromatin ubiquitylation and ensuring proper DNA repair (Gudjonsson2012TRIP12; Brunet2020E3). TRIP12 also interacts with the SWI/SNF complex and Polycomb Repressive Complexes, affecting epigenetic modifications and gene silencing (Brunet2020E3).

In the context of cell cycle regulation, TRIP12 is essential for mitotic progression and chromosome stability. It influences the duration of DNA replication and mitotic entry, ensuring proper chromosome segregation and cell proliferation (Larrieu2020The). Its role in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining genomic stability and proper cellular function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TRIP12 gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders and cancers. Pathogenic variants in TRIP12 have been linked to intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), with features such as speech delay, craniofacial dysmorphism, and seizures. These mutations often result in protein-level changes, including stop changes, frame shifts, and missense changes, which impact neuronal signaling and cognitive functions (Brunet2020E3; Donoghue2020Novel). TRIP12 is also implicated in Clark-Baraitser syndrome, characterized by mental retardation, craniofacial dysmorphism, and obesity (Brunet2020E3; van2022Episignature).

In cancer, TRIP12 gene alterations are observed in various types, including endometrial carcinoma, glioblastoma, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Overexpression of TRIP12 is linked to poor survival rates in cancers such as breast and ovarian cancer, and it affects sensitivity to PARP inhibitors by limiting PARP1 presence at chromatin (Brunet2020E3). TRIP12 is necessary for acinar-to-ductal metaplasia and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia formation, processes involved in pancreatic cancer development (Brunet2023The). These findings highlight TRIP12's role in both neurodevelopmental disorders and oncogenesis.

## Interactions
TRIP12, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is involved in various protein interactions that play crucial roles in cellular processes. It interacts with a range of proteins, including those involved in ubiquitination and transcriptional regulation. TRIP12 has been identified to interact with 76 unique proteins, with 58 of these involved in cellular macromolecule metabolic processes, particularly ubiquitination, and 32 in the positive regulation of nucleobase-containing compound metabolism (Brunet2020E3).

TRIP12 is known to interact with chromatin through an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) located in its N-terminal quarter, which is crucial for its chromatin association (Brunet2020E3; Larrieu2020The). It also interacts with components of the SWI/SNF complex, such as BAF57, affecting chromatin remodeling and gene expression (Brunet2020E3). TRIP12 is involved in the degradation of RNF168, a protein that plays a role in the DNA damage response, by ubiquitinating it for proteasomal degradation (Brunet2020E3).

TRIP12 also participates in the formation of K29/K48 heterotypic ubiquitin chains on BRD4, facilitated by its recruitment through the CRL2 VHL complex, although it does not directly interact with BRD4 (KaihoSoma2021TRIP12). These interactions highlight TRIP12's role in regulating protein stability and genome expression.
