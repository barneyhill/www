# FKBP1B

## Overview
FKBP1B is a gene that encodes the FK506-binding protein 12.6, also known as FKBP prolyl isomerase 1B, which is a member of the FK506-binding protein family. This protein is categorized as a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, playing a pivotal role in protein folding by catalyzing the isomerization of proline residues. FKBP1B is particularly significant in the regulation of calcium ion (Ca2+) homeostasis, especially within neurons and cardiac muscle cells, where it stabilizes ryanodine receptors to modulate calcium release. This function is crucial for maintaining neuronal excitability, plasticity, and proper cardiac physiology. Additionally, FKBP1B interacts with the immunosuppressant rapamycin, influencing the mTOR signaling pathway, which is involved in autophagy, cell growth, and survival. Alterations in FKBP1B expression have been linked to various clinical conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and cardiac dysfunction, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Kuznik2019Epigenetic; Williams2021ALK2; Soto2021Transcriptional).

## Structure
FKBP1B, also known as FKBP12.6, is a member of the FK506-binding protein family, characterized by its peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity. The protein consists of a single FKBP domain that facilitates protein folding by catalyzing the cis-trans isomerization of proline residues. Structurally, FKBP1B forms a compact tertiary structure composed of a β-sheet and α-helices, which is typical for proteins in this family (Zissimopoulos2012Disparate).

FKBP1B shares approximately 83.3% sequence identity with FKBP12 over 108 amino acids, indicating a high degree of structural similarity (Williams2021ALK2). The protein's interaction with other molecules, such as the ryanodine receptor, is crucial for its role in regulating calcium release in muscle cells (Zissimopoulos2012Disparate). FKBP1B does not have widely recognized splice variant isoforms, and common post-translational modifications include phosphorylation (Zissimopoulos2012Disparate).

The protein's ability to bind to the ALK2 receptor kinase is structurally conserved with the ALK2-FKBP12 complex, highlighting its role in inhibiting receptor activation by preventing phosphorylation necessary for SMAD recruitment (Williams2021ALK2). This interaction involves specific residues on ALK2, such as Phe198 and Leu199, which extend into the FK506-binding pocket of FKBP12.6 (Williams2021ALK2).

## Function
The FKBP1B gene encodes the FK506-binding protein 12.6/1b, a peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase that plays a crucial role in regulating calcium ion (Ca2+) homeostasis in neurons, particularly in the hippocampus, which is essential for learning and memory (Kuznik2019Epigenetic). FKBP1b inhibits the release of Ca2+ from ryanodine-sensitive calcium channels in the sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum of neurons, helping to maintain proper neuronal function by stabilizing Ca2+ signaling. This stabilization is vital for neuronal excitability and plasticity (Kuznik2019Epigenetic).

In healthy cells, FKBP1b interacts with the immunosuppressant rapamycin, affecting the mTOR signaling pathway, which regulates autophagy, cell growth, and survival (Kuznik2019Epigenetic). The protein's role in calcium signaling is also significant in cardiac muscle cells, where it stabilizes the ryanodine receptor, influencing heart muscle contraction and overall cardiac function. This function is critical for maintaining calcium homeostasis and proper cardiac physiology (Kuznik2019Epigenetic). During aging, a decrease in FKBP1b expression can lead to dysregulation of Ca2+ homeostasis, which is associated with signs of central nervous system aging and neurodegenerative diseases (Kuznik2019Epigenetic).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FKBP1B gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In ovarian cancer, FKBP1B is associated with resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy. The gene is hypermethylated and inhibited in resistant ovarian cancer cell lines, contributing to chemotherapy resistance. Restoration of FKBP1B expression in these cells has been shown to increase sensitivity to platinum treatment, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target to overcome drug resistance (Soto2021Transcriptional).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, decreased expression of FKBP1B is linked to impaired calcium signaling in neurons, particularly in the hippocampus. This impairment is associated with aging and conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. FKBP1B interacts with ryanodine receptors to regulate calcium release, and its dysfunction can lead to increased calcium currents and accelerated aging of the nervous system. Overexpression of FKBP1B in animal models has been shown to prevent age-related memory loss and improve cognitive function, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target for age-related cognitive decline (Kuznik2019Epigenetic).

In gliomas, FKBP1B has been identified as a high-risk gene associated with poor prognosis. Low expression of FKBP1B correlates with better survival outcomes, suggesting its involvement in tumor progression (Xu2020An).

## Interactions
FKBP1B, also known as FK506-binding protein 12.6, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function. It interacts with ryanodine-sensitive calcium channels (RyR) in neurons, where it plays a role in regulating calcium ion (Ca2+) release. This interaction is significant in maintaining Ca2+ homeostasis, particularly in hippocampal neurons, and its dysfunction can contribute to aging-related neuronal issues (Kuznik2019Epigenetic).

FKBP1B is also known to bind to the immunosuppressant rapamycin, which affects its interaction with the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). This binding can influence autophagy, cell growth, and survival by inhibiting mTOR kinase activity (Soto2021Transcriptional). In myocytes, rapamycin displaces FKBP1B from RyR, leading to increased Ca2+ release (Kuznik2019Epigenetic).

While FKBP1B shares similarities with FKBP12, another member of the FKBP family, specific interactions of FKBP1B with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond those mentioned are not well-documented in the provided context. The role of FKBP1B in various cellular processes, including its potential involvement in cancer treatment response, suggests it may participate in additional interactions that are yet to be fully elucidated (Soto2021Transcriptional).
