# ADAMTS4

## Overview
ADAMTS4 is a gene that encodes the protein ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 4, commonly referred to as aggrecanase-1. This protein is a member of the ADAMTS (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin Motifs) family, which is characterized by its role as a metalloproteinase involved in the degradation of extracellular matrix components. ADAMTS4 is particularly noted for its ability to cleave aggrecan, a critical proteoglycan in cartilage, thereby playing a significant role in tissue remodeling and repair processes (Tortorella2000The; Glasson2004Characterization). The protein's activity is regulated through post-translational modifications and interactions with other proteins, which influence its substrate specificity and enzymatic function (Gao2002Activation; Dennler2023Phylogenetic). ADAMTS4 is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, brain, and skeletal muscle, indicating its broader physiological significance beyond cartilage (Glasson2004Characterization). Its dysregulation has been implicated in several pathological conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Novak2022The; Lemarchant2017ADAMTS‐4).

## Structure
ADAMTS4, also known as aggrecanase-1, is a member of the ADAMTS family characterized by a multi-domain structure. The protein consists of a signal peptide, a pro-domain, a metalloproteinase catalytic domain, a disintegrin-like domain, a thrombospondin type 1 motif (TSR), a cysteine-rich domain, and a spacer domain (Verma2011ADAMTS4; Takeda2016ADAM). The metalloproteinase domain contains a consensus HEXXHXXGXXH sequence, which is typical of the metzincin superfamily of metalloproteinases, and includes a 'met-turn' that is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Verma2011ADAMTS4; Takeda2016ADAM).

The disintegrin-like domain does not contain an RGD integrin recognition sequence, which is common in other ADAMTS proteins (PORTER2005The). The TSR motif is essential for binding to aggrecan, a major cartilage proteoglycan, and this interaction is mediated through the C-terminal spacer region (PORTER2005The). The cysteine-rich domain contains ten conserved cysteine residues, contributing to the protein's structural stability (PORTER2005The).

ADAMTS4 undergoes post-translational modifications, including N-terminal processing by signal peptidase and removal of the pro-domain, which is important for enzyme latency and proper folding (PORTER2005The). The protein can exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which affects its activity and substrate specificity (Fosang2008ADAMTS5:).

## Function
ADAMTS4, also known as aggrecanase-1, is a member of the ADAMTS family of metalloproteinases, which plays a crucial role in the degradation of extracellular matrix components, particularly in cartilage. It is primarily involved in the proteolytic cleavage of aggrecan, a major chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan that provides compressibility and resilience to cartilage. This activity is essential for normal tissue remodeling and repair processes, especially in the extracellular matrix of cartilage (Tortorella2000The; Glasson2004Characterization).

The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, brain, lung, and skeletal muscle, indicating its broader role beyond cartilage (Glasson2004Characterization). ADAMTS4 is activated through C-terminal truncation, which is necessary for its proteolytic activity. The active forms of ADAMTS4, such as p60 and p50, are generated through this processing and are capable of degrading aggrecan and versican, contributing to the maintenance of extracellular matrix homeostasis (Gao2002Activation).

In healthy human cells, ADAMTS4's function involves the regulation of aggrecan turnover, which is important for maintaining cartilage integrity. The enzyme's activity is modulated by its C-terminal domains, which influence its proteolytic activity and inhibitor binding properties (Gao2002Activation; Tortorella2000The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ADAMTS4 gene have been implicated in various cardiovascular and central nervous system diseases. In atherosclerosis, ADAMTS4 contributes to plaque instability by cleaving proteoglycans such as versican and aggrecan, which promotes smooth muscle cell apoptosis and vessel atrophy (Novak2022The). Elevated levels of ADAMTS4 are associated with coronary artery disease and correlate with disease severity (Novak2022The). In thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections, increased ADAMTS4 expression is linked to extracellular matrix degradation and inflammation, contributing to disease progression (Ren2013ADAMTS1; Ren2017Critical).

In the central nervous system, ADAMTS4 is involved in ischemic stroke, where its elevated levels may serve as a 'damage control' mechanism (Novak2022The). However, in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, decreased ADAMTS4 expression is observed, and its administration worsens the condition, suggesting a complex role in neurodegeneration (Lemarchant2017ADAMTS‐4). In Alzheimer's disease, ADAMTS4 may exacerbate amyloid deposition and tau phosphorylation, potentially impacting disease progression (Lemarchant2017ADAMTS‐4). These findings highlight the diverse roles of ADAMTS4 in disease pathophysiology, suggesting it as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target.

## Interactions
ADAMTS4, also known as aggrecanase-1, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that influence its activity and function. It interacts with the cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), a substrate not cleaved by ADAMTS-5, highlighting its unique substrate specificity (Dennler2023Phylogenetic). ADAMTS4 also interacts with versican, a large extracellular matrix proteoglycan, and is more efficient in cleaving versican compared to ADAMTS-1 (Sandy2001Versican). 

The enzyme is known to interact with low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), which involves the cysteine-rich and spacer domains of ADAMTS4 (Dennler2023Phylogenetic). This interaction is significant for the internalization and regulation of ADAMTS4 activity (Dennler2023Phylogenetic). ADAMTS4 also interacts with tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 3 (TIMP3), which inhibits its proteolytic activity through its C-terminal domains (Dennler2023Phylogenetic).

In the context of cartilage degradation, ADAMTS4 is processed by MT4-MMP, which promotes its conversion to active forms that are crucial for aggrecanolysis (Patwari2005Analysis). These interactions and processing events underscore the role of ADAMTS4 in extracellular matrix remodeling and its potential implications in related pathologies.
