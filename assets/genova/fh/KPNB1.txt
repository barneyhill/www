# KPNB1

## Overview
KPNB1 is a gene that encodes the protein karyopherin subunit beta 1, also known as importin beta-1, which is a pivotal component of the nuclear transport system in eukaryotic cells. This protein is categorized as a nuclear transport receptor and is integral to the import of macromolecules from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. Karyopherin subunit beta 1 operates by recognizing nuclear localization signals (NLS) on cargo proteins and facilitating their passage through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) (Kelenis2022Inhibition). Structurally, the protein is characterized by 19 tandem HEAT repeats that form a flexible superhelix, enabling it to interact with various cargo proteins and partners such as RanGTP (Cingolani1999Structure; Christie2016Structural). KPNB1 is essential for numerous cellular processes, including the regulation of mitosis and the nuclear import of transcription factors, and it plays a significant role in both normal cellular function and disease states, particularly in cancer progression (Kelenis2022Inhibition; Okpara2022A).

## Structure
KPNB1, also known as importin beta-1, is a protein involved in the nuclear import of proteins in eukaryotic cells. The molecular structure of KPNB1 is characterized by 19 tandem HEAT repeats, which form a right-handed superhelix. These HEAT repeats are solenoid structures composed of A and B helices connected by short turns, contributing to the protein's flexible and elongated shape (Cingolani1999Structure; Christie2016Structural). The HEAT repeats are arranged in a superhelix with a convex face formed by A-helices and a concave face formed by B-helices, which is crucial for binding interactions with various cargo proteins and other partners like RanGTP (Christie2016Structural).

KPNB1 interacts with the importin-β-binding (IBB) domain of importin-α, forming a heterodimer that facilitates the nuclear import of proteins with a nuclear localization signal (NLS) (Cingolani1999Structure). The binding of the IBB domain involves HEAT repeats 7-19, with specific interactions between conserved residues such as Arg 13 and Lys 18 of the IBB domain and acidic residues on KPNB1 (Cingolani1999Structure). KPNB1 also undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which can influence its transport activity (Christie2016Structural).

## Function
Karyopherin subunit beta 1 (KPNB1) is a critical nuclear transport protein involved in the import of macromolecules from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in eukaryotic cells. It functions by recognizing nuclear localization signals (NLS) on cargo proteins, facilitating their passage through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) (Kelenis2022Inhibition). KPNB1 is essential for the nuclear import of various transcription factors, such as NEUROD1 and ASCL1, which are involved in gene transcription (Kelenis2022Inhibition). 

In healthy human cells, KPNB1 plays a significant role in regulating mitosis by controlling the assembly of the nuclear membrane, nuclear pores, and the mitotic spindle. It prevents inappropriate spindle assembly by sequestering spindle assembly factors in the cytoplasm and releasing them near chromosomes in a RanGTP-dependent manner (Kelenis2022Inhibition). KPNB1 also interacts with numerous proteins, including nuclear transport proteins like Ran and Kpnα2, and nuclear pore complex proteins such as Nup93, Nup214, Nup62, Nup98, and Nup188, highlighting its involvement in nuclear transport and RNA metabolism (Okpara2022A). These functions are crucial for maintaining cellular function and integrity in healthy human cells (Kelenis2022Inhibition).

## Clinical Significance
KPNB1 (karyopherin subunit beta 1) is implicated in several cancers due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In melanoma, KPNB1 is highly expressed and associated with poor survival outcomes. Its overexpression promotes tumor growth and metastasis by stabilizing G3BP1, a protein involved in stress granule formation, and by affecting pathways like AKT and STAT3, while reducing p53 expression. Targeting KPNB1 may enhance sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs like cisplatin (Yang2022Tumorpromoting).

In glioma, KPNB1 overexpression correlates with higher tumor grades and poor prognosis. It influences cell cycle progression and proliferation through the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, and its knockdown results in increased apoptosis and reduced tumor growth (Lu2016Karyopherinβ1; Li2024Stabilization).

KPNB1 is also upregulated in colorectal cancer, where it is linked to advanced disease stages and poor prognosis. It interacts with MET, a proto-oncogene, to promote metastasis (Zhang2019Karyopherin).

In epithelial ovarian cancer, KPNB1 acts as an oncogene, with its inhibition leading to increased apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. High KPNB1 expression is associated with earlier recurrence and worse prognosis (Kodama2017In).

These findings suggest that KPNB1 plays a significant role in cancer progression and could be a potential therapeutic target.

## Interactions
KPNB1, also known as importin beta-1, is a key nuclear transport receptor involved in the translocation of various proteins into the nucleus. It interacts directly with the PER proteins, facilitating the nuclear entry of the PER/CRY complex, which is crucial for circadian clock function. This interaction is independent of importin α, highlighting KPNB1's unique role in this process (Lee2015KPNB1). KPNB1 also plays a significant role in the nuclear import of NF-κB/p65, interacting with it in a nuclear localization signal (NLS)-dependent manner. This interaction is crucial for the activation of NF-κB signaling, particularly upon TNF-α stimulation (Liang2013KPNB1).

In cancer cells, KPNB1 exhibits enhanced interactions with several proteins, including Kpnα2, Ran, and CRM1, which are involved in nuclear transport. These interactions are more pronounced in cancer cells, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Okpara2022A). KPNB1 also interacts with PCDH1, promoting the nuclear import of p65 and activating the NF-κB pathway, which is associated with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma progression (Ye2022PCDH1). These interactions underscore KPNB1's critical role in both normal cellular processes and disease states.
