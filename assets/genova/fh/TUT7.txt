# TUT7

## Overview
TUT7, also known as ZCCHC6, is a gene that encodes the enzyme terminal uridylyl transferase 7, which is a member of the nucleotidyl transferase family. This enzyme is primarily involved in RNA processing, specifically in the uridylation of mRNAs and non-coding RNAs, marking them for degradation and thereby regulating RNA stability and turnover. TUT7 is characterized by its catalytic domain with nucleotidyl transferase activity and zinc finger motifs that facilitate RNA binding. It shares structural similarities with TUT4, including a nucleotidyl transferase domain and a poly(A) polymerase-associated domain, which are crucial for its enzymatic function (Kim2015TUT). The protein plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including mRNA decay, microRNA biogenesis, and immune response, and is predominantly active in the cytoplasm (Lim2014Uridylation). Alterations in TUT7 function have been linked to diseases such as cancer and inflammatory disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Lin2021Terminal).

## Structure
TUT7, also known as ZCCHC6, is a terminal uridylyl transferase involved in RNA processing. The protein structure includes a catalytic domain with nucleotidyl transferase activity and zinc finger motifs for RNA binding. TUT7 shares a common catalytic motif with TUT4, consisting of a nucleotidyl transferase (Ntr) domain and a poly(A) polymerase-associated (PAP) domain. The Ntr domain contains three catalytic aspartates, while the PAP domain provides nucleotide specificity (Kim2015TUT). TUT7 has a duplication of the catalytic motif at its N-terminus, which is inactive due to the absence of one catalytic aspartate. The protein also features a CCHH zinc finger motif at the N-terminus and three CCHC zinc finger motifs around the catalytic motif (Kim2015TUT).

The C-terminal half of TUT7, encompassing residues 951-1,495, is critical for its mono-uridylation activity, indicating the importance of this region for its enzymatic function (Kim2015TUT). TUT7 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, and splice variants can result in different isoforms with distinct functional properties. These structural features enable TUT7 to recognize specific RNA structures, such as the terminal loop and overhang, influencing its uridylation activity (Kim2015TUT).

## Function
TUT7, or terminal uridylyl transferase 7, is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in RNA processing in human cells. It is primarily involved in the uridylation of mRNAs and non-coding RNAs, marking them for degradation. TUT7, along with TUT4, adds uridine residues to the 3' end of mRNAs, particularly those with short poly(A) tails, facilitating their decay and thus regulating mRNA turnover and stability (Lim2014Uridylation). This process is essential for maintaining proper gene expression and cellular homeostasis.

TUT7 is also involved in the regulation of microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis. It monouridylates precursor miRNAs, such as the let-7 family, promoting their processing by Dicer and increasing mature miRNA levels (Menezes20183′). This activity is crucial for the differentiation and tumor-suppressive functions of miRNAs (Zigáčková2018The).

In addition to its role in RNA decay, TUT7 is implicated in the immune response by uridylating viral RNAs and LINE-1 mRNAs, contributing to the defense against genomic invasion (Yashiro2018Function). TUT7 is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, where it participates in various cellular processes, including mRNA turnover and noncoding RNA quality control (Lim2014Uridylation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of TUT7 (terminal uridylyl transferase 7) have been implicated in various diseases, particularly those involving inflammation and cancer. TUT7 plays a significant role in regulating inflammation by controlling the uridylation and degradation of Regnase-1 mRNA, which in turn affects the stability of cytokine mRNAs such as IL-6. Dysregulation of TUT7 can lead to altered inflammatory responses, potentially contributing to inflammatory and autoimmune diseases (Lin2021Terminal).

In the context of cancer, TUT7, along with TUT4, is involved in the regulation of let-7 microRNA biogenesis. The let-7 family of microRNAs is crucial for cell differentiation and proliferation, and its dysregulation is associated with tumorigenesis. TUT7, through its interaction with Lin28, facilitates the uridylation of pre-let-7, repressing its maturation and contributing to cancer progression by maintaining low levels of mature let-7 (Thornton2012Lin28-mediated; Yamashita2019Crystal). The repression of let-7 is significant in embryonic and cancer cells, where Lin28 is expressed, and contributes to tumorigenesis by preventing the repression of several oncogenes (Yashiro2018Function).

## Interactions
TUT7, also known as ZCCHC6, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence RNA processing. It interacts with precursor microRNAs (pre-miRNAs), recognizing structural elements such as the 3' overhang and terminal loop, which are crucial for its uridylation activity (Kim2015TUT). TUT7, along with its paralogues TUT4 and TUT2, participates in the uridylation of pre-let-7 miRNAs, a process regulated by the RNA-binding protein Lin28. This interaction prevents the processing of pre-let-7 into mature miRNA, leading to its degradation (Kim2015TUT; Thornton2012Lin28-mediated).

TUT7 also interacts with histone mRNAs, where it collaborates with 3' hExo to facilitate their degradation. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the proper length of histone mRNAs and involves the recruitment of other components like SLBP and Upf1 (Lackey2016TUT7). In the context of mRNA uridylation, TUT7 works redundantly with TUT4 to add uridine residues to mRNAs, marking them for degradation (Lim2014Uridylation). These interactions highlight TUT7's role in RNA stability and degradation across different RNA species.
