This protein is a member of the ABC1 subfamily. Members of the ABC1 subfamily comprise the only major ABC subfamily found exclusively in multicellular eukaryotes. With cholesterol as its substrate, this protein functions as a cholesteral efflux pump in the cellular lipid removal pathway. Mutations in both alleles of this gene cause Tangier disease and familial high-density lipoprotein (HDL) deficiency.
