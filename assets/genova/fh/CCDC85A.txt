# CCDC85A

## Overview
CCDC85A is a gene that encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 85A protein, which is characterized by its coiled-coil structural motifs. These motifs are integral to the protein's ability to engage in protein-protein interactions, playing a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. The CCDC85A protein is involved in the regulation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways by interacting with molecular chaperones and transmembrane proteins, thereby influencing cell survival under stress conditions. Additionally, the gene is subject to regulation by microRNAs, such as miR-224-3p, which modulate its expression and function in cancer cell resistance to chemotherapy. CCDC85A has also been implicated in neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and idiopathic epilepsy in certain dog breeds, highlighting its clinical significance in both oncological and neurological contexts (Takahashi2023CCDC85A; Aladeokin2019Networkguided; Beckers2023Identification).

## Structure
The CCDC85A gene encodes a protein characterized by the presence of coiled-coil domains, which are structural motifs formed by alpha-helices wound around each other. These domains are crucial for facilitating protein-protein interactions, which are essential for the protein's involvement in various cellular processes. The coiled-coil structure contributes to the protein's stability and functional specificity.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur in the CCDC85A protein. These modifications can influence the protein's function and its interactions with other cellular components, potentially altering its role in cellular processes. The presence of phosphorylation sites suggests regulatory mechanisms that modulate the protein's activity in response to cellular signals.

CCDC85A also exhibits splice variant isoforms, which contribute to structural and functional diversity within the protein family. These isoforms can lead to variations in the protein's structure, potentially affecting its interaction capabilities and functional roles within the cell. The existence of multiple isoforms underscores the complexity and adaptability of the CCDC85A protein in fulfilling its cellular functions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CCDC85A gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and neurological disorders. In cancer, CCDC85A is associated with resistance to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, in gastric and pancreatic cancers. The gene is regulated by miR-224-3p, and its downregulation increases cancer cell susceptibility to ER stress and apoptosis, suggesting its role in promoting cancer cell survival and therapy resistance (Takahashi2023CCDC85A; Battaglia2023Editorial:).

In neurological contexts, a variant in the CCDC85A gene has been identified as a risk factor for idiopathic epilepsy in Dutch Partridge Dogs, with a significant difference in allele frequency between affected and unaffected dogs. This variant is classified as likely pathogenic, although its role in human epilepsy remains uncertain due to limited functional evidence (Beckers2023Identification).

Additionally, CCDC85A has been found to be upregulated in the hippocampus of a mouse model of early-stage Alzheimer's disease, where it colocalizes with amyloid-beta, suggesting a potential role in the metabolic clearance of amyloid-beta and a compensatory response to rising levels of this protein (Aladeokin2019Networkguided).

## Interactions
CCDC85A is involved in several protein-protein interactions, particularly within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. It forms complexes with molecular chaperones GRP78 and GRP94, and interacts with the N-terminal region of the transmembrane protein PERK in the ER lumen. This interaction disrupts the binding of GRP78 and GRP94 to PERK, which is essential for the activation of the PERK-mediated unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways. Overexpression of CCDC85A interferes with the interaction between PERK and these chaperones, promoting sustained activation of PERK and downstream signaling, which assists in cell survival under ER stress (Takahashi2023CCDC85A; Tanaka2022CCDC85A).

CCDC85A is also regulated by miR-224-3p, which affects its expression and role in cancer cell resistance to ER stress and chemotherapeutic agents like cisplatin (Takahashi2023CCDC85A). In the context of Alzheimer's disease, CCDC85A is upregulated in the hippocampus of a mouse model and may play a role in the metabolism of amyloid-beta (Aβ), although specific interactions in this context are not detailed (Aladeokin2019Networkguided).
