# SLC2A10

## Overview
The SLC2A10 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 2 member 10, commonly referred to as GLUT10, which is a member of the facilitative glucose transporter family. This protein is characterized by its 12 transmembrane domains, which are integral to its function in transporting glucose and dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) across cellular membranes (Lin2006Association; Coucke2006Mutations). GLUT10 plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis by facilitating the uptake of DHA into mitochondria, where it is converted to ascorbate, thus protecting cells from oxidative stress (Lee2010Mitochondrial). The protein is predominantly expressed in aortic smooth muscle cells and white adipose tissues, where it also influences the regulation of genes involved in adipogenesis and the stability of the extracellular matrix (Jiang2020Glucose; Zimmermann2018Assessing). Mutations in SLC2A10 are linked to arterial tortuosity syndrome, a connective tissue disorder characterized by the elongation and tortuosity of arteries (Ritelli2014Arterial; Callewaert2008Arterial).

## Structure
The SLC2A10 gene encodes the GLUT10 protein, a member of the facilitative glucose transporter family. The primary structure of GLUT10 consists of 541 amino acids, forming a protein with 12 transmembrane domains, which is typical of the glucose transporter family (Lin2006Association; Coucke2006Mutations). These transmembrane domains are crucial for its function in glucose transport, with specific residues important for substrate recognition and transport specificity (Chiarelli2011Characterization).

The secondary structure of GLUT10 includes alpha helices that span the membrane, forming a channel for glucose transport. The tertiary structure involves the arrangement of these helices into two bundles of six helices each, creating a channel that facilitates glucose transport (Zimmermann2018Assessing). The protein also features a hydrophilic intracellular loop between helices 6 and 7 and a large extracellular loop with a potential N-linked glycosylation site between helices 9 and 10, which may influence protein stability and function (Lin2006Association).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are suggested to play a role in the protein's stability and function, although specific details are not extensively covered in the available literature (Lin2006Association). The protein's quaternary structure and potential interactions with other proteins are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
The SLC2A10 gene encodes the glucose transporter 10 (GLUT10), which is primarily involved in the transport of dehydroascorbic acid (DHA), the oxidized form of vitamin C, into mitochondria. This transport is crucial for maintaining cellular redox homeostasis by reducing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and protecting cells against oxidative stress (Lee2010Mitochondrial). GLUT10 is highly expressed in aortic smooth muscle cells and white adipose tissues, where it facilitates the conversion of DHA to ascorbate within mitochondria, enhancing antioxidant defenses (Lee2010Mitochondrial).

In healthy cells, GLUT10's role extends to modulating intracellular and nuclear ascorbic acid levels, which influences the activity of ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes involved in DNA demethylation. This process is important for the regulation of genes critical for adipogenesis, such as Cebpa and Pparg, thereby supporting normal white adipose tissue development and metabolic function (Jiang2020Glucose). GLUT10 is also implicated in maintaining the stability of the extracellular matrix by acting as an enzymatic cofactor for collagen and elastin-stabilizing hydroxylases, which is essential for preventing connective tissue disorders like arterial tortuosity syndrome (Zimmermann2018Assessing).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC2A10 gene, which encodes the glucose transporter GLUT10, are primarily associated with arterial tortuosity syndrome (ATS), a rare autosomal recessive connective tissue disorder. ATS is characterized by the elongation and tortuosity of large and medium-sized arteries, leading to a predisposition for aneurysm formation, dissections, and ischemic events. Clinical manifestations of ATS include dysmorphic features, soft hyperextensible skin, skeletal abnormalities, and severe cardiopulmonary complications, often presenting in infancy or early childhood (Ritelli2014Arterial; Callewaert2008Arterial).

The pathogenesis of ATS involves the disruption of elastic fibers in the arterial wall due to mutations in SLC2A10, which result in the upregulation of the TGF-β signaling pathway. This disruption affects the proper formation of the extracellular matrix, particularly elastogenesis, and is similar to mechanisms observed in Loeys-Dietz syndrome (Coucke2006Mutations). Despite the gene's role in glucose transport, no direct link between SLC2A10 mutations and diabetes has been established (Callewaert2008Arterial; Coucke2006Mutations).

Alterations in SLC2A10 expression have also been implicated in lung adenocarcinoma, where downregulated levels are associated with poor prognosis and increased tumor aggressiveness (Zhang2022SLC2As).
