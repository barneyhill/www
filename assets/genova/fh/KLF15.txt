# KLF15

## Overview
KLF15 (Krüppel-like factor 15) is a gene that encodes a zinc finger transcription factor belonging to the Krüppel-like factor family. This protein is characterized by its three C2H2 zinc finger domains, which facilitate its binding to specific DNA sequences, thereby regulating the transcription of various genes. KLF15 plays a pivotal role in metabolic processes, including glucose and lipid metabolism, particularly during fasting states. It is involved in the regulation of insulin sensitivity, glucose uptake, and lipid utilization, and is essential for exercise adaptation in skeletal muscle. Additionally, KLF15 interacts with several proteins and pathways, influencing cardiac function and gene regulation. Its expression is modulated by circadian rhythms, which are crucial for maintaining metabolic homeostasis. Clinically, KLF15 has been implicated in conditions such as colorectal cancer, cardiac hypertrophy, and breast cancer, where its altered expression or function can contribute to disease progression (Kanyomse2022KLF15; Haldar2010Klf15; Cao2024KLF15; Hsieh2018The).

## Structure
KLF15 (KLF transcription factor 15) is a member of the Krüppel-like factor family, characterized by the presence of three C2H2 zinc finger domains at its C-terminus, which are crucial for its DNA binding function (Otteson2005Zincfinger). These zinc finger domains allow KLF15 to bind to specific DNA sequences, including a 9 bp consensus sequence with a core CG/TCCCC, in the promoters of genes such as rhodopsin and IRBP (Otteson2005Zincfinger). The zinc-finger domains are modular DNA binding motifs, and their structure and function depend on the presence of zinc ions, as demonstrated by the reduction in DNA binding upon zinc chelation (Otteson2005Zincfinger).

The primary structure of KLF15 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form these zinc finger domains, which are composed of Cys2-His2 residues responsible for chelating zinc ions (Otteson2005Zincfinger). While specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not provided, the zinc finger domains typically form a characteristic fold that facilitates DNA interaction. Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may influence KLF15's function, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. The presence of splice variant isoforms is not mentioned in the context.

## Function
KLF15 (KLF transcription factor 15) is a crucial regulator of various metabolic processes in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in glucose and lipid metabolism, particularly during fasting. In the fasted state, KLF15 increases the expression of acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase 2, a mitochondrial enzyme that produces acetyl-coenzyme A for the Krebs cycle, and mediates protein catabolism in skeletal muscle to provide amino acids for gluconeogenesis in the liver (Pollak2018Krüppel-Like). KLF15 also regulates insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake by enhancing the transcription of the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter GLUT4 in adipocytes and myocytes (Hsieh2018The).

In skeletal muscle, KLF15 is essential for lipid utilization and exercise adaptation, helping muscles shift from carbohydrate to lipid utilization during endurance exercise, thus sparing glucose for the brain (Haldar2012Kruppellike). It is also involved in regulating hepatic gluconeogenesis and amino acid catabolism, coordinating with PGC-1α to initiate transcription of key gluconeogenic enzymes (Hsieh2018The). KLF15's expression is influenced by circadian rhythms, which are crucial for coordinating nutrient handling and maintaining metabolic homeostasis (Hsieh2018The).

## Clinical Significance
KLF15 has been implicated in various diseases due to mutations, altered expression levels, or disrupted interactions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), KLF15 is downregulated, which affects its role as a transcriptional activator of LINC00689, a long non-coding RNA that inhibits CRC progression. Overexpression of KLF15 in CRC cells reduces their proliferative, migratory, and invasive abilities by suppressing the YAP1/β-catenin signaling pathway, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for CRC diagnosis and prognosis (Cao2024KLF15).

In cardiac health, KLF15 acts as a repressor of cardiac hypertrophy. Genetic variations in KLF15, such as the rs9838915 A allele, are associated with increased left ventricular mass and a higher risk of heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes (Patel2017Genetic). KLF15 also inhibits myocardin activity, and its downregulation is linked to pathological cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure (Leenders2010Regulation).

In breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), KLF15 functions as a tumor suppressor. Its expression is often reduced due to promoter methylation, leading to increased tumor growth and metastasis. Overexpression of KLF15 in TNBC cells inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Kanyomse2022KLF15).

## Interactions
KLF15 (Kruppel-like factor 15) is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cardiac function and gene regulation. KLF15 interacts with components of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, including β-catenin, NLK, and TCF4. It promotes the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of TCF4, thereby regulating Wnt/β-catenin transcriptional activity in cardiac cells (Noack2012Krueppel‐like).

KLF15 also interacts with myocardin, a transcriptional coactivator of the serum response factor (SRF), inhibiting its activity by binding to a region that overlaps with the SRF binding domain. This interaction prevents myocardin from activating SRF-dependent genes, which is crucial for repressing cardiac hypertrophy (Leenders2010Regulation).

In cardiac fibroblasts, KLF15 inhibits the expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) by preventing the recruitment of the transcriptional coactivator P/CAF to the CTGF promoter, thus modulating TGFβ1-induced transcriptional activity (Wang2008The).

KLF15 also interacts with p300, a histone acetyltransferase, to regulate p53 acetylation, thereby influencing p53's transcriptional activity and stability. This interaction is crucial for maintaining cardiovascular health, as KLF15 deficiency leads to increased p53 acetylation and associated pathologies (Haldar2010Klf15).
