# CEP57L1

## Overview
CEP57L1 is a gene that encodes the centrosomal protein 57 like 1, a crucial component involved in centriole duplication and engagement within the centrosome. This protein functions as a molecular scaffold, facilitating the recruitment of the Cep63-Cep152 complex to the proximal end of centrioles, which is essential for maintaining genome integrity and proper cell division (Zhao2020Cep57; Zhao2019Cep57). Unlike its paralog Cep57, CEP57L1 does not bind microtubules but instead localizes independently to the centrosome, where it plays a vital role in centriole engagement and spindle formation (Ito2020Cep57). Mutations in the CEP57L1 gene have been linked to congenital musculoskeletal disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in ligament development and stability (Liu2015Copy).

## Structure
The CEP57L1 protein is characterized by a coiled-coil domain spanning residues 51 to 228, which is crucial for its function (Liu2015Copy). The N-terminus, specifically residues 1 to 18, may form an α-helical structure, as suggested by modeling with PEP-FOLD (Liu2015Copy). The 3D structure of CEP57L1 was modeled using Phyre2, providing a high-confidence prediction of its molecular structure (Liu2015Copy).

The C-terminus of CEP57L1 is responsible for bundling and nucleating microtubules in vivo through binding interactions (Liu2015Copy). The N-terminus, containing the coiled-coil domain, interacts with the centrosome and can multimerize with other CEP57 structures (Liu2015Copy). This multimerization is essential for its role in centriole biogenesis, where it acts redundantly with Cep57 to recruit the Cep63-Cep152 complex to the proximal end of centrioles (Zhao2020Cep57).

The protein's ability to interact with other cellular components is significantly compromised when 96% of CEP57L1 is absent due to exon deletion, affecting its functional capabilities (Liu2015Copy). The structural analysis suggests that these deletions impact the protein's interaction with cellular components.

## Function
CEP57L1 encodes a centrosomal protein involved in several critical cellular functions, particularly in centriole duplication and engagement. It acts as a molecular scaffold, recruiting the Cep63-Cep152 complex to the proximal end of centrioles, which is essential for centriole duplication. This process is crucial for maintaining genome integrity, as aberrations can lead to tumors and diseases (Zhao2020Cep57; Zhao2019Cep57). CEP57L1, along with its paralog Cep57, ensures proper centriole engagement during interphase, preventing premature centriole disengagement and reduplication, which can lead to numerical centrosome abnormalities and chromosome segregation errors (Ito2020Cep57).

CEP57L1 is localized at the centrosome and interacts with proteins such as Cep63, playing a role in the torus pathway for centriole engagement. This pathway is distinct from the pericentriolar material (PCM) pathway and is essential for maintaining the orthogonal engagement of mother-daughter centrioles during interphase (Ito2024Multimodal). The protein's activity in the centrosome is vital for proper spindle formation and chromosome segregation, contributing to genomic stability in healthy human cells (Ito2020Cep57).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CEP57L1 gene have been associated with the congenital absence of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), a rare condition that leads to knee joint instability. A study identified a copy number variation (CNV) deletion in the CEP57L1 gene, which was found in affected individuals but absent in healthy controls and other rare disease cohorts, suggesting a unique association with ACL/PCL absence (Liu2015Copy). This CNV deletion results in reduced expression of CEP57L1, leading to approximately half the amount of functional mRNA compared to controls, which impacts the protein's ability to perform its functions, such as microtubule bundling and interaction with the centrosome (Liu2015Copy).

The inheritance pattern of this CNV deletion is autosomal dominant, as it was observed to be passed from an affected mother to her daughter, indicating a genetic predisposition to the condition (Liu2015Copy). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of CEP57L1 in musculoskeletal disorders, particularly in the context of ligament development and stability (Liu2015Copy).

## Interactions
CEP57L1 is involved in several key interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of centriole duplication and centrosome function. It acts as a molecular scaffold, similar to its paralog Cep57, to recruit the Cep63-Cep152 complex to the proximal end of centrioles. The N-terminus of CEP57L1 is necessary and sufficient for binding to Cep63, which interacts with CEP57L1 through its N-terminal centrosomal targeting fragment. This interaction forms a ring-like structure with Cep63 and Cep152 at the proximal end of centrioles (Zhao2020Cep57).

CEP57L1 also plays a role in maintaining centriole engagement during interphase, working cooperatively with Cep57. Co-depletion of both proteins leads to precocious centriole disengagement and reduplication, resulting in numerical centrosome abnormalities and potential chromosome segregation errors (Ito2020Cep57).

Despite its high sequence homology with Cep57, CEP57L1 does not bind microtubules and instead aggregates in the cytoplasm. It localizes to the centrosome independently and exhibits self-interaction, as shown by co-immunoprecipitation assays (Ito2020Cep57). These interactions highlight CEP57L1's distinct yet overlapping roles with Cep57 in centrosome and centriole dynamics.
