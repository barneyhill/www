# GPR22

## Overview
GPR22 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 22, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is characterized by its role in transmembrane signaling. This receptor is involved in various physiological processes, particularly within the cardiovascular and neurological systems. GPR22 is expressed in several tissues, and its expression levels have been linked to conditions such as cardiovascular diseases and neurodegenerative disorders. In the cardiovascular system, GPR22 plays a protective role by modulating signaling pathways that influence cell survival and stress responses (Chang2024Cardiomyocytespecific). In the neurological context, alterations in GPR22 expression have been associated with Alzheimer's disease, indicating its potential involvement in neurodegenerative processes (Chang2024Cardiomyocytespecific). Additionally, GPR22 has been implicated in phenotypic variations, such as coat color in Poodles, due to its regulatory effects on pigment production pathways (Batcher2022An). These diverse roles highlight the significance of GPR22 in both health and disease.

## Clinical Significance
GPR22, a G protein-coupled receptor, has been implicated in various cardiovascular and neurological conditions due to alterations in its expression levels. In the context of cardiovascular diseases, GPR22 expression is notably reduced in the myocardium of rodents experiencing ventricular pressure overload and diabetes, suggesting a negative correlation with cardiac stress (Chang2024Cardiomyocytespecific). Overexpression of GPR22 in cardiomyocytes has been shown to ameliorate cardiac injury in mice with acute myocardial infarction by regulating apoptosis-associated proteins and activating PI3K/Akt signaling, which are involved in cell survival pathways (Chang2024Cardiomyocytespecific). This indicates a potential protective role of GPR22 against cardiac injury and highlights its therapeutic potential in managing cardiac stress and injury (Chang2024Cardiomyocytespecific).

In neurological contexts, GPR22 expression is decreased in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients, suggesting a possible link to neurodegenerative diseases (Chang2024Cardiomyocytespecific). The gene's expression is also associated with coat color variation in Poodles, where a retrocopy insertion upstream of GPR22 leads to its ectopic expression in skin tissue, affecting pigment production pathways (Batcher2022An). These findings underscore the diverse roles of GPR22 in both cardiac and neurological health.
