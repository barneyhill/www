# ZZZ3

## Overview
The ZZZ3 gene encodes the zinc finger ZZ-type containing 3 protein, which is integral to various cellular processes, particularly in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). This protein is a component of the Ada2A-containing (ATAC) histone acetyltransferase complex, where it functions as a histone H3 reader, specifically binding to acetylated histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4ac). This interaction facilitates chromatin association and histone acetylation, influencing gene expression and playing a critical role in ribosome biogenesis, DNA replication, and cell cycle regulation (Zhang2019The). Additionally, ZZZ3 is involved in protecting hESCs from nucleolar stress by enhancing the mTOR/ribosome pathway, which is essential for maintaining cell proliferation and growth (Conte2023ZZZ3). The protein's interactions with ribosomal proteins and its co-localization with fibrillarin in the nucleolus underscore its role in ribosome assembly and function (Conte2023ZZZ3). Alterations in ZZZ3 expression have implications for cellular stress responses and growth-related pathways, highlighting its significance in cellular homeostasis (Conte2023ZZZ3).

## Function
The ZZZ3 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in protecting human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) from nucleolar stress by enhancing the mTOR/ribosome pathway. This protein is involved in ribosome biogenesis, rRNA processing, and translation, which are essential for maintaining cell proliferation and growth. ZZZ3 interacts with ribosomal proteins and co-localizes in the nucleolus with fibrillarin, a protein important for pre-rRNA processing and ribosome assembly (Conte2023ZZZ3).

ZZZ3 is a component of the Ada2A-containing (ATAC) histone acetyltransferase complex, where it functions as a histone H3 reader. It specifically binds to the acetylated form of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4ac), facilitating chromatin association and promoting histone acetylation, which influences gene expression (Zhang2019The). The protein's activity is crucial for the regulation of genes associated with ribosome biogenesis, DNA replication, and the cell cycle (Zhang2019The).

In hESCs, ZZZ3 supports the mTOR/ribosome pathway, ensuring efficient ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis, which are interconnected with cell growth and proliferation (Conte2023ZZZ3). Its depletion leads to nucleolar stress and activation of the p53 checkpoint, indicating its essential role in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Conte2023ZZZ3).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ZZZ3 gene have been implicated in conditions related to dysregulated cell growth and stress responses. ZZZ3 is a component of the ATAC complex, which plays a crucial role in gene expression regulation by binding to acetylated histone H3, specifically H3K4ac. This interaction is essential for maintaining acetylation at target genes, and its disruption can lead to reduced acetylation marks, impacting cell growth-related pathways such as ribosome biogenesis and DNA replication (Zhang2019The). 

In human embryonic stem cells, ZZZ3 is involved in protecting cells from nucleolar stress by enhancing the mTOR/ribosome pathway. Knockdown of ZZZ3 impairs ribosome biogenesis and translation, leading to the activation of p53, a protein associated with cellular stress responses. This impairment results in reduced cell proliferation and a more dispersed nucleolar structure, indicating nucleolar stress (Conte2023ZZZ3). The downregulation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway in ZZZ3-depleted cells further suggests its role in maintaining normal cell proliferation and ribosome biogenesis (Conte2023ZZZ3). These findings imply that alterations in ZZZ3 expression could potentially impact conditions related to cell growth and stress responses, although specific diseases are not directly addressed in the available context.

## Interactions
The ZZZ3 protein is a component of the Ada2A-containing (ATAC) histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex, where it plays a crucial role in chromatin association and transcriptional regulation. It contains a ZZ domain that specifically binds to the acetylated form of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4ac), facilitating histone acetylation, particularly at H3K9 (Zhang2019The; Longbotham2020Domain). This interaction is essential for the ATAC complex's enzymatic activity, as disruption of the ZZ-H3 interaction reduces acetylation and target gene expression (Longbotham2020Domain).

In human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), ZZZ3 interacts with ribosomal proteins and co-localizes in the nucleolus with fibrillarin, a protein involved in pre-rRNA processing and ribosome assembly. This suggests a role in ribosome biogenesis and nucleolar function (Conte2023ZZZ3). ZZZ3 also interacts with components of the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits, such as RPS8, RPS15, RPS15A, RPL27, RPL27A, and RPL36 (Conte2023ZZZ3).

Additionally, ZZZ3 has been shown to interact with the Xist RNA in mouse embryonic stem cells, playing a role in X-chromosome inactivation (XCI). Depletion of ZZZ3 leads to reduced silencing of the X-linked gene Lamp2 during XCI initiation (Graindorge2019Incell).
