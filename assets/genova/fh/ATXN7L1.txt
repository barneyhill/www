# ATXN7L1

## Overview
ATXN7L1 (ataxin 7 like 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling, primarily as a component of the SAGA (SPT3-TAF9-GCN5 acetyltransferase) complex. The protein ataxin 7 like 1, encoded by ATXN7L1, is categorized as a nuclear protein that plays a significant role in histone modification, thereby influencing gene expression. It shares structural similarities with its paralogs ATXN7 and ATXN7L2, suggesting potential functional redundancy, particularly in the context of the SAGA complex's histone deubiquitinase module (DUBm) (Helmlinger2017Sharing). The protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including DNA repair and transcription, and is associated with several clinical conditions, such as type 2 diabetes and severe acne, highlighting its importance in both normal cellular function and disease (Du2023Genomewide; Felício2023Functional).

## Function
ATXN7L1 (ataxin 7 like 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling as part of the SAGA (SPT3-TAF9-GCN5 acetyltransferase) complex. This complex is crucial for modifying histones, which in turn regulates gene expression. ATXN7L1, along with its paralogs ATXN7 and ATXN7L2, can be incorporated into the SAGA complex's histone deubiquitinase module (DUBm), although their presence is mutually exclusive, meaning only one can be part of the module at a time (Helmlinger2017Sharing). 

ATXN7L1 shares three conserved regions with ATXN7, suggesting a high degree of homology and potential functional redundancy. It is thought to compensate for the partial loss of ATXN7 function within the SAGA complex, particularly during later stages of erythroid cell development, where it may substitute for ATXN7 and ATXN7L2 in the STAGA's DUBm complex (Felício2023Functional). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it influences cellular processes such as DNA repair and transcription, contributing to the maintenance of normal cellular functions and development (Felício2023Functional). Despite its involvement in these critical processes, the specific functions and interactions of ATXN7L1 in healthy human cells remain not fully characterized (Felício2023Functional).

## Clinical Significance
The ATXN7L1 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in transcriptional regulation and its homology with ataxin-7, which is associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7). Alterations in ATXN7L1 expression have been linked to type 2 diabetes, as the gene shows a high evidence of association with this condition. This connection is consistent with studies linking acne vulgaris and type 2 diabetes mellitus as mTORC1-driven metabolic diseases (Du2023Genomewide).

ATXN7L1 is also associated with severe acne risk, particularly among African ancestry populations. A genome-wide association study identified a significant locus at 7q22.3, with the lead variant rs115325598 located in the intron region of ATXN7L1, showing a strong association with severe acne (Du2023Genomewide). The gene is upregulated in the skin tissue of atopic dermatitis patients and downregulated in epidermal keratinocyte cells in psoriasis vulgaris patients, indicating its involvement in skin-related conditions (Du2023Genomewide).

Additionally, ATXN7L1 may play a role in the neuropathology of polyglutamine spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), potentially compensating for the dysfunction of its paralog ATXN7 in the SAGA complex, although its specific clinical significance in SCAs remains uncharacterized (Felício2023Functional).
