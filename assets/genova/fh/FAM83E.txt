# FAM83E

## Overview
FAM83E is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the FAM83 family, which is characterized by the presence of a DUF1669 domain. This domain is notable for its pseudo-phospholipase D (PLD)-like catalytic motif, which, despite lacking actual catalytic activity, plays a crucial role in mediating interactions with casein kinase 1 (CK1) isoforms, such as CK1α and CK1ε (Bozatzi2018The; Fulcher2018The). The FAM83E protein is involved in the subcellular localization of these kinases, suggesting a regulatory function in cellular processes (Fulcher2018The). While the complete molecular architecture of FAM83E remains to be fully elucidated, its role in cancer biology, particularly in the context of gene expression and prognosis, has been a focus of research (Yuan2022Pan-cancer). The gene's expression levels have been linked to oncogenic processes, making it a potential biomarker for certain cancer types (Yuan2022Pan-cancer).

## Structure
The FAM83E protein is a member of the FAM83 family, characterized by the presence of the DUF1669 domain at the N-terminus. This domain contains a pseudo-phospholipase D (PLD)-like catalytic motif, but it lacks the essential elements for actual PLD catalytic activity, classifying it as a pseudo-PLD (Bozatzi2018The). The DUF1669 domain is crucial for mediating interactions with casein kinase 1 (CK1) isoforms, particularly CK1α and CK1ε, and plays a significant role in the subcellular localization of these kinases (Fulcher2018The).

The primary structure of FAM83E, like other FAM83 proteins, includes unique amino acid sequences outside the DUF1669 domain, which are predicted to be non-globular and disordered (Bozatzi2018The). The tertiary structure of FAM83E is not fully understood, and further structural analysis is needed to elucidate its complete molecular architecture (Bozatzi2018The). There is no detailed information available on the secondary or quaternary structures of FAM83E, nor on specific post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms. The DUF1669 domain's role as an anchor for CK1 isoforms suggests a regulatory function in cellular processes, although the exact mechanisms remain to be fully explored (Bozatzi2018The).

## Clinical Significance
FAM83E is a gene that has been studied for its role in cancer, particularly in relation to its expression levels and potential impact on prognosis. In various cancers, the FAM83E gene is generally upregulated, which is a common characteristic of the FAM83 family of genes. However, in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), low expression of FAM83E is associated with a favorable prognosis, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker in this cancer type (Yuan2022Pan-cancer).

The FAM83E gene has also been implicated in the transformation of human mammary epithelial cells, indicating its role in cancer development and progression (Yuan2022Pan-cancer). While mutations in FAM83E are not frequently discussed, alterations in its expression levels are significant in the context of cancer prognosis and may influence tumor behavior and patient outcomes.

The broader FAM83 family, to which FAM83E belongs, is known for its involvement in oncogenic processes across various cancers, often through DNA copy number alterations that lead to changes in gene expression (Snijders2017FAM83). However, specific diseases or conditions directly resulting from mutations in FAM83E are not detailed in the available literature.
