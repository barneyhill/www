# NR1I3

## Overview
The NR1I3 gene encodes the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), a member of the nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group I. CAR is a nuclear receptor that functions as a transcription factor, primarily expressed in the liver, where it plays a crucial role in the regulation of genes involved in drug metabolism and detoxification processes. The protein is characterized by its ability to form heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), facilitating its binding to specific DNA sequences and subsequent activation of gene transcription. CAR is involved in the regulation of cytochrome P450 enzymes, which are essential for the metabolism of various drugs and xenobiotic substances. Beyond its role in drug metabolism, CAR also influences energy homeostasis and lipid metabolism, impacting conditions such as diabetes and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (Pascussi2003Transcriptional; Maglich2009The). The activity of CAR is modulated by various ligands, coactivators, and repressors, highlighting its complex regulatory mechanisms (Handschin2003Induction).

## Structure
The human gene NR1I3 encodes the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), a nuclear receptor involved in the regulation of genes related to drug metabolism. The CAR protein is primarily expressed in the liver and consists of several key domains: a DNA-binding domain (DBD), a hinge domain, and a ligand-binding/dimerization/transcriptional activation domain (Auerbach2003Alternatively). The DBD is characterized by zinc finger motifs, which facilitate binding to specific DNA sequences as a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) (Auerbach2003Alternatively).

The ligand-binding domain (LBD) of CAR spans amino acids 102-348 and is crucial for its interaction with ligands and coregulators (Auerbach2003Alternatively). Structural modeling of the LBD, based on homologous structures like the vitamin D receptor, reveals that CAR's LBD includes specific helices and loops that form a ligand-binding pocket (Auerbach2003Alternatively). 

Alternative splicing of NR1I3 results in several isoforms with distinct structural features. For example, the CAR3 isoform includes a five-amino acid insertion in the LBD, altering its ligand-binding properties and making it a ligand-dependent transactivator (Auerbach2005Retinoid). These isoforms exhibit variations in their ability to bind DNA and recruit coactivators, impacting their functional roles in gene regulation (Auerbach2003Alternatively).

## Function
The NR1I3 gene encodes the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), a nuclear receptor that plays a significant role in the regulation of genes involved in drug metabolism and detoxification processes. CAR is primarily active in the liver, where it regulates the expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4, which are crucial for the metabolism of drugs and xenobiotic chemicals (Moore2000Orphan; Pascussi2003Transcriptional). 

CAR functions as a ligand-activated transcription factor, forming a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) to bind specific DNA elements and activate gene transcription (Handschin2003Induction). It is sequestered in the cytoplasm and translocates to the nucleus upon activation, a process regulated by phosphorylation (Kawamoto1999PhenobarbitalResponsive). 

In addition to its role in drug metabolism, CAR is involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis and lipid metabolism. It has been shown to influence serum triglyceride levels under metabolic stress conditions, suggesting a role in modulating lipid metabolism and potentially impacting conditions like diabetes and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (Maglich2009The). The activity of CAR is modulated by various coactivators and repressors, highlighting its complex regulatory mechanisms (Handschin2003Induction).

## Clinical Significance
The NR1I3 gene, encoding the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), plays a significant role in various diseases due to its involvement in drug metabolism and energy homeostasis. Alterations in CAR expression are linked to systemic sclerosis (SSc), where it is upregulated in skin fibroblasts, enhancing the profibrotic effects of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) and contributing to dermal fibrosis (Avouac2014The). In metabolic disorders, CAR activation has been shown to ameliorate type 2 diabetes by improving glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, while also reducing fatty liver disease through the inhibition of hepatic lipogenesis and induction of β-oxidation (Dong2009Activation).

In liver diseases, CAR expression is often reduced, which may contribute to decreased liver metabolic capacity and fibrosis severity (DaujatChavanieu2020Regulation). Genetic variations in NR1I3 can influence drug metabolism, affecting individual responses to medications and potentially leading to severe pathological phenotypes under conditions of elevated endobiotics (Lamba2005Genetic). Additionally, CAR's role in regulating serum triglyceride levels under metabolic stress has implications for conditions like diabetes and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), where its activity affects hepatic fatty acid oxidation (Maglich2009The).

## Interactions
The NR1I3 gene, encoding the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), participates in various protein interactions that regulate its activity and localization. CAR interacts with phosphorylated ERK1/2, which represses its dephosphorylation and sequesters it in the cytoplasm. This interaction is crucial for maintaining CAR in an inactive state when phosphorylated at Thr-38, as demonstrated by the interaction of the phosphorylation-mimicking CAR T38D mutant with phosphorylated ERK1/2 in Huh-7 cells (Osabe2011Active).

CAR also interacts with the transcription factor FOXO1, which acts as a coactivator for CAR. This interaction is modulated by the insulin-PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, which can reduce FOXO1 activity and subsequently decrease CAR-mediated transactivation. CAR can also repress FOXO1-mediated transcription of gluconeogenic genes, highlighting a reciprocal regulatory mechanism (Kodama2004Nuclear).

Additionally, CAR forms heterodimers with RXRα, which is essential for its DNA binding and transcriptional activity. The I281T mutation in CAR affects its ligand-binding domain, potentially altering its interaction with RXRα and reducing transcriptional activation due to insufficient recruitment of coactivators (Prantner2018Functional).
