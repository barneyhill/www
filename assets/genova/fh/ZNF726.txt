# ZNF726

## Overview
ZNF726 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 726, which is part of the zinc finger protein family known for their role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which facilitate their interaction with DNA, RNA, or other proteins, thereby influencing gene expression and cellular processes. ZNF726 has been implicated in various biological functions, including its involvement in cancer biology and aging. The protein encoded by ZNF726 is particularly noted for its potential regulatory roles in colorectal cancer and ovarian aging, where it may influence gene expression through mechanisms such as DNA methylation (Chen2022Transcriptome; Zhang2020DNA‑methylated).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZNF726 has been identified as a significant gene in the context of colorectal cancer (CRC). Studies have shown that ZNF726 is hypermethylated and less expressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, which is associated with poorer overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in CRC patients (Ghorbani2021Aberrantly; Zhang2020DNA‑methylated). The methylation status of ZNF726 has been linked to its potential as a diagnostic marker, with a high area under the curve (AUC) of 0.929 in ROC curve analysis, indicating its diagnostic value (Zhang2020DNA‑methylated). 

ZNF726 expression is considered an independent prognostic risk factor for OS in CRC patients, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for CRC prognosis (Zhang2020DNA‑methylated). The gene's methylation and expression levels have been validated in various tumor tissues and CRC cell lines, confirming its downregulation in CRC and regulation by DNA methylation (Zhang2020DNA‑methylated). 

In addition to its role in CRC, ZNF726 has been implicated in the regulatory processes of ovarian aging, where it is significantly activated in younger age groups, potentially influencing inflammation and age-related changes (Chen2022Transcriptome).
