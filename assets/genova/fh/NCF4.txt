# NCF4

## Overview
The NCF4 gene encodes the protein neutrophil cytosolic factor 4, commonly referred to as p40phox, which is a critical component of the NADPH oxidase complex. This protein plays a pivotal role in the immune system by facilitating the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are essential for the respiratory burst used by phagocytes to eliminate pathogens (Kim2014Activation; Dinauer2019Inflammatory). NCF4 is characterized by its phox homology (PX) domain, which binds phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P), and a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, which mediates protein-protein interactions (Winter2016A). The protein's interactions within the NADPH oxidase complex are crucial for its activation and function, impacting immune responses and inflammation (Dinauer2019Inflammatory). Mutations in the NCF4 gene can lead to impaired ROS production, contributing to conditions such as chronic granulomatous disease and very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (Matute2009A; Wright2019Early).

## Structure
The NCF4 protein, also known as p40phox, is a component of the NADPH oxidase complex, which plays a crucial role in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in immune responses. The protein contains a phox homology (PX) domain, which is essential for binding phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) and directing the NOX2 complex to phagosomal membranes. This domain is critical for oxidase activation, with specific arginines (58 and 105) being essential for PtdIns3P binding (Winter2016A). NCF4 also includes a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions (Winter2016A).

Post-translational modifications of NCF4 include phosphorylation, with threonine 154 being a key site necessary for NOX2 activation (Winter2016A). The protein's structure allows it to interact with other subunits of the NOX2 complex, such as NCF1 (p47phox) and NCF2 (p67phox), facilitating their translocation to the membrane and interaction with the membrane-bound complex flavocytochrome b 558 (Olsson2007A). These interactions are crucial for the proper functioning of the NADPH oxidase complex in immune responses.

## Function
NCF4, also known as p40phox, is a subunit of the NADPH oxidase complex, which plays a crucial role in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in phagocytes. This process is essential for the respiratory burst, a rapid release of ROS used by immune cells to kill invading pathogens (Kim2014Activation; Dinauer2019Inflammatory). The p40phox protein is encoded by the NCF4 gene and is predominantly expressed in bone marrow cells, including neutrophils and monocytes (Kim2014Activation).

In healthy human cells, NCF4 is involved in the regulation of NADPH oxidase activity. It contains a regulatory domain that binds to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P), a lipid found on phagosomal and other intracellular membranes, which is crucial for the activation of the oxidase complex in response to phagocytic stimuli (Dinauer2019Inflammatory). This binding facilitates the translocation of cytosolic components to the membrane, enabling the assembly of the active enzyme complex and subsequent ROS production (Kim2014Activation).

The ROS generated by NADPH oxidase are not only important for microbial killing but also play roles in signaling pathways that regulate immune responses and inflammation (Dinauer2019Inflammatory). Deficiencies or mutations in NCF4 can lead to impaired ROS production, affecting immune function and potentially contributing to conditions such as chronic granulomatous disease (Dinauer2019Inflammatory).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NCF4 gene have been implicated in several diseases, primarily due to their impact on the NADPH oxidase complex, which is crucial for reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. One significant condition associated with NCF4 mutations is chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), an immunodeficiency disorder characterized by recurrent infections and inflammation. This is due to defects in the phagocyte NADPH oxidase complex, leading to impaired microbial killing (Matute2009A). 

NCF4 mutations have also been linked to very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD), where they cause severe neutrophil dysfunction and intestinal inflammation. This condition can be monogenic with high penetrance, unlike classical IBD, which is multifactorial (Wright2019Early). 

In autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), mutations in NCF4 can lead to reduced intracellular ROS production, promoting disease progression. This has been demonstrated in mouse models where NCF4 mutations resulted in increased severity of autoimmune arthritis (Winter2016A). 

Additionally, variations in NCF4 have been associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer, potentially due to their role in modulating the activity of the NADPH complex and affecting ROS production (Ryan2013Germline).

## Interactions
NCF4, also known as neutrophil cytosolic factor 4, is a component of the NADPH oxidase complex and plays a significant role in immune responses through its interactions with various proteins. NCF4 interacts with NCF1 (p47phox) and NCF2 (p67phox) to form the NADPH oxidase complex, which is crucial for the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Li2024NCF4). This complex also includes the small GTPase RAC1 or RAC2, and transmembrane subunits CYBB/gp91phox and CYBA/p22phox (Winter2016A).

NCF4 is known to bind to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) through its PX domain, directing the NOX2 complex to phagosomal membranes, which is essential for regulating intracellular ROS levels (Winter2016A). The interactions between NCF4 and VAV1 are highly conserved, involving hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions that are crucial for maintaining the structure of the NCF2/NCF4/VAV1 complex (Armstrong2015Systemic).

NCF4 also interacts with ASC, a key component in inflammasome activation, and this interaction is necessary for the formation of ASC specks and the activation of inflammasomes such as NLRP3 and AIM2 (Li2024NCF4). These interactions highlight NCF4's role in balancing ROS production and inflammasome activation, which is significant in immune responses and disease contexts like colorectal cancer (Li2024NCF4).
