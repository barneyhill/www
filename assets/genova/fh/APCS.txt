# APCS

## Overview
The APCS gene encodes the serum amyloid P component (SAP), a non-fibrillar glycoprotein that belongs to the pentraxin family of proteins. SAP is primarily synthesized in the liver and circulates in the bloodstream, playing a significant role in the immune system and tissue homeostasis. As a pentraxin, SAP is characterized by its pentameric structure, which is crucial for its function in binding to various ligands, including DNA, chromatin, and amyloid fibrils. This binding capability allows SAP to participate in the clearance of cellular debris and apoptotic cells, thereby preventing autoimmunity and contributing to the regulation of inflammatory responses. Additionally, SAP's interaction with Fcγ receptors on leukocytes enhances phagocytosis, further underscoring its importance in immune modulation (Bickerstaff1999Serum; Bharadwaj2001Serum).

## Structure
Serum amyloid P component (SAP), encoded by the APCS gene, is a member of the pentraxin protein family. It is a naturally circulating serum protein produced in the liver. The primary structure of SAP consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain. Its secondary structure includes beta-sheets, which contribute to its stability (Castaño2009Serum).

The tertiary structure of SAP involves the folding of these beta-sheets into a stable three-dimensional shape. The quaternary structure is characterized by the formation of a highly stable pentameric ring, composed of five noncovalently linked 27-kD protomers, resulting in a total molecular weight of 135 kD. These protomers are associated into a ring-like structure, which is crucial for its function (Castaño2009Serum).

SAP contains two unique binding sites on each protomer: a calcium-dependent ligand-binding site and a receptor-binding site for specific Fcγ receptors. These sites are essential for its role in recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) on apoptotic cell membranes, facilitating FcγR-dependent phagocytosis (Castaño2009Serum). SAP may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can influence its function and stability (Andersson2013Inhibition).

## Function
The APCS gene encodes the serum amyloid P component (SAP), a plasma protein that plays a crucial role in the immune system and tissue homeostasis. SAP is a member of the pentraxin family and is involved in the regulation of chromatin degradation and the prevention of autoimmunity. It binds to DNA and chromatin, solubilizing and stabilizing these structures, which helps maintain tolerance to chromatin epitopes and targets them for catabolism in the liver, thereby reducing their immunogenicity and preventing autoimmunity (Bickerstaff1999Serum).

SAP also interacts with Fcγ receptors on leukocytes, enhancing the phagocytosis of opsonized particles, which is important for the clearance of cellular debris and pathogens (Bharadwaj2001Serum). Additionally, SAP inhibits fibrocyte differentiation and fibrosis, promoting the formation of anti-inflammatory macrophages, which is significant in the context of fibrosing diseases (Cox2015DCSIGN; Pilling2014Persistent).

In humans, SAP is constitutively expressed at stable serum levels and is involved in the clearance of DNA, potentially influencing the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines by facilitating DNA uptake and degradation by macrophages (Wang2011Serum).

## Interactions
The APCS gene encodes the serum amyloid P component (SAP), which is involved in various protein interactions, particularly within the immune system. SAP is known to interact with mannose-binding lectin (MBL), forming MBL-SAP complexes that enhance complement activation, although these complexes do not recruit C1q, a component typically involved in complement system activation (Ma2011Heterocomplexes). This interaction is calcium-dependent, as the presence of EDTA, a calcium chelator, significantly reduces SAP binding to MBL (Ma2011Heterocomplexes).

SAP also binds to basement membranes and is associated with amyloid fibrils in secondary amyloidosis, indicating its role in amyloid formation (FloydSmith1986The). The interaction between SAP and MBL is specific, as no significant binding is observed between MBL and C-reactive protein (CRP), another member of the pentraxin family (Ma2011Heterocomplexes). The MBL-SAP complexes may serve as a primary defense mechanism in circulation, potentially compensating for complement deficiencies (Ma2011Heterocomplexes). These interactions highlight the role of SAP in immune response modulation and its potential involvement in inflammatory conditions.
