# TRAPPC6B

## Overview
TRAPPC6B is a gene that encodes the protein trafficking protein particle complex subunit 6B, which is a component of the TRAPP (Transport Protein Particle) complex. This protein is integral to intracellular trafficking processes, particularly in the regulation of protein transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. As a part of the TRAPP complex, TRAPPC6B is involved in the formation of heterodimers and heterotrimers, contributing to the assembly and function of the complex in various cellular pathways, including the secretory, endocytic, and autophagy pathways (Zappa2019The; Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:). The protein also plays a role in stress response by participating in the formation of stress granules. Mutations in the TRAPPC6B gene have been associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its importance in brain development and function (Aslanger2023Clinical; Fathalla2019“Neurodevelopmental).

## Function
TRAPPC6B is a subunit of the TRAPP (Transport Protein Particle) complex, which plays a crucial role in intracellular trafficking processes. It is involved in the formation of heterodimers with TRAPPC3, similar to the TRAPPC6A1-TRAPPC3 heterodimer, and can further interact with TRAPPC1 to form a heterotrimeric complex. These interactions are essential for the assembly and function of the TRAPP complex, which is involved in various segments of membrane trafficking, including the secretory, endocytic, and autophagy pathways (Zappa2019The; Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:).

In mammals, the TRAPP complex exists in two forms, TRAPPII and TRAPPIII, both of which share a common heptameric core. TRAPPII is implicated in late Golgi trafficking, while TRAPPIII is involved in the early secretory pathway and autophagy (Zappa2019The). TRAPPC6B, as part of these complexes, contributes to the regulation of protein trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, a process vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper protein sorting and secretion (Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:).

TRAPPC6B is also a component of stress granules, which assemble in response to cellular stress, impacting the stress response by inhibiting trafficking along the early secretory pathway and recruiting signaling proteins to these granules (Zappa2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TRAPPC6B gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders. Variants in TRAPPC6B have been linked to non-syndromic autosomal recessive intellectual disability (NS-ARID) in consanguineous families from Iran and Pakistan, where a truncating variant was identified (Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:). In Egyptian families, splice variants in TRAPPC6B were associated with phenotypes such as microcephaly, epilepsy, and brain malformations, including atrophy and thinning of the corpus callosum (Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:). These phenotypes are similar to those seen in individuals with TRAPPC9 variants, suggesting a possible impaired association with TRAPP II (Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:).

The TRAPPC6B gene is also implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders with epilepsy, spasticity, and brain atrophy (NEDESBA) (Aslanger2023Clinical). A specific case involved a 4-year-old male with a novel homozygous variant in TRAPPC6B, presenting with epilepsy, microcephaly, severe neuromotor developmental delay, absent speech, and autism (Aslanger2023Clinical). This variant was classified as pathogenic and associated with cerebral atrophy (Aslanger2023Clinical).

Additionally, TRAPPC6B mutations are linked to a disorder known as NEDMEBA, characterized by intellectual disability, microcephaly, epilepsy, and brain atrophy (Fathalla2019“Neurodevelopmental). The gene's role in vesicle transport is crucial for brain development, and its dysfunction is linked to these clinical features (Fathalla2019“Neurodevelopmental).

## Interactions
TRAPPC6B is a subunit of the TRAPP complex, which is involved in intracellular trafficking processes. It has been structurally characterized as both a homodimer and a heterodimer in complex with TRAPPC3. The TRAPPC6B-TRAPPC3 heterodimer is nearly identical to the TRAPPC6A1-TRAPPC3 heterodimer, although the latter occupies a larger surface area on TRAPPC3. These heterodimers can form a heterotrimeric complex with TRAPPC1, indicating interactions with other TRAPP proteins to form isocomplexes, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation studies in mammalian cells (Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:).

TRAPPC6B has also been identified as a core component of the Golgi-localized TRAPP multi-subunit tethering complex (MTC), playing a role in the trafficking of Shiga toxin 2a (Stx2a) in kidney epithelial cells. The knockdown of TRAPPC6B, along with other targets like RAB5A and YKT6, significantly reduces the cytotoxicity of Stx2a, indicating its involvement in the toxin's trafficking pathway (Kouzel2020RAB5A).

Additionally, TRAPPC6B has a weak but observable interaction with TRAPPC9, suggesting a specific but less extensive interaction compared to other TRAPP subunits like TRAPPC2 (Zong2011The). These interactions highlight TRAPPC6B's role in the broader network of the TRAPP complex.
