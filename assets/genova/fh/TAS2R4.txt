# TAS2R4

## Overview
TAS2R4 is a gene that encodes the protein taste 2 receptor member 4, which is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This receptor is primarily involved in the detection of bitter compounds, playing a crucial role in the sensory perception of taste. The TAS2R4 protein is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure, typical of GPCRs, and is involved in signal transduction processes that help prevent the ingestion of potentially harmful substances (Behrens2020StructureFunction; Yang2021Predicted). Beyond its role in taste, TAS2R4 is expressed in various extraoral tissues, where it participates in diverse physiological processes, including neurobiological functions, immune responses, and thyroid hormone regulation (Yang2021Predicted; Lu2017Extraoral). The receptor's involvement in these processes underscores its significance in both metabolic and immune system regulation, suggesting potential therapeutic targets for related diseases (Yang2021Predicted).

## Structure
The TAS2R4 protein is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain (TMD) structure, which is typical of GPCRs (Behrens2020StructureFunction; Yang2021Predicted). The primary structure of TAS2R4 includes specific amino acid residues that are crucial for its function, such as D92 3.36, which is involved in ligand binding through hydrogen bonds and salt bridges (Yang2021Predicted). The secondary structure is composed of alpha-helices that span the cell membrane, forming the transmembrane domains (Behrens2020StructureFunction).

The tertiary structure of TAS2R4 involves the 3D folding of these transmembrane helices, allowing for interactions with ligands and G proteins. The predicted structure of TAS2R4 complexed with the gustducin G protein reveals specific interactions, such as salt bridges between intracellular loops and the G protein, which are essential for receptor activation (Yang2021Predicted). TAS2R4 lacks the conserved DRY motif found in typical Class A GPCRs, suggesting a unique activation mechanism (Yang2021Predicted).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are important for the proper folding and routing of TAS2R4 to the plasma membrane (Behrens2020StructureFunction). These structural features contribute to the receptor's ability to detect bitter compounds and participate in signal transduction.

## Function
The TAS2R4 gene encodes a bitter taste receptor that is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, primarily known for its role in detecting bitter compounds to prevent the ingestion of potentially toxic substances. Beyond its traditional role in taste perception, TAS2R4 is expressed in various extraoral tissues, including the central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, respiratory system, and thyroid, where it participates in diverse physiological processes (Yang2021Predicted; Lu2017Extraoral).

In the central nervous system, TAS2R4 may be involved in neurobiological processes, including the regulation of neurotransmitter levels and synaptic functions, potentially influencing pathways related to addiction and caffeine metabolism (Zhu2020Bitter). In the respiratory system, TAS2R4 contributes to innate immunity by increasing intracellular calcium levels and ciliary beat frequency, aiding in the clearance of microorganisms (Lu2017Extraoral).

TAS2R4 also plays a role in thyroid function, where it is involved in hormone production and may influence thyroid hormone levels, potentially affecting the risk of papillary thyroid carcinoma (Choi2018Genetic). The receptor's involvement in these processes highlights its significance in both metabolic and immune system regulation, suggesting potential therapeutic targets for related diseases (Yang2021Predicted).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the TAS2R4 gene have been implicated in various health conditions. In breast cancer, TAS2R4 expression is significantly lower in cancerous tissues compared to normal breast tissues. This down-regulation may contribute to cancer cell proliferation and migration, suggesting a potential mechanism for cancer cells to evade apoptosis (Singh2020Chemosensory; Lu2017Extraoral). Activation of TAS2R4 in breast cancer cells has been shown to attenuate proliferation and migration, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Singh2020Chemosensory).

In thyroid health, genetic variations in TAS2R4, particularly the TAS2R3/4 CC haplotype, have been associated with a reduced risk of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) in Korean females. This haplotype is linked to lower concentrations of total triiodothyronine (TT3), which may provide a protective effect against PTC (Choi2018Genetic). These findings suggest that TAS2R4 may play a role in thyroid hormone regulation and cancer susceptibility.

Overall, TAS2R4's involvement in these conditions highlights its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in cancer and thyroid disorders (Harris2024Extragustatory).

## Interactions
TAS2R4, a human bitter taste receptor, interacts with the gustducin G protein, a key player in taste signal transduction. The receptor forms strong salt bridges with the intracellular loops of TAS2R4, which helps orient the Gα5 helix of the Gα subunit to interact with the receptor's cytoplasmic region (Yang2021Predicted). This interaction is crucial for the receptor's activation mechanism, which involves a 'G protein-first' activation process where the G protein binds to the receptor before agonist binding completes the activation (Yang2021Predicted).

The receptor's binding pocket involves the residue D92 3.36, which provides significant binding energy through polar interactions with agonists, influencing the hydrogen bond network and receptor activation (Yang2021Predicted). This interaction is essential for the receptor's function in detecting bitter compounds. The study of TAS2R4's interactions with ligands like Rubusoside and quinine highlights the role of specific residues in ligand binding and activation, with D92 3.36 forming hydrogen bonds and salt bridges that contribute significantly to binding energy and activation signal transmission (Yang2021Predicted).
