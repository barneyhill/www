# TIMP1

## Overview
TIMP1 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases 1) is a gene that encodes the TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 1 protein, a critical regulator of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are enzymes involved in the degradation of the extracellular matrix. The TIMP1 protein is categorized as an inhibitor and plays a vital role in maintaining tissue homeostasis by preventing excessive ECM breakdown (Ries2013Cytokine). Beyond its inhibitory function, TIMP1 exhibits cytokine-like activities, influencing various cellular processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation through interactions with specific cell surface receptors (Ries2013Cytokine). The gene's expression and the protein's activity are implicated in several physiological and pathological processes, including tissue remodeling, cancer progression, and inflammatory responses (Song2016TIMP1; Meissburger2011Tissue). TIMP1's multifunctional nature underscores its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states, making it a subject of interest in clinical research and therapeutic development (StetlerStevenson2008Tissue).

## Structure
TIMP1 (TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 1) is a protein characterized by a complex molecular structure that plays a crucial role in inhibiting matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The primary structure of TIMP1 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain. Its secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, with the N-terminal domain featuring an oligonucleotide and oligosaccharide binding (OB) fold, consisting of a five-stranded closed twisted β-barrel with a Greek key topology, and three α-helices (Brew2010The). The C-terminal domain contains a pair of parallel β strands connected by a loop, followed by a helix and a pair of antiparallel β-strands connected by a β-hairpin (Brew2010The).

The tertiary structure of TIMP1 is stabilized by disulfide bonds between conserved cysteines, which are important for its inhibitory function (Brew2010The). These disulfide bonds contribute to the protein's stability and activity. TIMP1 does not typically form quaternary structures but interacts with MMPs to form tight non-covalent 1:1 complexes (GomisR¨th1997Mechanism). Common post-translational modifications include glycosylation, which affects the protein's stability and activity (Bodden1994Functional).

## Function
TIMP1 (TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 1) is a multifunctional protein that plays a crucial role in regulating matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are enzymes involved in the breakdown of the extracellular matrix (ECM). By inhibiting MMPs, TIMP1 helps maintain ECM integrity and is essential for tissue remodeling and homeostasis (Ries2013Cytokine). Beyond its role as an MMP inhibitor, TIMP1 exhibits cytokine-like activities, influencing cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and angiogenesis through direct interactions with specific cell surface receptors (Ries2013Cytokine).

TIMP1 is involved in cell growth regulation by promoting proliferation in various cell types, including erythroid progenitor cells and fibroblasts, through receptor-mediated activation of signaling pathways such as the Ras-MAPK and PI3-K pathways (Ries2013Cytokine). It also plays a role in cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis through interactions with CD63 and integrin β1, activating survival signals via FAK, PI3-K, and eRK pathways (Ries2013Cytokine).

In addition to its cellular functions, TIMP1 is implicated in organismal processes such as adipogenesis, where it regulates adipocyte differentiation and influences adipose tissue plasticity, particularly in the context of obesity (Meissburger2011Tissue). TIMP1's activities are not limited to MMP inhibition, as it also engages in receptor-mediated signaling pathways that contribute to its diverse biological functions (StetlerStevenson2008Tissue).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TIMP1 gene have significant clinical implications in various diseases, particularly cancers. In colon cancer, TIMP1 is overexpressed and correlates with regional lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, vascular invasion, and advanced AJCC stage. High TIMP1 levels are associated with shorter disease-free survival and overall survival, making it an independent prognostic indicator for colon cancer progression and metastasis (Song2016TIMP1).

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), elevated TIMP1 expression is linked to poor prognosis. This overexpression is associated with promoter hypomethylation and contributes to cell proliferation through the activation of the Akt signaling pathway. Silencing TIMP1 in TNBC cells results in cell cycle arrest, highlighting its role in cancer progression (Cheng2016Higher).

TIMP1 also plays a role in severe sepsis, where the T allele of the 372 T/C polymorphism is associated with higher serum levels of TIMP1 and increased mortality, particularly in men (Lorente2013The). In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), certain TIMP1 gene polymorphisms are linked to disease progression, suggesting a genetic predisposition influenced by TIMP1 variations (Kumar2011Combinatorial).

## Interactions
TIMP1 (TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 1) is known for its interactions with various matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), including MMP-3 and MMP-10. TIMP1 inhibits MMP-3 by inserting into its active-site cleft, with the N-terminal Cys1 residue playing a crucial role by binding to the catalytic zinc of MMP-3 (GomisR¨th1997Mechanism). The interaction involves several hydrophobic contacts, particularly with the Thr2 side chain extending into the S1' specificity pocket of MMP-3 (GomisR¨th1997Mechanism). TIMP1 also inhibits MMP-10, although with a weaker affinity compared to MMP-3, due to differences in the contact interface and solvation energy changes (Batra2012Matrix).

Beyond its role in MMP inhibition, TIMP1 interacts with the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF), specifically through PLZF's ninth zinc finger domain. This interaction reduces PLZF's DNA binding affinity, affecting transcriptional repression and cell proliferation (Rho2007TIMP‐1). TIMP1's interaction with PLZF highlights its multifunctional nature, extending its influence beyond extracellular matrix regulation to include roles in intracellular signaling and cell cycle regulation (Rho2007TIMP‐1).
