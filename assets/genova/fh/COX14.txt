# COX14

## Overview
COX14 is a gene that encodes the cytochrome c oxidase assembly factor COX14, a mitochondrial protein crucial for the assembly and regulation of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), also known as complex IV of the electron transport chain. This protein is categorized as an assembly factor, playing a pivotal role in the integration and stabilization of COX subunits within the MITRAC complex, which is essential for efficient mitochondrial respiration and energy production (Vidoni2017MR1S). COX14 functions as a negative regulator of COX1 translation, ensuring the proper assembly of COX and preventing the formation of defective intermediates (Szklarczyk2012Iterative). Mutations in the COX14 gene have been linked to severe mitochondrial disorders, underscoring its significance in maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular energy homeostasis (Brischigliaro2021Cytochrome; Ghezzi2018Human).

## Function
The human gene COX14 encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), also known as complex IV, which is a vital component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. COX14 is involved in the regulation and assembly of COX intermediates, functioning as part of the MITRAC complex. This complex is essential for the proper integration and stabilization of COX subunits into the mature enzyme complex, which is crucial for efficient cellular respiration and energy production in mitochondria (Vidoni2017MR1S).

In human cells, COX14 acts as a negative regulator of COX1 translation, similar to its yeast ortholog, by interacting directly with COX1. Overexpression of COX14 leads to reduced levels of COX1, COX2, and COX4 proteins, as well as the COX holocomplex, indicating its role in controlling the assembly process to prevent the formation of defective intermediates (Szklarczyk2012Iterative). The protein is localized to the mitochondria, where it is involved in the early stages of COX assembly, ensuring the proper function of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and maintaining cellular energy homeostasis (Szklarczyk2012Iterative).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the COX14 gene are associated with several severe mitochondrial disorders. A homozygous mutation in COX14 was identified in three siblings who exhibited severe congenital lactic acidosis and dysmorphic features, linked to a defect in cytochrome c oxidase (COX) assembly (Ghezzi2018Human). Another study identified a pathogenic COX14 allele in an infant with fatal COX deficiency, presenting with severe metabolic acidosis, respiratory distress, neurological abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, hepatomegaly, and renal hypoplasia. This mutation, c.88G>A, results in the substitution of methionine with isoleucine at position 191 (p.Met191Ile) (Brischigliaro2021Cytochrome).

In mouse models, the COX14 M19I mutation, which mirrors the human condition, leads to defective mitochondrial COX1 translation, reduced complex IV activity, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. This results in liver inflammation, heart hypertrophy, and retinal degeneration, highlighting the mutation's impact on mitochondrial function and its role in triggering inflammation (Aich2024Defective). The COX14 gene has also been implicated in an unusual intracranial mesenchymal tumor, characterized by a novel genetic rearrangement involving COX14 and PTEN, although its role in cancer pathogenesis remains unclear (d’Amati2023Intracranial).

## Interactions
COX14, also known as C12ORF62, is involved in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) in mitochondria. It interacts with several proteins to regulate the translation and assembly of the COX1 subunit. COX14 forms part of the early MITRAC complex, which includes MITRAC12 (COA3), and associates with the ribosome-COX1 nascent chain complex to assist in the membrane insertion and stabilization of the nascent COX1 polypeptide (Aich2024Defective).

COX14 interacts with Mss51p, a translational activator, and Cox1p, a subunit of cytochrome c oxidase, forming a complex that regulates COX1 mRNA translation. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of Cox1p expression and is part of a negative feedback mechanism that prevents excessive Cox1p synthesis (Mick2010Coa3; Barrientos2004Mss51p). COX14 and Mss51p are located on the matrix side of the inner mitochondrial membrane, where they act as sensors of unassembled Cox1p (Barrientos2004Mss51p).

COX14 also interacts with Coa3, Shy1, and Coa1, forming part of a larger complex involved in the assembly of cytochrome oxidase. These interactions are essential for the recruitment and inactivation of Mss51, which is necessary for the proper regulation of COX1 translation (Mick2010Coa3).
