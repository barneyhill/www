# HSPE1

## Overview
The HSPE1 gene encodes the mitochondrial co-chaperonin protein known as heat shock protein family E (Hsp10) member 1. This protein is a critical component of the HSP60/HSP10 chaperonin complex, which plays a vital role in the proper folding of proteins within the mitochondrial matrix. Hsp10 functions as a co-chaperonin, working in conjunction with Hsp60 to facilitate the folding and stabilization of newly imported mitochondrial proteins, thereby maintaining protein homeostasis. The HSPE1 gene is located in close proximity to the HSPD1 gene, which encodes Hsp60, and both genes are regulated by a bidirectional promoter, ensuring their coordinated expression (Hansen2003Genomic). Mutations in HSPE1 can lead to significant clinical implications, including neurological and developmental disorders, due to the disruption of mitochondrial protein folding and function (Bie2016Effects).

## Structure
The HSPE1 gene encodes the mitochondrial co-chaperonin HSP10, which is a crucial component of the HSP60/HSP10 chaperonin complex involved in protein folding within the mitochondrial matrix. The primary structure of HSP10 consists of a sequence of amino acids, including a leucine at position 73, which is part of the hydrophobic core of the protein (Bie2016Effects). The secondary structure of HSP10 typically includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stability and function. 

The tertiary structure of HSP10 is characterized by its overall three-dimensional shape, which is essential for its interaction with other proteins and its function as a chaperone. The quaternary structure involves the assembly of HSP10 into a heptameric ring, which is a common feature of chaperonins, allowing it to form a complex with HSP60 (Bie2016Effects). 

Post-translational modifications of HSP10 may include phosphorylation and acetylation, which can influence its activity and stability. The HSPE1 gene is located in a head-to-head arrangement with the HSPD1 gene, which encodes HSP60, and both are transcribed under a bidirectional promoter, ensuring a coordinated expression of these chaperonins (Hansen2003Genomic).

## Function
The HSPE1 gene encodes the mitochondrial co-chaperonin HSP10, which plays a crucial role in protein folding within the mitochondria. HSP10 functions as part of the HSP60/HSP10 chaperonin complex, which is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular energy production. The HSP60 subunits form a double-barrel structure that binds unfolded proteins, while the HSP10 subunits act as a 'lid' to enclose these proteins within the complex. This process is ATP-dependent, with ATP binding and hydrolysis inducing conformational changes that facilitate protein folding (Bie2016Effects).

The HSP60/HSP10 complex is a key component of the mitochondrial protein quality control system, ensuring proper protein folding and preventing the accumulation of misfolded proteins. This system is vital for maintaining the functional proteome and is involved in various cellular processes, including the folding of proteins like superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), which is crucial for mitochondrial function (Bie2016Effects). The proper function of the HSPE1 gene is therefore critical for maintaining the balance and efficiency of protein folding in mitochondria, which is vital for cellular health and function (Bie2016Effects).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HSPE1 gene, which encodes the mitochondrial co-chaperonin HSP10, have been associated with neurological and developmental disorders. A specific mutation, HSP10-p.Leu73Phe, has been identified in a patient exhibiting symptoms such as infantile spasms, developmental delay, and hypotonia. This mutation leads to decreased thermal stability and increased susceptibility to proteolytic degradation of the HSP10 protein, resulting in a reduced HSP10 to HSP60 protein ratio. This imbalance impairs the folding of proteins dependent on the HSP60/HSP10 complex, such as mitochondrial superoxide dismutase SOD2, which is crucial for managing oxidative stress in cells (Bie2016Effects).

The mutation was found to be de novo, as it was not present in the patient's parents, and it has not been previously reported in genetic databases or literature. In silico analysis predicted the mutation to be possibly damaging, and structural analysis suggested that it affects the protein's stability without directly impacting its interaction with HSP60 (Bie2016Effects). The study highlights the potential link between HSPE1 mutations and neurological conditions, although no specific monogenic diseases caused by SOD2 mutations have been described (Bie2016Effects).

## Interactions
HSPE1, also known as Hsp10, is a mitochondrial co-chaperonin that primarily interacts with Hsp60 to form a chaperonin complex essential for the proper folding of mitochondrial proteins. This complex plays a crucial role in maintaining protein homeostasis within the mitochondrial matrix by assisting in the folding and stabilization of newly imported proteins (Bie2016Effects).

The HSPE1 protein, through its interaction with Hsp60, is involved in the refolding of malate dehydrogenase (MDH), although the mutant form of HSPE1 requires higher concentrations to achieve saturation compared to the wild type (Bie2016Effects). The mutation in HSPE1, specifically the Leu73Phe variant, affects its thermal stability and makes it more susceptible to proteolytic degradation, which can impact its interactions and functionality within the chaperonin complex (Bie2016Effects).

In addition to its role in protein folding, HSPE1 has been implicated in forming a multiprotein complex with mitochondrial procaspase-3, which is consistent with its chaperone function. This interaction is part of its involvement in the regulation of apoptosis, where it can influence the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (Kennedy2014Regulation).
