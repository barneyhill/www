# HAS2

## Overview
Hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2) is a gene that encodes the enzyme hyaluronan synthase 2, a transmembrane glycosyltransferase responsible for the synthesis of hyaluronan, a vital component of the extracellular matrix. The HAS2 enzyme is integral to the plasma membrane, where it facilitates the polymerization and extrusion of hyaluronan into the extracellular space, playing a crucial role in maintaining tissue hydration, integrity, and facilitating cellular processes such as proliferation and migration (Itano2002Mammalian; Michael2011The). The gene is located on chromosome 8 at q24.12 and is subject to regulation by various cytokines, which modulate its expression and, consequently, hyaluronan production (Siiskonen2015Hyaluronan; Michael2011The). HAS2 is implicated in several physiological and pathological processes, including embryonic development, tissue homeostasis, and cancer progression, where its altered expression is associated with tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis (Ducale2005Regulation; Riecks2022The).

## Structure
The human hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2) is an integral membrane protein involved in the synthesis of hyaluronan, a crucial component of the extracellular matrix. HAS2 is characterized by multiple transmembrane domains, with reports indicating the presence of four to seven such domains (Siiskonen2015Hyaluronan; Itano2002Mammalian). The protein's structure includes a large cytoplasmic loop that contains the catalytic sites necessary for its glycosyltransferase activity, as well as UDP-binding motifs (Itano2002Mammalian). 

HAS2 shares homology with Family 2 glycosyltransferases, particularly in its active sites, which are crucial for its enzymatic function (Itano2002Mammalian). The hydrophobic domains of HAS2 contain essential cysteine residues, and modifications to these residues can alter the enzyme's activity (Adamia2005Hyaluronan). Phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C are predicted within the intracellular loop, suggesting that HAS2 activity may be regulated by phosphorylation (Adamia2005Hyaluronan).

HAS2 is known to produce very large hyaluronan molecules, which are synthesized on the inner face of the plasma membrane and then translocated to the extracellular space (Itano2002Mammalian). The gene encoding HAS2 is located on chromosome 8 at q24.12 (Siiskonen2015Hyaluronan). While specific details on the tertiary and quaternary structures are not provided, the protein's membrane-bound configuration is essential for its function. There are also known splice variants of HAS2, which can influence its function and localization (Michael2011The).

## Function
HAS2 (hyaluronan synthase 2) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the synthesis of hyaluronan (HA), a major component of the extracellular matrix. In healthy human cells, HAS2 is active at the plasma membrane, where it facilitates the polymerization and extrusion of HA into the extracellular space (Itano2002Mammalian). This process is essential for maintaining tissue hydration and integrity, as well as for cell proliferation and migration (Michael2011The).

HAS2 is particularly noted for producing very large HA molecules, with an average molecular mass greater than 2 x 10^6 Da, which can reach up to 4 x 10^6 Da over time (Itano1999Three). The size of HA synthesized by HAS2 influences its biological functions, such as cell adhesion, migration, and differentiation, which are crucial for processes like wound healing and tissue regeneration (Itano1999Three).

The expression of HAS2 is regulated by various factors, including cytokines like IL-1β and TGF-β1, which can modulate its transcription and, consequently, HA production (Michael2011The). This regulation is important for the enzyme's role in physiological processes, such as embryonic development and the maintenance of tissue homeostasis (Ducale2005Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the HAS2 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer. In ovarian cancer, high HAS2 expression is associated with poorer overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), indicating its role in tumor aggressiveness and chemotherapy resistance (Riecks2022The). Knockdown of HAS2 in ovarian cancer cell lines reduces cell viability and spheroid formation, suggesting its importance in tumor growth and cell cohesion (Riecks2022The).

In breast cancer, HAS2 is linked to increased cell motility, invasion, and poor prognosis, particularly in aggressive subtypes like basal-like and triple-negative tumors (Passi2019Dissecting). Its expression is associated with lymph node positivity and poor differentiation, contributing to tumor progression and metastasis (Passi2019Dissecting).

Beyond cancer, HAS2 mutations and expression changes are implicated in developmental disorders. In mice, HAS2 deficiency leads to severe cardiac defects and embryonic lethality, highlighting its critical role in cardiac morphogenesis (Camenisch2000Disruption). A mutation in HAS2 has been linked to congenital heart defects in humans, further underscoring its importance in normal development (TriggsRaine2015Biology).

## Interactions
Hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2) is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence its function and regulation. HAS2 interacts with its natural antisense RNA, HAS2-AS1, which can stabilize or augment HAS2 mRNA expression through RNA/mRNA heteroduplex formation. This interaction is thermodynamically feasible and has been demonstrated in vitro, suggesting a role in the regulation of HAS2 expression (Michael2011The).

HAS2 is also subject to post-translational modifications that affect its activity. It undergoes phosphorylation by adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) at threonine 110, which inhibits its enzymatic activity. O-GlcNAcylation at serine 221 enhances the stability of HAS2 on the plasma membrane, promoting hyaluronan synthesis by preventing its degradation by the 26S proteasome (Vigetti2014Hyaluronan:).

In the context of cancer, HAS2 interacts with tissue metalloproteinase inhibitor 1 (TIMP-1). HAS2 suppresses TIMP-1 expression, which is associated with increased cell invasion and motility. Knockdown of HAS2 leads to increased TIMP-1 expression, which correlates with decreased cell invasion, suggesting that TIMP-1 may inhibit cell motility through its effects on focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation (Bernert2011Hyaluronan).
