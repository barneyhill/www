# CAP1

## Overview
CAP1, or cyclase-associated protein 1, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, a critical component of cellular structure and dynamics. The protein, also referred to as cyclase-associated actin cytoskeleton regulatory protein 1, plays a pivotal role in actin filament depolymerization and reorganization, which are essential processes for maintaining cell shape, motility, and division. CAP1 is categorized as a regulatory protein that interacts with actin monomers and actin-binding proteins, such as cofilin, to enhance actin filament turnover. It is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, particularly in dynamic actin structures, and is involved in various cellular processes, including cell motility, endocytosis, and apoptosis. Alterations in CAP1 expression have been linked to several human diseases, notably cancers, where it is often overexpressed and associated with increased tumor metastasis and poor prognosis (Bertling2004Cyclaseassociated; Rust2020CAPt’n).

## Structure
The human cyclase-associated protein 1 (CAP1) is a multifunctional protein involved in actin cytoskeleton regulation. CAP1 consists of several distinct domains, including an oligomerization domain (OD), a helical folded domain (HFD), two proline-rich motifs (P1, P2), a Wiscott-Aldrich-Syndrome protein (WASP) homology 2 (WH2) domain, and a CAP and RP2 (CARP) domain (Rust2020CAPt’n). The OD, located at the N-terminal, is predicted to form a coiled-coil structure, facilitating oligomerization (Rust2020CAPt’n). The HFD, spanning residues ~40-220, forms an α-helix bundle and interacts with G-actin complexes, promoting F-actin depolymerization (Rust2020CAPt’n).

The C-terminal region of CAP1, between residues ~320 and 474, forms a β-sheet structure composed of six coils of right-handed parallel β-strands, known as the CARP domain. This domain is involved in homodimer formation and binds ADP-G-actin with high affinity (Rust2020CAPt’n). CAP1 can form oligomeric structures such as tetramers, which are more effective in promoting actin severing than monomers or dimers (Purde2019Oligomerization). The oligomerization of CAP1 is crucial for its function in actin dynamics, enhancing cofilin-mediated actin severing and depolymerization (Purde2019Oligomerization).

## Function
Cyclase-associated protein 1 (CAP1) plays a crucial role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for maintaining cell shape, motility, and division. CAP1 is involved in promoting actin filament depolymerization and reorganization, facilitating rapid actin dynamics necessary for various cellular processes (Bertling2004Cyclaseassociated). It interacts with actin monomers and actin-binding proteins such as cofilin, enhancing cofilin-induced actin filament turnover (Bertling2004Cyclaseassociated). CAP1 is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, particularly in dynamic actin structures like the cortical actin cytoskeleton and membrane ruffles, but not in stress fibers (Bertling2004Cyclaseassociated).

In healthy human cells, CAP1 is essential for cell motility and endocytosis. Its depletion leads to impaired cell migration and reduced efficiency in receptor-mediated endocytosis (Bertling2004Cyclaseassociated). CAP1 also plays a role in apoptosis, where it translocates to mitochondria as a pre-apoptotic event, enhancing cofilin-induced apoptosis (Kakurina2018Adenylyl; Wang2008Mitochondrial). Overall, CAP1 is vital for maintaining normal actin dynamics, contributing to cellular processes that impact cell morphology and tissue development.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CAP1 gene, also known as cyclase-associated protein 1, have been implicated in various human diseases, particularly cancers. CAP1 is overexpressed in several cancer types, including pancreatic, breast, liver, lung, and epithelial ovarian cancers. Its overexpression is associated with increased tumor metastasis and poor prognosis, particularly in pancreatic and hepatocellular carcinomas (Yamazaki2009Adenylate; Rust2020CAPt’n). In pancreatic cancer, CAP1 contributes to cancer cell motility, a key factor in the disease's aggressiveness and metastatic potential (Yamazaki2009Adenylate).

In breast cancer, CAP1 plays a role in cell motility and invasiveness, with its function being crucial for actin filament turnover and cell movement. Altered ERK activities are partially responsible for CAP1's context-dependent roles in breast cancer cell proliferation and invasiveness (Hasan2019The). CAP1 also acts as a receptor for Resistin, linking it to chronic inflammation and diseases such as obesity, atherosclerosis, and coronary artery disease. Increased CAP1 expression correlates with higher tumor grades and chemotherapy resistance in colorectal and pancreatic cancer patients (Rust2020CAPt’n).

Mutations in CAP1, specifically in the CAP1/Prss8 form known as prostasin, have been linked to inflammatory bowel diseases. These mutations can lead to decreased epithelial sodium channel activity, impaired barrier function, and increased susceptibility to colitis (Keppner2016Altered).

## Interactions
CAP1 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in actin dynamics and cellular processes. It enhances the effect of cofilin on actin filament turnover by facilitating the addition of ATP-actin monomers to the barbed end of actin filaments and increasing the rate of subunit release at the pointed end. CAP1's C-terminal domain is primarily responsible for these activities, while the N-terminal domain relieves the inhibitory effect of cofilin on nucleotide exchange (Moriyama2002Human). CAP1 does not sever actin filaments directly but may enhance cofilin's severing activity indirectly (Moriyama2002Human).

CAP1 also interacts with Rap1b, a GTPase, as a prenyl-binding partner. This interaction is direct and occurs in a nucleotide-independent manner, suggesting CAP1's role in stabilizing Rap1 at the plasma membrane or acting as a chaperone for its delivery (Zhang2018Cyclaseassociated). CAP1's interaction with Rap1b does not involve the G-domain or effector binding domains of Rap1b, indicating that CAP1 is not a typical Rap1 effector (Zhang2018Cyclaseassociated).

In apoptosis, CAP1 interacts with cofilin, facilitating its translocation to mitochondria and playing a role in cofilin-induced apoptosis (Wang2008Mitochondrial).
