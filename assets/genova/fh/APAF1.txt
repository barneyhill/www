# APAF1

## Overview
APAF1 (apoptotic peptidase activating factor 1) is a gene that encodes a crucial cytoplasmic protein involved in the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. The APAF1 protein is a key component in the formation of the apoptosome, a heptameric complex that activates caspase-9, thereby initiating a cascade of events leading to programmed cell death. Structurally, APAF1 is characterized by several domains, including a caspase recruitment domain (CARD), a nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD), and WD40 repeats, which facilitate its interactions with cytochrome c and procaspase-9 (Reubold2011Crystal; Zhou1999Solution). Beyond its apoptotic functions, APAF1 is also implicated in non-apoptotic processes such as DNA damage-induced cell-cycle arrest, highlighting its role in cellular homeostasis and tumor suppression (Zermati2007Nonapoptotic). Dysregulation of APAF1 is associated with various cancers and neurodegenerative diseases, underscoring its clinical significance (Anichini2006APAF1; Shakeri2021Contribution).

## Structure
APAF1 is a key protein in the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, characterized by its complex molecular structure. The protein is composed of several distinct domains, including an N-terminal caspase recruitment domain (CARD), a central nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD), and C-terminal WD40 repeats (Bao2005Structure; Reubold2011Crystal). The CARD domain consists of six tightly packed amphipathic α-helices, with a notable kink in the N-terminal helix, which is crucial for its interaction with caspase-9 (Zhou1999Solution).

The NOD is subdivided into the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD), helical domains (HD1 and HD2), and a winged-helix domain (WHD) (Reubold2011Crystal). The WD40 repeats form two beta-propellers, a seven-blade and an eight-blade, which are involved in binding cytochrome c and maintaining the autoinhibited conformation of APAF1 (Reubold2011Crystal; Zhou2015Atomic).

In its quaternary structure, APAF1 forms the apoptosome, a heptameric complex that activates caspase-9. This assembly is facilitated by conformational changes upon cytochrome c binding and nucleotide exchange from ADP to ATP (Zhou2015Atomic; Yuan2013Changes). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications and exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, which can influence its function and regulation (Bao2005Structure).

## Function
APAF1 (apoptotic peptidase activating factor 1) is a key component in the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, primarily active in the cytoplasm. It plays a crucial role in the formation of the apoptosome, a complex that initiates the caspase activation cascade leading to cell death. Upon receiving an apoptotic signal, cytochrome c is released from the mitochondria and binds to APAF1, causing a conformational change facilitated by dATP or ATP hydrolysis. This change allows APAF1 to oligomerize into a heptameric apoptosome complex, which recruits and activates procaspase-9. Activated caspase-9 then triggers the activation of effector caspases, such as caspase-3 and caspase-7, culminating in apoptosis (Bratton2010Regulation; Cecconi1999Apaf1).

In addition to its apoptotic role, APAF1 is involved in non-apoptotic processes, such as DNA damage-induced cell-cycle arrest. It participates in the DNA damage checkpoint by modulating the cell cycle independently of its interaction with caspase-9. APAF1's nuclear translocation in response to DNA damage is associated with the activation of checkpoint kinase Chk1, indicating its involvement in the ATR/Chk1 pathway and its role as a tumor suppressor (Zermati2007Nonapoptotic).

## Clinical Significance
APAF1 (apoptotic peptidase activating factor 1) plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of various cancers and neurodegenerative diseases due to its involvement in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. In cancers, APAF1 is often downregulated or inactivated, contributing to resistance to apoptosis and chemotherapeutic agents. This downregulation is frequently due to hypermethylation of the APAF1 gene, as observed in breast, ovarian, cervical, prostate, testicular, blood, brain, head and neck, melanoma, colorectal, lung, esophageal, and pancreatic cancers (Shakeri2021Contribution). In melanoma, APAF1 inactivation occurs through loss of one allele and promoter methylation, contributing to chemoresistance (Anichini2006APAF1). In colorectal carcinoma, allelic imbalance at the APAF1 locus is associated with tumor progression and metastasis (Umetani2004Allelic).

In neurodegenerative diseases, APAF1 is implicated in enhanced cellular death. In Alzheimer's disease, its levels do not significantly differ between affected and healthy subjects, but it is involved in the apoptotic process (Shakeri2021Contribution). In Parkinson's disease, APAF1 regulation influences neuronal survival, making it a potential therapeutic target (Shakeri2021Contribution). In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, APAF1 is involved in apoptosis induced by SOD1 mutations (Shakeri2021Contribution). APAF1's role in these diseases highlights its importance in both cancer and neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis.

## Interactions
APAF1 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. One of its primary interactions is with cytochrome c, which is released from mitochondria upon receiving pro-death signals. This interaction triggers nucleotide exchange and the assembly of the apoptosome, a heptameric complex that activates procaspase-9 through CARD-CARD interactions (Yuan2013Changes). The binding of cytochrome c to APAF1 involves docking between β-propellers, with strong binding facilitated by shape and charge complementarity (Yuan2013Changes).

APAF1 also interacts with procaspase-9, forming a complex essential for its activation. This interaction is mediated by the caspase recruitment domain (CARD) of APAF1, which binds to the CARD of procaspase-9 through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. The interaction surface is centered around helices 2 and 3 of the APAF1 CARD (Zhou1999Solution). Mutagenesis studies have identified key residues involved in this interaction, highlighting the importance of charged surfaces in mutual recognition (Qin1999Structural).

The formation of the apoptosome, facilitated by APAF1, is crucial for the activation of caspase-9, which in turn activates downstream effector caspases, leading to apoptosis (Rodriguez1999Caspase9). APAF1's interactions are regulated by intracellular conditions, such as potassium concentrations, which influence its binding affinity with cytochrome c (Cain2002The).
