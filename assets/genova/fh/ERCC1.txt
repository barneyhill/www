# ERCC1

## Overview
ERCC1 (Excision Repair Cross-Complementation Group 1) is a gene that encodes a protein known as ERCC excision repair 1, endonuclease non-catalytic subunit. This protein is a critical component of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, which is responsible for repairing bulky DNA lesions that can distort the DNA helix, such as those caused by ultraviolet (UV) light and chemical carcinogens. The ERCC1 protein functions as a non-catalytic subunit that forms a heterodimer with the XPF protein, together acting as an endonuclease to facilitate the excision of damaged DNA. This complex is essential for maintaining genomic stability by ensuring the proper repair of DNA and processing of recombination intermediates. The ERCC1-XPF complex is also involved in other DNA repair processes, including interstrand cross-link repair and homologous recombination. Mutations or polymorphisms in the ERCC1 gene can lead to increased susceptibility to various diseases, including cancer and ischemic stroke, due to impaired DNA repair mechanisms (Deng2023ERCC1; Lu2013ERCC1; Sargent1997Recombinationdependent).

## Structure
The ERCC1 protein is a non-catalytic subunit that forms a heterodimer with XPF, essential for its function in DNA repair processes. The primary structure of ERCC1 consists of 297 amino acids, resulting in a protein with a molecular weight of approximately 31 kDa (Koutsoukos2020Clinical). The secondary structure includes a central ERCC4-like domain, which is structurally similar to nuclease domains in archaeal species but lacks catalytic residues, and a helix-hairpin-helix (HhH)2 domain, which is a putative DNA-binding domain (Faridounnia2018Function).

The tertiary structure of ERCC1 is characterized by a tandem HhH2 motif, which binds nonspecifically to the phosphate backbone of DNA and is crucial for interaction with the minor groove of duplex DNA (Faridounnia2018Function). The quaternary structure involves the formation of a heterodimer with XPF, facilitated by the HhH2 motifs present in both proteins, which is necessary for structural stabilization and functional conformation (Manguinhas2024Unveiling).

The ERCC1 protein also contains a highly conserved pocket surrounding Phe293, which is critical for the dimerization with XPF. The deletion of Phe293 disrupts this interaction, highlighting its importance in the protein's structural integrity (Manguinhas2024Unveiling).

## Function
The ERCC1 gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, which is responsible for repairing bulky DNA damage that distorts the DNA helix, such as DNA adducts induced by chemical carcinogens and UV light (Lu2013ERCC1; Dabholkar1992ERCC1). The ERCC1 protein forms a heterodimer with the XPF protein, functioning as an endonuclease that makes a 5' incision around DNA lesions, facilitating their removal and maintaining genomic integrity (Yu1997A; Sargent1997Recombinationdependent).

In healthy human cells, ERCC1 is active in the cell nucleus, where it participates in DNA repair and recombination processes. It plays a role in cleaving the 5' side of damaged DNA during NER and is involved in processing heteroduplex intermediates during homologous recombination (Sargent1997Recombinationdependent). The protein's activity is essential for preventing genome instability and maintaining gene stability by ensuring proper processing of recombination intermediates (Sargent1997Recombinationdependent). Deficiencies in ERCC1 can lead to increased gene rearrangements and deletions, highlighting its role in regulating recombination events and maintaining genomic stability (Sargent1997Recombinationdependent).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ERCC1 gene are associated with various diseases and conditions due to its critical role in DNA repair. In the context of ischemic stroke, polymorphisms in the ERCC1 gene, particularly the rs3212986 polymorphism, have been linked to increased susceptibility. The A allele of this polymorphism is associated with a higher risk of ischemic stroke, potentially due to its impact on ERCC1 mRNA and protein expression, which may contribute to endothelial cell dysfunction and vascular aging (Deng2023ERCC1).

In cancer, ERCC1 polymorphisms have been studied for their role in modifying the risk of malignant mesothelioma, especially in individuals exposed to asbestos. The ERCC1 N118N polymorphism has been associated with an increased risk of developing this cancer (Betti2011XRCC1). Additionally, ERCC1 expression levels can influence the effectiveness of chemotherapy, particularly with platinum-based drugs, as alterations in ERCC1 can affect the cell's ability to repair drug-induced DNA damage (Formica2017Biological; Koutsoukos2020Clinical).

Defects in the ERCC1-XPF complex, which ERCC1 forms with XPF, can lead to severe developmental disorders such as cerebro-oculo-facio-skeletal syndrome, characterized by rapid neurological decline and growth failure (Gregg2011Physiological).

## Interactions
ERCC1, as part of the ERCC1-XPF complex, is involved in several critical protein interactions essential for DNA repair processes. The ERCC1-XPF complex interacts with SLX4, which serves as a scaffold for assembling repair proteins, including MUS81-EME1, enhancing the nuclease activity of ERCC1-XPF and shifting its DNA binding affinity towards DNA flaps with 3' overhangs (Faridounnia2018Function). ERCC1 also interacts with FANCG, crucial for recruiting the complex to interstrand cross-links (ICLs), and this interaction overlaps with the XPA binding site on ERCC1 (Faridounnia2018Function).

ERCC1 has a notable interaction with the mismatch repair protein MSH2, particularly in response to cisplatin-induced DNA damage, suggesting a role in mismatch repair. This interaction is independent of XPF and involves the carboxyl-terminal domain of ERCC1 between amino acids 184 and 260 (Lan2004Functional). Immunoprecipitation studies have shown that antibodies against ERCC1 can co-precipitate MSH2 and XPF proteins, indicating a physical interaction (Lan2004Functional).

ERCC1 also interacts with XPA, which is essential for nucleotide excision repair (NER). The interaction involves specific domains on both proteins, with XPA binding to ERCC1 to facilitate the recruitment of the ERCC1-XPF complex to damaged DNA sites (Faridounnia2018Function; Li1995Mutations).
