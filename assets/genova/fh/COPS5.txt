# COPS5

## Overview
COPS5, also known as COP9 signalosome subunit 5, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the COP9 signalosome (CSN) complex, a multi-protein assembly involved in various cellular processes such as protein degradation, cell cycle regulation, and signal transduction. The protein encoded by COPS5 is characterized by its role as a regulatory subunit within the CSN complex, contributing to the de-neddylation of cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases, which is essential for the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and protein homeostasis (Wei2003The). COPS5 is also known for its interactions with key regulatory proteins, including c-Jun and p53, influencing their stability and activity, thereby impacting apoptosis and cell proliferation (Li2017Roles). The protein's involvement in the nuclear export and degradation of the cell cycle inhibitor p27 further underscores its role in cell cycle progression (Wei2003The). Due to its significant functions in cellular regulation and its implications in cancer progression and drug resistance, COPS5 is a subject of interest in therapeutic research (Zhang2022COPS5; Lu2016COPS5).

## Structure
COPS5, also known as COP9 signalosome subunit 5, is a protein encoded by the COPS5 gene and is a crucial component of the COP9 signalosome complex. The protein has a molecular mass of 38 kDa and contains several important domains that contribute to its function. These include a c-Jun binding domain (JBD), which provides the catalytic center for the CSN isopeptidase activity, and an Mpr1-Pad1-N-terminal (MPN) domain responsible for regulating cullin deneddylation (Huang2019COP9). The MPN domain is essential for the protein's role in the ubiquitin conjugation pathway, which is crucial for protein ubiquitination during spermatogenesis (Huang2019COP9).

COPS5 also features a nuclear export signal (NES) domain and a p27 binding domain (PBD) at the C-terminal end, which are involved in the nuclear export of p27 and interactions with various proteins, modulating their activities and stability (Huang2019COP9). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are likely to regulate the activity of COPS5, as indicated by the presence of canonical phosphorylation sites (Henke1999ComparisonofhumanCOP9signalosomeand26Sproteasome'lid'). The protein is highly conserved among multicellular eukaryotes, highlighting its essential role in cellular processes (Huang2019COP9).

## Function
COPS5, also known as COP9 signalosome subunit 5, is a critical component of the COP9 signalosome (CSN) complex, which is involved in various cellular processes, including protein degradation, cell cycle regulation, and signal transduction. COPS5 plays a significant role in the de-neddylation of cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases, a process essential for regulating ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated protein degradation (Wei2003The). This activity is crucial for maintaining protein stability and cellular homeostasis.

COPS5 is involved in the phosphorylation and stabilization of key proteins such as c-Jun and p53, influencing their degradation and contributing to the regulation of apoptosis and cell proliferation (Wei2003The; Li2017Roles). It also interacts with nuclear receptors and coactivators, affecting nuclear hormone-mediated gene expression (Wei2003The).

In the context of cell cycle control, COPS5 regulates the cell cycle inhibitor p27 by promoting its nuclear export and subsequent proteolysis, facilitating cell cycle progression (Wei2003The). COPS5 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, impacting various signaling pathways and cellular processes, including DNA damage response and tumorigenesis (Huang2019COP9).

## Clinical Significance
COPS5, also known as COP9 signalosome subunit 5, plays a significant role in cancer progression and drug resistance. Overexpression of COPS5 is linked to poor prognosis in various cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung, and colon cancers. In epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), COPS5 is associated with platinum resistance, where its overexpression correlates with shorter progression-free survival and overall survival. Knockdown of COPS5 in EOC cells reduces cell proliferation and increases sensitivity to platinum-based therapies, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2022COPS5).

In breast cancer, particularly ERα-positive types, COPS5 overexpression is implicated in tamoxifen resistance. It promotes the degradation of NCoR, a corepressor necessary for tamoxifen's action, thus converting tamoxifen into an ERα agonist and leading to drug resistance. Targeting COPS5 can restore tamoxifen sensitivity, highlighting its role in endocrine resistance (Lu2016COPS5).

COPS5 is also involved in immune evasion by stabilizing PD-L1, which helps tumor cells evade immune detection. Its inhibition can enhance the efficacy of immunotherapies, making it a potential target for improving cancer treatment outcomes (Liu2018Jab1COPS5).

## Interactions
COPS5, also known as Jab1, is a subunit of the COP9 signalosome complex and interacts with a variety of proteins, playing a significant role in multiple cellular processes. It interacts with tumor-related genes such as p27, p57, MDM2, p53, PD-L1, NcoR, and Bcl2, influencing their activities and stability (Huang2019COP9). COPS5 is involved in the degradation of misfolded cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) by interacting with its core-glycosylated form (Huang2019COP9). In colorectal cancer cells, COPS5 interacts with LASP1, enhancing cell proliferation, migration, and metastasis by modulating the PI3K/Akt pathway and downregulating 14-3-3σ expression (Zhou2017COPS5).

COPS5 also interacts with the progesterone receptor (PR) and the steroid receptor coactivator SRC-1, enhancing hormone-dependent transcription (Chauchereau2000JAB1). It binds to the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 Kip1, facilitating its degradation via the 26S proteasome (Tomoda1999Degradation). Additionally, COPS5 interacts with p53, binding to its N-terminal region, which may target p53 for degradation through the ubiquitin system (BechOtschir2001COP9). These interactions highlight COPS5's role in regulating protein stability and transcriptional activity.
