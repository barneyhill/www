# NFATC3

## Overview
NFATC3, or nuclear factor of activated T cells 3, is a gene that encodes a transcription factor belonging to the NFAT family, which is integral to the regulation of gene expression in response to calcium signaling. The NFATC3 protein is characterized by its Rel homology domain (RHD), which facilitates DNA binding and dimerization, and is subject to regulation through post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation. As a transcription factor, NFATC3 plays a pivotal role in immune response, cell growth, and apoptosis by translocating to the nucleus upon dephosphorylation by the phosphatase calcineurin, thereby influencing the transcription of target genes (Rao1997TRANSCRIPTION; Hogan2003Transcriptional). The gene is expressed in various tissues and is involved in critical physiological processes, including β-cell function in the pancreas and cardiac development. Dysregulation of NFATC3 has been implicated in several pathological conditions, such as Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Ma2021Expression; Zebardast2023Unveiling).

## Structure
NFATC3, a member of the NFAT family of transcription factors, is characterized by a DNA-binding domain similar to the Rel homology region found in Rel-family transcription factors. This domain is crucial for its function in DNA binding and dimerization (Rao1997TRANSCRIPTION). The NFATC3 protein includes a Rel homology domain (RHD) that facilitates its interaction with DNA, and it is known to undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which influence its activity and subcellular localization (Kitamura2020Identification).

The NFATC3 protein is also involved in interactions with calcineurin, a phosphatase that dephosphorylates NFAT proteins, promoting their translocation to the nucleus and enhancing their DNA-binding affinity (Hogan2003Transcriptional). The interaction with calcineurin is mediated by specific domains within NFATC3, including CNBR1 and CNBR2, which contribute to its binding affinity (Kitamura2020Identification).

NFATC3 exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can affect its functional properties and interactions with other proteins (Kitamura2020Identification). These isoforms may exhibit differences in their regulatory roles and responses to cellular signals, reflecting the complexity of NFATC3's involvement in immune response regulation.

## Function
NFATC3 (nuclear factor of activated T cells 3) is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in various cellular and molecular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in the regulation of gene expression in response to calcium signaling, primarily functioning in the nucleus where it influences the transcription of genes related to immune function, cell growth, and apoptosis. NFATC3 is part of the NFAT family of proteins, which are substrates of calcineurin. Upon dephosphorylation by calcineurin, NFAT proteins translocate into the nucleus to exert their effects (Chen2021Calcineurin).

In the context of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), NFATC3 is highly expressed in pancreatic islets, indicating its crucial role in β-cell function and glucose homeostasis. It is involved in the regulation of β-cell development and proliferation, which are essential for maintaining blood sugar balance. NFATC3's downregulation in T2DM is associated with impairments in insulin secretion and higher levels of HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose, highlighting its role in metabolic regulation (Zebardast2023Unveiling).

NFATC3 is also implicated in various signaling pathways, including the Wnt signaling pathway, which is important for β-cell function and insulin signaling (Zebardast2023Unveiling).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NFATC3 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and cardiovascular conditions. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), specifically lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), NFATC3 mRNA levels are significantly upregulated. This overexpression is associated with worse overall survival in LUAD, suggesting a potential oncogenic role for NFATC3 in this type of cancer (Ma2021Expression). 

In cardiac development, NFATC3, along with NFATc4, is crucial for maintaining proper cardiac function and mitochondrial integrity. Mice lacking both NFATc3 and NFATc4 exhibit severe cardiac defects, including thin ventricular walls and mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to embryonic lethality. These findings highlight the importance of NFATC3 in cardiac development and suggest that its dysregulation could contribute to congenital heart defects and mitochondrial disorders (Bushdid2003NFATc3).

Additionally, NFATC3 is involved in the development of retroperitoneal liposarcoma, where it is destabilized by the tumor suppressor linc00423, affecting the MAPK signaling pathway. This interaction underscores the role of NFATC3 in tumorigenesis and its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2019Linc00423).

## Interactions
NFATC3, a member of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) family, interacts with calcineurin (CNA), a phosphoprotein phosphatase involved in calcium signaling. The interaction between NFATC3 and calcineurin is mediated by specific domains within the NFATC3 protein. The CRD domain of NFATC3 shows specific binding to calcineurin, similar to other NFAT isoforms, although the contribution of individual domains like CNBR1 and CNBR2 varies. Notably, the CNBR3 region, which shows significant interaction with calcineurin in other NFAT isoforms such as NFATc1 and NFATc4, does not exhibit the same interaction in NFATC3 (Kitamura2020Identification).

The study of these interactions is crucial for understanding the regulation of T cell activation and function, as NFAT proteins play a significant role in cytokine gene expression. The binding interactions between NFATC3 and calcineurin were quantitatively assessed using immunoprecipitation methods, and the binding affinities were analyzed using SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting techniques (Kitamura2020Identification). These interactions highlight the unique binding properties of NFATC3 compared to other NFAT family members, suggesting potential isoform-specific regulatory mechanisms.
