# OXNAD1

## Overview
OXNAD1 is a gene that encodes the protein oxidoreductase NAD binding domain containing 1, which is involved in cellular redox reactions. This protein is categorized as an oxidoreductase, a class of enzymes that facilitate oxidation-reduction processes by transferring electrons from one molecule to another. The OXNAD1 gene has been implicated in various biological pathways, particularly those related to mitochondrial dynamics and metabolism, as it is responsive to PGC-1α and can be induced by AMPK agonists (NsiahSefaa2014New). Research has highlighted the gene's potential role in cancer biology, with mutations in its regulatory regions being associated with oncogenic processes and patient survival outcomes across multiple cancer types (SinnottArmstrong2020Convergent). Despite these associations, the precise functional implications of OXNAD1 in tumorigenesis and other disease contexts require further investigation (Pellegrini2017Understanding; Montano2024Biomarkers).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the regulatory regions of the OXNAD1 gene have been associated with various cancer types, impacting patient survival outcomes. Specifically, mutations in the promoter region of OXNAD1 are suggested to be oncogenic, with an expression-increasing, risk-decreasing association with survival across multiple cancer types (SinnottArmstrong2020Convergent). These mutations have been identified as potential non-coding cancer drivers, with significant expression changes and survival implications (SinnottArmstrong2020Convergent).

In melanoma and basal cell carcinoma (BCC), mutations in the DPH3-OXNAD1 promoter region, characterized by UV signature mutations, have been reported. These mutations occur near transcription factor binding motifs but do not appear to alter the expression levels of OXNAD1 in tumors, leaving their functional significance unclear (Pellegrini2017Understanding; Montano2024Biomarkers).

OXNAD1 has also been identified as a PGC-1α-responsive gene, with its expression induced by AMPK agonists, suggesting a role in mitochondrial dynamics and metabolism. However, the specific clinical significance of these regulatory interactions in disease contexts remains to be fully elucidated (NsiahSefaa2014New).
