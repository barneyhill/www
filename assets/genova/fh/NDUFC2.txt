# NDUFC2

## Overview
NDUFC2 is a gene that encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit C2, a component of mitochondrial complex I, which is integral to the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system. This protein is categorized as a subunit of an enzyme complex and is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it plays a pivotal role in cellular respiration by facilitating electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone. This process is essential for generating the proton motive force required for ATP synthesis, thereby supporting cellular energy production (Rubattu2016Ndufc2; Raffa2017In). NDUFC2 is crucial for the proper assembly and function of complex I, contributing to efficient ATP production and the regulation of oxidative stress by minimizing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation (Raffa2019The; Raffa2017In). The gene's expression and function are vital for maintaining mitochondrial health and preventing diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, such as diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular conditions (Gallo2023Polymorphic; Rubattu2016Ndufc2).

## Function
The NDUFC2 gene encodes a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which is a crucial component of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system. This complex is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and plays a vital role in cellular respiration by facilitating the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, contributing to the proton motive force necessary for ATP synthesis (Rubattu2016Ndufc2; Raffa2017In). 

In healthy human cells, NDUFC2 is essential for the proper assembly and activity of complex I, ensuring efficient ATP production and minimizing the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Raffa2019The; Raffa2017In). The protein helps maintain mitochondrial function and cellular energy balance, which is critical for various cellular activities and overall organismal health (Raffa2019The). 

NDUFC2 also plays a role in regulating oxidative stress by supporting antioxidant defense mechanisms, including the activity of superoxide dismutases (SOD) and uncoupling proteins (UCPs), which help eliminate excess ROS and maintain mitochondrial integrity (Raffa2019The). Proper function of NDUFC2 is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial health and preventing diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the NDUFC2 gene have been implicated in several diseases, primarily due to its role in mitochondrial function. NDUFC2 deficiency is associated with increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, contributing to conditions such as diabetes, cancer, and stroke (Raffa2017In). Specifically, the T allele of the rs11237379 variant is linked to reduced NDUFC2 expression and an increased risk of early-onset ischemic stroke (Rubattu2016Ndufc2; Raffa2017In). 

In hypertensive patients, polymorphic variants of NDUFC2, such as rs11237379 and rs641836, are associated with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). The TT genotype at rs11237379 is linked to reduced gene expression, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and increased oxidative stress, which contribute to cardiac hypertrophy (Gallo2023Polymorphic). 

NDUFC2 downregulation is also associated with mitochondrial dysfunction in stroke-prone models, where it leads to altered complex I assembly and increased stroke susceptibility (Rubattu2016Ndufc2). These findings highlight the gene's critical role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and its potential involvement in various pathologies related to mitochondrial dysfunction.

## Interactions
NDUFC2, a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, is involved in several interactions crucial for the assembly and function of the complex. It directly interacts with mtDNA-encoded subunits, particularly ND4, as confirmed by yeast two-hybrid experiments, which demonstrated growth on restrictive media when NDUFC2 was combined with ND4, indicating a direct interaction (Gershoni2010Coevolution). No interaction was observed with ND3, suggesting specificity in its interactions (Gershoni2010Coevolution).

The study also identified ND5 as a likely interaction partner for NDUFC2, supported by coevolution analysis and their shared subcomplex (Gershoni2010Coevolution). These interactions are essential for the assembly of the membrane arm of complex I, highlighting the role of NDUFC2 in the structural integrity and function of the complex (Gershoni2010Coevolution).

NDUFC2's interaction with ND4 suggests its incorporation into the membrane arm of complex I, potentially playing a significant role in the assembly process (Mimaki2012Understanding). These interactions provide insights into the molecular basis of complex I-related diseases and evolutionary processes, emphasizing the importance of NDUFC2 in mitochondrial function (Gershoni2010Coevolution).
