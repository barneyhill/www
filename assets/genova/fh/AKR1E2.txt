# AKR1E2

## Overview
AKR1E2 is a gene that encodes the protein aldo-keto reductase family 1 member E2, which is part of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily. This protein functions primarily as a reductase, catalyzing the conversion of carbonyl groups to alcohols, a critical process for detoxification and maintaining cellular redox balance (Penning2021AldoKeto; Barski2008The). AKR1E2 is predominantly expressed in the human testis, indicating a potential specialized role in spermatogenesis (Barski2008The). The enzyme's activity is crucial for intermediary metabolism and detoxification, contributing to cellular protection against oxidative stress and maintaining homeostasis (Penning2015The; Barski2008The).

## Function
AKR1E2, a member of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily, functions primarily as a reductase in human cells. It catalyzes the reduction of carbonyl groups to alcohols, a process crucial for detoxification and maintaining cellular redox balance (Penning2021AldoKeto; Barski2008The). Specifically, AKR1E2 acts on 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose, converting it to its corresponding alcohol form, which is then conjugated for elimination (Penning2021AldoKeto; Penning2015The).

AKR1E2 is expressed predominantly in the human testis, suggesting a specialized role in this tissue, potentially related to spermatogenesis (Barski2008The). The enzyme's activity is linked to the broader functions of the AKR superfamily, which includes the metabolism of hormones and the reduction of reactive aldehydes, contributing to cellular protection against oxidative stress (Mindnich2009Aldoketo; Barski2008The).

The protein is active in the cytoplasm, where it participates in intermediary metabolism and detoxification processes, helping to mitigate the effects of cellular stress and maintain homeostasis (Penning2015The; Barski2008The). This activity is essential for the proper functioning of cells and the organism as a whole, particularly in tissues with high metabolic demands.
