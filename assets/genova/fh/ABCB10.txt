# ABCB10

## Overview
ABCB10 is a gene that encodes the ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 10 protein, a crucial component of the mitochondrial inner membrane. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane transporter and functions as a homodimeric half transporter, playing a significant role in mitochondrial iron homeostasis and heme biosynthesis. The ABCB10 protein is involved in exporting molecules such as δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) from the mitochondria, which is essential for the early steps of heme synthesis. It also contributes to cellular protection against oxidative stress, particularly in erythroid cells and cardiac tissues. The gene's expression is vital for normal erythropoiesis and mitochondrial function, with its dysfunction linked to anemia and metabolic disorders (Shum2021ABCB10; Bayeva2013ATPBinding; Liesa2012Mitochondrial).

## Structure
ABCB10 is a human ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. The protein is a homodimeric half transporter, with each monomer consisting of transmembrane domains (TMDs) and nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) (Shintre2013Structures; Cao2023CryoEM). The primary structure includes amino acid sequences that form six long transmembrane α-helices and a short N-terminal α-helix (Shintre2013Structures). 

The secondary structure of ABCB10 is characterized by these α-helices, which are common in eukaryotic ABC transporters (Shintre2013Structures). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices into a functional transporter, with the NBDs responsible for ATP binding and hydrolysis, while the TMDs form the translocation pathway (Cao2023CryoEM). 

In terms of quaternary structure, ABCB10 functions as a homodimer, with the dimer generated by a crystallographic twofold axis (Shintre2013Structures). The protein exhibits flexibility in its conformation, adopting both inward-facing and outward-facing states depending on the presence of substrates and nucleotides (Cao2023CryoEM). 

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may occur, although specific modifications for ABCB10 are not detailed in the provided context. The protein's structure is stabilized by interactions with lipids like cardiolipin, which enhance its stability and function (Chen2015Localization).

## Function
ABCB10 is a mitochondrial ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it forms homodimers. Its nucleotide-binding domain faces the mitochondrial matrix, suggesting a role in exporting molecules out of mitochondria (Karwaciak2014Regulation; Liesa2012Mitochondrial). ABCB10 is highly expressed during erythroid differentiation and is crucial for heme biosynthesis, as it stabilizes mitoferrin-1, facilitating iron import into mitochondria, which is essential for hemoglobin synthesis (Seguin2017Reductions; Hyde2012The). 

The protein is involved in the early steps of heme synthesis, potentially exporting δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) from the mitochondria, a critical step in the heme biosynthetic pathway (Bayeva2013ATPBinding). ABCB10 also plays a significant role in protecting cells from oxidative stress, particularly in erythroid cells and cardiac tissues, by managing reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Liesa2012Mitochondrial). This protective function is crucial for normal erythropoiesis and cardiac recovery after ischemia-reperfusion events (Liesa2012Mitochondrial). ABCB10's activity is essential for mitochondrial function and red blood cell development, as evidenced by the embryonic lethality observed in ABCB10 knockout mice (Seguin2017Reductions; Hyde2012The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the ABCB10 gene can lead to significant clinical consequences, particularly affecting erythropoiesis and heme biosynthesis. ABCB10 is crucial for the proper development of red blood cells, and its dysfunction can result in anemia and related hematological disorders. For instance, ABCB10 knockout mice exhibit embryonic lethality due to severe anemia, characterized by impaired heme biosynthesis and increased apoptosis in erythroid precursors (Yamamoto2014Abcb10; Hyde2012The). This is attributed to the gene's role in protecting against oxidative stress and facilitating iron import into mitochondria, which is essential for heme production (Seguin2017Reductions).

Altered ABCB10 expression is also linked to metabolic conditions. In the context of obesity, increased ABCB10 expression in the liver is associated with insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis, contributing to conditions like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and type 2 diabetes (Shum2021ABCB10). Conversely, deletion of ABCB10 in the liver of obese mice has been shown to improve insulin signaling and protect against these metabolic disorders (Shum2021ABCB10). These findings highlight the gene's involvement in both hematological and metabolic pathologies, underscoring its clinical significance.

## Interactions
ABCB10 is known to interact with several proteins involved in erythroid heme biosynthesis and mitochondrial iron homeostasis. It forms an oligomeric complex with mitoferrin-1 (Mfrn1) and ferrochelatase (Fech) in erythroid cells. This complex facilitates the efficient transfer of iron imported by Mfrn1 to Fech for heme biosynthesis, with interactions confirmed through mass spectrometry and immunoprecipitation/Western blot analyses (Chen2010Ferrochelatase).

ABCB10 also physically interacts with Mfrn1, enhancing its stability and function, which is crucial for mitochondrial iron import necessary for heme and Fe/S cluster synthesis during erythroid maturation. This interaction is specific to Mfrn1 and does not occur with mitoferrin-2 (Mfrn2) (Chen2009Abcb10).

In addition to its role in heme biosynthesis, ABCB10 has been identified as a biliverdin exporter. It binds biliverdin in a hydrophobic pocket, forming a closed conformation that involves interactions with cholesterol, which may act as a cofactor in the export process (Cao2023CryoEM). These interactions highlight ABCB10's multifaceted role in mitochondrial function and cellular iron regulation.
