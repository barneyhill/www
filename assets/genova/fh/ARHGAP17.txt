# ARHGAP17

## Overview
ARHGAP17 is a gene that encodes the Rho GTPase activating protein 17, a critical regulator of the Rho family of GTPases, including Rac1 and Cdc42. This protein is categorized as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) and plays a pivotal role in modulating the actin cytoskeleton, thereby influencing cell shape, motility, and polarity (Lee2016Arhgap17; Wang2020ARHGAP17). ARHGAP17 is involved in maintaining the integrity of tight junctions in epithelial cells and is crucial for cellular processes such as cell migration and adhesion (Nagy2015Cyclic; Lee2016Arhgap17). The protein's activity is regulated through phosphorylation and interactions with other proteins, which are essential for its function in cellular signaling pathways and cytoskeletal dynamics (Nagy2015Cyclic; KreiderLetterman2022ARHGAP17). ARHGAP17's role extends to clinical significance, where its dysregulation is implicated in various diseases, including inflammatory bowel diseases, myelodysplastic syndromes, and several types of cancer (Lee2016Arhgap17; Yang2021Transcriptomic; Fang2016Ubiquitination).

## Structure
ARHGAP17, also known as Rho GTPase activating protein 17, is characterized by several structural domains that contribute to its function. It contains a RhoGAP domain, which is crucial for its GTPase-activating function, specifically targeting Rho family GTPases such as Rac1 and Cdc42 (Aspenström2018BAR; KreiderLetterman2022ARHGAP17). The protein also features a proline-rich region, which includes predicted SH3-binding sites and a PDZ-binding motif, facilitating protein-protein interactions (Nagy2015Cyclic). 

ARHGAP17 has an N-terminal BAR domain, which is involved in membrane deformation and may regulate membrane curvature (Huang2017Rho). This domain is sometimes referred to as an "endophilin-like domain" and is categorized as an N-BAR domain, playing a role in targeting the GAP domain to its membrane substrate (Aspenström2018BAR).

Phosphorylation is a significant post-translational modification for ARHGAP17, particularly at serine 702, which affects its interaction with other proteins such as CIP4 and influences its regulatory functions (Nagy2015Cyclic). The phosphorylation of ARHGAP17 by cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases like PKA and PKG is crucial for its activity in platelets (Nagy2015Cyclic). 

The protein's structure and modifications enable it to play a vital role in cellular processes such as cytoskeletal dynamics and cell migration.

## Function
ARHGAP17 encodes a Rho GTPase activating protein that plays a crucial role in regulating the activity of the Rho family of GTPases, particularly Rac1 and Cdc42. These GTPases are involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for maintaining cell shape, polarity, and motility (Lee2016Arhgap17; Wang2020ARHGAP17). ARHGAP17 functions by stimulating the intrinsic GTPase activity of these proteins, leading to their inactivation and thus modulating cellular architecture and function (Nagy2015Cyclic).

In epithelial cells, ARHGAP17 is involved in maintaining the integrity of tight junctions, which are critical for epithelial barrier function. It interacts with scaffolding proteins like angiomotin to regulate these junctions, ensuring proper cell-cell adhesion and barrier integrity (Lee2016Arhgap17). In the context of mechanical stress, such as in periodontal ligament fibroblasts, ARHGAP17 helps protect against apoptosis by inactivating Rac1/Cdc42, highlighting its role in cellular stress responses (Wang2020ARHGAP17).

ARHGAP17 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and at cell junctions, where it influences cell shape and motility, playing a significant role in processes like cell migration and adhesion (Nagy2015Cyclic).

## Clinical Significance
ARHGAP17 has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in regulating cellular processes. In the context of inflammatory bowel diseases, ARHGAP17 is crucial for maintaining mucosal and epithelial barrier function in the colon. Deficiency in ARHGAP17 leads to increased susceptibility to colitis, as seen in mouse models, suggesting a potential risk factor for ulcerative colitis (Lee2016Arhgap17).

In myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), alternative splicing of ARHGAP17, particularly the exclusion of exon 18, results in reduced expression and increased activation of Cdc42. This alteration impairs hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell function, contributing to aberrant hematopoiesis in MDS (Fang2016Ubiquitination).

In cancer, ARHGAP17 expression is associated with tumor progression. In bladder cancer, higher expression of ARHGAP17 correlates with a tumor-promoting microenvironment, affecting immune cell infiltration and function, and is linked to poor prognosis (Yang2021Transcriptomic). In cervical cancer, ARHGAP17 acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, and its downregulation is associated with increased tumor growth (Guo2019ARHGAP17). In breast cancer, ARHGAP17 is involved in cell migration through the VEGF/NRP1 signaling pathway, influencing disease progression (Kiso2018Long).

## Interactions
ARHGAP17, also known as Rho GTPase activating protein 17, participates in several protein interactions that influence cellular functions. It is a substrate for cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases, specifically PKA and PKG, which phosphorylate ARHGAP17 at serine 702. This phosphorylation affects its interaction with the actin-regulating protein CIP4, leading to the dissociation of the ARHGAP17-CIP4 complex. This interaction is mediated through the SH3 domain of CIP4 and the proline-rich region of ARHGAP17, with phosphorylation at Ser-702 playing a critical role in modulating this interaction (Nagy2015Cyclic).

ARHGAP17 also interacts with NHERF1 (EBP50) via its C-terminal PDZ-binding motif, a stable interaction that is not disrupted by phosphorylation (Nagy2015Cyclic). In the context of invadopodia dynamics, ARHGAP17 interacts with Cdc42, a small GTPase, to regulate its activity. This interaction is crucial for the formation and turnover of invadopodia, with ARHGAP17 localizing to the invadopodia ring and core, influencing Cdc42 activity and invadopodia disassembly (KreiderLetterman2022ARHGAP17). These interactions highlight ARHGAP17's role in modulating cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular signaling pathways.
