# ATOSB

## Overview
The ATOSB gene encodes the atos homolog B protein, which is a member of the kinase family. This protein plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and regulation of metabolic pathways. As a kinase, atos homolog B is involved in the phosphorylation of specific substrates, thereby modulating their activity and function within the cell. The gene and its encoded protein have been implicated in several biological pathways, including the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway, which is significant for cellular growth and differentiation (Qiu2020aarFDC). Understanding the function and regulation of ATOSB is essential for elucidating its role in health and disease.
