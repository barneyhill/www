# FAM133B

## Overview
FAM133B is a gene that encodes the protein family with sequence similarity 133 member B, which is involved in various cellular processes. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is implicated in the regulation of cellular growth and differentiation. FAM133B has been studied for its role in cancer biology, particularly in colorectal and bladder cancers, where its expression levels and mutations have been associated with disease progression and prognosis (Mini2019RNA). Additionally, FAM133B is linked to neurological disorders such as hereditary spastic paraplegia, highlighting its diverse functional roles in human health and disease (Bujko2021Differential).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
FAM133B has been implicated in various cancers and neurological disorders. In the context of cancer, FAM133B is associated with poor prognosis in stage III colorectal cancer patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. It is one of the differentially expressed genes identified in patients with unfavorable outcomes, suggesting its potential role in cancer progression (Mini2019RNA). Additionally, FAM133B has been identified in a gene fusion with CDK6, which has oncogenic potential, as demonstrated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Shugay2013Oncofuse:).

In bladder cancer, a mutation in FAM133B (p.Q214R) was detected, indicating its presence in tumor samples and suggesting a possible role in the disease's genetic landscape (Ramsey2017Cross‐species). Furthermore, FAM133B expression is altered in corticotroph pituitary tumors with USP8 mutations, where it shows a negative correlation with miRNA expression, highlighting its involvement in protein ubiquitination processes (Bujko2021Differential).

Beyond cancer, FAM133B mutations or altered expression have been linked to hereditary spastic paraplegia, a neurological disorder characterized by progressive weakness and spasticity of the legs. This association underscores the gene's significance in both oncological and neurological conditions.
