# DAB2

## Overview
The DAB2 gene encodes the Disabled-2 (Dab2) protein, a cytoplasmic adaptor protein that plays a pivotal role in endocytosis and signal transduction. Dab2 is characterized by its phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, which facilitates interactions with other proteins and phospholipids, and a proline-rich domain (PRD) that mediates binding with the adaptor protein Grb2, implicating it in signal transduction pathways (Xu1998Disabled2). The protein is involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and regulates several signaling pathways, including TGF-β and Wnt, influencing cellular processes such as differentiation, proliferation, and migration (Morris2001Disabled‐2; Hocevar2001The). Dab2's expression is notably downregulated in various cancers, where it functions as a tumor suppressor, and it also plays a role in immune regulation, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target (Figliuolo2020Emerging; Tong2010Putative).

## Structure
The DAB2 protein, also known as Disabled homolog 2, is a cytoplasmic adaptor protein involved in endocytosis and signal transduction. It contains several functional domains, including a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, which is crucial for its interactions with other proteins (Xu1998Disabled2). The PTB domain is similar to the phosphotyrosine binding/phosphotyrosine interaction (PTB/PI) domain and is involved in protein-protein and protein-phospholipid interactions (Yun2003Crystal).

The DAB2 protein also features a proline-rich domain (PRD) at its C-terminus, which mediates interaction with the adaptor protein Grb2. This interaction requires both SH3 domains of Grb2 for cooperative binding, suggesting a role in signal transduction pathways (Xu1998Disabled2). The PRD allows DAB2 to compete with Sos for Grb2 binding, potentially regulating Ras activation (Xu1998Disabled2).

DAB2 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its activity and interactions (Xu1998Disabled2). Multiple splice variants of DAB2 exist, contributing to its functional diversity (Sheng2000Structure). The gene is expressed in various tissues, including epithelial cells of the breast and ovary, and its loss is associated with tumorigenesis (Sheng2000Structure).

## Function
The DAB2 gene encodes the Disabled-2 (Dab2) protein, which functions as an adaptor protein involved in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, Dab2 plays a crucial role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis by interacting with clathrin and the AP-2 complex, facilitating the internalization of receptors such as the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) (Morris2001Disabled‐2). Dab2 is also involved in the regulation of signaling pathways, including the TGF-β and Wnt pathways. In the TGF-β pathway, Dab2 links TGF-β receptors to the Smad family of proteins, facilitating Smad2 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, which are essential for transcriptional responses (Hocevar2001The). In the Wnt signaling pathway, Dab2 interacts with components like Dvl3 and Axin, modulating the pathway's activation and influencing processes such as cell differentiation and proliferation (Roy2024Dab2).

Dab2 is active in the cytoplasm and at the cell membrane, where it regulates cell adhesion, migration, and angiogenesis. It acts as a negative regulator of Src activation, affecting focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling pathways, which are crucial for endothelial cell function (Orlandini2008Morphogenesis). Dab2's involvement in these molecular processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the DAB2 gene are implicated in various cancers. DAB2 is frequently downregulated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) due to promoter hypermethylation, which is associated with the loss of its tumor-suppressive functions. This downregulation is linked to increased cell proliferation and colony formation in NPC cells (Tong2010Putative). In ovarian cancer, DAB2 is considered an early marker of tumorigenesis, with its expression varying between subtypes (Price2022Disabled2). The gene is also downregulated in breast, lung, bladder, prostate, cervix, and stomach cancers, often correlating with poor patient outcomes, such as reduced overall survival and increased metastasis (Price2022Disabled2).

In immune regulation, DAB2 plays a role in controlling inflammation. Its downregulation in dendritic cells is associated with exacerbated immune responses in inflammatory bowel diseases and autoimmune conditions like Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (Figliuolo2020Emerging). DAB2 also influences macrophage phenotypes and is involved in preventing excessive inflammation, suggesting its protective role against immune-related disorders (Price2022Disabled2). The gene's interactions with signaling pathways, such as MAPK and TGFβ, further highlight its significance in both cancer progression and immune regulation (Price2022Disabled2).

## Interactions
DAB2 (Disabled-2) is an adaptor protein that participates in various protein interactions, playing a crucial role in cellular processes such as endocytosis and signal transduction. DAB2 interacts with the AP-2 complex, colocalizing in clathrin-coated pits. This interaction is mediated by specific regions of DAB2, particularly the DPF sequences, which bind to the a-adaptin subunit of AP-2. The binding is primarily mediated by residues 206-350, although maximal interaction requires a larger region with multiple binding sites (Morris2001Disabled‐2).

DAB2 also interacts with the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) in clathrin-coated pits. The phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain of DAB2 binds to NPXY-containing peptides in the cytoplasmic tails of LDLR, facilitating receptor internalization (Morris2001Disabled‐2).

In the context of signal transduction, DAB2 interacts with Smad2 and Smad3 proteins in the transforming growth factor beta (TGFb) signaling pathway. This interaction is crucial for TGFb-induced Smad2 phosphorylation and transcriptional responses. DAB2 associates with both type I and type II TGFb receptors, forming part of a multiprotein signaling complex (Hocevar2001The).

DAB2 also binds to Grb2, an adaptor protein involved in the Ras signaling pathway. This interaction is mediated by the proline-rich domain of DAB2, which competes with Sos for Grb2 binding, potentially modulating growth factor/Ras pathways (Xu1998Disabled2).
