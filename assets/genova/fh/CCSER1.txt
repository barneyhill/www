# CCSER1

## Overview
The CCSER1 gene encodes the coiled-coil serine rich protein 1, a protein integral to cellular processes, particularly in mitosis and chromosomal stability. This protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, and its serine-rich composition, which suggests potential post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation. CCSER1 plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability by localizing to the mitotic spindle and other cellular structures during cell division, ensuring accurate chromosome segregation. Its involvement in cellular stability and division highlights its importance in preventing chromosomal instability, a factor in oncogenesis (Santoliquido2021Deletion; Yang2023Polymorphisms). The gene's expression is regulated by antisense transcription, which influences its role in mitotic stability (Santoliquido2021Deletion).

## Structure
The CCSER1 gene encodes a protein characterized by coiled-coil domains, which are known to facilitate protein-protein interactions. The primary structure of the CCSER1 protein is rich in serine residues, with 23 serines located within the first 69 amino acids (Yang2023Polymorphisms). The secondary structure likely includes alpha helices formed by these coiled-coil regions, although specific details on the tertiary and quaternary structures are not provided in the available literature.

The CCSER1 protein has been associated with various splice variant isoforms, which may have different functional properties. One such isoform, r-CCSER1, lacks a central portion of the gene but still colocalizes to the centrosome during all cell cycle stages, despite missing the coiled-coil interaction domain (Santoliquido2021Deletion). This suggests that the protein may have a modular architecture, allowing it to maintain certain functions even when parts of its structure are altered.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are likely due to the serine-rich nature of the protein, although specific modifications have not been detailed in the context provided. The protein's role in cellular processes, particularly in mitosis and chromosomal stability, underscores its importance in both normal cellular function and oncogenesis (Santoliquido2021Deletion).

## Function
The CCSER1 gene, also known as FAM190A, encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in mitotic processes and cell division in healthy human cells. It is involved in maintaining proper mitotic function by localizing at the mitotic spindle, which is essential for accurate chromosome segregation during cell division (Santoliquido2021Deletion). The CCSER1 protein is characterized by coiled-coil domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, contributing to cytoskeletal organization and cell stability. This structural role is vital for maintaining genomic stability and preventing chromosomal instability, which can lead to oncogenic transformations (Yang2023Polymorphisms).

In terms of cellular localization, CCSER1 is active in various cellular compartments, including the γ-microtubulin ring complex during early mitosis and an intermediate structure during late cytokinesis (Yang2023Polymorphisms). This localization underscores its role in ensuring proper cell division and genomic integrity. The regulation of CCSER1 expression is influenced by antisense transcription through the TMSB4XP8 pseudogene, which modulates its expression levels and impacts mitotic stability (Santoliquido2021Deletion). Overall, CCSER1 is integral to normal mitotic progression and cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
The CCSER1 gene, also known as coiled-coil serine rich protein 1, has been implicated in several diseases due to mutations, alterations in expression levels, or disruptions in its normal interactions. In the context of cancer, CCSER1 is frequently lost in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and other cancers, contributing to chromosomal instability (CIN) through its role in cell division. Its knockdown can result in cytokinesis failure, multipolar spindles, and multinucleated cells, suggesting that its deletion may lead to CIN in cancers (Gollin2014Cytogenetic).

CCSER1 has also been associated with neurological disorders. In Parkinson's disease, the gene is disrupted in cases involving the triplication of the SNCA locus, which affects its expression and may contribute to disease pathogenesis (Prahl2022Genetic; Zafar2018Genetic). Additionally, CCSER1 is linked to other conditions such as diabetic neuropathy, substance abuse, and peripheral artery disease, although these associations are less frequently documented (Prahl2022Genetic).

Overall, the clinical significance of CCSER1 is underscored by its involvement in various diseases, primarily through its impact on cellular division and stability.
