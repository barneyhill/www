# TTK

## Overview
TTK, also known as Mps1, is a gene that encodes the TTK protein kinase, a dual-specificity kinase involved in critical cellular processes such as the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) during mitosis. This kinase plays a pivotal role in ensuring accurate chromosome alignment and segregation, thereby maintaining genomic stability and preventing aneuploidy. TTK protein kinase is characterized by its ability to phosphorylate serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues, which is essential for its function in cellular signaling pathways related to cell proliferation and cycle regulation. The protein is active in the nucleus and centrosomes of proliferating cells, highlighting its importance in cell cycle control and growth factor signaling. TTK's conservation across species underscores its fundamental role in cellular growth and proliferation, making it a significant focus of research in cancer biology due to its overexpression in various malignancies and potential as a therapeutic target (Malumbres2011Physiological; Chen2019Silencing; Mills1992Expression).

## Structure
TTK protein kinase, also known as Mps1, is a dual-specificity kinase involved in mitotic checkpoint signaling and error correction during cell division. The primary structure of TTK consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain, which includes a C-terminal kinase domain and an N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain (Pachis2018Leader). The TPR domain is formed by three tandem TPRs and a seventh helix, structurally similar to the TPR domains of other spindle assembly checkpoint proteins like Bub1 and BubR1, indicating a shared evolutionary ancestry (Pachis2018Leader).

The tertiary structure of TTK includes a kinase domain crucial for its enzymatic activity, with specific structural features such as the hydrophobic R-spine, the αC-helix, and the activation loop, which are essential for its catalytic function (Dodson2013The). TTK can form dimers, suggesting a quaternary structure that facilitates its activation through trans-autophosphorylation (Pachis2018Leader).

Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating TTK's activity and localization. Phosphorylation by Aurora B kinase and other kinases affects TTK's binding and activation at kinetochores (Pachis2018Leader). Splice variants of TTK may exist, leading to different isoforms, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
TTK, also known as Mps1, is a dual-specificity protein kinase that plays a crucial role in the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) during cell division. This checkpoint is essential for ensuring proper chromosome alignment and segregation, thereby maintaining genomic stability and preventing aneuploidy. TTK is involved in recruiting several checkpoint proteins, including Mad1 and Mad2, to the kinetochore, which is vital for the SAC's functionality (Malumbres2011Physiological; Chen2019Silencing).

In healthy human cells, TTK is active in the nucleus and centrosomes, where it contributes to cell cycle regulation and progression. It is particularly important during mitosis, where it ensures that mitosis only proceeds when the spindle and chromosomes are correctly paired and aligned (Chen2019Silencing). TTK's kinase activity involves the phosphorylation of serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues, which is critical for its role in cellular signaling processes related to cell proliferation (Mills1992Expression).

The presence of TTK in proliferating tissues and its conservation across species underscore its importance in cellular growth and proliferation, suggesting a role in cell cycle control and growth factor signaling (Mills1992Expression).

## Clinical Significance
The TTK gene, also known as Mps1, is implicated in various cancers due to its role in cell cycle regulation and the spindle assembly checkpoint. Overexpression of TTK is associated with poor prognosis and aggressive cancer phenotypes. In endometrial cancer, high TTK expression correlates with tumor metastasis, advanced TNM stage, and poor survival outcomes, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for poor prognosis and a target for immunotherapy (Du2024Upregulation). In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), TTK is overexpressed and necessary for cancer cell proliferation and survival, with its inhibition leading to chromosomal instability and reduced tumor growth (Kaistha2014Key; Stratford2017Genetic).

In prostate cancer, silencing TTK expression results in increased apoptosis and reduced cell invasion, indicating its role in cancer progression (Chen2019Silencing). TTK is also overexpressed in breast cancer, particularly in triple-negative subtypes, where it correlates with worse overall survival and sensitivity to TTK inhibitors (King2018TTK). In colon cancer, TTK promotes proliferation and inhibits differentiation, affecting tumor growth and progression (Zhang2019Mitotic). Additionally, TTK mutations are linked to gastric and colorectal cancers with microsatellite instability, contributing to cancer pathogenesis (Ahn2009Mutational).

## Interactions
TTK protein kinase, also known as Mps1, is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cell cycle regulation and DNA damage response. TTK interacts with proteins such as CHK2, BLM, and PLK1, which are involved in cell cycle regulation and DNA damage response. TTK phosphorylates CHK2, enhancing DNA damage checkpoint activation, and promotes BLM phosphorylation, ensuring accurate chromosome segregation (Maire2013TTKhMPS1).

In the context of cancer, TTK is overexpressed in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and is associated with the mitotic checkpoint, preventing chromosome mis-segregation and aneuploidy. Depletion of TTK in TNBC cells leads to reduced viability, decreased colony formation, and increased apoptosis, highlighting its role in maintaining cell viability and proliferation (Maire2013TTKhMPS1).

TTK also interacts with signaling pathways in colon cancer, where it enhances cell proliferation through the activation of the PKCα/ERK1/2 pathway and inhibits differentiation by inactivating the PI3K/Akt pathway. This interaction affects the expression of differentiation markers such as MUC2 and TFF3, suggesting TTK's role in preventing differentiation into a goblet cell phenotype (Zhang2019Mitotic).
