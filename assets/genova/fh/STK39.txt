# STK39

## Overview
STK39 is a gene that encodes the serine/threonine kinase 39, commonly referred to as SPAK, which is a member of the STE20 kinase family. This protein plays a pivotal role in regulating ion transport and maintaining cellular homeostasis. SPAK is primarily involved in the phosphorylation and activation of cation-chloride cotransporters, which are crucial for ion balance and cell volume regulation (Delpire2007SPAK; Gagnon2012Molecular). The protein is characterized by a classic bi-lobal kinase fold and can form domain-swapped dimers, which are significant for its regulatory functions (PonceCoria2012Calciumbinding; Taylor2015DomainSwapping). SPAK's activity is modulated by its phosphorylation state, which is influenced by upstream kinases, impacting processes such as blood pressure regulation and electrolyte balance (Gagnon2012Molecular). Beyond its role in ion transport, SPAK is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and cytoskeleton rearrangement, underscoring the gene's importance in physiological homeostasis (Bazot2018EpsteinBarr).

## Structure
The STK39 gene encodes the SPAK protein, a serine/threonine kinase involved in ion transport regulation. The primary structure of SPAK includes a proline and alanine-rich region known as the PAPA box, located upstream of the catalytic domain in the N-terminus (Gagnon2012Molecular). The secondary structure features a classic bi-lobal kinase fold with specific β sheets and α helices, essential for its catalytic activity (Gagnon2012Molecular). 

The tertiary structure of SPAK reveals a canonical two-domain kinase fold, with domain-swapped activation loops observed in certain mutant forms, such as SPAK T243D (Taylor2015DomainSwapping). This domain swapping is significant for its regulatory function and influences substrate specificity (Taylor2015DomainSwapping). The kinase domain is located near the N-terminus, while two conserved domains, PF1 and PF2, are at the C-terminus. The PF1 domain is crucial for kinase activity, and the PF2 domain is involved in protein-protein interactions (Taylor2015DomainSwapping).

In terms of quaternary structure, SPAK can form domain-swapped dimers, which are important for its function, although monomeric forms are also active (PonceCoria2012Calciumbinding). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which are critical for its activation and function (Gagnon2012Molecular).

## Function
The STK39 gene encodes the SPAK protein, a member of the STE20 kinase family, which plays a critical role in regulating ion transport and cellular homeostasis in healthy human cells. SPAK is involved in the phosphorylation and activation of cation-chloride cotransporters (CCCs) such as NKCC1 and NKCC2, which are essential for maintaining ion balance and cell volume regulation (Delpire2007SPAK; Gagnon2012Molecular). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cell volume and osmoregulation (Delpire2007SPAK).

SPAK functions as a key intermediary in the WNK-SPAK/OSR1-NCC signaling pathway, which is crucial for sodium and potassium balance. This pathway is regulated by dietary salt intake and hormones like aldosterone and angiotensin II, affecting sodium reabsorption and blood pressure (Gagnon2012Molecular). SPAK's phosphorylation state, influenced by upstream kinases such as WNK4, is vital for its activity and interaction with other proteins, impacting processes like blood pressure regulation and electrolyte balance (Gagnon2012Molecular).

In addition to its role in ion transport, SPAK is involved in broader cellular processes, including cell differentiation, transformation, and cytoskeleton rearrangement (Bazot2018EpsteinBarr). These functions underscore the importance of STK39 in maintaining cellular and physiological homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the STK39 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions. In hypertension, specific polymorphisms and haplotypes in the STK39 gene are associated with an increased risk, particularly among northeastern Han Chinese populations. These genetic variations may affect blood pressure regulation by altering renal salt handling and blood pressure set points (Zhao2014Interactive). 

In the context of cancer, STK39 is overexpressed in various malignancies, including small cell carcinoma of the cervix, breast cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Its overexpression is linked to advanced tumor stages and poor prognosis. In hepatocellular carcinoma, STK39 promotes tumor proliferation and invasion through the TGF-β1/Smad2/3 pathway, and its silencing inhibits these processes (Qiu2023Quantitative; Wang2021Transcription).

STK39 has also been associated with autism spectrum disorders. Specific SNPs within the gene show significant associations with autism, suggesting that alterations in STK39 may contribute to the condition (Ramoz2008An). These findings highlight the gene's potential role in various diseases, emphasizing the need for further research into its clinical significance.

## Interactions
STK39, also known as SPAK, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), STK39 interacts with the transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)/Smad2/3 signaling pathway, promoting cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Wang2021Transcription). The transcription factor specificity protein 1 (SP1) binds to the promoter of STK39, upregulating its expression and facilitating these processes (Wang2021Transcription).

In small cell carcinoma of the cervix (SCCC), STK39 interacts with polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) to activate the MAPK signaling pathway, enhancing tumor proliferation and aggression (Qiu2023Quantitative). In osteosarcoma, STK39 is involved in the TGF-β/Smad2/3 signaling pathway, affecting cell proliferation and invasion (Huang2017STK39).

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), STK39 is targeted by Lycium barbarum miRNA166a (Lb-miR166a), which downregulates its expression and inhibits the MAPK14 pathway, impacting cell proliferation and invasion (Hou2024Crossborder). In B-cell lymphomas, the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) protein EBNA3A silences STK39 by binding to its genomic locus, involving the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and the epigenetic mark H3K27me3 (Bazot2018EpsteinBarr).
