# FGF13

## Overview
FGF13 is a gene that encodes the protein fibroblast growth factor 13, a member of the fibroblast growth factor family known for its diverse roles in cellular processes, particularly within the nervous system. The FGF13 protein functions primarily as a microtubule-stabilizing protein, which is crucial for neuronal polarization, migration, and development. It interacts with tubulin to promote microtubule polymerization and stabilization, thereby supporting neuronal structure and function (Wu2012Fibroblast). Additionally, FGF13 is involved in regulating synaptic excitatory-inhibitory balance and modulating signaling pathways in various cell types, including skeletal muscle cells and neurons (Puranam2015Disruption; Lu2015FGF13). Mutations in the FGF13 gene have been linked to neurological disorders such as intellectual disability and epilepsy, highlighting its clinical significance (DeStefano2013Position; Pan20215’UTR).

## Function
Fibroblast Growth Factor 13 (FGF13) is a member of the fibroblast growth factor family that plays a crucial role in cellular processes, particularly in the nervous system. FGF13 functions as a microtubule-stabilizing protein, which is essential for neuronal polarization and migration. It interacts directly with tubulin, promoting microtubule polymerization and stabilization, thereby supporting the structural integrity and dynamics necessary for proper neuronal development (Wu2012Fibroblast).

FGF13 is localized in the cytoplasm, filopodia, and neurites of neurons, and it accumulates in the growth cones of axons, where it colocalizes with microtubules. This localization is critical for its role in microtubule dynamics, which is vital for axon formation and neuronal migration (Wu2012Fibroblast). In the context of skeletal muscle cells, FGF13 acts as a negative regulator of myoblast differentiation by modulating the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, which affects cell proliferation and differentiation (Lu2015FGF13).

FGF13 is also involved in maintaining synaptic excitatory-inhibitory balance, which is crucial for normal neuronal excitability and function. Disruption of FGF13 can lead to synaptic imbalances and neurological disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining proper neuronal function (Puranam2015Disruption).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FGF13 gene have been linked to several neurological disorders, primarily intellectual disability (ID) and epilepsy. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of FGF13 has been associated with severe intellectual disability in Chinese Han children. This SNP causes a translational defect by reducing the binding of RNA-binding proteins PTBP1 and PTBP2, leading to decreased FGF13 protein levels and impaired neuronal development (Pan20215’UTR). The mutation follows an X-linked recessive inheritance pattern and is particularly enriched in male patients with severe ID (Pan20215’UTR).

In addition to intellectual disability, FGF13 mutations have been implicated in epilepsy. A chromosome translocation disrupting FGF13 has been observed in a family with genetic epilepsy and cognitive impairment, suggesting its involvement in epilepsy pathogenesis (Pan20215’UTR). Furthermore, FGF13 is involved in X-linked congenital generalized hypertrichosis (CGH), where a 389-kb interchromosomal insertion at Xq27.1 leads to reduced FGF13 expression, potentially contributing to the hypertrichosis phenotype (DeStefano2013Position). These findings underscore the clinical significance of FGF13 in various neurological and developmental disorders.

## Interactions
FGF13 interacts with several proteins and plays a role in various cellular processes. In A549 cells, a non-small cell lung cancer line, FGF13 interacts with SHCBP1, a member of the Src homolog and collagen homolog (Shc) family. This interaction activates the AKT-GSK3α/β signaling pathway, promoting cell proliferation by enhancing the transition from the G1 to S phase of the cell cycle (Lu2020FGF13). The interaction between FGF13 and SHCBP1 was confirmed using yeast two-hybrid screening and co-immunoprecipitation assays (Lu2020FGF13).

In the context of neuronal development, FGF13 interacts with microtubules and is identified as a microtubule-stabilizing protein. It directly binds to tubulin through a tubulin-binding domain, which is crucial for neuronal polarization and migration (Wu2012Fibroblast). FGF13 also interacts with ARID1B, a component of the BAF chromatin remodeling complex, in neural stem cells. This interaction is part of an epigenomic mechanism that affects the state transition of neural stem cells during post-natal development (Yang2021Nuclear).

FGF13 is also involved in the regulation of voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) in hippocampal neurons, where it promotes VGSC endocytosis from the soma (Pablo2016Polarized).
