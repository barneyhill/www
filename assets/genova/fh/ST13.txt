# ST13

## Overview
The ST13 gene encodes the Hsp70 interacting protein (Hip), a co-chaperone that plays a pivotal role in the molecular chaperone system, particularly in the Hsp70 chaperone cycle. Hip is characterized as a dimeric protein with a molecular weight of approximately 43 kDa per subunit, and it is categorized as a co-chaperone due to its involvement in protein folding and stabilization processes. The protein is composed of several domains, including a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, which is crucial for its interaction with the ATPase domain of Hsp70. This interaction is essential for stabilizing Hsp70-substrate complexes, thereby preventing premature substrate release and enhancing the chaperone activity of Hsp70. Hip's function is vital for maintaining protein homeostasis, particularly under stress conditions, and it is implicated in the regulation of protein folding and degradation pathways. The ST13 gene and its encoded protein have significant clinical relevance, with alterations in their expression linked to various diseases, including cancer and chronic pancreatitis (Heldens2010Cochaperones; Li2013Structure).

## Structure
The ST13 gene encodes the Hsp70 interacting protein (Hip), a co-chaperone that plays a crucial role in the Hsp70 chaperone cycle. Hip is a dimeric protein with a molecular weight of approximately 43 kDa per subunit and consists of five domains: an N-terminal dimerization domain, a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, and a conserved C-terminal region with GGMP peptide repeats and a DP domain (Li2013Structure). The dimerization domain forms a compact, α-helical structure stabilized by van-der-Waals interactions and hydrogen bonds (Li2013Structure).

The TPR domain, located between residues 113-214, is essential for binding to the ATPase domain of Hsp70 and is involved in interactions with chemokine receptors CXCR2 and CXCR4 (Li2013Structure). The TPR domain of Hip is a versatile scaffold for protein-protein interactions, supporting both extended peptide motifs and surface motifs in folded proteins (Li2013Structure).

Hip forms an elongated dimer, as indicated by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis, with folded domains connected by long, negatively-charged linkers (Li2013Structure). This structure allows Hip to bind two Hsp70 molecules simultaneously, stabilizing the ADP-bound state of Hsp70 (Li2013Structure). Hip's interaction with Hsp70 is preferential for the ADP-bound state, with a dissociation constant (K D) of 8 µM (Li2013Structure).

## Function
The ST13 gene encodes the Hsp70 interacting protein (Hip), which functions as a co-chaperone in the Hsp70 chaperone system. Hip plays a crucial role in stabilizing Hsp70-substrate complexes by binding to the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) of Hsp70 in its ADP-bound state. This interaction prevents premature substrate release, thereby enhancing the chaperone activity of Hsp70 and facilitating protein folding and stabilization under stress conditions (Li2013Structure).

Hip is a dimeric protein that can bind independently to two Hsp70 molecules, and its structure includes a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain crucial for binding to Hsp70's ATPase domain (Li2013Structure). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and is involved in maintaining protein homeostasis by stabilizing complexes with aggregation-prone proteins, such as α-synuclein and Tau, which are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's (Li2013Structure).

Hip competes with nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs) for binding to Hsp70, thereby modulating the chaperone cycle and influencing protein folding and degradation pathways (Li2013Structure). This regulatory function is essential for cellular stress responses and organismal health (Heldens2010Cochaperones).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ST13 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly various forms of cancer. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), ST13 is poorly expressed, and this reduced expression is associated with increased cancer metastasis, microvascular invasion, and poor prognosis. Higher ST13 expression correlates with better survival rates, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor in PDAC (Zhang2020Oncolytic). 

In colorectal cancer, ST13 is downregulated compared to normal mucosal tissues. Its overexpression has been shown to inhibit tumor growth and induce apoptosis, indicating its function as a tumor suppressor gene specific to colorectal cancer (Zhou2012Potent; Yu2009Potent). 

ST13 is also involved in chronic pancreatitis (CP), where it protects against acinar cell injury and regulates lipid metabolism and inflammation. The absence of ST13 exacerbates fibrosis and fat deposition in CP, highlighting its protective role in this condition (Cao2022St13). 

In melanoma, ST13 is highly expressed in advanced stages, suggesting a potential role in tumor progression (McDonald2004Expression). These findings underscore the clinical significance of ST13 in various diseases, particularly its tumor suppressive properties and involvement in inflammatory pathways.

## Interactions
ST13, also known as the Hsp70 interacting protein (Hip), is involved in various protein interactions, primarily with the Hsp70 chaperone system. ST13 binds specifically to the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) of Hsp70 in the presence of ADP, stabilizing the ADP-bound state and preventing premature substrate release. This interaction is crucial for the chaperone cycle, as it enhances the conformational maturation of client proteins like the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (Li2013Structure).

ST13 competes with nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs) such as BAG1 for binding to Hsp70, thereby inhibiting ADP release and stabilizing Hsp70-client protein complexes (Li2013Structure). The TPR domain of ST13 is essential for its interaction with Hsp70, and mutations in this domain can impair binding (Li2013Structure).

ST13 also interacts with other chaperones, including Hsp90, and co-chaperones like Hop and Chip, forming complexes that play roles in protein folding and degradation (Li2013Structure). The interaction with Hsp90 is part of a cooperative mechanism linking Hsp70 with downstream chaperones (Li2013Structure). ST13's interactions are modulated by phosphorylation, which can affect its role in balancing protein folding and degradation pathways (Li2013Structure).
