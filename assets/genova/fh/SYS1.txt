# SYS1

## Overview
The SYS1 gene encodes the SYS1 Golgi trafficking protein, which plays a crucial role in the intracellular transport processes, particularly within the Golgi apparatus. This protein is involved in the regulation and maintenance of Golgi structure and function, facilitating the trafficking of proteins and lipids through the Golgi network. As a Golgi-associated protein, SYS1 is essential for the proper sorting and modification of proteins destined for various cellular locations. Dysregulation of SYS1 expression or function can have significant implications for cellular homeostasis and has been implicated in various pathological conditions, highlighting its importance in cellular biology and disease mechanisms (Qiu2020aarFDC).
