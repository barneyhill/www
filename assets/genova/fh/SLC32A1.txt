# SLC32A1

## Overview
The SLC32A1 gene encodes the protein known as solute carrier family 32 member 1, commonly referred to as the vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter (VIAAT) or vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT). This protein is a critical component of the central nervous system, functioning as a transmembrane transporter responsible for the uptake of inhibitory neurotransmitters, such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine, into synaptic vesicles. VIAAT plays a pivotal role in maintaining the balance of excitatory and inhibitory signals within the brain, which is essential for normal neuronal function and synaptic plasticity (Gasnier2004The; Platzer2021De). The gene is predominantly expressed in GABAergic and glycinergic neurons, as well as in peripheral tissues like the pituitary and pineal glands (Sundberg2008The). Mutations in SLC32A1 have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its significance in proper inhibitory neurotransmission (Platzer2021De).

## Function
The SLC32A1 gene encodes the vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter (VIAAT), also known as the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT). This protein is crucial for the uptake of inhibitory neurotransmitters, such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine, into synaptic vesicles in neurons. VIAAT functions by exchanging GABA or glycine for protons, a process driven by a vacuolar-type H+-ATPase that acidifies secretory vesicles, providing the necessary driving force for neurotransmitter uptake (Gasnier2004The; Li2020Effects).

In healthy human cells, VGAT is responsible for loading GABA into synaptic vesicles, which are then released into the synaptic cleft to inhibit neuronal activity. This process is essential for maintaining the balance of excitatory and inhibitory signals in the central nervous system, which is crucial for normal brain function (Platzer2021De; Nguyen2020A). The proper function of VGAT is vital for GABAergic neurotransmission, impacting synaptic strength and plasticity (Platzer2021De).

SLC32A1 is primarily expressed in the central nervous system, localizing to synaptic vesicles of GABAergic and glycinergic neurons, and is also found in peripheral tissues like the pituitary and pineal glands (Gasnier2004The). Its role in neurotransmitter uptake and release is essential for defining the inhibitory phenotype of neurons (Sundberg2008The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC32A1 gene, which encodes the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT), have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by epilepsy. De novo missense variants such as VGAT V263M, VGAT L269P, and VGAT F322C impair GABAergic neurotransmission by reducing the vesicular GABA content, leading to decreased amplitudes of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) and altered synaptic plasticity. These disruptions contribute to the pathophysiology of the associated neurodevelopmental disorder by impairing normal GABAergic signaling (Platzer2021De).

Patients with these SLC32A1 variants often exhibit moderate to severe intellectual disability, early-onset epilepsy, and movement disorders. The variants are located in critical regions of the VGAT transport domain, which may explain the severity of the phenotypic effects observed (Platzer2021De). The study of these variants highlights the importance of SLC32A1 in maintaining proper inhibitory neurotransmission and suggests that its disruption can lead to significant neurological impairments (Platzer2021De).

Additionally, altered expression of SLC32A1 has been observed in studies involving neuroblastoma cells, where a decrease in its expression was noted following treatment with certain compounds, indicating potential implications for GABAergic neurotransmission (Filatova2017GABA).

## Interactions
The SLC32A1 gene encodes the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT), which is crucial for loading the inhibitory neurotransmitters GABA and glycine into synaptic vesicles. VGAT is involved in interactions with proteins that are essential for synaptic vesicle cycling and neurotransmitter release. These interactions include those with synaptophysin and synaptobrevin, which facilitate inhibitory synaptic transmission by ensuring the proper loading and release of neurotransmitters at synapses (Platzer2021De).

The study of de novo missense variants in SLC32A1 has highlighted the impact of these interactions on GABAergic neurotransmission. Variants such as VGAT V263M, VGAT L269P, and VGAT F322C have been shown to impair synaptic vesicle filling and alter synaptic short-term plasticity, which are critical for maintaining effective inhibitory neurotransmission (Platzer2021De). These findings suggest that disruptions in VGAT's interactions with other synaptic proteins can lead to significant neurological consequences, including neurodevelopmental disorders and epilepsy (Platzer2021De). The study also hypothesizes that the p.(Ala91Thr) variant may disrupt protein-protein interactions or trafficking of VGAT, although it does not significantly affect inhibitory postsynaptic current amplitude or charge (Platzer2021De).
