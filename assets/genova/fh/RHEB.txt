# RHEB

## Overview
RHEB (Ras homolog enriched in brain) is a gene that encodes a small GTPase protein, which is a member of the Ras superfamily. The protein, known as Ras homolog, mTORC1 binding, plays a pivotal role in the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway, which is crucial for regulating cell growth, protein synthesis, and autophagy. RHEB is predominantly active on the lysosomal surface, where it interacts with mTORC1 to facilitate its activation. This interaction is essential for the regulation of cellular processes such as protein synthesis and cell cycle progression. The RHEB protein is characterized by a conserved GTPase domain and undergoes post-translational modifications, such as farnesylation, which are vital for its membrane localization and function. Dysregulation of RHEB, through mutations or altered expression, has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders, highlighting its significance in cellular signaling and disease pathogenesis (Potheraveedu2017Rheb; Xie2021TSCinsensitive; Yamagata1994rheb).

## Structure
The RHEB protein is a small GTPase related to the Ras family, playing a crucial role in the mTOR signaling pathway. Its primary structure consists of 184 amino acids, with a molecular mass of approximately 20,497 Da (Yamagata1994rheb). The protein contains a conserved GTPase domain, which is typical of Ras-related proteins, and includes consensus sequences for guanine nucleotide binding (Yamagata1994rheb).

In terms of secondary structure, RHEB exhibits a canonical fold typical of Ras-GTPases, with regions that form alpha helices and beta sheets (Schöpel2017The). The tertiary structure of RHEB, as determined by NMR spectroscopy, reveals dynamic behavior in the switch I and II regions, which are important for its function in GTP hydrolysis and interaction with regulatory proteins (Schöpel2017The).

RHEB undergoes post-translational modifications, including farnesylation at its C-terminal CAAX motif, which is essential for its membrane localization (Aspuria2004The; Yamagata1994rheb). This modification allows RHEB to associate with cellular membranes, a critical aspect of its role in signaling pathways (Záhonová2018Extensive). The protein does not typically form quaternary structures, functioning primarily as a monomer.

## Function
The RHEB gene encodes a small GTPase protein that plays a critical role in the mTORC1 signaling pathway, which is essential for regulating cell growth, protein synthesis, and autophagy in healthy human cells. RHEB is primarily active on the lysosomal surface, where it interacts with mTORC1 to promote its activation. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of protein synthesis and cell cycle progression, as RHEB activates mTORC1 by binding to it in its GTP-bound form (Tee2003Tuberous; Potheraveedu2017Rheb).

RHEB functions upstream of mTORC1 and is regulated by the TSC1/TSC2 complex, which acts as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for RHEB. This regulation is part of the insulin signaling pathway, where Akt phosphorylates TSC2, inhibiting the TSC1/TSC2 complex and allowing RHEB to accumulate in its active form, thereby activating mTORC1 (Aspuria2004The). RHEB's activity is also influenced by nutrient availability, as it can stimulate mTORC1 activity even during amino acid insufficiency, highlighting its role in nutrient signaling (Tee2003Tuberous).

In addition to its role in mTORC1 signaling, RHEB is involved in synaptic activity and neuronal signaling, particularly in the brain, where it is highly expressed. It is rapidly induced by synaptic stimuli and growth factors, suggesting a role in synaptic plasticity and neuronal growth (Yamagata1994rheb).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and dysregulation of the RHEB gene are implicated in several diseases, primarily through its role in the mTOR signaling pathway. In cancer, RHEB mutations such as T23M and E40K lead to constitutively active mTORC1 signaling, promoting oncogenic transformation and increased cell proliferation. These mutations are resistant to the inhibitory effects of the TSC1/2 complex, resulting in continuous mTORC1 activation, which is a hallmark of various cancers (Xie2021TSCinsensitive). Specific RHEB mutations, including Y35N, are found in endometrial and renal clear cell cancers, further highlighting the gene's role in cancer pathogenesis (Rahman2024Unraveling).

RHEB mutations are also associated with focal cortical dysplasia type II (FCDII), a condition linked to epilepsy. The RHEB p.Y35L mutation, for instance, results in aberrant mTOR pathway activation, leading to developmental brain malformations and seizures. Treatment with mTOR inhibitors like rapamycin has shown efficacy in alleviating these symptoms, underscoring the mutation's contribution to FCDII through mTOR pathway dysregulation (Zhao2019A).

In Alzheimer's disease, reduced Rheb levels correlate with increased BACE1 levels, suggesting a role in the disease's pathology through the regulation of protein degradation pathways (Shahani2014Rheb).

## Interactions
RHEB, a small GTPase, is involved in several critical protein interactions that regulate cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with BRAF, a component of the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway, inhibiting this pathway by preventing BRAF/CRAF heterodimerization. This interaction is dependent on RHEB's intact effector domain and GTP binding. Mutations in RHEB, such as T38A and D60I, reduce its interaction with BRAF, while the oncogenic mutant RHEB Y35N binds BRAF less effectively, leading to increased pathway activation (Heard2018An).

RHEB also interacts with Raf-1 kinase, a component of the H-Ras signaling pathway. This interaction is enhanced by growth factors and cAMP, and is dependent on GTP binding. RHEB's interaction with Raf-1 can synergize to transform growth properties in cells, indicating its role in modulating signaling pathways (Yee1997Rheb).

In the mTORC1 signaling pathway, RHEB binds to mTORC1, activating it to regulate cell growth and metabolism. HSP70, a novel binding partner of RHEB, can dissociate RHEB from mTORC1, inhibiting mTOR activation and reducing RHEB stability through proteasomal degradation (Ryu2020HSP70).
