# CLDN8

## Overview
The CLDN8 gene encodes claudin 8, a tetraspan transmembrane protein that is a member of the claudin family, which plays a critical role in the formation and function of tight junctions in epithelial cells. Claudin 8 is characterized by its four transmembrane domains and two extracellular loops, which are essential for its function in regulating paracellular ion permeability and maintaining epithelial barrier integrity (Meoli2020Channel; LalNag2009The). The protein is involved in various physiological processes, including chloride permeability in the kidney and ion selectivity in lung epithelia, and it interacts with other claudins to form complex tight junction networks (Kielgast2016Glucocorticoids; Hou2010Claudin4). Alterations in CLDN8 expression have been associated with several cancers, highlighting its potential role in tumor progression and as a prognostic marker (Cheng2019&lt; Zhou2019Identification).

## Structure
Claudin 8 (CLDN8) is a member of the claudin family, characterized by its structure as a tetraspan membrane protein. It consists of four transmembrane domains, with both the N- and C-terminus located in the cytoplasm (Meoli2020Channel; LalNag2009The). The protein features two extracellular loops, ECS1 and ECS2, which are crucial for its function in forming channels and influencing ion selectivity (Meoli2020Channel). The first extracellular loop (ECS1) contains a signature sequence important for the protein's function, and variations in this sequence can affect its ability to form channels and its ion selectivity (Meoli2020Channel).

Post-translational modifications of CLDN8 include ubiquitination, which is regulated by the Kelch-like 3 (KLHL3) gene. This modification is crucial for maintaining proper chloride permeability in the kidney's collecting duct, with ubiquitination occurring at the K213 lysine residue, a conserved site across mammalian species (Gong2015KLHL3). The interaction between CLDN8 and other claudins, such as claudin-4, is significant for its localization and function in tight junctions (Gong2015KLHL3). These structural features and modifications underscore CLDN8's role in regulating paracellular permeability and maintaining tight junction integrity.

## Function
Claudin 8 (CLDN8) is a crucial component of tight junctions (TJs) in epithelial cells, playing a significant role in regulating paracellular permeability and maintaining barrier integrity. In lung epithelia, CLDN8 is upregulated by glucocorticoids, such as dexamethasone and hydrocortisone, which enhances the barrier function by decreasing paracellular permeability and shifting ion permselectivity towards chloride ions (Kielgast2016Glucocorticoids). This regulation is mediated through a glucocorticoid receptor-dependent pathway, highlighting CLDN8's role in stabilizing the airway surface liquid and potentially benefiting conditions like asthma and COPD (Kielgast2016Glucocorticoids).

In the kidney, CLDN8 is essential for maintaining chloride permeability in the collecting duct. It interacts with claudin 4 to form a paracellular chloride channel, crucial for chloride reabsorption and maintaining extracellular fluid volume and blood pressure (Hou2010Claudin4). CLDN8 also plays a role in the gastrointestinal tract, where its expression increases from proximal to distal sections, contributing to the prevention of sodium backleak and maintaining epithelial resistance (Lameris2012Expression). Overall, CLDN8 is vital for the proper function and integrity of epithelial barriers in various tissues.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CLDN8 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In colorectal cancer (CRC), CLDN8 is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues. This overexpression promotes CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by activating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. Knockdown of CLDN8 in CRC cells results in reduced tumor growth and decreased expression of p-ERK, indicating its role in cancer progression (Cheng2019&lt; p&gt; CLDN8).

In colon cancer, CLDN8 is upregulated and contributes to tumor growth and metastasis. It is regulated by the lncRNA LINC00662, which interacts with miR-340-5p to modulate CLDN8 expression and activate the ERK signaling pathway. This interaction enhances cell proliferation and invasion while inhibiting apoptosis (Cheng2020LncRNA).

CLDN8 is also overexpressed in laryngeal squamous carcinoma, where it is associated with histological grade and Ki67 expression, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Zhou2019Identification).

Additionally, a missense mutation in CLDN8 has been linked to high plasma levels of interferon gamma-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) in methadone-maintained patients, indicating a possible role in inflammation (Liu2017Missense).

## Interactions
Claudin 8 (CLDN8) is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in tight junctions. CLDN8 forms strong heteromeric interactions with claudin 4 (CLDN4), as demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid assays and coimmunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293T cells. These interactions are essential for the proper localization of CLDN4 to tight junctions in kidney collecting duct cells, where CLDN8 recruits CLDN4 to form a paracellular chloride channel (Hou2010Claudin4). CLDN8 also interacts with other claudins, such as CLDN3 and CLDN7, indicating its role in forming complex tight junction networks (Hou2010Claudin4).

In addition to claudin interactions, CLDN8 interacts with tight junction protein zonula occludens (TJP-ZO), which is part of the junctional complex that maintains epithelial barrier integrity (Liu2016Systems). CLDN8 is also involved in interactions with CCDC155 and SYNE4, although the functional implications of these interactions are less well understood (Liu2016Systems).

CLDN8's expression can be regulated by miR-223, a microRNA delivered via mast cell-derived exosomes, which suppresses CLDN8 expression and affects intestinal barrier function (Li2020Mast).
