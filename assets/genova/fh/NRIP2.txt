# NRIP2

## Overview
NRIP2, or nuclear receptor interacting protein 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly through its interactions with other proteins. The NRIP2 protein is categorized as a nuclear receptor interacting protein, playing a pivotal role in modulating signaling pathways such as the Wnt pathway. This modulation is crucial in contexts like colorectal cancer and kidney disease, where NRIP2 influences the stability and activity of key proteins such as β-catenin and retinoic acid-related orphan receptor β (RORβ) (Hou2021Nuclear; Wen2017Upregulated). Through these interactions, NRIP2 contributes to the regulation of cellular proliferation, differentiation, and survival, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in disease contexts (Hou2021Nuclear; Wen2017Upregulated).

## Clinical Significance
NRIP2 has been implicated in the progression of colorectal cancer through its role in modulating the Wnt signaling pathway. In colorectal cancer initiating cells (CCICs), NRIP2 is significantly up-regulated, contributing to the self-renewal and maintenance of cancer stem cells. This up-regulation enhances Wnt pathway activity by preventing the transcription factor RORβ from binding to the promoter regions of HBP1, a Wnt pathway inhibitor, thereby reducing HBP1 transcription and promoting cancer cell proliferation (Wen2017Upregulated). The interaction between NRIP2 and RORβ is crucial, as it modulates the Wnt pathway, which is a critical event in colorectal cancer tumorigenesis (Wen2017Upregulated).

In the context of kidney disease, NRIP2 plays a significant role in podocyte injury by stabilizing and activating β-catenin, preventing its degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway. This stabilization leads to increased podocyte injury, proteinuria, and glomerulosclerosis. NRIP2 is upregulated in podocytes of patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), suggesting its involvement in the progression of kidney diseases (Hou2021Nuclear). These findings indicate that alterations in NRIP2 expression or its interactions can have significant implications for both cancer and kidney disease, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
NRIP2 (nuclear receptor interacting protein 2) is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In podocyte injury, NRIP2 interacts with β-catenin, stabilizing it and preventing its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This interaction is crucial for the activation of β-catenin, which is implicated in podocyte injury and proteinuria (Hou2021Nuclear). The binding between NRIP2 and β-catenin is mediated by the N-terminal domain of β-catenin, as demonstrated through immunoprecipitation assays (Hou2021Nuclear).

In colorectal cancer initiating cells, NRIP2 modulates the Wnt signaling pathway by interacting with retinoic acid-related orphan receptor β (RORβ). This interaction prevents RORβ from binding to the promoter regions of HBP1, a transcriptional inhibitor of the Wnt pathway, thereby enhancing Wnt activity and promoting the self-renewal of cancer-initiating cells (Wen2017Upregulated). Co-immunoprecipitation and western blot analyses have confirmed the binding of NRIP2 to RORβ, highlighting its role in the regulation of the Wnt pathway (Wen2017Upregulated). These interactions underscore NRIP2's involvement in critical cellular pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target.
