# AJAP1

## Overview
AJAP1, or adherens junctions associated protein 1, is a gene that encodes a type-I transmembrane protein involved in critical cellular processes, particularly those related to cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization. The AJAP1 protein is primarily associated with the cytoskeleton and plays a significant role in maintaining cell-cell adhesion by interacting with components of the E-cadherin-catenin complex. This interaction is vital for preserving the integrity of cell junctions, especially in epithelial tissues. AJAP1 is localized to the basolateral membrane of polarized epithelial cells, where it targets adherens junctions, crucial for cellular polarity and adhesion. Additionally, AJAP1 is implicated in modulating cell migration and invasion, acting as a negative regulator in these processes, which is particularly relevant in the context of angiogenesis and cancer metastasis. Its expression and function have been studied in various cancers, where it often acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting pathways that promote cell proliferation and metastasis (Hötte2017Endogenous; Xu2019βCatenin; TANAKA2015Adherens).

## Function
AJAP1, also known as adherens junctions associated protein 1, is a type-I transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in maintaining cell structure and function. In healthy human cells, AJAP1 is associated with the cytoskeleton and plays a crucial role in cell-cell adhesion by interacting with β-catenin in the E-cadherin-catenin complex. This interaction is essential for maintaining the integrity of cell-cell contacts, particularly in tissues such as the human mammary gland and uterus (Hötte2017Endogenous).

AJAP1 is active at the cell membrane, where it localizes to the basolateral membrane of polarized epithelial cells and targets adherens junctions. These junctions are critical for cell-cell adhesion and maintaining cellular polarity (TANAKA2015Adherens). In endothelial cells, AJAP1 associates with the microtubule cytoskeleton, forming fibrillar structures that co-localize with microtubules, but not with actin filaments. This association suggests a role in cytoskeletal organization and stabilization, which can influence cell migration and invasion (Hötte2017Endogenous).

AJAP1's involvement in modulating cell migration and invasion is evident in its function as a negative regulator of these processes, particularly during angiogenesis. Its presence is associated with reduced migratory behavior in endothelial cells, highlighting its role in maintaining cell and tissue integrity (Hötte2017Endogenous).

## Clinical Significance
AJAP1 (adherens junctions associated protein 1) is implicated in several cancers, including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and glioblastoma. In ESCC, AJAP1 expression is significantly reduced in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, and this downregulation is associated with poorer overall and disease-free survival rates, making it a potential prognostic marker for ESCC recurrence (TANAKA2015Adherens). The downregulation of AJAP1 in ESCC is linked to promoter hypermethylation, which suppresses its transcription (TANAKA2015Adherens).

In breast cancer, AJAP1 is downregulated, and its loss is associated with increased β-catenin activity, which promotes cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. AJAP1 acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting β-catenin nuclear translocation, and its depletion is linked to poor survival outcomes (Xu2019βCatenin).

In HCC, AJAP1 expression is reduced due to hypermethylation of its promoter, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor gene. This suppression is considered a specific event in the final stage of HCC initiation (Gentilini2017Epigenomewide). In glioblastoma, AJAP1 expression is drastically reduced, correlating with poorer survival, and its restoration decreases tumor cell proliferation and migration (Gentilini2017Epigenomewide).

## Interactions
AJAP1, also known as adherens junctions associated protein 1, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with β-catenin, a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway, and this interaction is crucial in regulating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). AJAP1 inhibits the nuclear translocation of β-catenin, thereby reducing its transcriptional activity and affecting downstream targets such as ZEB1, which is involved in EMT and metastasis (Han2024Retraction).

AJAP1 also forms a complex with E-cadherin and β-catenin at cell junctions, which is significant in maintaining cell adhesion and preventing metastasis in HCC (Han2024Retraction). In breast cancer, AJAP1 interacts with β-catenin to regulate its localization and transcriptional activity, affecting the expression of genes like C-myc and CyclinD1 (Xu2019βCatenin).

In glioblastoma, AJAP1 interacts with the E-cadherin-catenin complex and CD147, influencing cell invasion and migration (Han2014AJAP1). These interactions highlight AJAP1's role as a tumor suppressor across different cancer types by modulating key signaling pathways and cellular adhesion mechanisms.
