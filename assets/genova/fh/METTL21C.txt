# METTL21C

## Overview
The METTL21C gene encodes the protein methyltransferase 21C, AARS1 lysine, which is a member of the lysine methyltransferase family. This enzyme is involved in the post-translational modification of proteins, specifically through the methylation of lysine residues on non-histone proteins. METTL21C is characterized by its 7bS domain, a catalytic methyltransferase domain, and is part of the broader methyltransferase superfamily. The protein primarily localizes in the cytoplasm and plays a crucial role in muscle tissue by methylating alanine-tRNA synthetase 1 (AARS1) at lysine 943, a modification important for protein synthesis and muscle function (Yang2019GenomeWide; Zoabi2020Methyltransferaselike). Additionally, METTL21C is involved in various cellular processes, including the modulation of the NF-kB signaling pathway, and has been implicated in clinical conditions such as osteoporosis and obesity due to its influence on bone mineral density and body composition (Huang2014METTL21C; Zhao2016Association).

## Structure
The METTL21C protein is a lysine methyltransferase involved in post-translational modification, specifically methylating lysine residues on non-histone proteins. It is part of the methyltransferase superfamily and contains a 7bS (seven-beta strand) domain, which is a known catalytic methyltransferase domain (Zoabi2020Methyltransferaselike). The protein's structure includes conserved domains such as AdoMet_MTases, SAM_superfamily, and FAM86, which are involved in methylation reactions using S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) as a methyl donor (Yang2019GenomeWide).

The METTL21C protein has been shown to interact with specific residues, such as tryptophan 92 (Trp-92) and tyrosine 197 (Tyr-197), which form contacts with the cofactor SAM, essential for its methyltransferase activity (Zoabi2020Methyltransferaselike). The protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, where it methylates substrates like alanine-tRNA synthetase 1 (AARS1) at lysine 943 (Zoabi2020Methyltransferaselike).

The METTL21C gene family is evolutionarily conserved across species, including chickens, mice, and humans, indicating its structural and functional importance (Yang2019GenomeWide). The protein's molecular structure is characterized by these conserved domains, particularly the lysine methyltransferase domain, which is common across the gene family (Yang2019GenomeWide).

## Function
METTL21C is a methyltransferase-like protein that plays a significant role in the methylation of non-histone substrates, particularly in muscle tissue. It specifically methylates alanine tRNA synthetase 1 (AARS1) at lysine 943, a modification that occurs independently of ATP and tRNA molecules. This methylation is crucial for regulating protein synthesis in muscle tissue, suggesting that METTL21C is involved in muscle function and protein homeostasis (Zoabi2020Methyltransferaselike).

METTL21C is primarily expressed in skeletal muscle and is part of the METTL21 family, which includes other methyltransferases that target different substrates. The enzyme is active in the cytoplasm and does not methylate other proteins such as valosin-containing protein (VCP) or heat shock 70-kDa protein 8 (HSPA8), indicating a specific substrate preference (Zoabi2020Methyltransferaselike).

In addition to its role in muscle tissue, METTL21C is implicated in the modulation of the NF-kB signaling pathway, which is important for muscle differentiation and bone health. This suggests that METTL21C may have broader implications in musculoskeletal biology, potentially influencing conditions such as osteoporosis and sarcopenia (Huang2014METTL21C).

## Clinical Significance
The METTL21C gene, encoding a lysine methyltransferase, has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to its role in protein methylation. Alterations in METTL21C expression or mutations can impact cellular processes, potentially contributing to diseases such as osteoporosis and obesity. Studies have shown that specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes in the METTL21C gene are associated with variations in bone mineral density (BMD) and body composition, particularly in Chinese male nuclear families. These genetic variations may influence traits like lumbar spine BMD, femoral neck BMD, body mass index (BMI), and total fat mass (TFM), suggesting a genetic predisposition to osteoporosis and obesity (Zhao2016Association).

In addition to its role in bone and body composition, METTL21C has been studied for its effects on cell proliferation. Overexpression of METTL21C in chicken embryo fibroblasts (DF-1 cells) has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation by blocking the cell cycle in the G1/S phase. This inhibition is linked to the methylation of proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, such as cyclin E1 and cyclin D1, and may have implications for cancer research (Ke2023Phosphorylated). However, the specific clinical significance of these interactions and their implications for disease management require further investigation.

## Interactions
METTL21C is a lysine methyltransferase that participates in various protein interactions, primarily through its role in methylation. It has been shown to interact with the phosphorylated adapter RNA export protein (PHAX), mediating its trimethylation at lysine 381. This interaction is crucial for regulating cell proliferation, as the methylation of PHAX by METTL21C inhibits cell proliferation in chicken embryo fibroblast (DF-1) cells (Ke2023Phosphorylated). 

METTL21C also interacts with molecular chaperones, such as Hsp70 and Hsp90, which are involved in protein folding and stress responses. These interactions suggest a regulatory role for METTL21C in chaperone activity (Cloutier2013A). The protein is predominantly nuclear, indicating potential interactions within the nucleus, although no methylation of the four major histones has been observed (Cloutier2013A).

In addition to PHAX, METTL21C is involved in the methylation of other proteins, including nucleoside diphosphate kinases (NDPKs), eukaryotic transcription extension factor (eEF1A), and inversin (Invs), which are associated with cell proliferation and other cellular processes (Ke2023Phosphorylated). These interactions highlight METTL21C's role in regulating protein function through methylation.
