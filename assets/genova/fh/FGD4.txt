# FGD4

## Overview
FGD4 is a gene that encodes the protein FYVE, RhoGEF, and PH domain-containing 4, commonly referred to as Frabin. This protein is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling and cytoskeletal organization by specifically activating the CDC42 Rho GTPase. Frabin is characterized by its complex domain structure, which includes an F-actin binding domain, a Dbl homology (DH) domain, two pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, and a FYVE domain. These domains facilitate its interactions with actin filaments and phosphoinositides, contributing to its function in membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal reorganization. Frabin is particularly significant in Schwann cells, where it is involved in maintaining myelination and influencing cell shape changes. Mutations in the FGD4 gene are linked to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4H, highlighting its clinical importance in peripheral nerve function (Delague2007Mutations; Hyun2015Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth; Bossan2018Expression).

## Structure
The FGD4 protein, also known as Frabin, is characterized by a complex domain structure that facilitates its role in cellular signaling and cytoskeletal organization. It contains an N-terminal F-actin binding (FAB) domain, which allows it to interact with actin filaments, playing a crucial role in actin cytoskeleton reorganization (Liu2012EpsteinBarr). The protein also includes a Dbl homology (DH) domain, which serves as the principal guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) catalytic unit, specifically activating the CDC42 Rho GTPase by facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP (Bossan2018Expression; Liu2012EpsteinBarr).

Additionally, FGD4 features two pleckstrin homology (PH) domains and a FYVE domain. The FYVE domain is involved in membrane trafficking and phosphoinositide metabolism through its interaction with phosphoinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) (Bossan2018Expression). The PH domains are crucial for membrane targeting and interaction with other proteins, such as the Epstein-Barr virus-encoded LMP1, which enhances FGD4's activity towards CDC42, promoting cell migration (Liu2012EpsteinBarr).

FGD4's domain structure suggests its role as a cross-linker between membrane structures and the actin cytoskeleton, contributing to its function in maintaining myelination in Schwann cells and influencing cell shape changes (Hyun2015Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth; Bossan2018Expression). The protein's structure is critical for its involvement in various cellular processes, although specific details on its primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures are not provided in the available literature.

## Function
FGD4, also known as Frabin, is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) specific for the CDC42 Rho GTPase, playing a crucial role in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. It functions as a cross-linker between membrane structures and the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for maintaining the myelination of Schwann cells in healthy human cells (Bossan2018Expression). FGD4 contains several domains, including an FYVE domain, a Dbl homology (DH) domain, and two pleckstrin homology (PH) domains. The DH and PH1 domains are responsible for the activation of CDC42 through GTP exchange for GDP, while the FYVE and PH2 domains are involved in the indirect activation of Rac (Bossan2018Expression).

FGD4 is active in the cytoplasm and is implicated in Schwann cell function, affecting nerve myelination and repair. It is involved in Rho GTPase signaling, which plays a significant role in the myelination of peripheral axons. This is supported by observations in mouse models where FGD4 induces CDC42-mediated cell-shape changes in transfected Schwann cells (Hyun2015Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth). Loss of function mutations in FGD4 can lead to motor-sensory neuropathies or Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4 due to reduced CDC42 activity and subsequent demyelination of peripheral nerves (Bossan2018Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FGD4 gene are associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4H (CMT4H), an autosomal recessive demyelinating neuropathy. CMT4H is characterized by early onset, slow progression, muscle weakness, sensory loss, and foot deformities. The disease is caused by various mutations in the FGD4 gene, which encodes the protein frabin, a Rho GDP/GTP exchange factor involved in actin cytoskeleton regulation (Hyun2015Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth; Delague2007Mutations; Nishadham2024A).

Mutations such as p.Met298Thr and p.Met298Arg affect the Dbl homology (DH) domain of frabin, impairing its ability to activate Cdc42, a critical process for cellular functions like cytoskeleton organization (Delague2007Mutations). Other mutations, including c.1672C>T (p.Arg558Ter), lead to truncated proteins due to nonsense-mediated decay, resulting in a complete loss of protein function (Nishadham2024A). These genetic alterations disrupt normal frabin function, affecting myelination in Schwann cells and leading to the clinical manifestations of CMT4H (Nishadham2024A).

The clinical spectrum of CMT4H can vary, with some patients exhibiting mild phenotypes and late onset, while others experience more severe symptoms from an early age (ArgenteEscrig2019A; Nishadham2024A).

## Interactions
FGD4, also known as Frabin, is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that specifically interacts with the small GTPase Cdc42, playing a crucial role in actin cytoskeleton reorganization and cell motility. FGD4 interacts with the Epstein-Barr virus-encoded latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) through its PH1-to-PH2 domains, while LMP1 utilizes its transmembrane domains 3 and 4 for this interaction. This interaction leads to the activation of Cdc42, promoting actin rearrangement and increased cell motility, particularly in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells (Liu2012EpsteinBarr).

In prostate cancer, FGD4 interacts with Cdc42 and its downstream effector PAK, influencing cell migration and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This interaction is associated with changes in actin dynamics and cell motility, as well as drug sensitivity (Bossan2018Expression).

FGD4 also participates in the regulation of myelination in Schwann cells by interacting with phosphoinositides through its PH and FYVE domains. This interaction affects endocytic trafficking and the recycling of ErbB2 receptors, which is significant in the context of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4H (ElBazzal2022Imbalance).
