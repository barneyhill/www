# SCAMP1

## Overview
SCAMP1, or secretory carrier membrane protein 1, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in the regulation of vesicular transport and membrane trafficking within cells. The SCAMP1 protein is characterized by its four transmembrane segments and an extended cytoplasmic N-terminal domain, which facilitate its role in cellular processes such as exocytosis and endocytosis, particularly within the trans-Golgi network and endosomal compartments (Lin2005Secretory). The protein's structural features, including the conserved Asn-Pro-Phe (NPF) repeat, enable it to participate in protein interactions and membrane recycling, which are crucial for maintaining cell adhesion and communication (Lin2005Secretory). SCAMP1's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in various pathological conditions, including cancer, where its expression levels and interactions can influence tumor progression and patient prognosis (Vadakekolathu2018MTSS1; Ma2020Silencing).

## Structure
SCAMP1, or secretory carrier membrane protein 1, is characterized by a primary structure that includes multiple transmembrane segments. Specifically, SCAMP1 contains four transmembrane segments, which are a common feature among SCAMP family proteins (Lin2005Secretory). The protein also features an extended cytoplasmic N-terminal domain, which includes protein interaction motifs that may stabilize interactions with other proteins (Lin2005Secretory). A notable structural element within SCAMP1 is the Asn-Pro-Phe (NPF) repeat, a highly conserved region that includes a Pro-rich motif (Lin2005Secretory).

The secondary structure of SCAMP1 likely includes alpha-helices, typical of transmembrane proteins, although specific details on the secondary structure are not provided in the context. SCAMP1 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which could play a role in its function and interactions (Lin2005Secretory).

SCAMP1 can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may affect its function and localization within the cell (Lin2005Secretory). These structural features enable SCAMP1 to participate in various cellular processes, including membrane trafficking and protein interactions.

## Function
SCAMP1 (secretory carrier-associated membrane protein 1) is a crucial component in the regulation of vesicular transport and membrane trafficking within cells. It is primarily active in the trans-Golgi network and endosomal compartments, where it plays a significant role in exocytosis and endocytosis, processes essential for neurotransmitter release and membrane recycling (Vadakekolathu2018MTSS1). SCAMP1 is involved in post-Golgi recycling pathways and endosome cell membrane recycling, contributing to the intracellular trafficking of membrane vesicles. This function is vital for maintaining and regulating components of the plasma membrane, which is crucial for cell-cell adhesion (Vadakekolathu2018MTSS1).

In healthy cells, SCAMP1's role in vesicle trafficking and membrane recycling is essential for maintaining cell adhesion and preventing unwanted cell motility. This is important for cellular communication and homeostasis, as it ensures the proper functioning of cellular processes that rely on the dynamic movement and recycling of membrane components (Vadakekolathu2018MTSS1). SCAMP1's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining normal cellular function and structure.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SCAMP1 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SCAMP1 is upregulated, correlating with larger tumor size, advanced TNM stage, and poor prognosis. Silencing SCAMP1 in HCC cells inhibits proliferation and promotes apoptosis, suggesting its role as an oncogene through the activation of the p53 signaling pathway (Ma2020Silencing).

In ovarian cancer, SCAMP1 is highly expressed and promotes cell invasion and angiogenesis. It acts as a molecular sponge for miR-137, facilitating cancer progression through the SCAMP1/miR-137/CXCL12 axis (Song2020Long).

SCAMP1 is also overexpressed in glioma, where it is associated with higher pathological grades and poorer survival. Its knockdown reduces proliferation and migration while increasing apoptosis, indicating its oncogenic role via the SCAMP1/miR-499a-5p/LMX1A/NLRC5 pathway (Zong2019Knockdown).

In breast cancer, particularly HER2+/ER-/PR- subtypes, SCAMP1 interacts with MTSS1 to prevent cell migration and invasion. Loss of SCAMP1 is linked to increased tumor aggression and reduced survival, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for poor prognosis (Vadakekolathu2018MTSS1).

In osteosarcoma, SCAMP1 promotes cell viability and invasion by modulating the miR-26a-5p/ZEB2 axis, further supporting its role in cancer progression (Li2022LncRNA).

## Interactions
SCAMP1 (secretory carrier membrane protein 1) is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. In breast cancer, SCAMP1 interacts with MTSS1, a metastasis suppressor protein. This interaction is crucial for preventing cancer cell invasion and promoting cell-cell adhesion through RAC1-GTP activation, which enhances cell-cell contacts and reduces cell migration and invasion (Vadakekolathu2018MTSS1).

SCAMP1 also interacts with the organellar Na+/K+/H+ exchanger NHE7. This interaction is mediated by the cytoplasmic loop between the second and third transmembrane segments of SCAMP2, which binds to the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of NHE7. SCAMP1, along with SCAMP2 and SCAMP5, is involved in the trafficking of NHE7 between the trans-Golgi network and recycling vesicles, influencing its distribution and function in organellar pH homeostasis (Lin2005Secretory).

In breast cancer cells, SCAMP1-TV2, a transcript variant of SCAMP1, interacts with PUM2, a protein that regulates mRNA degradation. This interaction facilitates the degradation of INSM1 mRNA, affecting the malignant behavior of breast cancer cells (Tao2020Silencing).
