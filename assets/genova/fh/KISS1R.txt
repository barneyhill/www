# KISS1R

## Overview
The KISS1R gene encodes the KISS1 receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a critical role in the regulation of reproductive physiology. This receptor is primarily known for its involvement in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, where it mediates the effects of kisspeptin, a peptide that stimulates the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. The activation of KISS1R by kisspeptin is essential for the onset of puberty and the maintenance of reproductive function, as it triggers the secretion of key reproductive hormones such as luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) (Messager2005Kisspeptin; Trevisan2018KisspeptinGPR54). Beyond its reproductive roles, KISS1R is expressed in various tissues, suggesting additional physiological functions. Mutations in the KISS1R gene have been linked to reproductive disorders, including hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and precocious puberty, underscoring its importance in normal reproductive development and health (Skorupskaite2014The; Trevisan2018KisspeptinGPR54).

## Structure
The KISS1R gene encodes a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is integral to reproductive maturation. The KISS1R protein exhibits a typical GPCR structure, characterized by seven transmembrane domains, three extracellular loops, and three intracellular loops. The amino-terminus is extracellular, while the carboxyl-terminus is cytosolic (Bianco2013Molecular). The receptor primarily couples with the Gq/11 protein, and upon activation by its ligand, kisspeptin, it undergoes a conformational change that facilitates downstream signaling pathways (Bianco2013Molecular).

The molecular structure of KISS1R includes specific domains critical for its function. Mutations affecting these domains can lead to significant functional impairments. For instance, a deletion affecting the third intracellular loop and the sixth and seventh transmembrane domains results in a loss-of-function phenotype (Bianco2013Molecular). The receptor's structure is also influenced by post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, which are essential for its activity.

Mutations in KISS1R can lead to various reproductive disorders. For example, the Leu102Pro mutation in the first extracellular loop decreases membrane expression and impairs receptor signaling (Bianco2013Molecular). These structural insights are crucial for understanding the receptor's role in reproductive health.

## Function
The KISS1R gene encodes the KISS1 receptor, also known as GPR54, a G-protein-coupled receptor that plays a pivotal role in human reproductive health. This receptor is primarily involved in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, which is crucial for reproductive development and function. KISS1R is activated by its ligand, kisspeptin, leading to the stimulation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release from hypothalamic neurons. This activation triggers the secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the pituitary gland, essential for sexual steroid production and gamete formation in the gonads (Messager2005Kisspeptin; Trevisan2018KisspeptinGPR54).

KISS1R is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, placenta, and several peripheral organs, indicating its involvement in other physiological processes beyond reproduction (Trevisan2018KisspeptinGPR54). The receptor's activation involves phospholipase C, leading to the recruitment of secondary messengers like inositol triphosphate and diacylglycerol, which mediate calcium release and protein kinase C activation (Skorupskaite2014The). Mutations in KISS1R have been linked to reproductive disorders such as hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and precocious puberty, highlighting its critical role in normal pubertal progression and reproductive timing (Skorupskaite2014The; Trevisan2018KisspeptinGPR54).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KISS1R gene are associated with normosmic congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nCHH), a condition characterized by impaired sexual development due to insufficient secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) despite normal olfactory function. This condition can manifest as cryptorchidism and micropenis in males, and absent or subnormal breast development in females (Francou2016Prevalence; Moalla2019Nonstop). 

Several specific mutations in the KISS1R gene, such as A287E, R331*, C95W, P176R, Y103*, and C115W, have been identified as causing a loss of receptor function, leading to impaired membrane trafficking and receptor activity (Francou2016Prevalence). Other mutations, like the nonstop mutation p.X399R and the missense mutation p.Tyr313His, also result in a failure of GnRH secretion and pubertal maturation (Brioude2013Two; Moalla2019Nonstop).

The KISS1R gene is crucial for the activation of the gonadotropic axis during early development, and its mutations are typically transmitted in an autosomal-recessive manner (Francou2016Prevalence). Patients with these mutations generally respond to sex steroid replacement therapy and continuous exogenous administration of pulsatile GnRH (Moalla2019Nonstop).

## Interactions
The KISS1R protein, also known as GPR54, interacts with kisspeptins, which are peptide products of the KISS1 gene. This interaction activates several intracellular signaling pathways, including those involving G-proteins, leading to the activation of phospholipase C (PLC) and subsequent calcium mobilization (Castaño2009Intracellular; Kotani2001The). KISS1R can also engage in G protein-independent signaling through β-arrestin pathways, which are involved in the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) (Cvetković2013KisspeptinKISS1R).

KISS1R interacts with other receptors, such as the chemokine receptor CXCR4, where kisspeptin can inhibit CXCR4 signaling, potentially explaining its antimetastatic effects (Castaño2009Intracellular). In breast cancer cells, KISS1R can transactivate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) through β-arrestin 2 and IQGAP1-mediated pathways, contributing to cell migration and invasion (Cvetković2013KisspeptinKISS1R).

The receptor is also involved in the regulation of hormone release in the pituitary gland, influencing the secretion of hormones such as growth hormone and luteinizing hormone (Gahete2016Role). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of KISS1R in both reproductive and non-reproductive tissues.
