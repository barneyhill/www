# ANGPTL3

## Overview
The ANGPTL3 gene encodes angiopoietin-like protein 3, a secreted glycoprotein primarily involved in lipid metabolism. Located on chromosome 1 in humans, ANGPTL3 is expressed predominantly in the liver and plays a crucial role in regulating plasma lipid levels by inhibiting lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and endothelial lipase (EL), enzymes essential for triglyceride hydrolysis (Tikka2016The; Xu2018Role). The protein is characterized by a signal peptide, an N-terminal coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain, which is vital for receptor interactions (Chen2015Tissue; Biterova2018Structures). ANGPTL3's activity is significant for maintaining lipid and glucose homeostasis, and its deficiency due to loss-of-function mutations can lead to familial combined hypolipidemia, a condition marked by low plasma lipoprotein levels (Robciuc2013Angptl3). The gene's involvement in lipid metabolism and its impact on cardiovascular health make it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Tarugi2019Angiopoietinlike).

## Structure
The ANGPTL3 protein is a secreted glycoprotein involved in lipid metabolism, encoded by the ANGPTL3 gene located on chromosome 1 in humans. It consists of a signal peptide, an N-terminal coiled-coil domain, a linker region, and a C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain (Chen2015Tissue). The fibrinogen-like domain is crucial for interaction with receptors and is released by proteolysis (Biterova2018Structures). This domain is divided into three subdomains: A, B, and P. Subdomain A includes an α-helix and two β-strands forming a small antiparallel sheet, stabilized by a disulfide bond between Cys246 and Cys274. Subdomain B is the largest, with five β-strands forming a twisted antiparallel β-sheet and three α-helices. The P subdomain, involved in ligand binding, contains three short β-strands and a short α-helix, stabilized by a disulfide bond between Cys394 and Cys408 (Biterova2018Structures).

ANGPTL3 can form hexamers and trimers, with the trimeric form being more stable. These oligomeric states do not interconvert, and disulfide bonds do not contribute to oligomerization (Gunn2021Comparison). The protein is glycosylated, with N-linked glycans affecting its oligomeric state when produced in mammalian cells (Gunn2021Comparison). ANGPTL3 shares structural homology with angiopoietins but lacks a calcium-binding site (Biterova2018Structures).

## Function
ANGPTL3 (angiopoietin-like protein 3) is a secretory protein primarily expressed in the liver, playing a significant role in lipid metabolism. It functions as an inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and endothelial lipase (EL), enzymes crucial for the hydrolysis of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) such as very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and chylomicrons. By inhibiting LPL, ANGPTL3 modulates the breakdown of triglycerides, thereby influencing plasma triglyceride levels and the availability of free fatty acids for tissue uptake (Tikka2016The; Xu2018Role).

In healthy human cells, ANGPTL3 affects lipoprotein metabolism, which involves the transport and processing of dietary fats. It is involved in the regulation of plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) by inhibiting LPL and EL, respectively (Xu2018Role). ANGPTL3 also influences the secretion and composition of VLDL particles, shifting from triglyceride-rich VLDL1 to triglyceride-poor VLDL2 particles, which is associated with increased insulin sensitivity (Tikka2014Silencing).

ANGPTL3's activity is crucial for maintaining lipid and glucose homeostasis, impacting whole-body insulin sensitivity and glucose balance (Tikka2014Silencing). Its deficiency, due to loss-of-function mutations, leads to familial combined hypolipidemia, characterized by low levels of all major plasma lipoproteins (Robciuc2013Angptl3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ANGPTL3 gene are associated with several lipid metabolism disorders and cardiovascular conditions. Loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in ANGPTL3 lead to familial combined hypolipidemia (FHBL2), characterized by significantly reduced levels of plasma triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (Pisciotta2012Characterization; Tarugi2019Angiopoietinlike). These mutations result in increased lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity, enhancing the breakdown of TG-rich lipoproteins and reducing plasma lipid levels (Tarugi2019Angiopoietinlike).

Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ANGPTL3, such as rs12130333, are linked to type V Fredrickson hypercholesterolemia, while others like rs2131925 and rs12042319 are associated with variations in TG and LDL-C levels (Su2021ANGPLT3). In the Chinese Han population, the rs12563308 SNP is associated with a reduced risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) (Su2021ANGPLT3).

ANGPTL3 mutations also have implications for cardiovascular disease risk. LOF mutations are linked to a reduced risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and CAD due to lower circulating TG and LDL-C levels (Su2021ANGPLT3). Conversely, gain-of-function mutations can lead to elevated plasma TG levels, increasing cardiovascular risk (Lupo2018AngiopoietinLike). The gene's role in lipid metabolism makes it a target for therapeutic interventions aimed at reducing atherogenic lipoproteins (Tarugi2019Angiopoietinlike).

## Interactions
ANGPTL3 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in lipid metabolism and other biological processes. One of its primary interactions is with ANGPTL8, forming a complex that enhances ANGPTL3's ability to inhibit lipoprotein lipase (LPL). This interaction is crucial for the effective inhibition of LPL, as ANGPTL3 alone shows limited binding and inhibitory activity unless co-expressed with ANGPTL8. The ANGPTL3-ANGPTL8 complex is necessary for modulating plasma triglyceride levels, as it significantly enhances the inhibitory effect on LPL compared to either protein alone (Chi2017ANGPTL8; Jin2021The).

ANGPTL3 also interacts with integrin proteins, specifically ITGB3 and ITGAV, which are involved in cell adhesion and cancer metastasis. These interactions involve multiple residues forming hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and non-bonded interactions, highlighting ANGPTL3's role in angiogenesis and tumorigenesis (Iqbal2023An).

In addition to these interactions, ANGPTL3 enhances the cleavage of LPL by proprotein convertases such as furin and PACE4, which is essential for regulating LPL activity and plasma triglyceride levels. This process involves the N-terminal domain of ANGPTL3 and does not require ANGPTL3's own cleavage (Liu2010Angiopoietinlike).
