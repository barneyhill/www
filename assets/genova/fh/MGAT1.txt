# MGAT1

## Overview
MGAT1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme alpha-1,3-mannosyl-glycoprotein 2-beta-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, commonly referred to as N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GnT-I). This enzyme is a type II transmembrane glycosyltransferase that plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of N-glycans, which are essential for various cellular processes, including protein folding, stability, and cell signaling. Located in the medial Golgi apparatus, GnT-I catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine to mannose residues on glycoproteins, initiating the formation of complex and hybrid N-glycans (Schachter2010Mgat1dependent; Huang2015GnT1IPL). The activity of MGAT1 is crucial for normal cellular function and development, and its dysregulation has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer and autoimmune disorders (Akintayo2020Point; Li2019N‐acetylglucosaminyltransferase).

## Structure
The MGAT1 gene encodes the enzyme N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GnT-I), which is involved in the maturation of N-glycans. The enzyme is a type II transmembrane protein with a short N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane domain, and a large C-terminal catalytic domain responsible for its enzymatic activity (Nagae20203D). The catalytic domain of GnT-I features a GT-A fold, which includes an N-terminal core Rossmann fold and a C-terminal extension. This structure is crucial for its function as an inverting glycosyltransferase (Nagae20203D).

The enzyme's structure includes a flexible loop that becomes ordered upon binding with Mn2+ and UDP-GlcNAc, acting as a lid for the nucleotide sugar-binding site. The Mn2+ ion is coordinated in an octahedral geometry, interacting with the enzyme's DXD motif, which is essential for metal ion coordination (Nagae20203D; Unligil2000Xray). The enzyme operates through an ordered sequential 'Bi Bi' kinetic mechanism, binding Mn2+/UDP-GlcNAc first, followed by the Man5GlcNAc2 acceptor (Unligil2000Xray).

The enzyme's structure is shared with other glycosyltransferases, defining a new protein superfamily with a common evolutionary origin (Unligil2000Xray). The presence of a conserved DxD motif and specific residues like D291, which acts as a general base, are critical for its catalytic mechanism (Unligil2000Xray).

## Function
The MGAT1 gene encodes the enzyme UDP-GlcNAc:α3-d-mannoside β1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GnTI), which plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of N-glycans. This enzyme is responsible for catalyzing the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to mannose residues on glycoproteins within the medial Golgi apparatus, initiating the synthesis of complex and hybrid N-glycans (Schachter2010Mgat1dependent; Huang2015GnT1IPL). These N-glycans are essential for proper protein folding, stability, and function, impacting various cellular processes such as cell recognition, signaling, and immune response (Stanley2016What; Huang2015GnT1IPL).

In healthy human cells, MGAT1's activity is vital for the formation of complex N-glycans, which are necessary for normal development and cellular communication. The absence of MGAT1 leads to the expression of only oligomannosyl N-glycans, significantly altering cellular properties and affecting processes like growth factor signaling (Akintayo2020Point; Stanley2016What). The enzyme's function is also critical for the addition of other sugar residues, such as fucose and phosphorylcholine, to hybrid N-glycans, which are important for various biological functions (Schachter2010Mgat1dependent).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the MGAT1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In glioblastoma (GBM), MGAT1 is highly expressed, contributing to tumor cell proliferation and migration. This overexpression is linked to EGFR signaling, and its inhibition reduces MGAT1 levels, suggesting a potential therapeutic target in GBM (Li2019N‐acetylglucosaminyltransferase).

In multiple sclerosis (MS), specific MGAT1 gene variants, such as the MGAT1 IV A V T -T haplotype, affect N-glycan branching, which is crucial for T cell function. These genetic variations can modulate immune responses and are associated with MS pathogenesis (Mkhikian2011Genetics).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, MGAT1 expression is lower in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This reduced expression is associated with lower immune infiltration and impacts tumor progression and prognosis. Overexpression of MGAT1 in experimental settings has been shown to inhibit tumor cell proliferation and migration (Jiang2024Role).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), MGAT1 expression in macrophages within the tumor microenvironment influences tumor progression and patient prognosis. Altered MGAT1 interactions may affect immune responses and treatment outcomes, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2024Elucidating).

## Interactions
MGAT1 is involved in various protein interactions within the Golgi apparatus, forming multi-enzyme complexes essential for glycosylation processes. It interacts with other N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases such as MGAT2 and MGAT4B, forming specific sub-complexes that facilitate the synthesis of complex N-glycans. These interactions are crucial for the branching and processing of N-glycans in the medial-Golgi (KhoderAgha2019Nacetylglucosaminyltransferases).

MGAT1 also interacts with the nucleotide sugar transporters (NSTs) like SLC35A3, forming multi-enzyme/multi-transporter assemblies that enhance the efficiency and accuracy of glycan biosynthesis (KhoderAgha2019Nacetylglucosaminyltransferases). Additionally, MGAT1 forms heterodimers with other glycosyltransferases, such as β-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase II, which are important for the processing and maturation of N-glycans (Hassinen2010Golgi).

MGAT1 is specifically inhibited by GnT1IP-L in the Golgi apparatus. This inhibition is mediated through the luminal domain of GnT1IP-L, which forms heteromeric interactions with MGAT1, but not with other GlcNAc-transferases like MGAT2, MGAT3, MGAT4B, or MGAT5 (Huang2015GnT1IPL). These interactions highlight the specificity and regulatory mechanisms involving MGAT1 in glycoprotein synthesis.
