# TTC8

## Overview
TTC8 is a gene that encodes the protein tetratricopeptide repeat domain 8, also known as BBS8, which is a crucial component of the BBSome complex. This protein is characterized by the presence of tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which facilitate protein-protein interactions essential for its function in intracellular transport processes (Hartley2016Alternative). The BBSome complex, including TTC8, plays a vital role in ciliary membrane biogenesis and trafficking, which is critical for the proper functioning of cilia, hair-like structures on the cell surface involved in signaling and sensory functions (Downs2014A). Mutations in the TTC8 gene are associated with ciliopathies such as Bardet-Biedl syndrome and retinitis pigmentosa, highlighting its importance in maintaining ciliary function and photoreceptor health (Stoetzel2005BBS8; Hartley2016Alternative).

## Structure
The TTC8 protein, also known as BBS8, is characterized by the presence of tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which are crucial for protein-protein interactions. These motifs are located in the C-terminal half of the protein and form an extensive protein-binding domain (Hartley2016Alternative). The TTC8 protein is part of the BBSome complex, which functions primarily at the ciliary membrane and is involved in ciliogenesis (Downs2014A). 

The protein is composed of 14 exons, and alternative splicing results in different isoforms, including a retina-specific isoform (Downs2014A). In the canine retina, two isoforms of TTC8 are transcribed, with the normal retina-specific isoform encoding 515 amino acids and the ubiquitous isoform encoding 505 amino acids (Downs2014A). The TPR domains are essential for the protein's function, and mutations affecting these domains can lead to significant structural changes, such as the loss of TPR motifs, which are important for the protein's interaction capabilities (Downs2014A).

The TTC8 gene's alternative splicing, particularly involving exon 2a, is significant in the retina and pineal gland, affecting the open reading frames and the presence of TPR domains (Hartley2016Alternative).

## Function
The TTC8 gene encodes a protein that is a component of the BBSome complex, which is crucial for the assembly and function of cilia. Cilia are hair-like structures on the surface of cells that play a vital role in cellular signaling and sensory functions. The BBSome complex, including the TTC8 protein, is involved in ciliary membrane biogenesis and trafficking, facilitating the transport of proteins in and out of cilia (Hartley2016Alternative).

The TTC8 protein contains tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which form a protein-protein interaction domain essential for its function in intracellular transport processes. These domains enable TTC8 to interact with other proteins within the BBSome complex, contributing to its role in maintaining ciliary function (Hartley2016Alternative).

In healthy human cells, TTC8 is active in the outer segments of rod and cone photoreceptor cells, where it is involved in the transport of proteins necessary for photoreceptor function. This activity is critical for vision, as disruptions in TTC8 function can lead to retinal disorders such as retinitis pigmentosa and Bardet-Biedl syndrome (Hartley2016Alternative).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TTC8 gene, also known as BBS8, are associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a range of symptoms including retinal degeneration, obesity, polydactyly, cognitive impairment, and kidney abnormalities. BBS is a genetically heterogeneous condition, and mutations in TTC8 account for approximately 2% of BBS cases (Stoetzel2005BBS8; Murawska2024Case). The TTC8 gene encodes a protein that is part of the BBSome complex, which is crucial for ciliary function. Disruptions in this gene can impair cellular signaling pathways, contributing to the clinical manifestations of BBS (Mäkeläinen2020Deletion).

In addition to its role in BBS, mutations in TTC8 have been linked to autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a condition characterized by progressive retinal degeneration leading to vision loss (Downs2014A). In dogs, a deletion in the TTC8 gene results in a condition similar to BBS, with symptoms such as progressive retinal atrophy, obesity, and renal anomalies, suggesting that TTC8 mutations can lead to both syndromic and non-syndromic retinal degenerations (Mäkeläinen2020Deletion).

## Interactions
TTC8, also known as BBS8, is a component of the BBSome complex, which is crucial for ciliary protein trafficking. Within the BBSome, TTC8 interacts with several other BBS proteins, including BBS1, BBS2, BBS4, BBS5, BBS7, BBS9, and BBS18 (BBIP10) (Tian2023Organization; Nakayama2017Ciliary). TTC8 specifically interacts with BBS18, which serves as a linker between BBS4 and TTC8, facilitating the assembly of the BBSome complex (Katoh2015Architectures). 

The BBSome complex functions similarly to other coat protein complexes, such as COPI, COPII, and clathrin-adaptor complexes, in mediating the targeting of membrane proteins to cilia. ARL6/BBS3, a small GTPase, plays a role in the recruitment of the BBSome to membranes, akin to the function of ARF/SAR1 GTPases in other complexes (Nakayama2017Ciliary). 

TTC8's role in the BBSome is essential for the proper trafficking of proteins within cilia, and its interactions with other BBS proteins are critical for the stability and function of the complex. Disruptions in these interactions can lead to ciliopathies, such as Bardet-Biedl syndrome, characterized by defects in ciliary function (Mäkeläinen2020Deletion).
