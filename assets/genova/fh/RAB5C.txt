# RAB5C

## Overview
RAB5C is a gene that encodes a member of the RAS oncogene family, specifically a small GTPase protein involved in endocytic membrane trafficking. The RAB5C protein plays a pivotal role in the early stages of endosome biogenesis and is crucial for various cellular processes, including receptor recycling and signal transduction. It is predominantly expressed in endothelial cells, where it regulates the trafficking and recycling of key molecular complexes, such as the CD93/multimerin-2/β1 integrin complex, which are essential for cell adhesion and migration (Barbera2019The). Additionally, RAB5C is involved in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling by maintaining VEGFR2 levels on the cell surface, thus supporting angiogenesis and endothelial cell function (Kempers2021The). The protein's interactions with other molecules, such as AMAP1 and PRKD2, further underscore its role in cellular signaling and cancer invasion (Onodera2012Rab5c). Alterations in RAB5C expression have been linked to various diseases, including cancer, where it influences processes like radioresistance and angiogenesis (Baptistella2019Rab5C; Kempers2021The).

## Structure
RAB5C is a member of the RAS oncogene family and functions as a small GTPase involved in endocytic membrane trafficking. The protein typically consists of 215 amino acids and includes conserved GTP-binding motifs essential for its function. The primary structure of RAB5C features these motifs, which are crucial for GTP binding and hydrolysis (Kumar2020Structural).

The secondary structure of RAB5C is characterized by the presence of alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and function. The tertiary structure of RAB5C is defined by a compact GTPase fold, a common feature among proteins in this family, allowing it to interact effectively with other molecules and perform its role in intracellular trafficking (Kumar2020Structural).

Post-translational modifications of RAB5C include prenylation at the C-terminus. This modification is significant as it facilitates the attachment of the protein to cellular membranes, which is essential for its role in membrane trafficking processes (Kumar2020Structural).

While specific details about the quaternary structure of RAB5C are not provided, it is known to interact with effector proteins, which may influence its functional state and localization within the cell (Shahheydari2014Identification).

## Function
RAB5C is a small GTPase that plays a critical role in endocytic membrane trafficking, particularly in the early stages of endosome biogenesis. It is predominantly expressed in endothelial cells, such as human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), where it regulates the trafficking and recycling of the CD93/multimerin-2/β1 integrin complex. This process is essential for endothelial cell adhesion and migration, as RAB5C facilitates the delivery of these molecules to the cell surface, supporting cell movement and maintaining cell polarity (Barbera2019The).

RAB5C also plays a significant role in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling by preventing the lysosomal degradation of VEGFR2, thereby maintaining its levels on the cell surface. This function is crucial for VEGF-induced signaling pathways, including AKT and ERK-1/2 phosphorylation, which are vital for angiogenesis and endothelial cell function (Kempers2021The). The protein is active in the cytoplasm, particularly associated with endosomal membranes, where it influences cellular processes such as receptor recycling and signal transduction, impacting cell motility and angiogenesis (Kempers2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RAB5C gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In rectal cancer, RAB5C is associated with enhanced resistance to ionizing radiation (IR). The gene modulates the internalization and trafficking of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is crucial for DNA repair and cell survival following IR. Increased expression of RAB5C, along with DNA repair proteins Ku70 and Ku80, is linked to radioresistance in rectal cancer cells. Knockdown of RAB5C results in delayed EGFR internalization and decreased resistance to IR, suggesting its significant role in regulating DNA repair proteins and IR resistance (Baptistella2019Rab5C).

RAB5C also plays a role in angiogenesis by regulating VEGFR2 signaling. It prevents VEGFR2 degradation, maintaining its levels on the cell surface, which is essential for endothelial cell sprouting and angiogenesis. Depletion of RAB5C leads to increased degradation of VEGFR2, reduced VEGF signaling, and impaired endothelial cell sprouting, highlighting its critical role in vascular development (Kempers2021The).

In hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) development, RAB5C is crucial for endocytic trafficking and Notch signaling. Deficiency in RAB5C impairs HSPC specification, affecting the development of various blood cell lineages (Heng2020Rab5cmediated).

## Interactions
Rab5C, a member of the RAS oncogene family, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in endocytic trafficking and cellular signaling. Rab5C interacts with AMAP1 and PRKD2 to form a complex that enhances β1 integrin recycling, which is essential for EGF-induced cancer invasion. This interaction is facilitated by the activation of Rab5C through EGFR signaling, promoting the intracellular association of AMAP1 with PRKD2 (Onodera2012Rab5c).

Rab5C also interacts with TBC1D16, a GTPase-activating protein, to inhibit prototype foamy virus replication. This interaction is necessary for the maximal inhibition of viral replication, as both Rab5C and TBC1D16 can independently reduce PFV replication, but their interaction enhances this effect (Yan2021Novel).

In endothelial cells, Rab5C regulates the trafficking of the CD93/MMRN2/β1 integrin complex, which is important for cell adhesion and migration. Silencing Rab5C impairs the recycling of CD93 and reduces the surface expression of β1 integrin, affecting cell migration processes (Barbera2019The).

Rab5C has also been identified as a novel binding partner of TPD52, a protein overexpressed in various cancers. This interaction was confirmed through yeast two-hybrid screening and pull-down assays, suggesting a potential role in TPD52's oncogenic functions (Shahheydari2014Identification).
