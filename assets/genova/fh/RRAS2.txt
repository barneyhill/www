# RRAS2

## Overview
RRAS2 is a gene that encodes the RAS-related protein 2, a member of the RAS superfamily of small GTPases. This protein functions as a molecular switch in various cellular signaling pathways, playing a pivotal role in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. As a small GTPase, RAS-related protein 2 is involved in the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway, which is crucial for numerous cellular processes, including growth and development (Iida2024Functional). The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications such as isoprenylation and phosphorylation, which influence its membrane localization and activation state (Nakhaei-Rad2018Structural). RRAS2 is implicated in several physiological processes, including immune system function and nervous system development, and its dysregulation is associated with various pathologies, including RASopathies and cancer (Hortal2022Overexpression; Weber2021The).

## Structure
RRAS2, also known as TC21, is a member of the RAS superfamily of small GTPases. The primary structure of RRAS2 includes a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, which is involved in cell signaling. The protein contains GTP-binding domains, which are crucial for its function as a molecular switch between active and inactive states (Nakhaei-Rad2018Structural). 

Post-translational modifications play a significant role in the function of RRAS2. Isoprenylation, specifically the attachment of a farnesyl or geranylgeranyl moiety to the cysteine residue of the CAAX motif, is essential for its membrane association (Nakhaei-Rad2018Structural). This modification is common among RAS family proteins and aids in their localization to cellular membranes. 

RRAS2 is also subject to phosphorylation by ERK1/2, which affects its activation state but not its subcellular localization (Nakhaei-Rad2018Structural). The protein's role in signaling pathways, such as the activation of the ERK and PI3K-AKT pathways, is influenced by these modifications (Clavaín2022Characterization). 

While specific details about the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of RRAS2 are not provided, the protein's interactions and modifications suggest a complex regulatory role in cellular signaling networks. Splice variant isoforms may exist, potentially altering its function and interactions (Nakhaei-Rad2018Structural).

## Function
The RRAS2 gene encodes a protein that is a member of the RAS superfamily of small GTPases, which are involved in transmitting signals within cells. In healthy human cells, RRAS2 plays a crucial role in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival through its involvement in the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway (Iida2024Functional). This pathway is essential for controlling various cellular processes, including growth and development.

RRAS2 is active in the plasma membrane, where it functions as a signal transducer. It is involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and migration, particularly through the activation of the PI3K signaling pathway, which is important for neurite formation and differentiation in neuronal cells (Weber2021The). In the immune system, RRAS2 supports the survival and maintenance of mature T cells by transmitting low-grade signaling through T-cell receptors, which is critical for T-cell receptor activation and internalization (Weber2021The).

In the nervous system, RRAS2 is necessary for oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination, processes essential for proper nerve function (Weber2021The). The protein's activity in these pathways highlights its importance in maintaining normal immune responses and nervous system development and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the RRAS2 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly those involving the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway. RRAS2 mutations are associated with Noonan Syndrome (NS) and Noonan-like phenotypes, which are part of a group of disorders known as RASopathies. These conditions are characterized by distinctive facial features, cardiovascular abnormalities, and developmental delays. Specific RRAS2 mutations, such as p.Gly23Val and p.Gly24Glu, have been shown to cause hyperactivity in the RAS signaling pathway, leading to developmental issues and increased risk of tumors (Iida2024Functional; Niihori2019GermlineActivating).

In addition to its role in developmental disorders, RRAS2 is implicated in oncogenesis. Overexpression of RRAS2, even without oncogenic mutations, has been linked to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), where it is necessary for the activation of B-cell receptor signaling pathways crucial for leukemic cell proliferation (Hortal2022Overexpression). RRAS2 overexpression is also associated with post-partum-associated triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), where it contributes to tumor development by altering signaling pathways and promoting cell proliferation (Cifuentes2024Unmutated). These findings highlight the significant role of RRAS2 in both genetic syndromes and cancer.

## Interactions
RRAS2, also known as TC21, is a member of the RAS superfamily of small GTPases and is involved in various cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with several key proteins, including members of the RAF kinase family, PI3K, and RalGDS, which are crucial for its role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival (Clavaín2022Characterization). The Q72L mutation in RRAS2, analogous to the Gln 61 mutation in classical RAS proteins, impairs GTP hydrolysis, keeping the GTPase in an active state and contributing to oncogenic activity by maintaining PI3K and ERK activities (Clavaín2022Characterization).

RRAS2 also interacts with effectors such as RAF1 (CRAF) and RASSF5. The p.Ala70Thr mutation in RRAS2 leads to a structural rearrangement that affects its interaction with these effectors, maintaining a similar interaction with CRAF but abolishing binding to RASSF5 (Capri2019Activating). This mutation results in increased ERK phosphorylation, indicating enhanced MAPK signaling, although it does not significantly alter AKT phosphorylation (Capri2019Activating).

In the context of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), RRAS2 is involved in the activation of the RhoA/ROCK1/MYPT1 signaling cascade, which is crucial for cell migration and proliferation (Weber2021RRas). The protein's interactions with these signaling pathways highlight its significant role in tumorigenic processes.
