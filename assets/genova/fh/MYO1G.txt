# MYO1G

## Overview
MYO1G is a gene that encodes the protein myosin IG, a member of the class I myosins, which are non-filamentous motor proteins involved in various cellular processes. Myosin IG is characterized by its ability to bind actin and ATP through its N-terminal catalytic motor domain, facilitating its role in cellular motility and membrane dynamics (PatinoLopez2010Myosin; López‐Ortega2016Myo1g). The protein is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells, such as B and T lymphocytes, where it plays a critical role in processes like phagocytosis, membrane trafficking, and cell signaling (Maravillas‐Montero2014Myosin; Chung2019Roles). Myosin IG's interaction with phosphoinositides and its localization to the plasma membrane are mediated by its C-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH)-like domain, which is essential for its function in immune cell activities (PatinoLopez2010Myosin; López‐Ortega2016Myo1g). The gene's expression and regulation have clinical implications, particularly in hematological malignancies, where alterations in MYO1G expression have been associated with conditions such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (AraujoCárdenas2023Myosin).

## Structure
MYO1G (myosin IG) is a class I myosin protein characterized by a distinct molecular structure comprising several key domains. The protein includes an N-terminal catalytic motor domain, which binds to actin and ATP, facilitating its role as a motor protein (PatinoLopez2010Myosin; López‐Ortega2016Myo1g). The neck region contains IQ motifs that bind calmodulin, a regulatory light chain, which is typical of myosin proteins (López‐Ortega2016Myo1g; Maravillas‐Montero2014Myosin).

The C-terminal tail domain of MYO1G is crucial for its membrane association and includes a pleckstrin homology (PH)-like domain. This domain is essential for binding to membrane phosphoinositides, such as phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate, which are important for its localization to the plasma membrane (PatinoLopez2010Myosin; López‐Ortega2016Myo1g). The PH-like domain is part of a superfamily known for lipid binding, and in MYO1G, it is divergent from other PH domains, with unique sequence characteristics (PatinoLopez2010Myosin).

MYO1G is a monomeric protein, meaning it does not form filaments like some other myosins. It is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells, where it plays roles in cellular processes such as phagocytosis and membrane trafficking (Maravillas‐Montero2014Myosin; Chung2019Roles). The protein's structure and function are influenced by its specific domain composition and interactions with cellular membranes.

## Function
MYO1G (myosin IG) is a class I myosin protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, particularly in immune cells. It is primarily localized at the plasma membrane and is involved in linking actin filaments to the membrane, which is essential for maintaining cell shape and motility (PatinoLopez2010Myosin). MYO1G is abundant in lymphocytes and is associated with membrane compartments such as lipid rafts and microvilli, contributing to processes like cell spreading, migration, and cytoskeleton rearrangements (Maravillas‐Montero2014Myosin; Santos‐Argumedo2013Class).

In B lymphocytes, MYO1G is involved in the recycling of the CD44 adhesion protein, which is critical for cell adhesion and migration. It affects the recruitment of GTPases like RhoA and CDC42 to lipid rafts, influencing cell signaling and membrane dynamics (LópezOrtega2017Myosin). MYO1G also plays a role in maintaining membrane tension and cell elasticity, which are vital for proper cell function and immune response (Olety2009Myosin; López‐Ortega2016Myo1g).

MYO1G's interaction with phosphoinositides and actin filaments facilitates its role in phagocytosis, where it contributes to the contractile forces necessary for phagosome closure (Dart2012The). Its presence in lipid rafts suggests a role in vesicular transport and signaling complex formation, crucial for B cell activation and differentiation (Santos‐Argumedo2013Class).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MYO1G gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions, particularly in the context of hematological malignancies. MYO1G is expressed predominantly in hematopoietic cells, including B and T lymphocytes, and its overexpression has been associated with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In a case study, a pediatric patient with ALL exhibited significant overexpression of MYO1G at diagnosis and during relapse, suggesting its potential role as a biomarker for high risk and early relapse in leukemia. This overexpression could aid in classifying patients from low to high risk at diagnosis, allowing for more tailored treatment strategies (AraujoCárdenas2023Myosin).

The study also highlighted a rare lineage switch from ALL to a myeloid phenotype, which is more common in pediatric patients and poses challenges in treatment and prognosis. Monitoring MYO1G expression could be valuable in clinical practice for assessing relapse risk and guiding treatment decisions (AraujoCárdenas2023Myosin). Despite these findings, the clinical significance of MYO1G gene mutations and their association with other diseases has not been extensively documented, and further research is needed to fully understand its role in disease pathogenesis (PatinoLopez2010Myosin).

## Interactions
MYO1G, a class I myosin, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. In B lymphocytes, MYO1G interacts with the adhesion protein CD44, playing a significant role in its mobilization and recycling. This interaction is evidenced by MYO1G's co-immunoprecipitation with CD44, indicating a direct physical association (LópezOrtega2017Myosin). MYO1G also associates with lipid rafts, which are essential for CD44 mobilization and capping, as demonstrated by its co-localization with caveolin and GM1 in these microdomains (LópezOrtega2017Myosin).

In the context of phagocytosis, MYO1G interacts with phosphoinositides, particularly PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3, through a pleckstrin homology (PH)-like domain. This interaction is crucial for MYO1G's localization at phagocytic sites and is dependent on PI3K activity (Dart2012The). Mutations in MYO1G that disrupt its ability to bind these phosphoinositides impair its function in phagocytosis (Dart2012The).

MYO1G also interacts with cytosolic proteins such as the GTPase RalA and srGAP2, which are involved in exocytosis and cell migration, suggesting its role in assembling molecular complexes necessary for efficient recycling and trafficking of CD44 (LópezOrtega2017Myosin).
