# TXNL4A

## Overview
TXNL4A is a gene that encodes the protein thioredoxin-like 4A, which is a crucial component of the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex within the spliceosome. The spliceosome is responsible for the precise removal of introns and the joining of exons in pre-mRNA, a critical step in the maturation of mRNA and subsequent gene expression (Wood2021The; Wood2020Modelling). Thioredoxin-like 4A is highly conserved and plays a pivotal role in maintaining the proper assembly and function of the spliceosome, ensuring accurate splicing and preventing premature activation (Wood2021The). The protein is active in the nucleus and is essential for the splicing of all pre-mRNAs, impacting cellular homeostasis and development (Wood2020Modelling; Liu2006The). TXNL4A's involvement in the spliceosome underscores its importance in regulating alternatively spliced transcript isoforms, which are vital for human cell biology and development (Wood2020Modelling).

## Function
The TXNL4A gene encodes a protein that is a core component of the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP), which is part of the spliceosome complex responsible for pre-mRNA splicing. This process is crucial for the removal of introns and the joining of exons to form mature mRNA, a key step in gene expression (Wood2021The; Wood2020Modelling). The protein encoded by TXNL4A is highly conserved and plays a significant role in maintaining the proper assembly and function of the spliceosome, particularly by preventing premature activation of the spliceosome and ensuring accurate splicing (Wood2021The).

In healthy human cells, TXNL4A is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the assembly of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP, a critical component of the spliceosome (Liu2006The). The protein's function is essential for the splicing of all pre-mRNAs, impacting cellular homeostasis and proper gene expression, which are vital for normal cellular functions and organismal development (Wood2020Modelling). The role of TXNL4A in the spliceosome highlights its importance in maintaining the balance of alternatively spliced transcript isoforms, which are critical for human cell biology and development (Wood2020Modelling).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the TXNL4A gene have significant clinical implications. TXNL4A is associated with Burn-McKeown Syndrome (BMKS), a rare genetic disorder characterized by craniofacial anomalies, choanal atresia, and other features. BMKS is caused by biallelic variants in TXNL4A, often involving a 34 bp deletion in the promoter region of one allele combined with a loss-of-function variant on the other allele. This results in reduced gene expression, which is believed to cause the disorder (Wood2021The; Cody2018Chromosome).

In the context of cancer, TXNL4A has been identified as a biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). High expression levels of TXNL4A are associated with worse overall survival and progression-free intervals in HCC patients. It is also linked to increased docetaxel tolerance, tumor invasion, and dysregulation of several pathways. TXNL4A expression correlates with immune cell infiltration, suggesting a role in the tumor microenvironment (Li2023Combined).

These findings highlight the importance of TXNL4A in both genetic disorders and cancer, indicating its potential as a target for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

## Interactions
TXNL4A, also known as thioredoxin-like 4A, is a core protein component of the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex, which is essential for pre-mRNA splicing. It interacts with several proteins within the spliceosome, including PRPF8 and EFTUD2, and is connected to the U5 snRNA loop I. These interactions are crucial for the proper assembly and function of the spliceosome, particularly in the context of the U5 snRNP complex (Wood2021The; Klimešová2021TSSC4).

TXNL4A is also involved in interactions with PRPF6, which may prevent its premature exit from the spliceosome, ensuring the correct timing of spliceosome assembly and activation (Wood2021The). In the context of Burn-McKeown Syndrome (BMKS), variants in TXNL4A can disrupt these interactions, leading to defective splicing and differentiation, particularly affecting genes involved in craniofacial development (Wood2021The).

In addition to its role in the spliceosome, TXNL4A is associated with the nuclear membrane and the SMN-Sm protein complex, indicating its involvement in broader nucleic acid processing pathways (Yao2021Identification). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of TXNL4A in cellular processes related to RNA splicing and gene expression.
