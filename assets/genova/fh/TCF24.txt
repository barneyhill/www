# TCF24

## Overview
TCF24 is a gene that encodes the transcription factor 24 protein, which is involved in the regulation of gene expression. As a transcription factor, TCF24 plays a crucial role in modulating the transcriptional activity of specific target genes, thereby influencing various biological processes. The protein is characterized by its ability to bind to DNA and regulate the transcription of genes involved in cellular differentiation and development. Although the precise mechanisms and pathways involving TCF24 are still under investigation, it is known to interact with other proteins and factors to exert its regulatory functions. Understanding the role of TCF24 in cellular processes is essential for elucidating its potential implications in health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
