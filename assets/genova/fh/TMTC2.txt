# TMTC2

## Overview
TMTC2 is a gene that encodes the protein transmembrane O-mannosyltransferase targeting cadherins 2, which is integral to the process of O-mannosylation, a type of glycosylation critical for protein function and stability. This protein is categorized as a glycosyltransferase and is characterized by its multiple transmembrane domains and a C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Larsen2019Multiple; Eisenhaber2021Conserved). TMTC2 plays a pivotal role in the ER, contributing to intracellular calcium homeostasis and the proper folding of glycoproteins, particularly cadherins, which are essential for cell adhesion and tissue integrity (Eisenhaber2021Conserved). The protein's enzymatic activity involves the transfer of mannose residues, a process that is crucial for maintaining the structural and functional integrity of proteins (Eisenhaber2021Conserved).

## Structure
TMTC2 is a protein characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes multiple transmembrane domains and specific sequence motifs. The protein's N-terminal segment contains 11 transmembrane regions, with the N-terminus located in the cytoplasm and the C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain situated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen (Eisenhaber2021Conserved). The TPR domain is known for mediating protein-protein interactions, which may play a role in substrate recruitment (Larsen2019Multiple).

TMTC2 shares structural homology with glycosyltransferases, particularly those in the GT-C clan, and is involved in O-mannosylation processes. It contains conserved sequence motifs that are rationalized as ligand-binding sites, crucial for its enzymatic function (Eisenhaber2021Conserved). The protein's structure includes a GT-C fold, which is common among glycosyltransferases and is composed of multiple transmembrane helical domains (Taujale2021Mapping).

Post-translational modifications of TMTC2 may include glycosylation, which is consistent with its role in glycosylation processes (Larsen2019Multiple). The protein also contains a DUF1736 sequence segment, which is part of the ArnT superfamily domains (Eisenhaber2021Conserved).

## Function
TMTC2 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the O-mannosylation of cadherins, which are essential for cell-cell adhesion and maintaining tissue integrity. This protein is part of a new O-mannosylation pathway and is suspected to have mannosyl-transferase activity, specifically targeting cadherin-like substrates (Eisenhaber2021Conserved). TMTC2 is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it plays a crucial role in intracellular calcium homeostasis and the proper folding and function of glycoproteins (Eisenhaber2021Conserved).

The TMTC2 protein is characterized by a conserved sequence architecture, including an N-terminal segment with transmembrane regions and a C-terminal stretch of tetratricopeptide (TPR) repeats, which are important for its function in the ER (Eisenhaber2021Conserved). The protein's enzymatic activity involves transferring mannose residues to proteins, a process critical for protein folding and stability (Eisenhaber2021Conserved). This function is facilitated by conserved sequence motifs that serve as ligand binding sites, interacting with dolichyl-phosphate-mannose (DPM) and divalent metal ions, which are essential for the protein's catalytic activity (Eisenhaber2021Conserved).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TMTC2 gene have been linked to a variety of clinical conditions. TMTC2 is associated with non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), a condition characterized by the loss of hearing due to damage to the inner ear or the nerve pathways from the inner ear to the brain (Eisenhaber2021Conserved). Additionally, interactions between TMTC2 and certain microRNAs suggest a potential role in Parkinson's disease, indicating that changes in TMTC2 expression or function could contribute to neurodegenerative processes (Eisenhaber2021Conserved).

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have also linked TMTC2 to obesity in specific populations, such as Caribbean Hispanics and Han Chinese, as well as to an increase in left ventricular mass and immune-related conditions like eczema, asthma, and the 'atopic march' (Eisenhaber2021Conserved). Furthermore, a novel TMTC2-NTRK3 fusion has been identified in a case of undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS), a rare and aggressive form of cancer. This fusion was responsive to treatment with Larotrectinib, highlighting the potential for targeted therapies in cancers involving TMTC2 alterations (Bai2021The). These findings underscore the gene's pleiotropic effects and its significance in various disease contexts.
