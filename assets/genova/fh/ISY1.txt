# ISY1

## Overview
ISY1 is a gene that encodes the ISY1 splicing factor homolog, a protein involved in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing and DNA repair processes. The ISY1 protein is a component of the NineTeen Complex (NTC), which is essential for spliceosome activation and splicing fidelity. It interacts with various splicing factors and small nuclear RNAs, playing a critical role in the assembly and function of the spliceosome (BenYehuda2000Genetic; DIX1999The). Additionally, ISY1 is implicated in the base excision repair (BER) pathway, where it enhances the activity of apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1), thereby contributing to the repair of oxidative and alkylating DNA damage (Jaiswal2020The). This dual functionality underscores its importance in maintaining genomic stability and cellular homeostasis.

## Function
ISY1 is a splicing factor that plays a significant role in the base excision repair (BER) pathway, a critical process for maintaining genomic stability in healthy human cells. It interacts with apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1), enhancing its binding to abasic DNA sites and boosting its endonuclease activity. This interaction is crucial for repairing oxidative and alkylating DNA base lesions, particularly in environments where APE1 levels are low, such as during oxidative stress or in aging tissues (Jaiswal2020The). ISY1 specifically enhances the 5'-3' endonuclease activity of APE1, facilitating both short-patch and long-patch BER pathways, which are essential for the repair of oxidized or mono-alkylated DNA (Jaiswal2020The).

ISY1 is also involved in cellular resistance to DNA damage caused by alkylating agents and oxidative stressors. Its depletion results in reduced cell survival under these conditions, highlighting its role in normal cell function and DNA repair (Jaiswal2020The). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing, linking DNA damage repair with splicing mechanisms (Jaiswal2020The). This dual role underscores ISY1's importance in maintaining genomic integrity and cellular homeostasis.

## Interactions
The ISY1 splicing factor homolog is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in pre-mRNA splicing. ISY1 is a component of the NineTeen Complex (NTC), which is essential for spliceosome activation. It interacts with several splicing factors, including Syf1p, Syf3p, and Cef1p, forming part of a multiprotein complex that associates with spliceosomes (BenYehuda2000Genetic; DIX1999The). ISY1 also interacts with U5 and U6 snRNAs, suggesting its involvement in a di-snRNP complex, U5+U6, which may result from spliceosome turnover or tri-snRNP dissociation (DIX1999The).

ISY1's interaction with the ATPase Prp16p is significant for regulating splicing fidelity. It is proposed to favor the NTC-dependent stable association of U6 with the spliceosome, and its deletion can suppress certain splicing defects, indicating a role in modulating spliceosomal conformation (Villa2005The). The interactions between ISY1 and U6 snRNA are crucial for the first-step catalysis of splicing, and ISY1 is involved in the regulation of splicing fidelity during the Prp16p-dependent transition toward the second step of splicing (Villa2005The).
