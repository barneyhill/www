# LIN7A

## Overview
LIN7A is a gene that encodes the protein lin-7 homolog A, a crucial component of the crumbs cell polarity complex. This protein is categorized as a scaffold protein, playing a significant role in maintaining cell polarity and synaptic function. Lin-7 homolog A is characterized by its L27 and PDZ domains, which facilitate interactions with other proteins, such as PALS1 and IRSp53, essential for cellular compartment organization and the formation of actin-rich protrusions like filopodia and neurites (Gruel2016LIN7A; Crespi2012LIN7). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including membrane dynamics, mitochondrial morphology regulation, and synaptic development, making it integral to both neuronal function and epithelial cell organization (ferrari2015role). Alterations in LIN7A expression have been linked to diseases such as breast cancer and neurological disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Gruel2016LIN7A; Crespi2012LIN7).

## Structure
LIN7A is a scaffold protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining cell polarity and synaptic function. It contains an L27 domain and a PDZ domain, both of which are essential for its interactions with other proteins. The L27 domain is involved in forming complexes with proteins like PALS1, which is part of the Crumbs complex, crucial for organizing cellular compartments and maintaining apico-basal polarity (Gruel2016LIN7A). The PDZ domain mediates protein-protein interactions, including those with IRSp53, which is important for the formation of actin-rich cellular protrusions such as filopodia and neurites (Crespi2012LIN7).

LIN7A is known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its function and interactions. The protein also has splice variant isoforms, which may influence its role in different cellular contexts (Gruel2016LIN7A). In the context of breast carcinogenesis, LIN7A over-expression is associated with increased cell proliferation and invasion, indicating its potential role in cancer progression (Gruel2016LIN7A). The structural domains of LIN7A, particularly the L27 and PDZ domains, are critical for its function in maintaining cell polarity and facilitating protein interactions.

## Function
LIN7A, a component of the crumbs cell polarity complex, plays a crucial role in maintaining cell polarity and epithelial cell organization. It is involved in the regulation of membrane dynamics, particularly in the formation of filopodia and neurites, which are essential for neuronal development and function (ferrari2015role; Crespi2012LIN7). LIN7A interacts with the insulin receptor substrate protein IRSp53, facilitating the recruitment of IRSp53 to the plasma membrane and promoting the extension of actin-filled protrusions (ferrari2015role; Crespi2012LIN7). This interaction is mediated by the L27 and PDZ domains of LIN7A, which are necessary for its localization and function in synaptic development (Crespi2012LIN7).

In addition to its role in membrane dynamics, LIN7A is implicated in mitochondrial morphology regulation. It influences mitochondrial fission through interaction with the Drp1-mediated pathway, affecting mitochondrial network morphology and dynamics (ferrari2015role). LIN7A's activity is primarily observed at cell junctions and in the nervous system, where it contributes to synaptic vesicle exocytosis and neuronal signaling, thereby playing a significant role in cellular communication and tissue integrity (ferrari2015role).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LIN7A gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in breast cancer and neurological disorders. In breast carcinomas, especially invasive micropapillary carcinoma (IMPC), LIN7A is significantly over-expressed. This over-expression is associated with defects in cell polarity, leading to increased cell proliferation and invasion, which are critical factors in cancer progression (Gruel2016LIN7A). The study by Gruel et al. suggests that LIN7A over-expression activates pathways such as MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT, contributing to tumor growth and invasiveness (Gruel2016LIN7A).

In the context of neurological disorders, LIN7A is involved in synaptic development and the formation of actin-rich structures like filopodia and neurites. Alterations in LIN7A expression or mutations affecting its interaction with proteins such as IRSp53 have been linked to conditions like attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (ferrari2015role; Crespi2012LIN7). These interactions are crucial for proper neuronal development and synaptic function, and disruptions can lead to neurodevelopmental disorders (Crespi2012LIN7). The LIN7-IRSp53 complex is essential for maintaining the stability and function of actin-rich structures, which are vital for neuronal signaling and synaptic vesicle trafficking (ferrari2015role).

## Interactions
LIN7A, a component of the crumbs cell polarity complex, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for maintaining cell polarity and function. LIN7A interacts with DLG2-isoform 7/8 in neuroblastoma cells, where it plays a role in tumor progression and cell growth regulation. This interaction is facilitated by the L27 domain of DLG2-iso7, which allows binding to LIN7A, influencing LIN7A expression levels and impacting cell proliferation and apoptosis (Keane2021The).

In breast carcinomas, LIN7A is part of the Crumbs complex and interacts with proteins involved in cell polarity, adhesion, and signaling. It contains an L27 domain that stabilizes PALS1 and a PDZ domain that binds to other proteins, potentially interacting with tyrosine-kinase receptors like INSULIN R and AXL, promoting proliferation and invasion (Gruel2016LIN7A).

LIN7A also interacts with IRSp53, a protein involved in the formation of filopodia and neurites. This interaction is mediated through LIN7A's PDZ and L27 domains, which are essential for the proper formation of actin-rich protrusions. LIN7A's role in recruiting IRSp53 into multiprotein complexes is crucial for neuritogenesis and synaptic development (Crespi2012LIN7).
