# MICU2

## Overview
MICU2 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial calcium uptake 2 protein, a critical regulatory component of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex. This protein plays a pivotal role in modulating calcium uptake into mitochondria, acting as a gatekeeper to prevent calcium overload, which can lead to cellular damage. MICU2, characterized by its EF-hand motifs, forms dimers and interacts with MICU1 to regulate the activity of the MCU complex. This interaction is essential for maintaining calcium homeostasis by setting the threshold for calcium uptake based on cytosolic calcium levels (Kamer2019Crystal; Payne2017MICU2). The regulatory function of MICU2 is crucial in various physiological processes, and its dysregulation has been implicated in cardiovascular diseases, highlighting its significance in cellular and systemic health (Bick2017Cardiovascular).

## Structure
The MICU2 protein is a component of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex and plays a crucial role in regulating calcium uptake in mitochondria. The primary structure of MICU2 includes a sequence that allows it to form a dimer, both in the presence and absence of calcium ions (Kamer2019Crystal). The secondary structure of MICU2 is characterized by EF-hand motifs, which are helix-loop-helix structures that bind calcium ions. These motifs are organized into two lobes, each containing a pair of EF-hands, with EF1 and EF4 capable of binding calcium (Kamer2019Crystal; Wu2019The).

The tertiary structure of MICU2 reveals a dimeric arrangement with noncrystallographic twofold rotational symmetry. The C-terminal helix of MICU2 is structurally independent and flexible, playing a critical role in its function (Kamer2019Crystal). The quaternary structure involves the formation of homodimers and heterodimers with MICU1, stabilized by hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions (Wu2019The). The interaction between MICU1 and MICU2 is essential for the regulation of the uniporter's activity, with specific residues such as Arg352 in MICU2 being crucial for heterodimer formation (Wu2019The). The C-terminal helix is necessary for MICU2's regulatory role in calcium transport (Kamer2019Crystal).

## Function
MICU2 (mitochondrial calcium uptake 2) is a regulatory protein that plays a critical role in mitochondrial calcium handling. It is part of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex, where it functions alongside MICU1 to regulate calcium uptake into mitochondria. MICU2 is involved in setting the threshold and gain for MICU1-mediated inhibition and activation of the MCU, acting as a "gatekeeper" to prevent mitochondrial calcium overload, which can lead to cell damage (Payne2017MICU2).

In healthy cells, MICU2 modulates the threshold for MCU activation by adjusting the calcium concentration required for MICU1 to relieve its inhibitory effect on the uniporter. This fine-tuning ensures that calcium uptake occurs only when cytosolic calcium levels exceed a certain threshold, thus maintaining calcium homeostasis (Kamer2014MICU; Payne2017MICU2). MICU2's role is particularly important in the cooperative activation of MCU at higher calcium concentrations, where it lowers the threshold for activation and is necessary for full cooperative activation of the uniporter (Payne2017MICU2).

MICU2 is localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it forms a heterodimer with MICU1. This interaction is crucial for its regulatory function, as MICU2 requires MICU1 to exert its effects on the MCU complex (Kamer2014MICU; Kamer2017High‐affinity).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the MICU2 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cardiovascular diseases. MICU2 is a regulatory subunit of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter, and its deficiency can lead to cardiovascular dysfunction. In Micu2 knockout mice, the absence of MICU2 results in cardiac diastolic dysfunction and left atrial enlargement, likely due to delayed calcium reuptake and decreased relaxation rates in cardiomyocytes. This condition is associated with pathologic transcriptional changes, including sarcomere dysregulation and stress response pathways, which can model heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (Bick2017Cardiovascular).

Micu2-null mice also exhibit increased susceptibility to lethal abdominal aortic aneurysms when subjected to angiotensin II-induced hypertension. This is linked to increased expression of genes associated with aneurysm formation, such as Mmp3, Col3a1, and Col1a2, suggesting that MICU2 plays a crucial role in protecting the abdominal aorta from injury (Bick2017Cardiovascular). The deficiency of MICU2 affects mitochondrial calcium homeostasis, contributing to oxidative stress and inflammation, which are critical factors in cardiovascular pathologies (Bick2017Cardiovascular). These findings underscore the importance of MICU2 in maintaining cardiovascular health and its potential involvement in disease when dysregulated.

## Interactions
MICU2 is a regulatory protein that interacts with several components of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex, including MICU1 and MCU. MICU2 forms a heterodimer with MICU1 through a disulfide bond, which is crucial for its function in regulating calcium uptake in mitochondria (Patron2014MICU1). This interaction is dependent on a conserved cysteine residue, and mutations in this residue prevent dimer formation (Patron2014MICU1). The MICU1-MICU2 heterodimer acts as a gatekeeper for the uniporter, modulating calcium uptake based on cytosolic calcium concentrations (Wu2020The).

MICU2 is not essential for the gatekeeping function but modulates the threshold for MCU activation by interacting with MICU1, adjusting the calcium concentration threshold for relief of inhibition (Payne2017MICU2). The heterodimer has a lower calcium affinity compared to MICU1 alone, aligning with MICU2's role in raising the calcium threshold for MCU activation (Payne2017MICU2). MICU2 also interacts with the mitochondrial phospholipid cardiolipin, which helps stabilize the MICU1-EMRE interaction and facilitates Ca2+-dependent regulation of the uniporter (Kamer2017High‐affinity). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory roles of MICU2 in mitochondrial calcium signaling.
