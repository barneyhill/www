# ATG14

## Overview
ATG14 is a gene that encodes the autophagy-related protein 14, a pivotal component of the autophagy-specific class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) complex. This protein plays a crucial role in the initiation and regulation of autophagy, a cellular process essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to stress. As a part of the PI3K complex, autophagy-related protein 14 interacts with Beclin 1 and Vps34, facilitating the formation of autophagosomes by recruiting necessary proteins to the phagophore assembly site (Park2018ULK1; Itakura2008Beclin). The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is involved in processes such as nutrient sensing and energy balance (Mukhopadhyay2017ATG14). Its interactions with other proteins, including the SNARE protein syntaxin 17, underscore its role in the fusion of autophagosomes with endolysosomes, highlighting its importance in cellular degradation pathways (Liu2015ATG14; Diao2015ATG14).

## Function
ATG14 is a critical component of the autophagy-specific class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) complex, which is essential for the initiation of autophagy. It plays a significant role in autophagosome formation by recruiting other autophagy-related proteins to the phagophore assembly site. ATG14 interacts with Beclin 1 and Vps34 to form a complex distinct from the one formed by UVRAG, indicating its specific role in autophagy (Itakura2008Beclin). This complex is crucial for the production of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P), a lipid involved in recruiting proteins necessary for autophagosome formation (Park2018ULK1).

ATG14 localizes to isolation membranes, which are early structures in autophagosome formation, and is necessary for the stability and function of the autophagic machinery in healthy cells (Itakura2008Beclin). It is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is involved in cellular processes like nutrient sensing and response to stress, contributing to cellular homeostasis and energy balance (Mukhopadhyay2017ATG14). The coiled-coil domain of ATG14 is important for its interaction with Vps34 and Beclin 1, which is crucial for its function in autophagy (Itakura2008Beclin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the ATG14 gene, which plays a crucial role in autophagy, have been implicated in several diseases, particularly neurodegenerative disorders like Huntington's disease (HD). In HD models, the phosphorylation of ATG14 at serine 29 by ULK1 is impaired, leading to reduced Vps34 kinase activity, which is essential for autophagy regulation. This impairment is associated with the pathogenesis of HD, where mutant huntingtin protein aggregates disrupt cellular pathways, including autophagy (Wold2016ULK1mediated). 

The phosphorylation of ATG14 is also crucial for the degradation of polyglutamine proteins, which are linked to HD. Overexpression of a phosphorylated variant of ATG14 enhances the clearance of these proteins, suggesting that ATG14 phosphorylation could be a therapeutic target for HD (Wold2016ULK1mediated). 

In addition to neurodegenerative diseases, ATG14's role in autophagy suggests its potential involvement in other conditions where autophagy is disrupted, such as cancer and metabolic disorders. However, specific mutations or alterations in ATG14 directly linked to these diseases have not been detailed in the provided context (Fraiberg2020Genetic).

## Interactions
ATG14 is a crucial component in the autophagy process, interacting with various proteins to facilitate autophagosome formation and fusion with endolysosomes. It forms a complex with Beclin 1 and VPS34, essential for autophagosome formation, and interacts with the coiled-coil domain of Beclin 1, which is critical for its function in autophagy (Mei2016Identification; Itakura2008Beclin). ATG14 also interacts with the SNARE protein syntaxin 17 (STX17) through its coiled-coil domain, stabilizing the STX17-SNAP29 binary t-SNARE complex on autophagosomes, which is crucial for their fusion with endolysosomes (Liu2015ATG14; Diao2015ATG14).

ATG14's interaction with STX17 is dependent on its homo-oligomerization, which involves cysteine repeats necessary for SNARE binding and fusion promotion (Liu2015ATG14). It also enhances the lipid kinase activity of the VPS34-p150-Beclin 1 complex, although this function is independent of its role in SNARE-mediated fusion (Diao2015ATG14). ATG14 interacts with ATG13, mediating the interaction between the ULK1 complex and the ATG14-containing PtdIns3K complex, and is phosphorylated by ULK1 and ULK2, which regulates its activity in autophagy (Park2016The).
