# RRP7A

## Overview
RRP7A is a gene that encodes the ribosomal RNA processing 7 homolog A protein, which is integral to ribosome biogenesis and rRNA processing. This protein is categorized as a nucleolar protein due to its localization and function within the nucleolus, where it plays a pivotal role in the assembly of the small subunit (SSU) processosome complex, essential for the maturation of 18S rRNA. Beyond its involvement in ribosome assembly, RRP7A is implicated in cell cycle regulation and neurogenesis, with expression observed in radial glial cells during brain development. Mutations in RRP7A, such as the p.W155C missense mutation, have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders like primary microcephaly, highlighting its clinical significance in brain development and function (Farooq2019RRP7A; Farooq2020RRP7A).

## Function
The RRP7A gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in ribosome biogenesis and rRNA processing in healthy human cells. It is involved in the assembly of the small subunit (SSU) processosome subcomplex UTP-C, which is essential for the proper processing of pre-rRNA, particularly the formation of 18S rRNA, a component of the ribosomal small subunit (Farooq2020RRP7A). RRP7A localizes to the nucleoli, the primary site of ribosome biogenesis, where it interacts with nucleolar proteins such as NOL6 to facilitate the assembly and function of the SSU processosome complex (Farooq2020RRP7A).

In addition to its role in ribosome assembly, RRP7A is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle and neurogenesis. It is expressed in radial glial cells in the developing human brain, indicating its importance in brain development and neural differentiation (Farooq2019RRP7A; Farooq2020RRP7A). The protein also localizes to centrosomes and primary cilia, where it is implicated in ciliary resorption, a process crucial for cell cycle progression and neural progenitor cell proliferation (Farooq2020RRP7A). Mutations in RRP7A can lead to defects in these processes, resulting in neurodevelopmental disorders such as primary microcephaly (Farooq2020RRP7A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RRP7A gene are linked to primary microcephaly (MCPH), a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by reduced brain size and intellectual disability. A specific homozygous missense mutation, p.W155C, has been identified in affected individuals from a consanguineous family, leading to defects in neurogenesis and proliferation (Farooq2020RRP7A; Farooq2019RRP7A). This mutation results in impaired ribosomal RNA processing, particularly affecting the production of 18S rRNA, and leads to proteolytic degradation of the RRP7A protein (Farooq2020RRP7A; Farooq2019RRP7A). 

The mutation also disrupts the interaction between RRP7A and NOL6, a factor involved in pre-rRNA processing, which compromises the formation of the 18S rRNA and affects the SSU processosome complex (Farooq2020RRP7A). In patient-derived fibroblasts, this mutation is associated with defects in ciliary resorption and cell cycle progression, leading to slower cell proliferation and delayed cell cycle transitions (Farooq2020RRP7A). Zebrafish models with RRP7A mutations exhibit similar phenotypes, including reduced brain size and impaired neurogenesis, further supporting the gene's role in brain development (Farooq2020RRP7A). These findings underscore the clinical significance of RRP7A mutations in contributing to developmental brain disorders such as primary microcephaly.

## Interactions
RRP7A is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in ribosome biogenesis and cellular processes. It interacts with Nucleolar Protein 6 (NOL6), also known as UTP22, as part of the small subunit (SSU) processosome complex. This interaction is crucial for the proper formation of 18S rRNA, a component of the ribosomal small subunit. The p.W155C mutation in RRP7A significantly reduces its interaction with NOL6, leading to defects in rRNA processing and nucleolar localization of NOL6, which affects the recruitment of the RRP7A-NOL6-containing SSU processosome complex (Farooq2020RRP7A).

RRP7A also interacts with Nucleolar Protein 12 (NOL12), although this interaction is not affected by the p.W155C mutation, nor is the nucleolar localization of NOL12 altered (Farooq2020RRP7A). These interactions highlight RRP7A's role in the assembly and function of ribosomal subunits. Additionally, RRP7A is part of the UTP-C subcomplex, which includes Utp22 and Casein Kinase 2, and is involved in binding transcription factors like Ifh1, forming the CURI complex that regulates ribosomal protein gene transcription (Farooq2020RRP7A).
