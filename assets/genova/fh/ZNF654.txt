# ZNF654

## Overview
ZNF654 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 654, which is part of the zinc finger protein family known for their role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which facilitate interactions with DNA, RNA, or other proteins, thereby influencing gene expression and cellular processes. The ZNF654 gene has been studied in the context of its potential role as a tumor suppressor, particularly in ovarian cancer, where its expression levels are notably altered (Cody2009Characterization). Despite the absence of deleterious mutations in its coding regions, the underexpression of ZNF654 in malignant tissues suggests its involvement in tumorigenesis through non-classical mechanisms (Cody2009Characterization).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
ZNF654 has been implicated in ovarian cancer, where it is considered a candidate tumor suppressor gene. Studies have shown that ZNF654 is underexpressed in malignant serous ovarian cancer samples compared to normal ovarian surface epithelium samples. This underexpression is thought to result from transcriptional modifications rather than classical mechanisms of tumor suppressor gene inactivation, such as loss of heterozygosity (LOH) (Cody2009Characterization). Despite the low frequency of LOH in the region containing ZNF654, its expression is significantly lower in ovarian cancer samples, suggesting that alterations in its expression may play a role in ovarian tumorigenesis (Cody2009Characterization).

Mutation analysis of ZNF654 in ovarian cancer cell lines has not identified any deleterious mutations in the protein-coding regions. The variants found, such as c.881T > C, are present in both cancerous and non-cancerous samples and are unlikely to be pathogenic, as they are reported in the dbSNP Database with varying allele frequencies (Cody2009Characterization). The clinical significance of ZNF654 mutations remains unclear, but its altered expression levels are considered relevant to cancer suppression (Cody2009Characterization).
