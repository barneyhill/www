# HECA

## Overview
The HECA gene encodes the hdc homolog, a cell cycle regulator protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and genomic stability. This protein is primarily located in the cytoplasm and is involved in the regulation of the TORC1 signaling pathway, which is essential for cell cycle progression and tissue growth. HECA interacts with other cell cycle regulators, such as UNK and RPTOR, to modulate TORC1 activity, particularly in response to nutrient availability (Li2019Headcase). The gene is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, with notable expression in the spleen, prostate, and peripheral blood leukocytes (Wang2015The; Dowejko2009The). In addition to its fundamental role in cell cycle regulation, HECA has been identified as a potential biomarker for early-stage colorectal cancer, highlighting its clinical significance in oncology (Chien2006A).

## Function
The HECA gene, a human homolog of the Drosophila headcase gene, plays a significant role in regulating cell cycle progression and tissue growth. In healthy human cells, HECA is ubiquitously expressed at a basal level, with the highest expression in the spleen, prostate, and peripheral blood leukocytes (Wang2015The; Dowejko2009The). The HECA protein is primarily located in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with other cell cycle regulators to maintain normal cellular function and genomic stability (Wang2015The).

HECA is involved in the regulation of the TORC1 signaling pathway, specifically influencing S6 phosphorylation, which is crucial for cell cycle progression (Li2019Headcase). The protein forms a complex with UNK and RPTOR, suggesting a conserved function in regulating TORC1 activity in mammals (Li2019Headcase). This interaction is sensitive to nutrient conditions, indicating that HECA plays a role in adapting cell growth and division in response to environmental cues (Li2019Headcase).

In Drosophila, the headcase gene is involved in stress protection and regulating ecdysone levels during metamorphosis, a function that may be conserved in humans, contributing to HECA's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Giannios2021Systemic).

## Clinical Significance
The HECA gene, a homologue of the Drosophila headcase protein, has been identified as a novel tumor marker for early-stage colorectal cancer. Alterations in HECA expression are significantly associated with colorectal cancer, particularly in its early stages. Studies have shown that HECA expression is upregulated in early-stage colorectal cancer (Dukes' stage A or B) compared to later stages (C or D) and healthy individuals. This upregulation is observed in cancerous tissue, blood, and fecal samples, suggesting that HECA could serve as a non-invasive biomarker for early detection of colorectal cancer (Chien2006A).

In colorectal cancer cell lines, HECA expression varies, with some lines showing a substantial increase compared to a housekeeping gene, indicating its potential importance in human cancers (Chien2006A). The gene's expression is also noted in other tissues, such as the spleen and prostate, but its specific role in these tissues remains less clear (Chien2006A). The study of HECA in the context of colorectal cancer highlights its potential as a specific tumor marker, although its expression in other tissues suggests a broader role in human health and disease.
