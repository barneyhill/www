# TMEM214

## Overview
TMEM214 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 214, a member of the nuclear envelope transmembrane proteins (NETs) family. This protein is integral to various cellular processes, including gene regulation and mechanotransduction, particularly during muscle differentiation. TMEM214 is involved in the organization and expression of genes by recruiting them to the nuclear periphery, which is essential for muscle cell differentiation and maintaining the structural integrity of the genome (Meinke2020A; Meinke2019A). The protein's interactions with other NETs are crucial for proper gene positioning and regulation, and disruptions in these interactions are associated with conditions such as Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) (Meinke2020A; Meinke2019A). Additionally, TMEM214 interacts with proteins involved in the endoplasmic reticulum stress response, suggesting a role in apoptosis and autophagy (de2022Metabolic). Despite its identification in proteomic studies, the precise concentration and function of TMEM214 at the nuclear envelope in healthy human cells require further investigation (Cheng2023Comparative).

## Function
TMEM214 is a transmembrane protein involved in several cellular processes, including gene regulation and mechanotransduction, particularly during muscle differentiation. It is part of a group of nuclear envelope transmembrane proteins (NETs) that play a crucial role in the organization and expression of genes by recruiting them to the nuclear periphery to suppress their expression, which is essential for muscle cell differentiation (Meinke2020A; Meinke2019A). TMEM214's function in healthy cells involves maintaining the structural integrity and functional organization of the genome, potentially affecting muscle cell differentiation and function (de2022Metabolic).

TMEM214 is also implicated in genome organization at the nuclear envelope, where it interacts with other NETs to direct gene expression regulation. This interaction is crucial for maintaining proper gene positioning and regulation, which is disrupted in conditions like Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) (Meinke2020A; Meinke2019A). Although TMEM214 was identified in proteomic studies as a potential nuclear envelope protein, its exact concentration and function at the nuclear envelope in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated (Cheng2023Comparative).

## Interactions
TMEM214 is involved in various protein interactions that are significant for its role in cellular processes. It is known to interact with CASP4 (caspase 4), which is involved in the endoplasmic reticulum stress response, suggesting a role in apoptosis and autophagy (de2022Metabolic). In the context of Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy (EDMD), TMEM214 is part of a group of muscle-specific nuclear envelope transmembrane proteins (NETs) that are involved in gene repositioning and regulation during myogenesis. These NETs, including TMEM214, are implicated in mechanosignal transduction pathways that may contribute to the pathophysiology of EDMD by affecting gene expression and positioning (de2022Metabolic; Meinke2020A).

TMEM214 also shows considerable overlap in gene regulation with other NETs such as WFS1, TMEM38A, and NET39, indicating its involvement in a common pathway that influences gene expression during muscle development (Meinke2020A). These interactions suggest that TMEM214 plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to cellular stress, potentially through its participation in multiprotein complexes that regulate these processes (de2022Metabolic).
