# CAPN3

## Overview
CAPN3 is a gene that encodes the protein calpain 3, a muscle-specific member of the calpain family of calcium-dependent cysteine proteases. Calpain 3 is distinct from other calpains due to its unique structural features, including specific insertion sequences and domains that facilitate its specialized functions in skeletal muscle. This protein plays a critical role in muscle physiology, particularly in muscle remodeling, stress response, and maintenance of muscle integrity. It is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics and signal transduction pathways, which are essential for muscle growth, repair, and adaptation. Mutations in the CAPN3 gene are linked to limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A (LGMD2A), highlighting its clinical significance in muscle-related disorders (Richard1999Calpainopathy—A; de2010Calpain; Chen2021CAPN3:).

## Structure
Calpain 3 (CAPN3) is a muscle-specific calpain with a unique molecular structure that distinguishes it from other calpains. The primary structure of CAPN3 includes a large subunit with four domains: I-IV. Domain I is distinct, while Domain II contains the conserved cysteine protease domain, comprising protease core domains 1 (PC1) and 2 (PC2), which confer protease activity (Chen2021CAPN3:). CAPN3 also features three unique insertion sequences: NS at the N-terminus, IS1 within PC2, and IS2 between the calpain-type β-sandwich (CBSW) and penta-EF-hand (PEF) domains (Ono2016An).

The secondary structure of CAPN3 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its compact tertiary structure. The PEF domain binds four calcium ions, which is crucial for its function and homodimerization (Ono2016An). The CBSW domain is responsible for structural changes upon activation and enhances trimer formation (Chen2021CAPN3:).

In terms of quaternary structure, CAPN3 forms a homotrimer, a feature that is dependent on the PEF and CBSW domains (Hata2020A). CAPN3 undergoes rapid autolysis, generating N- and C-terminal fragments that can reconstitute protease activity through intermolecular complementation (iMOC) (Ono2014The). Various splice variants of CAPN3 exist, such as Lp82 and Lp85, which are expressed in specific tissues like the lens and retina (Chen2021CAPN3:).

## Function
Calpain 3 (CAPN3) is a unique member of the calpain family, primarily expressed in skeletal muscle, where it plays a crucial role in muscle physiology and maintenance. It is involved in muscle stress sensing, adaptive muscle growth, and remodeling after atrophy and exercise (Hata2020A). CAPN3 functions as a proteolytic switch, essential for muscle remodeling by regulating cytoskeletal dynamics and signal transduction pathways (de2010Calpain). It is activated by physiological concentrations of Na+ and Ca2+, with Na+ playing a significant role in its activation, a unique feature among calpains (Ono2016An).

CAPN3's proteolytic activity is tightly regulated through autolysis, which prevents excessive proteolysis and allows it to modulate protein levels without generating toxic waste products (de2010Calpain). It interacts with various proteins, such as Aldolase A, to localize them to muscle triads, where it regulates calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, crucial for muscle function (Ono2016An). CAPN3 also has non-proteolytic roles, such as binding to proteins in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which are important for muscle structure and function (Ojima2011NonProteolytic). These functions highlight CAPN3's role in maintaining muscle integrity and facilitating muscle growth, repair, and adaptation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CAPN3 gene are primarily associated with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A (LGMD2A), also known as calpainopathy. This autosomal recessive disorder is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting, particularly affecting the proximal limb muscles. Symptoms typically manifest in childhood and progress gradually, often leading to loss of ambulation within 10 to 20 years (LasaElgarresta2019Calcium; Richard1999Calpainopathy—A). 

CAPN3 mutations can also cause autosomal dominant limb-girdle muscular dystrophy-4 (LGMDD4), which presents with a later onset and milder phenotype compared to the recessive form (LasaElgarresta2019Calcium). Heterozygous missense variants in CAPN3 have been linked to autosomal-dominant calpainopathy, characterized by slowly progressive proximal myopathy and symptoms such as waddling walking and scapular winging. These variants often result in reduced calpain 3 levels and specific patterns of muscle weakness and degeneration (González‐Mera2020Heterozygous).

CAPN3 deficiency is associated with oxidative damage, calcium dysregulation, and impaired muscle regeneration, leading to inflammation, necrosis, and fibrosis (LasaElgarresta2019Calcium). The gene's role in apoptosis and muscle cell survival is also significant, as CAPN3 interacts with pathways that regulate these processes (LasaElgarresta2019Calcium).

## Interactions
CAPN3, also known as calpain 3, is a calcium-dependent cysteine protease that interacts with various proteins, playing a significant role in muscle function and maintenance. It binds to titin (TTN), a large protein that acts as a molecular spring in the sarcomere, at the N2A and M-line regions. This interaction is crucial for mechanosensory transduction pathways and sarcomere integrity (LasaElgarresta2019Calcium; Ono2016An). CAPN3 also interacts with dysferlin (DYSF), a protein involved in membrane repair, and its interacting protein AHNAK, suggesting a regulatory role in the DYSF complex (Ono2016An).

CAPN3 is involved in the degradation of the p53 protein in the nucleus, mediated by the Digestive organ Expansion Factor (DEF), which negatively regulates p53, affecting gene expression and cell cycle progression (Zhao2021Nucleoluslocalized; Ono2016An). It also interacts with proteins such as α-actinin-3, tropomyosin, and LIM-domain binding protein 3 at the Z-line, and stabilizes calcium-handling proteins like RyR1 and SERCA, contributing to calcium homeostasis (LasaElgarresta2019Calcium). These interactions highlight CAPN3's multifaceted role in muscle integrity and cellular processes.
