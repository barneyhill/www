# HGD

## Overview
The HGD gene encodes the enzyme homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase, a critical component in the catabolic pathway of the amino acids tyrosine and phenylalanine. This enzyme is categorized as a dioxygenase and is responsible for converting homogentisic acid into maleylacetoacetate, a key step in the breakdown of tyrosine. The enzyme's active form is a homohexamer, which is essential for its function. Mutations in the HGD gene can lead to alkaptonuria, a rare metabolic disorder characterized by the accumulation of homogentisic acid, resulting in ochronosis and other clinical symptoms. The enzyme is primarily expressed in the liver and kidney, but it is also present in various other tissues, underscoring its importance in maintaining metabolic homeostasis (Ascher2019Homogentisate; Karmakar2021HGDiscovery:; Zatkova2011Identification).

## Structure
The homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (HGD) enzyme is a key component in the catabolism of tyrosine and phenylalanine. Its active site features a 2-his-1-carboxylate facial triad, with iron coordinated by two histidines (His335, His371) and one glutamate (Glu341) (Borowski2005Catalytic). The enzyme forms a homohexameric structure, described as a dimer of trimers, with each monomer having its active site near the intersubunit interface (Borowski2005Catalytic). Additional residues such as His365 and His292 are involved in substrate binding and catalysis, with His365 forming a hydrogen bond with Glu341 and His292 interacting with the C4-bound hydroxyl group of homogentisate (Borowski2005Catalytic).

The quaternary structure of HGD is crucial for its function, as many missense mutations disrupt this hexameric assembly, leading to metabolic disorders like alkaptonuria (Bernini2017Toward). The enzyme's structure has been studied using molecular dynamics simulations, which identified transient pockets that could serve as potential targets for pharmacological chaperones to stabilize the enzyme (Bernini2017Toward). These pockets are located at the protomer-protomer interface, suggesting their role in maintaining the hexameric structure (Bernini2017Toward). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, and tertiary structures, as well as post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available excerpts.

## Function
The HGD gene encodes the enzyme homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase, which plays a crucial role in the catabolic pathway of the amino acids tyrosine and phenylalanine. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of homogentisic acid (HGA) into maleylacetoacetate, a necessary step in the breakdown of tyrosine (Ascher2019Homogentisate; Karmakar2021HGDiscovery:). The proper function of HGD is essential for preventing the accumulation of HGA, which can lead to the rare genetic disorder alkaptonuria (AKU) if not metabolized (Zatkova2011Identification).

In healthy human cells, the HGD enzyme is primarily expressed in the liver and kidney, but it is also found in other tissues such as the prostate, small intestine, colon, and osteoarticular compartments, including chondrocytes, synoviocytes, and osteoblasts (Karmakar2021HGDiscovery:; Laschi2012Homogentisate). The enzyme's active form is a hexamer, organized as a dimer of trimers, and its function relies on numerous noncovalent bonds that maintain its complex structure (Zatkova2011Identification). The HGD enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining normal cellular and organismal homeostasis by preventing the toxic accumulation of HGA, which can otherwise lead to ochronotic pigment deposition in connective tissues (Ascher2019Homogentisate).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HGD gene, which encodes the enzyme homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase, are responsible for alkaptonuria (AKU), a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder. This condition is characterized by the accumulation of homogentisic acid (HGA) due to a deficiency in the HGD enzyme, leading to symptoms such as dark urine, ochronosis, and arthritis (Ascher2019Homogentisate; Noorian2018A). The accumulation of HGA can also cause complications in organs like the heart valves and kidneys (Abdelkhalek2023Homogentisate).

Various mutations in the HGD gene have been identified, including missense, nonsense, splice site mutations, and small insertions/deletions. These mutations often affect conserved amino acid positions, leading to a pathogenic effect by altering the enzyme's structure and function (Nemethova2015Twelve; Habbal2014First). For instance, the G360R mutation is a well-documented missense mutation associated with AKU and has been identified in multiple populations, suggesting a potential founder effect (Porfirio2016A).

The clinical manifestations of AKU are primarily due to the deposition of ochronotic pigment in connective tissues, resulting in conditions such as aortic stenosis and early-onset severe arthropathy (Ascher2019Homogentisate). The disease's severity can vary based on the specific HGD variant and other factors like dietary protein intake (Ascher2019Homogentisate).
