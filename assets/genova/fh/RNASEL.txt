# RNASEL

## Overview
RNASEL is a gene that encodes the protein ribonuclease L, a key component of the antiviral defense mechanism in human cells. Ribonuclease L is classified as a pseudokinase ribonuclease, which plays a crucial role in the 2-5A system, an interferon-induced antiviral pathway. Upon activation by 2-5A oligoadenylates, ribonuclease L dimerizes and becomes active, leading to the degradation of viral and cellular RNA, thereby inhibiting viral replication. Beyond its antiviral functions, ribonuclease L is involved in regulating mRNA translation and stability, as well as inducing apoptosis through stress-activated pathways. The protein's interactions with various cellular components, including translation factors and androgen receptors, underscore its multifaceted role in cellular processes and its potential implications in disease pathogenesis, particularly in cancer (Bisbal2007Diverse; Hassel2012Pathologic; Silverman2007A).

## Structure
RNase L is a pseudokinase ribonuclease involved in the antiviral response. Its primary structure is encoded by the RNASEL gene and includes ankyrin repeat (ANK) domains, a pseudokinase (PK) domain, and an RNase domain (Huang2014Dimeric). The ANK domain consists of nine ankyrin repeats and a noncharacteristic α-helical element, which facilitates interdomain interactions (Huang2014Dimeric). The PK domain has a bilobal fold with a smaller N-terminal lobe and a larger C-terminal lobe, featuring a unique structure with substitutions at conserved positions, rendering it catalytically inactive (Huang2014Dimeric).

The tertiary structure of RNase L includes a ribonuclease active site located at the base of a deep cleft formed by the dimerization of two RNase domains. This site features a catalytic tetrad of Tyr663, Arg675, Asn676, and His680, along with Lys672 (Huang2014Dimeric). The quaternary structure involves the formation of a rigid dimer configuration, essential for its catalytic and antiviral functions. This dimerization is facilitated by interactions between the ANK and PK domains, forming a composite binding site for the 2-5A activator (Huang2014Dimeric). The presence of ADP restricts motion between the kinase lobes, contributing to the stability of the dimer (Huang2014Dimeric).

## Function
RNASEL, or ribonuclease L, is a crucial component of the 2-5A system, an antiviral pathway activated by interferons in response to viral infections. In healthy human cells, RNASEL remains inactive until it binds to 2-5A, which are oligoadenylates produced by 2-5A synthetases. This binding induces RNASEL dimerization, activating its ribonuclease activity, which leads to the degradation of viral and cellular RNA, thereby inhibiting viral replication (Bisbal2007Diverse; DONG2001Basis).

RNASEL is involved in several cellular processes, including the regulation of mRNA translation and stability, and apoptosis. It interacts with the translation termination release factor eRF3/GSPT1, affecting translation termination and ribosomal readthrough. RNASEL also regulates the stability of specific mRNAs, contributing to the antiproliferative effects of interferons (Bisbal2007Diverse).

In addition to its antiviral functions, RNASEL plays a role in apoptosis through stress-activated pathways, such as those involving JNK kinases. This activity is crucial for limiting viral spread and potentially suppressing tumor growth (Bisbal2007Diverse; Silverman2007A). RNASEL is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it exerts its effects on RNA metabolism and cellular stress responses (Bisbal2007Diverse).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RNASEL gene have been associated with an increased risk of several cancers, including prostate cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), uterine cervix cancer, and breast cancer. The R462Q variant, in particular, affects the enzyme's activity and has been linked to prostate cancer, with varying risk levels across different ethnic groups. It is associated with aggressive prostate cancer in Afro-Americans and early-stage disease in Euro-Americans (Madsen2008Germline; Silverman2003Implications). 

In prostate cancer, RNASEL mutations such as R462Q and E265X have been studied extensively. The R462Q variant is linked to more aggressive forms of the disease, while the E265X mutation has been found in both affected and unaffected individuals, suggesting it is not a high-penetrance risk variant (Wiklund2004Genetic; Silverman2003Implications). 

RNASEL mutations may also contribute to the development of pancreatic cancer, with the Arg462Gln variant being more prevalent in sporadic cases (Bartsch2005RNASEL). The gene's role in antiviral defense and apoptosis suggests that its mutations could increase susceptibility to viral infections, potentially influencing cancer development (Silverman2003Implications).

## Interactions
RNase L interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It forms a complex with the translation termination release factor eRF3, which can influence translation termination and ribosomal readthrough (Bisbal2007Diverse). RNase L is also inhibited by the RNase L inhibitor (RLI), which forms a complex with RNase L and eRF3, affecting rRNA cleavage and antiviral activities (Hassel2012Pathologic). Theiler's virus L* protein inhibits RNase L by binding to its ankyrin repeats, preventing 2-5A from binding and thus inhibiting RNase L activation (Drappier2018A).

RNase L interacts with the androgen receptor (AR), suggesting a potential tumor suppressive role in familial prostate cancer. This interaction is enhanced by dihydrotestosterone (DHT) treatment (Hassel2012Pathologic). RNase L also interacts with IQGAP1, a scaffold protein involved in cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation, which is necessary for ECyd-induced apoptosis (Hassel2012Pathologic). Additionally, RNase L interacts with RNA binding proteins such as HuR and TTP, impacting mRNA stability and degradation (Hassel2012Pathologic). These interactions highlight RNase L's complex regulatory roles in cellular processes and its potential involvement in disease pathogenesis.
