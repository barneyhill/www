# DEFB107A

## Overview
DEFB107A is a gene that encodes the protein defensin beta 107A, a member of the defensin family, which is known for its antimicrobial properties. Defensin beta 107A is a small cationic peptide that plays a significant role in the innate immune system by providing protection against a wide range of pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. The gene is located in the 8p22-p23 region of the human genome and is predominantly expressed in the testis, indicating a potential specialized function in the male reproductive tract's immune defense (Semple2003Duplication). The protein is notable for its unique amino acid composition, which includes a serine residue replacing the first canonical cysteine, suggesting a functional divergence from other β-defensins (Semple2003Duplication). This structural variation, along with a higher proportion of anionic residues, may influence its interaction with anionic membrane lipids and its antimicrobial efficacy (Semple2003Duplication).

## Function
DEFB107A encodes the protein defensin beta 107A, which is part of the defensin family known for their antimicrobial properties. These proteins are small cationic peptides that play a crucial role in the innate immune system by providing defense against a variety of pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses (Semple2003Duplication). DEFB107A is located in the 8p22-p23 region of the human genome and is expressed predominantly in the testis, suggesting a specific role in the male reproductive tract's innate defense mechanisms (Semple2003Duplication).

The DEFB107 protein is characterized by an unusual amino acid composition, including a serine residue replacing the first canonical cysteine, which may indicate functional divergence from other β-defensins (Semple2003Duplication). This alteration, along with a higher proportion of anionic residues, suggests that DEFB107 may interact differently with anionic membrane lipids, potentially affecting its antimicrobial activity (Semple2003Duplication). While the specific functions of DEFB107 in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, its expression pattern and structural characteristics imply a specialized role in reproductive immunity and possibly in linking innate and adaptive immune responses (Semple2003Duplication).
