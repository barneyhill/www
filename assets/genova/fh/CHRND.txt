# CHRND

## Overview
The CHRND gene encodes the delta (δ) subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), a transmembrane receptor that plays a pivotal role in neuromuscular transmission. This receptor is a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel, essential for converting chemical signals into electrical impulses at the neuromuscular junction, thereby facilitating muscle contraction. The δ subunit, along with other subunits, forms the functional nAChR complex, which undergoes a developmental transition from the embryonic to the adult form by replacing the γ subunit with the ε subunit. The CHRND gene's product is crucial for the proper functioning of the receptor, and mutations in this gene are linked to congenital myasthenic syndromes and lethal multiple pterygium syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance (Chen2023Case; Schaaf2014Nicotinic; Abicht2012Congenital).

## Structure
The CHRND gene encodes the delta (δ) subunit of the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), which is a component of the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel. The primary structure of the δ subunit includes a sequence of amino acids that form part of the muscle nAChR complex, specifically in the embryonic form, which consists of α1, β1, γ, and δ subunits. In the adult form, the γ subunit is replaced by the ε subunit (Hurst2013Nicotinic; Schaaf2014Nicotinic).

The secondary structure of the δ subunit is characterized by four transmembrane segments, which are consistent with its hydrophobicity profile. These segments contribute to the formation of the ion channel through which ions pass (Hurst2013Nicotinic). The extracellular domain of the nAChR subunits, including the δ subunit, is largely composed of β-sheets, while the transmembrane domains are α-helices (Albuquerque2009Mammalian).

The quaternary structure involves the assembly of the δ subunit with other subunits to form the functional nAChR complex. The δ subunit does not have the two adjacent cysteines in the N-terminal domain that are thought to be principal components of the ligand-binding site, unlike the α1 subunit (Hurst2013Nicotinic). Common post-translational modifications for the δ subunit may include glycosylation, as it encodes only one glycosylation site near the Cys-loop (Pedersen2019Evolution).

## Function
The CHRND gene encodes the delta (δ) subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), a crucial component of the neuromuscular junction. This receptor is a pentameric protein complex that facilitates synaptic transmission by binding acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter, which triggers a conformational change in the receptor. This change allows the flow of ions across the cell membrane, essential for muscle contraction and motor function (Chen2023Case; Schaaf2014Nicotinic).

The nAChR is composed of five subunits: two alpha (α) subunits, one beta (β), one delta (δ), and one gamma (γ) or epsilon (ε) subunit, depending on the developmental stage. The δ subunit, encoded by CHRND, is integral to the receptor's function in both fetal and adult forms, with the γ subunit being replaced by the ε subunit during late fetal development (Chen2023Case; Schaaf2014Nicotinic).

In healthy human cells, the CHRND gene's product is vital for effective neuromuscular transmission, ensuring proper muscle contraction and motor function. The receptor's activity is primarily localized at the neuromuscular junction, where it plays a key role in converting chemical signals into electrical events, leading to muscle contraction (CohenHaguenauer1989Localization).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CHRND gene, which encodes the delta subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR), are associated with several congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) and lethal multiple pterygium syndrome (LMPS). LMPS is a rare and fatal disorder characterized by multiple pterygium, arthrogryposis, akinesia, nuchal cystic hygroma, hydrops fetalis, and intrauterine growth retardation, often resulting in death. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and exhibits genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity. Mutations in the CHRND gene can lead to different types of CMS, including slow-channel CMS, fast-channel CMS, and AChR deficiency CMS (Chen2023Case).

The study by Chen et al. identified two novel mutations in the CHRND gene: c.1006C>T p.(Arg336Ter) and c.973_975delGTG p.(Val325del), which were discovered through whole-exome sequencing in a case of LMPS. These mutations affect the δ subunit of the AChR, crucial for nerve-muscle signaling during fetal development, and disrupt the formation and function of the receptor, leading to LMPS (Chen2023Case).

In CMS, mutations in CHRND, along with other AChR subunit genes, can result in muscle weakness due to defects in neuromuscular transmission. These mutations are typically autosomal recessive and may affect channel kinetics or reduce the number of AChRs at the neuromuscular junction (Steinlein2007Genetic; Abicht2012Congenital).
