# HDAC6

## Overview
HDAC6 is a gene that encodes the protein histone deacetylase 6, a unique member of the histone deacetylase family primarily localized in the cytoplasm. Unlike other histone deacetylases, HDAC6 is characterized by its two catalytic domains and a zinc finger ubiquitin-binding domain, which enable it to deacetylate non-histone proteins and interact with polyubiquitinated proteins (SimõesPires2013HDAC6; Osko2019Structural). The protein plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including microtubule dynamics, protein degradation, and stress responses, by modulating the acetylation status of key proteins such as α-tubulin and cortactin (Parmigiani2008HDAC6; Hubbert2002HDAC6). HDAC6's involvement in these processes has significant implications for its role in diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, making it a target for therapeutic interventions (Pulya2021HDAC6; Losson2020HDAC6—An).

## Structure
The human HDAC6 protein is composed of 1215 amino acid residues and features two independent catalytic domains, CD1 and CD2, which are crucial for its enzymatic activity (SimõesPires2013HDAC6; Hai2016Histone). These domains are involved in the deacetylation of non-histone proteins, such as α-tubulin, influencing microtubule dynamics (Hai2016Histone). The CD1 domain has a narrow substrate specificity, preferring peptide substrates with C-terminal acetyllysine residues, while CD2 shows broader substrate specificity (Osko2019Structural; Hai2016Histone).

HDAC6 also contains a unique zinc finger ubiquitin-binding domain at its C-terminus, which is involved in binding polyubiquitinated proteins and facilitating their transport to the aggresome for degradation (SimõesPires2013HDAC6). This domain is characterized by a compact structure of 5 antiparallel β-strands, 2 α-helices, and 3 zinc ions (SimõesPires2013HDAC6).

The protein's structure includes serine/glutamate-rich repeat motifs that anchor it in the cytoplasm and two leucine-rich nuclear export sequences that enable cytoplasmic/nuclear shuttling (SimõesPires2013HDAC6; Skultetyova2017Human). HDAC6 is subject to post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and S-nitrosylation, which regulate its activity and interactions (Skultetyova2017Human).

## Function
HDAC6 is a unique histone deacetylase primarily localized in the cytoplasm, where it plays a critical role in various cellular processes. It is involved in the deacetylation of α-tubulin, a key component of the microtubule network, which is essential for maintaining microtubule stability and dynamics. This activity is crucial for processes such as cell division, motility, and intracellular transport (Matthias2008HDAC6; Hubbert2002HDAC6). HDAC6's deacetylase activity is also linked to the regulation of cell motility by controlling microtubule acetylation, particularly at the leading edge of cells, which is important for chemotactic movement (Hubbert2002HDAC6).

HDAC6 is involved in the degradation of misfolded proteins through its role in aggresome formation and autophagy activation, processes that help maintain protein homeostasis and reduce cellular stress (Matthias2008HDAC6). It also regulates mitochondrial transport in neurons by modulating the acetylation of tubulin, which affects the interaction with motor proteins like kinesin-1, facilitating mitochondrial movement (Chen2010HDAC6). HDAC6's activity is implicated in cellular responses to oxidative stress by deacetylating redox regulatory proteins, which helps maintain redox balance (Parmigiani2008HDAC6).

## Clinical Significance
HDAC6 is implicated in various diseases due to its role in protein deacetylation and cellular processes. In cancer, HDAC6 is often overexpressed, contributing to tumor progression and metastasis. It is notably overexpressed in cancers such as chronic myeloid leukemia, prostate cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, and ovarian cancer, where it influences cell migration, angiogenesis, and metastasis formation (Losson2020HDAC6—An; Li2018Histone). HDAC6 inhibitors have shown promise in hematological malignancies like multiple myeloma and lymphoproliferative diseases, where they enhance the effects of other cancer therapies (Cosenza2018The).

In neurodegenerative diseases, HDAC6 is involved in the regulation of protein aggregates and axonal transport. Its inhibition has shown neuroprotective effects in conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease by enhancing the degradation of misfolded proteins and improving axonal transport (Pulya2021HDAC6; Brindisi2019Old). In Alzheimer's disease, HDAC6 affects tau protein accumulation, and its inhibition can promote tau degradation (Cook2012Loss).

HDAC6 is also implicated in rare diseases like Rett syndrome and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, where its dysregulation affects microtubule dynamics and cellular stress responses (Brindisi2019Old). These diverse roles make HDAC6 a significant target for therapeutic interventions across a range of diseases.

## Interactions
HDAC6 interacts with a variety of proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes such as protein degradation, cell motility, and stress response. It forms complexes with proteins like tau, Hsp90, and p62/SQSTM1. The interaction with tau is mediated by the microtubule binding domain on tau and the SE14 domain on HDAC6, which is relevant in Alzheimer's disease pathology (Ding2008Histone). HDAC6 also interacts with Hsp90, regulating its stability and function. This interaction is crucial for the stability of other client proteins and is involved in various diseases, including cancer and Parkinson's disease (Liu2021Posttranslational).

HDAC6's interaction with p62/SQSTM1 is important for regulating its deacetylase activity and is involved in the autophagic clearance of protein aggregates. This interaction is essential for the perinuclear co-localization of cortactin-F-actin assemblies, which is crucial for autophagic processes (Yan2013SQSTM1p62). HDAC6 also binds to ubiquitinated proteins through its C-terminal BUZ/ZnF-UBP domain, facilitating the transport of protein aggregates to the aggresome (Yan2014Interplay).

HDAC6 interacts with the motor protein dynein, aiding in the transport of polyubiquitinated proteins into autophagosomes, which is vital for the aggresome-autophagy pathway (Liu2021Posttranslational). It also forms complexes with proteins like PRKN and is involved in autophagosome maturation through the deacetylation of cortactin (Bahram2024A).
