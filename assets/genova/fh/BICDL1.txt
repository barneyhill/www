# BICDL1

## Overview
BICDL1 is a gene that encodes the protein BICD family like cargo adaptor 1, which plays a critical role in intracellular transport processes. This protein functions as an activating adaptor within the dynein-dynactin complex, facilitating the movement of cellular components along microtubules. Characterized by its coiled-coil domain, BICD family like cargo adaptor 1 is involved in recruiting dynein dimers, although it does so with less efficiency compared to other adaptors such as BICD2 (ReckPeterson2018The). The protein's structure and function are influenced by post-translational modifications and alternative splicing, which may affect its interactions with cargo and motor proteins. BICDL1 has been implicated in various biological processes and diseases, including chlamydial infections, sporadic Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and glioblastoma multiforme, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Huang2022Integrating; Grima2023RNA; Wijethilake2021Glioma; Wang2019A).

## Structure
BICDL1, also known as BICD family like cargo adaptor 1, is a protein involved in intracellular transport processes, particularly in association with the dynein-dynactin complex. The protein features a coiled-coil domain, which is crucial for its function as an activating adaptor. This coiled-coil structure runs along the length of the dynactin filament, with the N-terminus near the barbed end and the C-terminus contacting the pointed end complex (ReckPeterson2018The). The coiled-coil domain facilitates the recruitment of dynein dimers, aligning their motor domains to bind microtubules and enhancing movement over long distances (ReckPeterson2018The).

BICDL1 is capable of recruiting two dynein dimers simultaneously, although this recruitment is less efficient compared to other adaptors like BICD2 (ReckPeterson2018The). The protein interacts with the dynactin complex differently towards the pointed end due to the lack of conserved motifs (ReckPeterson2018The). Structural predictions and refinements using tools like Alphafold and COOT have been employed to model the full-length BICDL1, particularly focusing on its N-terminus and C-terminus regions (Chaaban2022Structure).

BICDL1 is also associated with post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which may regulate its function. Splice variants of BICDL1 can result in different isoforms, potentially affecting its interaction with cargo and motor proteins.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
BICDL1 (BICD family like cargo adaptor 1) has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through its altered expression and interactions. In the context of persistent chlamydial infection, BICDL1 is downregulated, which is associated with the slow development of Chlamydia trachomatis during the persistent stage. This suggests that BICDL1 may play a role in regulating Chlamydia development, potentially impacting the progression of the infection (Huang2022Integrating).

In sporadic Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (sALS), BICDL1 exhibits significant differential transcript usage between patients and controls, indicating its potential involvement in the disease's molecular mechanisms (Grima2023RNA).

BICDL1 is also identified as one of the genes in a prognostic nomogram for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), suggesting its expression levels may be significant in predicting patient survival outcomes (Wijethilake2021Glioma; Wang2019A).

In pigs, BICDL1 is a candidate gene associated with variations in inorganic phosphate levels, although its direct clinical significance in humans is not detailed (Reyer2019Genetic). Additionally, BICDL1 has been mentioned in the context of genetic adaptations in Tibetans, though specific clinical implications are not provided (Zheng2023Largescale).
