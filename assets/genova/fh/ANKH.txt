# ANKH

## Overview
The ANKH gene encodes the ANKH inorganic pyrophosphate transport regulator, a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) transport across cell membranes. This protein is integral to maintaining PPi homeostasis, which is crucial for preventing pathological mineralization and ensuring bone health. The ANKH protein is characterized by its unique structure, featuring multiple transmembrane domains and a lack of homology with other known proteins, underscoring its specialized function in cellular processes (Williams2002Autosomal; Seifert2016The). It is involved in clathrin-mediated membrane trafficking and interacts with various proteins to regulate extracellular PPi and citrate levels, impacting bone matrix composition and joint health (Seifert2016The; Szeri2020The). Mutations in the ANKH gene are linked to several disorders, including craniometaphyseal dysplasia and calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal deposition disease, highlighting its clinical significance in bone and joint pathologies (Williams2003Familial; Kanaujiya2018Rapid).

## Structure
The ANKH protein is a highly hydrophobic transmembrane protein with a predicted topology of 10 to 12 transmembrane domains, as suggested by computer modeling based on its hydrophobicity pattern (Williams2002Autosomal; Seifert2016The). It is highly conserved across species, with 82% sequence identity between humans and zebrafish, and a conserved proline at amino acid position 5 (Williams2002Autosomal; Ding2013Molecular). The ANKH protein does not share homology with any other known protein or protein domain, indicating a unique structure (Seifert2016The).

The protein is involved in clathrin- and adaptor-mediated membrane traffic, cycling between the trans-Golgi network (TGN), endosomes, and the plasma membrane (Seifert2016The). It contains a cluster of acidic residues within the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain and tyrosine-based YxxU motifs in the N-terminal domain, which are recognized by m-adaptin subunits of AP complexes, suggesting a role in transport via clathrin-coated vesicles (Seifert2016The). The protein's function and localization are influenced by its interaction with clathrin and adaptor protein complexes, crucial for its role in membrane traffic (Seifert2016The). The ANKH protein may also undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, although specific details are not provided in the context.

## Function
The ANKH gene encodes a transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) transport across cell membranes, which is essential for maintaining PPi homeostasis. This protein is involved in the export of ATP and citrate from cells, with ATP being rapidly converted into PPi extracellularly, a process that is vital for preventing pathological mineralization of joints and maintaining bone health (Szeri2020The). ANKH is expressed in various tissues, including osteoblasts, cartilage, and vascular smooth muscle cells, where it influences bone matrix composition and strength by regulating the incorporation of citrate and PPi into hydroxyapatite, a component of bone (Williams2003Familial; Szeri2020The).

In healthy human cells, ANKH helps maintain the balance between PPi and inorganic phosphate (Pi), which is crucial for normal mineralization processes in bones and teeth (Collins2011It). The protein's activity is linked to bone strength and stability, as citrate stabilizes hydroxyapatite nanocrystals, preventing ectopic mineralization (Szeri2020The). ANKH's function extends to the regulation of extracellular citrate concentrations, impacting bone mechanical performance and joint health (Szeri2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ANKH gene are associated with several disorders, primarily affecting bone and joint health. Craniometaphyseal dysplasia (CMD) is a condition linked to mutations in the ANKH gene, characterized by progressive thickening of craniofacial bones and flaring of the metaphyses of long bones. This disorder can lead to symptoms such as blindness, deafness, facial palsy, and severe headaches due to neuronal compression. CMD mutations result in decreased levels of the ANKH protein due to rapid degradation and mislocalization within the cytoplasm, contributing to the disease's pathogenesis (Kanaujiya2018Rapid).

The ANKH gene is also implicated in calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystal deposition disease, a condition characterized by abnormal calcium crystal deposits in the joints. Mutations in the amino terminal region of ANKH are linked to familial CPPD, leading to altered pyrophosphate metabolism and increased extracellular pyrophosphate levels, which promote crystal deposition (Williams2002Autosomal; Williams2003Familial; Williams2003Mutations).

Additionally, a novel mutation in the ANKH gene has been associated with autosomal recessive mental retardation, deafness, ankylosis, and mild hypophosphatemia, highlighting the gene's role in various bone and cartilage pathologies (Morava2011Autosomal).

## Interactions
ANKH, the ANKH inorganic pyrophosphate transport regulator, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. ANKH interacts with clathrin and clathrin-associated adaptor protein (AP) complexes, which are crucial for its localization and cycling between the trans-Golgi network (TGN), endosomes, and the plasma membrane. This interaction is essential for maintaining proper membrane traffic at the TGN/endosomal interface (Seifert2016The).

Mutations in ANKH can affect its cellular localization and interactions. For instance, certain ANKH mutants have been shown to interact with the autophagy marker LC3, indicating a role in autophagic processes. These interactions are linked to the pathogenesis of conditions like calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPDD) and craniometaphyseal dysplasia (CMD) (Vijen2020Differences).

ANKH also interacts with proteins involved in pyrophosphate metabolism, such as ENPP1 and TNAP. These interactions are significant for regulating extracellular inorganic pyrophosphate levels and influencing processes like mineralization and inflammation (Vijen2020Differences). These protein interactions highlight ANKH's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its involvement in various pathological conditions.
