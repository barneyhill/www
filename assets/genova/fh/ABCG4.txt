# ABCG4

## Overview
ABCG4 is a gene that encodes the ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 4 (ABCG4) protein, which is part of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane transporter and is specifically a half-transporter within the G subfamily. ABCG4 is primarily expressed in the brain and plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism, particularly in the transport of cholesterol and other sterols across cellular membranes. This function is vital for maintaining cholesterol homeostasis in neuronal cells. The protein is also involved in the regulation of amyloid precursor protein processing and γ-secretase activity, which are significant in the context of Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, ABCG4 influences cell proliferation and apoptosis, with implications in both neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, particularly in the development of drug resistance in certain cancer types (Mallappa2019Doxorubicin; Sano2016ABCG1; Wang2004ATPbinding).

## Structure
The ABCG4 protein is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, specifically the G subfamily, and is characterized as a half-transporter. It consists of a single nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) located at the N-terminus and six transmembrane domains (TMDs) in the C-terminal half (Engel2001The; Cserepes2004Functional). The primary structure of ABCG4 is composed of 646 amino acids, and it shares 72% identity with ABCG1, indicating a high degree of similarity (Cserepes2004Functional). 

The secondary structure likely includes six membrane-spanning helices, which are typical of the ABCG subfamily (Cserepes2004Functional). The tertiary structure is not explicitly detailed, but the protein's function as a transporter suggests a conformation that facilitates substrate binding and translocation across the membrane (Cserepes2004Functional). 

In terms of quaternary structure, ABCG4 can form homodimers and heterodimers with ABCG1, but not with ABCG2, which is essential for its function (Hegyi2016Functional). ABCG4 is not glycosylated, as indicated by studies showing no change in migration on a gel after tunicamycin treatment (Hegyi2016Functional).

## Function
The ABCG4 gene encodes a protein that is part of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, specifically involved in lipid metabolism and cholesterol transport. ABCG4 is primarily expressed in the brain, where it plays a significant role in cholesterol efflux to high-density lipoproteins (HDL), contributing to cellular cholesterol homeostasis (Wang2004ATPbinding; Annilo2001Human). It is involved in the translocation of cholesterol and other sterols across cellular membranes, which is crucial for maintaining lipid balance within neuronal cells (Yang2021Regulation).

ABCG4 is also implicated in the regulation of amyloid precursor protein processing and γ-secretase activity, which are important in the production of amyloid β, a peptide associated with Alzheimer's disease. By altering the localization of γ-secretase subunits from raft to non-raft domains in the cell membrane, ABCG4 reduces γ-secretase activity and decreases amyloid β secretion (Sano2016ABCG1).

In addition to its role in cholesterol transport, ABCG4 is involved in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis. It suppresses the proliferation of megakaryocyte progenitor cells and is associated with apoptotic cell death, potentially linked to reactive oxygen species production (Hegyi2016Functional; Sano2014ABCA1).

## Clinical Significance
ABCG4 has been implicated in several clinical contexts, particularly in relation to neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Alterations in ABCG4 expression have been associated with Alzheimer's disease, as increased levels of ABCG4 have been observed in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. This suggests a potential role in the disease's pathology, possibly through its involvement in cholesterol and lipid homeostasis, which may affect amyloid-beta processing (Bojanic2009Differential; Koshiba2008Human).

In the context of cancer, ABCG4 is linked to drug resistance in prostate cancer. The gene's upregulation is a key factor in the development of chemoresistance to drugs like doxorubicin and cisplatin in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. This resistance is mediated through mechanisms involving glutathione depletion and activation of the cAMP-regulatory element-binding protein (CREB), which transcriptionally upregulates ABCG4 expression. Targeting ABCG4 with statins has been shown to enhance the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy to overcome drug resistance (Mallappa2019Doxorubicin). ABCG4 is also implicated in drug resistance in non-small-cell lung cancer, although the mechanisms are not fully understood (Mallappa2019Doxorubicin).

## Interactions
ABCG4, a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, is known to participate in several protein interactions. It can form homodimers, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments where GFP-tagged ABCG4 was co-expressed with untagged ABCG4 in HEK293 cells, confirming dimer formation (Hegyi2016Functional). ABCG4 also forms heterodimers with ABCG1, its closest relative. This interaction was shown by co-expressing ABCG4 with the long isoform of ABCG1 in HEK293 cells, where both proteins were detected in the precipitate, indicating heterodimer formation (Hegyi2016Functional). The interaction between ABCG4 and ABCG1 is not only physical but also involves functional cooperativity, influencing processes such as apoptosis (Hegyi2016Functional).

ABCG4 does not form heterodimers with ABCG2, as only ABCG4 was detected in the precipitate when co-expressed with ABCG2 (Hegyi2016Functional). Additionally, ABCG4 interacts with the ubiquitin ligase NEDD4-1, facilitated by the adaptor protein Alix. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of ABCG4's protein stability, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Alrosan2019The).
