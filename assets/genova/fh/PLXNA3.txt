# PLXNA3

## Overview
PLXNA3 is a gene that encodes the protein plexin A3, a member of the plexin family of transmembrane receptors. Plexin A3 is primarily involved in semaphorin signaling, which plays a critical role in various cellular processes such as axon guidance, cell migration, and immune responses. The protein is characterized by its complex structure, including a sema domain, PSI domains, IPT domains, and a transmembrane domain, which are essential for its function in signal transduction (Barton2016Interplay; Barton2015A). Plexin A3 interacts with neuropilin 2 and semaphorins to regulate synaptic connectivity and excitability in the cerebral cortex, contributing to proper neural development and function (Khdour2022Neuropilin). Mutations or altered expression of PLXNA3 have been linked to neurological disorders and various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Oleari2019PLXNA1; Zhang2020Characterization).

## Structure
The PLXNA3 (plexin A3) protein is a member of the plexin family, characterized by its complex molecular structure. The primary structure of PLXNA3 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form various functional domains. The secondary structure includes alpha helices, particularly in the juxtamembrane (JM) domain, which contains heptad repeats crucial for oligomerization through hydrophobic interactions (Barton2015A). 

The tertiary structure of PLXNA3 features a sema domain, PSI domains, IPT domains, and a transmembrane domain, along with a cytosolic region homologous with Ras GTPase-activating proteins (Barton2015A). The transmembrane (TM) domain includes a glycine-rich region with small-x3-small packing motifs, which are essential for dimerization (Barton2016Interplay). 

In terms of quaternary structure, PLXNA3 forms homodimers, a process influenced by both the TM and JM domains. The JM domain's heptad repeat acts as a regulatory switch for homomeric interactions, with specific mutations affecting dimerization and signal transduction (Barton2016Interplay; Barton2015A). 

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur, although specific details are not provided in the context. Splice variants of PLXNA3 can result in different isoforms, potentially altering its function.

## Function
Plexin A3 (PLXNA3) is a transmembrane receptor involved in semaphorin signaling, which is crucial for various cellular processes, including axon guidance, cell migration, and immune responses. In healthy human cells, PLXNA3 plays a significant role in the regulation of synaptic connectivity and excitability within the cerebral cortex, particularly in layers 4 and 5. This regulation is essential for maintaining proper dendritic spine density and ensuring normal synaptic connectivity, which is vital for cortical maturation and function (Khdour2022Neuropilin).

PLXNA3 functions by forming receptor complexes with neuropilin 2 (Nrp2) and interacting with semaphorin 3F, which influences the pruning of supernumerary spines and the refinement of corticocortical connections. This signaling pathway is important for preventing hyperexcitability and excessive synchronization in neuronal networks, thereby contributing to the proper development and function of the cerebral cortex (Khdour2022Neuropilin).

At the molecular level, PLXNA3 dimerization is regulated by its transmembrane (TM) and juxtamembrane (JM) domains. These domains facilitate homodimerization, which is crucial for signal transduction. Mutations in these regions can affect dimerization and, consequently, the protein's function in cellular signaling pathways (Barton2016Interplay; Barton2015A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PLXNA3 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions. In the context of neurological disorders, PLXNA3, along with PLXNA1, plays a crucial role in the migration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons. The combined loss of these genes in mouse models results in significant defects in the olfactory and GnRH neuron systems, leading to a phenotype similar to Kallmann syndrome (KS), characterized by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and anosmia (Oleari2019PLXNA1). This suggests that mutations in PLXNA3 could be implicated in KS and potentially other congenital diseases affecting gonad formation (Oleari2019PLXNA1).

In cancer, PLXNA3 is frequently upregulated and associated with poor prognosis across various cancer types, including colon adenocarcinoma, kidney clear cell carcinoma, and prostate adenocarcinoma. Its increased expression is linked to worse overall survival and progression-free intervals, indicating its role as a potential biomarker for cancer prognosis (Zhang2020Characterization). PLXNA3's involvement in cancer progression is further supported by its association with tumor aggressiveness and metastatic potential (Zhang2020Characterization).

## Interactions
Plexin A3 (PLXNA3) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in signal transduction and cellular processes. PLXNA3 interacts with neuropilin 2 (Nrp2) to regulate functional connectivity and excitability in the cerebral cortex, particularly in layers 4 and 5. This interaction is essential for controlling dendritic spine densities and maintaining proper synaptic connectivity, as evidenced by studies using knockout mice models (Khdour2022Neuropilin). 

PLXNA3 also forms receptor complexes with other type A plexins and can be activated by semaphorins such as Sema3B, Sema3C, and Sema3G. This interaction is significant for the pruning of excess thalamocortical connections during cortical maturation (Khdour2022Neuropilin). 

Additionally, PLXNA3 cooperates with PLXNA1 in the patterning of nasal axons that guide gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons. This cooperation is crucial for proper GnRH neuron migration and olfactory system development, acting as co-receptors for SEMA3A during axon development (Oleari2019PLXNA1). These interactions highlight the role of PLXNA3 in neural development and connectivity.
