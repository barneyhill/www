# CENPE

## Overview
CENPE is a gene that encodes the centromere protein E, a kinesin-like motor protein that plays a pivotal role in chromosome alignment and segregation during cell division. As a member of the kinesin superfamily, centromere protein E is involved in the stable attachment of kinetochores to microtubules, facilitating proper chromosome movement and ensuring genomic stability during mitosis. The protein's structure includes a motor domain responsible for ATP binding and microtubule interaction, as well as a C-terminal region that interacts with kinetochore proteins. Beyond its canonical role in mitosis, centromere protein E is also implicated in maintaining centrosome integrity during interphase. Mutations in the CENPE gene are associated with developmental disorders such as microcephalic primordial dwarfism, and its altered expression is linked to various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (McEwen2001CENPE; Hao2019Expression; Mirzaa2014Mutations).

## Structure
CENPE (centromere protein E) is a large fibrous protein that plays a critical role in chromosome alignment during cell division. It is a dimeric kinesin, consisting of 2701 amino acids, and features a 230 nm flexible α-helical coiled-coil region that separates its motor domains from the C-terminal kinetochore binding domain (Mirzaa2014Mutations). The motor domain, located at the N-terminus, is responsible for ATP binding and microtubule interaction, essential for spindle-kinetochore attachment (Kumar2013Evolution). This domain hydrolyzes ATP to produce mechanical force along microtubules, with specific residues such as Arg12, Arg14, and Pro15 being crucial for ATP hydrolysis (Kumar2013Evolution).

The C-terminal region of CENPE contains a CAAX box, a signal for farnesyl modification, which is crucial for its role in fibrous corona formation at kinetochores (Wu2023A). Farnesylation allows CENPE to interact with the RZZ-S complex, promoting fibrous corona expansion (Wu2023A). The COOH-terminal region, specifically residues 1958 to 2662, is involved in kinetochore binding but does not colocalize with microtubules, suggesting that mitotic phosphorylations inhibit microtubule binding by this region (Chan1998Characterization). CENPE is predicted to form a homodimer, supported by coiled-coil interactions within its structure (Chan1998Characterization).

## Function
CENPE (centromere protein E) is a kinesin motor protein that plays a crucial role in cell division, particularly during mitosis and interphase. In mitosis, CENPE is essential for the stable attachment of kinetochores to microtubules, facilitating the alignment and segregation of chromosomes at the metaphase plate. It ensures proper kinetochore-microtubule interactions and generates tension across the centromere, which is vital for accurate chromosome segregation and genomic stability (McEwen2001CENPE).

Beyond its canonical role in mitosis, CENPE has a non-canonical function in maintaining centrosome integrity and the orientation of cell division during interphase. It is involved in the transport of pericentriolar material 1 (PCM1) away from centrosomes, which is crucial for the proper localization of Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) and the phosphorylation of pericentrin (PCNT). This process is essential for centrosome stabilization and the correct orientation of cell division (Owa2021A).

CENPE dysfunction is linked to developmental disorders such as microcephaly, highlighting its importance in normal brain development. Mutations in CENPE can lead to centrosome and cell division defects, underscoring its critical role in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis (Owa2021A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CENPE gene are associated with microcephalic primordial dwarfism (MPD), a group of syndromes characterized by developmental delay and other abnormalities. These mutations impair mitotic processes, leading to defects in spindle microtubule organization, mitotic progression, and chromosome segregation. This results in developmental disorders such as MPD, where affected individuals exhibit extreme microcephaly and other developmental abnormalities (Mirzaa2014Mutations).

In cancer, altered expression of CENPE is linked to tumor progression and poor prognosis. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), high CENPE expression correlates with poor overall survival, particularly in lung adenocarcinoma (Hao2019Expression). In medulloblastoma, CENPE is highly expressed in non-WNT/non-SHH subtypes, serving as an independent prognostic factor for survival. Its knockdown inhibits cell proliferation by activating the p53 pathway and blocking the cell cycle (Fang2023Primary). CENPE is also implicated in ovarian cancer, where its upregulation by ATAD2 promotes cell growth and metastasis. Inhibition of CENPE, particularly with the inhibitor GSK923295, shows potential as a therapeutic strategy in these cancers (Guruvaiah2023ATAD2).

## Interactions
CENP-E, a kinesin-like motor protein, plays a crucial role in chromosome alignment and segregation during mitosis through its interactions with various kinetochore proteins. One of its primary interactions is with the spindle checkpoint protein BubR1. This interaction is essential for chromosome alignment, as BubR1 binds to the C-terminal kinetochore-targeting domain of CENP-E with mid-nanomolar affinity, facilitated by the C-terminal helix of BubR1 and a small acidic patch on CENP-E (Legal2020The). This interaction is not dependent on post-translational modifications and is crucial for the rapid recruitment of CENP-E to kinetochores at the onset of spindle assembly checkpoint signaling (Legal2020The).

CENP-E also interacts with other kinetochore proteins, including CENP-F, Clasp2, and Mad1, forming part of a complex assembly pathway that ensures proper kinetochore function (Chan1998Characterization). The interaction with CENP-F is particularly significant, as both proteins are components of the kinetochore corona and are involved in chromosome segregation (Ciossani2018The). CENP-E's interaction with BubR1 is also linked to the activation of BubR1 kinase activity, which is necessary for mitotic checkpoint signaling (Mao2003Activating). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of CENP-E in maintaining chromosome stability during cell division.
