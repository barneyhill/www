# NLRP2B

## Overview
NLRP2B is a gene that encodes the protein NLR family pyrin domain containing 2B, which is a member of the NOD-like receptor (NLR) family. These proteins are involved in the regulation of inflammatory and immune responses. NLRP2B, like other NLR proteins, is characterized by the presence of a pyrin domain, which is crucial for its role in mediating protein-protein interactions within the immune signaling pathways. The protein encoded by NLRP2B is implicated in the modulation of inflammatory processes, potentially influencing the body's response to infections and other immune challenges. Understanding the function and regulation of NLRP2B is essential for elucidating its role in immune-related diseases and conditions (Qiu2020aarFDC).
