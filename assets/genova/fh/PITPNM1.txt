# PITPNM1

## Overview
PITPNM1 is a gene that encodes the protein phosphatidylinositol transfer protein membrane-associated 1, which is integral to lipid signaling and membrane trafficking processes. This protein is categorized as a membrane-associated protein and is involved in the phosphatidylinositol (PI) cycle, particularly in the replenishment of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) at the plasma membrane. The PITPNM1 protein contains a phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (PITP) domain and multiple EF-hand motifs, which are crucial for its function in phosphoinositide trafficking and calcium-mediated signaling pathways, respectively (Ocaka2004Chromosomal). It plays a pivotal role in the transfer of phosphatidic acid (PA) and PI between cellular membranes, facilitating essential cellular processes such as signal transduction and membrane dynamics (Cockcroft2016Topological). The protein's activity is regulated by interactions with other proteins, such as vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated proteins (VAPs) and extended synaptotagmins (E-Syts), which are critical for its localization and function at membrane contact sites (Raghu2021Emerging; Cockcroft2016Topological). Alterations in PITPNM1 expression have been linked to various diseases, including breast cancer and osteoarthritis, highlighting its clinical significance (Liu2021Attenuation; Li2020Inhibition).

## Structure
The PITPNM1 protein, encoded by the PITPNM1 gene, is involved in lipid signaling and membrane trafficking. It contains several distinct domains that contribute to its function. The N-terminal region includes a phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (PITP) domain, which is crucial for its role in phosphoinositide trafficking (Ocaka2004Chromosomal). The protein also features a C-terminal region with multiple EF-hand motifs, which are known for their calcium-binding capabilities, suggesting a role in calcium-mediated signaling pathways (Ocaka2004Chromosomal).

The molecular structure of PITPNM1 is characterized by these domains, which are conserved across related proteins. The calcium-binding domain is encoded by a single exon of 96 base pairs, indicating a compact and specific structural feature (Ocaka2004Chromosomal). The transmembrane regions of PITPNM1 are encoded across multiple exons, suggesting a complex tertiary structure that spans the membrane (Ocaka2004Chromosomal).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate the activity of PITPNM1, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context. Splice variants of PITPNM1 can lead to different isoforms, potentially resulting in distinct functional roles within the cell (Ocaka2004Chromosomal).

## Function
PITPNM1 is a membrane-associated protein that plays a critical role in the phosphatidylinositol (PI) cycle, particularly in the replenishment of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) at the plasma membrane in mammalian cells. It facilitates the transfer of PI from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the plasma membrane at membrane contact sites, which is essential for maintaining PI(4,5)P2 levels following receptor-induced hydrolysis (Cockcroft2016Topological). The translocation of PITPNM1 to ER-PM contact sites is driven by phospholipase C (PLC) activation, which increases cytosolic calcium levels, leading to the recruitment of E-Syt1 and a reduction in the distance between the ER and PM (Cockcroft2016Topological).

PITPNM1 is also involved in the transfer of phosphatidic acid (PA) between the plasma membrane and the ER, a process dependent on its PITP domain (Cockcroft2016Topological). This protein is crucial for the resynthesis of PI(4,5)P2 following PLC activation, and its depletion slows down this resynthesis, while overexpression accelerates it (Raghu2021Emerging). PITPNM1 is active during intense PLC stimulation, distinguishing its function from PITPNM2, which operates at lower levels of PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis (Cockcroft2016Topological).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PITPNM1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly breast cancer. High expression levels of PITPNM1 are associated with poor prognosis and overall survival in breast cancer patients. This gene is notably overexpressed in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and HER2 over-expressing subtypes, where it promotes cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway (Liu2021Attenuation). Silencing PITPNM1 in breast cancer cell lines has been shown to significantly inhibit cell proliferation and colony formation, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Liu2021Attenuation).

In addition to its role in cancer, PITPNM1 is involved in chondrogenesis and osteoarthritis (OA). The gene is targeted by miR-490-5p, which regulates its expression and impacts the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Inhibition of miR-490-5p, which upregulates PITPNM1, enhances chondrogenesis and protects chondrocytes, suggesting a therapeutic potential for OA treatment (Li2020Inhibition). These findings indicate that PITPNM1 plays a significant role in both cancer progression and cartilage-related diseases.

## Interactions
PITPNM1 interacts with several proteins and plays a crucial role in lipid transfer and signaling at membrane contact sites. It is known to associate with vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated proteins (VAPs) through its FFAT motif, which is essential for its localization to the endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane (ER-PM) contact sites following phospholipase C (PLC) activation (Raghu2021Emerging; Cockcroft2016Topological). This interaction is critical for the transfer of phosphatidylinositol (PI) and the replenishment of PI(4,5)P2, a process necessary after receptor-induced hydrolysis (Cockcroft2016Topological).

PITPNM1 also interacts with extended synaptotagmins (E-Syts), particularly E-Syt1, which is required for its recruitment to ER-PM contact sites. This interaction decreases the distance between the ER and PM, facilitating the bridging of the gap by PITPNM1 (Raghu2021Emerging). Additionally, PITPNM1 is involved in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, where it is targeted by miR-490-5p, a microRNA that regulates its expression. This interaction affects chondrogenesis and chondrocyte phenotypes, highlighting its role in cellular signaling and differentiation (Li2020Inhibition).
