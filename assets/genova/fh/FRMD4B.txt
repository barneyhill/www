# FRMD4B

## Overview
FRMD4B is a gene that encodes the FERM domain containing 4B protein, a scaffolding protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell signaling, adhesion, and structural organization. The protein is categorized as a scaffolding protein due to its role in maintaining epithelial cell integrity and regulating cell junctions and cytoskeletal dynamics. It is active in the cytoplasm and at cell junctions, where it influences tissue development and repair. FRMD4B is notably involved in the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, which is crucial for cellular growth and survival, and interacts with key proteins such as CYTH3 and PARD3 to maintain cell polarity and junction stability. The gene has clinical significance, with certain variants linked to conditions such as retinal disorders and heart failure, highlighting its importance in both cellular function and disease (Kong2018An; Cappola2010Common).

## Function
The FRMD4B gene encodes a scaffolding protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell signaling, adhesion, and structural organization. In healthy human cells, FRMD4B plays a critical role in maintaining epithelial cell integrity by regulating cell junctions and cytoskeletal dynamics. It is active in the cytoplasm and at cell junctions, where it influences tissue development and repair (Kong2018An).

FRMD4B is involved in the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, which is crucial for cellular growth and survival. Upon insulin stimulation, the wild-type FRMD4B protein translocates to the plasma membrane, co-localizing with sub-cortical actin fibers, indicating its role in cell signaling and membrane dynamics (Kong2018An). The protein also interacts with the Par-3 family cell polarity regulator (PARD3), which is essential for its localization to adherens junctions, further highlighting its role in maintaining cell polarity and junction stability (Kong2018An).

Additionally, FRMD4B is implicated in the myelination network, which is associated with cognitive function and neurodegenerative processes, suggesting its involvement in brain health and function (Jian2020Genomewide). These activities underscore the importance of FRMD4B in cellular organization and signaling.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FRMD4B gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. A specific variant, S938P, affects the membrane recruitment of FRMD4B, which is crucial for its function in cellular signaling pathways. This variant remains largely cytosolic even after insulin stimulation, unlike the wild-type FRMD4B, which translocates to the cell surface. This alteration is associated with reduced AKT phosphorylation, suggesting a hypoactive state of the PI3K-AKT pathway, which is important in various cellular processes (Kong2018An).

In the context of retinal disorders, the Tvrm222 variant of FRMD4B has been shown to suppress photoreceptor dysplasia in mouse models of enhanced S-cone syndrome and Nrl deficiency. This variant is associated with maintaining the integrity of the external limiting membrane (ELM) and reducing dysplastic lesions in the retina, indicating its potential role in stabilizing cell junctions (Kong2018An).

Additionally, common genetic variants in FRMD4B, such as SNP rs6787362, have been associated with advanced heart failure, particularly ischemic heart failure, in Caucasian populations. These variants may contribute to heart failure risk by influencing coronary artery disease susceptibility (Cappola2010Common).

## Interactions
FRMD4B is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It forms a complex with CYTH3, a protein that is sequestered in the cytoplasm under serum starvation and recruited to the plasma membrane upon insulin stimulation. This interaction is significant for the membrane recruitment of FRMD4B, although the S938P variant of FRMD4B shows reduced membrane recruitment without affecting its binding affinity to CYTH3 (Kong2018An).

FRMD4B also interacts with the Par-3 family cell polarity regulator (PARD3), which is essential for its localization to adherens junctions. The S938P variant is located in a region critical for binding PARD3, suggesting that this interaction influences the structural integrity of the retina by affecting the binding and cell surface targeting of FRMD4B (Kong2018An).

Additionally, FRMD4B is part of a complex with CYTH3 that interacts with AKT, a protein kinase involved in cell growth and development. This interaction is linked to reduced AKT phosphorylation in certain genetic variants, which may stabilize cell adhesions and influence cell junction dynamics in the retina (Kong2018An). These interactions highlight the role of FRMD4B in cell junction remodeling and cytoskeletal dynamics.
