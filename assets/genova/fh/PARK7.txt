# PARK7

## Overview
PARK7 is a gene that encodes the protein known as Parkinsonism associated deglycase, or DJ-1, which is a multifunctional protein involved in cellular protection mechanisms. DJ-1 functions primarily as a protein deglycase, playing a critical role in repairing proteins and amino acids that have been damaged by glycation, thereby preventing the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) (Unknownauthors2017DJ1PARK7). Additionally, DJ-1 is integral to maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular homeostasis, particularly under oxidative stress conditions. It acts as a redox-sensitive chaperone and stabilizes the antioxidant transcription factor Nrf2, enhancing the cellular defense against oxidative damage (Clements2006DJ1). Mutations in the PARK7 gene are linked to early-onset Parkinson's disease, as they can impair DJ-1's protective functions, leading to increased oxidative stress and neuronal degeneration (Skou2024Pathogenesis). DJ-1's involvement in various cellular processes, including mitochondrial quality control and autophagy, underscores its significance in neuroprotection and its potential as a therapeutic target in neurodegenerative diseases (Lee2018PARK7; Skou2024Pathogenesis).

## Structure
The PARK7 gene encodes the DJ-1 protein, which is involved in protecting cells from oxidative stress and maintaining mitochondrial function. The primary structure of DJ-1 consists of a sequence of 189 amino acids (Smith2017Structural). The secondary structure includes a six-stranded parallel β-sheet sandwiched by eight α-helices, with a β-hairpin on one end and a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet on the opposite end (Wilson2003The). A significant kink divides helices C and D, and there is a cis-Pro at position 66 (Wilson2003The).

The tertiary structure of DJ-1 forms a homodimer, which is the functional quaternary structure. The dimerization is facilitated by the C-terminal helix (α8) and involves an extensive network of packing interactions, suggesting that DJ-1 may be an obligate dimer (Smith2017Structural; Wilson2003The). The dimer interface is characterized by the arrangement of αA and αG helices, with additional contributions from the αH helices and the β3-β4 hairpin (Tao2003Crystal).

DJ-1 contains a conserved cysteine residue, Cys-106, which is crucial for its redox sensing activity and is sensitive to oxidative modifications (Smith2017Structural; Wilson2003The). The protein also undergoes post-translational modifications, including oxidation of Cys-106 to sulfinic acid, which affects its isoelectric point and function (Lee2003Crystal). DJ-1 has several isoforms due to alternative splicing, contributing to its functional diversity (Smith2017Structural).

## Function
The PARK7 gene encodes the DJ-1 protein, which plays a crucial role in protecting cells from oxidative stress and maintaining cellular homeostasis. DJ-1 functions as a protein deglycase, repairing proteins and amino acids damaged by glycation, a process that can lead to protein dysfunction and is associated with aging and diseases such as diabetes (Unknownauthors2017DJ1PARK7). It prevents the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) by degrading Maillard adducts, thus maintaining protein integrity (Unknownauthors2017DJ1PARK7).

DJ-1 is also involved in mitochondrial function, where its overexpression increases mitochondrial mass and enhances complex I activity, contributing to cellular energy homeostasis (Zhang2016Overexpression). It stabilizes the antioxidant transcriptional master regulator Nrf2, preventing its degradation and promoting the expression of detoxification enzymes like NQO1, which are crucial for cellular defense against oxidative stress (Clements2006DJ1).

In the context of neuroprotection, DJ-1 mitigates oxidative stress by eliminating hydrogen peroxide through self-oxidation, a function that is particularly important in preventing the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease (Taira2004DJ‐1). DJ-1's activity is observed in the cytoplasm, mitochondria, and nucleus, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular protection and homeostasis (Kahle2009DJ1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PARK7 gene, which encodes the DJ-1 protein, are associated with early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). These mutations can lead to a loss of function in DJ-1, contributing to the pathogenesis of PD by impairing its role in oxidative stress response and mitochondrial function (Skou2024Pathogenesis). Specific mutations, such as L166P, destabilize the DJ-1 dimer, rendering it inactive and leading to increased oxidative stress and neuronal death (Skou2024Pathogenesis). 

DJ-1 is also involved in the degradation of α-synuclein through chaperone-mediated autophagy. Mutations or deficiencies in DJ-1 can result in the accumulation of α-synuclein, a hallmark of PD, due to impaired degradation processes (Skou2024Pathogenesis). 

Altered expression or interactions of DJ-1 are linked to increased neuroinflammation, as DJ-1 modulates inflammatory pathways and oxidative stress responses. Its dysfunction can lead to heightened inflammation and oxidative damage, exacerbating neurodegenerative processes (LindHolm2023PARK7DJ1; Skou2024Pathogenesis). 

Overall, the dysfunction of DJ-1 due to mutations or altered expression significantly contributes to the development and progression of Parkinson's disease (Skou2024Pathogenesis).

## Interactions
PARK7, also known as DJ-1, is involved in numerous protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It interacts with the NuRD complex, which includes proteins such as RBBP4, RBBP7, HDAC2, and MTA2, facilitating chromatin-level gene regulation and potentially contributing to metastasis-related mechanisms (Vavougios2015Computational). PARK7 also interacts with the NONO/p54nrb protein, which is involved in RNA biogenesis and DNA damage response, linking to histone deacetylation and oxidative stress responses (Vavougios2015Computational).

PARK7 forms part of the PARK7-PINK1-Parkin (PPD) E3 ligase complex, which is crucial for mitochondrial quality control. This complex can activate the NF-κB axis under stress, promoting cell death (Vavougios2015Computational). PARK7 also interacts with the androgen receptor (AR), regulated by PIAS2, and is involved in AR-effected transcriptional activation (Vavougios2015Computational).

In the context of autophagy, PARK7 interacts with the N-terminally arginylated form of the molecular chaperone HSPA5 (R-HSPA5) and the autophagic receptor SQSTM1, forming a complex that is crucial for the targeting of ubiquitinated proteins to autophagic vacuoles (Lee2018PARK7). This interaction is essential for the autophagic removal of misfolded protein cargoes, particularly under oxidative stress conditions (Lee2018PARK7).
