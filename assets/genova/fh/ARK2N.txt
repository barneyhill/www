# ARK2N

## Overview
The ARK2N gene encodes the protein arkadia (RNF111) N-terminal like PKA signaling regulator 2N, which is involved in cellular signaling pathways. This protein is categorized as a signaling regulator, playing a crucial role in modulating protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathways. The ARK2N gene is implicated in various cellular processes, including the regulation of gene expression and cellular response to external stimuli. The protein's regulatory functions are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and have been linked to several physiological and pathological conditions. Understanding the precise mechanisms by which ARK2N influences PKA signaling could provide insights into its potential roles in disease states and therapeutic applications (Qiu2020aarFDC).
