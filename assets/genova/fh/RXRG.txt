# RXRG

## Overview
The RXRG gene encodes the retinoid X receptor gamma, a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that functions as a transcription factor. This receptor is integral to the regulation of gene expression by forming heterodimers with other nuclear receptors, such as retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), thereby influencing processes like cell differentiation, apoptosis, and metabolism (Brtko2020Natural; Lefebvre2010Retinoid). RXRG is predominantly expressed in muscle and brain tissues, where it plays a critical role in muscle differentiation and central nervous system development, particularly in the differentiation and myelination of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (Huang2010Retinoid; Szanto2004Retinoid; Mangelsdorf1992Characterization). Additionally, RXRG is involved in lipid metabolism, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis (Dawson2012The). Alterations in RXRG expression and function have been linked to various diseases, including familial isolated prolactinoma, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cone-rod dystrophy, and potentially schizophrenia, underscoring its clinical significance (Donato2022The; van2008RARRXR; Melo2016Wholeexome; Feng2005Structural).

## Structure
RXRG (retinoid X receptor gamma) is a nuclear receptor with a modular structure comprising three main domains: the DNA-binding domain (DBD), the ligand-binding domain (LBD), and the N-terminal A/B domain. The DBD is highly conserved and features a tertiary structure with an N-terminal β-hairpin and two amphipathic α-helices, which bind to retinoic acid response elements (RAREs) in DNA (Bourguet2015Retinoid). The LBD is structured as an 'antiparallel α-helical sandwich' with 12 helices and a short β-turn, forming a hydrophobic ligand-binding pocket involved in ligand binding, dimerization, and interaction with coactivators and corepressors (Bourguet2015Retinoid).

RXRG forms heterodimeric complexes with other nuclear receptors, such as retinoic acid receptors (RARs), to transduce retinoid signaling (Bourguet2015Retinoid). The LBD also contains the ligand-dependent activation function, AF-2, which undergoes a conformational change upon ligand binding, known as the mousetrap mechanism (Bourguet2015Retinoid). The N-terminal A/B domain is intrinsically disordered, allowing for flexibility and post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can impact its interaction with coregulators (Bourguet2015Retinoid). RXRG has two major isoforms, γ1 and γ2, which differ in their N-terminal regions (Bourguet2015Retinoid).

## Function
RXRG (retinoid X receptor gamma) is a nuclear receptor that plays a significant role in various molecular processes within healthy human cells. It primarily functions by forming heterodimers with other nuclear receptors, such as retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), to regulate gene expression. This regulation is crucial for processes like cell differentiation, apoptosis, and metabolism (Brtko2020Natural; Lefebvre2010Retinoid).

RXRG is predominantly expressed in muscle and brain tissues, suggesting its involvement in muscle and central nervous system differentiation (Szanto2004Retinoid; Mangelsdorf1992Characterization). In the central nervous system, RXRG is essential for the differentiation and myelination of oligodendrocyte precursor cells, which are vital for forming myelin sheaths around neurons. This process is crucial for maintaining healthy neural function (Huang2010Retinoid).

RXRG is also involved in lipid metabolism, as indicated by its expression in tissues associated with metabolic processes. It influences the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism, contributing to the regulation of lipid levels in the body (Dawson2012The). RXRG's activity in these pathways underscores its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RXRG gene have been implicated in several diseases. In familial isolated prolactinoma, a mutation in RXRG (p.R317H) has been identified, which leads to significant structural abnormalities and is predicted to deleteriously affect protein function. This mutation is located in the RXRG-Retinoic acid binding site, a region that is highly conserved, suggesting its potential clinical significance in prolactinoma (Melo2016Wholeexome).

In the context of neurological diseases, RXRG expression is altered in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), with lower levels observed in patients. This alteration in expression is part of a broader dysregulation of retinoid signaling pathways, which are crucial for motoneuron survival (van2008RARRXR). Additionally, RXRG has been associated with cone-rod dystrophy (CORD), where a splicing variant c.875+6A>G may affect cone differentiation and color perception, indicating its role in retinal diseases (Donato2022The).

In psychiatric conditions, a missense variant V59L in RXRG was identified in a patient with schizophrenia, although it was not found in healthy controls. However, structural changes in RXRG are not considered a major factor in the etiology of schizophrenia (Feng2005Structural).
