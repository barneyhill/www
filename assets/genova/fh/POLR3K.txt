# POLR3K

## Overview
The POLR3K gene encodes the RNA polymerase III subunit K, a critical component of the RNA polymerase III enzyme complex, which is responsible for the transcription of small non-coding RNAs, including tRNA and 5S rRNA. These RNAs are essential for protein synthesis and various cellular functions in eukaryotic cells. The POLR3K protein plays a significant role in maintaining the stability and function of the RNA polymerase III complex through its interactions with other subunits, such as POLR3B. Mutations in POLR3K, such as the c.121C>T/p.Arg41Trp mutation, can disrupt these interactions, leading to decreased expression of certain RNAs and contributing to neurological disorders like hypomyelinating leukodystrophy. This highlights the importance of POLR3K in gene expression regulation and cellular homeostasis (Dorboz2018Mutation).

## Structure
The POLR3K gene encodes a subunit of RNA polymerase III, which is involved in the transcription of small non-coding RNAs. The primary structure of the POLR3K protein includes a sequence where a critical mutation, c.121C>T/p.Arg41Trp, has been identified. This mutation results in the substitution of a positively charged arginine with a neutral and hydrophobic tryptophan, affecting the protein's stability and interactions (Dorboz2018Mutation).

In terms of secondary structure, the mutation alters the motifs of the wild-type protein, specifically transforming the loop (34-55), α-helix (56-59), and loop (60-63) into a unique loop (34-63) in the mutated protein. This structural change impacts the stability of the protein by modifying interactions between key residues such as Tyr43, Asn40, and Lys42 (Dorboz2018Mutation).

The tertiary structure of POLR3K is crucial for its interaction with other subunits of RNA polymerase III, particularly POLR3B. The mutation at residue 41 is significant for these interactions, as the N-terminal part of POLR3K interacts with the C-terminal part of POLR3B (Dorboz2018Mutation). The quaternary structure involves its assembly within the larger RNA polymerase III complex, although specific details on this aspect are not provided in the context.

## Function
POLR3K encodes a subunit of RNA polymerase III (Pol III), an enzyme complex responsible for the transcription of small non-coding RNAs, such as tRNA and 5S rRNA, which are essential for protein synthesis and cellular function in eukaryotic cells (Dorboz2018Mutation). In healthy human cells, POLR3K is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the regulation of gene expression and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis (Dorboz2018Mutation). 

The POLR3K subunit is involved in the transcription of small untranslated RNAs, which play crucial roles in various cellular processes, including transcription regulation, RNA processing, and translation (Dorboz2018Mutation). The interaction of POLR3K with other subunits of Pol III, such as POLR3B, is vital for the stability and function of the polymerase complex. This interaction is necessary for the proper expression of RNA polymerase III-transcribed RNAs, including 5S rRNA and 7SL RNA, which are important for normal cellular function and ribosomal RNA production (Dorboz2018Mutation). The regulation of these RNAs is crucial for maintaining the integrity of white matter and the cerebellum, highlighting the importance of POLR3K in neurological health (Dorboz2018Mutation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the POLR3K gene are associated with hypomyelinating leukodystrophy, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive ataxia, spasticity, dyskinesia, and cognitive impairments. Patients with these mutations often exhibit MRI findings of diffuse hypomyelination of the white matter, atrophy of the corpus callosum and cerebellum, and changes in brain metabolites. The specific mutation c.121C>T/p.Arg41Trp in POLR3K affects the stability of the POLR3K protein and its interactions with POLR3B, leading to decreased expression of certain RNA polymerase III-transcribed RNAs, such as 5S rRNA and 7SL RNA, in patient fibroblasts. This disruption in RNA regulation is believed to contribute to the neurological symptoms observed in affected individuals (Dorboz2018Mutation).

The study of POLR3K mutations highlights the gene's role in the regulation of ribosomal RNA, which is crucial for the development and maintenance of white matter and the cerebellum. The mutation's impact on RNA polymerase III function underscores the importance of this enzyme in cellular processes and its potential involvement in the pathology of leukodystrophies (Dorboz2018Mutation).

## Interactions
POLR3K, a subunit of RNA polymerase III, plays a crucial role in the transcription of small non-coding RNAs, including tRNA and 5S rRNA. It is involved in forming the RNA polymerase III complex by interacting with other subunits, such as POLR3B. The interaction between POLR3K and POLR3B is essential for the stability and function of the polymerase complex. A specific mutation in POLR3K, c.121C>T/p.Arg41Trp, has been shown to impair this interaction, leading to decreased expression of 5S and 7S ribosomal RNAs, which are vital for transcription regulation and translation (Dorboz2018Mutation).

The mutation alters the structural motifs of POLR3K, affecting its ability to interact with POLR3B, which in turn impacts the stability of the protein complex. This disruption in protein-protein interaction is linked to the development of hypomyelinating leukodystrophy, characterized by abnormal white matter in the brain (Dorboz2018Mutation). The impaired interaction between POLR3K and POLR3B highlights the importance of these subunits in maintaining normal cellular functions and underscores the role of POLR3K in the broader context of RNA polymerase III activity and its associated regulatory mechanisms.
