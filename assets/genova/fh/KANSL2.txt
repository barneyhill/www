# KANSL2

## Overview
KANSL2 is a gene that encodes the protein KAT8 regulatory NSL complex subunit 2, which is a critical component of the Non-Specific Lethal (NSL) complex. This protein plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation and chromatin organization by facilitating the acetylation of histone H4, a modification essential for transcription initiation (Radzisheuskaya2021Complexdependent). As part of the NSL complex, KAT8 regulatory NSL complex subunit 2 is involved in the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to transcription start sites, thereby influencing the expression of a wide array of genes, particularly those involved in housekeeping functions (Dias2014Structural). The protein interacts with other components of the NSL complex, such as WDR5, through specific structural motifs, underscoring its role in the assembly and chromatin targeting of the complex (Dias2014Structural). This interaction is crucial for the NSL complex's involvement in various cellular processes, including stress responses and DNA repair, highlighting the importance of KANSL2 in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Sheikh2019The).

## Function
KANSL2, a component of the NSL (Non-Specific Lethal) complex, plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation and chromatin organization in healthy human cells. It is involved in the acetylation of histone H4, specifically at lysines 5 and 8, which are essential for transcription initiation at gene promoters (Radzisheuskaya2021Complexdependent). The NSL complex, including KANSL2, is associated with transcription start sites and is crucial for the recruitment of RNA polymerase II, facilitating the expression of a wide array of genes, particularly housekeeping genes (Dias2014Structural).

KANSL2 interacts with WDR5, a key component required for the efficient assembly and chromatin targeting of the NSL complex. This interaction is mediated through specific residues in KANSL2, which bind to a hydrophobic cavity in WDR5, highlighting its structural role in the complex (Dias2014Structural). The NSL complex, through its interaction with chromatin remodelers and transcription factors, coordinates gene activation and is involved in various cellular processes, including stress responses and DNA repair (Sheikh2019The). KANSL2's activity in the nucleus underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating essential gene expression (Sheikh2019The).

## Interactions
KANSL2, a component of the NSL complex, interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in chromatin targeting and transcription regulation. Within the NSL complex, KANSL2 interacts with WDR5 through its C-terminal region, specifically residues 406-417. This interaction involves hydrophobic residues that fit into a hydrophobic cavity in WDR5, stabilized by hydrogen bonds with specific WDR5 residues (Dias2014Structural). The interaction between KANSL2 and WDR5 is essential for the assembly and chromatin targeting of the NSL complex, which also includes KANSL1 and KANSL3 (Dias2014Structural).

KANSL2 is also involved in interactions with other NSL complex members, such as MCRS1, suggesting a stabilizing role rather than an essential one for complex stability (Dias2014Structural). The NSL complex, including KANSL2, is implicated in mitochondrial and nuclear functions, with potential links to Parkinson's disease through interactions with PD-associated genes (Kelly2023Proteina). The NSL complex's role in gene expression and cell survival is highlighted by the fact that depletion of KANSL2 leads to decreased protein levels of other NSL complex members, indicating its importance for complex integrity (Radzisheuskaya2021Complexdependent).
