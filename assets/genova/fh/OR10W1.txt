# OR10W1

## Overview
The OR10W1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 10 subfamily W member 1, which is part of the olfactory receptor family. These receptors are a subset of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the sense of smell. The protein encoded by OR10W1 is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure, typical of GPCRs, which allows it to interact with odorant molecules and initiate a signal transduction pathway leading to olfactory perception. While primarily associated with olfactory function, recent studies have suggested that OR10W1 may also have implications in various clinical contexts, including cancer and metabolic disorders, highlighting its potential significance beyond olfaction (Kato2018P6281Identification; Yang2019Prognostic).

## Clinical Significance
The OR10W1 gene has been implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly in relation to bladder cancer and metabolic syndrome. In bladder cancer, the methylation level of OR10W1 is part of a risk model used for prognostic assessment. The study by Yang et al. found that differential methylation of OR10W1, among other genes, correlates with patient prognosis, suggesting its potential role as a biomarker for bladder cancer. This indicates that alterations in the methylation status of OR10W1 could be significant in cancer pathogenesis and prognosis (Yang2019Prognostic).

In the context of metabolic syndrome, an exome-wide association study identified a significant association between a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in OR10W1 and metabolic syndrome in a Japanese population. The SNP, located at chromosome 11: 58267125, showed a P-value of 9.91 × 10^-15 and an odds ratio of 0.85, indicating a potential protective effect against metabolic syndrome. This suggests that genetic variations in OR10W1 may influence susceptibility to metabolic syndrome (Kato2018P6281Identification).

These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of OR10W1 in disease contexts, although further research is needed to fully understand its role and implications.
