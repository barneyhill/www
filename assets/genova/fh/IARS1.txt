# IARS1

## Overview
IARS1 (isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase 1) is a gene that encodes a cytoplasmic enzyme crucial for protein synthesis, specifically responsible for the aminoacylation of tRNA with the amino acid isoleucine. This enzyme belongs to the class of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which play a pivotal role in translating genetic information into functional proteins by ensuring the correct incorporation of amino acids into polypeptide chains. Beyond its canonical role in translation, the IARS1 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including DNA repair and protein stability, through its interaction with other proteins such as the BRCA1-BARD1 complex. These interactions are mediated by its unique UBX domains, which help protect proteins from degradation. Mutations in the IARS1 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, including growth retardation and intellectual disabilities, highlighting its significance in human health and development (Chung2022Regulation; Watanabe2023Molecular; Kopajtich2016Biallelic).

## Structure
The IARS1 protein, a vertebrate cytoplasmic isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, is part of the multi-synthetase complex (MSC) and features a unique UNE-I domain composed of tandem ubiquitin regulatory X (UBX) domains. These UBX domains are crucial for protein-protein interactions, particularly with the glutamyl-tRNA synthetase 1 (EARS1) and the BRCA1-BARD1 complex, where they help protect proteins from degradation (Chung2022Regulation). The C-terminal domain of IARS1 contains three β-grasp domains, with the second and third resembling ubiquitin or the UBX domain, termed UBX1 and UBX2. These domains are connected by extended loops, forming a structure with dimensions of 30 × 52 × 25 Å, arranged in an antiparallel orientation to create a groove for protein interactions (Chung2022Regulation).

The IARS1 protein interacts with EARS1 through two main interfaces involving hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions, highlighting the importance of the EARS1 hairpin loop in complex formation (Chung2022Regulation). The structural analysis of the IARS1-EARS1 complex was achieved at a resolution of 2.4 Å, providing insights into the protein's domain interactions (Chung2022Regulation). While specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of IARS1 are not provided, the protein's role in maintaining BRCA1 stability and its involvement in DNA repair processes are emphasized (Chung2022Regulation).

## Function
IARS1 (isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase 1) is a crucial enzyme in protein synthesis, responsible for catalyzing the attachment of isoleucine to its corresponding tRNA, a process known as aminoacylation. This activity is essential for the accurate translation of genetic information into proteins, ensuring the proper incorporation of isoleucine into polypeptide chains, which is vital for cellular function and organismal development (Watanabe2023Molecular).

Beyond its role in protein synthesis, IARS1 has evolved to perform additional non-translational functions. It contains tandem UBX domains that interact with other proteins, such as BRCA1, to regulate their stability by inhibiting ubiquitylation. This interaction is crucial for DNA repair processes, particularly homologous recombination, as IARS1 stabilizes the BRCA1-BARD1 complex, preventing its degradation (Chung2022Regulation). IARS1 also plays a role in maintaining genomic stability and DNA repair, interacting with over 100 proteins involved in these processes (Chung2022Regulation).

IARS1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, but a small fraction localizes to the nucleus, where it interacts with BRCA1, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular processes (Chung2022Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IARS1 gene are associated with a range of clinical conditions, primarily characterized by growth retardation, intellectual disability, muscular hypotonia, and liver dysfunction. These conditions often manifest as a multisystem disorder with prenatal onset growth retardation, infantile hepatopathy, and varying degrees of neurodevelopmental disabilities (Orenstein2017Bi‐allelic; Kopajtich2016Biallelic). 

In humans, compound heterozygous mutations in IARS1 can lead to GRIDHH syndrome, which includes symptoms such as growth retardation, intellectual disability, muscular hypotonia, and infantile hepatopathy. A case study of a Chinese patient with compound heterozygous missense variations in IARS1, specifically c.701 T > C (p.L234P) and c.1555C > T (p.R519C), demonstrated recurrent liver failure and growth retardation (Zou2022Compound). 

The IARS1 gene mutations are also linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, contributing to conditions like fatty liver and hepatopathy with fibrosis and steatosis. These mutations may impair protein synthesis due to slowed translation, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction (Watanabe2023Molecular). The exact pathomechanism remains largely unknown, but it may involve complex organ-specific mechanisms beyond altered global translational performance (Kopajtich2016Biallelic).

## Interactions
IARS1, or isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase 1, is known to participate in various protein interactions, primarily through its UBX domains, which share structural similarity with ubiquitin. These domains facilitate interactions with multiple cellular proteins, protecting them from E3 ligase-mediated degradation. IARS1 interacts with the BRCA1-BARD1 complex, binding to the RING and BRCT domains of BRCA1, which prevents BRCA1 ubiquitylation and stabilizes it. This interaction is crucial for DNA repair functions and requires IARS1 to localize to the nucleus, despite its primary cytoplasmic presence (Chung2022Regulation).

IARS1 is also a component of the multi-synthetase complex (MSC), where it interacts with other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases such as EARS1, LARS1, QARS1, RARS1, and DARS1. The interaction with EARS1 is mediated by a distinct hairpin loop in the EARS1 anticodon-binding domain, which is essential for protecting neighboring proteins from degradation (Chung2022Regulation). Structural studies have shown that IARS1 binds to EARS1 through its UBX1 and UBX2 domains, involving hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions (Chung2022Regulation). These interactions highlight the role of IARS1 in maintaining protein stability and facilitating DNA repair processes.
