# KRT80

## Overview
KRT80 is a gene that encodes the protein keratin 80, a type II epithelial keratin, which is a member of the intermediate filament protein family. This protein plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of epithelial cells by forming intermediate filaments that provide mechanical support and resilience against stress. Keratin 80 is characterized by a central alpha-helical rod domain, which facilitates the formation of coiled-coil dimers, and is involved in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and structural maintenance (Liu2021Keratin; Ho2022Update). The gene is located on chromosome 12q13 and is expressed in a differentiation-dependent manner, with its expression pattern and interactions being implicated in the progression of several cancers, such as lung adenocarcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, and ovarian cancer (Huang2024KRT80; Li2018Keratin). The protein's involvement in key signaling pathways, such as the PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK pathways, underscores its potential as a therapeutic target and prognostic marker in oncology (Liu2021Keratin; Huang2024KRT80).

## Structure
Keratin 80 (KRT80) is a type II epithelial keratin protein encoded by a gene located on chromosome 12q13. It consists of 452 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 50.5 kDa (Liu2021Keratin; Lin2020Small). The primary structure of KRT80 includes a central alpha-helical rod domain, which is a characteristic feature of intermediate filament proteins, flanked by non-helical head and tail domains (Ho2022Update). The alpha-helix is organized in a heptad pattern, facilitating the formation of coiled-coil dimers, which can be either homodimeric or heterodimeric (Ho2022Update).

The tertiary structure involves the assembly of these dimers into antiparallel tetramers, which serve as the basic building blocks for higher-order filamentous structures (Ho2022Update). The quaternary structure of KRT80, like other keratins, involves the formation of intermediate filaments through the alignment of these tetramers, stabilized by hydrophobic interactions between heterodimers (Ho2022Update).

Post-translational modifications of KRT80 may include phosphorylation and glycosylation, which are common in keratin proteins, although specific modifications for KRT80 are not detailed in the provided context. The protein's structure and modifications contribute to its role in maintaining the structural integrity of epithelial cells.

## Function
Keratin 80 (KRT80) is a type II epithelial keratin protein that plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity of epithelial cells. It is involved in cell differentiation and is expressed in a differentiation-dependent manner. During the early stages of differentiation, KRT80 is located near the desmosomal plaques, and in terminally differentiated cells, it is dispersed throughout the cytoplasm (Liu2021Keratin). KRT80 is structurally similar to type II hair keratins, which suggests its involvement in maintaining cellular structure and function in healthy human cells (Liu2021Keratin).

KRT80 is part of the intermediate filament cytoskeletal proteins, which are crucial for the structural integrity of epithelial cells. These proteins contribute to cellular resilience against mechanical stress and are active in the cytoplasm, where they form intermediate filaments (Liu2021Keratin). The evolutionary history of KRT80 indicates that it is closely related to ancient intermediate filament proteins, suggesting its fundamental role in the formation of the embryonic epithelium in the Animalia Kingdom (Ho2022Update). The tissue-specific expression of KRT80 highlights its importance in maintaining the structural integrity and function of epithelial cells in healthy human tissues (Liu2021Keratin).

## Clinical Significance
KRT80 is implicated in several cancers, including ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer (CRC), and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In ovarian cancer, KRT80 expression is significantly higher in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, and its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis. It promotes tumor progression by enhancing cell proliferation and facilitating the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase of the cell cycle. KRT80 also influences the expression of BCL2, CyclinD1, and BAX, supporting cell survival and proliferation (Liu2021Keratin). In CRC, KRT80 is upregulated and associated with higher rates of metastasis and advanced pathological stages. Its knockdown reduces cell viability and proliferation, indicating its role in CRC progression through cell cycle regulation (Lin2020Small). In LUAD, KRT80 is overexpressed and linked to worse prognosis. It interacts with valosin-containing protein (VCP), affecting the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is crucial for cancer progression (Huang2024KRT80). These findings suggest that KRT80 could serve as a potential therapeutic target and prognostic marker in these cancers.

## Interactions
KRT80 (keratin 80) is involved in several protein interactions that play a significant role in cancer progression. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), KRT80 interacts with valosin-containing protein (VCP), which stabilizes KRT80 by preventing its degradation. This interaction is crucial for the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, a key signaling pathway in cancer progression (Huang2024KRT80). 

In colorectal carcinoma (CRC), KRT80 interacts with Protein Kinase, DNA-Activated, Catalytic Polypeptide (PRKDC), facilitating the activation of the AKT pathway. This interaction promotes cell migration and invasion, processes essential for tumor metastasis (Li2018Keratin). 

In ovarian cancer, KRT80 is regulated by the transcription factor ETS1, which is targeted by miR-206. This regulatory network influences KRT80 expression and its role in activating the MEK/ERK signaling pathway, contributing to cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (Liu2021Keratin). 

In breast cancer, KRT80 is associated with cytoskeletal changes that enhance cell invasion. It interacts with actin fibers to promote lamellipodia formation, crucial for cell migration. This interaction is linked to the upregulation of genes involved in actin rearrangements, such as cortactin (CTTN) and SEPT9 (Perone2019SREBP1).
