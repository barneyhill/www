# ME3

## Overview
The ME3 gene encodes the mitochondrial enzyme malic enzyme 3, which is a NADP+-dependent enzyme involved in the conversion of malate to pyruvate. This enzyme plays a critical role in cellular metabolism, particularly in energy regulation, redox homeostasis, and biosynthetic pathways such as lipid biosynthesis and oxidative stress regulation (Grell2022Structures). Structurally, ME3 is characterized by a tetrameric assembly, with each monomeric subunit contributing to its stable configuration (Grell2022Structures). Unlike other enzymes, ME3 is non-allosteric and does not require modulators for its activity, although it possesses a putative allosteric binding site (Grell2022Structures). Functionally, ME3 is significant in pancreatic β-cells for insulin secretion and has been implicated in the progression of pancreatic cancer, where its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis (Hasan2015Mitochondrial; Zhang2019Effects). The enzyme's involvement in the TGF-β/Smad2/3 signaling pathway suggests its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Zhang2019Effects).

## Structure
The human Malic Enzyme 3 (ME3) is a mitochondrial NADP+-dependent enzyme that plays a role in the conversion of malate to pyruvate. The primary structure of ME3 consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the ME3 gene, with each monomeric subunit containing residues 23/24-584 (Grell2022Structures). The secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, with Domain A being predominantly helical (Hsieh2014Structural).

The tertiary structure of ME3 is organized into four domains, similar to ME1 and ME2. Domain C is crucial for ME3's activity, exhibiting a modified dinucleotide-binding Rossmann fold, which is involved in NADP+ binding (Grell2022Structures; Hsieh2014Structural). The quaternary structure of ME3 forms a stable tetrameric complex, with a molecular weight of approximately 248 kDa (Grell2022Structures). This tetrameric assembly is characterized by a tightly packed dimeric interface, stabilized by hydrophobic and ionic interactions (Grell2022Structures).

ME3 does not require modulators for its activity and is not allosterically regulated, although it preserves a putative allosteric binding site (Grell2022Structures). The enzyme's structure is inherently stable, with no significant changes upon citrate binding (Grell2022Structures).

## Function
Malic enzyme 3 (ME3) is a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a significant role in cellular metabolism by catalyzing the conversion of (S)-malate to pyruvate, a reaction that produces NADPH and CO2. This process is crucial for cellular energy regulation, redox homeostasis, and biosynthetic pathways, particularly in lipid biosynthesis and the regulation of oxidative stress (Grell2022Structures). ME3 is a non-allosteric enzyme, meaning it does not require modulators for its activity, and it functions as a stable tetramer in the mitochondria (Grell2022Structures).

In pancreatic β-cells, ME3 is important for insulin secretion. Studies have shown that knockdown of ME3 significantly inhibits insulin release in response to glucose and other secretagogues, suggesting its critical role in maintaining normal insulin secretion (Hasan2015Mitochondrial). Despite its low enzymatic activity in these cells, ME3's presence is necessary for proper insulin release, indicating that its function may extend beyond its catalytic activity (Hasan2015Mitochondrial). The enzyme's activity in the mitochondria contributes to energy production and metabolic homeostasis, highlighting its importance in cellular and organismal physiology.

## Clinical Significance
Malic enzyme 3 (ME3) has been implicated in the progression of pancreatic cancer due to its overexpression in cancerous tissues compared to non-tumor tissues. Elevated levels of ME3 are associated with shorter patient survival, with high ME3 expression correlating with a median survival of 308 days versus 430 days for those with lower expression levels (Zhang2019Effects). ME3 promotes the proliferation, migration, and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells, potentially through the regulation of the TGF-β/Smad2/3 signaling pathway, which is crucial for epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis (Zhang2019Effects). EMT is a key process in cancer metastasis, and ME3's role in this process suggests it could be a target for therapeutic intervention.

The study by Zhang et al. demonstrated that silencing ME3 in pancreatic cancer cell lines reduced cell activity, while overexpression increased it. ME3 knockdown decreased CDC20 protein levels, whereas overexpression increased them, indicating ME3's involvement in cell cycle regulation (Zhang2019Effects). These findings suggest that ME3 could serve as a potential biomarker for pancreatic cancer prognosis and a target for therapeutic strategies aimed at suppressing tumor growth and metastasis (Zhang2019Effects).
