# GPHN

## Overview
The GPHN gene encodes the protein gephyrin, a multifunctional scaffolding protein that plays a pivotal role in the central nervous system by organizing inhibitory synapses. Gephyrin is essential for the clustering and anchoring of inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors, such as glycine receptors (GlyRs) and GABA_A receptors, at the postsynaptic membrane, thereby influencing synaptic transmission and plasticity (Bai2020Gephyrinmediated). Structurally, gephyrin is characterized by an N-terminal G-domain and a C-terminal E-domain, which facilitate its interactions with various synaptic proteins and cytoskeletal elements (Kim2006Deciphering; Kasaragod2018Structure–Function). Beyond its neuronal functions, gephyrin is also involved in the biosynthesis of the molybdenum cofactor in non-neuronal tissues, underscoring its diverse biological roles (Nawrotzki2012Expression). Mutations in the GPHN gene have been linked to several neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorders and epilepsy, highlighting its clinical significance (Pizzarelli2020Tuning; Lionel2013Rare).

## Structure
Gephyrin, encoded by the GPHN gene, is a multifunctional protein with a complex molecular structure. It consists of an N-terminal G-domain and a C-terminal E-domain, connected by a flexible linker region. The G-domain forms a trimer with a Rossmann fold architecture, while the E-domain forms a dimer and can be subdivided into four subdomains (Kim2006Deciphering; Kasaragod2018Structure–Function). The full-length gephyrin protein is proposed to form a planar hexagonal scaffold, which is crucial for its role in synaptic organization (Kasaragod2018Structure–Function).

The linker region is highly unstructured and contains multiple sites for post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as phosphorylation, palmitoylation, acetylation, SUMOylation, and nitrosylation. These modifications influence gephyrin's structure and function, affecting its clustering and synapse formation (Kasaragod2018Structure–Function). Alternative splicing of the GPHN gene results in variations in the primary sequence, particularly affecting the linker region, which in turn influences gephyrin's clustering behavior and oligomeric state (Kasaragod2018Structure–Function).

Gephyrin's E-domain interacts with the intracellular loop of receptors like GlyR and GABA A Rs, with specific hydrophobic interactions being crucial for binding (Kim2006Deciphering). The protein's ability to form networks and undergo conformational transitions is important for dynamic receptor movement and synaptic plasticity (Sola2004Structural).

## Function
Gephyrin, encoded by the GPHN gene, is a multifunctional protein that plays a critical role in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells. In neurons, gephyrin acts as a scaffolding protein essential for the clustering and anchoring of inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors, such as glycine receptors (GlyRs) and GABA_A receptors, at the postsynaptic membrane. This localization is crucial for synaptic transmission and plasticity, influencing neuronal excitability and network stability (Bai2020Gephyrinmediated). Gephyrin facilitates the formation of inhibitory postsynaptic density sheets through phase separation, a process driven by multivalent interactions with receptor subunits (Bai2020Gephyrinmediated).

In non-neuronal tissues, gephyrin is involved in the biosynthesis of the molybdenum cofactor (MoCo), a prosthetic group necessary for the activity of molybdoenzymes such as sulfite oxidase and xanthine oxidase. In the liver, gephyrin is primarily found as a C3-containing splice variant and is part of a 600 kDa protein complex in the cytoplasm, indicating its metabolic functions are exerted there (Nawrotzki2012Expression). The protein's structure is similar to those involved in MoCo biosynthesis in other organisms, suggesting its role in catalyzing the final step of this process (Nawrotzki2012Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GPHN gene, which encodes the gephyrin protein, are implicated in several neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. Hemizygous microdeletions at chromosome 14q23, affecting GPHN exons, have been identified in patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), schizophrenia, and temporal lobe epilepsy. These deletions can impair gephyrin oligomerization and disrupt GABAergic synapse formation, leading to altered synaptic inhibition (Pizzarelli2020Tuning; Lionel2013Rare).

A specific missense mutation, G375D, in the GPHN gene is associated with a form of epileptic encephalopathy similar to Dravet's syndrome. This mutation affects gephyrin's binding affinity to GABA A and glycine receptors, reducing postsynaptic clustering and GABAergic inhibition, which contributes to seizures and abnormal neurodevelopment (Dejanovic2015Simultaneous).

In Alzheimer's disease, gephyrin dysfunction is linked to abnormal accumulation with β-amyloid plaques, altering GABAergic transmission. Gephyrin levels show biphasic alterations in Alzheimer's disease mouse models, with increased expression before plaque formation and decreased levels in later stages (Pizzarelli2020Tuning).

GPHN is also identified as a genetic risk locus for schizophrenia, with functional connections to other risk genes, highlighting its critical role in synaptic plasticity and involvement in various neurological disorders (Pizzarelli2020Tuning; Lionel2013Rare).

## Interactions
Gephyrin (GPHN) is a key scaffolding protein that interacts with various proteins to organize inhibitory synapses. It directly binds to glycine receptors (GlyRs) and GABA_A receptors (GABA_A Rs), anchoring them to the postsynaptic membrane. The interaction with GlyRs is mediated by the E-domain of gephyrin, which binds to an 18 amino acid motif within the GlyR β subunit, crucial for receptor clustering (Groeneweg2018Gephyrin:; Kim2006Deciphering). Gephyrin's interaction with GABA_A Rs is weaker, requiring additional proteins for effective clustering (Groeneweg2018Gephyrin:).

Gephyrin also interacts with cytoskeletal elements, including microtubules and actin filaments, through proteins like profilin and members of the Mena/VASP family, which stabilize actin in dendritic spines (Groeneweg2018Gephyrin:; Kasaragod2018Structure–Function). It serves as a cargo protein for the motor protein KIF5, facilitating GlyR recruitment to the synaptic membrane, and interacts with dynein light chains (DLC1 and DLC2) for cargo transport (Kasaragod2018Structure–Function).

Gephyrin forms complexes with neuroligin 2 (NL2) and collybistin (CB), which are essential for targeting GABA_A Rs and gephyrin to the postsynaptic membrane (Kasaragod2018Structure–Function). It also interacts with IQSEC3, potentially influencing synaptic organization (Kasaragod2018Structure–Function). These interactions highlight gephyrin's central role in synaptic organization and receptor clustering.
