# KANK2

## Overview
KANK2 is a gene that encodes the protein KN motif and ankyrin repeat domains 2, which plays a significant role in cellular structure and function. This protein is categorized as a cytoskeletal-associated protein due to its involvement in linking integrin-based focal adhesions to microtubules, thereby facilitating actin-microtubule crosstalk essential for cell migration and adhesion. The protein contains several distinct domains, including a KN motif, a coiled-coil domain, and ankyrin repeat domains, which enable interactions with other proteins such as talin, liprin-β1, and KIF21A. These interactions are crucial for maintaining cellular dynamics and stability. KANK2 is implicated in various physiological processes, including cytoskeletal organization and cellular signaling pathways, and its dysregulation is associated with clinical conditions such as progressive supranuclear palsy and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (Xu2021Nephroticsyndromeassociated; Paradžik2020KANK2; Lončarić2023Talin2).

## Structure
KANK2 is a protein characterized by several distinct domains, including a KN motif, a coiled-coil domain, and an ankyrin repeat domain (ANKRD). The KN domain is involved in binding to talin, while the coiled-coil domain interacts with liprin-β1, and the ANKRD is responsible for binding to KIF21A (Lončarić2023Talin2). The ANKRD domain serves as a protein-binding module, associating with KIF21A, and is located on the concave side of the α-solenoid fold (Xu2021Nephroticsyndromeassociated).

The S684F mutation in KANK2, which corresponds to S1179F in KANK1, does not significantly affect the folding of the ANKRD or its binding to KIF21A. However, it induces a gain-of-binding mutation, leading to a loss-of-function effect by allowing abnormal binding of eIF4A1 and ankyrin-G (Xu2021Nephroticsyndromeassociated). This mutation creates a hydrophobic binding spot on the ANKRD, enhancing the interaction with eIF4A1 (Xu2021Nephroticsyndromeassociated).

KANK2 is involved in cytoskeletal organization and may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions. Alternative splicing can result in different isoforms, potentially affecting its structural and functional properties. However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of KANK2 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
KANK2 is a protein that plays a crucial role in linking integrin αVβ5 focal adhesions to microtubules, which is essential for regulating cell migration and sensitivity to microtubule-targeting drugs. It is part of the cortical microtubule stabilizing complex (CMSC) and interacts with talin proteins within focal adhesions to mediate actin-microtubule crosstalk, a process vital for maintaining cellular structure and function (Lončarić2023Talin2; Paradžik2020KANK2). KANK2 localizes at the tips of microtubule fibers that overlap with focal adhesions, suggesting its role in mediating crosstalk between actin and microtubule dynamics (Paradžik2020KANK2).

In healthy human cells, KANK2 is involved in cytoskeletal organization, influencing cell shape and stability by interacting with actin filaments and microtubules. It is predominantly active in the cytoplasm and is implicated in processes like cell migration and adhesion, which are crucial for tissue development and repair (Zhu2008Kank). The protein's interaction with talin2 is particularly important for regulating microtubule dynamics, paclitaxel sensitivity, and cell migration, highlighting its role in cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular signaling pathways (Lončarić2023Talin2).

## Clinical Significance
KANK2 has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to mutations or alterations in its expression. In the context of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a neurodegenerative disease, KANK2 is identified as a potential therapeutic target. The gene is up-regulated in PSP brains, particularly in astrocytes, and its suppression via RNA interference has shown to reduce tau-mediated cell toxicity in Drosophila models, suggesting its involvement in tau-related neurodegeneration (Min2023Cross). 

KANK2 is also associated with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), a kidney disease characterized by glomerular scarring and proteinuria. Studies have identified KANK2 as a potential susceptibility gene for FSGS, with RNA interference experiments in mice showing that KANK2 disruption leads to proteinuria and podocyte foot process effacement, indicating its role in maintaining podocyte function (Yu2016A).

Additionally, KANK2 has been linked to nephrotic syndrome, a condition involving excessive protein loss in urine, and its dysregulation may contribute to cancer progression due to its role in cell migration and cytoskeletal organization (Hensley2016Evolutionary). These findings highlight the gene's significance in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
KANK2 is involved in several key interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of integrin-based adhesion and microtubule (MT) targeting. It interacts with the talin protein through its KN motif, which binds to the R7 region in the talin rod. This interaction activates talin for integrin binding and stabilizes active integrins, while also interfering with F-actin binding to the talin rod, thereby destabilizing the integrin-actomyosin linkage and affecting force transmission across integrins (Chen2018The).

KANK2 also interacts with the cortical microtubule stabilization complexes (CMSCs) by binding to liprin-β1 through its coiled-coil domain. This interaction recruits liprin-β1 to the focal adhesion (FA) belt, linking the MT targeting machinery to integrins (Chen2018The). Additionally, KANK2 recruits the kinesin-4 family member Kif21a through its C-terminal ankyrin repeats to CMSCs, which prevents unaligned MT outgrowth (Chen2018The).

In the context of integrin αVβ5 focal adhesions, KANK2 is crucial for linking these adhesions to MTs, facilitating crosstalk between actin and MT dynamics. Knockdown experiments have shown that KANK2 is essential for maintaining sensitivity to microtubule poisons and regulating cell migration (Paradžik2020KANK2).
