# SEMA3D

## Overview
SEMA3D is a gene that encodes the protein semaphorin 3D, a member of the class 3 semaphorins, which are secreted proteins known for their roles in axonal guidance, angiogenesis, and immune responses. Semaphorin 3D is characterized by a conserved sema domain, a plexin-semaphorin-integrin (PSI) domain, an immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain, and a C-terminal basic domain, which facilitate its interactions with neuropilins and plexins, acting as co-receptors (Valdembri2016Class; Worzfeld2014Semaphorins). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell migration and vascular development, and has been implicated in several pathological conditions such as cancer, Hirschsprung disease, and Crohn's disease (Wang2017Decreased; Yang2023Transcriptome; LuzónToro2013Mutational; Fard2021Semaphorins). Through its interactions with other proteins, semaphorin 3D plays a crucial role in modulating cellular signaling pathways, highlighting its significance in both normal physiological and disease contexts (Wolman2004Repulsion; Li2022Sema3d).

## Structure
SEMA3D is a member of the class 3 semaphorins, characterized by a conserved sema domain of approximately 500 amino acids, followed by a plexin-semaphorin-integrin (PSI) domain, an immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain, and a C-terminal basic domain (Valdembri2016Class; Worzfeld2014Semaphorins). The sema domain is crucial for the protein's function, mediating homodimerization and binding to plexins and neuropilins (Worzfeld2014Semaphorins). 

The molecular structure of SEMA3D involves a homodimeric form with a less hydrophobic dimer interface stabilized by disulfide bonds (Valdembri2016Class). This dimerization is essential for its interaction with plexins, forming a head-to-head interface necessary for signaling (Sun2018Role). 

SEMA3D, like other class 3 semaphorins, is a secreted protein that requires neuropilin as a co-receptor to facilitate interaction with plexins, forming a stable complex capable of signaling (Lu2021Architecture). The protein's structure and function are influenced by post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which are common in semaphorins (Valdembri2016Class). 

The specific plexin partners for SEMA3D are not fully detailed, but it is known to signal through Nrp1 and potentially other plexins (Valdembri2016Class).

## Function
SEMA3D (semaphorin 3D) is a member of the semaphorin family, which plays a crucial role in various cellular and molecular processes. In healthy human cells, SEMA3D is involved in cardiac development and angiogenesis. It acts as an anti-angiogenic signal, helping to balance stimulatory cues to prevent inappropriate vessel formation, thereby playing a regulatory role in vascular development and maintenance (Fard2021Semaphorins).

SEMA3D is also implicated in cell migration and maintaining normal tissue architecture. Its expression is significantly lower in colorectal cancer tissues compared to normal tissues, suggesting a potential role in inhibiting cell migration and possibly acting as a tumor suppressor (Wang2017Decreased). The protein interacts with receptors such as neuropilins and plexins, which are involved in signaling pathways that regulate cell functions like adhesion and cytoskeletal dynamics (Worzfeld2014Semaphorins).

While the specific function of SEMA3D in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its involvement in these processes indicates its importance in maintaining normal cellular and tissue functions, particularly in the cardiovascular and immune systems.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SEMA3D gene have been implicated in several diseases. In familial Meniere's disease, a novel missense variant in the SEMA3D gene was identified, suggesting its potential role in the disease's autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. This variant segregated with the complete Meniere's disease phenotype, indicating its possible contribution to the condition (MartínSierra2016Variable).

In Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), mutations in SEMA3D, such as E198K, have been associated with increased protein expression in the smooth muscle layer of the colon, suggesting a pathogenic effect. These mutations may impair enteric axonal projection during neural crest cell migration, contributing to the disease phenotype (LuzónToro2013Mutational).

SEMA3D expression is also relevant in glioma, where lower mRNA levels are associated with higher tumor grade and lower survival rates. Conversely, higher expression levels of SEMA3D are linked to better overall survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Valiulyte2020A).

In Crohn's disease, SEMA3D is significantly upregulated in inflamed tissues, indicating its involvement in autonomic and enteric nervous system abnormalities. This upregulation may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease (Yang2023Transcriptome).

## Interactions
SEMA3D, a member of the semaphorin family, is known to interact with various proteins, influencing multiple cellular processes. In the context of axonal guidance, SEMA3D interacts with neuropilin receptors, specifically Npn-1A and Npn-2B, to mediate both repulsive and attractive effects on axons. These interactions are crucial for the proper formation of axonal pathways in the zebrafish central nervous system, where Npn-1A is necessary for the repulsion of certain axons, and both Npn-1A and Npn-2B are required for the attraction of others (Wolman2004Repulsion).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SEMA3D interacts with filamin A (FLNA), a protein involved in cytoskeletal remodeling. This interaction is significant as it inactivates the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is implicated in cancer progression. SEMA3D's interaction with FLNA affects the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cytoskeleton remodeling, thereby restraining HCC progression (Li2022Sema3d).

In gliomas, SEMA3D shows a positive correlation with the receptor PLXNA2 and a negative correlation with NRP1, suggesting interactions that influence cancer-associated processes (Valiulyte2020A). These interactions highlight SEMA3D's role in modulating cellular signaling pathways across different biological contexts.
