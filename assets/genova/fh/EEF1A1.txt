# EEF1A1

## Overview
The EEF1A1 gene encodes the eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1 (eEF1A1), a multifunctional protein primarily involved in the elongation phase of protein synthesis. As a member of the elongation factor family, eEF1A1 facilitates the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome, a critical step in ensuring the fidelity and efficiency of protein translation (Xu2022Functions). Beyond its canonical role in translation, eEF1A1 is implicated in various cellular processes, including cytoskeleton organization, nuclear export, and interactions with multiple proteins and nucleic acids, underscoring its versatility (Khacho2008eEF1A; Liu2002Interactions). The protein's structure, characterized by specific domains for GTP binding and hydrolysis, allows it to participate in these diverse functions (Soares2009Structural). Clinically, EEF1A1 is associated with several diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, where its expression and interactions are often dysregulated, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Chen2018eEF1A1; Lei2023EEF1A1).

## Structure
The EEF1A1 gene encodes the eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1 (eEF1A1), a protein involved in the elongation phase of protein synthesis. The primary structure of eEF1A1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains for GTP binding and hydrolysis (Soares2009Structural). The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its compact, globular tertiary structure (Sánchez-Murcia2017Structural).

eEF1A1 is composed of three domains: Domain I includes residues up to Pro238, Domain II spans from Pro241 to Ser329, and Domain III begins with Met/Gln335 (Kanibolotsky2008Multiple). These domains are tightly packed, with a significant space between Domains I and II, which is important for its function in binding tRNA and other ligands (Kanibolotsky2008Multiple).

Post-translational modifications of eEF1A1 include phosphorylation and methylation, which are significant for its function and potential role in tumorigenesis (Sánchez-Murcia2017Structural). The protein also exhibits reversible fluctuations between 'open' and 'closed' conformations, which are crucial for its interaction with calmodulin and other signaling proteins (Kanibolotsky2008Multiple). The isoform eEF1A1 has a specific affinity for Ca2+-calmodulin, which is less flexible in eEF1A1, suggesting a higher affinity compared to its isoform eEF1A2 (Kanibolotsky2008Multiple).

## Function
EEF1A1 encodes the eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1 (eEF1A1), a protein that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by facilitating the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome's A-site during translation. This function is essential for the elongation phase of protein synthesis, ensuring the accurate and efficient production of proteins in cells (Xu2022Functions).

Beyond its canonical role in translation, eEF1A1 is involved in various cellular processes. It plays a significant role in cytoskeleton organization by binding to F-actin and β-actin mRNA, acting as a linker that anchors mRNA to the cytoskeleton. This interaction is vital for the localization of β-actin mRNA in cell protrusions, which is important for maintaining cell polarity and motility (Liu2002Interactions).

eEF1A1 is also implicated in the nuclear export of proteins. It interacts with the transcription-dependent nuclear export motif (TD-NEM) to facilitate the export of proteins like the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor and poly(A)-binding protein 1, operating from the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear envelope (Khacho2008eEF1A). This role is distinct from its function in translation, highlighting its versatility in cellular processes (Khacho2008eEF1A).

## Clinical Significance
The EEF1A1 gene is implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression and interactions. In cancer, EEF1A1 is frequently overexpressed, contributing to tumor progression and poor prognosis. For instance, high EEF1A1 expression is associated with unfavorable outcomes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and colon adenocarcinoma, where it serves as an independent prognostic factor for survival (Chen2018eEF1A1; Joung2019Expression). In breast cancer, low EEF1A1 mRNA expression is linked to poor prognosis in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) cases, although its protein levels are often elevated in ductal breast carcinoma (Lin2018Contradictory).

EEF1A1 is also involved in neurodegenerative disorders. Its knockdown in U251 glioma cells affects gene expression and alternative splicing, potentially impacting pathways related to Parkinson's disease (Lei2023EEF1A1). Additionally, pseudogenes of EEF1A1, such as EEF1A1P6, are linked to schizophrenia and other conditions (Cristiano2022The).

The gene's role extends to viral infections, where it interacts with viral proteins, enhancing replication and cellular transformation (Abbas2015The). These diverse roles highlight EEF1A1's significance in disease pathogenesis, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
EEF1A1, or eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1, is involved in various protein and nucleic acid interactions. It forms a specific complex with the multifunctional protein Sgt1, with the interaction occurring at a 1:1 molar ratio. This interaction is characterized by the binding of the TPR domain of Sgt1 to the D2 and D3 domains of eEF1A1, facilitated by electrostatic forces (Novosylna2015Translation). eEF1A1 also interacts with calmodulin in a Ca2+-dependent manner, which can interfere with its tRNA-binding and actin-bundling activities. This interaction suggests a regulatory role of calmodulin in modulating eEF1A1 functions (Novosylna2017Comparison).

eEF1A1 is known to bind to actin, inducing the formation of F-actin bundles, and this interaction is distinct from its oncogenic variant eEF1A2 (Novosylna2017Comparison). It also interacts with SAMHD1, a protein associated with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, through a yeast two-hybrid assay and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. This interaction may involve the turnover of SAMHD1 by targeting it for degradation via the proteasome (Morrissey2015The). These interactions highlight the multifunctional nature of eEF1A1 in cellular processes.
