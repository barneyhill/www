# DDX21

## Overview
DDX21 is a gene that encodes the protein DExD-box helicase 21, a member of the DEAD-box protein family characterized by the conserved Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD) motif. This protein functions as an RNA helicase, playing a pivotal role in ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis and processing, primarily within the nucleolus. DExD-box helicase 21 is involved in the regulation of rRNA transcription by forming ring-shaped structures around RNA polymerase I complexes, thereby modulating transcriptional activity (Xing2017SLERT). Beyond its role in transcription, DExD-box helicase 21 is integral to pre-rRNA processing and ribosome biogenesis, contributing to cellular growth and function (Linder2011From). The protein's interactions with various nucleic acids and proteins, including its ability to unwind R-loops, underscore its importance in maintaining genomic stability and cellular homeostasis (Tanaka2020DEAD-box). DDX21's dysregulation is implicated in several cancers, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Gao2023Phase; Wu2024DDX21).

## Structure
DDX21, or DExD-box helicase 21, is a protein that belongs to the DEAD-box protein family, characterized by the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD). This motif is integral to its function in RNA metabolism. The protein contains a helicase core domain, which is crucial for its ATP binding and hydrolysis activities, as well as RNA binding and unwinding capabilities. This core domain is a defining feature of the protein's molecular structure and is essential for its helicase activity.

DDX21 may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions with other proteins. The ability of DDX21 to form complexes with other proteins suggests the presence of potential quaternary structures, although specific details on these structures are not provided in the context. The formation of these complexes indicates that DDX21 may play a role in larger protein assemblies, contributing to its functional versatility in cellular processes.

The context does not provide detailed information on the primary, secondary, or tertiary structures of DDX21, nor does it mention specific domains or prominent folds beyond the helicase core domain. Information on splice variant isoforms is also not available.

## Function
DDX21, also known as DExD-box helicase 21, is an RNA helicase that plays a crucial role in the regulation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis and processing in healthy human cells. It is primarily active in the nucleolus, where it forms ring-shaped structures around RNA polymerase I (Pol I) complexes, which are essential for rRNA transcription. These DDX21 rings are involved in suppressing pre-rRNA transcription by preventing Pol I loading onto rDNA promoters, thus regulating rRNA synthesis (Xing2017SLERT).

DDX21 interacts with SLERT, a regulatory RNA, which modulates the conformation of DDX21 rings, enhancing Pol I transcription activity. This interaction is crucial for coordinating transcription and rRNA processing, thereby improving processing efficiency (Xing2017SLERT). The protein's role extends beyond transcription regulation, as it is involved in pre-rRNA processing and modification, contributing to ribosome biogenesis (Xing2017SLERT).

DDX21 also displays intrinsic ATP-independent RNA folding activity, which is important for RNA rearrangements and the formation of ribonucleoprotein complexes (Linder2011From). This multifaceted role of DDX21 in rRNA synthesis and processing underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular function and growth.

## Clinical Significance
DDX21 is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression and interactions. In colorectal cancer, DDX21 is significantly overexpressed, contributing to tumor progression and metastasis. Its overexpression is associated with poor overall survival and disease-free survival rates in advanced stages of colorectal cancer (Gao2023Phase). DDX21's role in DNA damage repair and genome instability further links it to tumorigenesis, as its high expression can lead to increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging drugs like irinotecan, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Xie2022The).

In breast cancer, DDX21 is overexpressed in up to 25% of cases, particularly in highly proliferative tissues. It is essential for tumor cell survival and proliferation, interacting with the c-Jun transcription factor to regulate AP-1 activity and promote cell proliferation markers like cyclin D1 (Zhang2014Elevated). Knockdown of DDX21 results in reduced tumorigenicity and increased cell death, highlighting its critical role in cancer cell maintenance (Zhang2014Elevated).

DDX21 is also a potential biomarker for poor prognosis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, where its elevated expression correlates with shorter overall and disease-free survival (Wu2024DDX21). These findings underscore DDX21's significance in cancer progression and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
DDX21, also known as nucleolar RNA helicase 2, is involved in several critical cellular processes through its interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It plays a significant role in ribosome biogenesis, transcription coordination, and ribosomal RNA processing. DDX21 is capable of unwinding R-loops, which are three-stranded nucleic acid complexes consisting of an RNA:DNA heteroduplex, thereby preventing R-loop-mediated stalling of RNA polymerases (Tanaka2020DEAD-box). 

While specific physical interactions of DDX21 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed in the provided excerpts, DDX21 is known to participate in the formation of ribonucleoprotein complexes. It interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, including nucleolin, fibrillarin, and rRNA, which are essential for its role in RNA processing and ribosome biogenesis. These interactions suggest that DDX21 is integral to the regulation of transcription and ribosomal RNA synthesis, although the exact mechanisms in cancer cell biology remain to be fully elucidated (Wang2022Genomic; Tanaka2020DEAD-box). 

The study by Wang et al. also highlights the identification of several interactive genes during DDX21 knockdown in colorectal cancer cells, including PTPRC, FN1, ITGAM, RAD51, TRAF6, CCNB1, FOXP3, CCNA2, HIST2H2AC, and HSPA5, suggesting potential pathways and interactions that may be influenced by DDX21 activity (Wang2022Genomic).
