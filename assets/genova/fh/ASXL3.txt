# ASXL3

## Overview
The ASXL3 gene encodes the ASXL transcriptional regulator 3, a protein that plays a pivotal role in chromatin modification and transcriptional regulation. As a member of the ASXL family, ASXL3 is characterized by its involvement in epigenetic regulation, primarily through its participation in the Polycomb repressive deubiquitination (PR-DUB) complex. This protein is integral to the regulation of histone modifications, particularly the deubiquitination of histone H2A, which is crucial for maintaining proper gene expression. ASXL3 is highly expressed in the cerebral cortex and other tissues, underscoring its significance in neurodevelopmental processes. Mutations in the ASXL3 gene are linked to Bainbridge-Ropers Syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder marked by severe developmental delays and distinctive craniofacial features. The protein's interactions with various chromatin-associated complexes highlight its essential role in both normal cellular functions and disease states (Kuechler2016Bainbridge–Ropers; Srivastava2015De; Szczepanski2020ASXL3).

## Structure
The ASXL3 protein is a member of the ASXL family, characterized by a conserved domain structure. It consists of 2,248 amino acids and includes several key domains: the ASXN domain at the N-terminus, the ASXH domain, ASXM1 and ASXM2 domains in the middle region, and a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger at the C-terminus (Wayhelova2019Novel; Katoh2013Functional). The ASXN domain is structurally similar to the Forkhead-box (FOX) domain, which is involved in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation (Katoh2013Functional). The ASXH domain facilitates protein-protein interactions with epigenetic regulators like BAP1 and KDM1A (Katoh2013Functional). The ASXM1 and ASXM2 domains are also involved in protein-protein interactions, associating with nuclear hormone receptors and their cofactors (Katoh2013Functional). The PHD domain is a histone or DNA-binding module, although its specific targets in ASXL3 are not yet identified (Katoh2013Functional).

ASXL3 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and poly-ubiquitination at K350, which may affect its interaction with BAP1 (Srivastava2015De). Truncating variants in ASXL3, such as those found in Bainbridge-Ropers syndrome, can lead to nonsense-mediated decay of mRNA, reducing the expression of the full-length protein (Srivastava2015De).

## Function
The ASXL3 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in chromatin modification and transcription regulation. It functions as an epigenetic regulator, controlling gene expression through chromatin remodeling. The ASXL3 protein contains several domains, including ASXN, ASXH, ASXM1, ASXM2, and PHD, which facilitate interactions with various protein complexes and recognize chromatin histone post-translational modifications (Srivastava2015De; Katoh2013Functional). 

In healthy cells, ASXL3 is involved in the regulation of histone ubiquitination, specifically the deubiquitination of histone H2A at lysine 119 (H2AK119Ub1), as part of the Polycomb repressive deubiquitination (PR-DUB) complex with BAP1. This interaction is essential for maintaining proper levels of histone modifications, which are critical for gene expression regulation (Srivastava2015De). 

ASXL3 is highly expressed in the cerebral cortex and other tissues, indicating its role in neurodevelopmental processes. It is involved in maintaining homeotic gene activation and silencing, similar to its Drosophila ortholog, the Asx gene, which is crucial for the regulation of developmentally important genes, such as the HOX genes (Bainbridge2013De; Schirwani2021Expanding).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ASXL3 gene are primarily associated with Bainbridge-Ropers Syndrome (BRS), a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by severe developmental delay, intellectual disability, hypotonia, feeding difficulties, and distinctive craniofacial features. These features often include down-slanting palpebral fissures, hypertelorism, a tubular nose with a prominent nasal bridge, and a low-hanging columella (Kuechler2016Bainbridge–Ropers; Schirwani2021Expanding). BRS is caused by de novo truncating mutations in ASXL3, which lead to loss-of-function variants that disrupt normal gene function (Kuechler2016Bainbridge–Ropers; Srivastava2015De).

The ASXL3 gene plays a role in the Polycomb repressive deubiquitination (PR-DUB) complex, which is involved in chromatin remodeling. Mutations in ASXL3 result in epigenetic dysregulation, contributing to the pathophysiology of BRS (Srivastava2015De). In addition to BRS, missense mutations in ASXL3 have been identified in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), suggesting a broader impact on neurodevelopmental conditions (Srivastava2015De).

The clinical presentation of BRS includes profound speech delays, significant motor milestone delays, and frequent drooling, with most patients having absent speech or speaking only single words (Kuechler2016Bainbridge–Ropers). The syndrome also shows phenotypic overlap with Bohring-Opitz syndrome, although it is distinct in its clinical manifestations (Balasubramanian2017Delineating).

## Interactions
ASXL3 is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in chromatin modification and transcriptional regulation. It interacts with BAP1, a ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase, forming the Polycomb repressive deubiquitination (PR-DUB) complex. This complex is responsible for removing mono-ubiquitin from lysine 119 of histone H2A (H2AK119Ub1), a process essential for transcriptional regulation (Srivastava2015De). ASXL3 also interacts with BRD4, a bromodomain-containing protein, through a specific BRD4 binding motif (BBM) within ASXL3. This interaction is critical for maintaining BRD4's chromatin occupancy at active enhancers, influencing gene expression in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) (Szczepanski2020ASXL3).

ASXL3 serves as a bridge between BRD4 and the BAP1 complex, facilitating chromatin recruitment and transcriptional activation (Szczepanski2020ASXL3). It also interacts with other proteins such as EZH2 and SUZ12, components of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), and LSD1, a histone demethylase, highlighting its role in regulating gene expression and maintaining pluripotency (Shukla2017ASXL3). These interactions underscore ASXL3's significance in both normal cellular processes and disease states like Bainbridge-Ropers syndrome and SCLC.
