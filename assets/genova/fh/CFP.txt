# CFP

## Overview
The CFP gene encodes complement factor properdin, a pivotal component of the immune system's alternative complement pathway. Properdin is a plasma glycoprotein that functions as a positive regulator by stabilizing the C3 and C5 convertase enzyme complexes, thereby enhancing the opsonization and clearance of pathogens. Structurally, properdin is characterized by multiple thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSRs) and forms oligomers, such as dimers, trimers, and tetramers, which are essential for its biological activity. As a pattern recognition receptor, properdin binds to various pathogens, facilitating immune responses. Mutations or deficiencies in the CFP gene can lead to increased susceptibility to infections, particularly meningococcal disease, underscoring its clinical significance in immune defense (Degn2011DiseaseCausing; Kouser2018Human; Hourcade2006The).

## Structure
Complement factor properdin (CFP) is a plasma glycoprotein involved in the alternative pathway of the complement system. The protein is composed of multiple thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSRs), which contribute to its elongated structure. Properdin is known to form cyclic oligomers, including dimers, trimers, and tetramers, which are crucial for its function in stabilizing the C3/C5 convertase complex (Alcorlo2013Structural; Smith1984Molecular).

The primary structure of properdin includes seven TSR domains, which are essential for its interaction with other components of the complement system, such as C3b and Bb (Alcorlo2013Structural). The secondary structure of properdin is unusual, as it lacks significant amounts of alpha-helix or beta-sheet structures, suggesting a unique protein conformation (Smith1984Molecular).

Properdin's tertiary structure is characterized by its flexible, rod-like protomer, which is approximately 26.0 nm in length and 2.5 nm in diameter, with binding sites localized at each end (Smith1984Molecular). The quaternary structure involves the oligomerization of these protomers into cyclic forms, which enhances its activity in the complement system (Smith1984Molecular).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are crucial for the stability and function of properdin, although specific details on these modifications are not extensively covered in the provided context.

## Function
Properdin, encoded by the CFP gene, is a crucial positive regulator of the alternative pathway of the complement system, an essential component of the innate immune response. It functions by stabilizing the C3 and C5 convertase enzyme complexes, thereby enhancing the opsonization and clearance of pathogens. Properdin is primarily active in the plasma and on cell surfaces, where it promotes inflammation and pathogen elimination (Farries1988Analysis; Hourcade2006The).

Properdin is an oligomeric glycoprotein that forms dimers (P2), trimers (P3), and tetramers (P4) through head-to-tail associations of identical monomeric subunits. The oligomeric size of properdin is directly proportional to its function, with tetramers being the most active. In healthy human serum, these oligomers are present in a stable 20:54:26 ratio of P4, P3, and P2 (Moore2023A). Properdin is primarily released from activated leukocytes, including neutrophils, which are the most abundant granulocytes. Neutrophils release properdin stored in secondary granules in response to inflammatory stimuli (Moore2023A).

Properdin also acts as a pattern recognition receptor, binding to various pathogens and surfaces, such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Salmonella typhimurium, and Chlamydia pneumoniae, leading to complement activation (Kouser2018Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and deficiencies in the CFP gene, which encodes complement factor properdin, are clinically significant due to their impact on the immune system. Properdin deficiency is associated with a selective impairment of the alternative pathway of the complement system, leading to increased susceptibility to meningococcal infections. This condition is often investigated in individuals presenting with recurrent Neisseria meningitidis infections, fulminant infections, and meningococcal sepsis (Degn2011DiseaseCausing; Mayilyan2012Complement).

The deficiency is relatively rare, with more than 50 but fewer than 200 cases reported. It is part of a broader spectrum of complement system deficiencies, which can result in varying clinical manifestations depending on the specific component affected (Degn2011DiseaseCausing). Properdin plays a crucial role in stabilizing the alternative pathway convertase, and its deficiency can lead to impaired host defense mechanisms, potentially resulting in autoimmune diseases or tissue damage (Mayilyan2012Complement).

In addition to genetic deficiencies, alterations in the expression level of CFP may contribute to inflammatory conditions and autoimmune diseases, highlighting the importance of properdin in immune regulation (Mayilyan2012Complement).

## Interactions
Complement factor properdin (CFP) is known for its role as a positive regulator in the alternative complement pathway, primarily through its interactions with various proteins. CFP binds to the natural killer cell-activating receptor NKp46, a receptor expressed by NK cells and certain innate lymphoid cells. This interaction is specific, as CFP does not bind to NKp30, another receptor in the same family (NarniMancinelli2017Complement). The binding of CFP to NKp46 is dose-dependent and can be inhibited by anti-NKp46 blocking antibodies, indicating a specific and regulated interaction (NarniMancinelli2017Complement).

CFP also interacts with components of the complement system, such as C3b and the C3 convertase complex. It stabilizes the C3bBb convertase by binding to C3b, promoting the association with factor B, and enhancing the assembly and stability of the convertase complex on microbial surfaces (Hourcade2006The). Properdin's structure, which includes thrombospondin type I repeats, is crucial for these interactions, particularly the TSR4 and TSR5 domains that are critical for binding to C3b (Kouser2013Properdin). These interactions highlight CFP's role in immune defense by facilitating opsonization and pathogen elimination.
