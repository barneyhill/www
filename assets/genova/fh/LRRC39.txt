# LRRC39

## Overview
The LRRC39 gene encodes the protein leucine-rich repeat containing 39, also known as Myomasp, which is predominantly expressed in heart and skeletal muscle tissues. This protein is characterized by leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, and is localized specifically at the sarcomeric M-band, a critical structure for muscle contraction and mechanotransduction (Will2010MyomaspLRRC39). Myomasp interacts with the C-terminal rod domain of myosin heavy chains, particularly MYH7, playing a vital role in anchoring these molecules and maintaining the structural integrity of the M-band (Will2010MyomaspLRRC39). The protein's involvement in biomechanical stress signaling and its specific localization underscore its importance in cardiac and skeletal muscle function. Alterations in LRRC39 expression have been linked to cardiomyopathies, highlighting its clinical significance in heart disease (Will2010MyomaspLRRC39).

## Structure
The LRRC39 protein, also known as Myomasp, is characterized by the presence of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and provide a structural framework for these interactions (Will2010MyomaspLRRC39). The protein contains a coiled-coil domain and six leucine-rich repeat domains, which are highly conserved among species, indicating their importance in the protein's function (Will2010MyomaspLRRC39). These LRR motifs are common in proteins with diverse cellular functions, such as cell adhesion and signal transduction (Will2010MyomaspLRRC39).

Myomasp/LRRC39 is a heart- and muscle-specific protein localized exclusively at the sarcomeric M-band, a structure crucial for muscle contraction and mechanotransduction (Will2010MyomaspLRRC39). The protein interacts with the C-terminal rod domain of the myosin heavy chain (MYH7), suggesting a role in anchoring myosin heavy chain molecules at the M-band (Will2010MyomaspLRRC39). This interaction is significant for maintaining the structural integrity of the M-band and the overall sarcomere (Will2010MyomaspLRRC39).

The protein's molecular mass is approximately 38.8 kDa in humans and 38.7 kDa in rats, and it is predominantly expressed in heart and skeletal muscle tissues (Will2010MyomaspLRRC39). While specific details on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms are not provided, the protein's role in stretch sensing and biomechanical stress signaling is well-documented (Will2010MyomaspLRRC39).

## Function
The LRRC39 gene encodes the protein myomasp, which is predominantly expressed in heart and skeletal muscle tissues. Myomasp is a critical component of the sarcomeric M-band, a structure within muscle cells essential for muscle contraction. It interacts with myosin heavy chains, particularly the C-terminal region of MYH7, playing a role in anchoring or regulating these molecules at the M-band. This interaction is vital for maintaining the structural integrity and function of the sarcomere, the basic contractile unit of muscle cells (Will2010MyomaspLRRC39).

Myomasp is involved in biomechanical stress signaling and mechanotransduction in cardiomyocytes, contributing to the structural integrity of the M-band and the regulation of gene expression in response to mechanical stress. Its downregulation in stretched cardiomyocytes leads to altered gene expression, including the suppression of SRF-dependent transcription, affecting the expression of myomesins and myosins (Will2010MyomaspLRRC39).

In zebrafish, knockdown of myomasp results in reduced contractility, cardiomyopathy, and disturbed M-band architecture, underscoring its essential role in maintaining cardiac function and integrity (Will2010MyomaspLRRC39). The protein's localization to the M-band, rather than the Z-disc or A-band, highlights its specific role in sarcomeric structure (Will2010MyomaspLRRC39).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the LRRC39 gene have been implicated in cardiomyopathies, particularly dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), which can lead to heart failure. The LRRC39 gene encodes a heart- and muscle-specific protein that is a component of the sarcomeric M-band, playing a crucial role in stretch sensing and intracellular signaling processes. Alterations in LRRC39 expression can disrupt the structural integrity and function of the M-band, affecting the heart's ability to respond to biomechanical stress (Will2010MyomaspLRRC39).

The interaction between LRRC39 and myosin heavy chain MYH7 is particularly significant, as MYH7 mutations are known to be associated with cardiomyopathy. This interaction suggests that LRRC39 could be a candidate gene for cardiomyopathy due to its role in maintaining M-band integrity and its involvement in stress-responsive pathways (Will2010MyomaspLRRC39). Knockdown experiments in zebrafish and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes have demonstrated that reduced expression of LRRC39 leads to impaired heart function and altered expression of stress-responsive genes, further supporting its potential involvement in cardiac diseases (Will2010MyomaspLRRC39).

## Interactions
LRRC39, also known as Myomasp, is a heart- and muscle-specific protein that plays a crucial role in the sarcomeric M-band, a structure involved in muscle contraction and mechanotransduction. It is characterized by leucine-rich repeat motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions. LRRC39 interacts with the C termini of myosin heavy chains, specifically MYH1, MYH2, MYH6, and MYH7. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments have confirmed the interaction between LRRC39 and MYH7, suggesting its role in regulating or anchoring myosin heavy chain molecules at the sarcomeric M-band (Will2010MyomaspLRRC39).

The interaction with MYH7 is particularly significant as mutations in MYH7 are linked to cardiomyopathy, indicating that LRRC39 may play a role in the pathophysiology of this condition (Will2010MyomaspLRRC39). Knockdown studies in zebrafish and engineered heart tissues have shown that reducing LRRC39 levels leads to decreased expression of M-band proteins such as myomesin-1 and -2, which are crucial for muscle integrity and function (Will2010MyomaspLRRC39). These interactions highlight the importance of LRRC39 in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of muscle tissues.
