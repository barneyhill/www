# PHEX

## Overview
The PHEX gene encodes the phosphate-regulating endopeptidase homolog X-linked, a zinc-dependent metallopeptidase that plays a critical role in phosphate homeostasis and bone mineralization. This protein is a member of the M13 family of zinc metallopeptidases and functions as a type II integral membrane glycoprotein. It is predominantly expressed in bone and dental tissues, where it regulates the degradation of phosphaturic hormones, such as fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23), thereby maintaining normal phosphate levels in the body (Ruchon2000Developmental; Quarles2003FGF23). Mutations in the PHEX gene are associated with X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH), a disorder characterized by impaired phosphate reabsorption in the kidneys, leading to rickets and osteomalacia (Dixon1998Mutational). The protein's enzymatic activity and interactions with other proteins, such as matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein (MEPE), are essential for its regulatory functions in bone health (CAMPOS2003Human; Guo2002Inhibition).

## Structure
The PHEX protein is a member of the M13 family of zinc metallopeptidases and is characterized as a type II integral membrane glycoprotein. It features a short N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a large extracellular domain. The extracellular domain contains a zinc-binding motif essential for its enzymatic activity, specifically the sequence 580 HEXXH 584, which is crucial for binding zinc ions necessary for its catalytic function (Bianchetti2002M13; BOILEAU2001Characterization).

The PHEX protein also includes ten highly conserved cysteine residues within its extracellular domain, which are important for maintaining its conformational integrity and catalytic activity (Sabbagh2003Structure). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which affects its stability and function. Glycosylation sites have been identified, and treatment with N-glycosidase F reduces the protein's molecular mass, indicating the presence of N-linked glycosylation (Guo2001Analysis).

Mutations in the PHEX gene can lead to structural changes that affect its function, as seen in various missense mutations that impact protein trafficking, endopeptidase activity, and conformation (Sabbagh2003Structure). These structural features are critical for the protein's role in bone and tooth mineralization.

## Function
The PHEX gene encodes a protein that is a member of the M13 family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases, primarily expressed in bone and teeth, where it plays a crucial role in phosphate homeostasis and skeletal mineralization (Ruchon2000Developmental; Quarles2003FGF23). In healthy human cells, PHEX is involved in the degradation of phosphaturic hormones, such as fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23), which is essential for maintaining normal phosphate levels in the body (Drezner2000PHEX; CAMPOS2003Human). The protein is expressed in osteoblasts, osteocytes, and odontoblasts, indicating its significant role in bone formation and mineralization (Ruchon2000Developmental).

PHEX functions as a membrane-bound endopeptidase, and its activity is crucial for preventing excessive phosphate loss through the kidneys by converting active phosphaturic hormones into inactive metabolites (Drezner2000PHEX). The protein's enzymatic activity is characterized by a strict specificity for acidic residues, particularly aspartate, which is important for its role in cleaving peptides derived from FGF23 and matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein (MEPE) (CAMPOS2003Human). This activity is vital for regulating phosphate metabolism and ensuring proper bone health (CAMPOS2003Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PHEX gene are primarily associated with X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH), a genetic disorder characterized by low phosphate levels due to renal phosphate wasting, leading to rickets and osteomalacia. XLH is marked by growth retardation, bone deformities, and dental issues, and is often unresponsive to conventional vitamin D treatment (Dixon1998Mutational; Morey2011Genetic). The PHEX gene encodes a protein that is crucial for phosphate homeostasis, and mutations often result in a loss of function, contributing to the disease phenotype (Dixon1998Mutational).

In addition to XLH, PHEX mutations have been linked to other conditions such as tumor-induced osteomalacia, where similar phosphate regulation disruptions occur (Chesher2018Outcome). The gene's dysfunction is also implicated in otitis media in certain mouse models, where elevated fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) levels, a consequence of PHEX mutations, lead to increased prostaglandin E2 production and inflammation (Han2012Mutation).

Research has shown that the type of PHEX mutation can influence the severity of XLH, with some mutations leading to more severe phenotypes due to lower tubular reabsorption of phosphate and altered vitamin D metabolism (Morey2011Genetic). However, genotype-phenotype correlations are not always straightforward, as both truncating and non-truncating mutations can result in similar functional impairments (Zheng2020Functional).

## Interactions
PHEX, a phosphate-regulating endopeptidase, is involved in several interactions with other proteins, influencing phosphate homeostasis and bone mineralization. PHEX is known to interact with FGF23, a phosphaturic hormone, although the nature of this interaction is debated. Some studies suggest that PHEX can degrade FGF23, but others have not observed this cleavage, indicating that FGF23 may not be a direct substrate for PHEX (BenetPagès2004FGF23; Quarles2003FGF23).

PHEX also interacts with MEPE, a matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein. While PHEX does not directly cleave MEPE, it inhibits its degradation by cathepsin B-like enzymes, suggesting a regulatory role rather than a direct enzymatic interaction (Guo2002Inhibition). This inhibition does not require PHEX's enzymatic activity, indicating a non-enzymatic mechanism, possibly involving protein-protein interactions (Guo2002Inhibition).

The interactions of PHEX with these proteins are crucial for understanding its role in disorders like X-linked hypophosphatemia, where PHEX mutations disrupt normal phosphate and mineral metabolism (Quarles2003FGF23). Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms and physiological relevance of these interactions.
