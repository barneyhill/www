# TMEM102

## Overview
TMEM102 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 102, which is involved in various cellular processes. As a transmembrane protein, it is integral to cellular signaling pathways and has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The protein plays a crucial role in modulating signaling pathways such as Raf-MEK-ERK and Akt-mTORC1, which are essential for cell proliferation and survival (Chiang2018CBAP). Its expression levels have been associated with disease progression and prognosis, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Kowalski2016Gene; Wan2020Establishment). Additionally, TMEM102 is involved in immune response regulation, particularly in T-cell migration and activation, highlighting its significance in both oncological and immunological contexts (Imamoto2023Different).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
TMEM102, also known as CBAP, has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in cellular signaling pathways. In T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), TMEM102 is highly expressed and is essential for leukemia cell proliferation and leukemogenesis. It modulates key signaling pathways, including Raf-MEK-ERK and Akt-mTORC1, which are crucial for leukemia cell growth. Downregulation of TMEM102 reduces leukemia cell expansion and disease severity, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in T-ALL (Chiang2018CBAP).

In non-emphysematous chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), TMEM102 is upregulated and associated with the positive regulation of T-cell migration and activation. This upregulation may contribute to T-helper cell activation, indicating a role in the immune response and airway remodeling in this COPD subgroup (Imamoto2023Different).

TMEM102 has also been identified as part of a prognostic model for gastric cancer, where its expression is linked to patient survival outcomes. Lower expression of TMEM102 is associated with higher risk groups, suggesting its potential role in cancer prognosis (Wan2020Establishment). In multiple myeloma, TMEM102 is part of a gene set with altered expression and copy number changes, impacting overall survival (Kowalski2016Gene).
