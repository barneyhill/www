# HTT

## Overview
The HTT gene encodes the huntingtin protein, a large and multifunctional protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including intracellular transport, gene expression regulation, and neurogenesis. Huntingtin is characterized by its complex structure, which includes a polyglutamine tract and intrinsically disordered regions that facilitate its diverse interactions and regulatory functions (Seefelder2022Huntingtin). The protein is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and is essential for normal cellular function. However, mutations in the HTT gene, particularly the expansion of CAG repeats, lead to the production of a mutant form of huntingtin, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease, a severe neurodegenerative disorder (Wild2019One; Tabrizi2019Huntingtin). The study of HTT and its encoded protein continues to be a significant focus in understanding and potentially treating Huntington's disease (Wild2017Therapies).

## Structure
The huntingtin (HTT) protein is a large protein composed of 3144 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 348 kDa. Its primary structure includes a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract of 23 glutamines, which is significant in the context of Huntington's disease (Seefelder2022Huntingtin). The secondary structure of HTT is predominantly composed of alpha-helices, with a high helical content supported by HEAT repeat motifs, which are degenerate motifs consisting of two anti-parallel α-helices forming a helical hairpin (Li2006Expression).

The tertiary structure of HTT is complex, featuring two large domains separated by a hinge, which fold back towards each other rather than forming a linear solenoid. This structure is supported by cryo-electron microscopy and negative-staining transmission electron microscopy studies (Seefelder2022Huntingtin). The quaternary structure involves the formation of a stable complex with huntingtin-associated protein 40 (HAP40), characterized by a tight interaction with a significant hydrophobic interface (Seefelder2022Huntingtin).

HTT contains intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) that are targets for post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence the protein's structure and activity (Seefelder2022Huntingtin). These IDRs contribute to the protein's flexibility and are involved in its regulatory functions (Seefelder2022Huntingtin).

## Function
The HTT gene encodes the huntingtin protein, which plays a critical role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. Huntingtin is involved in vesicular and organelle transport, endocytosis, autophagosome formation, protein degradation, mitosis, and primary cilia formation. It interacts with microtubules and actin cytoskeletal components, suggesting its role in maintaining cellular structure and transport (Taran2020Huntington’s). During cell division, HTT localizes at spindle poles and is essential for proper mitotic spindle positioning, preventing spindle misorientation and mitotic disturbances (Taran2020Huntington’s).

In neurons, HTT regulates both anterograde and retrograde transport of organelles, including presynaptic vesicles and lysosomes, by interacting with huntingtin-associated protein 1 (HAP1) and other transport proteins (Taran2020Huntington’s). It also plays a role in primary cilia formation by transporting PCM1 protein to the basal body, affecting cilia number and length (Taran2020Huntington’s).

HTT is involved in neurogenesis and may regulate the proliferative potential of precursor cells while blocking apoptosis by inhibiting caspases 3 and 9 (Taran2020Huntington’s). It also participates in mitochondrial function and mitophagy, ensuring the degradation of damaged mitochondria and maintaining cellular homeostasis (FrancoIborra2020Mutant).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HTT gene, particularly the expansion of CAG repeats, are directly linked to Huntington's disease (HD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor dysfunction, cognitive decline, and psychiatric symptoms (Wild2019One; Tabrizi2019Huntingtin). The disease is caused by a toxic gain of function due to the production of a mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT), which leads to cellular dysfunction and neurodegeneration (Wild2017Therapies). HD is an autosomal dominant disorder, meaning that a mutation in just one of the two copies of the HTT gene is sufficient to cause the disease (Palaiogeorgou2022Recent).

The mutant huntingtin protein is ubiquitously expressed and affects not only neuronal cells but also peripheral tissues, leading to symptoms such as skeletal muscle dysfunction, cardiac failure, and weight loss (Cisbani2012An). The instability of CAG repeats in fibroblasts and the impact on energy metabolism due to impaired transcription factors like PGC-1a are also noted (Cisbani2012An). Additionally, the presence of CAA interruptions within the CAG repeat region can influence the age of onset and progression of HD, suggesting a role in DNA repair accuracy (Wild2019One). Despite extensive research, no successful treatment has been found to slow HD progression in patients (Wild2019One).

## Interactions
The huntingtin (HTT) protein is involved in numerous interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. HTT interacts with transcription factors such as specificity protein 1 (SP1) and neurogenic differentiation factor 1, as well as transcriptional repressors like RE1-silencing transcription factor, influencing gene expression regulation (Wanker2019The). It also binds to components of the core transcription apparatus, including transcription factors II D and II F (Wanker2019The).

In the context of intracellular trafficking and endocytosis, HTT interacts with proteins such as HIP14, PACSIN 1, and SH3GL3, which are involved in synaptic vesicle recycling and endocytosis (Li2004Huntingtin–protein). HTT also associates with postsynaptic density 95 (PSD-95), a scaffold protein that clusters and activates receptors in the postsynaptic membrane (Li2004Huntingtin–protein).

Mutant HTT (mHTT) exhibits altered interactions, such as enhanced binding to SP1, which represses SP1-dependent transcription, and abnormal interactions with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPAR-d), contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction (Wanker2019The). mHTT also interacts with the GTPase Rhes, affecting mTOR signaling, and with Beclin-1, impacting autophagy processes (Wanker2019The). These interactions are implicated in the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease.
