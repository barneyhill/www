# PLEKHG1

## Overview
PLEKHG1 is a gene that encodes the protein pleckstrin homology and RhoGEF domain containing G1, which is a member of the Dbl family of Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs). This protein is characterized by the presence of Dbl homology (DH) and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, which are crucial for its function in activating Rho GTPases, such as Cdc42. The DH domain facilitates the catalytic activity necessary for Rho GTPase activation, while the PH domain is involved in phospholipid binding, influencing the protein's subcellular localization and regulatory functions (Reinhard2019Identification; Reinhard2019Selectivity). PLEKHG1 plays a significant role in intracellular signaling pathways, particularly in endothelial cells, where it is one of the strongest activators of Cdc42, impacting processes such as cell adhesion, migration, and polarity (Reinhard2019Identification). The protein's activity is essential for cytoskeletal organization and cellular responses to mechanical stress, underscoring its importance in vascular and immune system functions (Gray2018GeneCentric).

## Structure
PLEKHG1 encodes a protein that is part of the Dbl family of Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs), characterized by the presence of Dbl homology (DH) and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains. The DH domain is responsible for the catalytic activity that activates Rho GTPases, such as Cdc42, while the PH domain is involved in phospholipid binding and can influence the protein's subcellular localization and regulatory functions (Reinhard2019Identification; Reinhard2019Selectivity). 

The PH domain may also contribute to autoinhibition and scaffolding of related signaling proteins, affecting the protein's activity and interactions (Reinhard2019Identification). PLEKHG1 has been identified as one of the strongest activators of Cdc42 in endothelial cells, with its DHPH domain showing significant activity towards Cdc42 (Reinhard2019Identification; Reinhard2019Selectivity). 

The molecular structure of PLEKHG1 includes these domains, but specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures are not provided in the available context. The protein's activity and localization are crucial for its role in cellular signaling and cytoskeletal organization (Reinhard2019Identification).

## Function
PLEKHG1 encodes a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RhoGEF) that plays a significant role in intracellular signaling pathways, particularly in the activation of Rho family GTPases such as Cdc42. These GTPases are crucial for regulating cytoskeletal dynamics, cell migration, and cellular morphology (Reinhard2019Identification). PLEKHG1 is involved in actin cytoskeletal organization and mediates endothelial cell responses to mechanical stress, suggesting its role in vascular and immune system processes (Gray2018GeneCentric). 

In endothelial cells, PLEKHG1 is one of the strongest activators of Cdc42, a small GTPase involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and polarity (Reinhard2019Identification). The protein's activity is particularly noted in the plasma membrane, where it influences local Cdc42 activation, potentially affecting signaling processes in endothelial cells (Reinhard2019Identification). 

PLEKHG1 is expressed across a wide range of tissues, and its specific function in healthy human cells remains largely unknown. However, its involvement in several biological processes and conditions, such as blood pressure regulation and immune function, indicates its broader physiological significance (Gray2018GeneCentric).

## Clinical Significance
The PLEKHG1 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in intracellular signaling pathways. Variants in PLEKHG1 have been associated with blood pressure regulation, with specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to both systolic and diastolic blood pressure traits in multiethnic genome-wide association studies (Gray2018GeneCentric). The gene is also associated with preeclampsia, a pregnancy-specific disorder characterized by high blood pressure, where SNPs such as rs9478812 and rs11155751 have shown significant associations, particularly in early-onset cases (Gray2018GeneCentric).

PLEKHG1 has been linked to other conditions, including sickle cell anemia, cognitive decline, obesity-related traits, alcohol and nicotine codependence, and panic disorder (Gray2018GeneCentric). In the context of cancer, PLEKHG1 is part of a seven-gene signature associated with better survival outcomes in advanced lung adenocarcinoma, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhao2021A). Additionally, PLEKHG1 is noted as a significant locus for white matter hyperintensities, a model trait for cerebral small-vessel disease, indicating its role in vascular endothelial function (Rutten‐Jacobs2019Emerging). These associations highlight the gene's involvement in various physiological and pathological processes.
