# P2RY10

## Overview
P2RY10 is a gene that encodes a member of the P2Y receptor family, specifically the P2Y10 receptor, which is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). This receptor is involved in various cellular signaling pathways, particularly in the immune system, where it plays a critical role in the migration of CD4 and CD8 T cells. The P2Y10 receptor is activated by ligands such as lysophosphatidylserine (LysoPS) and ATP, which are essential for cell polarization and movement. It is expressed in several tissues, including immune cells and platelets, and is implicated in both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions, such as autoimmune diseases and cancer. The receptor's involvement in ATP-dependent calcium signaling and its interaction with pannexin channels underscore its significance in cellular communication and potential as a therapeutic target (Amisten2008Gene; Gurusamy2021Gproteincoupled; Shi2024The).

## Function
The P2RY10 gene encodes the P2Y10 receptor, a G-protein-coupled receptor involved in the regulation of CD4 T cell migration. This receptor plays a crucial role in chemokine-induced migration through autocrine and paracrine mediators, such as lysophosphatidylserine (LysoPS) and ATP, which activate RhoA, a small GTPase essential for cell polarization and movement (Gurusamy2021Gproteincoupled). P2Y10 is a major ATP receptor in CD4 T cells, facilitating ATP-dependent calcium signaling and IP1 production, which are important for cell migration (Gurusamy2021Gproteincoupled).

The receptor is expressed in both CD4 and CD8 T cells, indicating its broader role in immune cell migration and function (Gurusamy2021Gproteincoupled). P2Y10's activity is mediated by pannexin channels, particularly pannexin 1, which are involved in ATP release necessary for the migration process (Gurusamy2021Gproteincoupled). In healthy human cells, P2Y10 contributes to normal migratory behavior, although its role becomes more pronounced under inflammatory conditions, such as autoimmune diseases, where it may influence CD4 T cell infiltration into tissues (Gurusamy2021Gproteincoupled).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the P2RY10 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In autoimmune diseases, P2RY10 plays a significant role in CD4 T cell migration, which is crucial for immune cell trafficking under inflammatory conditions. Mice lacking P2RY10 in CD4 T cells exhibit reduced severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for multiple sclerosis, suggesting that targeting P2RY10 could be a potential therapeutic strategy for autoimmune diseases (Gurusamy2021Gproteincoupled).

In cancer, P2RY10 is co-expressed with the lncRNA TRG-AS1 and is involved in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. Knockdown of TRG-AS1 and silencing of P2RY10 suppress cell viability, colony formation, and migration in CRC cells, indicating that P2RY10 contributes to tumor growth and could serve as a therapeutic target (Shi2024The). P2RY10 is also associated with the tumor microenvironment and is considered a prognostic factor in cutaneous melanoma and renal cell carcinoma (Shi2024The).

P2RY10 expression is noted in synovial tissues and peripheral blood in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and coronary artery disease, suggesting its involvement in inflammatory conditions (Shi2024The). These findings highlight the potential of P2RY10 as a target for therapeutic intervention in various diseases.

## Interactions
P2RY10, a member of the P2Y receptor family, is involved in various interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. In colorectal cancer (CRC) cells, P2RY10 is co-expressed with the long non-coding RNA TRG-AS1. The interaction between TRG-AS1 and P2RY10 is mutual, as the knockdown of one affects the expression of the other. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of GNA12 and GNA13 signaling pathways, which are associated with tumor progression. Specifically, P2RY10 activates GNA12/13 signaling, promoting CRC cell proliferation and migration. The overexpression of GNA13 can reverse the effects of TRG-AS1 knockdown or P2RY10 silencing, indicating a regulatory relationship between these molecules (Shi2024The).

In human platelets, P2RY10 is one of the most abundantly expressed G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) mRNAs. Although specific protein interactions involving P2RY10 in platelets are not detailed, its expression suggests potential roles in platelet aggregation and signaling pathways (Amisten2008Gene). The expression of P2RY10 in various tissues and its involvement in signaling pathways highlight its potential as a therapeutic target in different diseases, including cancer and immune-related conditions.
