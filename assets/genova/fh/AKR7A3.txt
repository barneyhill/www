# AKR7A3

## Overview
AKR7A3 is a gene that encodes the protein aldo-keto reductase family 7 member A3, which is part of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily. This protein functions primarily as a cytosolic enzyme involved in the detoxification of harmful compounds, notably the carcinogen aflatoxin B1. AKR7A3 catalyzes the reduction of aflatoxin B1 dihydrodiol to less toxic dialcohol forms, thereby playing a protective role against aflatoxin-induced cytotoxicity and carcinogenesis (Knight1999cDNA). The enzyme is characterized by a conserved (α/β)8-barrel structure, facilitating its enzymatic activity without the need for metal ions (Mindnich2009Aldoketo; Ma2011Human). AKR7A3 is expressed in various human tissues, with significant expression in the liver, kidney, and pancreas, and its activity is regulated by oxidative stress-responsive pathways, highlighting its role in cellular defense mechanisms (Knight1999cDNA; Ahmed2011Aldoketo).

## Structure
AKR7A3 is a member of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily, characterized by a conserved (α/β)8-barrel structure, also known as the TIM barrel. This structure is evolutionarily conserved and facilitates the enzyme's function without the need for metal ions (Mindnich2009Aldoketo; Ma2011Human). The active site of AKR7A3 includes a catalytic tetrad, typically consisting of Tyr-48, His-110, Lys-77, and Asp-43, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Ma2011Human). 

AKR7A3 is primarily a cytosolic enzyme and functions as a monomer, although some AKR family members can form multimers (Mindnich2009Aldoketo). The enzyme binds NAD(P)H in an extended anti-conformation, which is essential for catalyzing hydride transfer during the reduction of carbonyl groups to alcohols (Mindnich2009Aldoketo). 

The protein is composed of 331 amino acids, with a calculated molecular weight of approximately 37.2 kDa (Bodreddigari2008Protection). Despite the presence of alternative splicing in many AKR genes, no alternative splicing events have been discovered for AKR7A3, indicating a single protein isoform (Barski2013Alternative). Specific post-translational modifications or additional structural details have not been extensively documented in the available literature.

## Function
The AKR7A3 gene encodes a protein that is part of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily, which plays a crucial role in detoxifying harmful compounds in human cells. AKR7A3 is primarily involved in the metabolism of aflatoxin B1, a potent carcinogen, by catalyzing the reduction of aflatoxin B1 dihydrodiol to aflatoxin B1 dialcohol, a process that requires NADPH (Knight1999cDNA). This enzymatic activity helps protect cells from aflatoxin-induced damage by reducing the formation of protein adducts and related cytotoxicity (Knight1999cDNA).

AKR7A3 is expressed in various human tissues, including the liver, kidney, pancreas, small intestine, and skeletal muscle, with the highest expression levels observed in the stomach, pancreas, kidney, and liver (Knight1999cDNA). The protein is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis and metabolic processes by reducing aldehydes and ketones to their corresponding alcohols (Penning2007Human).

The expression of AKR7A3 is regulated by the nuclear factor erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which is activated in response to oxidative stress. This regulation enhances the protein's role in cellular defense mechanisms, particularly in protecting against oxidative stress and maintaining cell viability under stress conditions (Ahmed2011Aldoketo).

## Clinical Significance
AKR7A3 plays a significant role in detoxifying aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), a potent carcinogen linked to primary hepatocellular carcinoma. The enzyme reduces AFB1 dialdehyde to less reactive alcohol forms, thereby decreasing its cytotoxicity and the formation of harmful protein adducts. This protective mechanism is crucial in mitigating the toxic effects of AFB1, which can lead to liver cancer (Bodreddigari2008Protection). AKR7A3 expression is detectable in human liver samples, although generally lower than AKR7A2, suggesting a potential role in liver detoxification processes (Bodreddigari2008Protection).

Alterations in AKR7A3 expression or function may impact its ability to detoxify harmful compounds, potentially contributing to disease development. While specific diseases directly linked to AKR7A3 mutations or expression changes are not detailed, its role in detoxifying carcinogens like aflatoxin suggests its importance in preventing liver damage and cancer (Penning2007Human). The enzyme's involvement in reducing aflatoxin-mediated hepatotoxicity highlights its potential clinical significance in conditions related to aflatoxin exposure (Bodreddigari2008Protection). Understanding the regulation and expression of AKR7A3 could provide insights into therapeutic approaches for diseases associated with aflatoxin exposure and other related toxicities.
