# CHCHD10

## Overview
The CHCHD10 gene encodes the coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain containing 10 protein, which is integral to mitochondrial function and cellular homeostasis. This protein is characterized by its CHCH domain, which facilitates its import into mitochondria and is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial cristae structure and function (Purandare2018The; Burstein2017In). CHCHD10 is involved in the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) complex, playing a vital role in organizing the inner mitochondrial membrane and ensuring mitochondrial DNA stability (Genin2015CHCHD). Additionally, CHCHD10 has a nuclear role as a transcriptional repressor, interacting with CXXC5 to regulate genes containing oxygen-responsive elements (Purandare2018The). Mutations in CHCHD10 are linked to various neurodegenerative and neuromuscular disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining cellular and mitochondrial integrity (Ikeda2022Neurodegenerationassociated; Keith2020Neuropathologic).

## Structure
The CHCHD10 protein is characterized by a coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix (CHCH) domain, which is crucial for its mitochondrial import and function. This domain is located at the C-terminus of the protein and is essential for its structural integrity, as it contains cysteine residues that form disulfide bonds, stabilizing the protein within the mitochondrial intermembrane space (Purandare2018The; Burstein2017In). The CHCHD10 protein also features a positively charged N-terminal region, often referred to as a mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS), which aids in its localization to mitochondria, although the CHCH domain plays a more dominant role in mitochondrial import (Lehmer2018A).

Mutations within the CHCH domain, such as Q108P and C122R, can significantly impair mitochondrial import, leading to cytoplasmic mislocalization and reduced protein stability (Lehmer2018A). The protein is also involved in interactions with other mitochondrial proteins, such as CHCHD2 and p32, and is suggested to play a role in mitochondrial cristae morphology and function (Ikeda2022Neurodegenerationassociated; Burstein2017In). These structural features and interactions highlight the importance of CHCHD10 in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function.

## Function
The CHCHD10 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in mitochondrial and nuclear functions in healthy human cells. In mitochondria, CHCHD10 is involved in maintaining the structure and function of mitochondrial cristae, which are essential for energy production and mitochondrial genome maintenance. It is a component of the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) complex, which is crucial for organizing the inner mitochondrial membrane and ensuring the stability of mitochondrial DNA (Genin2015CHCHD). CHCHD10 interacts with cytochrome c oxidase (COX) to stimulate its activity, which is vital for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production. This interaction is dependent on the presence of MNRR1, and CHCHD10's role is significant under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions (Purandare2018The).

In the nucleus, CHCHD10 acts as a transcriptional repressor of genes containing the oxygen-responsive element (ORE), interacting with the transcriptional repressor CXXC5. This function is part of a finely tuned oxygen-sensing system in human cells (Purandare2018The). CHCHD10's proper functioning is also linked to the regulation of apoptosis, as it influences the sequestration of cytochrome c within the cristae (Genin2015CHCHD).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CHCHD10 gene are associated with a range of neurodegenerative and neuromuscular disorders. These include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), mitochondrial myopathy, ataxia, parkinsonism, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 (CMT2) (Ikeda2022Neurodegenerationassociated; Keith2020Neuropathologic). The gene is also linked to late-onset spinal motor neuropathy (SMAJ) and Jokela type spinal muscular atrophy (Genin2015CHCHD; Keith2020Neuropathologic).

Mutations in CHCHD10 can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, characterized by the disassembly of the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) complex, loss of mitochondrial cristae, and nucleoid disorganization. This results in impaired mitochondrial DNA repair and respiratory chain deficiencies (Ikeda2022Neurodegenerationassociated; Genin2015CHCHD). Specific mutations, such as S59L, have been linked to TDP-43 protein aggregation, which is associated with neurodegenerative diseases (Ikeda2022Neurodegenerationassociated).

The CHCHD10 gene mutations also inhibit apoptosis by preventing cytochrome c release, which may contribute to the accumulation of dysfunctional neurons and perpetuate neurodegenerative processes (Genin2015CHCHD). These mutations are primarily missense substitutions, with some known to cause a loss-of-function mechanism (Keith2020Neuropathologic).

## Interactions
CHCHD10 is known to interact with several proteins, primarily within the mitochondria. It forms complexes with CHCHD2, another mitochondrial protein, and these complexes are crucial for mitochondrial function. CHCHD10 and CHCHD2 are largely hetero-oligomers, and their interaction is significant for maintaining mitochondrial respiration, especially under stress conditions that increase oxidative stress (Straub2017Loss; Burstein2017In). 

CHCHD10 also interacts with the protein p32 (C1QBP), which is involved in mitochondrial translation. This interaction is consistent and robust, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Straub2017Loss; Burstein2017In). However, CHCHD10 does not form stable interactions with the MICOS complex, specifically mitofilin, suggesting its role in mitochondrial architecture is independent of MICOS (Burstein2017In).

In addition to its mitochondrial interactions, CHCHD10 has a nuclear role where it interacts with CXXC5, a transcriptional repressor, to down-regulate genes containing the oxygen-responsive element (ORE) in their promoters. This interaction is disrupted by certain mutations, which also affect its mitochondrial functions (Purandare2018The). These interactions highlight CHCHD10's dual role in regulating both mitochondrial and nuclear functions.
