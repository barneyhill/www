# MCF2L

## Overview
The MCF2L gene encodes a protein that belongs to the Dbl family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which are pivotal in cellular signaling pathways. This protein, known as MCF.2 cell line derived transforming sequence like, plays a crucial role in activating Rho family GTPases, such as Rac1 and RhoA, which are involved in various cellular processes including cytoskeletal organization, cell migration, and growth (Maiwald2015A; Mao2019miR1403p). The MCF2L protein is characterized by domains such as the Dbl homology (DH) and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, essential for its function. It exists in multiple isoforms, which may have distinct structural and functional roles, particularly in the context of diseases like cancer and osteoarthritis (Shepherd2015Expression; dos2020Reboot:). The gene's expression and activity are regulated by various factors, including genetic variants and microRNAs, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and pathological conditions (Shepherd2015Expression; Mao2019miR1403p).

## Structure
The MCF2L gene encodes a protein that is part of the Dbl family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which are involved in cellular signaling pathways. The protein typically contains domains such as the Dbl homology (DH) domain and the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which are crucial for its function in activating Rho family GTPases (Mao2019miR1403p). The MCF2L protein has splice variant isoforms, including the canonical MCF2L-232 and the alternative splicing isoform MCF2L-201. The MCF2L-201 isoform lacks three protein domains—RhoGEF, Spectrin, and CRAL_TRIO_2—that are present in the canonical isoform, but retains the PH and SH3_2 domains, suggesting a different protein structure and potentially distinct functional roles (dos2020Reboot:).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may regulate the activity of the MCF2L protein, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context (Mao2019miR1403p). The structural differences between the isoforms may have implications for their roles in cellular processes and disease prognosis, particularly in cancer (dos2020Reboot:).

## Function
The MCF2L gene encodes a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that is part of the Rho family, which includes signaling molecules involved in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, MCF2L facilitates the activation of the small GTPases Rac1 and RhoA. Rac1 is involved in cellular functions such as cell movement and growth, while RhoA plays a role in the formation of stress fibers by bundling F-actin filaments, contributing to cell structure and movement (Maiwald2015A). The wild-type MCF2L, specifically the MCF2L689Asp variant, is capable of activating Rac1, as demonstrated in experiments using HeLa cells (Maiwald2015A).

MCF2L is expressed in several tissues, including cartilage, synovial membrane, and infrapatellar fat pad, where it interacts with signaling proteins involved in chondrocyte development and hypertrophy. It also interacts with proteins involved in the invasive properties of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (Shepherd2015Expression). The gene is active in the cytoplasm and plays a role in neuronal development and function, influencing cytoskeletal dynamics, cell migration, and growth (Shepherd2015Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MCF2L gene have been implicated in several diseases. A rare variant, c.2066A>G (p.Asp689Gly), in the MCF2L gene has been associated with premature atherosclerosis. This variant impairs the activation of the Rac1 and RhoA pathways, which are crucial for cellular signaling and stress fiber formation. The MCF2L protein is found in atherosclerotic lesions but not in healthy arteries, suggesting its role in the development of atherosclerosis (Maiwald2015A).

In osteoarthritis (OA), the MCF2L gene is linked to disease susceptibility through an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) marked by the SNP rs11842874. This SNP is associated with increased MCF2L expression in synovial tissue, potentially contributing to OA risk (Shepherd2015Expression).

In cancer, the long non-coding RNA MCF2L-AS1, related to the MCF2L gene, plays a role in drug resistance and cancer progression. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), MCF2L-AS1 is upregulated and contributes to resistance against the drug Gefitinib by stabilizing Cyclin D1 mRNA (Shan2022E2F1induced). In colorectal cancer, MCF2L-AS1 promotes malignancy by acting as a competing endogenous RNA, affecting the miR-105-5p/RAB22A axis (Kong2021LncRNA).

## Interactions
MCF2L, also known as DBS, is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that interacts with small GTPases such as Rac1 and RhoA, which are crucial for cellular signaling pathways. The MCF2L protein is involved in activating these GTPases, influencing processes like cell signaling and cytoskeletal organization. A rare variant of MCF2L, specifically the c.2066A>G; p.(Asp689Gly) mutation, has been shown to impair its ability to activate Rac1 and RhoA, as demonstrated in HeLa cells where the variant failed to induce stress fiber formation and cell rounding, unlike the wild-type protein (Maiwald2015A).

In the context of osteoarthritis, MCF2L interacts with signaling proteins involved in chondrocyte development and fibroblast-like synoviocytes, playing a role in joint tissue biology. The expression of MCF2L is modulated by genetic variants, such as the SNP rs11842874, which affects its transcriptional regulation in joint tissues (Shepherd2015Expression).

In osteoporosis, MCF2L is targeted by miR-140-3p, which binds to its 3′-UTR, leading to downregulation of MCF2L expression. This interaction affects preosteoblast viability, differentiation, and apoptosis, highlighting the regulatory role of miR-140-3p on MCF2L in bone health (Mao2019miR1403p).
