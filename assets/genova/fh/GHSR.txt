# GHSR

## Overview
The GHSR gene encodes the growth hormone secretagogue receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of growth hormone release and energy homeostasis. This receptor is primarily activated by ghrelin, a peptide hormone known for its role in stimulating appetite and influencing energy balance. GHSR is characterized by its seven-transmembrane helical structure, typical of class A GPCRs, and is expressed in key brain regions such as the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, which are integral to growth hormone regulation (Shiimura2020Structure; Guan1997Distribution). The receptor's interactions with various proteins and its constitutive activity are crucial for its function in physiological processes, including appetite regulation, glucose metabolism, and potentially cognitive functions (PerisSampedro2021Genetic; Chanoine2009Ghrelin). Mutations in the GHSR gene have been associated with growth-related disorders, underscoring the importance of its regulatory mechanisms in maintaining normal growth and development (PugliesePires2011Novel; Pantel2006Loss).

## Structure
The growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a canonical seven-transmembrane helical architecture typical of class A GPCRs (Shiimura2020Structure). The primary structure of GHSR consists of a sequence of amino acids forming these seven transmembrane helices, which are integral to its function in signal transduction (Pacull2020Integration). The secondary structure includes alpha-helices, which are common in GPCRs, and the receptor features an intracellular amphipathic helix 8 (Shiimura2020Structure).

The tertiary structure involves the arrangement of these helices within the cell membrane, creating a bifurcated ligand-binding pocket divided by a salt bridge between E124 and R283 (Wang2021Molecular). This pocket is crucial for ligand binding and receptor activation, with the octanoyl moiety of ghrelin occupying a hydrophobic crevasse between transmembrane helices 6 and 7 (Liu2021Structural). 

GHSR undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its activity. The gene has known splice variants, including GHSR1a, the active receptor, and GHSR1b, a truncated form lacking full functionality (Sun2022Binding). These structural features are essential for the receptor's role in growth hormone release and its interaction with ligands like ghrelin.

## Function
The growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) is a G-protein-coupled receptor that plays a crucial role in the regulation of growth hormone (GH) release. It is primarily activated by ghrelin, a peptide hormone that stimulates appetite and energy balance. GHSR is expressed in various regions of the brain, including the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, which are key areas for GH regulation (Kojima1999Ghrelin; Guan1997Distribution). The receptor's activation leads to intracellular calcium mobilization through protein kinase C activation and phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis, facilitating GH release (Guan1997Distribution).

GHSR is also involved in mediating the effects of ghrelin on appetite regulation. In experiments with Ghsr-null mice, ghrelin's ability to stimulate food intake was absent, indicating that GHSR is necessary for ghrelin's appetite-stimulating effects (Sun2004Ghrelin). Beyond its role in GH release and appetite, GHSR is implicated in various physiological processes, including energy homeostasis, glucose regulation, and potentially influencing learning, memory, and behavior through its expression in the hippocampus and other brain regions (Guan1997Distribution; PerisSampedro2021Genetic). The receptor's constitutive activity is also important for maintaining the integrity of the GH-IGF-1 axis, which is crucial for growth and development (Chanoine2009Ghrelin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GHSR gene, which encodes the growth hormone secretagogue receptor, have been linked to several growth-related conditions. The A204E mutation is associated with familial short stature and exhibits a dominant inheritance pattern with incomplete penetrance. This mutation impairs the receptor's constitutive activity while maintaining its response to ghrelin, suggesting a unique mechanism for growth failure (Pantel2006Loss; Vassart2011G). Another mutation, F279L, also results in reduced constitutive activity and is found in individuals with short stature (TAO2008Constitutive).

The p.R237W mutation, located in the third intracellular loop of the receptor, is linked to partial isolated growth hormone deficiency (IGHD). This mutation shows normal receptor function but a partial loss of constitutive activity, contributing to growth issues (Pantel2009Recessive). Additionally, novel inactivating mutations such as p.Ser84Ile and p.Val182Ala have been identified in patients with constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP), affecting receptor activity and expression (PugliesePires2011Novel).

These mutations highlight the critical role of GHSR's constitutive activity in growth regulation and suggest that alterations in this gene can lead to various growth-related disorders.

## Interactions
The growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a (GHSR1a) engages in various interactions with other proteins, influencing its signaling pathways. GHSR1a forms heterodimers with its truncated splice variant GHSR1b, which exerts a dominant-negative effect on GHSR1a signaling by reducing its constitutive activity and altering receptor trafficking (Price2022The). It also interacts with the neuronal sigma-1 receptor (σ1R), where cocaine enhances their co-localization, potentially affecting appetite suppression (Price2022The).

GHSR1a interacts with the melanocortin receptor accessory protein-2 (MRAP2), which enhances GHSR1a signaling by inhibiting its constitutive activity and promoting agonist-mediated calcium signaling (Rouault2020The; Price2022The). MRAP2 biases GHSR1a signaling towards Gαq-dependent pathways, reducing β-arrestin recruitment (Rouault2020The).

GHSR1a forms complexes with dopamine receptor D1 (DRD1), leading to a switch in G protein coupling from Gq to Gs, particularly in striatal neurons (Price2022The). It also interacts with the oxytocin receptor (OTR), where co-expression reduces oxytocin-induced calcium signaling, suggesting potential co-internalization of the receptors (Wallace2019A).

These interactions highlight the complex role of GHSR1a in modulating various signaling pathways, impacting functions such as appetite regulation and energy homeostasis.
