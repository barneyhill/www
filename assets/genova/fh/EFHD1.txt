# EFHD1

## Overview
EFHD1 is a gene that encodes the protein EF-hand domain family member D1, also known as Swiprosin-2. This protein is a member of the EF-hand superfamily, characterized by its calcium-binding EF-hand motifs, which play a crucial role in calcium signaling and actin-binding activities. EFHD1 is primarily localized in the mitochondria, where it contributes to mitochondrial morphology, energy synthesis, and cellular survival by regulating the mitochondrial membrane permeability transition pore (mPTP) and interacting with proteins such as adenine nucleotide translocase-3 (ANT3) (Shen2024EFHD1; Mun2021Structural). Additionally, EFHD1 is involved in cytoskeletal organization through its actin-binding and bundling activities, which are modulated by calcium and zinc ions (Mun2023Structural). The gene's expression and function are implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including neuronal differentiation, oxidative stress response, and cancer, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target (Dütting2011Fraternal; Huang2021Identification).

## Structure
The EFHD1 protein, also known as Swiprosin-2, is characterized by its EF-hand motifs, which are helix-loop-helix structures capable of binding calcium ions. These motifs are crucial for the protein's function and contribute to its secondary and tertiary structures (Dütting2011Fraternal). The core domain of EFHD1 includes two EF-hand motifs, an LM-helix, a proline-rich (PR) region, and a C-terminal linker. The EF-hand motifs coordinate Ca2+ ions, with EF-hand 1 showing a distorted pentagonal bipyramid geometry and EF-hand 2 maintaining a general pentagonal bipyramid geometry (Mun2021Structural). The structure is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds, with the PR region interacting with EF-hand 2 through these interactions (Mun2021Structural).

EFHD1 also contains a disordered region and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain, which are common features in proteins of this family (Dütting2011Fraternal). The protein can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, with five predicted protein-coding splice variants resulting in potential protein products ranging from 81 to 239 amino acids (Dütting2011Fraternal). EFHD1 is not encoded by mitochondrial DNA and translocates from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria after translation (Mun2021Structural).

## Function
EFHD1 (EF-hand domain family member D1) is a mitochondrial protein involved in several cellular processes, primarily through its role in calcium signaling and actin-binding activities. It is part of the EF-hand superfamily, known for their calcium-binding capabilities, which allows EFHD1 to act as a calcium sensor within the mitochondria. This protein is involved in regulating mitochondrial morphology and energy synthesis, contributing to cellular energy metabolism and survival (Mun2023Structural; Mun2021Structural).

EFHD1 is localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane and plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial function by inhibiting the opening of the mitochondrial membrane permeability transition pore (mPTP). This inhibition is achieved through its interaction with adenine nucleotide translocase-3 (ANT3), which helps prevent apoptosis and supports cell survival under stress conditions (Shen2024EFHD1).

In addition to its role in mitochondrial dynamics, EFHD1 is involved in actin-binding and bundling activities, which are modulated by calcium and zinc ions. These activities suggest a role in cytoskeletal organization and cellular structural integrity (Mun2023Structural; Mun2021Structural). EFHD1's functions are critical in processes such as neuronal differentiation and cellular response to oxidative stress, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Dütting2011Fraternal).

## Clinical Significance
EFHD1 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), EFHD1 is significantly downregulated, and its reduced expression is associated with poor pathological stages, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic marker and a target for drug development (Huang2021Identification). Conversely, in melanoma, increased EFHD1 expression correlates with shorter survival times, indicating a possible growth-promoting function in this type of cancer (Dütting2011Fraternal).

In renal cell carcinoma, EFHD1 expression is repressed, similar to the tumor suppressor HNF4α, which up-regulates EFHD1. This suggests that EFHD1 may counteract HNF4α's proliferation-suppressing effects, indicating a complex role in tumor biology (Dütting2011Fraternal). EFHD1 is also involved in reproductive biology, with altered expression observed in uterine fibroids and during pregnancy (Dütting2011Fraternal).

The gene's expression is influenced by oxidative stress-related factors, suggesting its involvement in a redox-sensitive network that controls cell survival and differentiation. In pancreatic carcinoma cells, EFHD1 expression is inversely related to SOD2 levels, indicating a potential anti-apoptotic role (Dütting2011Fraternal). These findings highlight EFHD1's diverse roles in different pathological contexts.

## Interactions
EFHD1, also known as Swiprosin-2, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. It is primarily associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane and intermembrane space, where it interacts with outer membrane proteins such as MAVS, MTCH2, and MFN2. These interactions were identified through BioID proximity ligation assays, suggesting EFHD1's role in mitochondrial dynamics and signaling pathways (Eberhardt2021EFHD1).

EFHD1 also exhibits actin-binding and bundling activities, which are modulated by calcium (Ca2+) and zinc (Zn2+) ions. It has a higher binding affinity for β-actin compared to EFhd2, independent of Ca2+, and shows Ca2+-dependent actin-bundling activity. This interaction pattern is distinct for different actin isoforms, highlighting EFHD1's role in cytoskeletal rearrangement (Mun2021Structural).

The protein's interactions are not limited to actin and mitochondrial proteins. EFHD1 is part of a redox-sensitive network, interacting with factors like SOD2 and HNF4α, which influence its expression and function in response to oxidative stress. These interactions suggest EFHD1's involvement in cell survival and differentiation processes (Dütting2011Fraternal).
