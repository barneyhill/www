# NRM

## Overview
The NRM gene encodes the protein nurim, which is a multispanning transmembrane protein localized to the inner nuclear membrane. Nurim is characterized by its unique structural features, including multiple transmembrane domains, which facilitate its integration and function within the nuclear envelope. Unlike other nuclear envelope proteins, nurim is not associated with nuclear pores or lamins, indicating a distinct role in nuclear envelope organization and dynamics (Zhang2017Isoforms; Rolls1999A). The protein exists in at least two isoforms, Nurim a and Nurim b, which differ in their transmembrane domain topology due to alternative splicing, suggesting potential functional diversity during developmental processes such as heart development (Zhang2017Isoforms). Nurim's tight association with the nuclear envelope and resistance to extraction highlight its potential structural role in maintaining nuclear integrity (Rolls1999A).

## Structure
The Nurim (NRM) protein is a nuclear envelope protein with a primary structure consisting of 262 amino acids. It features six predicted transmembrane regions, which suggest its potential role in membrane integration and function (Zhang2017Isoforms). Nurim is part of the inner nuclear membrane protein family and is not associated with nuclear pores or lamins (Zhang2017Isoforms). 

The study identifies two isoforms of Nurim, named Nurim a and Nurim b, which are generated by alternative splicing. Nurim a has a six-transmembrane domain (TMD) topology, while Nurim b has a five-TMD structure due to the absence of exon 3, which is predicted to form TMD4 (Zhang2017Isoforms). This structural difference suggests that the isoforms may have distinct functional roles during heart development. 

The tertiary structure of Nurim, while not explicitly detailed, is likely influenced by its transmembrane domains, which facilitate its integration into the nuclear envelope. The quaternary structure is not described, indicating that Nurim may function as a monomer or its interactions with other proteins are not yet characterized. The study highlights the spatiotemporal coordination of Nurim with the lamin B-binding protein LBR, suggesting a role in nuclear envelope dynamics (Zhang2017Isoforms).

## Function
The NRM gene encodes the protein nurim, which is localized to the inner nuclear membrane and plays a significant role in nuclear envelope organization. Nurim is characterized as a multispanning membrane protein with five predicted transmembrane domains, contributing to its tight association with the nuclear envelope (Rolls1999A). Unlike other nuclear envelope proteins, nurim is not associated with nuclear pores or lamins, indicating a unique mechanism for its localization and function within the nuclear envelope (Rolls1999A).

Nurim is considered one of the most tightly bound membrane proteins of the nuclear envelope, exhibiting restricted diffusion and resistance to extraction even under high salt conditions, suggesting a structural role in maintaining nuclear integrity (Rolls1999A). The protein's localization to the nuclear periphery is confirmed through immunofluorescence studies, and it is not present in the peripheral endoplasmic reticulum, further emphasizing its specific association with the nuclear envelope (Rolls1999A).

In terms of molecular processes, nurim's transmembrane domains are crucial for its targeting to the nuclear envelope, as mutations in these domains can disrupt its localization (Rolls1999A). This suggests that nurim's structure is integral to its function and localization, potentially influencing nuclear structure and function.
