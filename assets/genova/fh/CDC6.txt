# CDC6

## Overview
The CDC6 gene encodes the cell division cycle 6 protein, a pivotal regulator of DNA replication initiation in eukaryotic cells. As a member of the AAA+ ATPase family, the CDC6 protein is integral to the formation of the prereplicative complex (pre-RC) at the origins of replication during the G1 phase of the cell cycle. It functions by recruiting the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex to chromatin, thereby facilitating the assembly of the pre-RC and ensuring that DNA replication occurs precisely once per cell cycle (Yan2000PR48; Méndez2000Chromatin). The activity and stability of CDC6 are tightly regulated through phosphorylation and interactions with other cell cycle proteins, such as cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) (Petersen1999Phosphorylation). Beyond its fundamental role in cell cycle regulation, aberrant expression of CDC6 has been implicated in various cancers, where it contributes to tumor progression and poor prognosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Shen2023CDC6; Liao2024Comprehensive).

## Structure
The CDC6 protein is a member of the AAA+ superfamily, characterized by a nucleotide-binding domain with a Rossmann fold, which is crucial for its ATPase activity (Schepers2001Mutational). The primary structure of CDC6 includes conserved sequence motifs such as the Walker A and B motifs, essential for nucleotide metabolism and ATP binding (Schepers2001Mutational). The secondary structure of CDC6 is predicted to be similar to that of related archaeal proteins, featuring several beta strands (Schepers2001Mutational).

The tertiary structure of CDC6 involves the overall 3D folding necessary for its interaction with other proteins, such as the origin recognition complex (ORC) and the Mcm2-7 complex, which are critical for DNA replication initiation (Feng2021The). The winged helix domain (WHD) of CDC6 plays a significant role in DNA binding and stabilization, particularly at replication origins (Feng2021The). 

CDC6 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which regulate its activity and stability (JANG2001Identification). These modifications are crucial for its function in the cell cycle and DNA replication. The protein's quaternary structure involves interactions with other replication proteins, forming complexes essential for pre-replicative complex assembly (Feng2021The).

## Function
The CDC6 gene encodes a protein that is essential for the initiation of DNA replication in human cells. CDC6 is a key component of the prereplicative complex (pre-RC), which forms at the origin of replication during the G1 phase of the cell cycle. It plays a critical role in recruiting the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex to chromatin, a necessary step for the formation of pre-RCs and the subsequent initiation of DNA replication (Yan2000PR48; Méndez2000Chromatin).

CDC6 is regulated by E2F transcription factors, which control its expression in coordination with the cell cycle. The protein is synthesized in two peaks during the cell cycle: late mitosis and late G1, with the latter being sufficient to promote DNA replication (Hateboer1998Cell). CDC6 binds to the origin recognition complex (ORC) and facilitates the loading of MCM proteins onto chromatin, ensuring that DNA replication occurs only once per cell cycle (Méndez2000Chromatin).

The subcellular localization of CDC6 is regulated by phosphorylation. During the S phase, CDC6 is phosphorylated by cyclin A/CDK2, which promotes its translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, preventing re-replication of DNA (Petersen1999Phosphorylation). This regulation is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and ensuring proper cell cycle progression (Jiang1999Multistep).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CDC6 gene are implicated in various cancers, often correlating with poor prognosis. In skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), CDC6 is upregulated at both transcriptomic and protein levels, enhancing the proliferation, migration, and invasion of melanoma cells. This upregulation is associated with poorer outcomes in SKCM patients and suggests CDC6 as a potential therapeutic target (Liao2024Comprehensive). In breast cancer, high CDC6 expression is linked to poor prognosis and shorter survival times. It is particularly elevated in ER-negative breast cancer and is reduced by treatments like tamoxifen or letrozole, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Mahadevappa2017The).

CDC6 is also overexpressed in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), where it is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Its overexpression promotes cell proliferation and survival through pathways like CDC6-ATR-Chk1, contributing to genomic instability and oncogene activation (Shen2023CDC6). In various cancers, CDC6 represses E-cadherin transcription, facilitating epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is crucial for cancer invasion and metastasis (Sideridou2011Cdc6). These findings underscore the role of CDC6 in cancer progression and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
The CDC6 protein interacts with the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) to facilitate the initiation of DNA replication. CDC6 forms a stable complex with ORC, as demonstrated by experiments showing that CDC6 can be co-precipitated with ORC, indicating a specific and stable interaction resistant to high salt concentrations (Liang1995ORC). This interaction is crucial for the assembly of the pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) and involves the stabilization of the Orc6 TFIIB-B domain, which binds to DNA (Feng2021The).

CDC6 also interacts with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), such as Cyclin E-CDK2 and Cyclin A-CDK2, which are involved in cell cycle regulation. These interactions are stable and not mediated through nucleic acids, as shown by their stability in the presence of ethidium bromide (Saha1998Human). The binding of cyclin A-CDK2 to ORC1 during the G1-S phase transition dissociates ORC1 from CDC6, targeting ORC1 for degradation (Hossain2021Multiple).

In addition to its interactions with ORC and CDKs, CDC6 is involved in a liquid phase transition on DNA, which helps regulate the levels of nuclear ORC1 (Hossain2021Multiple). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of CDC6 in DNA replication and cell cycle regulation.
