# DOCK4

## Overview
DOCK4, or dedicator of cytokinesis 4, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the dedicator of cytokinesis (DOCK) family, specifically categorized as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). The DOCK4 protein plays a pivotal role in cellular processes by facilitating the activation of small GTPases, such as Rac1 and Rap1, which are essential for cytoskeletal reorganization and cell migration (McNally2020Upregulated). Structurally, DOCK4 contains several conserved domains, including an N-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domain and two DOCK homology regions (DHR-1 and DHR-2), which are crucial for its function and interactions with other proteins (Benson2021The; Herbst2024Heterozygous). The protein is involved in maintaining cellular architecture and intercellular junction formation, impacting tissue development and immune responses (Yu2015TGFβSmad). Clinically, mutations in the DOCK4 gene have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and dyslexia, highlighting its significance in neural development and function (Pagnamenta2010Characterization; Huang2020Two).

## Structure
DOCK4 is a member of the dedicator of cytokinesis (DOCK) protein family, specifically belonging to the DOCK-B subfamily. It features several conserved domains, including an N-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, two DOCK homology regions (DHR-1 and DHR-2), and a proline-rich C-terminal region (Benson2021The; Herbst2024Heterozygous). The DHR-1 domain is involved in membrane localization through interaction with phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3), while the DHR-2 domain is crucial for binding and activating RAC1, a small Rho GTPase (Benson2021The; Huang2020Two). The SH3 domain interacts with ELMO proteins, which are necessary for DOCK GEF activity (Benson2021The).

DOCK4 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in isoforms such as DOCK4-Ex49, which lacks exon 49 and is expressed in specific tissues like the brain and eye (Yan2006An). This isoform retains the ability to bind nucleotide-free Rac as effectively as the wild-type DOCK4, indicating that the splice variation does not affect the binding ability via the DHR2 domain (Yan2006An). The C-terminal proline-rich region may contain linear motifs for post-translational modifications or protein-protein interactions (Herbst2024Heterozygous).

## Function
DOCK4 (dedicator of cytokinesis 4) is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that primarily facilitates the activation of small GTPases, such as Rac1 and Rap1, which are crucial for cytoskeletal reorganization and cell migration. In healthy human cells, DOCK4 is involved in cell signaling pathways that activate RhoGTPases, necessary for the assembly of cell attachment sites, which are integral to cell migration and invasion (McNally2020Upregulated). It is a membrane-associated protein that enhances the formation of adherens junctions between cells, playing a significant role in maintaining cellular architecture and intercellular junction formation (McNally2020Upregulated).

DOCK4 is active in the cytoplasm and is involved in processes like cell signaling and maintaining cellular architecture, impacting tissue development and immune responses. Its role in cell biology includes promoting cell adhesion and migration, which are essential for normal tissue development and repair. The protein's activity in the cytoplasm and its involvement in these molecular processes contribute to the proper functioning of cellular and organismal systems, ensuring effective communication and structural integrity within tissues (Yu2015TGFβSmad).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DOCK4 gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. Variations in DOCK4, such as deletions and missense mutations, have been linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and dyslexia. These mutations disrupt the gene's function in activating Rac1 and Rap1 GTPases, which are crucial for neurite outgrowth and synapse development, leading to impairments in social communication and reading abilities (Huang2020Two).

In studies involving Dock4 knockout mice, a deficiency in DOCK4 resulted in ASD-like behaviors, including impaired social interactions, abnormal vocalizations, and learning deficits. These behaviors were associated with reduced excitatory synaptic transmission and decreased spine density in the hippocampus (Guo2019Autismlike).

Heterozygous loss-of-function variants in DOCK4 have been linked to neurodevelopmental delay and microcephaly. Individuals with these variants exhibit a range of symptoms, including developmental delays, coordination abnormalities, and seizures. The study suggests an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance for these conditions, with males often more severely affected than females (Herbst2024Heterozygous).

Additionally, rare deletions in DOCK4 have been identified in families with autism and dyslexia, suggesting that these genetic alterations may serve as risk factors for these conditions (Pagnamenta2010Characterization).

## Interactions
DOCK4 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular signaling and cytoskeletal organization. It is identified as an unconventional guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the Rho family of GTPases, particularly Rac, and interacts with harmonin, a PDZ domain-containing protein involved in actin cytoskeleton regulation (Yan2006An). This interaction is crucial in the inner ear's stereocilia, suggesting a signaling pathway involving Rac, DOCK4, and harmonin (Yan2006An).

DOCK4 also interacts with cortactin, a protein that regulates actin polymerization and stabilization, which is essential for dendritic spine formation in neurons. This interaction occurs through the C-terminal, proline-rich region of DOCK4 and the SH3 domain of cortactin, highlighting its role in spine formation and maintenance (Ueda2013Rac).

In cancer cell lines, DOCK4 mutations can alter its guanine nucleotide releasing properties, affecting its interactions with proteins like Crk and influencing cell migration and invasion (Feller2006Potential). DOCK4 is also involved in the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway, promoting metastasis in lung adenocarcinoma by enhancing Rac1 activation (Yu2015TGFβSmad).
