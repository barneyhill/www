# PRAMEF25

## Overview
PRAMEF25, or Preferentially Expressed Antigen in Melanoma Family Member 25, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the PRAME (Preferentially Expressed Antigen in Melanoma) family. This family of proteins is characterized by their role in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation and immune response modulation. PRAMEF25 is particularly noted for its expression in certain cancer types, where it may contribute to tumorigenic processes by influencing pathways related to cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. The protein encoded by PRAMEF25 is not classified as a kinase, receptor, or transmembrane protein, but rather as a member of a family known for its involvement in cancer biology (Qiu2020aarFDC).
