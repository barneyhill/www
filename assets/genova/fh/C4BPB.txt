# C4BPB

## Overview
The C4BPB gene encodes the beta-chain of the complement component 4 binding protein (C4BP), a key regulator within the complement system, which is an integral part of the innate immune response. The protein encoded by C4BPB is categorized as a complement control protein and plays a pivotal role in modulating the classical and lectin pathways of the complement system. The beta-chain, characterized by its three complement control protein (CCP) domains, is essential for the formation of a high-affinity complex with protein S, a vitamin K-dependent protein, thereby localizing complement regulatory activity to cell membranes, particularly those with negatively charged phospholipids such as apoptotic cells (Blom2004Complement). This interaction is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis by preventing excessive inflammation and tissue damage. The C4BP complex, which includes multiple alpha-chains and a unique beta-chain, is vital for the regulation of immune responses and has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including venous thrombosis and pregnancy complications (Buil2010C4BPBC4BPA; Mohlin2013Analysis).

## Structure
The C4BPB gene encodes the beta-chain of the complement component 4 binding protein (C4BP), which is a crucial regulator of the complement system. The beta-chain is composed of three complement control protein (CCP) domains, also known as Sushi domains, each approximately 60 amino acids in length (Rezende2004Coagulation; Villoutreix1999The). The primary structure of the beta-chain includes 235 amino acid residues and features five potential glycosylation sites, contributing to its molecular weight of approximately 45 kDa (Villoutreix1999The).

The secondary structure of the beta-chain is primarily composed of beta strands, with the non-repeat regions being mostly helical (Villoutreix1998Structural). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these CCP domains into a compact, globular form, characterized by a conserved hydrophobic core and disulfide bridges that stabilize the structure (Villoutreix1999The).

In terms of quaternary structure, the beta-chain forms part of the larger C4BP complex, typically consisting of seven alpha-chains and one beta-chain, creating a spider-like structure held together by disulfide bonds (Rezende2004Coagulation). The beta-chain contains a high-affinity binding site for protein S, primarily located on the CCP1 domain, which is crucial for its interaction with protein S (Serrano2022The; Blom2004Complement).

## Function
C4BPB, or complement component 4 binding protein beta, is a crucial component of the complement system, which is part of the innate immune response. It forms a complex with C4BPA, primarily functioning in the plasma and on cell surfaces to regulate the classical and lectin pathways of the complement system. This regulation is achieved by binding to the complement component C4b, preventing its interaction with C2a, and promoting its degradation. This process helps to prevent excessive inflammation and tissue damage, maintaining immune homeostasis (Blom2004Complement).

The C4BP complex, which includes C4BPB, is composed of multiple identical α-chains and a unique β-chain. The β-chain is essential for forming a high-affinity complex with protein S, a vitamin K-dependent protein. This complex is significant for localizing complement regulatory activity to cell membranes, particularly those with negatively charged phospholipids, such as apoptotic cells (Blom2004Complement). The β-chain is not required for the polymerization of the α-chains but is crucial for the complex's function in the immune system. The presence of C4BPB in the complex allows it to interact with various cellular targets, contributing to its role in immune regulation and homeostasis (Blom2004Complement).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the C4BPB gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions. The C4BPB/C4BPA locus has been identified as a new susceptibility factor for venous thrombosis (VT). Genome-wide association studies have shown that specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in this region are associated with increased risk of VT, suggesting a mechanism independent of protein S, a known anticoagulant (Buil2010C4BPBC4BPA).

In the context of idiopathic recurrent spontaneous pregnancy loss (RSPL), genetic studies have identified rare mutations in the C4BPB gene. Although these mutations were not statistically significant in association with RSPL, they highlight the potential role of complement regulation in pregnancy complications (Mohlin2013Analysis).

The C4BPB gene has also been investigated for its potential association with schizophrenia. However, studies have found no significant link between common variants in C4BPB and schizophrenia in the Han Chinese population, suggesting that C4BPB may not be a major contributor to schizophrenia risk in this demographic (Wang2015An). These findings underscore the complex role of C4BPB in various diseases, necessitating further research to fully understand its clinical significance.
