# TENT2

## Overview
TENT2, or terminal nucleotidyltransferase 2, is a gene that encodes a non-canonical poly(A) polymerase protein involved in the post-transcriptional modification of RNA. This enzyme plays a crucial role in RNA metabolism by adding nucleotides to the 3' ends of RNA molecules, thereby influencing their stability and translation. TENT2 is particularly significant in the polyadenylation of mRNAs and the tailing of microRNAs (miRNAs), processes that are essential for the regulation of gene expression and RNA stability in human cells (Warkocki2018Terminal; Yang2022TENT2). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and interacts with various RNA-binding proteins to modulate RNA processing and function. Despite its important roles, TENT2 knockout mice do not show a clear phenotype, indicating potential compensatory mechanisms by other proteins (Warkocki2018Terminal).

## Function
TENT2, also known as terminal nucleotidyltransferase 2, is a non-canonical poly(A) polymerase involved in the post-transcriptional modification of RNA in healthy human cells. It primarily functions in the polyadenylation of mRNAs, which stabilizes them and enhances their translation. This process is mediated by the QKI-7 protein, which binds to mRNAs and recruits TENT2 for polyadenylation (Warkocki2018Terminal). TENT2 also plays a role in the regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) by adding adenine, uracil, and guanine nucleotides to their 3' ends, a process known as miRNA tailing. This modification can affect the stability and function of miRNAs, with TENT2-mediated adenylation stabilizing certain miRNAs in a context-dependent manner (Yang2022TENT2).

In the liver, TENT2 enhances the stability of miRNA-122, which is crucial for liver development and metabolism (Liudkovska2020Functions). Despite its significant roles in RNA metabolism, TENT2 knockout mice do not exhibit a discernible phenotype, suggesting that other proteins or mechanisms may compensate for its functions (Warkocki2018Terminal). TENT2 is active in the cytoplasm and is involved in maintaining RNA integrity and regulating gene expression in human cells (Liudkovska2020Functions).

## Interactions
TENT2, also known as terminal nucleotidyltransferase 2, participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in RNA metabolism. In Xenopus laevis oocytes, TENT2 is involved in cytoplasmic polyadenylation, where it interacts with CPE-binding protein 1 (CPEB1), cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF), and the scaffolding protein symplekin. This complex formation is crucial for regulating mRNA translation by modulating poly(A) tail length (Yu2020A; Liudkovska2020Functions).

TENT2 also interacts with poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) and maskin, where maskin binds to eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), inhibiting translation initiation. Upon developmental cues, phosphorylation of CPEB1 leads to the dissociation of PARN, allowing TENT2 to elongate the poly(A) tail, facilitating translation activation (Yu2020A).

In mammals, TENT2 is expressed in the brain and interacts with RNA-binding proteins like QKI-7 to target specific mRNAs for polyadenylation, such as hnRNPA1, p27, and β-catenin mRNAs in HEK293 cells (Liudkovska2020Functions). TENT2 also plays a role in miRNA stability, where it competes with TUT4 and TUT7 for access to miRNA 3' ends, influencing miRNA tailing and stability (Yang2022TENT2).
