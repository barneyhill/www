# FGFR4

## Overview
FGFR4, or fibroblast growth factor receptor 4, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor, which is part of the fibroblast growth factor receptor family. The FGFR4 protein plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including the regulation of bile acid synthesis and cholesterol metabolism, primarily in the liver. It is activated by fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19), leading to downstream signaling pathways that modulate metabolic functions (Triantis2010Glycosylation; Yu2005Independent). Structurally, FGFR4 is characterized by an extracellular region with three immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane region, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain, which is essential for its signaling capabilities (Lang2019Fibroblast). FGFR4's interactions with various proteins influence cellular processes such as endocytosis and tumor cell invasion, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and pathological conditions, including cancer (Sugiyama2010FGF; Haugsten2016Proximity).

## Structure
The FGFR4 protein is a member of the fibroblast growth factor receptor family and is characterized by a tyrosine kinase domain. The primary structure of FGFR4 consists of 802 amino acids, organized into distinct regions: a signal peptide (1-21 aa), an extracellular region, a transmembrane region (70-390 aa), and an intracellular region (391-802 aa) (Lang2019Fibroblast). The extracellular region contains three immunoglobulin-like domains (IgI, IgII, and IgIII), which are crucial for ligand binding. These domains are located at positions 50-107 aa, 157-241 aa, and 264-351 aa, respectively (Lang2019Fibroblast).

The intracellular region includes the tyrosine kinase domain, spanning from 454-767 aa, with key tyrosine residues (Y642, Y643, and Y764) involved in autocatalysis (Lang2019Fibroblast). FGFR4 undergoes phosphorylation as a common post-translational modification, which is essential for its signaling function (Lang2019Fibroblast).

FGFR4 forms a homodimer upon ligand binding, which is part of its quaternary structure, facilitating the activation of downstream signaling pathways (Lang2019Fibroblast). The protein does not have a splice variant on the IgIII domain, indicating a level of structural consistency in this region (Lang2019Fibroblast).

## Function
FGFR4 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 4) is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor that plays a significant role in regulating bile acid synthesis and cholesterol metabolism in the liver. It is primarily expressed in mature hepatocytes and is activated by fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19), which is produced in the terminal ileum and reaches the liver via the portal circulation (Triantis2010Glycosylation; Yu2005Independent). Upon activation, FGFR4 down-regulates the expression of cytochrome P450 7A1 (CYP7A1), a rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid synthesis, by activating the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. This regulation is crucial for maintaining optimal bile flow and preventing cholestasis (Triantis2010Glycosylation).

FGFR4's activity is modulated by b-Klotho, which affects the cellular abundance of different FGFR4 glycoforms. Only the fully glycosylated FGFR4 is active in CYP7A1 down-regulation, indicating that glycosylation is essential for FGF19 activity and regulation of bile acid synthesis (Triantis2010Glycosylation). FGFR4 also plays a role in the repression of bile acid synthesis through the c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway, although it is not required for JNK activation by bile acids (Yu2005Independent). This receptor is involved in maintaining cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis, and its disruption can lead to metabolic imbalances (Yu2000Elevated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FGFR4 gene are implicated in various cancers. FGFR4 gene alterations, such as amplifications and mutations, are linked to tumorigenesis and cancer progression. In a study of 4853 solid tumors, FGFR4 gene alterations were found in 7.1% of cases, predominantly as gene amplifications (78%) (Lang2019Fibroblast). Specific mutations, such as K535 and E550, have been identified in rhabdomyosarcoma, contributing to increased autophosphorylation and activation of downstream signaling pathways like Stat3, which promote tumor proliferation and metastasis (Dienstmann2014Genomic; VI2009Identification).

The FGFR4 Gly388Arg polymorphism is associated with increased cancer risks, particularly in breast and prostate cancers, and is linked to more aggressive clinical behavior in various cancers, including sarcoma and melanoma (Xu2010FGFR4; NakanoTateno2014FGFR4). In breast cancer, FGFR4 amplification is often associated with estrogen and progesterone receptors and lymph-node metastases (Lang2019Fibroblast).

FGFR4 overexpression is reported in hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, and other cancers, contributing to increased cell proliferation and survival through pathways like PI3K-AKT and MEK-ERK (Lang2019Fibroblast). The FGF19-FGFR4 axis is also involved in chemotherapy resistance, with FGFR4 expression linked to drug resistance in breast and colorectal cancers (Lang2019Fibroblast).

## Interactions
FGFR4 interacts with several proteins, influencing various cellular processes. One significant interaction is with membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP). The FGFR4-R388 variant forms a complex with MT1-MMP, leading to increased MT1-MMP activity and enhanced collagen invasion, which is crucial for tumor cell invasion. This interaction involves the tyrosyl phosphorylation of MT1-MMP, which stabilizes and enhances its activity. In contrast, the FGFR4-G388 variant down-regulates MT1-MMP activity (Sugiyama2010FGF).

FGFR4 also participates in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a process essential for its internalization and proper signaling. This involves interactions with clathrin and dynamin, as demonstrated by increased FGFR4 levels at the cell surface when clathrin heavy chain is knocked down. This endocytosis is crucial for maintaining receptor levels and signaling accuracy (Haugsten2016Proximity).

Additionally, FGFR4 interacts with proteins involved in intracellular transport and recycling, such as Rab11 effectors and TGN46, indicating its role in endosomal transport and recycling pathways. These interactions help FGFR4 bypass lysosomal degradation, contributing to prolonged signaling (Haugsten2016Proximity).
