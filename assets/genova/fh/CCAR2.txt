# CCAR2

## Overview
CCAR2, also known as DBC1 (Deleted in Breast Cancer 1), is a gene that encodes the protein cell cycle and apoptosis regulator 2, a nuclear multidomain protein involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, DNA damage response, and apoptosis. The protein is characterized by its intrinsic disorder and contains several functional domains, such as an S1-like RNA-binding domain, a Nudix homology domain, and a coiled-coil domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids (Lugano2024Multifaceted; Kim2023Mechanistic). CCAR2 plays a dual role in cancer biology, acting as both a tumor suppressor and promoter, depending on the cellular context. It interacts with key proteins such as SIRT1, PARP1, and p53, influencing pathways related to apoptosis and DNA repair (Lugano2024Multifaceted; Kim2023Mechanistic). Additionally, CCAR2 is implicated in the regulation of nuclear receptors and Wnt signaling, contributing to its complex role in tumorigenesis (Johnson2020CCAR1; Kim2023Mechanistic).

## Structure
CCAR2, also known as DBC1, is a nuclear multidomain protein composed of 923 amino acids. It features several key domains, including an S1-like RNA-binding domain, a nuclear localization signal (NLS), a leucine zipper (LZ) motif, a Nudix homology domain (NHD), an EF-hand domain, and a coiled-coil domain (Lugano2024Multifaceted; Kim2023Mechanistic). The S1-like domain is crucial for binding to transcription factors and coregulators, and it suggests potential interactions with RNA (Kim2023Mechanistic). The LZ domain is involved in interactions with NFÎºB family members (Lugano2024Multifaceted).

CCAR2 is intrinsically disordered, with over 40% of its residues being disordered, allowing for structural flexibility and frequent sites of protein interactions and post-translational modifications (Lugano2024Multifaceted; Kim2023Mechanistic). Post-translational modifications include phosphorylation by ATM/ATR at Thr454, acetylation by hMOF at K112 and K215, and sumoylation at K591 by SUMO2/3 and PIAS3 E3 ligases (Lugano2024Multifaceted). These modifications can alter its function, such as increasing or disrupting SIRT1 binding (Lugano2024Multifaceted). The protein's structure and flexibility are crucial for its role in transcriptional regulation and interaction with various cellular components.

## Clinical Significance
CCAR2, also known as DBC1, plays a complex role in cancer, acting as both a tumor suppressor and promoter depending on the context. Alterations in CCAR2 expression or function are linked to various cancers, including breast, prostate, colorectal, and non-small cell lung cancer. In breast cancer, CCAR2 acts as a coactivator for oncogenic transcription factors, promoting tumorigenesis and cancer progression, and is associated with worsened relapse-free survival in both ERÎ±-positive and ERÎ±-negative patients (Kim2023Mechanistic). In prostate cancer, particularly castration-resistant prostate cancer, CCAR2 enhances androgen receptor transcriptional activity, contributing to cancer progression (Kim2023Mechanistic). In colorectal cancer, CCAR2 is integral to Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling, promoting cancer progression and metastasis (Kim2023Mechanistic).

CCAR2's role in DNA damage response and repair pathways also influences cancer development. It regulates DNA double-strand break repair, promoting nonhomologous end joining and limiting homologous recombination, which is crucial for maintaining genomic integrity (Lugano2024Multifaceted). Mutations or altered expression of CCAR2 can lead to genomic instability and influence cancer cell sensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents and PARP inhibitors, particularly in BRCA1/2-deficient cancers (Lugano2024Multifaceted).

## Interactions
CCAR2, also known as DBC1, is a nuclear multidomain protein that participates in numerous interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It contains several functional domains, including an S1-like RNA-binding domain, a Nudix homology domain, and a coiled-coil domain, which facilitate its interactions (Lugano2024Multifaceted; Kim2023Mechanistic).

CCAR2 interacts with SIRT1, inhibiting its deacetylase activity, which leads to the acetylation and activation of p53, promoting apoptosis (Lugano2024Multifaceted; Kim2023Mechanistic). It also binds to and inhibits PARP1, affecting DNA damage response and repair (Lugano2024Multifaceted; Kim2023Mechanistic). CCAR2 stabilizes p53 by competing with MDM2, preventing its degradation and promoting p53-dependent apoptosis (Lugano2024Multifaceted; Kim2023Mechanistic).

In cancer contexts, CCAR2 interacts with nuclear receptors such as ERÎ± and AR, enhancing their transcriptional activity and stability, which is significant in breast and prostate cancers (Lugano2024Multifaceted; Kim2023Mechanistic). It also binds to Î²-catenin, influencing Wnt signaling pathways (Johnson2020CCAR1). CCAR2's interactions with various proteins underscore its dual role in tumorigenesis, acting as both a tumor suppressor and promoter depending on the context (Kim2023Mechanistic).
