# TOP3B

## Overview
The TOP3B gene encodes DNA topoisomerase III beta, a type IA topoisomerase enzyme that plays a pivotal role in maintaining genomic stability by resolving topological constraints in nucleic acids. This enzyme is unique among vertebrate topoisomerases due to its ability to act on both DNA and RNA substrates, a feature facilitated by its C-terminal RGG domain (GotoIto2017Structural). The protein is involved in critical cellular processes such as replication, transcription, recombination, and chromatin remodeling, and it is essential for the DNA damage response and repair mechanisms (Saha2020DNA; Zhang2019Loss). TOP3B forms a complex with the TDRD3 auxiliary factor, enhancing its catalytic activity and enabling its recruitment to chromatin and RNA (GotoIto2017Structural; Yang2022Structural). Mutations in the TOP3B gene have been associated with various clinical conditions, including cancer predisposition and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its significance in both genomic integrity and neurological function (Ahmad2016Topoisomerase; Zhang2019Loss).

## Structure
The human TOP3B protein is a type IA topoisomerase characterized by a toroidal-shaped topoisomerase domain (TOPO domain), which is divided into four subdomains (I-IV) (GotoIto2017Structural). This domain forms a Mg2+-bound catalytic pocket essential for its enzymatic activity. The protein also contains five zinc-finger domains (ZF domains) and an RGG domain, which are crucial for its function and interaction with nucleic acids (GotoIto2017Structural).

The secondary structure of TOP3B includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of topoisomerases, contributing to its three-dimensional folding. The tertiary structure involves the arrangement of these domains to facilitate its catalytic function, particularly in cleaving and rejoining DNA and RNA strands (Yang2022Structural).

In terms of quaternary structure, TOP3B forms a complex with the TDRD3 auxiliary factor, which enhances its catalytic activity. The interaction between TOP3B and TDRD3 is mediated by the core and loop regions of TDRD3, with specific hydrophobic interactions being essential for this binding (GotoIto2017Structural; Yang2022Structural).

TOP3B is unique in its ability to recognize both DNA and RNA substrates, a feature attributed to its C-terminal RGG domain, which binds RNA with higher affinity (GotoIto2017Structural). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions. Additionally, alternative splicing may result in different isoforms of TOP3B, although specific isoforms are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
The TOP3B gene encodes for DNA topoisomerase III beta, an enzyme that plays a crucial role in maintaining genome stability by resolving topological constraints during nucleic acid processes such as replication, transcription, recombination, chromosome segregation, and chromatin remodeling (Saha2020DNA; Saha2023The). TOP3B is unique among vertebrate topoisomerases as it can act on both DNA and RNA, participating in their metabolic processes (Saha2023The). It helps decrease cellular R-loops by relaxing hypernegative supercoils or resolving R-loops in coordination with the helicase DDX5, which is important for transcription in cancer cells and neuronal activity-dependent transcription in mouse brain tissue (Saha2023The).

In healthy human cells, TOP3B is involved in the DNA damage response and repair mechanisms, coordinating the repair of DNA damage and the activation of cell cycle checkpoints (Zhang2019Loss). It is also implicated in neurogenesis, with disruptions linked to neural defects and predispositions to conditions like autism and schizophrenia (Zhang2019Loss). The enzyme is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, with a higher abundance in the cytosol, facilitating DNA and RNA metabolic processes (Saha2020Topoisomerase). In the nucleus, TOP3B, in association with the scaffolding protein TDRD3, is recruited to promoter regions of target genes, where it aids in transcription by relaxing supercoiled DNA and resolving R-loops (Saha2020Topoisomerase).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TOP3B gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. Loss of TOP3B function leads to increased R-loop formation, resulting in genome instability, DNA damage, and chromosomal mis-segregation, which are associated with cancer predisposition. A notable case involved a patient with bilateral renal cancer who had a homozygous deletion of the TOP3B gene (Zhang2019Loss). Although TOP3B mutations contribute to genome instability, they do not typically lead to early-onset cancers, unlike mutations in the BLM gene associated with Bloom syndrome. Instead, individuals with TOP3B mutations may develop cancers later in life (Zhang2019Loss).

TOP3B is also implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. Mutations such as R472Q and C666R have been identified in patients with schizophrenia and autism, respectively. These mutations disrupt the protein's normal interactions with FMRP and TDRD3, affecting synapse formation and potentially contributing to mental dysfunctions (Ahmad2016Topoisomerase). Additionally, TOP3B genetic inactivation has been linked to cognitive impairments and behavior defects (Saha2020DNA). The gene's role in both DNA and RNA processes underscores its importance in maintaining genomic stability and proper cellular function.

## Interactions
TOP3B (DNA topoisomerase III beta) is involved in several critical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It forms a heterotrimeric complex with TDRD3 and FMRP, known as the TTF complex, which is crucial for its function in RNA metabolism and mRNA translation regulation (GotoIto2017Structural; Saha2023The). TDRD3 stabilizes TOP3B by recruiting the deubiquitinase USP9X, which counteracts the ubiquitylation mediated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase MIB1, thereby preventing its proteasomal degradation (Saha2023The). 

TOP3B also interacts with TRIM41, another E3 ligase, which specifically ubiquitylates TOP3B cleavage complexes (TOP3Bccs) on DNA and RNA, facilitating their repair and preventing cellular damage (Saha2023The; Saha2020Topoisomerase). The interaction with TDRD3 is mediated through the DUF-OB fold domain of TDRD3, which binds to single-stranded DNA or RNA, enhancing TOP3B's topoisomerase activities and targeting it to chromatin and RNA (GotoIto2017Structural; Yang2014Arginine). 

TOP3B is also associated with polyribosomes and RNA stress granules, promoting the translation of specific RNAs in cancer cells and neurons, and stabilizing a subset of RNAs through a topoisomerase-independent mechanism (Saha2023The).
