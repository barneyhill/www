# TPH2

## Overview
The TPH2 gene encodes the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase 2, which is a critical component in the biosynthesis of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that plays a vital role in regulating mood, emotion, and various physiological processes. Tryptophan hydroxylase 2 is categorized as a hydroxylase enzyme and is primarily expressed in the central nervous system, particularly within serotonergic neurons of the raphe nuclei (Chen2012Advances; Waløen2016Tyrosine). The enzyme catalyzes the conversion of L-tryptophan to 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan, representing the rate-limiting step in serotonin production (Waløen2016Tyrosine). TPH2's activity is modulated by various factors, including phosphorylation and interactions with cofactors such as Fe2+ and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) (Kuhn2020Tryptophan; Zhang2005Functional). Mutations and polymorphisms in the TPH2 gene have been associated with several psychiatric disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in mental health (Kulikova2019Tryptophan; Haavik2008Mutations).

## Structure
Tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) is a crucial enzyme in serotonin biosynthesis, primarily found in the brain. The primary structure of TPH2 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form distinct domains: an N-terminal regulatory domain, a central catalytic domain, and a C-terminal oligomerization domain (Pereira2020In). The secondary structure of TPH2 is characterized by 17 helices and 4 β sheets, with Fe2+ and imidazole as cofactors (Zhu2022CryoEM).

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains, with the catalytic domain containing a 2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad crucial for binding catalytic iron (Zhu2022CryoEM). The regulatory domain includes an ACT domain with a βαββαβ topology, which is common in proteins involved in amino acid metabolism (Vedel2022Structural).

In terms of quaternary structure, TPH2 forms a tetramer, which is essential for its enzymatic activity. This tetramer is assembled through dimers of dimers, with the C-terminal domain playing a key role in oligomerization (Zhu2022CryoEM; Tidemand2016Stabilization). The oligomeric state is crucial for TPH2 function, with specific interactions at the A/B and A/C interfaces involving multiple helices and β sheets (Zhu2022CryoEM).

TPH2 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in isoforms such as TPH2b, which includes a novel 6 bp insertion affecting the hinge region between the regulatory and catalytic domains (Grohmann2010Alternative). This splicing event may impact the enzyme's activity and stability. Common post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are also relevant to TPH2's function and regulation (Vedel2022Structural).

## Function
The TPH2 gene encodes the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase 2, which is crucial for the synthesis of serotonin (5-HT) in the brain. TPH2 catalyzes the conversion of L-tryptophan to 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan, the rate-limiting step in serotonin production (Chen2012Advances; Waløen2016Tyrosine). This enzyme is primarily expressed in serotonergic neurons of the central nervous system, particularly in the raphe nuclei, and is essential for maintaining normal mood and emotional states (Zhang2005Functional; Waløen2016Tyrosine).

TPH2 activity is regulated by various factors, including calcium and phosphorylation through protein kinases, which modulate its function in response to extracellular stimuli (Invernizzi2007Role; Kuhn2020Tryptophan). The enzyme's activity is also influenced by molecular oxygen and cofactors such as Fe2+ and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), which are necessary for its catalytic function (Kuhn2020Tryptophan; Zhang2005Functional).

In healthy human cells, TPH2 plays a significant role in modulating serotonin neurotransmission, impacting behaviors such as mood, stress response, and autonomic control (Chen2012Advances; Waløen2016Tyrosine). Its expression is sensitive to environmental factors, including stress and hormonal changes, which can alter serotonin synthesis and influence neuropsychiatric health (Chen2012Advances).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TPH2 gene are linked to several psychiatric disorders. The R441H mutation in humans, a rare missense mutation, is associated with severe, treatment-resistant unipolar depression. This mutation results in reduced TPH2 activity, leading to decreased serotonin levels and increased depressive-like behaviors (Kulikova2019Tryptophan; Haavik2008Mutations). In animal models, the equivalent R439H mutation in mice also results in reduced serotonin synthesis and is linked to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)-like behaviors (Kulikova2019Tryptophan).

Polymorphisms in the TPH2 gene, such as the G-703T variant, have been associated with changes in brain structure and function, affecting emotional and cognitive processing. This variant is linked to increased amygdala responsiveness and altered emotional regulation, particularly when combined with early-life stress (Spagnolo2020Effects). Other polymorphisms, like rs11178997, reduce TPH2 transcriptional activity and are associated with anxiety disorders, major depression, and suicide attempts (Scheuch2007Characterization).

Alterations in TPH2 expression levels are also implicated in psychiatric conditions. Elevated TPH2 mRNA expression has been observed in the brains of depressed individuals, suggesting a compensatory response to deficient serotonin neurotransmission (Chen2012Advances).

## Interactions
Tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) is involved in several interactions that are crucial for its function in serotonin biosynthesis. TPH2 interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, which are a family of conserved proteins that bind to phosphorylated serine/threonine residues on target proteins. This interaction is significant for the activation and stabilization of TPH2. Specifically, TPH2 is phosphorylated at Ser19 by CaM-KII and PKA, which promotes its association with 14-3-3 proteins. This binding not only activates TPH2 but also inhibits its dephosphorylation, thereby prolonging the activation signal (Waløen2016Tyrosine).

TPH2 also forms oligomeric structures, which are essential for its enzymatic activity. The tetrameric conformation of TPH2 involves two types of interfaces: the A/B interface, characterized by a leucine zipper-like motif, and the A/C interface, which is stabilized by nonbonded contacts such as hydrophobic effects and van der Waals forces (Zhu2022CryoEM). These interactions are critical for maintaining the structural integrity and function of TPH2. Mutations in key residues involved in these interfaces can lead to disorders like depression and autism by affecting TPH2 stability and function (Zhu2022CryoEM).
