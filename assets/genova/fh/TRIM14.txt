# TRIM14

## Overview
TRIM14 is a gene that encodes the protein tripartite motif containing 14, which is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family. This protein is characterized by its unique domain architecture, including a B-box, a coiled-coil region, and a C-terminal B30.2/SPRY domain, but notably lacks the RING domain typically associated with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (Wang2016TRIM14; Hatakeyama2017TRIM). TRIM14 plays a significant role in the immune response and cellular signaling pathways, particularly in the regulation of the cGAS/STING and NF-κB signaling pathways, which are crucial for antiviral defense and endothelial activation, respectively (Di2020TRIM; Huang2019TRIM14). Additionally, TRIM14 is involved in cellular differentiation and has been implicated in various cancers, where it influences tumor progression and resistance mechanisms (Nenasheva2013Trim14; Tan2018TRIM14; Eberhardt2020Multifaceted). Through its interactions with other proteins, TRIM14 modulates immune responses and inhibits viral replication, underscoring its multifaceted role in cellular processes (Tan2017Assembly; Wu2019Inhibition).

## Structure
TRIM14 is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family, characterized by its unique domain architecture. Unlike most TRIM proteins, TRIM14 lacks the RING domain, which is typically associated with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (Wang2016TRIM14). Instead, TRIM14 contains a B-box, a coiled-coil region, and a C-terminal B30.2/SPRY domain, also known as the PRYSPRY domain (Wang2016TRIM14; Hatakeyama2017TRIM).

The PRYSPRY domain of TRIM14 has been structurally characterized as a highly distorted and globular beta-sandwich structure, composed of two antiparallel beta-sheets and an additional alpha-helix (Yu2019The). This domain features a positively charged surface, which facilitates interactions with acidic peptides, and is crucial for TRIM14's role in protein-protein interactions (Yu2019The). The electropositive pocket of the PRYSPRY domain is deeper and larger than that of similar domains in other proteins, suggesting a specific affinity for motifs rich in acidic amino acids (Yu2019The).

TRIM14's coiled-coil domain is involved in homo-interactions and the formation of high molecular weight complexes, contributing to its stability and function (Wang2016TRIM14). The B-box domains, particularly the Type 2 B-box, are important for forming homo-multimers and interacting with other proteins (Wang2016TRIM14).

## Function
TRIM14 is involved in several key molecular processes in healthy human cells, primarily related to the immune response and cellular signaling pathways. It plays a crucial role in the regulation of the cGAS/STING signaling pathway, which is essential for detecting cytosolic DNA during pathogen replication or organelle damage. TRIM14 enhances the activity of this pathway by preventing the autophagic degradation of cGAS, thereby maintaining its stability and function, which is particularly important in viral infections (Di2020TRIM).

TRIM14 also promotes endothelial activation through the NF-κB signaling pathway. It enhances the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, facilitating the translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus, which leads to gene transcription. This process is crucial for endothelial cell function and the immune response, as demonstrated by its role in the expression of adhesion molecules and cytokines in endothelial cells (Huang2019TRIM14).

In addition to its role in immune signaling, TRIM14 is involved in cellular differentiation. Overexpression of TRIM14 in embryonic stem cells leads to transcriptional changes that promote mesodermal differentiation while inhibiting ectodermal differentiation, suggesting its involvement in early stages of stem cell differentiation (Nenasheva2013Trim14).

## Clinical Significance
TRIM14 is implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression and interactions. In gliomas, TRIM14 is overexpressed, contributing to chemoresistance by stabilizing Dishevelled 2 (Dvl2), which activates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This leads to increased expression of MGMT, a factor in temozolomide resistance, and is associated with poor prognosis (Tan2018TRIM14). In colorectal cancer (CRC), TRIM14 is upregulated and linked to poor patient survival. It activates the PI3K/Akt and STAT3 signaling pathways, promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. TRIM14 enhances PI3K signaling by degrading PTEN and induces STAT3 activation through sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1), leading to the expression of tumor-promoting genes (Eberhardt2020Multifaceted). In atherosclerosis, TRIM14 is upregulated in endothelial cells, promoting activation through the NF-κB signaling pathway. This involves the interaction with NEMO and TAK1, amplifying inflammatory signals and contributing to disease progression (Huang2019TRIM14). In thyroid cancer, TRIM14 is upregulated in papillary thyroid carcinoma, where its knockdown inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis by affecting SOCS1 ubiquitination, a negative regulator of STAT3 (Zhao2021The). These findings highlight TRIM14's role in cancer progression and resistance mechanisms.

## Interactions
TRIM14 is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in antiviral signaling and immune response. It is a key component of the WHIP-TRIM14-PPP6C complex, which is essential for RIG-I-mediated antiviral signaling. TRIM14 interacts with MAVS, facilitating the mitochondrial localization of WHIP and PPP6C, which in turn enhances the dephosphorylation and activation of RIG-I (Tan2017Assembly). The interaction between TRIM14 and RIG-I is enhanced by WHIP, which binds to polyubiquitin chains on RIG-I, specifically at the K164 site (Tan2017Assembly).

TRIM14 also interacts with the nucleoprotein (NP) of the influenza A virus, impairing the formation of the viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. This interaction promotes the degradation of NP, thereby inhibiting viral replication (Wu2019Inhibition). The PRYSPRY domain of TRIM14 is particularly effective in restricting viral RNA synthesis and RNP formation (Wu2019Inhibition). These interactions highlight TRIM14's multifaceted role in modulating immune responses and inhibiting viral replication.
