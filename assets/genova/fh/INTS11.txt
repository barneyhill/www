# INTS11

## Overview
INTS11 is a gene that encodes the protein integrator complex subunit 11, a crucial component of the Integrator complex involved in the 3' end processing of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and enhancer RNAs. This protein is categorized as an endonuclease due to its role in RNA cleavage, facilitated by its metallo-β-lactamase (MBL) and β-CASP domains, which are essential for its enzymatic activity (Albrecht2012snRNA). INTS11 forms a heterodimer with INTS9, a partnership vital for the proper processing of snRNAs, which are integral to the formation of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) (Albrecht2012snRNA). The protein's function extends to maintaining the structural integrity of Cajal bodies and histone locus bodies, as well as facilitating transcriptional activation by promoting the release of paused RNA polymerase II (Albrecht2018Integrator). Disruptions in INTS11 function can lead to various developmental and pathological conditions, underscoring its importance in normal cellular processes (Albrecht2018Integrator).

## Structure
INTS11 is a component of the Integrator complex, which plays a crucial role in the 3' end processing of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs). The protein is a paralogue of CPSF73 and shares structural similarities, particularly in the β-lactamase and β-CASP domains, with about 40% identity (Albrecht2018Integrator). INTS11 contains a metallo-β-lactamase (MBL) domain and a β-CASP domain, which are essential for its endonuclease activity. The MBL domain includes an αβ/βα sandwich fold, which is typical for enzymes in this family and is necessary for zinc ion coordination and substrate cleavage (Albrecht2012snRNA).

The C-terminal domain of INTS11 is crucial for its interaction with INTS9, forming a heterodimer that is essential for snRNA processing. This interaction is robust and resistant to denaturing conditions, indicating a strong quaternary structure (Albrecht2012snRNA). The binding site for INTS9 within INTS11 is located between amino acids 418 and 520, with the interaction site near the predicted RNA substrate entry site (Albrecht2012snRNA).

INTS11 can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may affect its functional domains and interactions. The protein may also undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which could influence its activity and stability.

## Function
INTS11 is a critical component of the Integrator complex, which is involved in the 3'-end processing of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and enhancer RNAs. This processing is essential for the biogenesis of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), which are crucial for RNA splicing (Albrecht2018Integrator). INTS11 forms a heterodimer with INTS9, and this interaction is necessary for the proper 3'-end formation of snRNAs. The depletion of INTS11 leads to misprocessing of snRNA, which can be rescued by expressing RNAi-resistant INTS11, highlighting its essential role in snRNA processing (Albrecht2012snRNA).

The INTS11 subunit, along with INTS9 and INTS4, forms a heterotrimeric complex that is vital for the endonucleolytic activity of the Integrator complex. This activity is important for maintaining the structural integrity of Cajal bodies and histone locus bodies, which are involved in snRNA biogenesis and histone mRNA production (Albrecht2018Integrator). INTS11 is also associated with the promoters of many protein-encoding genes, where it facilitates the release of paused RNA polymerase II, thus promoting transcriptional activation (Albrecht2018Integrator). The proper function of INTS11 is crucial for maintaining normal cellular functions, and its disruption can lead to various developmental and pathological conditions (Albrecht2018Integrator).

## Interactions
INTS11, a component of the integrator complex, is known for its critical role in the 3' end processing of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs). It forms a heterodimer with INTS9, which is essential for its function in snRNA processing. This interaction is highly specific and robust, even under stringent conditions, and is crucial for the activation of INTS11's endonuclease activity or its recruitment to the cleavage site within primary snRNA transcripts (Albrecht2012snRNA).

The interaction between INTS11 and INTS9 involves specific regions in their C-terminal domains, with the binding site on INTS11 extending from amino acids 418 to 520. This region is highly conserved across species, indicating its importance in the interaction (Albrecht2012snRNA). INTS11 also forms a heterotrimeric complex with INTS9 and INTS4, which is crucial for UsnRNA biogenesis. INTS4 acts as a scaffold, binding to the INTS9/11 heterodimer through its N-terminal HEAT repeats and a β-sheet rich C-terminal region (Albrecht2018Integrator).

Additionally, INTS11 is part of a complex with BRAT1 and INTS9, which is involved in regulating key neurodevelopmental genes. Mutations in BRAT1 can destabilize its interaction with the INTS11/INTS9 heterodimer, affecting UsnRNA processing (Dokaneheifard2023BRAT1).
