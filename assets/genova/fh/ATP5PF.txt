# ATP5PF

## Overview
The ATP5PF gene encodes the ATP synthase peripheral stalk subunit F6, a critical component of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex, also known as complex V. This protein is integral to the structural and functional stability of ATP synthase, a key enzyme in cellular energy production through oxidative phosphorylation. The peripheral stalk subunit F6 is part of the peripheral stalk, which connects the F1 catalytic domain to the FO membrane-embedded domain, ensuring the proper alignment and function of the enzyme during ATP synthesis. As a structural protein, subunit F6 interacts with other subunits, such as OSCP and b, to maintain the integrity of the ATP synthase complex, preventing the stators from rotating with the rotor. Mutations in ATP5PF can lead to metabolic disorders, highlighting its essential role in cellular energy metabolism (He2020Assembly; Gaspar2018Mitochondrial).

## Structure
The ATP5PF gene encodes the ATP synthase peripheral stalk subunit F6, a component of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex. This protein plays a crucial role in the structural integrity and function of ATP synthase by being part of the peripheral stalk, which is essential for maintaining the connection between the F1 catalytic domain and the FO membrane-embedded domain (He2020Assembly).

The peripheral stalk subunit F6 is involved in forming polar contacts with subunit b, contributing to the structural stability of the ATP synthase complex. It is part of a complex that includes subunits OSCP, b, e, f, and g, and its absence affects the stability and function of ATP synthase (He2020Assembly; Gu2019CryoEM). The structure of the peripheral stalk is rigidified by α-helices in the F6 and d subunits, which are crucial for the assembly and function of the ATP synthase complex (He2020Assembly).

The tertiary structure of subunit F6 involves interactions with other subunits, such as OSCP and b, which are important for the assembly of the peripheral stalk and the overall ATP synthase complex (Gu2019CryoEM). The quaternary structure of ATP5PF involves its integration into the peripheral stalk, contributing to the enzyme's stability and function in ATP production (He2020Assembly).

## Function
The ATP5PF gene encodes the ATP synthase peripheral stalk subunit F6, which is a crucial component of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex, also known as complex V. This complex is essential for ATP biosynthesis, a process that occurs during oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria. ATP synthase is composed of two main domains: the F1 catalytic core and the F0 membrane-spanning proton pump. The F1 domain is responsible for the catalytic conversion of ADP to ATP, while the F0 domain functions as a proton pump, utilizing the electrochemical gradient created by protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane (Tsipourlianos2024Regulatory; Gaspar2018Mitochondrial).

The peripheral stalk, which includes subunit F6, plays a critical role in stabilizing the ATP synthase complex by connecting the F1 and F0 domains. This stabilization is vital for maintaining the structural integrity of the enzyme, ensuring efficient ATP production. The peripheral stalk prevents the stators from spinning with the rotor, which is crucial for the proper function of the enzyme during ATP synthesis (Tauchmannová2024Variability; Ganapathi2022A). Mutations in ATP5PF can lead to metabolic disorders, highlighting its importance in cellular energy metabolism (Gaspar2018Mitochondrial).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATP5PF gene, which encodes a subunit of mitochondrial ATP synthase, are associated with neurogenic weakness, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP) syndrome. This condition is characterized by a range of neurological symptoms, including muscle weakness and coordination difficulties, as well as vision problems due to retinal degeneration (Gaspar2018Mitochondrial). The ATP5PF gene is located on chromosome 21q21.3 and plays a crucial role in the proper functioning of ATP synthase, an enzyme essential for ATP production in mitochondria. Disruptions in ATP synthase activity due to ATP5PF mutations can lead to impaired energy metabolism, contributing to the clinical manifestations observed in NARP syndrome (Gaspar2018Mitochondrial).

While the specific mechanisms by which ATP5PF mutations lead to these symptoms are not fully detailed in the provided context, the association with mitochondrial dysfunction suggests that energy deficits in high-demand tissues, such as the nervous system and retina, are likely contributors. The broader implications of ATP5PF mutations in mitochondrial diseases underscore the importance of this gene in maintaining cellular energy homeostasis (Gaspar2018Mitochondrial).

## Interactions
The ATP5PF gene encodes the ATP synthase peripheral stalk subunit F6, which is integral to the assembly and stability of the ATP synthase complex in human mitochondria. Subunit F6 is a component of the peripheral stalk, interacting with other subunits such as OSCP, b, d, e, f, and g to form a stable structure that supports the function of ATP synthase (He2020Assembly). These interactions are crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the enzyme, preventing the dissociation of the α3β3 domain from the central stalk, and resisting rotational torque during ATP synthesis (He2020Assembly).

The removal of subunit F6 results in the formation of vestigial complexes, indicating its essential role in the proper assembly of ATP synthase. This absence leads to a significant reduction in the levels of other subunits, such as ATP6, ATP8, and d, highlighting the importance of F6 in the stability and function of the enzyme complex (He2020Assembly). Subunit F6 also plays a role in binding the peripheral stalk to the catalytic module, facilitating the assembly process and ensuring the enzyme's ability to harness the proton motive force for ATP synthesis (He2020Assembly).
