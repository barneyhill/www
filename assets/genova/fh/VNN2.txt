# VNN2

## Overview
VNN2 is a gene that encodes the protein vanin 2, which is a member of the vanin family of proteins. Vanin 2 is categorized as a pantetheinase, an enzyme that plays a critical role in the hydrolysis of pantetheine into pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) and cysteamine, thereby contributing to the recycling of Coenzyme A. This enzymatic function is vital for various metabolic pathways, including those involved in fatty acid metabolism and oxidative stress response (Kaskow2012Diverse; Nitto2008Alternative). The protein is expressed in multiple human tissues, with notable expression in the spleen, kidney, and blood, particularly in neutrophils (Galland1998Two). Vanin 2 exists in both soluble and membrane-bound forms, and it is implicated in the regulation of the oxidative state of cells, potentially influencing innate immunity. Additionally, it plays a role in leukocyte adhesion and migration, particularly during inflammatory responses, by modulating β2 integrin function (Kaskow2012Diverse). The protein is also expressed on myeloid cells and serves as a marker for certain hematopoietic stem cells, highlighting its significance in immune cell function and hematopoietic processes (Bornhauser2020The).

## Structure
The VNN2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the vanin family, which is involved in various biological processes. The protein structure of VNN2 is characterized by the presence of a signal peptide, which is crucial for its secretion and function. The protein is known to be glycosylated, which is significant for its stability and activity. The VNN2 protein is also characterized by the presence of a nitrilase domain, which is essential for its enzymatic activity. This domain is involved in the hydrolysis of substrates, a critical function of the protein. The protein structure includes a hydrophobic region, which is important for its membrane association, and a hydrophilic region that contains a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, crucial for its attachment to cell membranes (Kaskow2012Diverse).

## Function
VNN2 (vanin 2) encodes a protein that functions as a pantetheinase, catalyzing the hydrolysis of pantetheine into pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) and cysteamine. This enzymatic activity is crucial for the recycling of Coenzyme A, which is essential for various cellular metabolic pathways, including fatty acid metabolism and the oxidative stress response (Kaskow2012Diverse; Nitto2008Alternative). VNN2 is expressed in a wide range of human tissues, with particularly high expression in the spleen, kidney, and blood, especially in neutrophils (Kaskow2012Diverse; Galland1998Two).

The protein exists in both soluble and membrane-bound forms and is involved in regulating the oxidative state of cells, potentially playing a role in innate immunity (Kaskow2012Diverse). VNN2 is also associated with leukocyte adhesion and migration, particularly in the context of inflammation, by modulating β2 integrin function, which is crucial for immune cell movement to sites of inflammation (Kaskow2012Diverse; Nitto2008Alternative). In the hematopoietic system, VNN2 is expressed on myeloid cells and serves as a marker for certain hematopoietic stem cells, indicating its role in immune cell function and hematopoietic processes (Bornhauser2020The).

## Clinical Significance
VNN2 (vanin 2) has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in inflammation and immune response. In pediatric B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), VNN2 expression is associated with chemoresistance and poor prognosis. High VNN2 levels correlate with a lower event-free survival rate and a higher risk of relapse, particularly in high-risk minimal residual disease (MRD) subgroups. VNN2-positive samples often exhibit genetic alterations such as deletions of PAX5, CDKN2A/B, and IKZF1, which are linked to chemoresistance (Bornhauser2020The).

In stroke recovery, rare variants in VNN2 are associated with better outcomes. These variants may affect protein stability and alter the electrostatic surface at the active site, influencing post-stroke inflammation and recovery processes (AlcaideConsuegra2024Rare).

In obesity, elevated serum levels of VNN2 are linked to increased inflammation and may predict outcomes of bariatric surgery. VNN2 levels correlate with inflammatory markers and are significantly higher in individuals with obesity, suggesting its role in obesity-related inflammation (Geng2023Serum).
