# UNC45A

## Overview
UNC45A is a gene that encodes the protein unc-45 myosin chaperone A, which functions as a molecular chaperone involved in the folding and assembly of nonmuscle myosin II (NM-II) filaments. This protein is categorized as a chaperone due to its role in assisting the proper folding and function of myosin, a critical component of the cytoskeleton in nonmuscle cells. The UNC45A protein is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of stress fibers, which are crucial for various cellular processes such as adhesion, morphogenesis, and mechanosensing (Lehtimäki2017UNC45a). It is also involved in immune responses, particularly in natural killer (NK) cells, where it regulates cytoskeletal dynamics necessary for cytotoxic activity (Iizuka2015UNC45A). Additionally, UNC45A plays a significant role in neuronal differentiation and cancer cell proliferation, highlighting its importance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Iizuka2017UNC45A; Eisa2019The).

## Structure
UNC45A is a protein that plays a crucial role in the folding and assembly of myosin, particularly nonmuscle myosin II (NM-II). The protein is composed of several distinct domains: an N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, a central domain, a neck domain, and a C-terminal UNC-45/CRO1/She4p (UCS) domain (Habicht2019UNC45A; Lehtimäki2017UNC45a). The TPR domain is involved in interactions with heat-shock proteins such as Hsp90 and Hsp70, facilitating the folding of myosin II (Lehtimäki2017UNC45a). The UCS domain is critical for binding and activating myosin motors, playing a key role in NM-II folding and stress fiber assembly (Habicht2019UNC45A; Lehtimäki2017UNC45a).

UNC45A exists in two isoforms, resulting from alternative splicing: a 944-residue isoform and a 929-residue isoform. The 944-residue isoform contains an additional 15-amino-acid proline-rich sequence, which is believed to form a polyproline II helical structure and is associated with faster degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Guo2011Differential). This sequence is absent in the 929-residue isoform, leading to its slower degradation and higher accumulation (Guo2011Differential). The presence of this proline-rich sequence in the 944-residue isoform suggests a regulatory role in protein turnover (Guo2011Differential).

## Function
The UNC45A gene encodes a protein that functions as a molecular chaperone, primarily involved in the folding and assembly of nonmuscle myosin II (NM-II) filaments in nonmuscle cells. This protein is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and function of stress fibers, which are essential for cell adhesion, morphogenesis, and mechanosensing (Lehtimäki2017UNC45a). UNC45A dynamically localizes to contractile stress fibers through its C-terminal UCS domain, which is essential for NM-II folding. The N-terminal TPR domain, while not necessary for its chaperone function, enhances the assembly of contractile actomyosin bundles (Lehtimäki2017UNC45a).

In human natural killer (NK) cells, UNC45A is vital for cytotoxic activity, particularly in the secretion of lytic granules. It regulates cytoskeletal dynamics by promoting the formation of actomyosin complexes, which are crucial for NK cell-mediated immune responses against viral infections and cancer (Iizuka2015UNC45A). The absence of UNC45A impairs the binding of nonmuscle myosin IIA to actin, affecting lytic granule exocytosis and reducing NK cell cytotoxicity (Iizuka2015UNC45A).

UNC45A also plays a role in neuronal cells, where it is necessary for neurite extension by regulating NMII activity, which is crucial for neuronal differentiation and neurite formation (Iizuka2017UNC45A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the UNC45A gene are linked to Osteo-Oto-Hepato-Enteric Syndrome (O2HE), a rare genetic disorder characterized by congenital diarrhea, neonatal cholestasis, impaired hearing, and bone fragility. These mutations lead to a significant decrease in UNC45A protein levels due to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and instability of truncated protein products. This results in defects in gut development and function, including impaired epithelial barrier integrity and disorganized actomyosin bundles, which contribute to severe diarrhea and cholestasis (Esteve2017OsteoOtoHepatoEnteric; Wang2023Case).

In cancer, particularly breast and ovarian cancers, UNC45A is overexpressed and plays a crucial role in cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth. It acts as a positive regulator of the glucocorticoid receptor, promoting NEK7 gene transcription, which is essential for cancer cell proliferation and centrosomal separation. The nuclear localization of UNC45A is significantly higher in cancer cells, suggesting its role in oncogenic transformation. Targeting UNC45A could potentially inhibit cancer cell proliferation while preserving normal cell function, making it a promising therapeutic target (Eisa2019The; Guo2011Differential).

## Interactions
UNC45A interacts with nonmuscle myosin IIA (NMIIA) and actin, playing a crucial role in cytoskeletal dynamics. It is essential for the ATP-dependent interactions between NMIIA and actin, which are necessary for NK cell function, particularly in lytic granule exocytosis and cytotoxicity (Iizuka2015UNC45A). UNC45A colocalizes with NMIIA at the effector-target cell interface in activated NK cells, indicating its involvement in NK cell activation and function (Iizuka2015UNC45A). 

In neuronal cells, UNC45A interacts with NMIIA and NMIIB, facilitating NMII folding and actin binding, which is crucial for neurite extension (Iizuka2017UNC45A). The protein also interacts with Hsp90, contributing to NMII folding and stress fiber assembly in nonmuscle cells (Lehtimäki2017UNC45a). 

UNC45A is involved in the regulation of the mitotic kinase NEK7, which is crucial for cancer cell proliferation. It regulates NEK7 expression and centrosome structure, highlighting its role in cell division and tumorigenesis (Eisa2019The). Additionally, UNC45A is identified as a novel centrosomal protein that regulates the nuclear-cytoplasmic localization of ChK1, a checkpoint kinase, in an Hsp90-independent manner (Jilani2015UNC45A).
