# ACP2

## Overview
The ACP2 gene encodes the lysosomal enzyme acid phosphatase 2, which is a crucial component of the lysosomal system, functioning primarily as a phosphatase. This enzyme is involved in the dephosphorylation of mannose-6-phosphate residues on lysosomal proteins, a process essential for the proper transport and function of these proteins within lysosomes (Lee2017Acid; Makrypidi2012Mannose). As a lysosomal acid phosphatase, ACP2 plays a significant role in the hydrolysis of phosphomonoesters at acidic pH, contributing to the breakdown of macromolecules and maintaining cellular waste processing and recycling (Bailey2014Purkinje). Additionally, ACP2 is involved in intracellular cholesterol homeostasis by dephosphorylating lysosomal Niemann-Pick C2 proteins, which are critical for cholesterol transfer processes (Lee2017Acid; Makrypidi2012Mannose). Mutations in the ACP2 gene have been linked to developmental and neurodegenerative conditions, underscoring its importance in normal cellular function and human health (Jiao2021Reduced; Mehdizadeh2020Alteration).

## Function
The ACP2 gene encodes a lysosomal acid phosphatase that plays a critical role in the dephosphorylation of mannose-6-phosphate (Man6P) residues on lysosomal proteins. This process is essential for the proper transport and function of these proteins within the lysosomal compartment (Lee2017Acid; Makrypidi2012Mannose). ACP2, along with ACP5, ensures the complete removal of the Man6P recognition marker, which is crucial for the receptor-dependent transport of soluble lysosomal proteins to lysosomes (Makrypidi2012Mannose). 

In healthy human cells, ACP2 is involved in the hydrolysis of various phosphomonoesters at an acidic pH, which is important for its enzymatic activity (Lee2017Acid). This activity contributes to the breakdown of macromolecules within lysosomes, aiding in cellular waste processing and recycling (Bailey2014Purkinje). ACP2 also plays a role in maintaining intracellular cholesterol homeostasis by dephosphorylating lysosomal Niemann-Pick C2 (NPC2) proteins, which are involved in cholesterol transfer processes (Lee2017Acid; Makrypidi2012Mannose). The enzyme is predominantly active in lysosomes, where it supports normal lysosomal function and prevents the accumulation of unesterified cholesterol (Makrypidi2012Mannose).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ACP2 gene, which encodes lysosomal acid phosphatase 2, have been linked to several developmental and neurodegenerative conditions. In mice, mutations in ACP2, specifically the naked-ataxia (nax) mutation, result in significant cerebellar abnormalities, including reduced granule cell proliferation and disrupted cerebellar architecture. These changes are associated with dysregulation of the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway and altered MYCN protein levels, which are crucial for cerebellar development (Jiao2021Reduced). The nax mutation also leads to phenotypic abnormalities such as delayed hair appearance, weight loss, and skin malformations, alongside cerebellar defects (Mehdizadeh2020Alteration).

Alterations in ACP2 activity can affect lysosomal function, leading to the accumulation of mannose 6-phosphate-containing proteins and unesterified cholesterol in lysosomes. This accumulation is linked to impaired cholesterol metabolism and transport, potentially contributing to conditions involving lysosomal storage or cholesterol metabolism (Makrypidi2012Mannose). The dysfunction of ACP2 has also been associated with progressive supranuclear palsy, an atypical parkinsonian condition, suggesting its role in neurodegenerative diseases (Mehdizadeh2020Alteration). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ACP2 in various developmental and metabolic disorders.
