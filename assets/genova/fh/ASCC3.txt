# ASCC3

## Overview
The ASCC3 gene encodes the protein known as Activating Signal Cointegrator 1 Complex Subunit 3, which is a critical component of the Activating Signal Cointegrator 1 Complex (ASCC). This protein functions primarily as a dual-cassette Ski2-like nucleic acid helicase, playing a pivotal role in DNA repair and transcription regulation. ASCC3 is involved in unwinding DNA to facilitate the repair of alkylation damage, thereby maintaining genomic integrity. Additionally, it is integral to ribosome quality control, resolving stalled ribosomes during translation, which is essential for proper protein synthesis and cellular function. ASCC3's helicase activity is modulated through interactions with other proteins, such as TRIP4, enhancing its role in transcription regulation and cellular stress responses. The protein's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in various diseases, including neuromuscular disorders and cancer (Juszkiewicz2020The; Soll2018RNA; Jia2020The; Jia2023Extended).

## Function
The ASCC3 gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the Activating Signal Cointegrator 1 Complex (ASCC), which plays significant roles in DNA repair and transcription regulation. ASCC3 functions as a dual-cassette Ski2-like nucleic acid helicase, unwinding DNA in a 3'-to-5' direction, which is essential for the repair of alkylation damage by providing single-stranded DNA for the α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase AlkBH3 (Soll2018RNA; Jia2020The). This activity is vital for maintaining genomic integrity by reversing N-alkyl lesions (Jia2020The).

ASCC3 is also involved in ribosome quality control, where it helps resolve stalled ribosomes during translation, a process crucial for maintaining proper protein synthesis and cellular function (Jia2023Extended; Juszkiewicz2020The). In the context of viral infections, ASCC3 modulates the transcription of antiviral type I interferon-stimulated genes, indicating its role in the cellular response to viral threats (Jia2023Extended).

The protein's helicase activity is regulated by its interaction with TRIP4, which enhances its function in transcription regulation and ribosome quality control (Jia2023Extended). ASCC3's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental stresses.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ASCC3 gene have been linked to a range of neuromuscular and neurodevelopmental disorders. Biallelic variants in ASCC3 are associated with a neuromuscular syndrome characterized by symptoms such as developmental delay, muscle fatigue, and intellectual disability. Specific genetic variations, including c.1897C>T, c.5002T>A, and c.5113G>T, are classified as 'variants of uncertain significance' but occur at highly conserved amino acid positions, suggesting potential functional impacts (Li2024Case). The severity of the condition correlates with the type of genetic variant, with more severe cases involving compound heterozygous variants (Nair2021Discovery).

ASCC3 is also implicated in cancer, where somatic mutations can disrupt its interaction with ASCC2, affecting DNA repair processes. These mutations are prevalent in various cancers and may contribute to cancer development by impairing DNA alkylation damage repair, crucial for maintaining genomic stability (Jia2020The). In glioblastoma multiforme, ASCC3 hypomethylation is associated with slower disease progression, suggesting a potential prognostic role. High ASCC3 mRNA expression correlates with better survival outcomes, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Sriram2022Contrasting).

## Interactions
ASCC3, a component of the Activating Signal Co-integrator 1 Complex (ASCC), engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in cellular processes such as transcriptional regulation and DNA repair. ASCC3 contains tandem Ski2-like NTPase/helicase cassettes essential for its function and interacts with TRIP4, which docks onto ASCC3 via a zinc finger domain. This interaction stimulates ASCC3's helicase activity by positioning an ASC-1 homology domain next to the C-terminal helicase cassette, supporting substrate engagement and assisting in DNA exit (Jia2022Extended).

ASCC3 is also part of the ribosome quality control trigger (RQT) complex, which includes ASCC2 and TRIP4, and helps resolve stalled ribosomes during aberrant translation (Jia2022Extended). It interacts with ASCC1, ASCC2, and ALKBH3 to support DNA alkylation damage repair by generating single-stranded DNA for dealkylation (Jia2022Extended; Jia2020The). The interaction between ASCC3 and ASCC2 is particularly important for DNA repair, with the N-terminal region of ASCC3 interacting with ASCC2 (Jia2020The).

ASCC3's interaction with RNA is significant in the context of ribosome quality control, where it binds to ribosomes and polysomes, suggesting a role in RNA quality control pathways (mordue2020identification). The ASC-1 complex, including ASCC3, co-elutes with ribosomal proteins, indicating a physical interaction with ribosomes (mordue2020identification).
