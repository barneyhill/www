# INTS14

## Overview
INTS14 is a gene that encodes the integrator complex subunit 14, a protein that is a critical component of the integrator complex involved in RNA processing. The integrator complex is essential for the 3'-end processing of noncoding uridine-rich small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and plays a significant role in the regulation of gene expression mediated by RNA polymerase II. INTS14, as part of this complex, contributes to the transcriptional regulation of protein-coding genes by facilitating the pause-release and elongation phases of RNA polymerase II transcription. Structurally, INTS14 forms a pseudo-symmetric heterodimer with INTS13, and together with INTS10, they create a trimeric module that is crucial for RNA cleavage and processing. The protein's involvement in RNA metabolism and gene expression regulation highlights its potential significance in cellular processes, including those related to cancer and developmental disorders (Xu2024Comprehensive; Sabath2020INTS10–INTS13–INTS14; Federico2017PanCancer).

## Structure
The INTS14 protein is a component of the integrator complex and forms a pseudo-symmetric heterodimer with INTS13. The crystal structure of the INTS13-INTS14 complex has been resolved to 2.5 Å, revealing a homologous domain organization between the two proteins. INTS14 consists of an N-terminal von Willebrand type A like domain (VWA), a central β-barrel domain, and a C-terminal α-helical domain, all connected by a long linker (Sabath2020INTS10–INTS13–INTS14). The VWA domain of INTS14 is structurally similar to that of integrin-αL and includes a MIDAS pocket involved in ion coordination, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions (Sabath2020INTS10–INTS13–INTS14).

The interface of the INTS13-INTS14 complex is extensive, involving all domains of both proteins, with hydrophobic interactions framed by polar hydrogen bonds or salt bridges. The β-barrel domains form a major contact around a rotational pseudosymmetry axis, and the interdomain linkers contribute to the interface by folding onto the opposite β-barrels and contacting the VWA domains (Sabath2020INTS10–INTS13–INTS14). The α-helical C-termini also contribute to binding by packing against the β-barrel or VWA domain of the binding partner (Sabath2020INTS10–INTS13–INTS14). The INTS13-INTS14 complex shares structural homology with the Ku70-Ku80 complex, suggesting a similar domain architecture (Sabath2020INTS10–INTS13–INTS14).

## Function
INTS14 is a component of the integrator complex, which is crucial for the regulation of gene expression mediated by RNA polymerase II. This complex is involved in the 3'-end processing of noncoding uridine-rich small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and plays a significant role in the activation of protein-coding genes. INTS14, as part of the integrator complex, contributes to the pause-release and elongation phases of RNA polymerase II transcription, facilitating the biogenesis of transcripts from distal regulatory elements, such as enhancers, which are important for tissue- and temporal-specific gene expression regulation (Federico2017PanCancer).

INTS14 is also part of a heterotrimer with INTS10 and INTS13, which is structurally related to the Ku70-Ku80 DNA repair complex. This heterotrimer binds RNA hairpins, a function essential for positioning the integrator complex for RNA cleavage. This activity is crucial for the proper processing of nascent RNA transcripts, impacting cellular RNA metabolism and gene expression regulation (Mascibroda2020INTS13Mutations). The increased expression of INTS14 in certain cancer cells suggests its involvement in cellular processes that may contribute to malignancy, although its precise role in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated (Xu2024Comprehensive).

## Clinical Significance
The INTS14 gene, a component of the integrator complex, plays a crucial role in RNA processing. While specific diseases directly linked to mutations in INTS14 have not been extensively documented, its involvement in the integrator complex suggests potential clinical significance. Dysregulation of integrator complex subunits, including INTS14, has been associated with developmental and disease phenotypes in various species. For instance, mutations in other integrator subunits like INTS1 and INTS8 have been linked to severe neurodevelopmental syndromes in humans, characterized by intellectual disability and epilepsy, suggesting that similar disruptions in INTS14 could potentially contribute to related conditions (Jung2023Generation).

In the context of cancer, alterations in the expression of integrator subunits, including INTS14, have been observed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Hypomethylation of INTS14 in HCC tissues indicates its potential role in tumorigenesis, although specific clinical outcomes related to INTS14 alone have not been detailed (Xu2024Comprehensive). The integrator complex's involvement in RNA processing and transcription regulation underscores the importance of further research into INTS14's role in human diseases, particularly those affecting neurological and developmental pathways.

## Interactions
INTS14 is a component of the integrator complex, which plays a crucial role in RNA processing. It forms a stable complex with INTS13 and INTS10, creating a trimeric module that is present in the nucleus of human cells (Sabath2020INTS10–INTS13–INTS14). The INTS13-INTS14 complex is a strongly intertwined heterodimer, requiring multiple mutations to disrupt their interaction, and is characterized by four main interaction patches that affect binding affinity (Sabath2020INTS10–INTS13–INTS14). INTS14 provides the main interaction surface for INTS10 through its von Willebrand type A (VWA) domain, which is a known protein-protein interaction domain. The deletion of the VWA domain abrogates the interaction with INTS10, while the VWA domain alone can enhance INTS10 pull-down efficiency (Sabath2020INTS10–INTS13–INTS14).

The INTS10-INTS13-INTS14 module binds nucleic acids, including single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), with a preference for RNA hairpins. This binding is largely charge-mediated and does not show sequence specificity (Sabath2020INTS10–INTS13–INTS14). The complex is involved in UsnRNA processing and RNAPII pause-termination, indicating its role in RNA processing and transcription regulation (Sabath2020INTS10–INTS13–INTS14). The structural features of the INTS13-INTS14 complex share similarities with the Ku70-Ku80 complex, which is involved in DNA repair, suggesting potential molecular functions for the INTS13-INTS14 complex (Sabath2020INTS10–INTS13–INTS14).
