# METTL15

## Overview
The METTL15 gene encodes the mitochondrial methyltransferase 15, a protein that plays a pivotal role in the post-transcriptional modification of mitochondrial 12S rRNA. This enzyme is categorized as a methyltransferase and is specifically involved in the methylation of the N4-cytidine at position C839 of the 12S rRNA, a modification crucial for the proper assembly and function of the mitochondrial ribosome (Lv2024Structural; Haute2019METTL15). The METTL15 protein is characterized by a two-domain structure, comprising an MTase domain responsible for its catalytic activity and a scaffold-like domain that aids in RNA substrate binding (Lv2024Structural). Localized within the mitochondrial matrix, METTL15 interacts with other mitochondrial proteins, such as the ribosome-binding factor hsRBFA, to facilitate its function (Lv2024Structural; Haute2019METTL15). The absence or dysfunction of METTL15 can lead to impaired mitochondrial translation and altered cellular metabolic states, underscoring its importance in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and efficient cellular respiration (Lv2024Structural; Haute2019METTL15).

## Structure
The METTL15 protein is a mitochondrial methyltransferase involved in the methylation of the m4C839 residue of human mitochondrial 12S rRNA. Structurally, METTL15 features a two-domain architecture: an MTase domain and a scaffold-like domain. The MTase domain is characterized by a Rossmann-like fold, which is typical of methyltransferases and facilitates the binding of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a cofactor essential for its methyltransferase activity (Lv2024Structural). This domain is composed of two parts: the N-terminal sequence (Pro 74 to Thr 179) and the C-terminal sequence (Glu 295 to Leu 407) (Lv2024Structural).

The scaffold-like domain of METTL15 contains five α-helices and one η-helix, forming a structure that supports RNA substrate binding (Lv2024Structural). The protein interacts with RNA substrates primarily through electrostatic interactions with the phosphodiester backbone, rather than the bases, indicating a lack of sequence specificity in RNA recognition (Lv2024Structural).

In its quaternary structure, METTL15 forms a complex with the mitochondrial ribosome-binding factor hsRBFA and SAM, highlighting specific interactions through hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions (Lv2024Structural). The protein's interaction with hsRBFA is crucial for its recruitment to the mitochondrial small subunit (mt-SSU) for rRNA modification (Lv2024Structural).

## Function
The METTL15 gene encodes a mitochondrial methyltransferase enzyme that plays a crucial role in the modification of mitochondrial 12S rRNA by introducing N4-methylcytidine at position C839. This modification is essential for the proper assembly and function of the mitochondrial ribosome, which is critical for mitochondrial protein synthesis and cellular energy production (Lv2024Structural; Haute2019METTL15). METTL15's activity ensures the correct folding of 12S rRNA, facilitating the incorporation of late assembly components into the small ribosomal subunit, thereby stabilizing the mitoribosome structure (Haute2019METTL15).

The enzyme interacts with S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a common methyl donor, to perform its methylation function. The METTL15 protein has a two-domain structure, with the MTase domain responsible for catalytic activity and a scaffold-like domain aiding in RNA substrate binding (Lv2024Structural). METTL15 is localized within the mitochondria, specifically in the mitochondrial matrix, where it interacts with other mitochondrial proteins to facilitate its function (Haute2019METTL15).

The absence of METTL15 leads to impaired mitochondrial translation, reduced levels of respiratory complexes, and altered cellular metabolic states, highlighting its importance in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and efficient cellular respiration (Lv2024Structural; Haute2019METTL15).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the METTL15 gene have been associated with several clinical conditions. METTL15 is crucial for mitochondrial function, and its knockdown can lead to impaired mRNA translation and decreased synthesis of respiratory chain proteins, ultimately inhibiting mitochondrial respiration. This dysfunction is linked to increased reactive oxygen species and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, which can alter cellular metabolism (Lv2024Structural; He2024METTL).

In the context of cancer, METTL15 expression is up-regulated in lung cancer tissues and cells. Silencing METTL15 in these cells inhibits proliferation, colony formation, invasion, and immune escape, while promoting apoptosis. This suggests that METTL15 plays a role in lung cancer progression and could be a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Zhang2024METTL).

METTL15 has also been implicated in neurodegenerative conditions. Its knockdown affects histone lactylation, particularly H4K12-la, which is linked to Alzheimer's disease. This indicates a potential connection between METTL15 activity and neurodegenerative diseases (Lv2024Structural).

Additionally, METTL15 is associated with diabetic nephropathy, as its upregulation is noted in this condition, highlighting its broader role in health and disease (He2024METTL).

## Interactions
METTL15 is a mitochondrial methyltransferase that interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in mitochondrial ribosome function. It primarily interacts with the mitochondrial ribosome-binding factor hsRBFA and 12S rRNA. The C-terminal helix of hsRBFA is essential for its recognition by METTL15, facilitating the formation of a complex that includes S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and RNA substrates (Lv2024Structural). METTL15 binds to RNA through electrostatic interactions with the phosphodiester backbone, rather than the bases, and this interaction is not sequence-specific (Lv2024Structural).

The METTL15 protein also interacts with an assembly intermediate of the mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit, specifically the 28S subunit, and copurifies with almost all small subunit proteins, except for mS37, mS38, and mS39 (Laptev2020METTL15). It is associated with the RBFA protein, a homologue of the bacterial ribosome assembly factor RbfA, suggesting that METTL15's substrate is a 28S assembly intermediate (Laptev2020METTL15). These interactions are crucial for the methylation of the m4C839 residue in the 12S rRNA, which is important for the proper assembly and function of the mitochondrial ribosome (Lv2024Structural).
