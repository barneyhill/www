# PLSCR3

## Overview
Phospholipid scramblase 3 (PLSCR3) is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial membrane protein involved in the translocation of phospholipids, particularly cardiolipin, across the mitochondrial membrane. This protein plays a critical role in maintaining mitochondrial membrane asymmetry and is implicated in various cellular processes, including apoptosis and mitophagy. PLSCR3 is characterized as a bitopic protein with a type-II topology, featuring a single transmembrane domain that anchors it to the inner mitochondrial membrane (Luévano‐Martínez2017Topological). The protein's activity is modulated by calcium and protons, and it undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and palmitoylation, which influence its function and localization (Kodigepalli2014Roles). Beyond its mitochondrial roles, PLSCR3 is involved in cell-to-cell communication through an exosomal pathway, suggesting its function as a paracrine modulator (Inuzuka2013ALG-2-interacting). Alterations in the PLSCR3 gene have been associated with metabolic disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in conditions such as obesity and insulin resistance (Wiedmer2004Adiposity).

## Structure
Phospholipid scramblase 3 (PLSCR3) is a mitochondrial membrane protein characterized by a single transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic N-terminal region. The protein is anchored to the inner mitochondrial membrane by its C-terminal transmembrane alpha-helix, with the N-terminal domain oriented towards the intermembrane space (Luévano‐Martínez2017Topological). PLSCR3 is a bitopic protein with a type-II topology, indicating that it spans the membrane once (Luévano‐Martínez2017Topological).

PLSCR3 undergoes post-translational modifications, including threonine phosphorylation by protein kinase C-delta (PKC-d), which is antagonized by heat shock protein 27 (HSP27). This phosphorylation is crucial for the translocation of cardiolipin across the mitochondrial membrane, influencing apoptotic processes (Kodigepalli2014Roles). PLSCR3 is also palmitoylated, a modification that affects its localization and function within the cell (Kodigepalli2014Roles).

The protein has several isoforms resulting from alternative splicing, which may contribute to its diverse functional roles in cellular processes such as apoptosis and phospholipid translocation (Kodigepalli2014Roles). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of PLSCR3 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
Phospholipid scramblase 3 (PLSCR3) is a protein involved in the translocation of phospholipids across the mitochondrial membrane, playing a crucial role in mitochondrial function and apoptosis. It is primarily located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it facilitates the redistribution of phospholipids, particularly cardiolipin (CL), from the inner to the outer mitochondrial membrane. This process is essential for maintaining mitochondrial membrane asymmetry and is crucial for cellular processes such as apoptosis and mitophagy (Luévano‐Martínez2017Topological).

PLSCR3 is activated by calcium and protons, which bind to the protein and modulate its activity. This activation is crucial for its function in maintaining mitochondrial phospholipid composition and influencing mitochondrial membrane dynamics (Luévano‐Martínez2017Topological). The protein's activity is also linked to the regulation of cardiolipin biosynthesis and resynthesis, impacting mitochondrial structure and function, which in turn affects cell proliferation, respiration, and apoptosis sensitivity (Van2006Phospholipid).

In addition to its mitochondrial roles, PLSCR3 is involved in cell-to-cell communication. It is secreted via an exosomal pathway and can be taken up by recipient cells, suggesting a role as a paracrine modulator (Inuzuka2013ALG-2-interacting). This secretion is dependent on palmitoylation and involves the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) pathway (Inuzuka2013ALG-2-interacting).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the PLSCR3 gene have been linked to several metabolic disorders. In mice, the targeted deletion of PLSCR3 results in increased adiposity, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, and dyslipidemia, conditions that are indicative of metabolic syndrome (Wiedmer2004Adiposity). These mice also exhibit elevated levels of plasma glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, and nonesterified fatty acids, along with decreased adiponectin and increased leptin levels, which are associated with obesity-related insulin resistance (Wiedmer2004Adiposity).

PLSCR3 deficiency is also associated with increased levels of pro-inflammatory lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) molecules, which are linked to conditions such as atherosclerosis and potentially other inflammatory diseases (Mutch2007Mobilization). The deficiency in PLSCR3 affects lipid metabolism, particularly in adipose tissue, and may contribute to insulin resistance and the synthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) (Mutch2007Mobilization).

The gene's role in lipid metabolism and inflammation suggests that alterations in PLSCR3 could contribute to the development of obesity-related inflammatory conditions and cardiovascular diseases (Mutch2007Mobilization). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PLSCR3 in metabolic and inflammatory disorders.

## Interactions
Phospholipid scramblase 3 (PLSCR3) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes such as apoptosis and mitochondrial function. PLSCR3 interacts with protein kinase C delta (PKCδ) in the brain, particularly in the context of ischemia. This interaction is observed in hippocampal mitochondria, where PKCδ enhances PLSCR3 activity, potentially leading to pro-apoptotic protein release (Kowalczyk2009Association). 

PLSCR3 also interacts with ALG-2 (apoptosis-linked gene 2), a Ca2+-binding protein, although this interaction does not significantly affect its exosomal secretion (Inuzuka2013ALG-2-interacting). The protein is involved in the exosomal pathway, where it is secreted and taken up by recipient cells, suggesting a role in intercellular communication (Inuzuka2013ALG-2-interacting).

In the context of apoptosis, PLSCR3 is involved in the mitochondrial targeting of tBid, a pro-apoptotic protein. This process is facilitated by the translocation of cardiolipin to the mitochondrial surface, which is enhanced by PLSCR3 activity (Liu2008Role). PLSCR3's interactions with these proteins highlight its role in modulating apoptotic pathways and mitochondrial dynamics.
