# ENTPD8

## Overview
ENTPD8, or ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 8, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane enzyme involved in the hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates and diphosphates into monophosphates. This enzymatic activity is crucial for regulating extracellular nucleotide levels, thereby influencing purinergic signaling pathways, which are vital for various physiological processes (Chen2023Bleomycin; Haas2021Extracellular). The ENTPD8 protein is characterized by two transmembrane domains and is predominantly located at the plasma membrane, with its active site oriented towards the extracellular environment (Fausther2007Cloning). It plays a significant role in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis by modulating immune responses and preventing inflammation, particularly in tissues such as the liver, gut, and kidney (Chen2023Bleomycin; Haas2021Extracellular). Alterations in ENTPD8 expression have been linked to various diseases, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Chen2023Bleomycin; Jiwaganont2024Investigation).

## Structure
The ENTPD8 protein is encoded by the human ENTPD8 gene and consists of 495 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 53,888 Da and an isoelectric point of 5.19 (Fausther2007Cloning). The protein features two transmembrane domains, one located near the NH2 terminus (amino acids 9-30) and another near the COOH terminus (amino acids 472-488), indicating its role as a transmembrane protein (Fausther2007Cloning). The amino acid sequence includes seven potential N-glycosylation sites, which are common post-translational modifications that may affect protein folding and stability (Fausther2007Cloning).

ENTPD8 contains five apyrase conserved regions, which are characteristic of the NTPDase family and are involved in nucleotide hydrolysis (Fausther2007Cloning). The protein also has potential phosphorylation sites, including conserved sites for protein kinase C and casein kinase II, which may regulate its activity (Fausther2007Cloning). The NH2-terminal sequence of ENTPD8 shows high homology with the canalicular ecto-ATPase/ATPDase from porcine liver, suggesting orthology and a conserved function across species (Fausther2007Cloning). The gene is organized into nine exons and is located on chromosome 9q34 (Fausther2007Cloning).

## Function
ENTPD8, or ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 8, is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in nucleotide metabolism by hydrolyzing nucleoside triphosphates and diphosphates into monophosphates. This activity is essential for regulating extracellular nucleotide levels, which in turn influences purinergic signaling pathways. ENTPD8 is located at the plasma membrane, characterized by two membrane-spanning domains with an active site facing the extracellular environment, allowing it to effectively dephosphorylate nucleotides outside the cell (Chen2023Bleomycin).

In healthy human cells, ENTPD8 is involved in the clearance of extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a process that is vital for preventing innate intestinal inflammation. By inhibiting glycolysis metabolism in immune cells, ENTPD8 helps maintain proper immune responses and prevents inflammation, contributing to overall cellular and organismal homeostasis (Chen2023Bleomycin). The enzyme's activity is particularly significant in tissues where purinergic signaling is crucial, such as the liver, gut, and kidney, suggesting its involvement in maintaining homeostasis in these tissues (Haas2021Extracellular). ENTPD8's role in these processes underscores its importance in normal physiological functions and its potential impact on health when dysregulated.

## Clinical Significance
ENTPD8 has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In Epstein-Barr virus-associated gastric cancer (EBVaGC), ENTPD8 is down-regulated, which is associated with poorer prognosis. Its expression is positively correlated with immune response, suggesting its role in modulating the immune environment within tumors. This makes ENTPD8 a potential biomarker for predicting the response to immunotherapy in EBVaGC (Chen2023Bleomycin). 

In the context of feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), decreased expression of ENTPD8 is linked to cardiac fibrosis and myocardial ischemic injury. This downregulation may contribute to the pathogenesis of HCM through its involvement in profibrotic signaling pathways (Jiwaganont2024Investigation).

ENTPD8's role in immune regulation is further highlighted by its involvement in energy metabolism and immune pathways in EBVaGC, where it is part of a more active immune response compared to EBV-negative gastric cancer (Chen2023Bleomycin). These findings underscore the significance of ENTPD8 in disease pathogenesis and its potential as a therapeutic target.
