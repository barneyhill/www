# CAPN14

## Overview
CAPN14 is a gene that encodes the protein calpain 14, a member of the calpain family of calcium-dependent cysteine proteases. Calpain 14 is primarily expressed in the esophagus and plays a significant role in maintaining epithelial integrity and function. The protein is characterized by its unique structure, which includes domains such as the cysteine protease core and penta-EF-hand, contributing to its distinct activity profile compared to other calpains (Litosh2017Calpain14). CAPN14 is dynamically regulated by cytokines, particularly interleukin-13 (IL-13), and is implicated in the pathogenesis of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), a chronic inflammatory condition of the esophagus. Genetic variants in CAPN14 have been associated with an increased risk of EoE, highlighting its clinical significance (Davis2016Eosinophilic; Kottyan2014Genomewide).

## Structure
CAPN14, a member of the calpain family, is characterized by its unique molecular structure. The protein consists of 684 amino acids and is encoded by a gene located on chromosome 2p23.1 (Litosh2017Calpain14). The proposed structure of CAPN14 includes several distinct domains: an N-terminal anchor, a cysteine protease core (PC) domain, a C2-like (C2L) domain, and a penta-EF-hand (PEF) domain (Litosh2017Calpain14). The PC domain is divided into two subdomains, PC1 and PC2, with PC1 containing the catalytic cysteine residue and PC2 containing histidine and asparagine residues (Litosh2017Calpain14).

The secondary structure of CAPN14 is composed of approximately 31% alpha-helices, 20% beta-strands, and 49% unstructured coils (Litosh2017Calpain14). The catalytic site includes Cys101 in PC1 and His254/Asn278 in PC2, with putative calcium-binding sites identified through sequence alignment with other calpains (Litosh2017Calpain14). CAPN14's structure is modeled based on human CAPN2, highlighting its nonclassical nature within the calpain family (Litosh2017Calpain14). The protein's unique structure contributes to its distinct activity and inhibition profile compared to other calpains (Litosh2017Calpain14).

## Function
CAPN14, a member of the calpain family, is a calcium-dependent cysteine protease primarily expressed in the esophagus. It plays a crucial role in maintaining epithelial integrity and function. CAPN14 is involved in the regulation of epithelial structure and barrier function, particularly in the esophageal epithelium. It is dynamically regulated by cytokines such as IL-13, which significantly induces its expression in esophageal epithelial cells (Davis2016Eosinophilic; Litosh2017Calpain14).

In healthy cells, CAPN14 is thought to protect the integrity of esophageal tissue, potentially acting as a defense mechanism against damage from food consumption. This is supported by its higher expression in the esophagus compared to other tissues and its low expression in species with a keratinized esophagus (Litosh2017Calpain14). CAPN14's activity is finely tuned to ensure proper restructuring of the epithelium, with overactivity leading to disruption of epithelial integrity and underactivity constraining the restructuring process (Davis2016Eosinophilic).

The protein is localized in the basal and suprabasal regions of the esophageal epithelium and shows dynamic subcellular localization, including cytoplasmic, nuclear, and apical regions, depending on the cellular environment (Davis2016Eosinophilic).

## Clinical Significance
The CAPN14 gene is clinically significant due to its association with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), a chronic allergic inflammatory condition of the esophagus. Genetic variants in CAPN14, particularly single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), have been linked to an increased risk of developing EoE. These genetic variations can lead to altered expression levels of CAPN14, which is crucial for maintaining esophageal epithelial integrity (Litosh2017Calpain14; Kottyan2014Genomewide).

In EoE, CAPN14 expression is upregulated in response to the cytokine IL-13, which is overexpressed in patients with the condition. This upregulation can result in impaired epithelial barrier function, characterized by the loss of desmoglein 1 (DSG1) expression, a protein essential for cell adhesion and barrier integrity. Overexpression of CAPN14 disrupts epithelial architecture, leading to increased permeability and inflammation in the esophagus (Davis2016Eosinophilic).

The CAPN14 gene is located at the 2p23 locus and is part of the classical calpain subfamily. Its expression is largely restricted to the esophagus, making it a tissue-specific marker for EoE. The identification of CAPN14 as an EoE-risk locus has provided insights into the pathogenesis of the disease and potential therapeutic targets (Litosh2017Calpain14; Kottyan2017Genetics).

## Interactions
CAPN14, a member of the calpain family, is involved in interactions within the esophageal epithelium, particularly in the context of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). Its expression is significantly upregulated by the cytokine IL-13, which leads to increased CAPN14 mRNA levels. This upregulation is associated with the disruption of epithelial cell architecture and impaired barrier function, primarily due to the reduction of desmoglein-1 (DSG1) expression, a critical component of cell-cell junctions. CAPN14 overexpression decreases DSG1 levels, disrupts epithelial architecture, and increases permeability, indicating a specific interaction between CAPN14 and DSG1 (Litosh2017Calpain14).

CAPN14's role in IL-13-induced responses is complex. While its upregulation impairs barrier function, its downregulation hinders the repair of IL-13-induced epithelial changes, suggesting that CAPN14 acts as a mediator in IL-13 signaling pathways. This involvement affects the esophageal epithelial transcriptome and potentially interacts with other proteins involved in inflammatory responses (Litosh2017Calpain14). Although CAPN14 is inhibited by various classical calpain inhibitors, such as E-64 and acetyl-CAST, these inhibitors are less efficient in inactivating CAPN14 compared to CAPN1, indicating distinct kinetic and inhibition characteristics (Litosh2017Calpain14).
