# GABRA3

## Overview
The GABRA3 gene encodes the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor subunit alpha3, a critical component of the GABA A receptor, which is a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel involved in mediating fast synaptic inhibition in the central nervous system. This receptor plays a pivotal role in maintaining the excitatory/inhibitory balance in the brain by facilitating the influx of chloride ions upon binding to the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), leading to neuronal hyperpolarization and reduced excitability (Ohlson2007Editing; Syed2020Effects). The alpha3 subunit is particularly significant during brain development and is selectively distributed in specific brain regions, contributing to tonic inhibition (Syed2020Effects). Additionally, the GABRA3 gene undergoes adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing, which can alter the protein's function and is crucial for normal brain development (Ohlson2007Editing). Beyond its neurological roles, GABRA3 is implicated in various cancers, where its expression influences tumor progression and metastasis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Long2017miR92b3p; Gumireddy2016The).

## Structure
The GABRA3 gene encodes the alpha3 subunit of the GABA A receptor, a ligand-gated ion channel involved in fast synaptic inhibition in the brain. The primary structure of the GABRA3 protein consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, which includes several key regions affected by missense variants such as p.Q242L, p.T166M, p.Y474C, p.G47R, and p.T336M (Niturad2017Rare). The secondary structure of the protein includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which are typical of GABA A receptor subunits. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, crucial for its function as part of the receptor complex (Niturad2017Rare).

The quaternary structure of the GABRA3 protein involves its assembly with other subunits, typically forming a heteropentameric complex with two alpha, two beta, and one gamma subunit, which determines the receptor's functional properties and expression pattern (Niturad2017Rare). The protein includes an extracellular ligand-binding domain and transmembrane domains, which are essential for its role in ion channel function (Ohlson2007Editing). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation may occur, affecting the protein's function and regulation. Splice variants of GABRA3 can result in different isoforms with distinct functional properties, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
The GABRA3 gene encodes the alpha3 subunit of the GABA A receptor, a crucial component of the central nervous system's inhibitory neurotransmission system. This receptor is a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel that mediates fast synaptic inhibitory neurotransmission by binding to the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Upon GABA binding, the receptor facilitates the influx of chloride ions into the neuron, leading to hyperpolarization and a reduction in neuronal excitability (Ohlson2007Editing; Syed2020Effects).

The alpha3 subunit is selectively distributed in specific brain regions, including the reticular thalamic nucleus, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, and the medial entorhinal cortex, where it contributes to tonic inhibition and the maintenance of the excitatory/inhibitory balance in the brain (Syed2020Effects). This subunit is particularly important during brain development, being one of the most widely expressed alpha subunits during embryonic and early postnatal stages (Syed2020Effects).

The GABRA3 gene undergoes adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing, which alters the amino acid sequence of the protein, potentially affecting the regulation of chloride permeability of the channel. This editing increases with age, reaching nearly 100% in the adult brain, indicating its importance in normal brain development (Ohlson2007Editing).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GABRA3 gene, which encodes the alpha3 subunit of the GABA A receptor, have been implicated in various cancers. In breast cancer, GABRA3 is aberrantly expressed, promoting metastasis through the activation of the AKT signaling pathway. This activation enhances cell motility, invasion, and increases the stem cell population, contributing to metastasis and therapy resistance. The unedited form of GABRA3 increases phosphorylated AKT levels, promoting cancer cell migration and invasion, while the RNA-edited form suppresses these effects (Gumireddy2016The). 

In pancreatic cancer, GABRA3 expression is higher in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. The tumor suppressor miR-92b-3p targets GABRA3, and its downregulation is associated with increased GABRA3 expression, leading to enhanced tumor growth and invasion (Long2017miR92b3p).

In gliomas, higher expression of GABRA3 is associated with better overall survival in patients with lower-grade gliomas, suggesting that GABRA3 may play a protective role in these tumors by maintaining inhibitory signaling (Badalotti2024Gene). These findings highlight the potential of GABRA3 as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
GABRA3, the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor subunit alpha3, is involved in various interactions that influence its function and role in cellular processes. The GABRA3 gene undergoes adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing by the enzymes ADAR1 and ADAR2, which results in an amino acid change from isoleucine to methionine in the transmembrane domain 3 of the receptor. This editing can potentially alter the receptor's channel environment, affecting its gating and inactivation properties (Ohlson2007Editing).

In the context of cancer, GABRA3 interacts with extracellular matrix (ECM) components such as S100B, COL6A6, VIT, and FBN3, which are implicated in breast cancer progression. These interactions suggest that GABRA3 forms dynamic axes with ECM molecules, playing a significant role in cancer cell invasion and metastasis (Yang2024BZDRs). Additionally, GABRA3 is targeted by miR-92b-3p, a microRNA that binds to the 3′-untranslated region of GABRA3 mRNA, inhibiting its expression. This interaction is significant in pancreatic cancer, where miR-92b-3p acts as a tumor suppressor by reducing GABRA3 expression, thereby influencing cancer cell proliferation and invasion (Long2017miR92b3p).
