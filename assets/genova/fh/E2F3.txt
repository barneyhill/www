# E2F3

## Overview
E2F3 is a gene that encodes the E2F transcription factor 3, a member of the E2F family of transcription factors, which are pivotal in regulating the cell cycle and cellular proliferation. The E2F3 gene produces two isoforms, E2F3a and E2F3b, through alternative promoter usage, each with distinct regulatory roles and expression patterns. E2F3a is tightly regulated and accumulates during the G1/S transition of the cell cycle, while E2F3b is constitutively expressed. The E2F transcription factor 3 is primarily involved in the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase by activating genes necessary for DNA replication. It interacts with various proteins, including the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and TFE3, to exert its functions. E2F3 has significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer, where its overexpression and amplification are linked to tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis in several cancers, including bladder, prostate, and melanoma (Oeggerli2004E2F3; Feng2018E2F3; Leone1998E2F3).

## Structure
The E2F3 gene encodes two distinct protein isoforms, E2F3a and E2F3b, which arise from alternative promoters within the E2F3 locus. Both isoforms share identical sequences in the DNA-binding domain, dimerization domain with the DP1 partner protein, and the transcription activation-Rb binding domain, allowing them to bind to identical DNA sequences and interact with Rb equivalently (Leone2000Identification). E2F3a contains an N-terminal extension that includes a potential cyclin A binding domain, similar to E2F1, which is absent in E2F3b. This N-terminal extension is significant for the regulation of E2F3a, influencing its accumulation and activity during the cell cycle (Adams2000Complex; Leone2000Identification).

E2F3b, lacking the N-terminal extension, is constitutively expressed and not tightly regulated by cell proliferation, unlike E2F3a, which is regulated by cell growth and Myc (Adams2000Complex; Leone2000Identification). The absence of the N-terminal sequences in E2F3b suggests a different regulatory mechanism, potentially affecting its role in transcriptional repression in quiescent cells (Leone2000Identification). E2F3a and E2F3b also differ in their interaction with other proteins; E2F3a can synergize with TFE3 to activate transcription, a function not shared by E2F3b (Giangrande2003Identification).

## Function
E2F3 is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in regulating the cell cycle, particularly in the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase. It is essential for the induction of the S phase by controlling the expression of genes necessary for DNA replication, such as Cdc6, cyclin E, and cdk2 (Leone1998E2F3). E2F3 activity is tightly regulated during the cell cycle, accumulating during the G1/S transition and declining during the S phase, before reappearing in the next G1 phase (Leone1998E2F3). This regulation is achieved through interactions with cyclin A/cdk2, which phosphorylates associated proteins, leading to the inactivation of E2F3's DNA-binding activity (DeGregori2002The).

E2F3 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it activates genes encoding enzymes and proteins necessary for DNA synthesis, such as deoxynucleotide enzymes and DNA synthetic enzymes (Leone1998E2F3). The absence of E2F3 results in significant defects in DNA synthesis initiation and progression, highlighting its critical role in normal cellular proliferation (Humbert2000E2f3). E2F3 also contributes to the transcriptional regulation of E2F-responsive genes in a dose-dependent manner, ensuring proper cell cycle regulation and proliferation (Humbert2000E2f3).

## Clinical Significance
E2F3 is implicated in several cancers due to its role in cell cycle regulation and proliferation. In bladder cancer, E2F3 amplification and overexpression are associated with invasive tumor growth and high tumor grades. This gene is frequently amplified in muscle-invasive bladder cancers, correlating with increased tumor proliferation and poor survival outcomes (Oeggerli2004E2F3). In prostate cancer, E2F3 overexpression is linked to tumor aggressiveness and poor clinical outcomes. It acts as an independent prognostic marker and is involved in the E2F/RB pathway, influencing the expression of genes like the interleukin 6 receptor (IL-6R) (Foster2004Transcription; Olsson2006Role; Libertini2011The).

In melanoma, E2F3 is overexpressed due to copy number variations, contributing to tumor progression and poor prognosis. Its expression is significantly correlated with decreased overall and disease-free survival (Feng2018E2F3). In endometrial cancer, E2F3 overexpression is associated with worse overall and relapse-free survival, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic biomarker (Zhang2020Bioinformatics). These findings underscore the clinical significance of E2F3 in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
E2F3 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cell cycle regulation and transcriptional control. E2F3a and E2F3b, two isoforms of E2F3, have distinct interactions due to their structural differences. E2F3a contains multiple E2F and Myc binding sites, which are absent in E2F3b, leading to different regulatory roles during the cell cycle (Leone2000Identification).

E2F3b specifically interacts with the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) in quiescent cells, forming a predominant E2F-Rb complex that suggests a role in transcriptional repression (Leone2000Identification). This interaction is unique to E2F3b, as E2F3a does not form such complexes in quiescent cells (Leone2000Identification).

TFE3, a member of the basic helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors, is identified as a specific binding partner for both E2F3a and E2F3b. This interaction is crucial for the synergistic activation of certain promoters, such as the p68 subunit gene of DNA polymerase α, and is dependent on the marked box domain of E2F3 (Giangrande2003Identification). TFE3 does not interact with other E2F family members like E2F1, highlighting the specificity of its interaction with E2F3 (Giangrande2003Identification).
