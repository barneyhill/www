# KRTAP23-1

## Overview
KRTAP23-1 is a gene that encodes the keratin-associated protein 23-1, a member of the keratin-associated protein (KAP) family, which plays a crucial role in the structural composition of hair and nails. The protein encoded by KRTAP23-1 is characterized by its unique amino acid composition, notably a high serine content, and lacks the repeat structures commonly found in other KAPs, distinguishing it within the family (Rogers2006Human). This protein is primarily expressed in the cuticular and cortical regions of the hair, where it contributes to the mechanical strength and resilience of keratinized tissues by interacting with keratin intermediate filaments (Rogers2006Human; Perdigão2019Dark). The KRTAP23-1 gene is part of a cluster of genes that exhibit characteristics typical of dark proteins, such as short length and atypical amino acid composition, which are integral to the formation of the hair shaft and the interfilamentous matrix in the hair cortex (Perdigão2019Dark).

## Structure
The KRTAP23-1 gene encodes a protein that is 6.9 kDa in size and is the sole member of the KAP23 family. This protein is characterized by a high serine content (20.1 mol %) and a lower cysteine content (7.7 mol %), with significant amounts of leucine and glycine. Unlike other keratin-associated proteins, KRTAP23-1 does not contain an obvious repeat structure, which distinguishes it from other KAP families that often have pentameric or decameric repeat structures (Rogers2006Human).

The primary structure of KRTAP23-1 is defined by its unique amino acid composition, which includes a higher proportion of serine compared to cysteine. The absence of a repeat structure suggests a distinct secondary structure compared to other KAPs, although specific details on secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures are not provided in the available literature. The protein's molecular structure is inferred from its amino acid sequence, but no specific domains or prominent folds are mentioned (Rogers2006Human).

KRTAP23-1 is expressed in both the cuticular and cortical regions of the hair, indicating its role in hair structure, but specific post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms are not detailed in the context provided (Rogers2006Human).

## Function
KRTAP23-1, a member of the keratin-associated protein family, plays a significant role in the structure and function of hair and nails. These proteins are integral to the formation of the hair shaft, where they interact with keratin intermediate filaments to provide mechanical strength and resilience to keratinized tissues (Perdigão2019Dark). KRTAP23-1 is primarily active in the hair follicle, influencing hair texture and quality by contributing to the interfilamentous matrix in the hair cortex. This matrix is crucial for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through disulfide bond cross-linking with hair keratins (Perdigão2019Dark).

The keratin-associated proteins, including KRTAP23-1, are characterized by their involvement in the structural integrity of hair and nails, which are essential for protecting the body from environmental damage. These proteins are often associated with specific gene clusters that exhibit features typical of dark proteins, such as short length and atypical amino acid composition (Perdigão2019Dark). While the specific function of KRTAP23-1 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its role in hair and nail structure is well recognized within the broader context of keratin-associated proteins (Perdigão2019Dark).
