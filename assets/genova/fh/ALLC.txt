# ALLC

## Overview
The ALLC gene encodes the enzyme allantoicase, which is part of the uric-acid-degrading enzyme family. Allantoicase is involved in the catabolism of purines, specifically in the conversion of allantoic acid to urea and glyoxylic acid. In humans, the ALLC gene is characterized by a sequence that shows high similarity to the allantoicase gene in other species, such as Xenopus laevis, although it appears to be nonfunctional due to incorrect splicing and mutational events (Vigetti2000Human). The gene comprises 11 exons and produces transcripts in the testis, but no enzymatic activity has been detected, suggesting that the protein may not be functional in humans (Vigetti2002Genomic). Despite its lack of activity, the gene's structure is conserved, indicating a potential evolutionary remnant of a once-functional gene (Vigetti2000Human).

## Structure
The human allantoicase (ALLC) gene encodes a protein that is part of the uric-acid-degrading enzyme family. The primary structure of the human allantoicase protein is derived from a cDNA sequence that shows high identity with the Xenopus laevis allantoicase at the 3' end, but diverges at the 5' end, suggesting a truncated protein due to incorrect splicing (Vigetti2000Human). The virtual translation of the human cDNA results in a 219 amino acid sequence that aligns with other known allantoicases, sharing conserved motifs such as DGWET and PDGGV, although these motifs are not found in functional domain databases (Vigetti2000Human).

The human allantoicase gene consists of 11 exons, and its structure is well conserved compared to the mouse gene, although there are differences in intron sizes and upstream sequences (Vigetti2002Genomic). The gene produces two different transcripts in the testis, one starting inside intron 6 and another starting with exon 2, potentially coding for smaller proteins lacking an N-terminus portion (Vigetti2002Genomic). Despite the transcription of the gene, no allantoicase activity is detected in humans, suggesting that the gene may be nonfunctional due to mutational events (Vigetti2000Human).
