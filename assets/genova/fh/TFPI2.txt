# TFPI2

## Overview
Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor 2 (TFPI2) is a gene located on chromosome 7q22, encoding a Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor protein known as tissue factor pathway inhibitor-2 (TFPI-2). This protein plays a pivotal role in maintaining extracellular matrix (ECM) integrity by inhibiting various serine proteases and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), thereby regulating proteolytic activity and contributing to vascular homeostasis (Sierko2007The; Wojtukiewicz2024Tissue). TFPI-2 is synthesized in multiple tissues and secreted into the ECM, where it exerts its biological functions, including the inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis (Wojtukiewicz2024Tissue). The gene's expression is often altered in various cancers, where it acts as a tumor suppressor, and its downregulation is associated with poor clinical outcomes, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Nigro2013Methylated; Xu2013Low).

## Structure
Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor-2 (TFPI-2) is a multivalent Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor. The TFPI-2 protein consists of a short acidic N-terminal region, three tandem Kunitz inhibitor domains, and a C-terminal basic region (Wojtukiewicz2024Tissue). The first Kunitz domain is responsible for its inhibitory activity on serine proteases, utilizing the P1 arginine residue (Arg-24) for inhibition (Wojtukiewicz2024Tissue). TFPI-2 is present in three glycosylated forms, with molecular weights of 27 kDa, 31 kDa, and 33 kDa, depending on the nature of glycosylation (Wojtukiewicz2024Tissue).

The TFPI-2 gene is located on chromosome 7 in the 7q22 region and consists of five exons and four introns (Wojtukiewicz2024Tissue). While specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not provided, the presence of Kunitz-type domains suggests a typical fold associated with serine protease inhibitors. The protein is synthesized in various tissues, including keratinocytes, dermal fibroblasts, placenta, liver, heart, and kidney, and is secreted into the extracellular matrix (Kato2024Tissue; Wojtukiewicz2024Tissue). The context does not provide information on splice variant isoforms or other post-translational modifications beyond glycosylation.

## Function
Tissue factor pathway inhibitor-2 (TFPI-2) is a Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor that plays a crucial role in regulating extracellular matrix (ECM) integrity and proteolytic activity in healthy human cells. It is primarily synthesized by endothelial cells of small blood vessels and secreted into the ECM, where it inhibits a variety of serine proteinases, including plasmin, plasma kallikrein, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and factor XIa (Sierko2007The; Wojtukiewicz2024Tissue). TFPI-2 is involved in maintaining ECM stability by inhibiting matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) such as MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-13, which are responsible for ECM degradation (Herman2001Tissue; Wojtukiewicz2024Tissue).

In the vascular system, TFPI-2 is detected in the vascular endothelium and is involved in regulating proteolytic activity, cell migration, and proliferation, contributing to vascular homeostasis (Crawley2002Expression). It also plays a role in limiting the coagulation cascade and thrombin generation, indirectly down-regulating platelet aggregation and activation (Wojtukiewicz2024Tissue). TFPI-2's antiproliferative effects are mediated through the inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis, which are crucial for maintaining tissue stability and preventing abnormal cell proliferation (Wojtukiewicz2024Tissue).

## Clinical Significance
The TFPI2 gene is implicated in various cancers due to its role as a tumor suppressor. In melanoma, TFPI2 is often silenced through methylation, particularly in metastatic cases, making it a potential biomarker for detecting metastatic melanoma (Nigro2013Methylated; Nobeyama2007Silencing). In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), TFPI2 expression is reduced, often due to promoter hypermethylation, which correlates with advanced stages and lymph node metastases (Rollin2005Expression). Similarly, in thyroid cancer, TFPI2 is downregulated due to promoter hypermethylation, and its overexpression can suppress tumor growth (Yang2020Tissue).

In breast cancer, low TFPI2 expression is associated with poor survival outcomes, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Xu2013Low). TFPI2 is also frequently silenced in hepatocellular carcinoma through epigenetic mechanisms, contributing to tumor progression (Wong2007Tissue). In gastric cancer, TFPI2 downregulation is linked to poor clinical outcomes, with its expression suppressed by both promoter methylation and miR-27a-3p regulation (Geng2020Low). These findings highlight the clinical significance of TFPI2 in cancer diagnosis and prognosis, as well as its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor-2 (TFPI-2) is known to interact with several proteins, influencing various biological processes. One significant interaction is with ADAMTS1, an extracellular metalloproteinase. ADAMTS1 cleaves TFPI-2 at its C-terminal domain, altering its extracellular location and binding properties. This interaction does not inhibit ADAMTS1's proteolytic activity but modifies TFPI-2's distribution in the extracellular matrix (ECM) (TorresCollado2006ADAMTS1). 

TFPI-2 also interacts with matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), such as MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-13, inhibiting their activity and thereby stabilizing the ECM. This inhibition is crucial in limiting tumor invasion and metastasis (Wojtukiewicz2024Tissue). 

Another notable interaction is with prosaposin (PSAP), where TFPI-2's second Kunitz-type domain (KD2) binds to PSAP, mediating the inhibition of invasion and migration in human fibrosarcoma cells (Xu2011The). 

TFPI-2 is also involved in intracellular signaling, interacting with transcription factors like AP-2α in the nucleus to modulate gene expression, including the silencing of the MMP-2 gene (Wojtukiewicz2024Tissue). These interactions highlight TFPI-2's role in regulating ECM remodeling and its potential implications in cancer biology.
