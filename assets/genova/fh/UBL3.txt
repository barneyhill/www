# UBL3

## Overview
UBL3 (ubiquitin-like 3) is a gene that encodes a ubiquitin-like protein involved in various cellular processes, including protein ubiquitination and sorting. The UBL3 protein is characterized by a ubiquitin-fold domain and a CAAX motif, which are essential for its structural stability and function. As a membrane-anchored protein, UBL3 plays a crucial role in post-translational modifications, such as geranylgeranylation, facilitating its localization to the plasma membrane and multivesicular bodies (MVBs) (Takanashi2022Ubiquitinlike). Functionally, UBL3 is involved in the MARCH1-mediated ubiquitination pathway, influencing the surface expression of immune-related proteins like MHC II and CD86 (Liu2022Ubiquitinlike). Additionally, UBL3 is implicated in the sorting of proteins to small extracellular vesicles (sEVs), which are vital for intercellular communication and have significant implications in cancer progression and neurodegenerative diseases (Zhang2023A; Ageta2018UBL3). The gene's expression and interactions are of clinical interest, particularly in the context of various cancers and neurodegenerative disorders (Zhang2023A; Takanashi2022Ubiquitinlike).

## Structure
UBL3 (ubiquitin-like 3) is a protein characterized by its well-conserved structure across eukaryotes, excluding yeasts. The primary structure of human UBL3 consists of 117 amino acids, featuring a ubiquitin-fold domain from residues 10 to 88 and a CAAX sequence at the carboxyl-terminal end, composed of cysteine (C), valine (V), isoleucine (I), and leucine (L) (Takanashi2022Ubiquitinlike). The secondary structure includes α-helix and β-sheet elements arranged in a ββαβββ order, forming a 'β-grasp' tertiary structure typical of ubiquitin-fold domains (Takanashi2022Ubiquitinlike). This structure is highly stable and shared with other ubiquitin-like proteins.

UBL3 is involved in post-translational modifications, such as geranylgeranylation, which anchor it to the plasma membrane or multivesicular bodies (MVBs) (Takanashi2022Ubiquitinlike). The CAAX sequence is crucial for these modifications, with the cysteine residues playing a significant role in protein modification and prenylation (Takanashi2022Ubiquitinlike). UBL3 also contains an isoleucine-centered hydrophobic patch within its ubiquitin-fold, serving as a noncovalent interaction site for α-helical ubiquitin-binding domains (UBDs) (Takanashi2022Ubiquitinlike). These structural features contribute to UBL3's function in protein sorting to small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) and its interaction with other proteins.

## Function
UBL3 (ubiquitin-like protein 3) is a critical component in the regulation of protein ubiquitination and sorting in healthy human cells. It is involved in the MARCH1-mediated ubiquitination of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) and CD86, which are essential for immune function. UBL3 facilitates the recruitment of E2 enzymes to membrane sites, enabling the transfer of ubiquitin to these substrates, thereby regulating their surface expression on antigen-presenting cells (Liu2022Ubiquitinlike).

UBL3 is also implicated in the sorting of proteins to small extracellular vesicles (sEVs), such as exosomes, which are crucial for intercellular communication. It acts as a post-translational modification factor, modifying target proteins through disulfide bonding, which is essential for their sorting to multivesicular bodies and sEVs (Ageta2018UBL3). This function is significant for maintaining cellular homeostasis and influencing processes like tumor progression and metastasis (Zhang2023A).

In terms of cellular localization, UBL3 is a membrane-anchored protein, with its activity dependent on prenylation, which anchors it to membrane sites where it performs its regulatory functions (Liu2022Ubiquitinlike). Its expression is widespread in various tissues, including the brain, testis, and ovary, indicating its broad role in cellular processes (Liu2022Ubiquitinlike).

## Clinical Significance
The UBL3 gene has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In gastric cancer, UBL3 is significantly downregulated, and its interacting proteins, such as ICAM-1 and CD44, are involved in cancer progression and metastasis (Zhang2023A). In pancreatic cancer, UBL3 is part of a three-gene risk profile for predicting patient survival, with its expression downregulated in high-risk groups (Zhang2023A). UBL3 is also associated with esophageal cancer, where promoter methylation and downregulation occur, potentially predicting recurrence and survival in early-stage cervical cancer (Zhang2023A).

In non-small-cell lung cancer, UBL3 expression is downregulated and positively correlated with patient survival, suggesting a role in maintaining immune function (Zhang2023A). In breast cancer, UBL3 is identified as a susceptibility locus, particularly in high-risk cases without BRCA1/2 mutations (Zhang2023A). UBL3's involvement in protein sorting to small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) is crucial for cancer progression, as these vesicles transport oncogenic proteins like Ras, influencing tumor growth and metastasis (Ageta2018UBL3). The gene's role in neurodegenerative diseases is also noted, with interactions affecting the transport of disease-related proteins (Takanashi2022Ubiquitinlike).

## Interactions
UBL3 (ubiquitin-like 3) is involved in various protein interactions, playing a significant role in cellular processes. In the mouse brain, UBL3 interacts with numerous proteins, including RNA-binding proteins such as FUS and HPRT1, which are associated with neurodegenerative diseases, and LYPLA1, linked to Huntington's disease (Ageta2024Comprehensive). UBL3 also interacts with α-synuclein, a protein implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, as demonstrated in HEK293 cells using a split luciferase complementation assay and co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Chen2023UBL3).

UBL3 is a critical component of the MARCH1-mediated ubiquitination machinery, affecting the ubiquitination of MHC II and CD86 in both human and mouse cells. It acts as a co-factor for MARCH1, potentially recruiting E2 enzymes to membrane sites to facilitate ubiquitination (Liu2022Ubiquitinlike). UBL3's interaction with E2 enzymes, particularly those in the group VI family related to the mammalian UBE2D E2 family, is crucial for its function in ubiquitin transfer (Liu2022Ubiquitinlike).

UBL3 also plays a role in the sorting of proteins to small extracellular vesicles (sEVs), interacting with proteins such as Ras and its oncogenic mutant RasG12V, enhancing their sorting to sEVs (Ageta2018UBL3). These interactions highlight UBL3's involvement in both neurodegenerative and oncogenic processes.
