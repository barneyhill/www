# CYB5R4

## Overview
The CYB5R4 gene encodes cytochrome b5 reductase 4, a multi-domain redox enzyme that plays a critical role in cellular electron transfer processes. This enzyme is categorized as a reductase and is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it is involved in lipid metabolism and oxidative stress response. Cytochrome b5 reductase 4 facilitates electron transfer from NAD(P)H to FAD and subsequently to heme, which is essential for fatty acid desaturation and other redox reactions. The protein's structure includes distinct domains such as a heme-binding b5 domain and a FAD-binding b5R domain, which are crucial for its function as an electron donor. Mutations and alterations in CYB5R4 have been associated with various diseases, including cancer, obesity-related syndromes, and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its significance in human health (Deng2011Structural; Erdogan2020Genome‑wide; Xu2011Ncb5or).

## Structure
The CYB5R4 gene encodes the Ncb5or protein, a multi-domain redox enzyme involved in electron transfer processes. Ncb5or is composed of four distinct domains: a novel N-terminal region, a heme-binding b5 domain, a CHORD-SGT1 (CS) domain, and a FAD-binding b5R domain (Deng2011Structural). The N-terminal region is intrinsically disordered but forms a helical motif upon interaction with the b5 domain (Zhu2023The). The b5 domain is homologous to microsomal cytochrome b5 and features a unique heme environment with a tetragonally distorted heme, characterized by the perpendicular orientation of the heme-ligating His residues (Deng2011Structural).

The CS domain, related to the heat shock protein 20 family, facilitates inter-domain interactions and electron transfer (Deng2011Structural). The b5R domain is homologous to cytochrome b5 reductase and is involved in electron transfer from NAD(P)H to FAD and then to heme (Deng2011Structural). The protein's structure allows it to function as an electron transfer agent, with specific residues in the N-terminal region, such as Trp 37, playing a crucial role in maintaining the tertiary structure necessary for electron transfer (Deng2011Structural). The protein is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and is implicated in fatty acid desaturation (Deng2011Structural).

## Function
The CYB5R4 gene encodes the Ncb5or protein, a multi-domain redox enzyme involved in electron transfer processes within cells. Ncb5or is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism and oxidative stress response. It functions as an electron donor in the stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) reaction, which is essential for fatty acid desaturation. This process is vital for maintaining proper lipid metabolism, as evidenced by the impaired SCD activity and early-onset diabetes observed in mice lacking the Ncb5or gene (Deng2011Structural; Larade2008Loss).

Ncb5or contains cytochrome b5 and cytochrome b5 reductase domains, facilitating electron transfer from NAD(P)H to FAD and then to heme, reducing ferric iron to ferrous. This electron transfer capability allows Ncb5or to act as a potent electron donor, participating in various redox reactions (Deng2011Structural; Zhu2004NCB5OR). The protein is also involved in protecting cells from oxidative stress, particularly in the context of saturated fatty acid exposure, by regulating fatty acid metabolism and enhancing mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (Xu2011Ncb5or).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CYB5R4 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of ovarian cancer, CYB5R4 has been found to be hypomethylated in individuals with the disease, suggesting a potential role in its development (Erdogan2020Genome‑wide). Although the specific function of CYB5R4 in cancer remains unclear, it has been reported to be mutated in patients with breast cancer (Erdogan2020Genome‑wide).

CYB5R4 is also associated with obesity-related syndromes. A deletion in the 6q14.1q15 region, which includes CYB5R4, has been linked to obesity, developmental delay, and a distinctive clinical phenotype characterized by motor delay and craniofacial abnormalities (D’Angelo2012Copy).

In the realm of neurodevelopmental disorders, CYB5R4 has been identified as a novel gene associated with these conditions, including epilepsy and pervasive developmental disorders of autism (Suzuki2020A; Dmytriw2023Genetic). Alterations in CYB5R4 expression have been linked to locomotor abnormalities and altered proprioception, particularly in iron-deficient models (Dmytriw2023Genetic).

These findings suggest that CYB5R4 plays a significant role in various pathological conditions, although its precise mechanisms and interactions require further investigation.
