# TNNC1

## Overview
The TNNC1 gene encodes the protein troponin C1, slow skeletal and cardiac type, which is a critical component of the troponin complex involved in the regulation of muscle contraction. This protein functions as a calcium-binding regulatory protein, playing a pivotal role in the contraction of cardiac and slow skeletal muscles by modulating the interaction between actin and myosin filaments. Troponin C1 is categorized as a calcium-binding protein due to its EF-hand motifs, which are essential for its function in calcium-mediated signaling pathways (van2019Cardiac; Li2015Structure). The TNNC1 gene's expression and the protein's structural integrity are vital for maintaining normal cardiac function, and mutations in this gene have been implicated in various cardiomyopathies, highlighting its clinical significance (Parvatiyar2012A; Hershberger2010Coding).

## Structure
The TNNC1 gene encodes the cardiac troponin C (cTnC) protein, which plays a crucial role in muscle contraction regulation. The primary structure of cTnC consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its functional domains. The secondary structure of cTnC includes EF-hand motifs, which are helix-loop-helix structures that facilitate calcium binding, essential for its regulatory function in muscle contraction (van2019Cardiac; Sogah2010Distinct).

The tertiary structure of cTnC is globular, allowing it to interact effectively with other components of the troponin complex. This structure is critical for the conformational changes that occur upon calcium binding, which in turn regulate the interaction between actin and myosin filaments in muscle fibers (van2019Cardiac).

In terms of quaternary structure, cTnC interacts with troponin I (cTnI) and troponin T (cTnT) to form the troponin complex, which is integral to the regulation of muscle contraction. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can affect the function of cTnC by altering its calcium sensitivity, which is particularly relevant in the context of heart failure and cardiomyopathies (van2019Cardiac; Sogah2010Distinct).

## Function
The TNNC1 gene encodes cardiac troponin C (cTnC), a protein integral to the regulation of muscle contraction in cardiac and slow skeletal muscles. cTnC is a component of the troponin complex, which includes troponin I (TnI) and troponin T (TnT), and plays a crucial role in calcium-mediated regulation of muscle contraction (Reinoso2020A; Parvatiyar2012A). In healthy human cells, cTnC functions as a calcium sensor. It contains two domains: the N-domain, which has a low-affinity calcium-binding site crucial for muscle contraction, and the C-domain, which has high-affinity calcium and magnesium binding sites that stabilize the troponin complex (Parvatiyar2012A; Li2015Structure).

Upon an increase in intracellular calcium levels, calcium ions bind to the N-domain of cTnC, inducing a conformational change that facilitates the interaction with TnI. This interaction allows the troponin-tropomyosin complex to shift, exposing myosin-binding sites on actin filaments, which is essential for muscle contraction (Reinoso2020A; Martins2015In). This process is vital for the contraction and relaxation phases of the cardiac cycle, ensuring proper heart function (Martins2015In). The TNNC1 gene's expression is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and function of cardiac muscle (Sogah2010Distinct).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TNNC1 gene, which encodes cardiac troponin C, are associated with several cardiomyopathies, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM). HCM is characterized by unexplained hypertrophy of the left ventricle and is a common cause of sudden death in young athletes. Specific mutations such as A31S and A8V increase the calcium sensitivity of the myofilament, potentially leading to arrhythmogenesis and cardiac remodeling (Parvatiyar2012A; Martins2015In). The A31S mutation has been linked to ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death (Parvatiyar2012A).

In DCM, mutations like G159D and D145E affect calcium-binding affinity and the phosphorylation effect of cardiac troponin I, leading to decreased left ventricular ejection fraction and ventricular dilation (Li2015Structure; Pinto2011Functional). The D145E mutation, in particular, has been associated with both HCM and DCM phenotypes (Hershberger2010Coding).

RCM, a rare pediatric cardiac disease, has been linked to compound heterozygosity for TNNC1 mutations, such as A8V and D145E, which can lead to fatal outcomes in infancy (Ploski2016Evidence). These mutations highlight the complex role of TNNC1 in cardiac diseases, with varying effects on calcium sensitivity and muscle contraction.

## Interactions
The TNNC1 gene encodes cardiac troponin C (cTnC), a critical component of the troponin complex involved in muscle contraction regulation. cTnC interacts with cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and cardiac troponin T (cTnT) within this complex. These interactions are essential for the calcium-dependent regulation of muscle contraction. The binding of calcium ions to cTnC induces conformational changes that facilitate its interaction with cTnI, which in turn modulates the actin-myosin interactions necessary for muscle contraction (Li2015Structure).

Mutations in TNNC1 can alter these interactions, affecting cardiac function. For instance, the cTnC-I4M variant shows tighter binding to cTnT, which may modulate calcium activation of force and affect the troponin I switching mechanism of muscle contraction (Johnston2019The). Another variant, cTnC-G34S, exhibits decreased binding affinity towards cTnT, disrupting the interaction within the troponin complex and impairing the transmission of the Ca2+ signal (Hassoun2021De). These altered interactions can lead to contractile dysregulation and contribute to cardiomyopathy (Hassoun2021De).
