# TMEM82

## Overview
TMEM82 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 82, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. TMEM82 has garnered attention in the field of oncology due to its potential role as a biomarker in several cancer types, including colorectal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. Its expression patterns and genetic variations have been studied in the context of cancer prognosis and treatment development. Additionally, TMEM82 has been implicated in neurological conditions, such as autism spectrum disorder, highlighting its potential significance in diverse biological pathways and disease mechanisms (Patowary2019Familybased; Lin2013Identification; BerralGonzalez2019OMICfpp:).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
TMEM82 has been identified as a potential biomarker in various cancers. In colorectal cancer (CRC), TMEM82 was proposed as a new candidate gene, with studies suggesting its involvement in CRC and other cancer types (BerralGonzalez2019OMICfpp:). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TMEM82 was highlighted as a novel differentially-expressed gene, although specific diseases or conditions directly associated with its mutations or expression alterations were not detailed. The study emphasized the potential of TMEM82 in improving prognosis and developing new treatment options for HCC (Lin2013Identification).

TMEM82 has also been implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A study using family-based exome sequencing identified TMEM82 as one of the candidate genes potentially associated with ASD, although it was found in only a single family, and specific functional roles were not detailed (Patowary2019Familybased).

In the context of its genomic location, TMEM82 is situated on chromosome 1p36.21, near the SRARP gene, which is involved in various malignancies. However, the specific role or association of TMEM82 with diseases related to this chromosomal region was not elaborated (Naderi2018SRARP).
