# MST1

## Overview
The MST1 gene encodes the macrophage stimulating 1 protein, a serine/threonine kinase that plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including apoptosis, cell proliferation, and immune regulation. As a key component of the Hippo signaling pathway, MST1 is instrumental in controlling organ size and preventing tumorigenesis by modulating the activity of downstream effectors such as Lats1/2 and YAP/TAZ (Zhao2011The). The protein is characterized by its N-terminal kinase domain, an intrinsically disordered inhibitory domain, and a C-terminal SARAH domain, which facilitates dimerization and interaction with other proteins (Galan2016MST1MST2; Constantinescu2011DimerizationInduced). MST1 is also crucial in the immune system, influencing T cell survival, macrophage activation, and cytokine production, thereby playing a significant role in immune responses and inflammatory conditions (Cho2019Mst1Deficiency; Goyette2008Genecentric).

## Structure
The MST1 protein, encoded by the MST1 gene, is a serine/threonine kinase involved in apoptotic signaling pathways. It consists of 487 amino acids and shares over 95% identical catalytic domains with its close paralogue MST2 (Galan2016MST1MST2). The primary structure includes an N-terminal kinase domain, an intrinsically disordered inhibitory domain, and a C-terminal SARAH domain, which is crucial for dimerization and interaction with other proteins (Galan2016MST1MST2; Constantinescu2011DimerizationInduced).

The SARAH domain forms a stable antiparallel helical dimer, essential for MST1's biological activity, including its role in apoptosis and cell growth restriction (Constantinescu2011DimerizationInduced). The inhibitory domain, characterized as an intrinsically disordered region, contributes to the protein's flexibility and does not significantly stabilize upon dimerization (Constantinescu2011DimerizationInduced).

MST1 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation at threonine residue Thr 183, which is crucial for its activation and function in apoptosis (PRASKOVA2004Regulation). The protein can form both homodimers and heterodimers, with the latter exhibiting weaker kinase activity (Galan2016MST1MST2). The SARAH domain's structure, analyzed through NMR, shows a novel fold with a hydrophobic interface, essential for its function (Constantinescu2011DimerizationInduced).

## Function
The MST1 gene encodes a multifunctional serine/threonine kinase involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and organ size regulation. In the context of the Hippo signaling pathway, MST1 plays a crucial role in regulating organ size and preventing tumor formation by phosphorylating and activating Lats1/2, which subsequently inhibit the YAP/TAZ transcription co-activators (Zhao2011The). MST1 is also involved in the immune system, where it regulates the survival, proliferation, trafficking, and function of T cells. It plays a role in the induction of reactive oxygen species to clear bacterial infections in macrophages and in the production of cytokines IL-6 and IL-12 from dendritic cells (Cho2019Mst1Deficiency).

In bone marrow-derived dendritic cells, MST1 negatively regulates the Akt1/c-myc signaling pathway, preventing hyperactivation characterized by increased expression of costimulatory molecules and inflammatory cytokines (Cho2019Mst1Deficiency). MST1 also modulates the immune response by maintaining a moderate maturation phenotype of GM-CSF-induced dendritic cells, highlighting its importance in immune regulation (Cho2019Mst1Deficiency). In the context of inflammatory bowel diseases, MST1 is implicated in regulating innate immune responses and macrophage activation, which is crucial for maintaining intestinal health (Goyette2008Genecentric).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MST1 gene are associated with a range of immunodeficiencies and inflammatory conditions. MST1 deficiency, resulting from mutations in the STK4 gene, leads to a form of autosomal recessive primary immunodeficiency characterized by defective naive T-cell survival. This condition manifests as progressive T-cell immunodeficiency, recurrent bacterial and viral infections, autoimmune manifestations, and defective antibody responses. Patients with MST1 mutations often exhibit CD4 T-cell lymphopenia and a significant reduction in naive CD8 T cells, contributing to severe immunodeficiency (Nehme2012MST1).

MST1 is crucial for lymphocyte trafficking and immune synapse formation. Its deficiency impairs leukocyte adhesion and chemotaxis, leading to combined immunodeficiency (CID) in humans. This impairment is linked to defective lymphocyte migration and increased apoptosis, resulting in profound CD4 lymphopenia and susceptibility to multiple infections (Dang2016Defective).

Additionally, a missense mutation in the MST1 gene has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) pathogenesis. This mutation affects macrophage chemotaxis and activation, suggesting a role for MST1 in inflammatory processes and IBD susceptibility (Goyette2008Genecentric).
