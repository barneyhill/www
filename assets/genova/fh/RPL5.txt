# RPL5

## Overview
RPL5 is a gene that encodes the ribosomal protein L5, a vital component of the 60S subunit of eukaryotic ribosomes. This protein plays a critical role in ribosome biogenesis, particularly in the maturation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and the assembly of functional ribosomes. As a structural constituent of the ribosome, ribosomal protein L5 is involved in the nucleolar processing of rRNA precursors and the maintenance of nucleolar integrity, which are essential for efficient protein synthesis and cellular homeostasis (Matsumori2022Ribosomal; Robledo2008The). Beyond its structural role, ribosomal protein L5 is implicated in the regulation of the MDM2-p53 pathway, contributing to tumor suppression by stabilizing p53 and promoting apoptosis in response to ribosomal stress (Zhou2015Ribosomal). Mutations in the RPL5 gene are associated with Diamond-Blackfan Anemia, highlighting its clinical significance in both genetic disorders and cancer (Zhang2022Ribosomal; Gazda2008Ribosomal).

## Function
Ribosomal protein L5 (RPL5) is a crucial component of the 60S subunit of the ribosome, playing a significant role in ribosome biogenesis and function in healthy human cells. RPL5 is involved in the nucleolar processing of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) precursors, particularly in the maturation of 28S and 5.8S rRNA, which are essential for the assembly of functional ribosomes (Robledo2008The). It facilitates the bundling of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) arrays within the nucleolus, a process critical for the reformation of the nucleolus after mitosis and for efficient rRNA transcription and processing (Matsumori2022Ribosomal).

RPL5 also plays a role in maintaining nucleolar integrity and morphology. Its depletion leads to aberrant nucleolar structures and impaired rRNA processing, highlighting its importance in nucleolar assembly and function (Matsumori2022Ribosomal). Beyond its role in ribosome assembly, RPL5 is involved in the regulation of the MDM2-p53 feedback loop, contributing to tumor suppression by inhibiting MDM2-mediated p53 degradation, thus promoting cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to ribosomal stress (Zhou2015Ribosomal). These functions underscore RPL5's essential role in cellular homeostasis and protein synthesis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RPL5 gene are significantly associated with Diamond-Blackfan Anemia (DBA), a rare genetic disorder characterized by macrocytic anemia and congenital anomalies such as cleft palate and abnormal thumbs. These mutations include nonsense, missense, splice site, and small indels, which can lead to premature termination of protein synthesis and are found in approximately 9% of DBA patients (Gazda2008Ribosomal). A specific de novo frameshift mutation, c.392dup, p.(Asn131Lysfs*6), has been linked to classical DBA phenotypes and worsening anemia, requiring interventions like red blood cell transfusions and steroid treatments (Dorenkamp2023A).

RPL5 mutations can also disrupt erythropoiesis by affecting the expression of the erythroid transcription factor GATA1 and the function of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), leading to increased p53 levels and cell cycle arrest (Dorenkamp2023A). In addition to DBA, alterations in RPL5 expression have been implicated in cancer. RPL5 is overexpressed in colon cancer, promoting cell proliferation and migration through the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2022Ribosomal).

## Interactions
RPL5, a component of the 60S ribosomal subunit, interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in ribosome assembly and function. It forms a complex with 5S rRNA and ribosomal protein L11 (RPL11) as part of the Rpf2 subcomplex, which is essential for the recruitment of these components into nascent ribosomes and the maturation of 66S preribosomes (Zhang2007Assembly). RPL5 also interacts with nucleophosmin (NPM), which is necessary for its nuclear export. This interaction is crucial for the maturation and export of the 60S ribosomal subunit (Yu2006Nucleophosmin).

RPL5 is involved in the MDM2-p53 signaling pathway. It can bind to MDM2, inhibiting MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of the tumor suppressor protein p53, thereby stabilizing p53 and enhancing its transcriptional activity (Dai2004Inhibition). This interaction is part of a complex regulatory mechanism that involves other ribosomal proteins such as L11 and L23, which also associate with MDM2 to modulate p53 activity (Dai2004Inhibition). These interactions highlight RPL5's role in linking ribosome biogenesis with cell cycle regulation and stress responses.
