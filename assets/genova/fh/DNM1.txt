# DNM1

## Overview
The DNM1 gene encodes the protein dynamin 1, a neuron-specific large GTPase that plays a pivotal role in synaptic vesicle recycling, particularly during high neuronal activity. Dynamin 1 is primarily expressed in the central nervous system, where it facilitates the fission of clathrin-coated vesicles from the plasma membrane, a critical step in synaptic vesicle endocytosis. The protein is characterized by its complex structure, comprising multiple domains, including the GTPase domain, pleckstrin homology domain, and proline-rich domain, which are essential for its function in membrane fission and interaction with other proteins. Dynamin 1's activity is tightly regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which modulate its GTPase activity and interactions with endocytic proteins. Mutations in the DNM1 gene are linked to severe neurological disorders, including epileptic encephalopathy, underscoring the gene's clinical significance (Li2019Clinical; Ferguson2007A; Prichard2022Role).

## Structure
The DNM1 gene encodes the dynamin 1 protein, which is a large GTPase involved in synaptic vesicle recycling. The primary structure of dynamin 1 consists of 864 amino acids and is organized into five distinct domains: the N-terminal GTPase domain, the middle domain, the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, the GTPase effector domain (GED), and the proline-rich domain (PRD) (Appenzeller2014De; Afsar2023Truncated).

The secondary structure of dynamin 1 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the folding and stability of the protein. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains into a functional conformation, allowing dynamin 1 to perform its role in membrane fission events (Boumil2010A).

In terms of quaternary structure, dynamin 1 can form tetramers or higher-order oligomers, which are essential for its function in synaptic vesicle endocytosis. The middle domain is particularly important for oligomerization, facilitating the assembly of dynamin 1 into these multimeric structures (Boumil2010A).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, regulate the activity of dynamin 1, influencing its role in synaptic vesicle recycling. The gene also produces various isoforms through alternative splicing, which may result in proteins with distinct functions (Boumil2010A; Afsar2023Truncated).

## Function
Dynamin 1 (DNM1) is a neuron-specific GTPase enzyme that plays a critical role in synaptic vesicle endocytosis, particularly during high levels of neuronal activity. It is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, especially in presynaptic nerve terminals, where it facilitates the fission of clathrin-coated vesicles from the plasma membrane, a crucial step in synaptic vesicle recycling (Ferguson2007A; Prichard2022Role). 

During intense neuronal stimulation, dynamin 1 undergoes Ca2+-dependent dephosphorylation, enhancing its recruitment to endocytic sites and supporting efficient synaptic vesicle recycling (Ferguson2007A). This process is essential for maintaining synaptic transmission by ensuring a continuous supply of neurotransmitter-filled vesicles (Prichard2022Role). 

Dynamin 1 is involved in both clathrin-dependent and independent endocytic pathways, and its activity is regulated through phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, which modulate its GTPase activity and interactions with other endocytic proteins (Prichard2022Role). The protein's structure includes a GTPase domain, which is crucial for its function in membrane fission events, and a pleckstrin-homology domain that aids in membrane localization (Prichard2022Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DNM1 gene are associated with epileptic encephalopathy, a severe neurological disorder characterized by frequent seizures and significant developmental delays. These mutations often lead to early onset epileptic syndromes such as West and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes, with symptoms typically appearing around five months of age. Patients with DNM1-related encephalopathy frequently exhibit severe neurodevelopmental symptoms, including being nonverbal and non-ambulatory, with developmental delays often preceding seizure onset (Li2019Clinical).

The majority of individuals with DNM1 mutations experience refractory seizures, which are resistant to standard antiepileptic treatments. EEG abnormalities are common, with 96.7% of patients showing varied epileptiform discharges (Li2019Clinical). The mutations in DNM1 are primarily found in the GTPase or middle domains of the protein, which are crucial for its function in the synaptic vesicle cycle. These mutations disrupt normal synaptic transmission, contributing to the severe clinical phenotypes observed (Li2019Clinical).

The clinical management of DNM1-related disorders is challenging due to the limited efficacy of available treatments, highlighting the need for further research into potential therapeutic strategies (Li2019Clinical).

## Interactions
Dynamin 1 (DNM1) is involved in various protein-protein interactions essential for its role in endocytosis and synaptic vesicle recycling. The GTPase Effector Domain (GED) of DNM1 interacts with the GTPase domain, the middle domain (MD), and itself to form homodimers, facilitating dynamin self-assembly (Prichard2022Role). The Pleckstrin-Homology (PH) domain of DNM1 binds to lipids, particularly phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), which enhances its GTPase activity and is crucial for membrane localization (Prichard2022Role).

DNM1's Proline-Rich Domain (PRD) contains binding sites for SH3 domain-containing proteins such as amphiphysin, endophilin, and sorting nexin 9 (SNX9), which facilitate its recruitment to membranes and coordinate its function during endocytosis (Antonny2016Membrane; Prichard2022Role). These interactions are critical for membrane curvature and fission processes. DNM1 also interacts with actin and microtubule networks, aiding in vesicle trafficking and cellular dynamics (Prichard2022Role).

In human sperm, DNM1 interacts with proteins like CDK1 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, suggesting a role in acrosomal exocytosis (Zhou2017Characterization). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of DNM1 in cellular processes.
