# NOTUM

## Overview
NOTUM is a gene that encodes the enzyme palmitoleoyl-protein carboxylesterase, a member of the carboxylesterase family, which plays a pivotal role in modulating the Wnt signaling pathway. The NOTUM protein functions as an extracellular enzyme that deacylates Wnt proteins by removing the palmitoleate group, thereby influencing their activity and stability. This enzymatic activity is crucial for regulating various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. NOTUM also interacts with glypicans, acting as a glypican-dependent Wnt inhibitor, and is involved in the release of glypicans and other GPI-anchored proteins from the cell surface, affecting cell signaling and interactions. The expression of NOTUM is observed in multiple tissues, such as the lung, ovary, kidney, liver, and brain, indicating its involvement in diverse physiological and developmental processes (Traister2008Mammalian).

## Structure
The NOTUM protein is characterized by a 'canonical' α/β-hydrolase superfamily fold, which includes a conserved core structure comprising an 8-stranded β-sheet flanked by α-helices and loops on both sides (Zhao2020Structural). This structure is typical of enzymes in the α/β-hydrolase family, which often feature a catalytic triad. In NOTUM, this triad consists of the residues S232, D340, and H389, with S232 acting as the nucleophile located in the 'nucleophilic elbow' region, which includes a consensus hydrolytic sequence G-X-Nu-X-G (Zhao2020Structural).

The protein also possesses a moveable lid domain, comprising the αA, αD, and αE helices and a β6-αD loop, which is involved in the transition between open and closed conformations, a feature common to lipases (Zhao2020Structural). The active site of NOTUM includes a large hydrophobic pocket where substrates like palmitoleic acid bind, and interactions with inhibitors such as melatonin are primarily hydrophobic, involving residues like W128, Y129, V187, and S232 (Zhao2020Structural).

Post-translational modifications of NOTUM may include glycosylation, which can aid in the protein's crystallization process (Zhao2021Structural). The structural insights into NOTUM are crucial for understanding its role in deacylating Wnt proteins and its potential as a target for therapeutic inhibitors.

## Function
NOTUM is a gene encoding the enzyme palmitoleoyl-protein carboxylesterase, which plays a crucial role in modulating Wnt signaling by removing palmitoleate from Wnt proteins. This activity is essential for regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. NOTUM functions as an extracellular enzyme, acting as a glypican-dependent Wnt inhibitor, which influences various signaling pathways, including Wnts, Hedgehogs, BMPs, and fibroblast growth factors (Traister2008Mammalian).

In healthy human cells, NOTUM is involved in the release of glypicans and other GPI-anchored proteins from the cell surface. It acts as a lipase, cleaving the GPI anchor and releasing these proteins into the extracellular environment, thereby modulating cell surface composition and influencing cell signaling and interactions (Traister2008Mammalian). This activity is significant in various physiological processes, such as T-cell activation and cell adhesion (Traister2008Mammalian).

NOTUM's expression is observed in several tissues, including the lung, ovary, kidney, liver, and brain, suggesting its involvement in developmental processes and tissue-specific functions (Traister2008Mammalian). Its role in regulating Wnt signaling and modulating the cell surface composition highlights its importance in maintaining tissue homeostasis and influencing developmental outcomes.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the NOTUM gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly those involving aberrant Wnt signaling. In colorectal cancer (CRC), NOTUM is significantly increased in metastatic cells, promoting cancer cell proliferation and migration. Neutralizing NOTUM reduces these effects, suggesting its role in CRC progression and its potential as a therapeutic target (YOON2018NOTUM). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), NOTUM is upregulated in response to β-catenin activation, indicating its involvement in tumor development through the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (Canal2016Generation).

NOTUM also plays a role in bone biology, where its expression is associated with reduced bone mineral density (BMD). Silencing NOTUM in osteoblasts enhances their differentiation, suggesting that NOTUM acts as a negative regulator of bone formation. Variations in the NOTUM locus are linked to changes in BMD, highlighting its significance in bone health (MovérareSkrtic2019Osteoblast‐derived).

In the context of intestinal tumors, NOTUM expression is enriched in WNT ligand-independent tumors, promoting the expansion of APC-mutant clones by suppressing WNT signaling in adjacent wild-type intestinal stem cells. This suggests its potential as a therapeutic target to prevent clonal fixation and mutant expansion in adenoma development (Flanagan2021NOTUM).

## Interactions
The NOTUM protein, encoded by the human gene NOTUM, is a carboxylesterase that interacts with various proteins, primarily influencing the Wnt signaling pathway. NOTUM deacylates Wnt proteins by removing the palmitoleate group, which is crucial for their activity and stability, thereby modulating Wnt signaling (Zhao2021Structural; Bayle2021Carboxylesterase). This interaction is facilitated by a hydrophobic pocket in NOTUM that accommodates the lipid moiety of Wnt proteins (Bayle2021Carboxylesterase).

NOTUM also interacts with glypicans, which are heparan sulfate proteoglycans involved in cell signaling. It was initially thought to cleave the GPI anchor of glypicans, releasing them from the cell surface, but it is now recognized as a glypican-dependent Wnt deacylase (Traister2008Mammalian; Bayle2021Carboxylesterase). This interaction suggests a role for NOTUM in retaining its activity at the cell surface through interactions with glypicans (Bayle2021Carboxylesterase).

Additionally, NOTUM has been shown to interact with ghrelin, a hormone involved in energy balance, by deacylating its octanoylated form. This interaction is primarily hydrophobic and involves specific residues within the enzyme's pocket (Zhao2021Notum). These interactions highlight NOTUM's role in modulating various signaling pathways through its enzymatic activity.
