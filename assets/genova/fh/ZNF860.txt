# ZNF860

## Overview
ZNF860 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 860, a member of the KRAB-zinc finger protein family, which is characterized by the presence of C2H2-type zinc finger domains. These domains are integral to the protein's function as a transcription factor, enabling it to bind DNA and regulate gene expression. Zinc finger protein 860 is ubiquitously expressed across human tissues, with a notable association with B-cells, suggesting its involvement in a wide range of cellular processes. The gene has undergone positive selection in the human lineage, indicating its potential significance in human evolution and adaptation. ZNF860 has been implicated in various biological pathways and diseases, including dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus, although the precise molecular mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated (Jovanovic2021Positive; Yamada2018Identification).

## Function
ZNF860 is a member of the KRAB-zinc finger protein family, which is known for its role in gene regulation through DNA binding. These proteins typically function as transcription factors, influencing the expression of various genes. ZNF860 contains zinc finger domains, which are crucial for its ability to bind to DNA and regulate transcriptional activity (Jovanovic2021Positive). The protein is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and is associated with B-cells, suggesting a broad role in cellular processes (Jovanovic2021Positive).

The evolutionary analysis of ZNF860 indicates that it has undergone positive selection in the human lineage, highlighting its potential importance in human evolution and adaptation (Jovanovic2021Positive). Despite its evolutionary significance, the specific molecular functions of ZNF860 in cell biology remain unclear. It is part of a rapidly evolving protein family, which may contribute to its involvement in diverse regulatory pathways (Jovanovic2021Positive).

In the context of disease, ZNF860 has been associated with dyslipidemia, particularly hypo-HDL-cholesterolemia, suggesting a potential role in lipid metabolism (Yamada2018Identification). However, the precise mechanisms by which ZNF860 influences these processes are not yet fully understood.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF860 has been identified as a novel susceptibility locus for early-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the ZNF860 gene, rs140232911, has shown a significant association with T2DM, with a P-value of 1.25x10^-8 and an allele odds ratio of 3.67, suggesting a strong genetic link to the disease (Yamada2018Identification). This SNP was not previously associated with T2DM in genome-wide association studies, indicating that ZNF860 may represent a novel finding in the context of T2DM susceptibility (Yamada2018Identification).

In the context of cancer, ZNF860 has been implicated in B-cell lymphomas. Mutations in the promoter regions of ZNF860 may play a role in gene disruption through complementary genetic mechanisms, potentially contributing to oncogenic processes (Mathelier2015Cisregulatory). Additionally, ZNF860 has been suggested as a potential biomarker for papillary carcinomas, although further testing is needed to validate its efficacy as a diagnostic tool for renal neoplasms (DuttaMoscato2014Creating).

Overall, while ZNF860 is associated with certain diseases, its clinical significance requires further research to fully understand its implications and mechanisms.
