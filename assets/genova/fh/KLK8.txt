# KLK8

## Overview
KLK8, or kallikrein-related peptidase 8, is a gene that encodes a trypsin-like serine protease known for its involvement in various physiological processes, particularly within the central nervous system and skin. The protein encoded by KLK8, also referred to as neuropsin, plays a crucial role in synaptic plasticity, brain development, and skin homeostasis. It is highly expressed in the hippocampus, where it contributes to learning and memory by modulating synaptic adhesion molecules and neurotransmission pathways (Mella2020Involvement; Yousef2003Role). In the skin, KLK8 is involved in keratinocyte differentiation and wound healing (Ahmed2016Clinical). The protein's activity is regulated by post-translational modifications and interactions with metal ions, which influence its stability and function (Debela2018Structural). KLK8's dysregulation has been linked to several clinical conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, depression, and diabetic cardiac fibrosis, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Herring2021Genetic; Du2021A; Xu2023Upregulation).

## Structure
KLK8, also known as kallikrein-related peptidase 8, is a trypsin-like serine protease characterized by a distinct molecular structure. The primary structure of KLK8 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain, which is processed from an inactive pro-enzyme to an active form by cleavage at the Lys15-Val16 bond (Debela2018Structural). The secondary structure includes two six-stranded β-barrels that form half-domains, with the catalytic triad of Ser195, His57, and Asp102 located at their interface (Debela2018Structural). 

The tertiary structure of KLK8 is stabilized by six disulfide bridges and features a KLK-specific cis-Pro219 (Debela2018Structural). The N-terminal α-ammonium group of Val16 forms a crucial salt bridge with Asp194, stabilizing the oxyanion hole and shaping the S1 pocket (Debela2018Structural). The protein also contains specificity subsites S4 to S4', which are aligned in the standard orientation (Debela2018Structural).

Post-translational modifications include glycosylation at Asn95, which may contribute to resistance against proteolysis and conformational stability (Debela2018Structural). KLK8 is involved in neural plasticity and memory formation, with its activity modulated by metal ions such as calcium and zinc (Debela2018Structural).

## Function
KLK8, also known as neuropsin, is a serine protease that plays a significant role in the central nervous system, particularly in synaptic plasticity and brain development. It is highly expressed in the hippocampus and other regions of the limbic system, where it is involved in processes such as learning and memory. KLK8 modifies the synaptic adhesion molecule L1, which is crucial for NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity, thereby enhancing long-term potentiation (LTP) (Mella2020Involvement). 

In the central nervous system, KLK8 is implicated in the regulation of neural plasticity and development. It is involved in the modulation of GABA neurotransmission through interactions with neuregulin-1 and its receptor, ErbB4 (Mella2020Involvement). KLK8 also contributes to the remodeling of the extracellular matrix, which is essential for synaptic connectivity and hippocampal networking (Yousef2003Role).

In the skin, KLK8 is involved in the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes and plays a role in skin homeostasis. It is upregulated in response to certain treatments, promoting keratinocyte migration and proliferation, which are important for wound healing (Ahmed2016Clinical; Lundwall2008Kallikreinrelated). KLK8's activity in these tissues underscores its importance in maintaining normal physiological functions.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the KLK8 gene have been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), KLK8 is overexpressed in the brain, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid of patients, with higher levels observed in females. This overexpression is associated with increased amyloid-beta (Aβ) pathology, tau hyper-phosphorylation, and neurovascular dysfunction, suggesting a role in AD progression (Herring2021Genetic; Keyvani2018Higher). Genetic knockdown of KLK8 in mouse models has shown potential therapeutic effects, such as reduced Aβ plaque burden and improved neurovascular function, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target for AD (Herring2021Genetic).

KLK8 is also involved in the pathogenesis of depression. Its upregulation in the hippocampus and other brain regions is linked to neuronal apoptosis and depression-like behaviors in rodent models of chronic stress. KLK8 overexpression exacerbates these effects, while its deficiency provides a protective effect, suggesting that KLK8 modulation could be a therapeutic strategy for depression (Xu2023Upregulation).

Additionally, KLK8 has been associated with diabetic cardiac fibrosis, where its upregulation contributes to endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition and fibrosis in the myocardium, highlighting its role in diabetes-related cardiac complications (Du2021A).

## Interactions
Kallikrein-related peptidase 8 (KLK8) is involved in several protein interactions that influence its role in various physiological and pathological processes. KLK8 interacts with VE-cadherin and plakoglobin in endothelial cells, where it cleaves VE-cadherin, leading to the release of a 30 kDa extracellular fragment. This cleavage promotes the nuclear translocation of plakoglobin, a key component of adherens junctions, and is crucial for endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) (Du2021A). KLK8 also interacts with p53, enhancing its transcriptional activity and promoting the expression of genes involved in tumorigenesis and metastasis. This interaction is significant in the context of diabetic cardiac fibrosis, where KLK8 facilitates the binding of p53 with hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and Smad3, promoting pro-EndMT reprogramming via the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway (Du2021A).

In the nervous system, KLK8 interacts with neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM1), cleaving it and contributing to neuronal apoptosis. This interaction is particularly relevant in the context of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depression, where KLK8-mediated cleavage of NCAM1 leads to decreased NCAM1 levels and increased neuronal apoptosis (Xu2023Upregulation). These interactions highlight KLK8's role in modulating cellular adhesion and signaling pathways, impacting both cardiovascular and neurological health.
