# RBM11

## Overview
RBM11 is a gene that encodes the RNA binding motif protein 11, which is a crucial player in the regulation of alternative splicing, a process essential for generating protein diversity within cells. The protein is characterized by its RNA-binding capabilities, allowing it to influence splice site selection during pre-mRNA processing. This function is predominantly carried out in the nucleus, where RBM11 modulates splicing events that are vital for cell differentiation and development (Li2021The). Beyond its role in normal cellular processes, RBM11 has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly in ovarian cancer, where it promotes tumor cell invasion and metastasis through the activation of the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway (Li2021The). The protein's involvement in these pathways underscores its dual role as both a potential tumor suppressor and promoter, depending on the cellular context (Li2021The).

## Structure


## Function
RBM11 (RNA binding motif protein 11) is involved in the regulation of alternative splicing, a critical process for generating protein diversity in cells. It functions by binding to specific RNA sequences, thereby influencing splice site selection during the processing of pre-mRNA. This activity is primarily localized in the nucleus, where RBM11 modulates the splicing of pre-mRNA, impacting cell differentiation and development (Li2021The).

In the context of cancer, RBM11 has been shown to play a role in promoting tumor cell invasion and metastasis, particularly in ovarian cancer, by activating the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway (Li2021The). However, the specific functions of RBM11 in healthy human cells are not detailed in the provided context. The protein's involvement in alternative splicing suggests it may contribute to normal cellular processes by ensuring the correct expression of various protein isoforms necessary for cellular function and organismal development. Despite its role in cancer, the dual nature of RBM proteins, including RBM11, indicates that they can act as both tumor suppressors and promoters depending on the cellular context (Li2021The).

## Clinical Significance
RBM11 has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in RNA splicing and regulation. In neuroblastoma, RBM11 is upregulated in stage 4 compared to stage 4S, suggesting its involvement in cancer progression (Bell2020Identification). This upregulation may contribute to oncogenic processes by altering the splicing of key transcripts, such as MDM4 and Cyclin D1, to more oncogenic isoforms (Bell2020Identification).

In ovarian cancer, RBM11 is highly expressed and promotes tumor cell invasion and metastasis through the activation of the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway (Li2021The). This suggests that changes in RBM11 expression levels can significantly impact cancer progression and metastasis.

RBM11 is also involved in glioblastoma, where it affects alternative splicing events of MDM4 and Cyclin D1, promoting tumor cell proliferation and drug resistance. Glioblastoma cells secrete extracellular vesicles rich in RBM11, which further influences these splicing events (Wang2020RNA; Tao2024Alternative).

Overall, alterations in RBM11 expression and its interactions with other cellular components are associated with the progression and metastasis of various cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
RBM11 is known to participate in various interactions that influence cancer progression and RNA processing. In ovarian cancer, RBM11 promotes tumor cell invasion and metastasis by activating the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, indicating its role in enhancing cancer cell aggressiveness (Li2021The). In neuroblastoma, RBM11 is upregulated in stage 4 of the disease, suggesting its involvement in the progression of this cancer type, although specific protein interactions in this context are not detailed (Bell2020Identification).

RBM11 is also a paralogue of RBM7 and can associate with proteins such as ZCCHC8 and SAP145. These interactions suggest a potential role in linking RNA splicing and degradation processes, as RBM11 shows a preference for uridine-rich sequences, which may target the NEXT-exosome machinery to intronic RNA for degradation (Falk2016Structure). While the specific interactions of RBM11 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed, its involvement in these pathways highlights its significance in RNA processing and cancer biology.
