# STARD13

## Overview
STARD13, also known as Deleted in Liver Cancer-2 (DLC2), is a gene that encodes the protein StAR-related lipid transfer domain containing 13. This protein is categorized as a Rho GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP) and is characterized by the presence of a START domain, which is essential for lipid binding and transfer. The protein plays a pivotal role in regulating Rho signaling pathways, which are crucial for maintaining cell morphology, motility, and growth. STARD13 is involved in modulating the actin cytoskeleton, influencing cell shape and movement, and is active in the cytoplasm. It is implicated in various biological processes, including epithelial remodeling and organ development, by interacting with Rho GTPases and the MAPK signaling pathway. Alterations in STARD13 expression have been associated with several cancers, highlighting its significance in cancer biology and its potential as a therapeutic target (Petzold2013Rho; Jaafar2020StarD13:; Alpy2005Give).

## Structure
STARD13, also known as DLC2, is a protein characterized by the presence of a START domain, which is crucial for lipid binding and transfer. The protein structure includes a C-terminal START domain, an N-terminal SAM (Sterile Alpha Motif) domain, and a RhoGAP (Rho GTPase-activating protein) domain (Alpy2014START; Alpy2005Give). The START domain adopts a 'helix-grip' fold, featuring a central antiparallel β-sheet gripped by N-terminal and C-terminal α-helices, forming a hydrophobic cavity that accommodates lipid molecules (Thorsell2011Comparative; Alpy2005Give).

The protein's tertiary structure is defined by a conserved domain structure consisting of an alpha/beta 'helix-grip', with a curved antiparallel beta-sheet and two helices near the N- and C-terminus, forming a cavity on the concave side of the sheet (Thorsell2011Comparative). The N-terminal SAM domain is involved in various biological processes, including interactions with eukaryotic elongation factor 1A1 (EF1A1), influencing cell growth and cytoskeletal control (Alpy2014START).

STARD13 has four known isoforms: α, β, γ, and δ, which may influence its function and interactions (NASRALLAH2013Effect). The protein is involved in lipid sensing and binding, with charged lipids potentially serving as its ligands (Alpy2005Give).

## Function
STARD13, also known as StAR-related lipid transfer domain containing 13, functions as a Rho GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP) that plays a critical role in regulating Rho signaling pathways. In healthy human cells, STARD13 is involved in maintaining proper cell morphology, motility, and growth by interacting with Rho GTPases, which are essential for cytoskeletal dynamics. The protein is active in the cytoplasm, where it modulates the actin cytoskeleton and influences cell shape and movement (Petzold2013Rho).

STARD13 is crucial for the spatial and temporal regulation of Rho activity, ensuring coordinated morphogenesis and growth, particularly in the development of the pancreas. It restrains the levels of active Rho proteins, preventing excessive Rho activity that can lead to defects in tissue architecture and organ development (Petzold2013Rho). The protein's role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton is vital for epithelial remodeling, as it facilitates the transition from non-polarized cell masses to organized epithelial monolayers, which is essential for forming branched tubular structures (Petzold2013Rho).

STARD13 also integrates growth and morphogenesis by interacting with the MAPK signaling pathway, which is important for progenitor cell proliferation and organ size determination (Petzold2013Rho). Its regulatory functions are crucial for maintaining the progenitor pool and ensuring proper differentiation, highlighting its importance in tissue development and homeostasis (Petzold2013Rho).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the STARD13 gene, also known as Deleted in Liver Cancer-2 (DLC2), have been implicated in various cancers. STARD13 is frequently downregulated in several cancer types, including breast, lung, and liver cancers, which is often due to gene deletions or epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation (Jaafar2020StarD13:; Al2020Differential). In breast cancer, low expression of STARD13 is associated with increased metastasis, particularly in patients with high ERBB2 expression, suggesting its role as a metastasis suppressor (Basak2017In). The gene is also targeted by miR-125b, which downregulates STARD13, promoting metastasis in breast cancer cells (Tang2012MicroRNA125b).

In lung adenocarcinoma, STARD13 is underexpressed, leading to increased cell proliferation and invasion. It plays a critical role in regulating cell motility and invadopodia formation, with its depletion enhancing invasive capabilities through Cdc42 activation (Al2020Differential). The interaction between STARD13 and long non-coding RNA LINC01089 also affects lung cancer progression, as LINC01089 regulates STARD13 expression by sponging miR-301b-3p (Qian2021LINC01089). These findings highlight the clinical significance of STARD13 in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
STARD13, also known as DLC2, is a Rho GTPase-activating protein that interacts with several proteins and signaling pathways, playing a significant role in cancer biology. It primarily acts as a GAP for RhoA and Cdc42, inhibiting their activity and influencing cytoskeletal dynamics and cell migration (Jaafar2021StarD13; NASRALLAH2013Effect). STARD13's interaction with RhoA and Cdc42 affects cell motility, adhesion, and invasion, as seen in various cancer types, including prostate and colorectal cancers (Jaafar2021StarD13; NASRALLAH2013Effect).

In prostate cancer, STARD13 regulates cell motility and invasion by modulating the activity of Cdc42, which is crucial for matrix degradation and cell invasion (Jaafar2021StarD13). The depletion of STARD13 leads to increased activation of Cdc42, enhancing invasion and matrix degradation (Jaafar2021StarD13). In colorectal cancer, STARD13 knockdown results in decreased activation of RhoA and Cdc42, while slightly increasing Rac1 activation, affecting cell motility and invasion (NASRALLAH2013Effect).

STARD13 also interacts with the Hippo signaling pathway in breast cancer through a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network, influencing the expression of LATS1/2 and modulating YAP/TAZ activity, which affects cancer stem cell traits and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Zheng2018STARD13correlated).
