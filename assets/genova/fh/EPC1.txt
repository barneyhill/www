# EPC1

## Overview
EPC1 (enhancer of polycomb homolog 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. The EPC1 protein is a component of histone acetyltransferase complexes, such as p400/NuA4 and TIP60, which are essential for transcriptional regulation and epigenetic events governing transcriptional activation and repression (Perry2006The). As part of the Epc-N subfamily II proteins, EPC1 plays a significant role in chromatin binding and protein-protein interactions, particularly through its Epc-N domain, which is predicted to form a right-handed orthogonal four-helix bundle (Perry2006The). The protein is active in the nucleus, influencing DNA accessibility to transcription factors and impacting cellular differentiation and development (Barry2022Rap1). EPC1's involvement in various protein interactions and complexes, such as with E2F6 and EZH2, underscores its critical role in processes like DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis (Attwooll2005A). Additionally, EPC1 is implicated in several cancers through gene fusions, highlighting its clinical significance in cancer pathology (Micci2006Consistent; Dermawan2022Expanding).

## Structure
The EPC1 protein is a component of histone acetyltransferase complexes, such as p400/NuA4 and TIP60, which are essential for transcriptional regulation (Perry2006The). It is part of the Epc-N subfamily II proteins, which are implicated in basic epigenetic events governing transcriptional activation and repression (Perry2006The). The Epc-N domain, found in EPC1, is predicted to form a right-handed orthogonal four-helix bundle with extended strands at both termini, similar to the colicin immunity protein (IM) 7 from E. coli (Perry2006The). This domain is involved in protein-protein interactions, particularly in chromatin binding (Perry2006The).

The Epc-N domain is characterized by a specific secondary structure consensus, which includes two short extended strands, four helices, and an additional extended strand (Perry2006The). EPC1 may also interact with Ezh2, a SET domain protein, suggesting its role in both transcriptional activation and repression (Perry2006The). While specific details on the primary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of EPC1 are not provided, the presence of the Epc-N domain suggests a potential chromatin-binding motif (Perry2006The).

## Function
EPC1 (enhancer of polycomb homolog 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. In healthy human cells, EPC1 is a component of the p400/NuA4 and TIP60 H4/H2A histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes, which are crucial for epigenetic events that regulate transcriptional activation and repression (Perry2006The). EPC1 interacts with the transcription factor E2F6 and forms a complex with EZH2, a SET domain protein, indicating its role in both transcriptional activation and repression (Attwooll2005A). This complex is specific to proliferating cells and is involved in cell cycle regulation through transcriptional repression (Attwooll2005A).

EPC1 also acts as a bridge facilitating interactions between E2F6 and EZH2, forming a stable tri-molecular complex that is essential for transcriptional repression (Attwooll2005A). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it influences the accessibility of DNA to transcription factors, impacting cellular differentiation and development (Barry2022Rap1). EPC1's involvement in these complexes suggests its significant role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation, contributing to processes such as DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis (Perry2006The).

## Clinical Significance
The EPC1 gene is implicated in various cancers through its involvement in gene fusions and chromatin remodeling. In endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS), EPC1 is frequently involved in gene fusions with PHF1, EED, and EZH2, contributing to tumor pathogenesis. The EPC1-PHF1 fusion results in the entire PHF1 coding region being regulated by the EPC1 promoter, suggesting altered regulation of PHF1 may drive malignancy (Chiang2011Cytogenetic; Micci2006Consistent). The EPC1-EED and EPC1-EZH2 fusions are associated with specific histopathological features and clinical outcomes in ESS, indicating a role in tumor development and progression (Dermawan2022Expanding).

EPC1 is also involved in other gene fusions, such as EPC1-PHC2 in hemangioendotheliomas, suggesting a role in the molecular heterogeneity of these vascular tumors (Torrence2021The). While the specific diseases or conditions associated with EPC1 mutations or expression changes are not detailed, its involvement in chromatin modification and gene expression regulation suggests that disruptions in EPC1 function can contribute to oncogenesis (Visani2021Molecular). The role of EPC1 in these gene fusions highlights its clinical significance in cancer pathology.

## Interactions
EPC1 (enhancer of polycomb homolog 1) is involved in several protein-protein interactions that play a crucial role in skeletal muscle differentiation. EPC1 interacts with the serum response factor (SRF), enhancing SRF-induced expression of muscle-specific genes. This interaction is essential for the binding of the EPC1-SRF complex to the serum response element (SRE) of the skeletal α-actin promoter, facilitating muscle differentiation (Kim2009Enhancer).

EPC1 also interacts with the histone acetyltransferase p300, which is necessary for the acetylation of histones associated with the SRE. This interaction is crucial for EPC1-mediated histone acetylation, as demonstrated by reduced acetylation in cells with decreased p300 levels (Kim2009Enhancer).

In addition to its interaction with SRF and p300, EPC1 binds to the homeodomain-only protein (HOP). This interaction is significant for muscle differentiation, as EPC1 and HOP co-localize in the nucleus and together enhance the expression of myogenin, a key transcription factor in myoblast differentiation (Kee2007Enhancer).

EPC1's interaction with the Ret finger protein (RFP) modulates its association with SRF. RFP competes with SRF for binding to EPC1, thereby reducing SRF-dependent transactivation and affecting muscle differentiation (Kee2011Ret).
