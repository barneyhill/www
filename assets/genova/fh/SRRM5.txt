# SRRM5

## Overview
SRRM5 (serine/arginine repetitive matrix 5) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of RNA splicing, specifically as a component of the spliceosome complex. The protein encoded by SRRM5 plays a crucial role in alternative splicing, a process that enhances proteomic diversity by allowing a single gene to produce multiple protein isoforms. This function is vital for various cellular processes, including differentiation and development, by influencing gene expression regulation within the nucleus (Rambani2016Abstract). Alterations in the SRRM5 gene have been linked to several hematological malignancies, highlighting its potential significance in disease pathogenesis and progression (Cifola2015Whole-exome; Cuenca2020Immunogenetic). Despite its recognized role in splicing, the full extent of SRRM5's impact on cellular function and its clinical implications remain areas of active research.

## Function
SRRM5 (serine/arginine repetitive matrix 5) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the RNA splicing process, a critical aspect of gene expression where introns are removed from pre-mRNA. The SRRM5 protein is a component of the spliceosome complex, which is responsible for carrying out splicing. This protein plays a significant role in alternative splicing, a process that allows a single gene to produce multiple protein isoforms, thereby contributing to the diversity of proteins within cells (Rambani2016Abstract).

In healthy human cells, SRRM5 is active in the nucleus, where it influences the regulation of gene expression. By participating in alternative splicing, SRRM5 impacts various cellular functions, including differentiation and development. The ability of SRRM5 to modulate the splicing of pre-mRNA is crucial for the proper functioning of cells, as it affects the production of proteins that are essential for numerous biological processes. The precise regulation of alternative splicing by SRRM5 ensures that cells can adapt to different functional requirements and maintain homeostasis (Rambani2016Abstract).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SRRM5 gene have been implicated in various hematological malignancies. In systemic light-chain (AL) amyloidosis, SRRM5 was identified as one of the few genes with mutations shared with multiple myeloma, suggesting a potential role in the disease's pathogenesis (Cuenca2020Immunogenetic). In primary plasma cell leukemia (pPCL), mutations in SRRM5 were found in 25% of cases, although the specific functional consequences of these mutations remain unclear (Cifola2015Whole-exome). 

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), SRRM5 is associated with mutations in the SF3B1 gene, which are linked to significant gene expression changes. This association suggests that SRRM5 may play a role in the complex genetic interactions observed in CLL, although its direct clinical significance in this context has not been fully elucidated (Lütge2021Subgroupspecific). 

Overall, while SRRM5 mutations and expression alterations are observed in several hematological conditions, the precise impact on disease progression and patient outcomes requires further investigation to establish its clinical significance.
