# OR2B6

## Overview
The OR2B6 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily B member 6, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein is involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the olfactory system by binding specific odorants and initiating a neuronal response that leads to the perception of smell. As a transmembrane receptor, OR2B6 spans the cell membrane and transduces extracellular signals through the activation of intracellular G-proteins. The olfactory receptors, including OR2B6, are characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is a hallmark of GPCRs. This gene is part of a large family of olfactory receptor genes, which are the largest gene family in the human genome, highlighting the complexity and diversity of the olfactory system (Qiu2020aarFDC).
