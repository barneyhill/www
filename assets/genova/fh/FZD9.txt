# FZD9

## Overview
FZD9, or frizzled class receptor 9, is a gene that encodes a G protein-coupled transmembrane receptor involved in the Wnt signaling pathway. The protein product of FZD9, frizzled class receptor 9, plays a critical role in various cellular processes, including the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor suppression, particularly in lung epithelial cells. It interacts with WNT7a to activate signaling pathways that promote epithelial integrity and inhibit malignant transformation (Sompel2022Loss). FZD9 is also implicated in the modulation of β-catenin signaling through its interactions with proteins such as Wnt-2 and Dishevelled-1 (Karasawa2002Frizzled9). Alterations in FZD9 expression have been associated with several cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia and lung cancer, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Sompel2022Loss; Zhang2016Methylation).

## Function
FZD9 (frizzled class receptor 9) is a G protein-coupled transmembrane receptor that plays a significant role in maintaining normal lung epithelial cells. In healthy human cells, particularly in the lung, FZD9 interacts with WNT7a to activate tumor suppressive signaling pathways. This interaction leads to the activation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARg) through an Erk5-dependent cascade, promoting anti-tumor signaling by increasing epithelial and reducing mesenchymal gene expression (Sompel2022Loss). FZD9 is crucial for maintaining epithelial integrity and preventing malignant transformation in the lung, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Sompel2022Loss).

FZD9 is also involved in the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and PPARg pathways. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, the loss of FZD9 leads to decreased PPARg activity, which is associated with increased expression of genes like IL1b, VEGFA, and COX2, supporting EMT and potentially leading to cancer development (Sompel2022Loss). FZD9 expression is influenced by miR-520a-5p, which binds to the FZD9 3'UTR and alters its activity. Cigarette smoke condensate increases miR-520a-5p expression, reducing FZD9 activity, while iloprost decreases miR-520a-5p expression, enhancing FZD9 activity (Smith2022miR520a5p).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FZD9 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In acute myeloid leukemia, the FZD9 gene is often silenced due to methylation of its promoter region, leading to a loss of gene expression in several leukemia cell lines. This silencing can be reversed with demethylating agents, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach (Zhang2016Methylation). In hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatoblastoma, FZD9 is crucial for cell proliferation and motility, and its suppression via siRNA leads to decreased expression of cyclin D1, a key regulator of the cell cycle (Tomizawa2009SiRNA).

In Myc-driven tumorigenesis, particularly in pancreatic islets, FZD9 is essential for tumor growth and cell proliferation. Its absence impairs Myc-induced β-cell dedifferentiation and tumor expansion, indicating its role in maintaining the tumorigenic potential of Myc (ZacaríasFluck2021The). In lung cancer, the loss of FZD9 expression, often due to cigarette smoke exposure, is associated with changes in epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers and increased tumor multiplicity in a urethane-induced lung cancer model. This suggests that FZD9 loss may contribute to the development of premalignant lesions and tumor progression in lung cells (Sompel2022Loss).

## Interactions
FZD9, a member of the frizzled family of receptors, is involved in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and interacts with several proteins to mediate its functions. One of the primary interactions of FZD9 is with Wnt-2, which activates FZD9 and leads to the accumulation of cytosolic β-catenin and the activation of T cell factor (TCF)-dependent transcription (Karasawa2002Frizzled9). FZD9 also interacts with Dishevelled-1 (Dvl-1), a key component in the Wnt signaling pathway. Overexpression of FZD9 results in the hyperphosphorylation and relocalization of Dvl-1 from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane, which is crucial for the downstream signaling events (Karasawa2002Frizzled9).

Additionally, FZD9 is involved in the relocalization of Axin, a negative regulator of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, to the plasma membrane in the presence of Dvl-1. This interaction suggests a role for FZD9 in modulating the localization and function of Axin, although this relocalization alone is not sufficient to activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling (Karasawa2002Frizzled9). These interactions highlight the role of FZD9 in facilitating complex signaling cascades through its interactions with various proteins.
