# PLAAT2

## Overview
PLAAT2, or phospholipase A and acyltransferase 2, is a gene that encodes a member of the phospholipase A/acyltransferase family, which plays a pivotal role in lipid metabolism. The protein encoded by PLAAT2 is involved in the biosynthesis of N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE), a precursor to bioactive N-acylethanolamines (NAEs), through its N-acyltransferase activity (Uyama2012Generation). This enzyme is characterized by its ability to transfer acyl chains from glycerophospholipids to phosphatidylethanolamine, a process that is crucial for maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis and signaling (Uyama2012Generation; Mardian2015The). PLAAT2 is expressed in various tissues, including the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys, and is implicated in regulating cell growth and differentiation, as well as potentially acting as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting RAS-mediated transformation (Shyu2007Cloning; Mardian2015The). Notably, the enzyme's activity is calcium-independent, setting it apart from other N-acyltransferases (Uyama2012Generation).

## Function
PLAAT2, also known as HRASLS2, is a member of the phospholipase A/acyltransferase family involved in lipid metabolism. It plays a crucial role in the formation of N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE) in cells, which are precursors to bioactive N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) (Uyama2012Generation). PLAAT2 exhibits N-acyltransferase activity, transferring acyl chains from the sn-1 position of glycerophospholipids to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), leading to NAPE production (Uyama2012Generation; Mardian2015The). This activity is significant for maintaining basal levels of NAPE and NAEs, which are involved in various cellular functions, including signaling and membrane dynamics (Uyama2012Generation).

PLAAT2 is expressed in several tissues, including the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys, and is involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation (Shyu2007Cloning; Mardian2015The). It has been shown to suppress RAS-mediated cellular transformation, indicating a potential role in tumor suppression (Shyu2007Cloning). The enzyme's activity is calcium-independent, distinguishing it from other N-acyltransferases (Uyama2012Generation). PLAAT2's function in healthy human cells includes influencing lipid metabolism and potentially affecting peroxisomal function, as indicated by its impact on plasmenylethanolamine levels and peroxisomal protein localization (Uyama2012Generation).
