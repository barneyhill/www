# FGFBP1

## Overview
FGFBP1, or fibroblast growth factor binding protein 1, is a gene that encodes a secreted protein involved in the regulation of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs). The FGFBP1 protein functions as an extracellular chaperone, facilitating the release and bioavailability of FGFs from the extracellular matrix, thereby enhancing their interaction with cell surface receptors. This protein plays a significant role in various physiological processes, including embryonic development, wound healing, and angiogenesis, by promoting cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation. FGFBP1 is particularly important in pathological conditions such as cancer, hypertension, and asthma, where its expression is often dysregulated, contributing to disease progression and tissue remodeling (Chen2021PolyLarginine; Tassi2011Impact; Li2022FGFBP1).

## Structure
The FGFBP1 protein, also known as fibroblast growth factor binding protein 1, consists of 234 amino acids and includes a 33-residue N-terminal signal sequence that is cleaved in the mature protein (cottarelli2015fibroblast). The protein has an apparent molecular weight of 17 kDa due to an additional cleavage site prior to Met-168 (cottarelli2015fibroblast). FGFBP1 contains five disulfide bonds formed between specific cysteine residues, which are conserved across species, contributing to the protein's stability (cottarelli2015fibroblast; Ray2014Expression).

The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including N-glycosylation at Asn155 and O-glycosylation at Ser172 (cottarelli2015fibroblast). FGFBP1 features a heparin interaction domain between residues Arg110 and Phe143, characterized by a high content of basic amino acids, and additional heparin-binding consensus sequences at Lys163-Ser169 and Lys25-His32 (cottarelli2015fibroblast). The FGF binding site is located at the C-terminal between residues Lys193 and Cys234 (cottarelli2015fibroblast; Ray2014Expression).

FGFBP1 is expressed during development in various tissues and plays a role in tumor development and angiogenesis by modulating FGF activity (cottarelli2015fibroblast; Ray2014Expression). The protein's structure allows it to enhance receptor signaling activity of FGFs without interfering with receptor access (Ray2014Expression).

## Function
FGFBP1, or fibroblast growth factor binding protein 1, plays a crucial role in modulating the activity of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) in healthy human cells. It acts as an extracellular chaperone, binding to FGFs such as FGF1, FGF2, FGF7, FGF10, and FGF22, and facilitating their release from the extracellular matrix (ECM). This process enhances the bioavailability of FGFs, allowing them to interact with their receptors and activate signaling pathways essential for various physiological processes (Rosli20141α; Tassi2011Impact).

FGFBP1 is involved in promoting cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation, which are critical during embryonic development, wound healing, and angiogenesis. By enhancing FGF signaling, FGFBP1 supports the formation of new blood vessels, a process vital for tissue repair and regeneration (Tassi2011Impact; Li2022FGFBP1). In particular, FGFBP1 expression is upregulated in response to tissue injury, accelerating wound healing by increasing fibroblast motility and angiogenesis (Tassi2011Impact).

The protein is active in the extracellular space, where it binds FGFs in a reversible, noncovalent manner, protecting them from degradation and ensuring their effective delivery to target receptors (Rosli20141α). This function is crucial for maintaining healthy tissue homeostasis and facilitating rapid responses to physiological demands.

## Clinical Significance
FGFBP1 (fibroblast growth factor binding protein 1) is implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in modulating fibroblast growth factor (FGF) activity. In hypertension, FGFBP1 is upregulated, contributing to endothelial dysfunction, a key feature of the disease. This dysfunction is linked to increased oxidative stress and vascular sensitivity to angiotensin II, which are associated with hypertension's pathogenesis (Avvisato2023miR4432).

In cancer, FGFBP1 is overexpressed in various types, including breast, bladder, colon, and pancreatic cancers. Its expression is associated with tumor growth and angiogenesis, acting as an angiogenic switch in cancer progression. In breast cancer, FGFBP1 is a direct target of Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5), promoting cell proliferation and tumor growth (Tassi2011Impact; Zheng2009Krüppellike). In bladder cancer, elevated FGFBP1 expression is linked to poor prognosis and may predict a poor response to Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) treatment (Li2022FGFBP1).

FGFBP1 is also involved in asthma, where its expression is increased in airway epithelial cells, contributing to angiogenesis and airway remodeling through the mTORC1-STAT3 pathway (Chen2021PolyLarginine). These alterations in FGFBP1 expression and function highlight its clinical significance in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
FGFBP1, also known as fibroblast growth factor binding protein 1, is involved in several key interactions with other proteins, particularly fibroblast growth factors (FGFs). FGFBP1 binds to FGF-1 and FGF-2 in a non-covalent and reversible manner, facilitating their release from the extracellular matrix (ECM) where they are bound to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) (Rosli20141α; Ray2014Expression). This interaction is crucial for the activation of FGF-2, allowing it to exert its biological effects, such as promoting angiogenesis and tumor growth (Ray2014Expression).

FGFBP1 also interacts with the HIV-1 protein Tat, which competes with FGF-2 for binding to FGFBP1. This competition suggests that Tat binding overlaps with the FGF-2/FGFBP1 interaction site or creates steric hindrance (Ray2014Expression). Despite this competition, HIV-Tat does not interfere with FGF-2 binding to its receptor FGFR1, indicating that Tat's interference is specific to the FGFBP1 interaction (Ray2014Expression).

In the context of asthma, FGFBP1 expression is upregulated via the mTORC1-STAT3 signaling pathway, where STAT3 directly binds to the promoter of the FGFBP1 gene, enhancing its expression (Chen2021PolyLarginine). This interaction highlights FGFBP1's role in promoting angiogenesis and tissue repair in airway epithelial cells (Chen2021PolyLarginine).
