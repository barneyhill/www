# RPS6KA6

## Overview
RPS6KA6 is a gene that encodes the ribosomal protein S6 kinase A6, commonly referred to as RSK4, which is a serine/threonine kinase involved in various cellular signaling pathways. This kinase is part of the ribosomal S6 kinase family and is characterized by its dual kinase domains, which play a crucial role in its function and regulation. RSK4 is primarily involved in cell cycle regulation, particularly through its interactions with the p53 pathway, and is known to mediate proliferation arrest. It is activated by the ERK1/2 pathway, a component of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, which is essential for transmitting signals from cell surface receptors to the nucleus. RSK4 is predominantly expressed in the human brain, suggesting its involvement in growth factor signaling and cellular senescence. Additionally, RPS6KA6 has been implicated in various cancers, acting as a tumor suppressor in some contexts, and is considered a potential therapeutic target due to its role in critical signaling pathways (Xu2021Prominent; Lee2007p90; LLeonart2006New).

## Structure
The RPS6KA6 gene encodes the ribosomal protein S6 kinase A6, also known as RSK4, which is a serine/threonine kinase involved in cellular signaling. RSK4 is characterized by two distinct kinase domains: an N-terminal kinase domain (NTKD) and a C-terminal kinase domain (CTKD), connected by a regulatory linker domain. The NTKD is part of the AGC kinase class, while the CTKD belongs to the calmodulin-dependent protein kinase class (Xu2021Prominent). RSK4 also features a D-type ERK1/2 docking sector necessary for ERK1/2 binding and activation, and a type 1 PDZ domain-binding motif that facilitates interaction with PDZ domain-containing proteins (Xu2021Prominent).

The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at key sites such as Ser232, Ser372, Ser389, and Thr581, which are crucial for its activation (Xu2021Prominent). RSK4 is unique among RSK isoforms due to its cytosolic nature and constitutive activity, independent of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) for activation (Xu2021Prominent). The gene also exhibits alternative splicing, leading to various protein isoforms that may have different functional properties (Sun2012Basic).

## Function
RPS6KA6, also known as ribosomal protein S6 kinase A6 or RSK4, is a member of the ribosomal S6 kinase family involved in various cellular processes. It plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation, particularly in the p53 pathway, where it mediates proliferation arrest. RPS6KA6 is implicated in p53-mediated cell cycle arrest, as its knockdown confers resistance to p19 ARF-dependent proliferation arrest and abolishes p53-dependent G1 cell cycle arrest due to ionizing radiation (Lee2007p90). This kinase is also involved in the regulation of the FGF-RAS-ERK pathway, acting as an inhibitor and disrupting the expression of Xbrachyury, a marker of mesoderm, in mouse models (Lee2007p90).

RPS6KA6 is activated by the ERK1/2 pathway, part of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, which is crucial for transmitting signals from cell surface receptors to the nucleus. This activation influences processes like cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Lee2007p90). RPS6KA6 is predominantly expressed in the human brain, with low expression in other tissues, suggesting a role in normal cellular processes related to growth factor signaling and possibly in maintaining cellular senescence (LLeonart2006New).

## Clinical Significance
The RPS6KA6 gene, also known as ribosomal protein S6 kinase A6, plays a significant role in various cancers due to its involvement in cell signaling pathways. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), RPS6KA6 acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting ERK trafficking. Its expression is significantly decreased in AML patients, which may lead to increased activity of the ERK/MAPK pathway, contributing to leukemogenesis and poor prognosis (rafiee2016down). 

In thyroid cancer, particularly papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), RPS6KA6 is down-regulated and associated with different pathological stages. It is involved in the ERK, PI3K, and p53 signaling pathways, impacting cell growth and survival (Xu2021Comprehensive). In thyroid cancer, FOXP2 regulates RPS6KA6 expression, influencing cell proliferation and apoptosis through the PI3K/AKT pathway (Yang2022FOXP2).

In colorectal cancer, RPS6KA6 is part of a synthetic lethal pair with TMC3, suggesting its role in cancer cell viability when interacting with other genetic alterations (Zhou2020Integrated). In breast cancer, RPS6KA6 expression is regulated by c-Myc and is observed in certain malignant cell lines, indicating its potential role in cancer progression (Thakur2007Aberrant).

## Interactions
RPS6KA6, also known as RSK4, is involved in several interactions that influence cellular processes. It is a component of the p53 pathway, where it mediates proliferation arrest, suggesting a role in cell cycle regulation (Lee2007p90). RPS6KA6 acts as an inhibitor of the FGF-RAS-ERK pathway by disrupting Xbrachyury expression, a molecular marker of mesoderm, which is crucial for embryonic development (Lee2007p90).

In thyroid cancer, RPS6KA6 is a transcriptional target of the transcription factor FOXP2. FOXP2 binds to the promoter of RPS6KA6, increasing its expression, which in turn regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis by inactivating the PI3K/AKT pathway (Yang2022FOXP2). This interaction highlights the role of RPS6KA6 in cancer biology and its potential as a therapeutic target.

In colorectal cancer, RPS6KA6 is involved in synthetic lethal interactions with TMC3. Knockdown of RPS6KA6 in cells with mutant TMC3 results in decreased cell viability, indicating a critical interaction that could be exploited for therapeutic purposes (Zhou2020Integrated). These interactions underscore the diverse roles of RPS6KA6 in different cellular contexts.
