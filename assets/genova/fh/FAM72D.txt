# FAM72D

## Overview
FAM72D is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 72, specifically member D. This protein is involved in critical cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and neurogenesis. FAM72D is particularly active during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, where it is regulated by the DREAM and MMB-FOXM1 complexes to ensure proper mitotic progression (Ho2021FAM72). The protein is predominantly expressed in proliferating neural stem cells within the hippocampus, playing a vital role in neural stem cell renewal and proliferation, which is essential for brain development and plasticity (Ho2021FAM72). Additionally, FAM72D has been implicated in various cancers, where its altered expression and mutations are associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Ahmed2023FAM72D; Qu2022The).

## Structure


## Function
FAM72D is a gene involved in cell cycle regulation, particularly during the G2/M phase. It is modulated by the DREAM and MMB-FOXM1 complexes, which regulate its expression to ensure proper cell cycle progression. The DREAM complex binds to the FAM72 promoter to inhibit G1/S cell cycle gene expression until it dissociates, allowing the MMB-FOXM1 complex to promote G2/M phase progression. This regulation is crucial for maintaining mitotic fidelity, as FAM72D may contribute to mitotic spindle or kinetochore-centromere complex formations. Loss of FAM72D function could lead to spindle assembly issues and mitotic catastrophe (Ho2021FAM72).

In healthy human cells, FAM72D is primarily expressed in proliferating neural stem cells (NSCs) in the hippocampus, where it plays a role in promoting NSC renewal and proliferation. This activity is essential for neurogenesis and brain plasticity, as FAM72D must be switched off to allow neuronal differentiation and brain development (Ho2021FAM72). The gene's expression is tightly regulated, and its activity is typically limited to specific tissues, such as lymphoid organs, indicating a role in tissue-specific functions (Kisselev2024Evolutionary).

## Clinical Significance
The FAM72D gene is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels and mutations. Elevated expression of FAM72D is observed in multiple tumor types, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), bladder urothelial carcinoma, breast invasive carcinoma, and others, where it is associated with advanced tumor stages and poor prognosis (Qu2022The). In HCC, FAM72D is linked to immune infiltration and tumor progression, suggesting its role as a potential therapeutic target (Qu2022The). 

In plasma cell myeloma (PCM), FAM72D expression is significantly higher in newly diagnosed or relapsed patients compared to those in remission, indicating its association with disease activity and potential as a marker for PCM relapse (Ahmed2023FAM72D). The gene's expression correlates with poor prognosis and increased risk of relapse in PCM, highlighting its role in myeloma cell proliferation (Ahmed2023FAM72D).

FAM72D mutations, including amplifications and structural variants, are present in several cancers, with a notable mutation frequency in lung adenocarcinoma. These mutations may impact disease-free survival, although they do not significantly affect overall survival (Qu2022The). The gene's involvement in immune checkpoint pathways suggests it may enhance immune checkpoint inhibitor response, further underscoring its clinical significance in cancer treatment (Qu2022The).
