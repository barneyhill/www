# KRT74

## Overview
KRT74 is a gene that encodes the protein keratin 74, a type II epithelial keratin. This protein is integral to the structural integrity of hair follicles and is primarily expressed in the inner root sheath of these follicles. Keratin 74 is involved in the formation and stabilization of keratin intermediate filaments (KIFs), which are essential for maintaining the mechanical resilience of epithelial cells, particularly in hair and nails. The protein's structure includes a central α-helical rod domain, which is crucial for its ability to form heterodimers with other keratins, facilitating the assembly of KIFs. Mutations in the KRT74 gene have been linked to hair and nail disorders, such as autosomal-dominant woolly hair and autosomal recessive pure hair and nail ectodermal dysplasia, highlighting its critical role in epithelial tissue integrity (Raykova2014Autosomal; Shimomura2010AutosomalDominant).

## Structure
Keratin 74 (KRT74) is a type II keratin protein that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity of hair follicles. The protein is characterized by a conserved structural organization, including an N-terminal head domain, a central α-helical rod domain, and a C-terminal tail domain (Shimomura2010AutosomalDominant). The central rod domain contains the helix initiation motif (HIM) and helix termination motif (HTM), which are essential for the heterodimerization process that forms keratin intermediate filaments (KIFs) (Shimomura2010AutosomalDominant).

KRT74 is primarily expressed in the inner root sheath of hair follicles, where it is involved in the formation and stabilization of hair structure (Raykova2014Autosomal). The protein can form heterodimers with other keratins, such as K28, which is consistent with its role in hair keratin intermediate filament formation (Hinbest2020Molecular). Mutations in KRT74, such as the p.Asn148Lys and p.Phe274Ser variants, have been linked to hair disorders, affecting the protein's ability to form stable intermediate filaments (Raykova2014Autosomal; Shimomura2010AutosomalDominant). These mutations can disrupt critical interactions within the protein, leading to structural instability and associated phenotypic effects.

## Function
Keratin 74 (KRT74) is a type II keratin protein that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity of hair follicles. It is specifically expressed in the inner root sheath (IRS) of hair follicles, where it contributes to the formation and maintenance of keratin intermediate filaments (KIFs) (Raykova2014Autosomal; Shimomura2010AutosomalDominant). These filaments provide mechanical support and resilience to epithelial cells, particularly in tissues subject to mechanical stress, such as hair and nails (Raykova2014Autosomal).

In healthy human cells, KRT74 forms a functional KIF network by heterodimerizing with other keratins, such as K18 and K14, which is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the cytoskeleton (Shimomura2010AutosomalDominant). This network is vital for the proper growth and texture of hair, as it ensures the stability and strength of the hair shaft (Shimomura2010AutosomalDominant).

KRT74 is also expressed in the epidermis and is involved in the formation and regeneration of nails, as evidenced by its strong expression in the nail matrix, nail bed, and hyponychium (Raykova2014Autosomal). This highlights its broader role in maintaining the structural integrity of epithelial tissues.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KRT74 gene are associated with several hair and nail disorders. One notable condition is autosomal-dominant woolly hair (ADWH), characterized by tightly curled hair. This condition results from a mutation in the KRT74 gene, specifically the c.444C > G mutation, which leads to an amino acid substitution from asparagine to lysine at position 148 (p.Asn148Lys). This mutation disrupts the keratin intermediate filament network, causing a dominant-negative effect that affects hair texture (Ramot2015The; Shimomura2010AutosomalDominant).

KRT74 mutations are also linked to autosomal recessive pure hair and nail ectodermal dysplasia (AR PHNED). A specific missense variant, c.821T.C (p.Phe274Ser), has been identified in affected individuals, leading to sparse and brittle hair and nail abnormalities. This variant interferes with keratin dimer formation, compromising the stability of intermediate filaments (Raykova2014Autosomal).

Additionally, KRT74 variants have been implicated in ectodermal dysplasia and hypotrichosis, conditions characterized by hair and nail defects (Ho2022Update). These findings underscore the critical role of KRT74 in maintaining hair and nail integrity and its involvement in various genetic disorders.

## Interactions
Keratin 74 (KRT74) is a type II epithelial keratin that plays a crucial role in the formation of keratin intermediate filaments (KIFs) within hair follicles. These filaments are essential for maintaining the structural integrity of hair and epithelial cells. KRT74 interacts with type I keratins to form heterodimers, which are necessary for the assembly of KIFs. The helix initiation motif (HIM) of KRT74 is particularly important for this heterodimerization process, as it facilitates the interaction between type I and type II keratins (Shimomura2010AutosomalDominant).

Mutations in KRT74 can disrupt these interactions, leading to conditions such as autosomal-dominant woolly hair (ADWH) and autosomal recessive pure hair and nail ectodermal dysplasia (AR PHNED). For instance, the p.Asn148Lys mutation in KRT74 affects the HIM, resulting in mislocalization and aggregation of the protein, which interferes with normal KIF formation in a dominant-negative manner (Shimomura2010AutosomalDominant). Similarly, the p.Phe274Ser variant in the coil 1B domain of KRT74 compromises the stability of intermediate filaments by potentially interfering with dimerization, leading to protein degradation and loss of function (Raykova2014Autosomal).
