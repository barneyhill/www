# GABRB1

## Overview
The GABRB1 gene encodes the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA-A) receptor subunit beta1, a critical component of the GABA-A receptor complex, which functions as a ligand-gated chloride ion channel. This receptor is pivotal in mediating inhibitory neurotransmission within the central nervous system, thereby regulating neuronal excitability and maintaining the balance between excitation and inhibition. The beta1 subunit, as part of the receptor complex, contributes to various physiological processes, including anxiety modulation, sleep regulation, and muscle relaxation. Mutations in GABRB1 have been linked to several neurodevelopmental and neurological disorders, highlighting its clinical significance. The receptor's activity is modulated by its structural configuration and interactions with other subunits, which are essential for its assembly and synaptic localization (Zhang2023Identification; Yan2020Distinct).

## Structure
The GABRB1 gene encodes the beta1 subunit of the GABA-A receptor, a ligand-gated chloride ion channel involved in inhibitory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. The primary structure of the GABRB1 protein consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain. The secondary structure includes transmembrane domains, specifically alpha helices, which are crucial for the receptor's function. The mutation c.858_859delinsTT, resulting in the amino acid change p.286_287delIleSer, affects a highly conserved region in the second helix of the β1-subunit's transmembrane region, highlighting the importance of this structural feature (Zhang2023Identification).

The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of the polypeptide, which is essential for the receptor's function, although specific details on the tertiary structure are not provided in the context. The quaternary structure of the GABA-A receptor involves the assembly of multiple subunits, including the beta1 subunit encoded by GABRB1, which interacts with other subunits to form a functional receptor complex (Anstee2013Mutations).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation are common in GABA-A receptor subunits, potentially affecting the receptor's function and regulation. Splice variants of the GABRB1 gene may result in isoforms with different functional properties, although specific variants are not detailed in the context.

## Function
The GABRB1 gene encodes the beta1 subunit of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA A) receptor, which is a ligand-gated chloride ion channel crucial for mediating inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. This receptor plays a significant role in controlling neuronal excitability by allowing chloride ions to enter neurons upon GABA binding, leading to hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal activity (Zhang2023Identification). The GABA A receptor, including the beta1 subunit encoded by GABRB1, is involved in rapid inhibitory synaptic transmission, which is essential for maintaining the balance of excitation and inhibition in the brain and spinal cord (Zhang2023Identification).

In healthy human cells, the GABRB1 subunit is part of a receptor complex that regulates various physiological processes, including anxiety, sleep, and muscle relaxation. The receptor's activity is modulated by changes in its quantity, distribution, and dynamic properties at the synapse, which are key mechanisms for regulating the intensity of inhibitory synaptic transmission and neural circuit information processing (Zhang2023Identification). The GABRB1 subunit is primarily expressed in the brain, where it contributes to the receptor's function in inhibitory neurotransmission (Yan2020Distinct).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GABRB1 gene have been associated with several neurodevelopmental and neurological disorders. Variants in this gene are linked to developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE), a condition characterized by severe epilepsy and developmental delays. Specific mutations, such as F246S and c.860C > T/p.Thr287Ile, have been identified in patients with severe epilepsy, including generalized tonic-clonic and focal seizures (Wang2024Case). A de novo variant, c.686C > T p.(Ala229Val), has also been associated with DEE, highlighting the gene's role in epilepsy (Wang2024Case).

In silico analyses have predicted that certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in GABRB1, such as D450G, P458L, and W469C, are likely damaging to the protein structure and function. These SNPs are located near conserved regions, suggesting their potential impact on neurodevelopmental disorders (Manaz2023In). The GABRB1 gene has also been implicated in conditions like bipolar disorder, autism, schizophrenia, neuropathic pain, and alcohol dependence, due to its role in fast synaptic transmission in the brain (Manaz2023In). These findings underscore the clinical significance of GABRB1 in various neurological and psychiatric conditions.

## Interactions
The GABRB1 gene encodes the beta1 subunit of the GABA-A receptor, which is involved in inhibitory neurotransmission. This subunit interacts with other GABA-A receptor subunits, such as alpha and gamma, to form functional receptor complexes essential for receptor assembly, trafficking, and synaptic localization. The interaction of nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1) with the promoter region of the GABRB1 gene is crucial for its transcriptional regulation. NRF-1 specifically binds to a conserved element in the GABRB1 promoter, as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, indicating a significant role in regulating GABRB1 expression (Li2018Nuclear).

The Polycomblike protein PHF1b also interacts with the GABRB1 promoter, particularly at the β1-INR site. PHF1b acts as a transcriptional sensor for GABA receptor activity, and its binding is influenced by GABA exposure. This interaction involves specific domains of PHF1b, including a plant homeodomain, a helix-loop-helix, and a glycine-rich motif, which are necessary for DNA association. PHF1b's interaction with the GABRB1 promoter suggests a complex regulatory mechanism involving chromatin remodeling and transcriptional modulation (Saha2013Polycomblike).
