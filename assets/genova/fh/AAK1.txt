# AAK1

## Overview
AAK1 (AP2 associated kinase 1) is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase involved in the regulation of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a fundamental cellular process for internalizing molecules. The protein product of AAK1, also referred to as AP2 associated kinase 1, plays a pivotal role in phosphorylating the μ2 subunit of the adaptor protein complex AP2, thereby enhancing its interaction with internalization motifs on membrane-bound receptors. This kinase activity is crucial for the efficient recognition and concentration of cargo during endocytosis (Conner2003AAK1‐Mediated; Conner2002Identification). AAK1 is also implicated in modulating key signaling pathways, such as the WNT and Notch pathways, by influencing receptor endocytosis and stabilization (Agajanian2019WNT; GuptaRossi2011The). Through its interactions with various proteins, including clathrin and Numb, AAK1 facilitates the dynamic processes of vesicular trafficking and signal transduction, underscoring its importance in cellular homeostasis and its potential involvement in various diseases (Sorensen2008AAK1; Conner2003AAK1‐Mediated).

## Structure


## Function
AAK1 (AP2 associated kinase 1) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a key process for internalizing molecules into cells. AAK1 phosphorylates the μ2 subunit of the adaptor protein complex AP2, enhancing its affinity for internalization motifs on membrane-bound receptors, which is essential for cargo recognition and concentration during endocytosis (Conner2003AAK1‐Mediated; Conner2002Identification). This phosphorylation is stimulated by clathrin, particularly when clathrin is assembled into cages, indicating that AAK1 activity is spatially regulated at clathrin-coated pits on the plasma membrane (Conner2003AAK1‐Mediated).

AAK1 is involved in the regulation of receptor transport, particularly in the recruitment of AP2 to receptors with tyrosine-based internalization motifs, and is crucial for the regulation of transferrin receptor recycling (Henderson2007A). It also plays a role in modulating signaling pathways, such as the WNT and Notch pathways. In the WNT pathway, AAK1 acts as a negative regulator by promoting clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the LRP6 receptor, thereby influencing cell differentiation and proliferation (Agajanian2019WNT). In the Notch pathway, AAK1 is a positive regulator, stabilizing the active form of Notch and facilitating its proper localization to endocytic vesicles (GuptaRossi2011The).

## Clinical Significance
AAK1 (AP2 associated kinase 1) has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression or interactions. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), AAK1 is mislocalized and forms aggregates with mutant SOD1 proteins, contributing to synaptic vesicle recycling dysfunction and potentially leading to presynaptic and endoplasmic reticulum dysfunction, as well as cell death. This mislocalization and aggregation are associated with the degeneration of axons and motor neurons in ALS patients (Shi2014Dysfunction). AAK1 expression is also altered in Parkinson's disease, with an intronic SNP in AAK1 linked to the age of onset, suggesting a genetic connection to the disease (Shi2014Dysfunction).

In neuropathic pain, AAK1 has been identified as a therapeutic target. AAK1 inhibitors, such as LP-935509, have shown efficacy in reducing pain responses in animal models, indicating that AAK1 plays a role in pain signal transmission. The antinociceptive effects of AAK1 inhibition are linked to interactions with the a2 adrenergic pathway (Kostich2016Inhibition). AAK1 is also involved in intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD), where it is upregulated by the lncRNA ZFAS1, promoting cell apoptosis and extracellular matrix degradation in nucleus pulposus tissues (Wang2022lncRNA).

## Interactions
AAK1 (AP2 associated kinase 1) is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. AAK1 interacts with the adaptor protein complex AP2, specifically targeting the μ2 subunit for phosphorylation, which enhances AP2's binding affinity for sorting signals on cargo proteins (Ricotta2002Phosphorylation; Conner2003AAK1‐Mediated). This interaction is facilitated by AAK1's binding to the COOH-terminal domain of α-adaptin, a component of AP2, through DPF motifs (Conner2002Identification).

AAK1 also interacts with clathrin, binding to both clathrin heavy chains (CHCs) and light chains (CLCs). These interactions are important for AAK1's kinase activity, as clathrin assembly stimulates AAK1-mediated phosphorylation of the μ2 subunit (Conner2003AAK1‐Mediated).

In addition to its interactions with AP2 and clathrin, AAK1 binds and phosphorylates the Numb protein, a critical step in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This phosphorylation affects Numb's cellular distribution, promoting its localization to the endosomal recycling compartment (Sorensen2008AAK1). AAK1 also interacts with Eps15b, a protein involved in the Notch endocytic complex, through its DPF motif (GuptaRossi2011The).
