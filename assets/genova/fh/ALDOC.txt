# ALDOC

## Overview
ALDOC, or aldolase, fructose-bisphosphate C, is a gene that encodes a glycolytic enzyme known as aldolase C. This enzyme is a key player in the glycolytic pathway, facilitating the reversible cleavage of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate, a critical step in cellular energy production. Predominantly expressed in the brain, smooth muscle, and neuronal tissues, aldolase C is categorized as a glycolytic enzyme with additional roles in cellular signaling pathways, such as the Wnt signaling pathway, where it influences cell proliferation and differentiation. Beyond its metabolic functions, aldolase C is involved in various protein interactions, suggesting moonlighting roles that extend to cellular processes like pH regulation and cancer progression. The gene's expression and regulation are clinically significant, with implications in diseases such as glioblastoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and neurological disorders (Shang2023ALDOC; Chang2018Roles; Caspi2014Aldolase).

## Structure
ALDOC, or aldolase, fructose-bisphosphate C, is a key enzyme in glycolysis, primarily expressed in the brain, smooth muscle, and neuronal tissue. The protein typically forms a homotetramer, indicating a quaternary structure, and has a molecular mass of approximately 40 kDa (Pirovich2021Multifunctional). Structurally, ALDOC contains a TIM barrel fold, a common protein fold characterized by eight alpha-helices and eight parallel beta-strands (Pirovich2021Multifunctional). 

ALDOC is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in several isoforms. Notably, variants 4a and 4b have been identified in gastric cancer cell lines. Variant 4a consists of five exons, with the first exon derived from an intronic region, while variant 4b includes an intronic region between exons 1a and 2, resulting in four exons (Hatakeyama2011Identification). These splicing variants contribute to the complexity of ALDOC's structure and function, potentially influencing its role in cancer metastasis (Hatakeyama2011Identification). 

Post-translational modifications of ALDOC may include phosphorylation, although specific details are not provided in the context. The enzyme's ability to bind to various proteins suggests it may have additional roles beyond glycolysis, known as moonlighting functions (Pirovich2021Multifunctional).

## Function
ALDOC, or aldolase C, is a glycolytic enzyme that plays a critical role in the metabolic pathway of glycolysis, where it catalyzes the reversible cleavage of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. This process is essential for energy production in cells, particularly in the brain where ALDOC is predominantly expressed (Fujita2014Detailed; Chang2018Roles).

Beyond its role in glycolysis, ALDOC is involved in several non-glycolytic functions. It interacts with the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase), a proton pump crucial for various cellular processes, including acid-base homeostasis and bone remodeling. ALDOC's interaction with V-ATPase suggests a role in the assembly, expression, and activity of this enzyme complex, potentially linking glucose metabolism with proton transport (Lu2004The; Lu2001Interaction).

ALDOC also participates in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, where it acts as an activator by interacting with the β-catenin degradation complex. This interaction enhances Wnt signaling, which is important for cell proliferation and differentiation, and may have implications in cancer progression (Caspi2014Aldolase). These diverse roles highlight ALDOC's importance in both metabolic and signaling pathways within cells.

## Clinical Significance
ALDOC (aldolase, fructose-bisphosphate C) is implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer, ALDOC expression is significantly decreased compared to non-tumor samples. This reduced expression is associated with poor prognosis and shorter overall survival in glioma patients. ALDOC acts as a potential tumor suppressor, with its expression inversely correlated with IDH1 mutation status. High ALDOC expression is linked to better survival rates and is enriched in the proneural subtype of glioblastomas (Chang2024PPARγ; Chang2019Enrichment).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ALDOC is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis, promoting cell proliferation and migration through the MYC-mediated transcription of UBE2N and regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (Shang2023ALDOC). ALDOC is also upregulated in melanoma brain metastases, where it influences the malignant phenotype of melanoma cells, particularly in the presence of microglia (Izraely2020The).

In addition to cancer, ALDOC expression is correlated with neuronal damage in conditions such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and traumatic brain injury (Chang2018Roles).

## Interactions
ALDOC, or aldolase C, is known to participate in several protein interactions that extend beyond its glycolytic function. It interacts with the E subunit of vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase), as demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid assays and precipitation assays, indicating a direct interaction. This interaction is significant in kidney tissue and osteoclasts, where aldolase C colocalizes with V-ATPase, suggesting a role in cellular processes such as pH regulation and ATP generation (Lu2001Interaction).

ALDOC also interacts with GSK-3β, a key enzyme in the Wnt signaling pathway. This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, showing that ALDOC can modulate the Wnt pathway by affecting the GSK-3β-Axin interaction. This modulation leads to changes in β-catenin levels, which are crucial for Wnt signaling (Caspi2014Aldolase).

In the context of cancer, ALDOC interacts with MUC16c in gallbladder carcinoma cells. This interaction increases ALDOC protein levels, potentially influencing glucose metabolism and promoting tumor growth (Fan2020MUC16). These interactions highlight ALDOC's diverse roles in cellular functions beyond its enzymatic activity in glycolysis.
