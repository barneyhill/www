# NCAPG2

## Overview
NCAPG2 is a gene that encodes the non-SMC condensin II complex subunit G2, a protein integral to the condensin II complex, which is essential for chromosome condensation and segregation during mitosis. This protein is characterized by its interaction with Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), facilitated by a conserved C-terminal region that undergoes phosphorylation, enhancing its binding affinity to PLK1's polo-box domain. The protein's structure includes HEAT repeat domains, which are crucial for protein-protein interactions, underscoring its role in mitotic chromosome segregation (Kim2014The; Shiheido2012An). NCAPG2's function is vital for maintaining genomic stability, and its dysregulation is implicated in various cancers, where it influences pathways related to cell proliferation and metastasis (Zhang2024NCAPG2; Meng2019NCAPG2).

## Structure
NCAPG2, a component of the condensin II complex, plays a crucial role in chromosome condensation and segregation during mitosis. The protein contains a conserved C-terminal region, which is essential for its interaction with Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1). This region includes a critical threonine residue at position 1010, whose phosphorylation enhances the binding affinity to the polo-box domain (PBD) of PLK1 (Kim2014The). The interaction between NCAPG2 and PLK1 is phosphorylation-dependent, highlighting the importance of post-translational modifications in regulating NCAPG2's function (Kim2014The).

The crystal structure of the PBD of PLK1 in complex with a phosphopeptide from NCAPG2 reveals a shallow cavity formed by antiparallel beta-sheets, which facilitates substrate binding. Key residues such as Trp414, His538, and Lys540 form hydrogen bonds with the phosphothreonine, while other residues contribute to hydrophobic contacts (Kim2014The). This structural insight underscores the evolutionary conservation of the PBD-recognition region of NCAPG2 across species, indicating its critical role in PLK1 localization to the kinetochore (Kim2014The).

NCAPG2 also contains HEAT repeat domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions, as demonstrated by its binding to the compound Q15, affecting mitotic chromosome segregation (Shiheido2012An).

## Function
NCAPG2 is a crucial component of the condensin II complex, which plays a significant role in chromosome condensation and segregation during mitosis. In healthy human cells, NCAPG2 is involved in the regulation of microtubule-kinetochore attachment, a critical process for accurate chromosome segregation. This function is achieved through the recruitment of Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) to the kinetochores during prometaphase, which is essential for proper microtubule-kinetochore interactions (Kim2014The).

The interaction between NCAPG2 and PLK1 is mediated by the polo-box domain of PLK1 and the C-terminal region of NCAPG2, with the phosphorylation of threonine 1010 on NCAPG2 being crucial for this interaction. This phosphorylation-dependent interaction ensures the localization of PLK1 at the kinetochore, which is necessary for the phosphorylation of BubR1, a key kinetochore protein involved in stabilizing microtubule attachments (Kim2014The).

NCAPG2's role in these processes is vital for maintaining genomic stability and preventing aneuploidy by ensuring proper chromosome alignment and segregation during cell division (Kim2014The). This function is conserved across species, as demonstrated in studies involving both C. elegans and human cells (Kim2014The).

## Clinical Significance
The NCAPG2 gene is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), NCAPG2 is significantly upregulated, correlating with larger tumor size, advanced TNM stage, vascular invasion, and lymph node metastasis. This overexpression is associated with worse overall and disease-free survival, promoting HCC proliferation and metastasis through the STAT3 and NF-κB/mir-188-3p pathways (Meng2019NCAPG2).

In pancreatic cancer, NCAPG2 is overexpressed and linked to poor survival outcomes, influencing pathways involved in angiogenesis, apoptosis, and tumor proliferation. Knockdown of NCAPG2 reduces cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting its role in tumor progression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Wang2023NCAPG2).

In low-grade glioma (LGG), NCAPG2 is upregulated and associated with poor clinical outcomes, including higher tumor grade and adverse therapy responses. It is identified as an independent prognostic factor, with its expression correlating with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoints (Ren2022NCAPG2).

In prostate cancer, NCAPG2 promotes malignancy and cancer stemness through the STAT3/c-MYC signaling pathway. Its expression correlates with disease progression and poor prognosis, affecting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Zhang2024NCAPG2).

## Interactions
NCAPG2, a component of the condensin II complex, is involved in several critical protein interactions that facilitate its role in chromosome segregation and cancer progression. It interacts with Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) at the kinetochore, a crucial interaction for proper microtubule-kinetochore attachment during mitosis. This interaction is mediated through the polo-box domain (PBD) of PLK1 and is dependent on the phosphorylation of threonine residue 1010 in NCAPG2 (Kim2014The). NCAPG2 is essential for the recruitment of PLK1 to kinetochores, which is necessary for the phosphorylation of BubR1, a PLK1 substrate, and for accurate chromosome segregation (Kim2014The).

In cancer biology, NCAPG2 interacts with STAT3, a transcription factor, to promote malignancy and stemness in prostate cancer. This interaction enhances the transcriptional activity of the MYC gene, a well-known oncogene, by forming a complex on the MYC promoter. The interaction between NCAPG2 and STAT3 is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, and it is crucial for the activation of c-MYC expression (Zhang2024NCAPG2). In hepatocellular carcinoma, NCAPG2 also interacts with phosphorylated STAT3, contributing to cancer progression through a positive feedback loop (Meng2019NCAPG2).
