# ZNF513

## Overview
ZNF513 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 513, a transcription factor characterized by its Cys2His2-type zinc finger domains. These domains are integral to the protein's ability to bind DNA and regulate gene expression, particularly in the retina. Zinc finger protein 513 is primarily involved in the transcriptional regulation of genes essential for the development and maintenance of photoreceptor cells, such as rods and cones, in the retina (Li2010A). The protein's function is underscored by its nuclear localization signals, which facilitate its transport into the nucleus where it exerts its regulatory roles (Li2010A). Mutations in ZNF513, such as the p.C339R mutation, have been linked to autosomal-recessive retinitis pigmentosa, a degenerative eye disease, and hereditary gingival fibromatosis, highlighting its clinical significance (Li2010A; Chen2023Double).

## Structure
ZNF513 is a zinc finger protein characterized by the presence of Cys2His2-type zinc finger binding domains, which are crucial for its function in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation (Li2010A). The protein contains three such zinc finger domains, which facilitate its role as a transcription factor in the retina (Li2010A). These domains are typically involved in recognizing specific DNA sequences, allowing ZNF513 to regulate the expression of genes critical for photoreceptor development and maintenance (Li2010A).

The primary structure of ZNF513 includes two nuclear localization signals (NLS), which are essential for its transport into the nucleus where it exerts its regulatory functions (Li2010A). The protein's expression is highest in the retina, indicating its specialized role in this tissue (Li2010A).

Mutations in ZNF513, such as the p.C339R mutation, can disrupt its ability to bind DNA, particularly affecting its interaction with the promoters of photoreceptor-specific genes (Li2010A). This mutation is predicted to alter the structure of the zinc finger domain, impacting the protein's function in transcriptional regulation (Li2010A). The conservation of the p.C339 residue across species underscores its importance in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the protein (Li2010A).

## Function
ZNF513 is a zinc finger protein that functions as a transcription factor, primarily active in the nucleus of cells. It contains zinc finger domains that enable it to bind to DNA, influencing the expression of target genes. In healthy human cells, ZNF513 plays a crucial role in the regulation of photoreceptor-specific genes, which are essential for retinal development and the maintenance of photoreceptors. It interacts with the promoters of various transcription factors and their targets, such as Pax6, Sp4, Arr3, Rhodopsin, Mop, and Sop, suggesting its involvement in the transcriptional regulation of rod and cone photoreceptors (Li2010A).

ZNF513 is expressed in several retinal layers, indicating its importance in retinal health and photoreceptor function (Li2010A). In zebrafish models, knockdown of znf513 results in significant developmental abnormalities, including reduced eye size and thinner retinal layers, highlighting its role in normal photoreceptor development (Li2010A). The protein's nuclear localization and its ability to bind to specific DNA sequences underscore its function as a nuclear transcription factor, contributing to the regulation of photoreceptor-specific gene expression and influencing the development and function of retinal cells (Li2010A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZNF513 gene have been implicated in several genetic conditions. One notable condition is autosomal-recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP), a degenerative eye disease characterized by progressive vision loss due to the degeneration of rod and cone photoreceptors. A specific mutation, p.C339R, in ZNF513 disrupts its ability to bind DNA and interact with promoters of photoreceptor genes, leading to retinal degeneration. This mutation has been identified in affected members of a Pakistani family with arRP, highlighting its pathogenicity (Li2010A).

ZNF513 is also associated with hereditary gingival fibromatosis (HGF), a rare condition characterized by fibrous overgrowth of gingival tissue. The study by Chen et al. identified double heterozygous pathogenic mutations in ZNF513 (c.C748T, p.R250W) and KIF3C as causes of HGF. These mutations lead to increased expression of ZNF513 and KIF3C, contributing to gingival fibroblast proliferation, migration, and fibrosis. The combination of these mutations activates signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK, which are implicated in the fibrotic response (Chen2023Double). These findings suggest that ZNF513 mutations play a significant role in the pathogenesis of both retinitis pigmentosa and hereditary gingival fibromatosis.

## Interactions
ZNF513 is a zinc finger DNA binding protein that plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of photoreceptor cells in the retina. It interacts with the promoters of several transcription factors and their targets, which are essential for photoreceptor development. Specifically, ZNF513 binds to the promoters of Pax6, Sp4, and their targets, including Arr3, Rhodopsin, Mop, Sop, and IER. This binding is critical for the transcriptional regulation of these genes, and a mutation in ZNF513, such as p.C339R, disrupts its ability to bind these promoters, leading to autosomal-recessive retinitis pigmentosa (Li2010A).

In the context of hereditary gingival fibromatosis, ZNF513 is identified as a transcription factor that binds to KIF3C exon 1, positively regulating its expression. This interaction was confirmed through ChIP-qPCR and electrophoresis, showing an enrichment peak of ZNF513 binding to KIF3C in gingival fibroblasts. The study also demonstrated that ZNF513 binds to the SOS1 promoter, suggesting its role in positively regulating the expression of SOS1. These interactions indicate that ZNF513 is a crucial transcription factor in the regulation of KIF3C and SOS1 expression, contributing to the pathogenesis of hereditary gingival fibromatosis (Chen2023Double).
