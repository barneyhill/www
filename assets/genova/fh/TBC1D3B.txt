# TBC1D3B

## Overview
TBC1D3B is a gene that encodes the protein TBC1 domain family member 3B, which is part of the TBC1 domain family known for its role in cellular processes such as vesicle trafficking and signal transduction. The protein is characterized by its TBC (Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16) domain, which is typically involved in the regulation of Rab GTPases, a class of proteins that control various aspects of membrane traffic. TBC1 domain family member 3B has been studied for its potential involvement in cancer biology, particularly in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), where its expression levels have been linked to tumor progression and patient prognosis (Wang2021TBC1D3).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
TBC1D3B, a member of the TBC1 domain family, has been implicated in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC). Its expression is significantly higher in KIRC tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and this overexpression is associated with poor prognosis. High levels of TBC1D3B correlate with shorter overall survival in KIRC patients, making it a potential prognostic biomarker for this type of cancer (Wang2021TBC1D3). The gene's expression is linked to immune infiltration, particularly affecting CD4+ T cells and neutrophils, and is associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, suggesting a role in modulating the immune response in cancer (Wang2021TBC1D3).

The study of TBC1D3B in KIRC also highlights its association with various clinical parameters, including tumor stage, race, gender, and age, indicating its potential involvement in the progression and aggressiveness of the disease (Wang2021TBC1D3). Despite these findings, further research is needed to confirm the clinical significance of TBC1D3B, particularly due to the lack of specific antibodies for its detection (Wang2021TBC1D3).
