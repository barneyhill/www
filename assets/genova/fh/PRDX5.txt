# PRDX5

## Overview
The PRDX5 gene encodes the protein peroxiredoxin 5, a member of the peroxiredoxin family of antioxidant enzymes. This protein is characterized by its thioredoxin fold and unique structural features, such as an additional α-helix, which distinguish it from other peroxiredoxins (Knoops2011Peroxiredoxin; Declercq2001Crystal). Peroxiredoxin 5 plays a crucial role in cellular defense against oxidative stress by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) like hydrogen peroxide and peroxynitrite, thereby maintaining cellular redox balance (Trujillo2007Presteady; Knoops2011Peroxiredoxin). The protein is ubiquitously expressed across various human tissues and is localized in multiple cellular compartments, including the cytosol, mitochondria, peroxisomes, and nucleus, allowing it to participate in diverse cellular processes (Nguyênnhu2007Human). Its involvement in cellular signaling, transcription regulation, and apoptosis underscores its importance in both normal physiology and disease states, such as cancer, where it is implicated in tumor progression and chemoresistance (Cao2020ROS‑mediated; BovariBiri2023Prdx5).

## Structure
Human peroxiredoxin 5 (PRDX5) is characterized by a thioredoxin fold, which includes a central four-stranded β-sheet flanked by three α-helices (Declercq2001Crystal; Evrard2004Crystal). This structure is typical of the peroxiredoxin family and is crucial for its antioxidant function. PRDX5 also features an additional α-helix, α5, which is unique compared to other peroxiredoxins (Knoops2011Peroxiredoxin).

The protein contains several cysteine residues, with Cys47 being the peroxidatic cysteine essential for its catalytic activity. In the oxidized form, Cys47 forms a disulfide bond with the resolving cysteine, Cys151, leading to significant structural rearrangements, including the unwinding of the α2 helix (Smeets2008The; Evrard2004Crystal). This disulfide bond formation is a key feature of its enzymatic mechanism (Smeets2008The).

PRDX5 can exist in both monomeric and dimeric forms. The dimerization involves intermolecular disulfide bonds between Cys47 of one chain and Cys151 of another, forming a covalent dimer (Evrard2004Crystal). This dimerization is distinct from the typical β-sheet associations seen in other 2-Cys peroxiredoxins (Evrard2004Crystal). The protein does not form dimers like other peroxiredoxins, which may relate to its peroxide reduction mechanism (Declercq2001Crystal). 

PRDX5 also contains a benzoate ion near the active site, which may play a role in its antioxidant activity by mimicking a peroxide substrate (Knoops2011Peroxiredoxin; Declercq2001Crystal).

## Function
Peroxiredoxin 5 (PRDX5) is a multifunctional antioxidant enzyme that plays a crucial role in protecting cells from oxidative stress by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide, organic hydroperoxides, and peroxynitrite. It is highly efficient in reducing peroxynitrite, which is attributed to the acidic nature of its thiol group and interactions with specific residues, suggesting that peroxynitrite detoxification is a key function of PRDX5 (Trujillo2007Presteady; Knoops2011Peroxiredoxin).

PRDX5 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and is localized in various cellular compartments, including the cytosol, mitochondria, peroxisomes, and the nucleus (Knoops2011Peroxiredoxin; Nguyênnhu2007Human). This broad subcellular distribution allows PRDX5 to participate in multiple cellular processes, such as signal transduction, transcription regulation, cell differentiation, proliferation, immune response, and apoptosis (Nguyênnhu2007Human).

The enzyme's antioxidant role is crucial in maintaining cellular redox balance and protecting against oxidative damage. PRDX5's ability to modulate ROS levels is essential for cellular homeostasis and organismal health, as it prevents oxidative damage and apoptosis induced by various stressors (Knoops2011Peroxiredoxin; Ji2019Peroxiredoxin5). Its overexpression has been shown to protect cells from peroxide-induced apoptosis, highlighting its cytoprotective and genoprotective effects (Trujillo2007Presteady; Nguyênnhu2007Human).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PRDX5 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In ovarian cancer, higher expression levels of PRDX5 are associated with worse overall survival, particularly within the first five years after diagnosis, suggesting its role as a negative prognostic indicator (Sienko2019Peroxiredoxin5). PRDX5 is also upregulated in other cancers, including gastric cancer, Hodgkin's lymphomas, breast cancer, endometrial cancer, and malignant mesothelioma, where it is linked to increased tumor size, depth, lymphatic invasion, and poor prognosis (Ismail2019Interplay). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), PRDX5 expression is associated with the hypomethylation of its promoter region, which correlates with tumor progression and metastasis (Cao2020ROS‑mediated).

PRDX5's role in cancer is further complicated by its involvement in chemoresistance. Its upregulation in various cancers is associated with resistance to chemotherapy and radiation, as it helps cancer cells manage increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (BovariBiri2023Prdx5). In malignant mesothelioma, PRDX5 contributes to primary drug resistance due to its antioxidant properties (Kinnula2002Overexpression). These findings suggest that targeting PRDX5 and its pathways could be a potential therapeutic strategy in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
PRDX5 interacts with various proteins and plays a significant role in cellular responses to oxidative stress. It is known to interact with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), where its redox state influences its binding and subsequent inflammatory response. The disulfide form of PRDX5 (dsPRDX5) has a higher binding propensity to TLR4 compared to other redox forms, such as the PRDX5C47S mutant, which shows a lower binding propensity (Poncin2021Role). This interaction is crucial for the activation of TLR4-mediated inflammation, as evidenced by the stimulation of IL-8 secretion (Poncin2021Role).

PRDX5 also interacts with STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) in lung cancer cells. STAT3 regulates the expression of PRDX5, with its knockdown leading to decreased PRDX5 levels, while overexpression increases PRDX5 levels. This interaction affects the migration and invasion capabilities of lung cancer cells and influences the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype (Cao2020ROS‑mediated). PRDX5 also activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, which is crucial for tumor progression, by increasing the expression of Nrf2 and NQO1 proteins (Cao2020ROS‑mediated). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of PRDX5 in cellular processes and disease mechanisms.
