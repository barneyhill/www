# CFAP20

## Overview
The CFAP20 gene encodes the cilia and flagella associated protein 20, which is a crucial component of the ciliary structure in human cells. This protein is categorized as a structural protein, playing a significant role in both motile and non-motile cilia. In motile cilia, CFAP20 is integral to the Inner Junction Hub (IJH) of ciliary double microtubules, contributing to the regulation of ciliary motility by interacting with other proteins to form a scaffold that supports the radial spokes and dynein regulatory complex (Chrystal2022The). In non-motile cilia, CFAP20 is involved in sensory functions and is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the axoneme, particularly in sensory neurons and photoreceptor cells in the retina (Chrystal2022The). Mutations in the CFAP20 gene are linked to ciliopathies, including retinal dystrophies and primary ciliary dyskinesia, highlighting its importance in ciliary function and human health (Chrystal2022The; Gonzálezdel2022A).

## Function
The CFAP20 gene encodes a protein that is integral to the structure and function of both motile and non-motile cilia in human cells. CFAP20 is a core component of the Inner Junction Hub (IJH) within ciliary double microtubules, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of the axoneme, a key element of cilia (Chrystal2022The). This protein is involved in the regulation of ciliary motility by interacting with other proteins such as PACRG, forming a scaffold that influences the radial spokes and dynein regulatory complex, which are essential for ciliary movement (Chrystal2022The).

In non-motile cilia, CFAP20 is implicated in sensory functions and is essential for the structural integrity of the axoneme inner junction, particularly in sensory neurons (Chrystal2022The). The protein's role in non-motile cilia is linked to signaling functions, which are crucial for various physiological processes (Chrystal2022The). CFAP20 is also critical for vision, as it is involved in maintaining the function and structural integrity of photoreceptor outer segments, which are specialized cilia in the retina (Chrystal2022The). Disruption of CFAP20 can lead to retinal dystrophy, highlighting its importance in retinal health (Chrystal2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CFAP20 gene are associated with several ciliopathies, including inherited retinal dystrophies such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP). These mutations can lead to progressive photoreceptor degeneration, resulting in visual deficits that typically manifest between adolescence and adulthood (Chrystal2022The; Gonzálezdel2022A). In zebrafish models, loss of CFAP20 function results in retinal disorganization and impaired photoreceptor function, which is indicative of a ciliary photoreceptor degeneration phenotype (Chrystal2022The).

CFAP20 mutations have also been linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a motile ciliopathy that affects respiratory function, fertility, and organ positioning (Chrystal2022The). In humans, biallelic CFAP20 variants have been identified in patients with retinal dystrophy, and these mutations often lead to reduced protein stability and functionality, affecting the structural integrity of the ciliary axoneme (Chrystal2022The).

The gene's role in both motile and non-motile cilia suggests that CFAP20-related diseases might present as either non-syndromic conditions affecting a single organ system or as pleiotropic disorders impacting multiple systems (Chrystal2022The). The presence of CFAP20 in various species underscores its importance in maintaining ciliary function and photoreceptor health (Chrystal2022The).

## Interactions
CFAP20 is involved in the structural integrity and function of cilia, interacting with several proteins to form and maintain the inner junction of ciliary doublet microtubules. It forms a repeating unit with PACRG, contributing to the structural integrity of the inner junction, which acts as a scaffold for the radial spoke and dynein regulatory complex machinery crucial for ciliary movement (Chrystal2022The). CFAP20 interacts with PACRG, and these interactions are essential for maintaining the microtubule inner junction, which is vital for ciliary function (Chrystal2022The). The localization of CFAP20 and PACRG to the inner junction is independent of each other, suggesting that their interaction may not be direct or necessary for localization (Chrystal2022The).

CFAP20 also interacts with other proteins such as CFAP52, CFAP45, CFAP90, CFAP126, and EFHC1, which are positioned to potentially form a scaffold or influence the radial spokes and dynein regulatory complex (Chrystal2022The). These interactions are crucial for the stability and assembly of the doublet microtubule inner junction, indicating CFAP20's role in both motile and non-motile cilia (Chrystal2022The).
