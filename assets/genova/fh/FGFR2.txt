# FGFR2

## Overview
FGFR2, or fibroblast growth factor receptor 2, is a gene that encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase protein involved in critical cellular processes such as growth, differentiation, and survival. The FGFR2 protein is a transmembrane receptor that interacts with fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) to initiate a cascade of downstream signaling pathways, including the MAPK and PI3K pathways, which are essential for cellular proliferation and differentiation (Moffa2006Differential; Katoh1992Cancer). The receptor's structure includes immunoglobulin-like domains that facilitate ligand binding and specificity, and it undergoes dimerization upon activation (Goetz2013Exploring; Belov2013Molecular). FGFR2 is expressed in various isoforms, such as FGFR2b and FGFR2c, which are generated through alternative splicing and exhibit distinct tissue-specific roles (Katoh1992Cancer; Yeh2003Structural). Mutations and alterations in FGFR2 are implicated in several congenital disorders and cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Katoh2009FGFR2; Su2014FGFR2).

## Structure
FGFR2 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 2) is a receptor tyrosine kinase with a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of FGFR2 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein. Its secondary structure includes immunoglobulin-like domains (D1, D2, and D3), which are crucial for ligand binding and specificity (Belov2013Molecular). The D1 and D2 domains adopt Ig folds belonging to the I set of the Ig superfamily, while D3 has an unusual Ig-fold with a highly mobile bC'-bE loop (Belov2013Molecular).

The tertiary structure of FGFR2 involves a three-dimensional conformation that includes a single transmembrane helix and a cytoplasmic portion with protein tyrosine kinase activity (Yeh2003Structural). The quaternary structure is characterized by dimerization upon ligand binding, which is essential for its activation (Goetz2013Exploring).

FGFR2 undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which is crucial for its kinase activity (Belov2013Molecular). Alternative splicing of FGFR2 mRNA, particularly involving exons IIIb ('b') and IIIc ('c'), generates isoforms with different ligand-binding profiles, such as FGFR2b and FGFR2c (Goetz2013Exploring; Yeh2003Structural). These isoforms exhibit distinct functional properties and are involved in specific signaling pathways.

## Function
FGFR2 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 2) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in regulating cell growth, differentiation, and survival through its interaction with fibroblast growth factors (FGFs). Upon binding to its ligands, FGFR2 undergoes dimerization and autophosphorylation, which activates downstream signaling pathways such as the MAPK and PI3K pathways. These pathways are essential for cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival (Moffa2006Differential; Katoh1992Cancer).

FGFR2 exists in different isoforms, including FGFR2b and FGFR2c, which are produced through alternative splicing. FGFR2b is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues and is involved in processes like wound healing and mucosal repair, while FGFR2c is expressed in mesenchymal cells (Katoh1992Cancer). FGFR2b signaling is particularly important during embryogenesis, where it facilitates epithelial migration and morphogenesis in various organs (Katoh1992Cancer).

In the nervous system, FGFR2 is involved in synapse formation through FGF22-FGFR2b signaling (Katoh1992Cancer). The receptor's activity is primarily located in the cell membrane, where it interacts with other signaling molecules to maintain cellular homeostasis and function (Moffa2006Differential).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FGFR2 gene are linked to a variety of diseases and conditions. FGFR2 mutations are associated with several congenital skeletal disorders, including Crouzon syndrome, Jackson-Weiss syndrome, Apert syndrome, Pfeiffer syndrome, Beare-Stevenson syndrome, and Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. These disorders often involve craniosynostosis and other skeletal abnormalities (Park1995Novel; Katoh2009FGFR2). In cancer, FGFR2 mutations and gene amplifications are implicated in breast, gastric, endometrial, and lung cancers. In breast cancer, FGFR2 gene amplification is linked to overexpression and constitutive activation of FGFR2 signaling, particularly in estrogen receptor-positive cases (Katoh2009FGFR2; Katoh2009FGFR2related). FGFR2 amplification in gastric cancer is associated with poor prognosis and lymph node metastases (Su2014FGFR2).

FGFR2 fusions and rearrangements are also significant in cancer, with FGFR2 fusion-positive cholangiocarcinoma showing resistance to FGFR inhibitors due to secondary mutations (Goyal2017Polyclonal). In melanoma, FGFR2 mutations affect ligand specificity and kinase activity (Katoh2009FGFR2). FGFR2 is also involved in non-cancerous conditions like atopic dermatitis, where specific SNPs have been identified (Katoh2009FGFR2).

## Interactions
FGFR2 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular signaling pathways. One significant interaction is with the adaptor protein Grb2, which binds to FGFR2 through its C-terminal SH3 domain. This interaction is essential for regulating protein tyrosine phosphatases, particularly Shp2, within the FGFR2 signaling complex. The binding of Grb2 to FGFR2 helps maintain receptor phosphorylation, which is vital for downstream signaling, including MAPK activation (Ahmed2010Direct).

FGFR2 also forms a transient complex with ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2) in breast cancer cells, particularly after stimulation with FGF2. This interaction is indirect and depends on the activation of both FGFR2 and RSK2. The FGFR2/RSK2 complex is implicated in breast cancer progression and prognosis, with co-expression associated with aggressive cancer subtypes (Czaplinska2016Interactions).

Additionally, FGFR2 interacts with human FGF1 through its D2 domain. This interaction is crucial for receptor dimerization and subsequent signaling. Suramin, an antiparasitic drug, can block this interaction, inhibiting FGF-induced angiogenesis and potentially exhibiting antitumor activity (Wu2016Suramin).
