# CPXM2

## Overview
CPXM2 is a gene that encodes the protein carboxypeptidase X, M14 family member 2, which is part of the carboxypeptidase family but is considered inactive due to its lack of typical enzymatic function. This protein is categorized as a non-enzymatic member of the carboxypeptidase family and is implicated in various biological processes, including extracellular matrix remodeling and cell signaling. CPXM2 is expressed in multiple tissues, such as the brain and heart, and is thought to play roles in heart development, cell adhesion, and response to mechanical stimuli. Despite its unclear molecular function, CPXM2's involvement in cardiac tissue remodeling and potential role in inner ear development highlight its significance in both normal physiology and disease contexts (Grabowski2021Cpxm2; Lyons2024Inactive).

## Function
The CPXM2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the carboxypeptidase family, although it lacks the typical enzymatic function associated with carboxypeptidases. Its specific function in healthy human cells is not fully understood, but it is implicated in extracellular matrix functions and possibly in inner ear development (Lyons2024Inactive). CPXM2 contains a discoidin domain, which is associated with cellular adhesion, migration, and aggregation, suggesting a role in cell signaling and extracellular matrix remodeling (Grabowski2021Cpxm2). The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the brain and heart, and is thought to be involved in processes like heart development, cell adhesion, and response to mechanical stimuli (Grabowski2021Cpxm2).

In cardiomyocytes, CPXM2 is localized at t-tubules, indicating a potential role in maintaining t-tubule structure or calcium handling, although this requires further investigation (Grabowski2021Cpxm2). The gene's expression is associated with cardiac function and failure, and it may interact with enzymes involved in posttranslational modifications, affecting protein localization and function (Grabowski2021Cpxm2). Despite its unclear molecular function, CPXM2's involvement in cardiac tissue remodeling makes it a candidate for further study in the context of heart disease (Grabowski2021Cpxm2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CPXM2 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In the context of inner ear development, mutations in CPXM2 have been associated with developmental issues, as observed in the headbobber mouse model, which exhibited symptoms such as headbobbing, circling, and deafness (Lyons2024Inactive). In humans, similar mutations have been implicated in inner ear development disorders (Lyons2024Inactive).

CPXM2 has also been associated with multiple sclerosis, where an intronic polymorphism is linked to more aggressive forms of the disease (GilVarea2018Exome). In cancer, CPXM2 overexpression has been observed in various types, including gastric, hepatic, and osteosarcoma, where it is associated with poor prognosis and increased tumor aggressiveness (Niu2019Overexpression; Ye2020&lt; Expression; Zhao2019Overexpression; p&gt). In hepatocellular carcinoma, CPXM2 promotes malignancy through the gp130/JAK2/STAT1 signaling pathway (Expression; p&gt; Ye2020&lt).

In cardiac conditions, CPXM2 is implicated in left ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis, with increased expression linked to cardiac remodeling and failure in hypertensive models (Grabowski2021Cpxm2). Knockout studies in mice suggest a protective effect against cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, indicating CPXM2's significant role in these conditions (Subrova2022MiRNA29b).
