# UPK3B

## Overview
Uroplakin 3B (UPK3B) is a gene that encodes the protein uroplakin 3B, a member of the tetraspanin superfamily, which is integral to the structure and function of epithelial tissues. The UPK3B protein is characterized by a single transmembrane domain, a glycosylated N-terminal luminal domain, and a substantial cytoplasmic domain, which collectively contribute to its role in forming apical asymmetrical unit membrane (AUM) plaques. These plaques are essential for maintaining the structural integrity and impermeability of the urothelium, particularly in the bladder, by stabilizing epithelial cells exposed to mechanical stress (Lennartz2022Analysis; Rudat2014Upk3b). Although UPK3B is primarily associated with the urinary tract, it is also expressed in various other tissues, including neural crest cells, heart, liver, kidneys, lungs, and reproductive organs, indicating its potential involvement in diverse biological processes (Kuriyama2016Spatiotemporal). The protein's expression in different tissues and its role in forming heterodimeric complexes with other uroplakins underscore its importance in cellular architecture and function (Rudat2014Upk3b).

## Structure
The UPK3B protein is an integral membrane protein belonging to the tetraspanin superfamily, characterized by a single transmembrane domain, a glycosylated N-terminal luminal domain, and a relatively large cytoplasmic domain (Rudat2014Upk3b). These structural features suggest a role in anchoring urothelial plaques to the cytoskeleton. UPK3B forms heterodimeric complexes with UPK1B in the endoplasmic reticulum, which then assemble into tetramers and concentric hexameric rings, integrating into the cell surface membrane to form apical asymmetrical unit membrane (AUM) plaques (Lennartz2022Analysis). These plaques are crucial for stabilizing epithelial cells exposed to physical extension, such as those in the bladder.

The protein's cytoplasmic domain may interact with the cytoskeleton, helping maintain the apical-basal polarity of mesothelial tissues (Rudat2014Upk3b). UPK3B is expressed in various tissues, including neural crest cells, heart, liver, kidneys, lungs, and genital organs, but not in the bladder (Kuriyama2016Spatiotemporal). The protein is also expressed in testicular and epididymal sperm and ovarian follicles, suggesting a role in gamete maturation (Kuriyama2016Spatiotemporal).

## Function
UPK3B (uroplakin 3B) is a protein primarily expressed in the urothelium, the tissue lining the urinary tract, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and impermeability of the bladder epithelium. It is involved in forming the asymmetric unit membrane, which is essential for the urothelial barrier function, preventing urine leakage and protecting underlying tissues from toxic substances (Lennartz2022Analysis; Rudat2014Upk3b).

UPK3B is expressed in normal mesothelial cells, umbrella cells, and amnion cells, suggesting its role as a stabilizer of cell layers that undergo periodic distension (Lennartz2022Analysis). The protein's luminal N-glycosylation may help lubricate mesothelial surfaces by binding extracellular fluids, while its cytoplasmic domain interacts with the cytoskeleton to maintain the apical-basal polarity of mesothelial tissues (Rudat2014Upk3b).

In addition to its role in the urinary tract, UPK3B is expressed in various tissues, including the mucosal epithelium of the fallopian tubes, and is implicated in the maturation of gametes and gamete-delivery organs (Kuriyama2016Spatiotemporal). This broad expression pattern suggests that UPK3B may have diverse roles in different tissues, contributing to their structural and functional integrity.

## Clinical Significance
UPK3B (uroplakin 3B) has been identified as a potential diagnostic marker for certain cancers, particularly mesothelioma and urothelial tumors. Its expression is notably high in epithelioid and biphasic mesotheliomas, as well as various subtypes of urothelial tumors, making it useful for distinguishing these cancers from other thoracic tumors and adenocarcinomas (Lennartz2022Analysis). In urothelial tumors, UPK3B expression decreases with increasing tumor grade, from 61.9% in low-grade tumors to 14.6% in muscle-invasive carcinomas, although this expression level is not linked to patient prognosis (Lennartz2022Analysis).

Despite its diagnostic potential, UPK3B is not highly specific to mesothelial cells, as it is also expressed in retinal pigment epithelial cells and urothelial cells, which may limit its specificity as a diagnostic marker for mesothelioma (KanamoriKatayama2011LRRN4). Studies have shown that UPK3B is dispensable for the development and integrity of urothelium and mesothelium, suggesting that its absence does not lead to significant developmental defects in these tissues (Rudat2014Upk3b). There is no direct evidence linking UPK3B mutations or expression alterations to specific diseases or conditions, but its role in cancer diagnosis is significant.

## Interactions
UPK3B, a member of the uroplakin family, is known to form heterodimeric complexes with other uroplakins. Specifically, UPK3B can interact with UPK1B, while UPK1A is known to heterodimerize with UPK2. These interactions are crucial for the structural integrity and function of the urothelial barrier, contributing to the efficient sealing of luminal spaces (Rudat2014Upk3b). 

Despite these known interactions, the functional analysis of UPK3B in the urothelium has not been extensively performed, and the study by Rudat et al. did not find evidence for the formation of 'mesothelial plaques' similar to urothelial plaques, suggesting that UPK3B's role might differ in mesothelial tissues (Rudat2014Upk3b). 

The research by Kanamori-Katayama et al. also highlights UPK3B as a marker associated with the mesothelial lineage, but it does not provide specific information about protein interactions involving UPK3B in mesothelial cells (KanamoriKatayama2011LRRN4). Similarly, the study by Kuriyama et al. focuses on the expression patterns of UPK3B but does not detail specific protein interactions (Kuriyama2016Spatiotemporal). Overall, while UPK3B is involved in forming complexes with other uroplakins, detailed interaction studies are limited.
