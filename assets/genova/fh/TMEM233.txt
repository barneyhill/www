# TMEM233

## Overview
TMEM233 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 233, a member of the dispanin family, specifically the DSPB subfamily. This protein is characterized by its transmembrane topology, featuring an intracellular N-terminal domain and an extracellular C-terminal domain. TMEM233 is primarily expressed in nociceptors, a type of sensory neuron involved in pain perception, where it plays a critical role in modulating the function of the NaV1.7 sodium channel. The interaction between TMEM233 and NaV1.7 is essential for regulating sodium currents and neuronal excitability, which are pivotal in pain signaling pathways. TMEM233's involvement in these pathways is further underscored by its interaction with pain-causing venom peptides, such as ExTxA, which affect NaV1.7 channel gating and contribute to prolonged pain responses (Jami2023Paincausing).

## Structure
TMEM233 is a protein characterized by a single transmembrane topology, with an intracellular N-terminal domain and an extracellular C-terminal domain (Jami2023Paincausing). It is a member of the dispanin gene family, specifically the DSPB subfamily, which is known for having two transmembrane helices. The first helix is highly conserved and contains an alanine residue and a double cysteine motif, while the second helix often includes a conserved glycine residue (Sällman2012The). 

TMEM233 is rich in glycosylation and phosphorylation sites, predominantly located on the N-terminus, which is longer than the C-terminus and oriented outside the cell (Sällman2012The). The protein does not function as an ion channel but is part of a NaV signaling complex in sensory neurons, interacting with NaV1.7 channels (Jami2023Paincausing). 

The N-terminal domain of TMEM233 plays a crucial role in its interaction with NaV1.7, affecting the channel's inactivation properties. A synthetic peptide corresponding to the TMEM233 N-terminus can replicate the effects of the full-length protein on NaV1.7, highlighting the importance of this region (Jami2023Paincausing).

## Function
TMEM233 is a transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in modulating the function of the NaV1.7 sodium channel, which is significant in pain signaling pathways. It is specifically expressed in nociceptors, a subtype of neurons in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), where it modulates sodium currents involved in pain perception (Jami2023Paincausing). TMEM233 interacts with NaV1.7, influencing the channel's gating properties and recovery from inactivation, which are critical for neuronal excitability and action potential propagation (Jami2023Paincausing).

The protein is part of the dispanin family and is characterized by an extracellular C-terminus and an intracellular N-terminus, which may facilitate its interaction with NaV1.7 and other proteins like PRRT2 and TRARG1 (Jami2023Paincausing). TMEM233's role in modulating NaV1.7 is further highlighted by its interaction with pain-causing venom peptides, such as ExTxA from stinging nettles, which inhibit the inactivation of NaV1.7, leading to persistent currents and prolonged pain responses (Jami2023Paincausing). This interaction suggests that TMEM233 may cause allosteric changes in channel gating, impacting pain perception at the organismal level (Jami2023Paincausing).

## Interactions
TMEM233 interacts with the sodium channel NaV1.7, playing a crucial role in modulating its function. This interaction is particularly significant in the context of the effects of the toxin ExTxA, which requires TMEM233 for the inhibition of NaV1.7 inactivation. TMEM233 is shown to enhance the potency of ExTxA when co-expressed with NaV1.7, suggesting a direct interaction between these proteins (Jami2023Paincausing). The proximity ligation assay (PLA) and co-purification experiments have demonstrated that TMEM233 can form a complex with NaV1.7, indicating a stable interaction (Jami2023Paincausing).

TMEM233 is a member of the dispanin family and shares structural similarities with its paralogs PRRT2 and TRARG1, which are involved in neurological diseases. These proteins have larger N-terminal domains and are associated with the modulation of sodium channels (Jami2023Paincausing). The interaction between TMEM233 and NaV1.7 is hypothesized to be mediated by the intracellular N-terminal domain of TMEM233, as evidenced by experiments showing that an N-terminally truncated TMEM233 mutant does not affect NaV1.7 recovery from fast inactivation (Jami2023Paincausing). This interaction is crucial for understanding the modulation of NaV1.7 function and its implications in pain signaling pathways.
