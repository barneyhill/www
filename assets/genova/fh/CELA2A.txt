# CELA2A

## Overview
CELA2A is a gene that encodes the protein chymotrypsin-like elastase 2A, a serine protease enzyme involved in various physiological processes. This enzyme plays a critical role in the regulation of plasma insulin levels and platelet activation, contributing to glucose-dependent insulin secretion and degradation. It is predominantly expressed in the pancreas, with additional expression in the adrenal gland and small intestine, indicating its involvement in insulin regulation and digestive health. Chymotrypsin-like elastase 2A also participates in the maintenance of the extracellular matrix by degrading elastin, which is essential for tissue remodeling and repair. The protein's interactions with other molecules, such as alpha-1-antitrypsin and insulin, underscore its significance in metabolic pathways and cardiovascular health (Esteghamat2019CELA2A).

## Function
The CELA2A gene encodes a protein known as chymotrypsin-like elastase 2A, which functions as a serine protease enzyme. In healthy human cells, CELA2A is primarily involved in the regulation of plasma insulin and platelet activation. It plays a significant role in glucose-dependent insulin secretion and degradation, with a strong correlation between plasma CELA2A and insulin levels, suggesting an insulinotropic effect (Esteghamat2019CELA2A). CELA2A is also involved in reducing platelet aggregation by proteolytically degrading the GPIIb/IIIa receptor complex, which is crucial for platelet activation (Esteghamat2019CELA2A).

The protein is predominantly expressed in the pancreas, with notable presence in the adrenal gland and small intestine. It is detected in the exocrine pancreas and pancreatic islets, indicating its role in insulin regulation (Esteghamat2019CELA2A). CELA2A also contributes to the maintenance of the extracellular matrix by breaking down elastin, a key component of tissue remodeling and repair (Esteghamat2019CELA2A). The enzyme's activity is crucial for various physiological processes, including nutrient absorption and overall digestive health, as it is secreted by the pancreas and active in the extracellular space (Esteghamat2019CELA2A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CELA2A gene are associated with early-onset coronary artery disease (CAD) and metabolic syndrome. These mutations often lead to conditions such as hypertriglyceridemia (HTG), hypertension (HTN), and type 2 diabetes (T2D), contributing to a high cardiovascular risk profile (Esteghamat2019CELA2A). The p.D121N mutation, in particular, is linked to severe hyperinsulinemia in non-diabetic carriers and affects insulin secretion and degradation, leading to elevated insulin levels (Esteghamat2019CELA2A). This mutation also impairs the function of CELA2A in reducing platelet aggregation, which may increase the risk of thrombosis (Esteghamat2019CELA2A).

CELA2A mutations disrupt the elastase activity of the protein, affecting its interaction with alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT) and other substrates, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and metabolic syndrome (Esteghamat2019CELA2A). The gene's role in insulin signaling and platelet activation suggests that alterations in CELA2A expression or function could be significant in the development of these conditions (Esteghamat2019CELA2A). The study of CELA2A mutations highlights their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for related metabolic and cardiovascular diseases (Esteghamat2019CELA2A).

## Interactions
The CELA2A protein, or chymotrypsin-like elastase 2A, engages in several significant interactions with other proteins, influencing various physiological processes. One notable interaction is with alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT), where the wild-type CELA2A forms a complex with A1AT, as indicated by a 75-kDa band in Western blot analysis. This interaction is disrupted in certain mutant forms of CELA2A, such as p.D121N and p.T70M, which do not form complexes with A1AT, except for a small complex formed by the p.L85M mutant (Esteghamat2019CELA2A).

CELA2A also interacts with insulin and platelet-related proteins. The wild-type CELA2A enhances insulin signaling activity and degrades insulin, whereas the p.D121N mutant does not, indicating a loss of function in insulin degradation. This interaction affects insulin levels and signaling pathways (Esteghamat2019CELA2A). Additionally, CELA2A interacts with platelet proteins, specifically integrin A2B, a component of the GPIIb/IIIa receptor complex involved in platelet aggregation. The wild-type CELA2A reduces platelet aggregation and activation by cleaving the ITGA2B component, while the p.D121N mutant promotes hyperactivation and aggregation of platelets (Esteghamat2019CELA2A). These interactions highlight CELA2A's role in modulating insulin degradation and platelet activation.
