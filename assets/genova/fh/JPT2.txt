# JPT2

## Overview
JPT2, or Jupiter microtubule-associated homolog 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in critical cellular processes, particularly calcium signaling. The protein encoded by JPT2 is categorized as a microtubule-associated protein and plays a pivotal role in NAADP-evoked calcium signaling by acting as an accessory protein for two-pore channels (TPCs), especially TPC1. This interaction facilitates the release of calcium ions from acidic organelles, which is essential for various cellular functions, including endolysosomal trafficking and T cell activation (Gunaratne2021Essential). JPT2 is expressed in a wide range of human tissues, with significant expression in the brain and spinal cord, and is implicated in processes such as viral infection and tumorigenesis (Gunaratne2021Essential; Marchant2022NAADPbinding). Its involvement in these pathways underscores its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in cancer and viral infections (Gunaratne2021Essential; Gunaratne2021Jupiter).

## Function
The JPT2 gene encodes the Jupiter microtubule-associated homolog 2 protein, which plays a critical role in NAADP-evoked calcium (Ca2+) signaling in human cells. JPT2 functions as an accessory protein for two-pore channels (TPCs), particularly TPC1, facilitating the release of Ca2+ from acidic organelles in response to NAADP, a second messenger involved in various cellular processes (Gunaratne2021Essential). This protein is essential for the NAADP receptor complex, enabling TPC-dependent Ca2+ signaling and regulating endolysosomal trafficking events (Gunaratne2021Essential).

JPT2 is broadly expressed in human tissues and cell lines, with notable expression in the brain, particularly the spinal cord (Marchant2022NAADPbinding). It is involved in the generation of localized Ca2+ microdomains during T cell activation, crucial for activating the ryanodine receptor isoform 1 (RyR1) in the endoplasmic reticulum (Gunaratne2021Essential). The protein is localized to the cell surface, cytoplasm, and nucleus, indicating its involvement in diverse cellular functions (Gunaratne2021Essential).

JPT2 also plays a role in viral infection processes, such as supporting the endolysosomal translocation of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, highlighting its potential as a target for antiviral therapeutics (Gunaratne2021Essential). Its involvement in cell growth and tumorigenesis suggests broader implications for its function in cellular physiology (Gunaratne2021Essential).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the JPT2 gene, also known as HN1L, have been implicated in the progression of various cancers, including breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma. Elevated levels of JPT2 mRNA are observed in many tumor types, correlating with increased cancer cell invasiveness, metastasis, and poorer survival outcomes. In non-small cell lung cancer, overexpression of JPT2 is associated with larger tumor size and poor prognosis, while knockdown of JPT2 inhibits cell proliferation, migration, and tumor growth (Gunaratne2021Essential; Marchant2022NAADPbinding).

In breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer, high JPT2 expression is linked to low survival rates. The gene is involved in the self-renewal of cancer stem cells, contributing to treatment resistance and metastasis. Silencing JPT2 reduces breast cancer stem cells and improves chemotherapy sensitivity (ERTURK2023Evaluation).

JPT2 also plays a role in viral infections, such as SARS-CoV-2, by facilitating viral entry through the endolysosomal system. Knockdown of JPT2 significantly reduces the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for viral infections (Gunaratne2021Essential; Gunaratne2021Jupiter).

## Interactions
JPT2, also known as Jupiter microtubule-associated homolog 2, is a protein that plays a significant role in NAADP-evoked calcium signaling by interacting with various proteins. JPT2 is identified as a NAADP-binding protein that associates with two-pore channels (TPCs), specifically TPC1 and TPC2, which are located on endosomes and lysosomes. This interaction is crucial for mediating calcium release from acidic stores (Gunaratne2023Convergent). JPT2 shows a stronger interaction with TPC1 compared to TPC2, indicating a preference that may influence the regionalization of NAADP action (Gunaratne2023Convergent; Marchant2022NAADPbinding).

JPT2 also interacts with ryanodine receptors (RyR1) in T lymphocytes, suggesting its role in conferring NAADP sensitivity to multiple intracellular calcium channels (Gil2023T; Marchant2022NAADPbinding). This interaction is supported by co-localization studies and coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Gil2023T). Additionally, JPT2 is involved in endolysosomal trafficking processes, which are essential for the translocation of viral particles, such as the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, through the endolysosomal system (Gunaratne2023Convergent; Gunaratne2021Essential). These interactions highlight JPT2's critical role in cellular signaling pathways and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.
