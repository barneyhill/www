# CDK17

## Overview
Cyclin-dependent kinase 17 (CDK17) is a gene that encodes the protein cyclin-dependent kinase 17, a member of the PCTAIRE family of kinases. This protein is predominantly expressed in the brain, indicating its potential specialized role in neuronal functions (Endicott2013Structural). As a kinase, CDK17 is involved in various cellular processes, including the modulation of exocytosis and neurotransmitter release, through its interactions with protein transport complexes in the early secretory pathway (Endicott2013Structural). Despite the lack of identified specific substrates, CDK17's ability to phosphorylate proteins such as histone H1 and myelin basic protein in vitro suggests its involvement in chromatin modification and myelin sheath maintenance (Endicott2013Structural). The evolutionary conservation of CDK17 across higher eukaryotes underscores its potential importance in neuronal development and function, although its precise cellular roles remain to be fully elucidated. Additionally, CDK17 has been implicated in cancer biology, acting as a hub gene in glioblastoma and potentially playing dual roles as a tumor suppressor or oncoprotein in different cancer types (Karimbayli2024Insights).

## Function
CDK17, also known as PCTAIRE-2, is a cyclin-dependent kinase primarily expressed in the brain, suggesting a specialized role in neuronal function (Endicott2013Structural). It is part of the PCTAIRE kinase family, which includes CDK16 and CDK18, and is characterized by unique structural features such as long N-terminal extensions and small C-terminal domains (Endicott2013Structural). CDK17 is involved in modulating exocytosis and transmitter release in neuronal cells, as it interacts with protein transport complexes in the early secretory pathway (Endicott2013Structural).

Although specific substrates for CDK17 have not been identified, PCTAIRE kinases, including CDK17, can phosphorylate histone H1 or myelin basic protein in vitro, indicating potential roles in chromatin modification and myelin sheath maintenance (Endicott2013Structural). The evolutionary conservation of PCTAIRE genes in higher eukaryotes, such as mice and Drosophila, suggests a conserved function across species, although no orthologues are found in yeast genomes (Endicott2013Structural). The precise cellular and organismal outcomes of CDK17's activity remain to be fully elucidated, but its expression pattern and interactions imply a significant role in neuronal development and function.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
CDK17, a member of the PCTAIRE family of kinases, is involved in various protein-protein interactions. It interacts with TRAP and Cables1, although these interactions do not stimulate its kinase activity in vitro (Karimbayli2024Insights). CDK17 is also capable of forming a stable ternary complex with the estrogen receptor alpha (ERa) and 14-3-3b proteins in a phosphorylation-independent manner. This interaction was demonstrated through yeast two-hybrid screens and co-immunoprecipitation assays, indicating that CDK17 can bind to 14-3-3b (Jehle2022A). 

CDK17's interactions extend to its potential role in modulating the interaction of ERa with 14-3-3 proteins, as shown in a phospho-Y2H matrix approach. This study suggested that kinase-inactive versions of CDK17 could still bind to 14-3-3 proteins, supporting its role in stable complex formation rather than direct phosphorylation (Jehle2022A). 

In the context of cancer, CDK17 is identified as a hub gene in glioblastoma, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role, while in other cancers, it may act as an oncoprotein. Its expression correlates with genes involved in transcription, cell adhesion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, such as NEDD1, PPP1R2A, MED13L, ELK3, and QKI (Karimbayli2024Insights).
