# NAA11

## Overview
NAA11 is a gene that encodes the protein N-alpha-acetyltransferase 11, NatA catalytic subunit, which is a component of the NatA complex involved in the N-terminal acetylation of nascent polypeptides. This protein modification is prevalent in eukaryotic cells and plays a critical role in regulating protein stability, localization, and interactions, thereby influencing various cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and apoptosis (Starheim2009Composition; Pang2011Expression). The NAA11 gene exhibits tissue-specific expression, predominantly in the testis and placenta, with its protein product, hNaa11p, detected mainly in the testis (Pang2011Expression). The expression of NAA11 is regulated by DNA methylation, particularly at CpG islands in its promoter region, which affects its expression in different tissues and has implications in diseases such as cancer (Pang2011Expression).

## Function
The NAA11 gene encodes a subunit of the NatA complex, which is involved in the N-terminal acetylation of nascent polypeptides, a common protein modification process in eukaryotic cells. This modification is crucial for normal cellular functions, affecting protein stability, localization, and interactions (Starheim2009Composition; Pang2011Expression). NAA11 is expressed in a tissue-specific manner, predominantly in the testis and placenta, with the protein product hNaa11p detected only in the testis (Pang2011Expression).

The NatA complex, which includes NAA11, plays a significant role in regulating cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Silencing components of the NatA complex, like hNaa10p or hNaa15p, leads to reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis, highlighting its importance in promoting cell proliferation (Pang2011Expression). NAA11's expression is regulated by DNA methylation, particularly at CpG islands in its promoter region, which influences its tissue-specific expression (Pang2011Expression).

In the context of cellular biology, NAA11 is active in the cytoplasm and is associated with ribosomes, where it participates in the co-translational acetylation of proteins, a process essential for maintaining cell survival and proliferation (Arnesen2006Induction).

## Clinical Significance
The NAA11 gene, also known as ARD1B, is implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer, due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. NAA11 is expressed in a tissue-specific manner, primarily in the testis and placenta, and its expression is regulated by DNA methylation. In many cancer tissues, NAA11 expression is absent or significantly reduced, correlating with hypermethylation of its promoter region. This suggests that DNA methylation plays a role in suppressing NAA11 expression in cancerous tissues (Pang2011Expression).

The absence of NAA11 expression in cancer cells, despite less extensive methylation in some cases, indicates that other regulatory mechanisms might also be involved (Pang2011Expression). The loss of heterozygosity in NAA11 has been associated with poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma patients, suggesting a potential clinical significance in cancer prognosis (Pang2011Expression).

The re-expression of NAA11 in some cancer specimens may result from a loss of DNA methylation, leading to the reactivation of gene transcription. This re-expression can be mimicked by treating non-expressing cells with a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, highlighting the potential for therapeutic interventions targeting epigenetic regulation (Pang2011Expression).
