# SRPK1

## Overview
SRPK1 (SRSF protein kinase 1) is a gene that encodes a serine/arginine protein kinase, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of mRNA splicing and processing. The protein product of SRPK1 is involved in the phosphorylation of serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins, which are crucial for the proper assembly and function of the spliceosome, a complex responsible for the removal of introns from pre-mRNA. This kinase is characterized by its unique bipartite structure, which includes two conserved kinase domains separated by a spacer sequence, and it exhibits a strong preference for phosphorylating serines followed by arginine (Colwill1996SRPK1; Zhong2009Regulation). SRPK1 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences various cellular processes, including mRNA stability, translation, and cellular stress responses (Mole2020Human). Beyond its fundamental role in mRNA processing, SRPK1 is implicated in several pathological conditions, particularly cancer, where its dysregulation is associated with tumor progression and resistance to therapy (Duggan2022SerineArginine; van2015Tumor).

## Structure
SRPK1 (SRSF protein kinase 1) is characterized by a bipartite structure, featuring two conserved kinase domains separated by a unique spacer sequence. This spacer is similar to those found in receptor tyrosine kinases and plays a role in signal transduction, although its removal does not significantly impact kinase activity. However, it does alter the cellular distribution of SRPK1 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (Zhong2009Regulation).

The primary structure of SRPK1 includes serine/arginine-rich (SR) dipeptide repeats, which are the primary targets for phosphorylation. SRPK1 shows a strong preference for phosphorylating serines followed by arginine, a specificity that distinguishes it from other kinases like Clk/Sty, which can also target serines followed by proline (Colwill1996SRPK1).

Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, are crucial for SRPK1's function, influencing its activity and interactions with other proteins. These modifications are essential for its role in regulating SR protein phosphorylation and alternative splicing (Zhong2009Regulation).

SRPK1 also exists in several splice variant isoforms, contributing to its functional diversity and allowing it to participate in various cellular processes (Zhong2009Regulation).

## Function
SRPK1 (SRSF protein kinase 1) is a serine/arginine protein kinase that plays a critical role in the phosphorylation and splicing of SR proteins, which are essential for mRNA processing in healthy human cells. This kinase is involved in the import of SR proteins into the nucleus following phosphorylation, regulating their functions through cycles of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation (Mole2020Human). SRPK1 is active in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments, where it influences various cellular processes, including mRNA stability and translation (Mole2020Human).

In the nucleus, SRPK1 phosphorylates the splicing factor SRSF1, facilitating its nuclear localization and assembly into nuclear speckles, which is crucial for its splicing activity (Gonçalves2014Phosphorylation). This phosphorylation is necessary for the inclusion of specific exons during mRNA splicing, impacting gene expression and cellular responses (Gonçalves2014Phosphorylation). SRPK1 also interacts with nuclear Clk1 to promote splicing and can relocate to the nucleus in response to cell stress, epidermal growth factor (EGF), and Akt signaling (Mole2020Human).

SRPK1's role extends to metabolic signaling and innate immunity, highlighting its multifunctional nature in cellular biology (Mole2020Human). Its activity is crucial for normal cellular functions, including cell cycle progression and stress responses, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Mole2020Human).

## Clinical Significance
SRPK1 (SRSF protein kinase 1) plays a significant role in cancer progression and is associated with various malignancies. Overexpression of SRPK1 is commonly observed in epithelial cancers, such as breast, prostate, colorectal, and lung cancers, and is linked to advanced disease stages and poor survival outcomes (Duggan2022SerineArginine; Nikas2019SerineArginine). In breast cancer, high SRPK1 expression is correlated with metastasis, particularly to the lungs and brain, and is associated with poor metastasis-free survival (van2015Tumor). SRPK1 influences cancer cell migration and metastasis through the NF-κB signaling pathway and affects focal adhesion dynamics (van2015Tumor).

In non-small-cell lung cancer, SRPK1 overexpression contributes to resistance against EGFR-TKI therapy by enhancing EGFR expression and activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, leading to poor progression-free survival (Huang2023Serinearginine). In extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, increased SRPK1 expression is linked to poor prognosis and cisplatin resistance, with SRPK1 inhibitors showing potential in restoring chemotherapy sensitivity (He2022Inhibition). SRPK1's role in cancer is complex and context-dependent, with its expression and interactions varying significantly across different tumor types and microenvironments (Duggan2022SerineArginine).

## Interactions
SRPK1 (SRSF protein kinase 1) is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, primarily related to its role in mRNA splicing. SRPK1 phosphorylates SR proteins, such as SRSF1, by targeting their RS domains, which is essential for their nuclear transport and splicing function (Aubol2014Recruiting). It forms a complex with CLK1 in the nucleus, where it acts as a release factor, facilitating the dissociation of phosphorylated SRSF1 from CLK1. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing (Aubol2016Release).

SRPK1 also interacts with the RS domain of SRSF1, initiating phosphorylation at the C-terminal edge and threading the domain through its docking groove in a C-to-N-terminal direction. This process is influenced by the structural changes in SRSF1, which affect the phosphorylation kinetics and ADP exchange rate (Aubol2011Applying). Additionally, SRPK1's interaction with CLK1 is symbiotic, with SRPK1 enhancing SR protein phosphorylation in the cytoplasm and CLK1 in the nucleus. This dual-kinase system is essential for the full phosphorylation of SR proteins, which are involved in spliceosome assembly (Aubol2016Release).
