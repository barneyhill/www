# TLR9

## Overview
TLR9 is a gene that encodes the protein toll-like receptor 9, a transmembrane receptor that plays a pivotal role in the innate immune system. This receptor is primarily involved in the recognition of unmethylated CpG motifs, which are prevalent in bacterial and viral DNA, thereby facilitating the detection of pathogenic microorganisms. TLR9 is initially localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and requires trafficking to endosomal compartments to become functionally active. Upon activation, TLR9 initiates signaling cascades that lead to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I interferons, crucial for mounting an effective immune response. The receptor's structure is characterized by leucine-rich repeat motifs, which are essential for its ligand-binding and signaling functions. TLR9's activity is tightly regulated to prevent inappropriate immune responses, and its dysregulation is implicated in various diseases, including autoimmune disorders and cancer (Marongiu2019Below; Vollmer2006TLR9; Luo2020TLR9).

## Structure
TLR9 is a protein involved in the immune response, characterized by its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs that form a solenoid structure with parallel beta-sheets (Onji2013An). The primary structure of TLR9 includes a sequence of amino acids that form these LRR motifs, which are crucial for its function. The secondary structure consists of alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to the protein's overall horseshoe shape (Asami2021Structural).

The tertiary structure of TLR9 is defined by its horseshoe-shaped ectodomain, which is typical of LRR proteins. This structure is stabilized by the N-terminal and C-terminal LRR motifs, known as LRR-NT and LRR-CT, respectively (Asami2021Structural). TLR9 also contains a unique Z-loop insertion that requires proteolytic processing for receptor maturation (Asami2021Structural).

In terms of quaternary structure, TLR9 can exist in monomeric or dimeric forms. Dimerization is induced by binding to agonistic DNA, forming an m-shaped 2:2 complex (Ohto2015Structural). This dimerization is essential for TLR9's function in DNA recognition and signaling (Ohto2015Structural).

Post-translational modifications of TLR9 include glycosylation, which occurs on the insertion-free faces of the protein and is nonfunctional for ligand binding (Wei2009Homology). The cleaved form of TLR9, which is about 80 kDa, is the active form that recruits MyD88 upon activation (Ewald2008The).

## Function
TLR9 (Toll-like receptor 9) is a crucial component of the immune system, primarily involved in recognizing unmethylated CpG motifs found in bacterial and viral DNA. In healthy human cells, TLR9 is initially localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and requires trafficking to endosomal compartments to initiate signal transduction. This localization is essential to prevent inappropriate immune responses to self-DNA, which is typically methylated and non-stimulatory (Marongiu2019Below; Vollmer2006TLR9).

Upon activation by CpG DNA, TLR9 undergoes a conformational change, leading to the recruitment of adaptor molecules such as MyD88. This initiates signaling cascades involving IRAK family members and TRAF6, resulting in the activation of NF-κB and MAPK pathways, which promote the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I interferons (Marongiu2019Below; Vollmer2006TLR9). In plasmacytoid dendritic cells, TLR9 engagement is particularly important for the production of type I interferons, crucial for antiviral responses (Marongiu2019Below).

The trafficking and signaling of TLR9 are tightly regulated by proteins such as UNC93B1, which facilitates its movement from the ER to endosomes, and BAD-LAMP, which directs TLR9 to late endosomes, promoting cytokine production (Marongiu2019Below). This complex regulation ensures that TLR9 effectively contributes to the immune response while avoiding self-reactivity.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the TLR9 gene have significant clinical implications in various diseases. In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), TLR9 plays a complex role. Although TLR9 mRNA levels are elevated in SLE patients and correlate with disease severity, its dysfunction in B cells contributes to the progression of SLE by promoting the production of autoreactive antibodies. This dysfunction is linked to decreased differentiation into regulatory B cells, which are crucial for immunomodulation (Wen2023Tolllike). TLR9-deficient mice develop more severe clinical disorders, suggesting a protective role of TLR9 in lupus that is independent of MyD88 signaling (Wen2023Tolllike).

In the context of cancer, TLR9 expression is upregulated during the development of colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC), where it regulates the NF-κB signaling pathway, contributing to cancer progression (Luo2020TLR9). TLR9 dysregulation is also implicated in neonatal inflammatory diseases, where excessive signaling leads to fatal conditions driven by IFN-γ (Stanbery2020Dysregulation).

TLR9 deficiency is associated with osteoclastic bone loss due to systemic chronic inflammation, highlighting its role in maintaining bone health and regulating inflammation. This deficiency alters gut microbiota composition, contributing to inflammatory conditions (Ding2022Tolllike).

## Interactions
TLR9 interacts with unmethylated CpG-DNA, a common feature of bacterial DNA, in a sequence- and pH-dependent manner. This interaction occurs primarily in endosomal and lysosomal compartments, where the acidic environment facilitates binding. The DNA-binding region within TLR9 is homologous to the methyl-CpG-binding domain found in other proteins, and specific amino acids, such as D535 and Y537, are crucial for CpG-DNA binding and subsequent NF-kB activation (Rutz2004Toll‐like).

TLR9 also forms complexes with the adaptor protein MyD88, which is essential for initiating downstream signaling pathways. This interaction leads to the recruitment of other signaling molecules, including members of the IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) family and TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), resulting in the activation of transcription factors like NF-kB and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Vollmer2006TLR9).

The trafficking of TLR9 to endolysosomes is mediated by interactions with proteins such as UNC93B1, which facilitates its movement from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi and then to the plasma membrane. This process is crucial for TLR9 to encounter its ligands and initiate immune responses (Marongiu2019Below).
