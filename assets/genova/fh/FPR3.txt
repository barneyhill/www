# FPR3

## Overview
FPR3, or formyl peptide receptor 3, is a gene that encodes a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in the immune system's response to formylated peptides, which are signaling molecules originating from bacterial and mitochondrial sources. The receptor, characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices, is primarily expressed in immune cells such as monocytes and dendritic cells, where it plays a crucial role in chemotaxis and immune cell activation. FPR3's ability to bind specific ligands, such as the endogenous peptide F2L, facilitates intracellular signaling pathways that are essential for immune surveillance and the coordination of innate and adaptive immune responses (Ye2009International). The gene's involvement in various diseases, including cancer and Alzheimer's disease, highlights its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions (Rovelet-Lecrux2011A; Qi2021Identification).

## Structure
FPR3 (formyl peptide receptor 3) is a G protein-coupled receptor characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices, a hallmark of GPCRs. The primary structure of FPR3 consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its function in the immune response. The secondary structure includes these transmembrane alpha-helices, which are crucial for the receptor's ability to span the cell membrane and facilitate signal transduction.

The tertiary structure of FPR3 involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, allowing it to interact with ligands and other cellular components effectively. This folding is essential for the receptor's functional conformation and its ability to engage in signaling pathways. While the quaternary structure typically refers to the assembly of multiple protein subunits, there is no specific information provided about FPR3 forming such complexes.

Post-translational modifications of FPR3, such as phosphorylation and glycosylation, play significant roles in modulating its function and signaling capabilities. These modifications can influence receptor activity, stability, and interactions with other proteins, thereby impacting the immune response mediated by FPR3. The presence of these modifications highlights the complexity and regulatory potential of FPR3 in cellular processes.

## Function
FPR3, or formyl peptide receptor 3, is a G protein-coupled receptor involved in the immune response by recognizing and binding to formylated peptides, which are signaling molecules derived from bacterial and mitochondrial sources. This receptor is primarily expressed in monocytes and dendritic cells, where it plays a significant role in chemotaxis, guiding these immune cells to sites of infection or inflammation (Ye2009International).

FPR3 interacts with specific ligands, such as the endogenous peptide F2L, which is derived from the cleavage of the heme-binding protein. F2L acts as a potent agonist for FPR3, leading to intracellular calcium release and activation of signaling pathways like ERK 1/2 MAPKs, which are crucial for immune cell activation and migration (Ye2009International). FPR3 also responds to the mitochondrial peptide fMMYALF, although with lower affinity (Ye2009International).

The receptor is involved in linking innate and adaptive immune responses by acting as a chemoattractant for monocyte-derived dendritic cells, which are essential for antigen presentation and the initiation of adaptive immunity (Ye2009International). FPR3's role in immune cell chemotaxis and response to formylated peptides underscores its importance in maintaining immune surveillance and response to pathogens.

## Clinical Significance
FPR3 (formyl peptide receptor 3) is implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in immune response regulation. In breast cancer, FPR3 is highly expressed and associated with poor prognosis. Its expression correlates with the activation of cancer-related pathways, such as 'pathways in cancer' and 'cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction', suggesting that FPR3 may promote tumorigenesis through G-protein coupled receptor pathways. This makes FPR3 a potential target for novel intervention strategies in breast cancer treatment, especially given the limited efficacy of current immune checkpoint therapies (Qi2021Identification).

In Alzheimer's disease, a duplication involving the FPR3 gene was identified in a patient with early-onset Alzheimer's, suggesting a potential link to the disease's pathogenesis, particularly in early-onset cases (Rovelet-Lecrux2011A). However, the specific role of FPR3 in Alzheimer's disease mechanisms remains unclear.

FPR3 is also involved in inflammatory responses, as it can be activated by peptides associated with amyloidogenic diseases. This activation can influence immune cell migration and response, potentially impacting conditions characterized by chronic inflammation and autoimmune diseases (Ye2009International).
