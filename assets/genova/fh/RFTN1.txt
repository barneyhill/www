# RFTN1

## Overview
RFTN1, or raftlin, lipid raft linker 1, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the structure and function of lipid rafts within cellular membranes. The protein, also referred to as Raftlin1, is categorized as a lipid raft protein and plays a pivotal role in immune signaling by modulating both B-cell and T-cell receptor pathways. It is particularly significant in the immune system, where it influences processes such as cell adhesion and signal transduction. Raftlin1 is involved in the regulation of Th17 cell pathogenicity through its interaction with the transcription factor RORγt, which is crucial for immune response modulation and inflammation. The gene's expression and function have been linked to various clinical conditions, including autoimmune diseases, inflammatory bowel diseases, and certain cancers, highlighting its importance in both normal immune function and disease pathogenesis (Xin2024Investigating; Singh2023RORγtRaftlin1; Chen2012Interactive).

## Function
RFTN1, also known as raftlin lipid raft linker 1, is a protein that plays a crucial role in the organization and integrity of lipid rafts, which are specialized microdomains within the cell membrane. These lipid rafts are essential for various cellular processes, including signal transduction and immune responses. RFTN1 is particularly involved in B-cell receptor signaling, where it contributes to the modulation of immune system functions (Chen2012Interactive).

In T cells, RFTN1 is implicated in the modulation of T-cell receptor signaling, which is vital for the immune response. It enhances Th17-mediated autoimmune responses, indicating its role in immune regulation (Chen2012Interactive). The protein is active in the plasma membrane, where it influences processes such as cell adhesion and signal transduction, impacting the overall immune system function (Chen2012Interactive).

RFTN1 also interacts with the transcription factor RORγt, forming a complex that regulates the pathogenicity of Th17 cells. This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of specific lipid ligands that drive the pathogenicity of Th17 cells, highlighting its role in immune response modulation and inflammation (Singh2023RORγtRaftlin1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the RFTN1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease, RFTN1 expression is upregulated, correlating with increased levels of IL-17A in CD4+ T cells. This upregulation is associated with enhanced pathogenicity of Th17 cells, contributing to mucosal inflammation and tissue damage in UC patients (Singh2023RORγtRaftlin1). The RORγt-Raftlin1 complex, involving RFTN1, is crucial for the pathogenicity of Th17 cells, and its disruption can reduce colonic inflammation and autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) severity (Singh2023RORγtRaftlin1).

In breast cancer, RFTN1 expression levels influence the tumor microenvironment. Higher RFTN1 expression is linked to increased anti-tumor immunity, characterized by enhanced activation and recruitment of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, potentially improving prognosis in certain breast cancer subtypes (Xin2024Investigating). Conversely, lower RFTN1 expression is associated with reduced immune cell interactions, suggesting a role in immune escape mechanisms (Xin2024Investigating).

RFTN1 has also been associated with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), where specific sequence variations in the gene may interact with other genetic factors to increase disease risk (Chen2012Interactive). These findings highlight the diverse clinical significance of RFTN1 in immune regulation and disease pathogenesis.

## Interactions
RFTN1, also known as Raftlin1, is a lipid raft protein that plays a significant role in immune signaling by interacting with various proteins. It specifically interacts with the transcription factor RORγt, forming a complex that is crucial for the pathogenicity of Th17 cells. This interaction is mediated through the LLNSL motif of Raftlin1, which binds to the AF2 domain of RORγt. The RORγt-Raftlin1 complex is essential for recruiting specific lipid ligands that enhance the pathogenic function of Th17 cells, particularly in response to bacterial pathogens like Citrobacter rodentium (Singh2023RORγtRaftlin1).

Raftlin1 also translocates to the nucleus and colocalizes with RORγt in CD4+ T cells, where it binds to the IL-17 promoter, promoting IL-17 expression. This interaction is significant in the context of colonic inflammation and diseases such as ulcerative colitis (Singh2023RORγtRaftlin1). Disruption of the Raftlin1-RORγt interaction, as seen in Raftlin1 ΔLLNSL mice, results in reduced pathogenic Th17 cell activity and decreased expression of inflammatory markers (Singh2023RORγtRaftlin1). These findings suggest that Raftlin1's interactions with RORγt and other proteins are pivotal in modulating immune responses and inflammation.
