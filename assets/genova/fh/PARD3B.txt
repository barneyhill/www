# PARD3B

## Overview
PARD3B is a gene that encodes the par-3 family cell polarity regulator beta, a protein integral to the regulation of cell polarity and adhesion, particularly in epithelial cells. As a member of the Par-3 family, this protein functions as a scaffold, playing a pivotal role in organizing the cell cytoskeleton and influencing various intracellular signaling pathways, such as the Hippo-KIBRA/Yap and PI3K/AKT pathways (Yang2022Contribution). PARD3B is primarily localized at adherens junctions and lateral membranes, where it interacts with proteins like E-cadherin to maintain cell adhesion and communication (Thompson2021Par‐3). Unlike its homolog PARD3, which is more apically localized, PARD3B's distinct positioning underscores its specialized function in maintaining epithelial cell polarity and tissue organization (Thompson2021Par‐3). The protein's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in cellular organization and its potential implications in various pathological conditions, including cancer.

## Function
PARD3B, a member of the Par-3 family of proteins, plays a crucial role in establishing and maintaining cell polarity and adhesion in epithelial cells. It is typically localized at adherens junctions, where it contributes to the clustering of E-cadherin and signaling via Src family kinases, which are important for cell adhesion and communication (Thompson2021Par‐3). In stratified squamous epithelia, PARD3B is strongly expressed in basal layer stem cells, indicating its role in maintaining stem cell characteristics and possibly influencing mitotic spindle orientation in response to mechanical forces (Thompson2021Par‐3).

PARD3B functions as a scaffold protein, shaping the cell cytoskeleton and morphology, and is involved in various intracellular signaling pathways, including the Hippo-KIBRA/Yap, PI3K/AKT, and TIAM-mediated Rac1 pathways (Yang2022Contribution). These pathways are critical for regulating cell proliferation, migration, and survival, highlighting PARD3B's role in maintaining cellular organization and function. The protein's localization to lateral membranes in epithelial cells, where it associates with E-cadherin, suggests a specialized function distinct from its homolog PARD3, which is more apically localized (Thompson2021Par‐3). This distinct localization pattern underscores PARD3B's role in maintaining epithelial cell polarity and tissue organization.

## Clinical Significance
The PARD3B gene plays a significant role in the development and progression of various cancers. In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), PARD3B is implicated in tumorigenesis and malignance through its interaction with the androgen receptor (AR) signaling axis. Testosterone exposure increases PARD3B expression, promoting cell proliferation and colony formation in glioblastoma cells. This effect can be inhibited by reducing AR activation, suggesting that targeting AR signaling could be a potential therapeutic strategy for GBM (Yang2022Contribution).

Alterations in PARD3B expression are also observed in other cancer types. In normal human brain tissues, PARD3B mRNA levels are low, but they are significantly upregulated in GBM tissues. Similar upregulation is noted in cancers such as cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and stomach adenocarcinoma. Conversely, PARD3B expression is downregulated in several other cancers, including breast invasive carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma, indicating a complex role in cancer biology (Yang2022Contribution).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of PARD3B in cancer, where its dysregulation can contribute to tumor progression and metastasis, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
PARD3B, a member of the Par-3 family, is involved in cell polarity regulation and interacts with several proteins. It is identified as a component of the apical PAR6B/PALS1 polarity complex, although it does not physically bind to PAR6B in conventional co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Instead, proximity-based assays like BioID and immunostaining suggest that PARD3B is proximal to PAR6B, indicating a potential interaction that may not be stable under certain conditions (Wang2021A). 

In polarized Caco-2 cells, PARD3B was found in proximity to PAR6B, especially in three-dimensional cultures, suggesting a possible isoform switch between PARD3 and PARD3B in different culture conditions. Despite this proximity, co-immunoprecipitation did not show a stable association between PARD3B and the Par complex (Wang2021A). 

PARD3B is also noted for its localization at tight junctions with the tight junction protein ZO-1, although its interaction with aPKC is not observed, and its association with PAR6B remains controversial (Wang2021A). These interactions highlight PARD3B's role in regulating lumen formation and maintaining epithelial cell polarity.
