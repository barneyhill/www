# CLSTN3

## Overview
The CLSTN3 gene encodes the protein calsyntenin-3, a postsynaptic adhesion molecule that plays a pivotal role in synapse development and function. Calsyntenin-3 is primarily involved in the formation and maintenance of synaptic connections, particularly in the hippocampus and cerebellum, where it influences the balance between excitatory and inhibitory synapses. It achieves this by interacting with presynaptic neurexins, specifically the SS4-positive β-neurexin variants, through its cadherin domains, which are essential for its synaptogenic activity (Kim2020Calsyntenin3; Lu2014Calsyntenin3). Beyond its synaptic roles, CLSTN3 is implicated in the regulation of energy and bone homeostasis and is associated with several neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and psychiatric conditions such as PTSD and depression (Mori2022Loss; Kim2020Neural). The gene's expression and function underscore its importance in maintaining synaptic balance and its potential impact on neurological health.

## Function
Calsyntenin-3 (CLSTN3) is a synaptic adhesion molecule that plays a crucial role in synapse development, particularly in the hippocampus. It interacts directly with presynaptic neurexins, specifically the SS4-positive β-neurexin variants, to induce presynaptic differentiation. This interaction is mediated by the cadherin domains of CLSTN3, which are necessary for its synaptogenic activity (Kim2020Calsyntenin3). CLSTN3 is predominantly expressed postsynaptically and is involved in the development of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. It localizes to the postsynaptic membrane and triggers presynaptic differentiation by forming trans-synaptic complexes with neurexin 1α, a presynaptic organizer (Lu2014Calsyntenin3).

In the cerebellum, CLSTN3 functions as a postsynaptic adhesion molecule, influencing the balance between excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Its deletion results in a decrease in inhibitory synapses and an increase in excitatory parallel-fiber synapses, suggesting a role in regulating synaptic balance (Liu2022Deletion). CLSTN3's interaction with neurexins is distinct from other neurexin partners, as it does not strictly require the sixth LNS domain of neurexin 1α (Lu2014Calsyntenin3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CLSTN3 gene have been implicated in several neurological disorders. CLSTN3 is associated with synaptic adhesion and intracellular transport, and its dysfunction can lead to significant behavioral and physiological changes. In studies involving mice, the deletion of CLSTN3 has been linked to reduced body mass and altered energy homeostasis, which may have implications for conditions like obesity (Kim2020Neural). Additionally, CLSTN3 is found in the cerebrospinal fluid of Alzheimer's disease patients, suggesting a potential link to this neurodegenerative disorder (Kim2020Neural).

The loss of CLSTN3, along with other calsyntenin paralogs, has been shown to disrupt interneuron stability and lead to behavioral abnormalities such as increased stress sensitivity and decreased motivation, which are features observed in psychiatric disorders like PTSD and depression (Mori2022Loss). Furthermore, the deletion of CLSTN3 in the cerebellum results in an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory synapses, which could contribute to neurological conditions related to synaptic imbalances (Liu2022Deletion). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CLSTN3 in maintaining synaptic balance and its potential role in various neurological and psychiatric conditions.

## Interactions
Calsyntenin-3 (CLSTN3) is a postsynaptic adhesion molecule that interacts with presynaptic neurexins (Nrxns) to facilitate excitatory synapse development in the hippocampus. It directly binds to β-neurexins through their LNS domain and its own cadherin domains, with a preference for splice site 4 (SS4) insert-positive β-Nrxn variants. This interaction is crucial for synaptogenic activity, as the presence of these variants can reverse impaired synaptogenic activity in Nrxn-deficient neurons (Kim2020Calsyntenin3). CLSTN3 does not interact with α-Nrxns, and its cadherin domains are essential for binding to β-Nrxns (Kim2020Calsyntenin3).

In addition to its role in synapse development, CLSTN3 is involved in the regulation of energy and bone homeostasis. It is expressed postsynaptically in various brain regions and is required for presynapse differentiation through its interaction with α-neurexin (Kim2020Neural). CLSTN3 is also coexpressed and potentially coregulated with AMPA receptor genes, suggesting a role in synaptic plasticity (Chong2007Promoter).
