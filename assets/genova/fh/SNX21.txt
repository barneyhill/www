# SNX21

## Overview
SNX21 is a gene that encodes the protein sorting nexin family member 21, which is part of the sorting nexin family involved in intracellular trafficking processes. The protein is characterized by the presence of a Phox-homology (PX) domain, which facilitates its binding to phosphoinositides and association with endosomal membranes, and a unique C-terminal PXB domain containing tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs that may mediate protein-protein interactions (Teasdale2011Insights; Qi2024The). SNX21 is implicated in endosomal sorting and trafficking, particularly in the regulation of the endo-lysosomal sorting of activated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and is associated with early endosomes and pathogen-containing vacuoles during infection (Qi2024The). Despite its structural features, the specific cargos or binding partners of SNX21 remain to be fully elucidated, and its precise role in endocytic pathways continues to be an area of active research (Qi2024The).

## Structure
SNX21 is a protein characterized by the presence of a Phox-homology (PX) domain, which is crucial for its binding to phosphoinositides, particularly phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P), facilitating its association with endosomal membranes (Qi2024The). The PX domain is followed by a PXB domain, which contains three tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs). These TPR motifs are α-α-hairpin structures that form helical solenoids, contributing to the protein's ability to engage in protein-protein interactions (Teasdale2011Insights; Qi2024The).

The structure of SNX21's PXB domain is composed of three TPR helical repeats, with each TPR motif consisting of an inner and an outer helix forming a concave structure. This configuration is typical of TPR-containing domains, which often serve as scaffolds in various cellular processes (Qi2024The). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to include six α-helices downstream of the PX domain, forming a folded domain of unknown function (Teasdale2011Insights).

SNX21's PX domain is not exclusively specific to PtdIns(3)P, as it may also bind to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2), suggesting a versatile role in membrane targeting (Qi2024The). The detailed structure and interactions of SNX21 remain to be fully elucidated, and its specific cargos or binding partners have not yet been identified (Qi2024The).

## Function
SNX21 is a member of the sorting nexin family, which is involved in intracellular trafficking processes. It contains a Phox-homology (PX) domain that binds to phosphoinositides, facilitating its association with cellular membranes, particularly endosomes. SNX21 is implicated in endosomal sorting and trafficking, playing a role in the regulation of the endo-lysosomal sorting of activated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which suggests its involvement in cargo transport within cells (Qi2024The).

SNX21 is highly expressed in infant liver samples, with expression levels decreasing during development. It is also expressed in various tissues, including the dorsal root ganglia, skeletal muscle, and brown adipose tissue in mice (Qi2024The). The protein is associated with early endosomes and is recruited to newly formed Salmonella-containing vacuoles during infection, indicating a potential role in macropinocytosis and endosomal trafficking (Qi2024The).

SNX21 contains a unique C-terminal PXB domain composed of TPR helical repeats, which may facilitate protein-protein interactions, potentially acting as a scaffold during endocytosis (Qi2024The). Despite these insights, the specific cargos or binding partners for SNX21 have not yet been fully identified, and its functional mechanism in endocytic pathways remains to be further investigated (Qi2024The).

## Interactions
SNX21 is involved in various protein interactions, primarily through its PX domain, which binds to phosphoinositides such as PtdIns(3)P. This binding facilitates its recruitment to early endosomes and newly forming Salmonella-containing vacuoles (SCVs) in cells, indicating a role in endosomal trafficking and pathogen invasion (Qi2024The). SNX21 also contains a unique C-terminal PXB domain with tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which are known for mediating protein-protein interactions, suggesting that SNX21 may act as a scaffold in endosomal trafficking (Qi2024The).

Despite these structural features, specific protein interaction partners for SNX21 have not been conclusively identified. Attempts to confirm interactions with proteins such as CD8-PSGL1 were unsuccessful, possibly due to low affinity or transient interactions (Qi2024The). A novel APEX-mediated biotinylation approach was employed to identify potential interacting proteins, but challenges such as false positives and low expression levels were encountered (Qi2024The). The study suggests that SNX21 may be involved in the endosomal system during Salmonella invasion, as it is enriched on endosomal structures due to its phosphoinositide binding (Qi2024The).
