# PROK2

## Overview
Prokineticin 2 (PROK2) is a gene that encodes the protein prokineticin 2, which is a member of the prokineticin family of secreted proteins. This protein is characterized by its interaction with G protein-coupled receptors, specifically prokineticin receptor 1 (PROKR1) and prokineticin receptor 2 (PROKR2), and plays a significant role in various physiological processes. Prokineticin 2 is involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms, gastrointestinal motility, and cardiovascular functions, as well as in neurogenesis and immune responses (Cheng2002Prokineticin; Ngan2008Prokineticinsignaling). The gene's mutations are linked to clinical conditions such as Kallmann syndrome and normosmic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, highlighting its importance in reproductive and olfactory development (Dodé2006Kallmann; Martin2010The). The diverse roles of PROK2 underscore its critical function in maintaining physiological homeostasis across multiple systems.

## Structure
Prokineticin 2 (PROK2) is a protein characterized by a unique structural motif that includes five disulfide bonds formed by 10 cysteine residues, which are crucial for its biological activity (Ngan2008Prokineticinsignaling; Zhou2006The). The primary structure of PROK2 features a conserved N-terminal hexapeptide sequence, AVITGA, essential for its function (Dodé2006Kallmann; Zhou2006The). This sequence is shared with its homolog, prokineticin 1 (Prok-1), and is critical for maintaining the protein's activity (Zhou2006The).

PROK2 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in a splice variant known as Prok-2L, which includes an additional 21 amino acids. This variant can be proteolytically cleaved to produce the active form, Prok-2β (Ngan2008Prokineticinsignaling). The structural integrity of the N-terminal sequence and the cysteine-rich domains are vital for the protein's function, as any disruption can lead to loss of activity (Zhou2006The).

The protein's tertiary structure is defined by a colipase fold, a feature conserved across species, including amphibians, fish, and mammals (Negri2009Chapter). This fold is integral to the protein's stability and function.

## Function
Prokineticin 2 (PROK2) is a protein involved in various physiological processes, primarily through its interaction with G protein-coupled receptors, prokineticin receptor 1 (PROKR1) and prokineticin receptor 2 (PROKR2). In the central nervous system, PROK2 plays a crucial role in regulating circadian rhythms by acting as an output molecule from the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), where its mRNA expression is rhythmically controlled and responsive to light entrainment (Cheng2002Prokineticin). It influences neuronal activity by modulating ion currents and neurotransmitter release, affecting electrical activity in brain regions such as the SCN, hypothalamus, and amygdala (Magnan2021Pleiotropic).

PROK2 is also involved in gastrointestinal motility, where it stimulates smooth muscle contractions, indicating its role in gut motility (Li2001Identification). In the cardiovascular system, PROK2 supports cardiomyocyte survival and angiogenesis, promoting vessel-like formation in cardiac endothelial cells (Ngan2008Prokineticinsignaling). Additionally, PROK2 is implicated in energy balance and metabolism, influencing feeding behavior and insulin sensitivity, with potential links to metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes (Magnan2021Pleiotropic; Mortreux2019New). These diverse functions highlight PROK2's significant role in maintaining physiological homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PROK2 gene are associated with Kallmann syndrome (KS) and normosmic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nIHH), both of which involve isolated GnRH deficiency. KS is characterized by anosmia and reproductive issues due to developmental defects in olfactory bulb neurogenesis and GnRH neuronal migration. In contrast, nIHH presents with normal olfaction but similar reproductive challenges, indicating a functional defect at the hypothalamo-pituitary axis (Dodé2006Kallmann; Martin2010The).

Mutations in PROK2 can lead to a range of reproductive and olfactory phenotypes, with variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance. This means individuals with the same mutation may exhibit different symptoms, from severe reproductive issues to being seemingly unaffected (Martin2010The). In some cases, mutations in PROK2 result in significant impairment in intracellular calcium influx, affecting signaling pathways crucial for normal reproductive development (Martin2010The).

The genetic transmission of KS can be complex, involving potential digenic or oligogenic inheritance patterns. This complexity is highlighted by the presence of mutations in both PROK2 and other genes like KAL1 and FGFR1, which together account for about 30% of KS cases (Leroy2008Biallelic; Dodé2006Kallmann).

## Interactions
PROK2 (prokineticin 2) interacts with G-protein coupled receptors, specifically PROKR1 and PROKR2, to mediate various physiological processes. These interactions are crucial for activating intracellular signaling pathways, including calcium mobilization and the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (Ngan2008Prokineticinsignaling). PROK2 exhibits a higher affinity for PROKR2 compared to PROKR1, which influences its role in neurogenesis, angiogenesis, and immune response (Ngan2008Prokineticinsignaling).

In the central nervous system, PROK2 is involved in promoting neuronal survival and olfactory bulb morphogenesis. It acts as a chemoattractant for neuronal progenitors, facilitating their migration and differentiation (Dodé2013PROK2PROKR2). In the peripheral nervous system, PROK2 lowers nociceptor thresholds and induces hyperalgesia by interacting with TRPV1 in dorsal root ganglion neurons (Ngan2008Prokineticinsignaling).

PROK2 also plays a role in the regulation of circadian rhythms, with its mRNA levels showing circadian oscillation in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (Dodé2013PROK2PROKR2). Additionally, PROK2 is involved in haematopoiesis and immune response regulation, promoting the survival and differentiation of hematopoietic cells (Ngan2008Prokineticinsignaling). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of PROK2 in various biological processes.
