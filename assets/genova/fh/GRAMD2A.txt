# GRAMD2A

## Overview
GRAMD2A is a gene that encodes the protein GRAM domain containing 2A, which is integral to the organization and function of endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane (ER-PM) contact sites in human cells. The protein is characterized by its GRAM domain, which facilitates its role as a tether at these contact sites, enabling communication and lipid exchange between the ER and the plasma membrane. GRAMD2A is involved in lipid metabolism and plays a crucial role in calcium signaling by pre-marking ER-PM contact sites for the recruitment of STIM1, a key component in store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) (Besprozvannaya2018GRAM). The protein's interaction with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) is essential for its function, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis and calcium signaling pathways (Besprozvannaya2018GRAM).

## Structure


## Function
GRAMD2A is a protein that plays a significant role in the organization and function of endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane (ER-PM) contact sites in human cells. It localizes to these contact sites, where it functions as a tether, facilitating communication and lipid exchange between the ER and the plasma membrane (Besprozvannaya2018GRAM). GRAMD2A is involved in lipid metabolism, as it shows positive correlations with genes in this pathway, suggesting its role in lipid homeostasis (Besprozvannaya2018GRAM).

The protein is particularly important in calcium signaling, as it pre-marks ER-PM contact sites for the recruitment of STIM1, a key player in store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) (Besprozvannaya2018GRAM). GRAMD2A's interaction with the plasma membrane is mediated by its GRAM domain, which binds specifically to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), a lipid enriched at ER-PM contact sites (Besprozvannaya2018GRAM). This interaction is crucial for the dynamic regulation of calcium signaling pathways, as GRAMD2A facilitates the recruitment of STIM1 during SOCE, although its absence does not significantly affect the overall SOCE response due to redundancy with other tethers (Besprozvannaya2018GRAM).

## Interactions
GRAMD2A is involved in interactions at the endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane (ER-PM) contact sites, primarily through its association with specific lipids and proteins. GRAMD2A localizes to ER-PM contact sites by binding to phosphoinositide lipids, particularly PI(4,5)P2, which is crucial for its function as a tether at these sites (Besprozvannaya2018GRAM; Balla2020Phosphoinositides). This lipid-dependent localization allows GRAMD2A to pre-mark ER-PM microdomains for the recruitment of STIM1, a key protein in store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) (NietoGarai2022SuperResolution; Besprozvannaya2018GRAM).

GRAMD2A interacts with E-Syt2 and E-Syt3, proteins involved in ER-PM tethering, although its localization is independent of these proteins, as shown by unchanged patterns in E-Syt1/2/3 triple knockout cells (Besprozvannaya2018GRAM). The interaction with STIM1 is dynamic; GRAMD2A initially co-localizes with STIM1 at ER-PM contacts but later becomes spatially resolved, suggesting a role in forming distinct microdomains during SOCE (Besprozvannaya2018GRAM; Balla2019Lipid). These interactions highlight GRAMD2A's role in organizing ER-PM contact sites and facilitating calcium signaling processes. There is no evidence of GRAMD2A interacting directly with nucleic acids (NietoGarai2022SuperResolution).
