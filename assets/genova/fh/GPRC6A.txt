# GPRC6A

## Overview
GPRC6A is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor class C group 6 member A, a receptor that belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This receptor is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain and is involved in a variety of physiological processes, including the mediation of non-genomic effects of androgens and the sensing of extracellular cations such as calcium. GPRC6A is activated by ligands such as testosterone and osteocalcin, influencing pathways critical for bone metabolism, insulin secretion, and glucose homeostasis. The receptor's broad expression across tissues like bone, pancreas, and muscle underscores its role in integrating metabolic functions. Mutations and polymorphisms in the GPRC6A gene have been associated with metabolic disorders, bone health issues, and reproductive anomalies, highlighting its clinical significance in conditions such as metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and prostate cancer susceptibility (Jørgensen2020Pharmacology; Pi2010GPRC6A; Pi2010Impaired).

## Structure
The GPRC6A protein is a member of the family C G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and consists of 926 amino acids, featuring a seven-transmembrane (7TM) domain typical of GPCRs (Wellendorph2004Molecular). It has an unusually long amino-terminal domain (ATD) of 590 amino acids, which is believed to serve as the binding site for its endogenous ligand (Wellendorph2004Molecular). The protein structure includes conserved cysteine residues in the cysteine-rich region (CRR) and extracellular loops, which are important for receptor function and cell surface expression (Wellendorph2004Molecular).

GPRC6A is characterized by a Venus-flytrap (VFT) domain for ligand binding and a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) for signal transfer (NørskovLauritsen2015N‐glycosylation). The receptor is N-glycosylated, with seven N-glycans identified, which affect its surface expression and function (NørskovLauritsen2015N‐glycosylation). GPRC6A forms homodimers through disulfide bridges, specifically between C131 residues (NørskovLauritsen2015N‐glycosylation).

There are three isoforms of GPRC6A, with isoforms 2 and 3 having in-frame deletions in the ATD. Isoform 1 is the most abundant and is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, kidney, skeletal muscle, testis, and leucocytes (Wellendorph2004Molecular).

## Function
The GPRC6A gene encodes a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a significant role in mediating non-genomic effects of androgens, such as testosterone, in various tissues. This receptor is involved in rapid signaling responses to testosterone, distinct from the genomic actions mediated by androgen receptors. GPRC6A is activated by testosterone, leading to the activation of ERK signaling pathways, which are crucial for cell proliferation and other cellular responses (Pi2010GPRC6A).

GPRC6A is also a sensor for extracellular cations, including calcium, and is activated by osteocalcin, a bone-derived peptide. This receptor is expressed in multiple tissues, including bone, where it plays a role in bone metabolism and calcium homeostasis. In bone, GPRC6A influences osteoblast function and bone mineralization, as evidenced by impaired bone mineralization in GPRC6A null mice (Pi2010Impaired; Pi2005Identification).

In pancreatic β-cells, GPRC6A is involved in insulin production and secretion, activated by osteocalcin, which stimulates ERK and cAMP pathways. This receptor is crucial for maintaining β-cell mass and insulin secretion, impacting glucose metabolism (Pi2016Evidence). GPRC6A's broad expression and activation by various ligands suggest its role in integrating metabolic functions across different tissues (Pi2015Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the GPRC6A gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. GPRC6A deficiency in mice leads to metabolic syndrome, characterized by glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, obesity, and hepatic steatosis, suggesting a similar role in humans (Pi2017GPRC6A:; Pi2008GPRC6A). The rs2274911 polymorphism in the GPRC6A gene is associated with insulin resistance in both normal weight and obese individuals, indicating a predisposition to type 2 diabetes and other metabolic disorders (Di2016The).

GPRC6A is also implicated in bone health. Deficiency in this gene results in osteopenia and impaired bone mineralization in mice, and SNPs in the GPRC6A region are associated with reduced spinal bone mineral density in humans (Pi2010Impaired). In terms of reproductive health, GPRC6A knockout models show feminization effects and altered hormone levels, with SNPs linked to infertility and conditions like oligozoospermia and cryptorchidism (Jørgensen2020Pharmacology).

GPRC6A has been identified as a prostate cancer susceptibility locus, with studies suggesting that its loss of functionality may protect against prostate cancer (Jørgensen2020Pharmacology). These findings highlight the gene's significant role in various physiological and pathological processes.

## Interactions
GPRC6A, a G protein-coupled receptor, engages in various physical interactions with proteins and ligands. It interacts with osteocalcin (Ocn), which binds to the receptor's Venus fly trap (VFT) motif and 7-transmembrane (7-TM) domain. This interaction is crucial for the activation of GPRC6A, with specific amino acid fragments of Ocn forming hydrogen bonds with GPRC6A residues such as Gln 19, Asp 26, and Lys 352 (Agarwal2022Osteocalcin). Mutations in the 7-TM domain can block Ocn's ability to activate the receptor (Pi2017GPRC6A:).

GPRC6A also interacts with testosterone, which is predicted to bind to the 7-TM domain. Mutations in this domain can disrupt testosterone activation of the receptor (Pi2017GPRC6A:). The receptor forms dimers on the cell surface, a process dependent on disulfide bonding involving cysteine residues C122 and C131. Mutations at these sites disrupt dimer formation, indicating their importance in maintaining the receptor's dimeric structure (NørskovLauritsen2015N‐glycosylation).

The receptor undergoes constitutive internalization and is sorted through the slow recycling pathway, interacting with endocytic markers such as Rab5 and Rab11 (Jacobsen2017The). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms governing GPRC6A's function and signaling.
