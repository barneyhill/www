# TRA2A

## Overview
TRA2A is a gene that encodes the transformer 2 alpha homolog protein, a member of the SR protein family known for its role in RNA binding and regulation of alternative splicing. This protein is integral to the splicing of both constitutive and alternative exons, which is vital for cellular processes such as DNA damage response and cell viability (Best2014Human). TRA2A is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it functions as a splicing factor, contributing to the generation of diverse protein isoforms by modulating exon inclusion or exclusion during mRNA processing (Best2014Tra2). The protein's structure is characterized by domains rich in arginine and serine residues, typical of SR proteins, although TRA2A is specifically involved in alternative splicing (Best2014Human). Its interactions with various proteins and nucleic acids underscore its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states, including cancer and viral infections (Zhu2020Human; Cao2023LncZEB219).

## Function
TRA2A, a member of the transformer 2 homolog family, is a crucial RNA-binding protein involved in the regulation of alternative splicing in human cells. It plays a significant role in controlling the splicing of both constitutive and alternative exons, which is essential for maintaining cell viability and proper DNA damage response (Best2014Human). TRA2A, along with its paralog TRA2B, regulates a variety of target exons, including those associated with chromosome biology, such as CHEK1, which is involved in the DNA damage response (Best2014Human).

TRA2A is active in the nucleus, where it functions as a splicing factor, influencing the inclusion or exclusion of specific exons during mRNA processing. This activity contributes to the diversity of protein isoforms in cells, impacting various cellular processes (Best2014Tra2). The protein contains domains enriched in arginine and serine residues, characteristic of SR proteins involved in splicing, although TRA2 proteins are primarily implicated in alternative splicing (Best2014Human).

In healthy human cells, TRA2A is part of a feedback control mechanism that buffers splicing defects, ensuring the proper expression of full-length proteins and preventing the accumulation of DNA damage markers (Best2014Human).

## Clinical Significance
The TRA2A gene has been implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression and interactions. In esophageal cancer, TRA2A is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis, including shorter disease-free and overall survival times. This overexpression is linked to the activation of the EZH2/β-catenin pathway through its interaction with the lncRNA MALAT1, promoting cancer progression (Zhao2021TRA2A).

In glioma, TRA2A is significantly upregulated, enhancing tumor cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Its overexpression correlates with increased levels of proteins associated with cell proliferation and invasion, such as Ki67 and MMP9, while reducing E-cadherin expression, indicating its role in glioma malignancy (Tan2018TRA2A).

TRA2A also plays a role in Alzheimer's disease by modulating blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. It stabilizes the long non-coding RNA LINC00662, which affects the expression of tight junction proteins, thereby increasing BBB permeability. This mechanism suggests TRA2A's involvement in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (Liu2020TRA2Ainduced).

Additionally, TRA2A influences the adaptation of influenza A viruses to human hosts by regulating viral mRNA splicing, which is crucial for viral replication and pathogenicity (Zhu2020Human).

## Interactions
TRA2A, a splicing regulator, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TRA2A interacts with the long non-coding RNA lnc-ZEB2-19. This interaction regulates TRA2A protein expression by promoting its degradation, which in turn affects the stability of RSPH14 mRNA. This regulatory axis is significant in modulating HCC progression and lenvatinib resistance (Cao2023LncZEB219).

TRA2A also plays a role in the splicing of influenza A virus mRNA. It binds to specific motifs in the viral mRNAs, such as the ISS motif, which inhibits splicing and affects viral replication and pathogenicity. This interaction is crucial for the virus's adaptation and replication in host cells (Zhu2020Human).

In the context of fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), TRA2A is recruited into nuclear inclusions formed by CGG repeats. This recruitment is dependent on the hairpin structure of the repeats and affects RNA splicing, leading to exon skipping in various genes. TRA2A's sequestration in these inclusions is significant in understanding FXTAS pathogenesis (CidSamper2018An).
