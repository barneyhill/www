# LOXL1

## Overview
The LOXL1 gene encodes the lysyl oxidase-like 1 protein, a member of the lysyl oxidase family, which is primarily involved in the biogenesis of connective tissue by catalyzing the cross-linking of collagen and elastin fibers. This enzyme is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and elasticity of various tissues, including the skin, lungs, and blood vessels (Greene2020Lysyl; Liu2004Elastic). LOXL1 is synthesized as a preproenzyme and undergoes post-translational modifications to become an active enzyme, which is essential for its function in the extracellular matrix (Greene2020Lysyl; Iturbide2014A). The protein's activity is regulated by several signaling pathways, and it interacts with other proteins such as fibulin-5, playing a significant role in elastogenesis (RosellGarcía2022Cleavage). Genetic variations in LOXL1 have been linked to exfoliation syndrome and exfoliation glaucoma, highlighting its clinical significance in ocular health (Aboobakar2014Genetics; Li2021LOXL1).

## Structure
The LOXL1 protein is synthesized as a 90 kDa preproenzyme, which includes a signal peptide, a propeptide region, and a catalytic domain. Upon secretion, the signal peptide is cleaved, resulting in a pro-enzyme form that is further processed by bone morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP-1) into an active 62 kDa enzyme and a 28 kDa pro-peptide (Greene2020Lysyl; RosellGarcía2022Cleavage). The primary structure of LOXL1 includes a conserved C-terminal domain essential for its enzymatic activity, featuring a copper-binding site and a lysyl tyrosylquinone (LTQ) cofactor, which are crucial for its function in cross-linking collagen and elastin (Greene2020Lysyl).

The secondary structure of LOXL1 is characterized by beta-sheets and alpha-helices, contributing to its stability and function. The tertiary structure includes a copper-binding site and the LTQ cofactor, which are vital for its catalytic activity (Greene2020Lysyl). LOXL1 can form homodimers, indicating a quaternary structure that may be important for its function in the extracellular matrix (Iturbide2014A).

Post-translational modifications of LOXL1 include glycosylation and proteolytic cleavage, which are important for its secretion and activation (Iturbide2014A). The protein's N-terminal region is predicted to be disordered, which may influence its interactions and susceptibility to proteolytic processing (RosellGarcía2022Cleavage).

## Function
The LOXL1 gene encodes the lysyl oxidase-like 1 protein, which plays a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of elastic fibers in connective tissues. LOXL1 is involved in the cross-linking of tropoelastin monomers into mature elastin polymers, a process essential for elastogenesis and the structural integrity of tissues such as the skin, lungs, and blood vessels (Greene2020Lysyl; Liu2004Elastic). This enzyme is specifically targeted to sites of elastogenesis, where it interacts with fibulin-5 to ensure the proper localization and deposition of elastin fibers (RosellGarcía2022Cleavage; Liu2004Elastic).

LOXL1 is synthesized as a preproenzyme and secreted as a pro-enzyme, which is then activated by proteolytic cleavage, primarily by bone morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP-1) (Greene2020Lysyl). The enzyme's activity is regulated by several intracellular signaling pathways, including those induced by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), which influence its transcription and function (Greene2020Lysyl). In healthy cells, LOXL1 contributes to the resilience and elasticity of tissues by facilitating the cross-linking of elastin and collagen, thereby maintaining the extracellular matrix's structural integrity (Greene2020Lysyl).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the LOXL1 gene are significantly associated with exfoliation syndrome (XFS) and exfoliation glaucoma (XFG), conditions characterized by the accumulation of abnormal fibrillar material in ocular tissues, leading to increased intraocular pressure and potential vision loss (Aboobakar2014Genetics; Li2021LOXL1). Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in LOXL1, such as rs1048661 (Arg141Leu) and rs3825942 (Gly153Asp), have been identified as major genetic risk factors for these conditions, although their risk allele frequencies vary among different ethnic populations (Aboobakar2014Genetics; Fan2011LOXL1Promoter). The promoter region SNPs, including rs12914489 and rs16958477, are also associated with increased disease risk and may influence LOXL1 gene expression, potentially reducing enzyme activity and predisposing individuals to disease (Aboobakar2014Genetics; Fan2011LOXL1Promoter).

In Spanish populations, the C allele of rs16958477 and the T allele of rs2165241 are significant risk factors for XFG, with certain haplotypes like CGGT and AGGT conferring increased risk (Álvarez2015LOXL1). Despite these associations, LOXL1 variants are not linked to other forms of glaucoma, indicating a specific genetic distinction for XFG (Aboobakar2014Genetics).

## Interactions
LOXL1 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. In glioma, LOXL1 interacts with BAG2, a protein known for its antiapoptotic activity. This interaction is crucial for glioma progression as LOXL1 stabilizes BAG2 by preventing its ubiquitylation at lysine 186, thereby enhancing the antiapoptotic capacity of glioma cells (Yu2020LOXL1). The interaction between LOXL1 and BAG2 is dependent on LOXL1's enzymatic activity, with the C-terminal region of LOXL1 being particularly important for this interaction (Yu2020LOXL1).

In colorectal cancer, LOXL1 interacts with MST1/2 kinases, which are part of the Hippo signaling pathway. This interaction leads to increased phosphorylation of YAP, a key regulator of cell proliferation and survival, thereby inhibiting its transcriptional activity. This suggests that LOXL1 acts as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating YAP activity (Hu2020LOXL1).

LOXL1 also interacts with fibulin-5, a protein involved in elastic fiber formation. This interaction is facilitated by a segment near LOXL1's catalytic domain and is crucial for its function in elastogenesis (RosellGarcía2022Cleavage).
