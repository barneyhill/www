# HSDL1

## Overview
HSDL1 is a gene that encodes the hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-like 1 protein, which is categorized as a hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-like protein. Despite its classification, HSDL1 is believed to be enzymatically inactive due to a substitution in its active site, distinguishing it from other active hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases. The protein is implicated in various cellular interactions, notably with STYXL1, a non-mitochondrial protein involved in mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis, suggesting a potential regulatory role in apoptosis (Monti2018Update). Additionally, HSDL1 has been identified as a nitrosylated protein in Alzheimer's disease models, indicating a possible involvement in neuroinflammatory processes (Wijasa2019Quantitative). While the precise biological functions and clinical implications of HSDL1 remain to be fully elucidated, its interactions and modifications suggest a multifaceted role in cellular processes and disease mechanisms.

## Clinical Significance
The HSDL1 gene has been studied in various contexts, but specific diseases directly resulting from its mutations or expression alterations are not well-documented. In ovarian cancer, the HSDL1 L25V mutation has been identified as a neoantigen that elicits a T cell response, suggesting its potential role in the immune response to cancer. This mutation was found to be rare in primary tumors but more abundant at recurrence, indicating its possible involvement in tumor progression (Martin2017A).

In breast cancer, HSDL1 was identified as one of the genes differentially expressed by race among Luminal A breast tumors, although it was not associated with survival outcomes (D’Arcy2015Raceassociated). Additionally, deletions involving the HSDL1 gene have been observed in the context of primary ciliary dyskinesia, although the specific impact of these deletions on the condition remains unclear (Loges2009Deletions).

Research in other species, such as the orange-spotted grouper, has shown that HSDL1 is involved in steroid metabolism, but its expression levels did not significantly change during sex reversal, suggesting a role in maintaining specific biological processes rather than directly influencing sex reversal events (Xiao2020BetaHydroxysteroid).

## Interactions
HSDL1, a hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-like protein, is involved in various interactions that may influence its function. Although HSDL1 is expected to be enzymatically inactive due to a substitution in its active site, it has been shown to interact with STYXL1, a non-mitochondrial protein. STYXL1 is an inactive phosphatase known to regulate mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis, suggesting that HSDL1 may play a role in modulating STYXL1's activity at the mitochondrial level (Monti2018Update).

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, HSDL1 has been identified as a nitrosylated protein, indicating potential involvement in neuroinflammatory processes. This modification was observed in a study investigating synaptic proteins in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model, highlighting HSDL1 as one of the proteins affected by age and genotype (Wijasa2019Quantitative).

Despite these findings, the specific biological significance of HSDL1's interactions and modifications remains unclear, and further research is needed to elucidate its role in cellular processes and disease mechanisms.
