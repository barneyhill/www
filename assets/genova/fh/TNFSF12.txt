# TNFSF12

## Overview
TNFSF12 is a gene that encodes the protein known as TNF superfamily member 12, commonly referred to as TWEAK. TWEAK is a type II transmembrane protein and a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily, characterized by its involvement in various cellular processes, including inflammation, cell proliferation, and tissue regeneration. The protein is expressed by several types of leukocytes and interacts with the fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14) receptor, playing a pivotal role in activating signaling pathways such as NF-κB and MAPK. These pathways are crucial for immune responses, cell survival, and tissue repair. TWEAK can also be cleaved into a soluble form that retains biological activity, further influencing processes like angiogenesis and fibrosis. The gene's expression and function have significant implications in various pathological conditions, including cancer, fibrosis, and immune deficiencies, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Wiley2003TWEAK; Enwere2014Role; Burkly2011TWEAKFn14).

## Structure
The TNFSF12 gene encodes the TWEAK protein, a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily. The TWEAK protein is a 249-amino acid polypeptide with a hydrophobic N-terminal region that anchors it into the cell membrane, classifying it as a type II transmembrane protein (Wiley2003TWEAK). The N-terminal cytoplasmic domain is relatively short, consisting of 18 amino acids, and contains a putative serine phosphorylation site. The C-terminal extracellular domain, which is 206 amino acids long, contains the receptor-binding subdomain and is predicted to fold into a β-pleated sheet structure that forms a trimeric aggregate. This trimeric structure is typical of TNF superfamily members and facilitates receptor binding (Wiley2003TWEAK).

TWEAK can be proteolytically processed into a soluble form, primarily consisting of the C-terminal receptor-binding subdomain, which can also form homotrimers. This soluble form is biologically active and is consistent with the presence of a consensus sequence motif for furin cleavage in the extracellular domain (Wiley2003TWEAK). TWEAK is a glycoprotein, as indicated by a consensus sequence motif for N-glycosylation at position 139 (Wiley2003TWEAK).

## Function
TNFSF12, also known as TWEAK, is a cytokine that plays a significant role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in the regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathways, which are crucial for immune responses and cell survival. TWEAK interacts with its receptor, Fn14, to activate both canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathways. In healthy cells, TWEAK at physiological concentrations does not activate the canonical NF-κB pathway but can robustly activate the non-canonical pathway, which is involved in processes such as myogenesis and muscle homeostasis (Enwere2014Role).

TWEAK is expressed by various leukocytes, including monocytes and natural killer cells, and acts on the Fn14 receptor, which is upregulated in response to tissue injury. This interaction promotes tissue regeneration and repair following acute injury by stimulating cell proliferation and migration, as well as inducing proinflammatory responses (Wiley2003TWEAK; Burkly2011TWEAKFn14). TWEAK also has a role in angiogenesis, comparable to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), by promoting endothelial cell proliferation and migration (Wiley2003TWEAK). These functions highlight TWEAK's importance in maintaining tissue homeostasis and facilitating repair processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the TNFSF12 gene, also known as TWEAK, have been implicated in various diseases. In neural tube defects (NTDs), TNFSF12 is downregulated, potentially due to abnormal histone H3K27 acetylation, which affects gene expression and may contribute to the development of these congenital malformations (Wan2018Regulation). In diffuse gliomas, TNFSF12 is associated with a poorer prognosis, acting as a risk factor with a hazard ratio greater than 1, indicating its role in disease progression (Wang2022Comprehensive). 

In the context of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), TNFSF12 is classified as a disease-susceptibility gene, with genetic variants potentially impacting antibody response and leading to recurrent infections (Bisgin2021The). Additionally, a mutation in TNFSF12 has been identified in gastric cancer peritoneal carcinomatosis, where it may influence metastasis by upregulating VEGF through the NF-κB signaling pathway (Lim2016Genetic). These findings highlight the clinical significance of TNFSF12 in various conditions, emphasizing its role in disease mechanisms and potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
TNFSF12, also known as TWEAK, is a cytokine that interacts with the fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14) receptor, also known as TNFRSF12A. This interaction is crucial for various cellular processes, including cell survival, proliferation, and inflammation. The TNFSF12-Fn14 signaling pathway is involved in tissue repair and is activated through the recruitment of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors (TRAFs), specifically TRAF2 and TRAF5, which subsequently activate the NF-kB and MAPK pathways (Dostert2019The).

In the context of severe COVID-19, TNFSF12 is secreted by alveolar macrophages and binds to the TNFRSF12A receptor on fibroblasts, promoting fibroblast proliferation and pulmonary fibrosis. This interaction enhances the expression of fibrosis-related factors such as αSMA, Collagen I, and Fibronectin, contributing to the progression of pulmonary fibrosis (Guo2024Communication).

In breast cancer, TNFSF12 expression is associated with poor prognosis and is linked to the activation of KRAS signaling, TNFA signaling via NF-kB, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). It interacts with TRAF and NF-kB signaling pathways, influencing angiogenesis, proliferation, apoptosis, and fibrosis (Chen2024TNFSF12).
