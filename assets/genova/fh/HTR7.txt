# HTR7

## Overview
The HTR7 gene encodes the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 7 (5-HT7R), a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a pivotal role in serotonin signaling. This receptor is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains, a structural feature typical of GPCRs, facilitating its function in signal transduction across cellular membranes (Matthys2011Role). The 5-HT7R is primarily expressed in the central nervous system, where it influences various physiological processes, including mood regulation, cognition, and circadian rhythms (Ruat1993Molecular; Hoyer2002Molecular). The receptor's activity is mediated through its coupling with Gs proteins, leading to increased intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels, which are crucial for downstream signaling pathways (Barnes2020International). The HTR7 gene and its encoded receptor have been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia, as well as in certain cancers, highlighting their clinical significance and potential as therapeutic targets (Helsmoortel2016Whole; Ikeda2005Positive; Sheng2021HTR7).

## Structure
The HTR7 gene encodes the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 7 (5-HT7R), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in serotonin signaling. This receptor is characterized by its seven transmembrane helices, a hallmark of GPCRs, which facilitate its role in signal transduction across the cell membrane (Matthys2011Role). The receptor's structure includes extracellular, transmembrane, and intracellular domains, with the intracellular loop 3 (ICL3) playing a crucial role in interactions with other proteins, such as the tau kinase CDK5 (Ackmann2024Structural).

The 5-HT7R is known to undergo alternative splicing, resulting in multiple splice variants that may affect its function and localization (Matthys2011Role). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are suggested to modulate the receptor's activity and interactions, particularly in the context of CDK5 activation (Ackmann2024Structural).

The receptor's interaction with CDK5 is primarily stabilized by hydrophobic contacts involving specific phenylalanine residues, F278 and F281, within the ICL3. These residues are critical for the formation of the 5-HT7R/CDK5 complex, influencing downstream signaling pathways related to Tau protein phosphorylation and aggregation (Ackmann2024Structural).

## Function
The HTR7 gene encodes the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 7 (5-HT7), a G protein-coupled receptor involved in various molecular processes, primarily in the central nervous system. This receptor is positively coupled to adenylyl cyclase via Gs proteins, leading to increased intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels, which play a crucial role in cellular signaling pathways (Barnes2020International; Ruat1993Molecular). The 5-HT7 receptor is expressed in several brain regions, including the limbic system, thalamocortical regions, and the hippocampus, where it influences mood, cognition, and sleep patterns (Ruat1993Molecular; Hoyer2002Molecular).

The receptor is involved in modulating neurotransmission and cellular signaling, impacting processes such as circadian rhythms, thermoregulation, and synaptic plasticity (Speranza2017Serotonin; Kim20145HT7). It also plays a role in the formation of dendritic spines and synaptogenesis, which are essential for proper brain wiring and cognitive functions (Speranza2017Serotonin). The 5-HT7 receptor's activity is linked to the mTOR-mediated phosphorylation of proteins involved in spinogenesis, highlighting its importance in neuronal connectivity and maintenance (Speranza2017Serotonin).

## Clinical Significance
The HTR7 gene, encoding the 5-HT7 serotonin receptor, has been implicated in several neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. Mutations in HTR7 have been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A study identified compound heterozygous mutations in the HTR7 gene in a dizygotic twin with ASD, suggesting a potential link between these genetic abnormalities and the disorder (Helsmoortel2016Whole). 

In schizophrenia, the HTR7 gene has been associated with the disorder in a Japanese population. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene, such as SNP2 and SNP5, have shown significant associations with schizophrenia, indicating that HTR7 may be a susceptibility gene for this condition (Ikeda2005Positive). 

Alterations in HTR7 expression have also been linked to cancer. In laryngeal cancer, HTR7 is significantly upregulated, promoting tumor growth through the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. High HTR7 expression correlates with poor patient outcomes, suggesting its role as a prognostic biomarker (Sheng2021HTR7). 

The receptor's involvement in these conditions highlights its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
The HTR7 gene encodes the 5-HT7 receptor, which is involved in several protein interactions. One significant interaction is with the tau kinase CDK5. The 5-HT7 receptor recruits CDK5 to the plasma membrane, forming a complex that does not require the Gs protein. This interaction is crucial for CDK5 activation and subsequent tau phosphorylation, which is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. The interaction is mediated by specific residues within the receptor, particularly phenylalanine residues F278 and F281, which are essential for the hydrophobic interactions with CDK5. Mutations at these residues impair the interaction and reduce CDK5 activation (Ackmann2024Structural).

The 5-HT7 receptor also interacts with other proteins in signaling pathways. It is coupled to the Gs protein, leading to increased intracellular cAMP levels and activation of downstream effectors like AKT and ERK. This receptor can also interact with G12 proteins, activating Rho family GTPases, which are involved in various cellular processes (Courant2022Expression). These interactions highlight the receptor's role in both neurological and immune system functions, influencing processes such as cytokine production and cell morphology (QuinteroVillegas2019Role).
