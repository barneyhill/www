# OIP5

## Overview
OIP5 (Opa interacting protein 5) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in essential cellular processes, particularly in chromatin organization and cell cycle regulation. The protein, also known as Mis18beta, is crucial for the recruitment of centromere protein A (CENPA) to centromeres, ensuring proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. This function is vital for maintaining chromosomal stability and proper cell division (Chun2010OIP5; Mobasheri2015CancerTestis). OIP5 is predominantly localized in the nucleus and cytosol, reflecting its role in nuclear processes. The protein is implicated in various cancers, where its altered expression is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Chow2021Prognostic; Zhu2022Characterization).

## Structure


## Function
OIP5 (Opa interacting protein 5) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in critical cellular processes, particularly in chromatin organization and cell cycle regulation. In healthy human cells, OIP5 is essential for the recruitment of centromere protein A (CENPA) to centromeres, which is crucial for normal chromosome segregation during mitosis (Mobasheri2015CancerTestis). This process ensures that newly synthesized CENPA is deposited in nucleosomes at the centromeres during the late telophase/early G1 phase of the cell cycle, maintaining stable association with the centromere and ensuring equal division to daughter centromeres during the S phase (Mobasheri2015CancerTestis).

OIP5 is also known as Mis18beta and is vital for the structure and function of centromeres/kinetochores, accumulating specifically at the telophase-G1 centromere (Chun2010OIP5). Its protein levels are upregulated during the G1 phase in proliferating cells and upon cell cycle exit in quiescent, senescent, and differentiating cells, indicating its role in cell cycle control (Chun2010OIP5). The subcellular localization of OIP5 is mainly in the nucleus and cytosol, reflecting its involvement in nuclear processes (Mobasheri2015CancerTestis). These functions suggest that OIP5 plays a significant role in maintaining chromosomal stability and proper cell division.

## Clinical Significance
OIP5 (Opa interacting protein 5) is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In oral cancer, OIP5 is overexpressed in 73.2% of cases and is associated with poor prognosis and advanced disease stages. Its enforced expression promotes cell growth, while suppression leads to cell cycle arrest and increased senescence (Zhu2022Characterization). In papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC), OIP5 is upregulated and linked to tumorigenesis, poor prognosis, and metabolic shifts typical of cancer. It is essential for the survival of pRCC cells and is part of the Mis18 complex necessary for centromere formation (Chow2021Prognostic). OIP5 is also overexpressed in gastric, colorectal, and breast cancers, where it promotes cell proliferation and is associated with oncogenic properties (Mobasheri2015CancerTestis). In breast cancer, OIP5 overexpression is linked to tumor size and lymph node metastasis, although its clinical significance requires further research (Mobasheri2015CancerTestis). The gene's role in chromosomal stability and cell cycle regulation makes it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in these cancers.

## Interactions
OIP5 (Opa interacting protein 5) is known to participate in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cell cycle regulation and cancer progression. In colorectal cancer, OIP5 interacts with the mitotic spindle positioning protein (MISP), forming a complex that is believed to activate the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation and tumor progression (Hiura2024Mitotic). This interaction is supported by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses, which confirm the physical association between MISP and OIP5 (Hiura2024Mitotic).

OIP5 is also involved in centromere/kinetochore function, interacting with lamina-associated polypeptide 2α (LAP2α), which is essential for proper cell division (Hiura2024Mitotic). In bladder cancer, OIP5 is part of a regulatory network that includes interactions with several differentially expressed genes, such as CDH2, MYC, and IRS1, which are involved in pathways like JAK-STAT and Toll-like receptor signaling (He2017Exploration).

Additionally, OIP5 is regulated by the long noncoding RNA OIP5-AS1, which acts in cis to enhance OIP5 transcription through interactions with chromatin remodeling complexes, specifically the SWI/SNF complex (Wanowska2021A). This regulation highlights the complex interplay between OIP5 and nucleic acids in gene expression control.
