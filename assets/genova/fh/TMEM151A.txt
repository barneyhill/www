# TMEM151A

## Overview
TMEM151A is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 151A, which is primarily expressed in the central nervous system, including the brain and spinal cord. This protein is characterized by its transmembrane domains and is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it is believed to function as a calcium (Ca2+) channel involved in intracellular Ca2+ dynamics (Huang2023TMEM151A; Li2021TMEM151A). The TMEM151A protein plays a significant role in synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability, contributing to cellular communication and homeostasis within the central nervous system (Huang2023TMEM151A; Wirth2022De). Mutations in the TMEM151A gene have been linked to paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia, a neurological disorder characterized by involuntary movements, highlighting its clinical significance (Huang2023TMEM151A; Li2021TMEM151A).

## Structure
The TMEM151A protein is encoded by the TMEM151A gene and consists of 468 amino acids. It contains a Pfam domain spanning amino acids 26 to 373, as predicted by the SMART web tool (Huang2023TMEM151A). The protein is predicted to have two transmembrane domains, which suggests its role as a transmembrane protein (Huang2023TMEM151A). 

Several variants within the Pfam domain have been identified, including p.Val203fs, p.Gly56Arg, p.Val264Ala, and p.Gly332Arg. These variants may affect the protein's structure and function, as they are located in a domain that is generally intolerant to variation (Huang2023TMEM151A). The p.Gly56Arg variant, in particular, is located in the second transmembrane domain and is predicted to be damaging (Wirth2022De).

The protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting it may function as an ER-associated Ca2+ channel, playing a role in intracellular Ca2+ dynamics (Huang2023TMEM151A). The expression pattern of TMEM151A is similar to that of PRRT2, another gene associated with paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia, indicating a potential involvement in calcium signaling pathways (Huang2023TMEM151A).

## Function
TMEM151A is a transmembrane protein encoded by the TMEM151A gene, primarily expressed in the central nervous system, including the brain and spinal cord. It is highly conserved across species and is predominantly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in cells, suggesting a role as an ER-associated calcium (Ca2+) channel involved in intracellular Ca2+ dynamics (Huang2023TMEM151A; Li2021TMEM151A). The expression of TMEM151A is low during the embryonic period, increases postnatally, peaks at postnatal day 14, and declines in adulthood, which may correlate with its role in synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability (Huang2023TMEM151A; Li2021TMEM151A).

The protein is suggested to play a crucial role in regulating synaptic function, potentially impacting synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability (Huang2023TMEM151A; Wirth2022De). Although the precise molecular activities of TMEM151A in healthy human cells remain largely unknown, its involvement in these processes indicates a significant role in maintaining cellular communication and homeostasis within the central nervous system (Huang2023TMEM151A; Li2021TMEM151A). Further research is needed to elucidate the detailed molecular functions and organismal outcomes associated with TMEM151A.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TMEM151A gene have been associated with paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD), a neurological disorder characterized by sudden, involuntary movements triggered by voluntary actions. TMEM151A variants have been identified in both familial and sporadic cases of PKD, with frameshift and missense mutations being common. These mutations are thought to lead to a loss-of-function mechanism, as mutant TMEM151A proteins exhibit decreased expression levels (Huang2023TMEM151A; Li2021TMEM151A).

The TMEM151A gene is highly expressed in the central nervous system, particularly in the brain and spinal cord, and its expression pattern changes during development. This expression pattern may relate to the spontaneous remission observed in adult PKD patients (Huang2023TMEM151A). TMEM151A is suggested to function as an ER-associated Ca2+ channel, influencing intracellular calcium dynamics, which could affect synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability (Huang2023TMEM151A).

Clinical manifestations of PKD with TMEM151A mutations include dystonia, chorea, ballism, and epileptiform attacks. Many patients respond well to antiepileptic drugs like carbamazepine (Huang2023TMEM151A). The mutations are more prevalent in sporadic cases, possibly due to lower penetrance or de novo mutations (Huang2023TMEM151A).
