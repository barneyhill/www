# PSMA7

## Overview
PSMA7 is a gene that encodes the proteasome 20S subunit alpha 7, a critical component of the 20S core proteasome complex involved in protein degradation. This protein is categorized as a proteasome subunit and plays a vital role in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating protein turnover within cells (Heinemeyer2004Ubiquitin-proteasome). The PSMA7 protein is integral to the assembly and function of the proteasome, contributing to cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and stress response. It is subject to regulation by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation by kinases such as c-Abl, which modulate its activity and stability (Li2015cAbl; Liu2006Interaction). PSMA7's interactions with various proteins influence its role in cellular signaling pathways, and its dysregulation is implicated in several cancers, making it a potential biomarker for adverse prognosis (Sheng2024Pancaner).

## Structure
The PSMA7 protein, also known as proteasome 20S subunit alpha 7, is a component of the 20S core proteasome complex involved in protein degradation. The primary structure of PSMA7 consists of a sequence of 248 amino acids, with a calculated molecular weight of 27,900 and an isoelectric point of 8.72 (Elenich1999The). In terms of secondary structure, PSMA7, like other alpha subunits, features a core structure composed of two antiparallel beta sheets flanked by alpha helices, forming a sandwich-like topology (Löwe1995Crystal). 

The tertiary structure of PSMA7 contributes to its compact, globular shape, which is typical of proteasome subunits. In the quaternary structure, PSMA7 is part of the alpha ring in the 20S proteasome, which consists of four heptameric rings: two outer alpha rings and two inner beta rings (Heinemeyer2004Ubiquitin-proteasome). This arrangement is crucial for regulating access to the proteolytic chamber of the proteasome.

Post-translational modifications of PSMA7 include acetylation, which is a common modification that can affect the protein's function and interactions (Vimer2020Comparative). Additionally, a unique proteoform of PSMA7 has been identified in certain species, characterized by the absence of the last two amino acids, suggesting species-specific variations (Vimer2020Comparative).

## Function
PSMA7, or proteasome 20S subunit alpha 7, is a crucial component of the 20S core proteasome complex, which is integral to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway responsible for protein degradation in cells. This pathway is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis, regulating protein turnover, and facilitating cell cycle progression. PSMA7 is involved in the assembly and maturation of the proteasome, and its abundance and activity are regulated by the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase c-Abl, which phosphorylates PSMA7 at specific sites (Li2015cAbl; Liu2006Interaction).

The phosphorylation of PSMA7 by c-Abl at the Y106 site suppresses its ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation, thereby contributing to the regulation of proteasome abundance. This regulation is crucial for cellular processes such as protein turnover, cell proliferation, and stress responses (Li2015cAbl). PSMA7 is also phosphorylated at Y153 by c-Abl and Arg kinases, which inhibits proteasome activity and affects cell cycle transitions by modulating the degradation of cell cycle proteins like cyclin A, cyclin E, and p27 (Liu2006Interaction).

PSMA7 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, playing a role in various signaling pathways and contributing to cellular homeostasis (Padmanabhan2016Assembly).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the PSMA7 gene, particularly its amplification at chromosome 20q13.33, are frequently observed in various cancers and are associated with poor prognosis. PSMA7 amplification leads to increased gene expression, which is linked to adverse outcomes in multiple cancer types, including adrenocortical carcinoma, bladder cancer, and liver cancer (Sheng2024Pancaner). High expression levels of PSMA7 are correlated with poor overall survival and disease-free survival, making it a potential adverse prognostic biomarker (Sheng2024Pancaner).

PSMA7 is involved in proteasome and protease-related pathways, influencing tumorigenesis by interacting with proteins such as c-ABL, HIF-1α, and others, which are crucial for cellular activities like transcription control and cell cycle regulation (Sheng2024Pancaner). The gene's overexpression is also associated with genomic instability, as indicated by its relationship with microsatellite instability and tumor mutational burden (Sheng2024Pancaner).

In addition to its role in cancer, PSMA7's interaction with c-Abl kinase affects its degradation and expression levels, influencing proteasome abundance and activity. This interaction is crucial for maintaining proteasome homeostasis and is modulated by oxidative stress (Li2015cAbl; Liu2006Interaction).

## Interactions
PSMA7, a subunit of the 20S proteasome complex, is involved in various protein interactions. It interacts with the REGα/β (PA28 α/β) proteasomal activator, a relationship demonstrated through yeast two-hybrid experiments. This interaction is inhibited by a polypeptide derived from the hepatitis B virus X protein, which binds directly to PSMA7 (SánchezLanzas2014Proteins). PSMA7 also interacts with the N-terminal region of Rab7, participating in late endocytic transport without leading to Rab7 degradation (SánchezLanzas2014Proteins).

PSMA7 associates with MAVS, a mitochondrial membrane protein, inhibiting MAVS-mediated induction of IFN-β and acting as a negative regulator of antiviral signaling (Jia2009Negative). It also interacts with c-Abl and Arg tyrosine kinases, which phosphorylate PSMA7 at Tyr-153, affecting cell cycle transitions and proteasome activity (Liu2006Interaction). The interaction with c-Abl is enhanced under oxidative stress, leading to inhibited proteasomal activity (Liu2006Interaction).

PSMA7 binds with hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), and this interaction is regulated by calcineurin B, which inhibits HIF-1α degradation (SánchezLanzas2014Proteins). It also interacts with Endothelial Monocyte Activating Polypeptide-II (EMAP-II), which enhances HIF-1α degradation under hypoxic conditions (Tandle2009Endothelial).
