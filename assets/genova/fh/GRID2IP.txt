# GRID2IP

## Overview
GRID2IP, or Glutamate Receptor Delta-2 Interacting Protein, is a gene that encodes the protein Delphilin, which is primarily involved in synaptic signaling and neuronal communication. The protein is categorized as a synaptic scaffold protein due to its role in organizing and maintaining synaptic structures. Delphilin is predominantly expressed in the postsynaptic density of cerebellar Purkinje cells, where it interacts with the glutamate receptor delta-2 (GluRδ2) through its PDZ domain, playing a crucial role in synaptic plasticity and cerebellar function (Kawabata2019Multiple). The protein's interactions and regulatory mechanisms, including phosphorylation and binding with other proteins such as AP-2 and RSK1, underscore its importance in maintaining synaptic integrity and function (Gógl2019Rewiring; Tolve2024Endocytic). Mutations in the GRID2IP gene have been linked to various neurological disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Li2014Integrated; Cochran2019Genome).

## Function
GRID2IP, also known as Delphilin, is a protein that plays a significant role in synaptic signaling and neuronal communication. It is primarily expressed in the postsynaptic density of neurons, particularly in the cerebellar Purkinje cells, where it interacts with the glutamate receptor delta-2 (GluRδ2) via its PDZ domain (Kawabata2019Multiple). This interaction is crucial for synaptic plasticity and cerebellar function, contributing to the regulation of synaptic strength and coordination of motor activities (Kawabata2019Multiple).

GRID2IP is involved in the nucleation of actin filaments, binding to the barbed end without increasing elongation speed, similar to DAAM formins. This activity suggests a role in maintaining the structural integrity of synapses (Kawabata2019Multiple). The protein's interaction with GluRδ2 is regulated by phosphorylation, which can inhibit binding, indicating a complex regulatory mechanism involving calcium-sensitive kinases like PKA (Kawabata2019Multiple).

In the cerebellum, GRID2IP is enriched at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses, where it may control GRIP2 signaling, further implicating its role in synaptic organization and function (Reimann2014Whole). The protein's stability is regulated by the endocytic adaptor protein AP-2, which prevents its proteasomal degradation, thereby maintaining synaptic balance (Tolve2024Endocytic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GRID2IP gene have been implicated in several neurological conditions. In the context of autism spectrum disorders (ASD), rare non-synonymous mutations in GRID2IP have been identified, suggesting a potential link to neurological or behavioral conditions. Mouse models with mutations in GRID2IP exhibit abnormal reflexes, indicating its possible role in ASD (Li2014Integrated).

GRID2IP has also been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Variants in GRID2IP are more prevalent in AD patients compared to controls, although its exact role in AD remains unclear. The gene is expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cell-fiber synapses and acts as a postsynaptic scaffold protein, which may be relevant to its involvement in AD (Raghavan2018Whole‐exome). A specific loss-of-function splice variant in GRID2IP has been found in patients with early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD), suggesting a potential genetic link, although this association is not yet firmly established (Cochran2019Genome).

In the context of temporal lobe epilepsy, GRID2IP is uniquely hypermethylated, which may contribute to the pathophysiology of epilepsy and hippocampal sclerosis (Miller-Delaney2014Differential). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of GRID2IP in various neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders.

## Interactions
GRID2IP, also known as Delphilin, is a protein that interacts with several other proteins, playing a significant role in synaptic organization and function. It interacts with the glutamate receptor δ2 (GluRδ2) through its PDZ domain, a common feature in synaptic scaffolding proteins. This interaction is crucial for synaptic plasticity in the cerebellum, although it is inhibited by the phosphorylation of GluRδ2 by PKA, a calcium-sensitive kinase (Kawabata2019Multiple).

GRID2IP also interacts with the endocytic adaptor protein AP-2 in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. This interaction is important for maintaining the stability of GRID2IP, as the absence of AP-2 leads to its decreased levels, suggesting that AP-2 may protect GRID2IP from proteasomal degradation. This interaction is vital for the regulation of synaptic organization at glutamatergic synapses (Tolve2024Endocytic).

Additionally, GRID2IP is involved in interactions with RSK1, a protein kinase. Phosphorylation of RSK1 affects its binding to GRID2IP, with phosphorylation mostly eliminating the interaction (Gógl2019Rewiring). These interactions highlight GRID2IP's role as a scaffold protein linking various signaling molecules and the actin cytoskeleton at synaptic sites.
