# SZRD1

## Overview
SZRD1 (SUZ RNA binding domain containing 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in RNA binding, which plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression and maintaining cellular homeostasis. The protein, categorized as an RNA-binding protein, is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it influences essential cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and stress response. SZRD1 is notably involved in the regulation of the p53 signaling pathway, contributing to tumor suppressor functions by mediating cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage (Zhang2015Expression). The gene has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, where alterations in its expression or mutations can significantly impact disease progression and prognosis (Gladitz2018Network-based; Dharshini2021Exploring).

## Function
SZRD1 (SUZ RNA binding domain containing 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in RNA binding, playing a significant role in regulating gene expression and maintaining cellular homeostasis. The protein is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it influences critical cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and stress response. In particular, SZRD1 has been identified as a regulator of the p53 signaling pathway, a crucial pathway for cell cycle control and tumor suppression. It increases the abundance of p53, a protein that mediates cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage, thereby contributing to its tumor suppressor functions (Zhang2015Expression).

In cancer contexts, SZRD1 has been reported to act as a potential tumor suppressor, particularly in cervical cancer, where it is involved in cell cycle arrest at the G2 phase and induction of apoptosis (Gladitz2018Network-based). Its underexpression in oligodendrogliomas compared to normal brain tissue suggests a role in tumor suppression in these cancers as well (Gladitz2018Network-based). These findings highlight SZRD1's involvement in critical pathways that regulate cell proliferation and survival, underscoring its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing tumorigenesis.

## Clinical Significance
The SZRD1 gene has been implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression or mutations. In neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), a variant of the SZRD1 gene [rs138678090 (C/T)] affects the binding of miRNA hsa-miR-301a-3p. This miRNA is downregulated in both AD and PD, leading to the upregulation of target genes like SUN2, NFIB, LRP4, and PHF20, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of these diseases (Dharshini2021Exploring).

In the context of cancer, SZRD1 is underexpressed in oligodendrogliomas, a type of brain tumor, suggesting a potential role in tumor suppression. Its underexpression may impact the growth of these tumors, indicating that SZRD1 could influence tumor behavior and prognosis (Gladitz2018Network-based). Additionally, in high-grade serous ovarian cancer, SZRD1 is upregulated in short-term survivors, suggesting that its expression levels may be associated with survival outcomes (Kotnik2023Genetic).

In gliomas, SZRD1 is negatively co-expressed with the lncRNA TRHDE-AS1, indicating a potential interaction that could influence tumor progression (Xie2023lncRNA). These findings highlight the clinical significance of SZRD1 in various diseases.

## Interactions
SZRD1 (SUZ RNA binding domain containing 1) is involved in several interactions that influence cellular processes. It contains a SUZ domain, which is a conserved RNA-binding domain, suggesting its role in binding to RNA molecules (Zhao2017SZRD1). SZRD1 has been shown to interact with key signaling pathways by modulating the phosphorylation status of proteins such as ERK1/2, AKT, and STAT3, which are part of the MAPK signaling pathway. This modulation results in the inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis (Zhao2017SZRD1).

The protein also interacts with the CDK inhibitor P21, leading to cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase (Zhao2017SZRD1). Additionally, SZRD1 is a target of miR-128, a microRNA that binds to its mRNA, suggesting a regulatory interaction that affects SZRD1's role in cell proliferation and apoptosis (Schreiber2023Identification).

In the context of phosphoproteomic analysis, SZRD1 has been identified with decreased phosphorylation in rat heart and aortic tissues after secoiridoid consumption, indicating its involvement in phosphorylation-dependent regulatory networks (Pedret2021Phosphoproteomic). These interactions highlight SZRD1's role in cellular signaling and regulatory mechanisms.
