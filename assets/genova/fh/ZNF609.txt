# ZNF609

## Overview
ZNF609 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 609, a transcription factor characterized by its C2H2-type zinc finger domains, which facilitate DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. This protein plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, differentiation, and development. ZNF609 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences the expression of target genes, thereby impacting cellular proliferation and organismal development. The gene is also notable for its involvement in the formation of circular RNA, circ-ZNF609, which acts as a molecular sponge for microRNAs, affecting gene expression in several pathological conditions, such as cancers and genetic disorders (Peng2016Circular; Rossi2019CircZNF609; Gu2021Circular).

## Structure
ZNF609 is a zinc finger protein characterized by the presence of C2H2-type zinc finger domains, which are crucial for its DNA-binding capability. These domains contribute to the protein's modular structure, allowing it to interact with specific DNA sequences. The protein's structure is likely influenced by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can modulate its activity and function. ZNF609 may exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which could result in variations in its functional roles. The presence of these splice variants suggests that ZNF609 might have diverse biological functions depending on the isoform expressed. The specific details of its primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not provided in the available context.

## Function
ZNF609, a zinc finger protein, functions as a transcription factor involved in regulating gene expression. It contains zinc finger motifs that enable it to bind DNA, influencing transcriptional activity. ZNF609 plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation, differentiation, and development. It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it modulates the expression of target genes, impacting various cellular processes and organismal development.

In healthy human cells, ZNF609 is involved in the regulation of the G1-S phase transition of the cell cycle, which is critical for cell proliferation. This regulatory function is particularly evident in contexts such as rhabdomyosarcoma, where ZNF609 influences the expression of genes associated with cell cycle progression (Rossi2019CircZNF609). The protein's activity in the nucleus allows it to directly affect the transcriptional status of its target genes, thereby playing a significant role in maintaining normal cellular functions and ensuring proper cell cycle progression.

ZNF609's involvement in these molecular processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and supporting normal developmental processes. Its regulatory functions are essential for the proper functioning of cells and the overall development of the organism.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ZNF609 gene, particularly in its circular RNA form, circ-ZNF609, have been implicated in several diseases. In Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR), a congenital digestive disorder, circ-ZNF609 is down-regulated in affected tissues. This down-regulation is associated with inhibited cell proliferation and migration, suggesting a role in the disease's pathogenesis. Circ-ZNF609 acts as a competitive endogenous RNA by sponging miR-150-5p, which regulates AKT3 expression, a gene involved in cell proliferation and differentiation (Peng2016Circular).

In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), circ-ZNF609 is up-regulated, promoting cancer cell growth by modulating the miR-188/ELF2 axis. Its knockdown results in reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (CircRNA; p&gt; Li2020&lt). Similarly, in renal cell carcinoma, circ-ZNF609 is elevated and contributes to tumor progression by sponging miR-138-5p, which affects FOXP4 expression (Huang2021Emerging; Xiong2018CircRNA).

In myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), circ-ZNF609 is significantly increased in skeletal muscles, correlating with muscle weakness. This suggests its potential as a biomarker for DM1 (Voellenkle2018Dysregulation).

## Interactions
ZNF609, a zinc finger protein, is involved in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation. It is part of the Integrator complex, specifically interacting with the INTS10-13-14 module. This interaction involves transcription factors such as ZNF608 and ZNF609, which are transcription repressors. These factors co-purify with the INTS10-13-14 module, indicating a direct binding to the INTS13-14 subcomplex through minimal INT binding motifs (IBM) (Sabath2024Mechanistic). ZNF609's interaction with the Integrator complex is characterized by its strand (s)IBM motif binding to the INTS13-14 complex, displaying the highest affinity among sIBM-containing proteins. This interaction involves a conserved hydrophobic pocket on INTS13 and a positive surface patch on INTS14, accommodating the negatively charged residues of ZNF609 (Sabath2024Mechanistic).

In addition to its role in transcriptional regulation, ZNF609 is involved in RNA processing. The circular RNA derived from ZNF609, known as circ-ZNF609, acts as a molecular sponge for various microRNAs, influencing gene expression in different cancers. For instance, in cervical cancer, circ-ZNF609 regulates E2F6 expression by sponging miR-197-3p (Gu2021Circular).
