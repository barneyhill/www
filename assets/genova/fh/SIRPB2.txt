# SIRPB2

## Overview
SIRPB2, or Signal Regulatory Protein Beta 2, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in immune cell signaling. This protein is predominantly expressed on myeloid cells and plays a significant role in modulating immune responses through cell-cell communication. The SIRPB2 protein is integral to processes such as phagocytosis and cytokine production, which are vital for maintaining tissue homeostasis and defending against infections. By influencing these processes, SIRPB2 ensures effective immune responses while preventing excessive inflammation that could result in tissue damage. The protein's localization to the cell membrane allows it to interact with other cell surface molecules, facilitating the transmission of signals necessary for regulating immune functions.

## Structure


## Function
SIRPB2, or Signal Regulatory Protein Beta 2, is a protein involved in immune cell signaling, primarily expressed on myeloid cells. It plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses by participating in cell-cell communication. This protein influences key processes such as phagocytosis, where it aids in the engulfment and digestion of cellular debris and pathogens, thereby maintaining tissue homeostasis and defense against infections. SIRPB2 also impacts cytokine production, which is essential for the regulation of immune responses and inflammation. Through these activities, SIRPB2 contributes to the overall function of the immune system, ensuring effective responses to pathogens while preventing excessive inflammation that could lead to tissue damage. The protein's activity is localized to the cell membrane, where it interacts with other cell surface molecules to transmit signals that regulate these immune processes.
