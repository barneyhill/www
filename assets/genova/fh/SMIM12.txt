# SMIM12

## Overview
SMIM12, or small integral membrane protein 12, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein, which suggests its involvement in cellular processes that occur across the cell membrane. While the specific functions of SMIM12 are not fully elucidated, transmembrane proteins typically play critical roles in signal transduction, transport, and cellular communication. The gene's expression and the protein's interactions may have implications in various biological pathways and could be significant in understanding certain clinical conditions. Further research is necessary to fully characterize the functional roles and potential clinical significance of SMIM12.
