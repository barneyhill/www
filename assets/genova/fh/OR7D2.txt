# OR7D2

## Overview
The OR7D2 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 7 subfamily D member 2, which is part of the olfactory receptor family, a group of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) involved in the detection of odor molecules. These receptors are characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is typical of many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors. OR7D2 is primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it plays a crucial role in the sense of smell by binding specific odorants and initiating a neuronal response. Beyond its role in olfaction, recent studies have suggested that OR7D2 may have additional functions in other tissues, including potential involvement in cancer biology and skin health, as indicated by its expression patterns and mutation profiles in various conditions (Kafita2023Shedding; Zhang2020Genomic; Kang2021UVIrradiation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the OR7D2 gene have been implicated in various conditions, although its specific clinical significance remains largely unexplored. In cancer research, OR7D2 has been identified as a dark gene associated with mixed responses to pathway inhibitors in cancer cell lines, particularly those with mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) pathway. This suggests that mutations in OR7D2 can lead to varied drug sensitivity outcomes, potentially informing targeted cancer therapies (Kafita2023Shedding).

In the context of skin health, OR7D2 expression is significantly upregulated in human keratinocytes under conditions of UV irradiation and inflammation. This upregulation is associated with inflammatory processes and may impact skin barrier function, indicating a potential role in skin barrier dysfunction (Kang2021UVIrradiation).

In colorectal cancer, OR7D2 is one of the most highly mutated genes in both primary tumors and metastases, although its exact role in disease progression and clinical outcomes remains unclear (Zhang2020Genomic).

Additionally, genomic structural variations, such as expansions upstream of OR7D2, have been observed in certain populations, suggesting potential population-specific changes in its expression and function (Soto2023Genomic).
