# GARS1

## Overview
GARS1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme glycyl-tRNA synthetase 1 (GlyRS), which is a crucial component of the protein synthesis machinery. GlyRS is classified as an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, a type of enzyme responsible for attaching specific amino acids to their corresponding tRNA molecules, a process essential for accurate translation of the genetic code into proteins. The enzyme operates in both the cytosol and mitochondria, ensuring the proper assembly of proteins by facilitating the charging of tRNA molecules with glycine (Markovitz2020GARS‐related). Structurally, GlyRS is a homodimer with distinct domains that include a catalytic domain and an anticodon-binding domain, which are vital for its function (Markovitz2020GARS‐related). Mutations in GARS1 have been implicated in several neuromuscular disorders, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2D and distal hereditary motor neuropathy, highlighting its importance in maintaining peripheral nerve function (Beijer2020The; Antonellis2003Glycyl).

## Structure
The GARS1 gene encodes the glycyl-tRNA synthetase, a crucial enzyme for protein synthesis that charges glycine onto its corresponding tRNA. The human GARS protein is composed of several distinct domains, including an N-terminal WHEP-TRS domain, a catalytic domain interspersed with three insertion domains, and a C-terminal anticodon-binding domain (Markovitz2020GARS‐related). These domains are essential for the enzyme's function in both the cytosol and mitochondria.

The primary structure of GARS1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form these functional domains. The secondary structure likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of many proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding necessary for its enzymatic activity, particularly in the catalytic and anticodon-binding domains, which are critical for its function (Markovitz2020GARS‐related).

Post-translational modifications, such as palmitoylation, play a significant role in the function of GARS1. Specifically, palmitoylation at the C390 residue is crucial for the secretion of GARS1 in extracellular vesicles, indicating its importance in cellular processes beyond protein synthesis (Goughnour2020Extracellular). The context does not provide information on quaternary structure or splice variant isoforms.

## Function
The GARS1 gene encodes glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS), an enzyme essential for protein synthesis. GlyRS catalyzes the attachment of glycine to its corresponding tRNA, a critical step in the translation process. This enzyme operates in both the cytosol and mitochondria, ensuring the proper assembly of proteins by facilitating the accurate charging of tRNA molecules with glycine (Markovitz2020GARS‐related). 

In healthy human cells, GlyRS functions as a homodimer, with each subunit playing distinct roles in binding tRNA. The enzyme's structure includes specific insertion sequences that regulate access to the catalytic pocket and support tRNA binding, which are crucial for its aminoacylation activity (Qin2014Cocrystal). GlyRS undergoes significant conformational changes during catalysis, which are necessary for its function in protein synthesis (Qin2014Cocrystal).

GlyRS is ubiquitously expressed and plays a global role in protein synthesis, particularly in tRNA charging. It is associated with granules in neuronal cells, suggesting a role in maintaining peripheral axons (Antonellis2006Functional). The enzyme's activity is vital for cellular processes and organismal development, impacting the maintenance of peripheral nerve axons (Antonellis2006Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GARS1 gene, which encodes glycyl-tRNA synthetase, are linked to several neuromuscular disorders, including Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2D (CMT2D), distal hereditary motor neuropathy type V (dHMN-V), and infantile spinal muscular atrophy (iSMA) (Markovitz2020GARS‐related; Beijer2020The; Antonellis2003Glycyl). These conditions are characterized by progressive motor and sensory neuropathies, often with a predominance in the upper limbs (Beijer2020The; Antonellis2003Glycyl).

GARS1 mutations are typically missense mutations that can lead to a loss of function or mislocalization of the protein, affecting its normal role in tRNA charging and protein synthesis (Antonellis2006Functional). Some mutations, such as E71G and P234KY, retain tRNA charging activity, suggesting alternative pathogenic mechanisms, such as tRNA Gly sequestration, which depletes the cellular tRNA Gly pool and disrupts protein synthesis (Beijer2020The; Mora2024GlycyltRNA).

In addition to neuropathies, GARS1 mutations have been associated with severe early-onset SMA-like symptoms, including respiratory distress and muscle weakness, expanding the clinical spectrum of GARS1-related diseases (Markovitz2020GARS‐related). These findings underscore the critical role of GARS1 in maintaining peripheral nerve function and highlight the diverse clinical manifestations resulting from its mutations.

## Interactions
Glycyl-tRNA synthetase 1 (GARS1) is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function and role in disease. GARS1 is secreted from macrophages in extracellular vesicles (EVs) and is anchored to these vesicles through a palmitoylated C390 residue. These GARS1-containing EVs (GARS1-EVs) have been shown to contain proteins such as the insulin-like growth factor II receptor and vimentin, which contribute to their anti-cancer activity (Goughnour2020Extracellular).

Mutant forms of GARS1, associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2D, exhibit increased binding to cytoskeletal proteins and receptors. These mutants co-immunoprecipitate with HDAC6, a deacetylase that affects tubulin stability, suggesting that mutant GARS1 enhances HDAC6 activity, disrupting mitochondrial transport. Mutant GARS1 also binds to neuropilin-1, interfering with its interaction with the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), and to TrkA, correlating with disease severity through increased Trk activation (1 page 10 of 31).

In cancer, GARS1 interacts with proteins involved in the neddylation pathway, which is significant in cancer progression. Fraisinib, a calixpyrrole derivative, inhibits GARS1, affecting its interactions and potentially suppressing UBE2F activity, which is involved in drug resistance (Ben2024Fraisinib:).
