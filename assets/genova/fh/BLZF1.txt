# BLZF1

## Overview
The BLZF1 gene encodes the basic leucine zipper nuclear factor 1, a nuclear protein that functions primarily as a transcription factor. This protein is characterized by a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain, which facilitates DNA binding and dimerization, essential for its role in transcriptional regulation (Huang2015BLZF1). BLZF1 is involved in various cellular processes, including epigenetic regulation and the Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway, through interactions with proteins such as DNMT3L (Huang2015BLZF1). The protein is ubiquitously expressed in both normal and tumor cells, indicating its fundamental role in cellular function (Tong2000Genomic). Additionally, BLZF1 interacts with mutant KIT proteins in gastrointestinal stromal tumors, highlighting its significance in oncogenic processes (Kwon2022Identification). The gene's expression is modulated in response to cellular signals, such as retinoid-induced maturation, further underscoring its involvement in cell differentiation and development (Tong2000Genomic).

## Structure
The BLZF1 protein, also known as JEM-1, is encoded by the BLZF1 gene located on human chromosome 1q24. It is a 45-kDa nuclear protein characterized by a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain, which is crucial for DNA binding and dimerization, suggesting its role as a transcription factor (Huang2015BLZF1). The protein structure includes a putative leucine repeat and a PEST motif, which is often associated with proteins that have a short intracellular half-life (Tong2000Genomic). The BLZF1 protein also contains several phosphorylation sites, indicating potential regulation through phosphorylation (Tong2000Genomic).

The BLZF1 gene produces a full-length transcript and a shorter splice variant, Jem-1s, which results from the extension of exon 3. This shorter variant encodes a 23-kDa protein that lacks the leucine repeat, PEST domain, and several terminal phosphorylation sites, leading to its cytoplasmic localization, unlike the nuclear localization of the full-length protein (Tong2000Genomic). The presence of a nuclear localization signal in the full-length protein supports its function in the nucleus, potentially as a transcription cofactor (Tong1999JEM1). The protein's expression is modulated in various cellular contexts, including upregulation during retinoid-induced maturation in leukemia cells (Tong2000Genomic).

## Function
The BLZF1 gene, also known as basic leucine zipper nuclear factor 1, encodes a 45-kDa nuclear protein involved in transcriptional regulation. It is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, including both normal and tumor cells, indicating its fundamental role in cellular processes (Tong2000Genomic). The protein contains a leucine zipper motif, a PEST motif, and several phosphorylation sites, which suggest its involvement in protein-protein interactions and regulation of protein stability (Tong2000Genomic).

BLZF1 functions as a transcription factor and is involved in epigenetic regulation and the Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway. It interacts with DNMT3L, a protein involved in DNA methylation, indicating a role in epigenetic modifications (Huang2015BLZF1). The protein is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it can activate AP-1, a transcription factor complex, through its C-terminus, influencing gene expression related to cell proliferation and differentiation (Tong2000Genomic; Huang2015BLZF1).

In HeLa cells, overexpression of BLZF1 leads to increased AP-1 activity, highlighting its role in transcriptional regulation (Tong2000Genomic). The gene's expression can be upregulated by retinoids, which are known to induce cell maturation and differentiation, suggesting its involvement in cellular development processes (Tong2000Genomic).

## Interactions
BLZF1, also known as basic leucine zipper nuclear factor 1, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. In the context of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), BLZF1 interacts with the mutant KIT protein (MT-KIT). This interaction is essential for the retention and stable expression of MT-KIT in the Golgi complex, which supports the growth of GIST cells (Kwon2022Identification; Kwon2023Identification). BLZF1's role in tethering MT-KIT to the Golgi complex allows MT-KIT to bypass the endoplasmic reticulum quality control, facilitating tumorigenic signaling (Kwon2023Identification).

BLZF1 also interacts with DNMT3L, a protein involved in DNA methylation. This interaction is specific to DNMT3L and does not extend to DNMT3A or DNMT3B, suggesting a unique role for BLZF1 in epigenetic regulation (Pacaud2014DNMT3L). In the context of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, BLZF1, also known as Zta, is a transcriptional activator that can be post-translationally modified by SUMO proteins. This modification affects its transcriptional activity by associating with HDAC3, leading to repression of BLZF1-induced genes (Mattoscio2013Viral).
