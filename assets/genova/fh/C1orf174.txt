# C1orf174

## Overview
C1orf174, also known as chromosome 1 open reading frame 174, is a gene located on chromosome 1 that encodes a protein of the same name. The protein encoded by C1orf174 is currently not well-characterized in terms of its specific biological function or classification into known protein categories such as kinases or receptors. Despite the limited understanding of its functional role, C1orf174 has been implicated in various genomic studies, suggesting potential involvement in several medical conditions. For instance, its proximity to differentially expressed piRNAs in Alzheimer's disease and its association with certain genetic markers in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer highlight its potential clinical relevance (Qiu2017Transcriptomewide; Galesloot2022Genomewide). However, the exact biological mechanisms and clinical implications of C1orf174 remain to be elucidated through further research.

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the C1orf174 gene is not fully understood, but it has been implicated in several conditions through its association with differentially expressed piRNAs and proximity to certain genetic markers. In Alzheimer's disease, C1orf174 is located near piRNAs that are differentially expressed, suggesting a potential link to the disease, although the specific clinical implications remain unclear (Qiu2017Transcriptomewide). In the context of oligodendroglial tumors, C1orf174, along with other genes, showed no detectable transcripts in some cases, indicating absent expression in certain tumors, but the clinical significance of this finding is not detailed (pang2010kiaa0495).

In non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, C1orf174 is mentioned as the nearest protein-coding gene to certain SNPs identified in a genome-wide meta-analysis, though its direct clinical significance in this context is not specified (Galesloot2022Genomewide). Overall, while C1orf174 is associated with various conditions through genomic studies, its precise role and clinical impact require further investigation.
