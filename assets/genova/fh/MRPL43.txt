# MRPL43

## Overview
The MRPL43 gene encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein L43, which is a component of the large 39S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome, or mitoribosome. This protein plays a pivotal role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by aiding in the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation, a key process in cellular ATP production (Smits2007Reconstructing; He2012Mitochondrial). MRPL43 is homologous to the B8 subunit of respiratory Complex I, indicating a shared evolutionary origin and potential involvement in mitochondrial respiratory function (Smits2007Reconstructing). The gene's expression is intricately regulated by a bidirectional promoter shared with the TWINKLE gene, suggesting a coordinated role in mitochondrial DNA replication and protein synthesis (Meersseman2014Bovine). Alterations in MRPL43 expression have been linked to various diseases, including colorectal cancer and Parkinson's disease, underscoring its clinical significance in mitochondrial function and disease pathogenesis (Zhu2020miR608; Billingsley2019Mitochondria).

## Structure


## Function
MRPL43 is a mitochondrial ribosomal protein that is part of the large 39S subunit of the mitoribosome. It plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into functional proteins, which are essential for oxidative phosphorylation, a critical process for ATP production in cells (Smits2007Reconstructing; He2012Mitochondrial). MRPL43 is homologous to the B8 subunit of respiratory Complex I (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase) of the oxidative phosphorylation system, suggesting a shared evolutionary origin and a potential role in mitochondrial respiratory function (Smits2007Reconstructing).

The protein is involved in the assembly and function of the mitoribosome, which is essential for mitochondrial translation and energy metabolism. MRPL43's presence in mitochondrial nucleoids indicates its involvement in the mitochondrial translation apparatus, linking it to the broader context of mitochondrial protein synthesis and cellular energy production (He2012Mitochondrial). The gene's expression is regulated by a bidirectional promoter shared with the TWINKLE gene, highlighting its synchronized expression and potential regulatory mechanisms in mitochondrial function (Meersseman2014Bovine).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MRPL43 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly colorectal cancer (CRC) and Parkinson's disease (PD). In CRC, MRPL43 expression is significantly increased in tumor tissues compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues. Functional experiments have demonstrated that knockdown of MRPL43 in CRC cell lines results in decreased cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, suggesting its role as an oncogene. This knockdown also leads to increased apoptosis and cell cycle changes, indicating that MRPL43 could be a potential target for therapeutic intervention in CRC (Zhu2020miR608; Bao2022Potential).

In the context of PD, MRPL43 is associated with mitochondrial function, and genetic variations within this gene have been linked to PD risk. MRPL43 is co-expressed with genes known to cause monogenic forms of PD, suggesting its involvement in PD-related pathways. The gene's role in mitochondrial processes may contribute to PD risk, highlighting the importance of mitochondrial dysfunction in the disease's pathogenesis (Billingsley2018Genetic; Billingsley2019Mitochondria).

Additionally, MRPL43 has been studied in relation to autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia (SPG45), where over-expression of its splice variants was detected in patients, although no direct mutations were identified (Dursun2009Autosomal).

## Interactions
MRPL43 is a component of the mitochondrial ribosome, specifically part of the large 39S subunit, and is involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis. It is associated with mitochondrial nucleoids, which are complexes that include various mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, indicating a connection between MRPL43 and the mitochondrial translation apparatus (He2012Mitochondrial). MRPL43 is homologous to the B8 subunit of respiratory Complex I (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase) of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system, suggesting a potential interaction or functional relationship with components of the respiratory chain (Smits2007Reconstructing). 

The gene encoding MRPL43 is regulated by a bidirectional promoter shared with the TWINKLE gene, a mitochondrial DNA helicase, which suggests a coordinated regulation of mitochondrial DNA replication and protein synthesis (Meersseman2014Bovine). This regulatory mechanism involves several transcription factors, such as Sp1, Ets, and E2F4, which may influence the expression of MRPL43, although direct protein interactions are not detailed (Meersseman2014Bovine). The interactions of MRPL43 within the mitochondrial ribosome and its potential involvement with respiratory complexes highlight its critical role in mitochondrial function and energy production.
