# PCSK1

## Overview
The PCSK1 gene encodes the enzyme proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 (PC1/3), a serine protease that plays a pivotal role in the proteolytic processing of prohormones and neuropeptides. This enzyme is categorized as a calcium-dependent serine endoprotease and is primarily active in the secretory pathways of neuroendocrine and endocrine cells, such as those in the hypothalamus, pituitary, and pancreatic islets. PC1/3 is essential for converting various hormone precursors into their active forms, thereby regulating critical physiological processes including metabolism, growth, and appetite. Mutations in the PCSK1 gene can lead to significant metabolic disorders, such as obesity and hypoadrenalism, due to impaired hormone processing. The enzyme's activity is modulated by interactions with other proteins and is subject to genetic variations that can influence its function and stability (Pickett2013Functional; Seidah2012The; Stijnen2016Endoplasmic).

## Structure
The PCSK1 gene encodes the proprotein convertase 1/3 (PC1/3), a serine protease involved in the proteolytic processing of prohormones and neuropeptides. The primary structure of PC1/3 consists of 753 amino acids, organized into several distinct domains: a signal peptide (1-27), a prodomain (28-110), a catalytic domain (111-459), a P domain (460-597), and a carboxyl-terminal domain (598-753) (DuclauxLoras2021A). The catalytic domain is highly conserved and forms a catalytic triad with the amino acids Asp, His, and Ser, which are crucial for its enzymatic function (DuclauxLoras2021A; Demoures2018PCSK1).

The secondary structure of PC1/3 includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which contribute to the enzyme's stability and function. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a functional enzyme, essential for its activity. The P domain regulates PCSK1 activity through calcium and pH modulation, while the carboxy-terminal domain is involved in sorting PCSK1 into secretory granules (Demoures2018PCSK1).

PC1/3 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and phosphorylation, which are common in serine proteases and contribute to its stability and activity. Splice variants of PCSK1 can result in different isoforms with distinct functional properties (Demoures2018PCSK1).

## Function
The PCSK1 gene encodes the enzyme proprotein convertase 1/3 (PC1/3), a calcium-dependent serine endoprotease crucial for converting various prohormones and neuropeptide precursors into their bioactive forms. PC1/3 is primarily active in the secretory pathway of neuroendocrine and endocrine cells, including the hypothalamus, pituitary, and pancreatic islets (Pickett2013Functional; Stijnen2016Endoplasmic). It processes substrates such as proinsulin, proglucagon, and proghrelin, which are essential for nutrient absorption, metabolism, and appetite regulation (Pickett2013Functional).

PC1/3 is involved in the cleavage of hormone precursors like growth hormone-releasing hormone, pro-opiomelanocortin, and intestinal proglucagon, which are vital for normal growth, development, and glucose homeostasis (Seidah2012The). The enzyme's activity is regulated by its autocatalytic cleavage and is influenced by genetic variants, some of which are associated with obesity and diabetes (Pickett2013Functional; Stijnen2016Endoplasmic).

Mutations in PCSK1 can lead to impaired processing of these substrates, resulting in metabolic imbalances and conditions such as obesity, hyperphagia, and hypoadrenalism (Pickett2013Functional; Stijnen2016Endoplasmic). The enzyme's proper function is critical for maintaining normal physiological processes and energy homeostasis in healthy human cells (Seidah2012The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PCSK1 gene, which encodes the enzyme proprotein convertase 1/3 (PC1/3), are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily due to the enzyme's role in processing prohormones into active hormones. Congenital proprotein convertase 1/3 deficiency is a notable condition resulting from PCSK1 mutations. This autosomal recessive disorder is characterized by severe malabsorptive diarrhea, early-onset obesity, and a range of endocrinopathies, including growth hormone deficiency, diabetes insipidus, hypogonadism, adrenal insufficiency, and hypothyroidism (Martín2013Congenital; Aerts2021Novel; Wilschanski2014A).

The deficiency often presents in infancy with life-threatening diarrhea and failure to thrive, necessitating prolonged parenteral nutrition. As affected individuals age, they may experience significant weight gain and obesity due to impaired hormone processing, particularly involving the leptin-melanocortin receptor 4 pathway (Martín2013Congenital; RamosMolina2016PCSK1). PCSK1 mutations can also lead to impaired maturation and secretion of PC1/3 proteins, affecting appetite and energy metabolism, and increasing the risk of obesity (RamosMolina2016PCSK1).

In some cases, specific mutations like p.Arg80* have been linked to dominantly inherited obesity, highlighting the gene's role in metabolic regulation (Philippe2014A). The clinical manifestations of PCSK1 mutations underscore the enzyme's critical function in endocrine and metabolic pathways.

## Interactions
PCSK1, encoding the proprotein convertase 1/3 (PC1/3), is involved in several protein interactions that influence its activity and stability. One significant interaction is with proSAAS, a 30 kDa binding protein found in neural and endocrine tissues. ProSAAS acts as a nanomolar inhibitor of active PC1/3, with its C-terminal 41-residue peptide containing an inhibitory sequence for PC1/3. This interaction suggests that proSAAS is an endogenous inhibitor of PC1/3, blocking its enzymatic activity at early stages of the regulated secretory pathway (RamosMolina2016PCSK1; Stijnen2016PCSK1).

Mutations in PCSK1 can also affect its interactions. For instance, the p.Arg80* mutation in PCSK1 leads to a loss of function in the PC1/3 protein. The mutant propeptide fragment (PCSK1-p.Arg80*) inhibits the wild-type PC1/3 enzyme by 20%, similar to the inhibition caused by the PCSK1-p.Arg110* mutation. This inhibition does not involve a strong physical interaction, as no co-immunoprecipitation was observed between the mutant propeptide fragment and wild-type PC1/3 (Philippe2014A).

PC1/3 also interacts with the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone BiP, particularly in the context of mutations like PC1/3-N222D, which suggest impaired folding and reduced stability. This interaction is observed in several human obesity-associated PC1/3 variants, indicating a common mechanism of misfolding and retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (Stijnen2016Endoplasmic).
