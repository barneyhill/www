# SIRT1

## Overview
SIRT1 is a gene that encodes the protein sirtuin 1, a member of the sirtuin family of proteins, which are NAD+-dependent deacetylases. Sirtuin 1 plays a pivotal role in regulating various cellular processes, including chromatin remodeling, transcriptional regulation, and metabolic homeostasis. It is primarily located in the nucleus, where it deacetylates histones and non-histone proteins, thereby influencing gene expression and cellular stress responses (Michan2007Sirtuins; Michishita2005Evolutionarily). Sirtuin 1 is involved in critical pathways related to aging, metabolism, and DNA repair, acting as a key regulator of cellular senescence and genomic stability (Haigis2010Mammalian; Michan2007Sirtuins). The protein's activity is modulated by various post-translational modifications, which affect its interactions with other proteins and its functional outcomes (Luna2013SIRT1PARP1). SIRT1's involvement in numerous physiological and pathological processes underscores its significance in maintaining cellular and organismal health.

## Structure
SIRT1 (sirtuin 1) is a NAD+-dependent deacetylase with a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of SIRT1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, which includes several domains crucial for its function. The secondary structure features a Rossmann fold, which is essential for NAD+ binding, and a zinc-binding small lobe (Cao2015Structural; Dai2015Crystallographic).

The tertiary structure of SIRT1 is characterized by a conserved catalytic core, which includes a large Rossmann-fold lobe and a smaller zinc-binding lobe. This core is responsible for the enzyme's deacetylase activity (Autiero2009Human; Dai2015Crystallographic). The N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal regulatory segment (CTR) are also significant, with the NTD serving as an allosteric site and interacting with activators like AROS and resveratrol (Cao2015Structural; Manjula2021SIRT1).

SIRT1's structure allows for various post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can regulate its activity. The protein's unordered regions, particularly at the N- and C-termini, contribute to its flexibility and ability to interact with multiple partners (Autiero2009Human). These structural features enable SIRT1 to play a role in diverse cellular processes, including chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation (Autiero2009Human).

## Function
SIRT1, a member of the sirtuin family, is a NAD+-dependent deacetylase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it deacetylates histones and non-histone proteins, influencing chromatin structure and gene expression (Michan2007Sirtuins; Michishita2005Evolutionarily). SIRT1 regulates transcription by deacetylating transcription factors such as p53, FOXO, and NF-κB, impacting processes like stress resistance, apoptosis, and inflammation (Michan2007Sirtuins; Michishita2005Evolutionarily).

SIRT1 is involved in metabolic regulation by modulating pathways related to glucose and lipid metabolism. It enhances insulin sensitivity and secretion, promotes fatty acid oxidation, and influences mitochondrial biogenesis through interactions with PGC-1α (Michan2007Sirtuins; Haigis2010Mammalian). SIRT1 also plays a role in cellular aging and senescence, where it can inhibit or promote senescence depending on the context (Michan2007Sirtuins).

In addition to its role in metabolism and aging, SIRT1 contributes to DNA repair and genomic stability, acting as a tumor suppressor by promoting apoptosis and inhibiting oncogenic factors (Haigis2010Mammalian). These functions highlight SIRT1's importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SIRT1 gene are associated with various diseases. In cardiovascular diseases, specific polymorphisms such as rs7069102 and rs2273773 have been linked to increased risk, with the GG genotype and G allele of rs7069102 and the TT genotype and T allele of rs2273773 being more prevalent in patients. These polymorphisms are associated with increased SIRT1 protein expression and oxidative stress markers, while eNOS protein levels are lower in affected individuals (Kilic2014SIRT1).

In neurodegenerative diseases, SIRT1 plays a protective role. Its expression is reduced in conditions like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, where it helps prevent amyloid-beta and tau pathology and inhibits alpha-synuclein aggregation. Despite increased SIRT1 levels in these diseases, its activity may decrease due to oxidative stress and inflammation (Elibol2018High; Donmez2013SIRT1).

SIRT1 is also involved in metabolic disorders. It acts as a "Master Metabolic Regulator," influencing glucose homeostasis, fat metabolism, and insulin sensitivity. Alterations in SIRT1 expression can lead to obesity and related metabolic conditions, with increased expression offering protection against lipid-induced inflammation and hepatic steatosis (Elibol2018High).

## Interactions
SIRT1, a member of the sirtuin family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. It interacts with several nuclear factors, including histone proteins, p53, NF-kB, FOXO, and Ku70, primarily through deacetylation, which affects their stability and localization (Law2009Identification). SIRT1 deacetylates p53, impacting its role in cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis, and interacts with the WRN protein, enhancing its helicase and exonuclease activities, which may contribute to anti-aging effects (Law2009Identification).

SIRT1 also forms part of the mSIN3A/HDAC1 complex, interacting with the RBP1 family of proteins and potentially regulating transcriptional repression by deacetylating HDAC1 (Binda2008SIRT1). It is associated with the NCOR and SMRT corepressor complexes, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation (Binda2008SIRT1).

SIRT1 interacts with NQO1, an NADH oxidoreductase, which supports SIRT1's function during mitochondrial stress. This interaction is enhanced under conditions of mitochondrial inhibition, indicating a regulatory loop between SIRT1 and NQO1 (Tsvetkov2021NQO1). SIRT1's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, methylation, and sumoylation, which influence its interactions and deacetylation activity (Luna2013SIRT1PARP1).
