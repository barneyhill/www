# POLR3A

## Overview
The POLR3A gene encodes the largest subunit of RNA polymerase III, a multi-subunit enzyme complex responsible for the transcription of small non-coding RNAs, including transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and 5S ribosomal RNA (rRNA). These RNAs are crucial for protein synthesis and other cellular processes. The protein encoded by POLR3A, RNA polymerase III subunit A, is integral to the assembly and function of the RNA polymerase III complex, interacting with other subunits to form a stable transcription initiation complex. This subunit is essential for the transcription of nuclear-encoded tRNA genes and small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), playing a significant role in RNA processing and modification. Mutations in POLR3A are linked to several neurodegenerative disorders, such as hypomyelinating leukodystrophy and 4H leukodystrophy, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular and neurological functions (Azmanov2016Transcriptomewide; Daoud2013Mutations; Choquet2019Leukodystrophyassociated).

## Function
The POLR3A gene encodes a subunit of RNA polymerase III (Pol III), which is crucial for the transcription of small non-coding RNAs, including transfer RNAs (tRNAs), 5S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and other regulatory RNAs such as BC200 and 7SL RNA. These RNAs are essential for various cellular processes, including protein synthesis, RNA processing, and transcription regulation (Azmanov2016Transcriptomewide; Choquet2019Leukodystrophyassociated).

In healthy human cells, POLR3A plays a vital role in the transcription of nuclear-encoded tRNA genes, which are necessary for translating mRNA into proteins. This process is critical for maintaining normal cellular function and growth (Choquet2019Leukodystrophyassociated). POLR3A is also involved in the transcription of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), which are important for RNA splicing and modification (Azmanov2016Transcriptomewide).

The activity of POLR3A is primarily located in the nucleoplasm, where it facilitates the transcription of essential components for ribosome function and protein translation. This transcriptional activity is crucial for the proper functioning of rapidly dividing cells, such as T cells, and plays a role in immune responses by generating tRNA-derived fragments that modulate translation and mRNA stabilization (Kessler2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the POLR3A gene are associated with several neurodegenerative disorders, primarily affecting the central nervous system. One of the most notable conditions linked to POLR3A mutations is hypomyelinating leukodystrophy, characterized by deficient myelination in the CNS. This disorder often presents with motor regression, cerebellar features, cognitive dysfunction, dental abnormalities, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (Daoud2013Mutations; Wolf2014Clinical). 

POLR3A mutations are also implicated in 4H leukodystrophy, a progressive disorder with symptoms such as developmental delays, ataxia, and gaze abnormalities. Patients with POLR3A mutations tend to experience more severe disease progression compared to those with POLR3B mutations (Wolf2014Clinical). 

Additionally, specific POLR3A mutations have been identified as a frequent cause of spastic ataxia, a condition characterized by hereditary spastic paraplegia, cerebellar ataxia, and neuropathy (Minnerop2017Hypomorphic). 

A novel phenotype termed Neurodevelopmental Disorder with Regression, Abnormal Movements, and Increased Lactate has been associated with specific POLR3A mutations, highlighting the gene's role in diverse neurological conditions (Zanette2020Neurodevelopmental). 

These findings underscore the clinical significance of POLR3A mutations in various neurodegenerative disorders, with specific mutations leading to distinct phenotypes.

## Interactions
POLR3A, a subunit of RNA polymerase III, plays a crucial role in the transcription of small non-coding RNAs. It interacts with several other subunits within the RNA polymerase III complex, including POLR3B, POLR2E, POLR3K, and POLR3B, forming a stable transcription initiation complex. These interactions are mediated through hydrogen bonds, salt-bridges, and other intermolecular forces, which are essential for the structural integrity and function of the polymerase complex (Paolacci2018Specific).

The C-terminal portion of POLR3A is particularly important for its interactions with other subunits. Specific residues such as Gly 903, Asp 1292, Arg 1069, Lys 1131, and Gly 1335 are critical for these interactions, and mutations at these sites can disrupt the stability and function of the complex (Paolacci2018Specific). Additionally, the last 200 C-terminal amino acids of POLR3A are crucial for interactions with subunits like C128 and C11, which are necessary for the catalytic activity of RNA polymerase III (Temel2020Unique).

POLR3A also interacts with nucleic acids during transcription. Structural studies have shown that POLR3A, along with other core subunits, binds to nucleic acids, facilitating the transcription process (Girbig2020CryoEM). These interactions are vital for the proper synthesis of tRNAs and other small RNAs.
