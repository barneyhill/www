# CACNG6

## Overview
The CACNG6 gene encodes the calcium voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit gamma 6, a transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in modulating the function of voltage-gated calcium channels. These channels are essential for the regulation of calcium ion flow across cell membranes, which is vital for various physiological processes, including muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, and gene expression. The gamma subunit, such as the one encoded by CACNG6, is part of a larger complex that influences the trafficking and gating properties of the calcium channels, thereby affecting their activity and stability. The CACNG6 gene is expressed in various tissues, and its protein product is involved in fine-tuning the electrical signaling in excitable cells, contributing to the precise control of calcium-dependent cellular functions (Guan2016Evaluation; Lee2010Association).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the CACNG6 gene have been associated with certain clinical conditions. In a Korean population, specific polymorphisms in CACNG6, particularly the SNP rs192808C > T, have been linked to an increased risk of aspirin-intolerant asthma (AIA). This SNP was found to be significantly more frequent in AIA patients compared to aspirin-tolerant asthma controls, with an odds ratio of 2.88 in a co-dominant model and 2.99 in a dominant model. The study also identified a haplotype, CACNG6_BL1_ht6, which includes the rare T variant of rs192808, as being significantly associated with AIA risk. These genetic variations may influence calcium ion regulation and leukotriene production, contributing to airway inflammation and bronchoconstriction in AIA (Lee2010Association).

In the context of neurological disorders, CACNG6 has been implicated in schizophrenia (SCZ). An epistasis analysis revealed a significant interaction between SNP rs192808 in CACNG6 and rs2048137 in CACNG5, suggesting a potential biological interaction that may contribute to SCZ susceptibility. However, no direct evidence links CACNG6 alone to SCZ, and its role may be part of a broader interaction with other genes in the calcium channel family (Guan2016Evaluation).
