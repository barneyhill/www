# CSTL1

## Overview
CSTL1 is a gene that encodes the protein cystatin-like 1, which is a member of the cystatin superfamily. This superfamily is characterized by its role in inhibiting cysteine proteases, enzymes that degrade proteins by cleaving peptide bonds. Cystatin-like 1 is involved in various biological processes, including cellular homeostasis and immune response regulation. The protein's structure and function suggest it may play a role in modulating protease activity, although its specific interactions and pathways remain to be fully elucidated. Understanding the precise biological functions and interactions of cystatin-like 1 is crucial for determining its potential implications in health and disease.
