# GEMIN2

## Overview
GEMIN2 is a gene that encodes the gem nuclear organelle associated protein 2, a crucial component of the survival motor neuron (SMN) complex. This protein plays a significant role in the assembly of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), which are essential for pre-mRNA splicing, a critical process for gene expression and cellular function. GEMIN2 is characterized as a structural protein that interacts with various components of the SMN complex, including SMN and Sm proteins, facilitating the assembly and function of spliceosomes (Zhang2019Structural; Kour2021Loss). The protein's interactions and regulatory roles extend to alternative splicing events, particularly under different temperature conditions, impacting circadian rhythms and temperature adaptation (Schlaen2015The). Mutations or dysregulation of GEMIN2 can lead to significant clinical implications, including neurodegenerative diseases such as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), highlighting its importance in maintaining motor neuron health (Cauchi2010SMN; Borg2015Genetic).

## Structure
GEMIN2 is a protein that plays a crucial role in the assembly of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) as part of the SMN complex. The molecular structure of GEMIN2 includes two major domains: the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the C-terminal domain (CTD). The NTD interacts with Sm proteins through a 'zipper' mechanism involving hydrogen bonding, while the CTD is a helical bundle consisting of seven α-helices and a 3_10-helix. The 3_10-helix is stabilized by conserved salt bridges and hydrogen bonds, particularly involving the QxDL motif, which is highly conserved across various eukaryotic species (Zhang2019Structural).

The CTD of GEMIN2 interacts with SmD1 and SmD2 proteins, primarily through hydrogen bonds, involving specific regions such as the N-terminal parts of α5 and α7 and the loop between α6-α7. The sequence of this loop is not conserved, but its length suggests structural rigidity (Zhang2019Structural). GEMIN2's interactions with Sm proteins are characterized by hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions, which are critical for the assembly of the Sm core (Zhang2019Structural).

GEMIN2 is also a phosphorylation substrate of the p70S6 kinase, with phosphorylation at serine 81 influencing its function within the SMN complex, although it does not affect the binding of GEMIN2 to the SMN core complex (Esser2023The).

## Function
GEMIN2 is a critical component of the survival motor neuron (SMN) complex, which is essential for the assembly of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) involved in pre-mRNA splicing. This process is crucial for the proper expression of genes and the maintenance of cellular function. GEMIN2 interacts directly with SMN proteins, facilitating the assembly of spliceosomes by binding to SMN and Sm heptameric rings, which are necessary for snRNP biogenesis (Kour2021Loss). The interaction between GEMIN2 and SMN is vital for the formation of the SMN complex, and disruptions in this interaction can lead to defects in snRNP assembly, which are associated with motor neuron degeneration (Kour2021Loss).

In addition to its role in snRNP assembly, GEMIN2 is involved in the regulation of alternative splicing events, particularly under varying temperature conditions. It modulates the effects of temperature on the alternative splicing of core clock genes, which are important for maintaining circadian rhythms (Schlaen2015The). GEMIN2's function in spliceosome assembly and alternative splicing highlights its importance in cellular processes and organismal outcomes, such as temperature adaptation and circadian rhythm regulation (Schlaen2015The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or dysregulation in the GEMIN2 gene can have significant clinical implications, particularly in relation to neurodegenerative diseases. GEMIN2 is a critical component of the SMN-Gemins complex, which is essential for the assembly of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). Disruptions in this complex, especially involving GEMIN2, can lead to motor defects and potentially contribute to conditions like spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) (Borg2015Genetic). SMA is a severe neuromuscular disorder characterized by the degeneration of motor neurons and muscle wasting, linked to insufficient levels of the SMN protein, with which GEMIN2 interacts (Cauchi2010SMN).

Overexpression of GEMIN2 has been shown to be toxic to cell viability, as it can cause the retention of Sm proteins in the cytoplasm, blocking snRNP assembly. This toxicity is observed in both Drosophila and S. pombe, indicating a conserved mechanism that may contribute to neurodegenerative conditions (Borg2015Genetic). In Drosophila, overexpression of GEMIN2 in muscle tissues leads to motor defects and reduced viability, further supporting its role in motor system health (Borg2015Genetic).

## Interactions
GEMIN2 is a key component of the survival of motor neuron (SMN) complex, which is essential for the assembly of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). GEMIN2 predominantly binds to SMN, as demonstrated in vitro using GST-tagged recombinant proteins. When GEMIN2 is used as bait, it binds exclusively to SMN, indicating a strong interaction between these two proteins (Otter2007A). GEMIN2 also interacts with other components of the SMN complex, including Gemin3, Gemin4, and Gemin5, and plays a crucial role in tethering Gemin5 to the complex. Reducing GEMIN2 levels results in a decreased association of SMN with Gemin5, highlighting its importance in maintaining the structural integrity of the complex (Otter2007A).

In the assembly of Sm-class snRNPs, GEMIN2 interacts with the SmD1/D2/F/E/G (5Sm) complex. It acts as a checkpoint, preventing non-cognate RNA and SmD3/B from joining the assembly. GEMIN2 binds the 5Sm complex from the peripheral side, allowing RNA entry, and its release is triggered by the binding of cognate RNA, which leads to the recruitment of SmD3/B (Zhang2019Structural). These interactions are crucial for the specificity of RNA assembly in the Sm core assembly pathway (Zhang2019Structural).
