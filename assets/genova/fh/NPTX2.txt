# NPTX2

## Overview
NPTX2 is a gene that encodes the protein neuronal pentraxin 2, which is a member of the pentraxin family of proteins. Neuronal pentraxin 2 is primarily involved in synaptic function and plasticity within the central nervous system. It plays a critical role in the regulation of excitatory synapses, particularly those containing AMPA receptors, by stabilizing these receptors at the postsynaptic membrane. This stabilization is essential for modulating synaptic transmission and plasticity, which are crucial for cognitive functions such as working memory (Gómez2021Neuronal; Pelkey2015Pentraxins). Additionally, neuronal pentraxin 2 is involved in the regulation of the complement system in the brain, protecting synapses from microglia-mediated elimination, which is significant in preventing neurodegenerative diseases (Zhou2022Neuronal). Beyond its neurological roles, NPTX2 has been implicated in various diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and certain cancers, highlighting its importance in both neural and pathological contexts (Moran2007Neuronal; Xiao2017NPTX2; Zhang2012Neuronal).

## Structure


## Function
Neuronal pentraxin 2 (NPTX2) is a protein that plays a crucial role in synaptic function and plasticity in the central nervous system. It is primarily involved in the regulation of excitatory synapses, particularly those containing AMPA receptors (AMPARs). NPTX2 is secreted from the presynaptic terminal and forms complexes with other neuronal pentraxins, such as NPTX1, to stabilize AMPARs at the postsynaptic membrane, thereby modulating synaptic transmission and plasticity (Gómez2021Neuronal).

NPTX2 is expressed as an immediate early gene in response to neuronal activity and is involved in the activity-dependent accumulation of GluA4-containing AMPARs, which is essential for the synaptic recruitment of parvalbumin fast-spiking interneurons (PVFSIs) (Pelkey2015Pentraxins). This regulation is critical for maintaining the balance between excitation and inhibition in neural circuits, which is necessary for proper cognitive functions such as working memory (Pelkey2015Pentraxins).

In addition to its role in synaptic plasticity, NPTX2 also regulates complement activity in the brain by binding to complement component C1q, thereby inhibiting the classical complement pathway and protecting synapses from microglia-mediated elimination (Zhou2022Neuronal). This function is important for maintaining synaptic integrity and preventing excessive synapse elimination, which is associated with neurodegenerative diseases (Zhou2022Neuronal).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NPTX2 gene have been implicated in several neurological disorders. In Parkinson's disease (PD), NPTX2 is significantly upregulated in the substantia nigra, where it is a novel component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. This upregulation is associated with the selective non-apoptotic cell death of dopaminergic neurons, a hallmark of PD, and may contribute to the disease's pathology (Moran2007Neuronal).

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), NPTX2 expression is downregulated, correlating with cognitive decline and hippocampal atrophy. This reduction disrupts the pyramidal neuron-parvalbumin interneuron microcircuit, contributing to cognitive dysfunction. NPTX2 levels in cerebrospinal fluid are also decreased in AD patients, serving as a potential biomarker for disease progression (Gómez2021Neuronal; Xiao2017NPTX2).

NPTX2 is also involved in frontotemporal dementia (FTD), where its levels decrease as the disease progresses, correlating with cognitive decline and grey matter volume reduction. This suggests its potential as a biomarker for monitoring disease progression (van2020Neuronal).

In pancreatic cancer, NPTX2 is frequently downregulated due to promoter hypermethylation, implicating it in the disease's pathogenesis (Zhang2012Neuronal).

## Interactions
Neuronal pentraxin 2 (NPTX2) is involved in several protein interactions that play critical roles in synaptic function and disease processes. NPTX2 physically interacts with frizzled class receptor 6 (FZD6) in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells, promoting the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This interaction enhances CRC cell proliferation and metastasis by facilitating β-catenin translocation into the nucleus and increasing the expression of downstream target genes such as MYC and cyclin D1 (Xu2019NPTX2).

In the context of synaptic plasticity, NPTX2 binds to AMPA receptors, particularly influencing their clustering and synaptic localization. This interaction is crucial for the maturation and integration of excitatory synapses, especially on parvalbumin interneurons (Pelkey2015Pentraxins; Xiao2017NPTX2). NPTX2 also forms complexes with the complement component C1q, acting as a decoy receptor to inhibit complement cascade activity, which is significant in preventing synapse loss in neurodegenerative diseases (Zhou2022Neuronal). These interactions highlight NPTX2's multifaceted role in both cancer progression and synaptic regulation.
