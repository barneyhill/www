# BLACAT1

## Overview
BLACAT1, or Bladder Cancer Associated Transcript 1, is a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) that has garnered significant attention due to its involvement in various cancer-related processes. Unlike protein-coding genes, BLACAT1 does not encode a protein but instead functions through its RNA product, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression and cellular pathways. The BLACAT1 gene is known for its interactions with key molecular components, such as the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), and its ability to act as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA), influencing the expression of multiple microRNAs (miRNAs) and their target genes. These interactions are pivotal in modulating cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and resistance to chemotherapy across different cancer types, including colorectal, lung, gastric, and breast cancers (Han2020Oncogenic; Su2017Long; Wu2018Long). The dysregulation of BLACAT1 is often associated with poor prognosis and advanced disease stages, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology (p&gt; Long; Ye2020&lt; Chen2018BLACAT1).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
BLACAT1 is a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) that plays a significant role in various cancers by influencing tumor progression, metastasis, and patient prognosis. In small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), BLACAT1 is overexpressed and associated with advanced clinical stages, larger tumor sizes, and metastasis, serving as an independent poor prognostic factor (Chen2018BLACAT1). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), BLACAT1 is linked to smoking status, lymph node metastasis, and chemotherapy resistance, particularly affecting autophagy-related pathways (Huang2018LncRNA; p&gt; Long; Ye2020&lt).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), BLACAT1 is upregulated and correlates with advanced cancer stages and poor survival. Its knockdown reduces cell proliferation and invasion, suggesting its role in promoting tumorigenesis (Bu2019Overexpression; p&gt; Long; Ye2020&lt). In breast cancer, BLACAT1 contributes to tamoxifen resistance by acting as a competing endogenous RNA for miR-503, leading to increased Bcl-2 expression and reduced apoptosis (p&gt; Long; Qu2020&lt).

BLACAT1 is also implicated in other cancers, such as cervical, gastric, and osteosarcoma, where it is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to therapies, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Han2020Oncogenic; p&gt; Long; Ye2020&lt).

## Interactions
BLACAT1, a long non-coding RNA, engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cancer progression. It interacts with the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), specifically binding to the EZH2 and SUZ12 components, to epigenetically silence the p15 gene in colorectal cancer. This interaction is crucial for transcriptional suppression and cell cycle regulation (Su2017Long).

In osteosarcoma, BLACAT1 activates STAT3 signaling, which is essential for malignancy, and functions as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) by binding to shared microRNAs (miRNAs), such as miR-605-3p, miR-503, and miR-150-5p, affecting gene expression (Han2020Oncogenic). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), BLACAT1 acts as a 'sponge' for miR-144, modulating cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Ye2017Long). It also interacts with miR-17 and ATG7, promoting autophagy and chemoresistance in NSCLC cells (Huang2018LncRNA).

In gastric cancer, BLACAT1 modulates oxaliplatin resistance by interacting with miR-361 and influencing the expression of ABCB1 and other drug resistance-related proteins (Wu2018Long). These interactions highlight BLACAT1's role in regulating gene expression and signaling pathways across various cancer types.
