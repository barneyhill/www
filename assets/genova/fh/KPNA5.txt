# KPNA5

## Overview
KPNA5, or karyopherin subunit alpha 5, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the importin alpha family, which is integral to the nuclear transport system in eukaryotic cells. The protein, karyopherin subunit alpha 5, functions as an adaptor in the nuclear import pathway, recognizing and binding nuclear localization signals (NLS) on cargo proteins. This interaction facilitates the formation of a complex with importin beta, enabling the translocation of proteins through the nuclear pore complex into the nucleus (OKA2018Importin). The protein's structure is characterized by an N-terminal importin beta-binding domain and multiple armadillo (ARM) repeats, which are crucial for its binding capabilities. KPNA5 is involved in the transport of essential nuclear proteins, such as transcription factors and DNA repair factors, and plays a significant role in cellular processes like gene expression and cell cycle regulation (OKA2018Importin). Additionally, KPNA5 has been implicated in various cellular interactions and may influence immune responses and tumor growth, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Liu2022Mammalian).

## Structure
KPNA5, or karyopherin subunit alpha 5, is a protein involved in nuclear transport and is a member of the importin alpha family. The protein structure of KPNA5 includes an N-terminal importin beta-binding (IBB) domain, which is crucial for its interaction with importin beta. This domain is followed by multiple armadillo (ARM) repeats, which form a helical structure. These ARM repeats are essential for binding to nuclear localization signals (NLS) on cargo proteins, facilitating their transport into the nucleus.

The presence of ARM repeats in KPNA5 contributes to its ability to recognize and bind specific NLS sequences, a key feature of its function in nuclear import. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate the activity and function of KPNA5, although specific sites and effects of these modifications are not detailed in the provided context.

KPNA5 may also exist in different splice variant isoforms, which could contribute to its functional diversity. These isoforms may have variations in their sequence that affect the protein's interaction with cargo proteins or its regulation, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context.

## Function
KPNA5, also known as karyopherin subunit alpha 5, is a member of the importin alpha family that plays a crucial role in the nuclear import of proteins. It functions as an adaptor protein that recognizes and binds nuclear localization signals (NLS) on cargo proteins. This binding facilitates the formation of a complex with importin beta, which then transports the cargo through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) into the nucleus (OKA2018Importin). 

KPNA5 is involved in the transport of karyophilic proteins, such as transcription factors and DNA repair factors, which are essential for various nuclear processes (OKA2018Importin). The import process is regulated by the small GTPase Ran, which controls the directionality of transport through a RanGTP/GDP gradient between the nucleus and cytoplasm (OKA2018Importin). 

In healthy human cells, KPNA5 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it mediates the import of proteins necessary for maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis. This process is vital for regulating gene expression, cell cycle progression, and other nuclear activities, contributing to the proper functioning of eukaryotic cells (OKA2018Importin).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
KPNA5, a member of the karyopherin alpha family, is involved in nuclear transport by interacting with nuclear localization signals (NLS) on cargo proteins. It forms a complex with importin beta to facilitate the import of proteins into the nucleus. KPNA5 has been shown to interact with various proteins, including transcription factors and viral proteins, which influence cellular processes and viral replication.

In gastric cancer, KPNA5 is part of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network that includes other karyopherins, as revealed by STRING database analysis. This network consists of 7 nodes and 15 edges, indicating potential interactions among differentially expressed karyopherins (Liu2022Mammalian). The study also highlights that KPNA5 expression is linked to immune cell invasion, particularly macrophage invasion, suggesting interactions that may influence tumor growth and immune response (Liu2022Mammalian).

In porcine tissue, KPNA5 has been shown to interact with recombinant proteins SP17 and RREB, although these interactions were observed under in vitro conditions and may differ in vivo (Park2012Identification). These interactions suggest that KPNA5 may have a role in various cellular processes through its ability to bind different proteins.
