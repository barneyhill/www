# RHOU

## Overview
RHOU, also known as WRCH1, is a gene that encodes the protein ras homolog family member U, an atypical member of the Rho GTPase family. Unlike typical Rho GTPases, RHOU is characterized by its GTPase deficiency and unique post-translational modifications, such as palmitoylation, which are crucial for its membrane localization and function (Berzat2005Transforming; Hodge2016Regulating). The RHOU protein plays a pivotal role in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics, cell morphology, and motility, influencing processes such as cell adhesion, actin organization, and migration (Hodge2016Regulating). It interacts with various effector proteins, including p21-activated kinases (PAKs), and is involved in cellular signaling pathways that affect cell proliferation and differentiation (Hodge2017Regulation). RHOU's expression and activity are modulated by signaling pathways such as WNT and JAK/STAT, and it has been implicated in cancer progression and other pathological conditions (Canovas2018The; Loebel2012Rho).

## Structure
RHOU, also known as WRCH1, is a member of the Rho GTPase family characterized by unique structural features. The primary structure of RHOU includes a GTP-binding domain, similar to other members of the Cdc42 subfamily, and is composed of 258 amino acids (Saras2004Wrch1). The protein has distinct N- and C-terminal extensions, with the N-terminal region containing proline-rich motifs (PXXP) that facilitate interactions with SH3 domain-containing proteins (Hodge2017Regulation; Gubar2019The). The C-terminal region includes a CFV motif, where palmitoylation occurs, crucial for membrane localization (Hodge2017Regulation).

RHOU undergoes post-translational modifications, notably palmitoylation, which is essential for its membrane association and function (Berzat2005Transforming). Unlike many other Rho GTPases, RHOU is not prenylated, which affects its interaction with RhoGDIs and its dynamic localization (Hodge2017Regulation). The protein's tertiary structure is influenced by its interaction with various effector proteins, such as p21-activated kinases (PAKs), which are involved in cytoskeletal dynamics and cell migration (Hodge2017Regulation). RHOU's quaternary structure involves interactions with proteins like ARHGAP30 and PAR6, contributing to its role in regulating cell morphology and adhesion (Hodge2017Regulation).

## Function
RHOU, also known as WRCH1, is a member of the Rho GTPase family that plays a significant role in cytoskeletal dynamics, cell morphology, and motility. It is involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and actin organization, influencing cellular processes such as cell shape and migration (Hodge2016Regulating). RHOU is active in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane, where it participates in cellular signaling pathways that affect cell proliferation and differentiation (Hodge2016Regulating).

RHOU is unique among Rho GTPases due to its GTPase deficiency and its modification by palmitoylation, which is crucial for its membrane localization and interaction with effector proteins like PAK kinases (Hodge2016Regulating). This protein is also regulated by phosphorylation, which affects its localization and activity. For instance, SRC-mediated phosphorylation of Tyr254 induces RHOU's translocation from the plasma membrane to endosomes, potentially reducing its activity by moving it away from guanine nucleotide exchange factors (Hodge2016Regulating).

In the context of heart function, RHOU is hypothesized to maintain cell architecture through F-actin polarization, which is crucial for maintaining cardiac function (Herrer2014RNAsequencing). Its expression is influenced by canonical WNT signaling, which affects cell proliferation, fate, and differentiation (Loebel2012Rho).

## Clinical Significance
The RHOU gene, also known as WRCH1, plays a significant role in cancer progression through alterations in its expression levels. Although no point mutations in RHOU have been directly linked to cancer, its increased expression is associated with various cancers, including T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, prostate cancer, multiple myeloma, and breast cancer. In these cancers, elevated RHOU expression correlates with enhanced cell migration and tumor progression (Aspenström2022The).

In multiple myeloma, RHOU expression is modulated with disease progression. It is overexpressed in bone marrow plasma cells from patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and down-modulated in most multiple myeloma patients. However, some patients exhibit high RHOU levels even in late stages, which is associated with a worse prognosis (Canovas2018The). RHOU expression is influenced by IL-6 and the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, with high expression linked to increased cell migration and survival (Canovas2018The).

In colorectal tumors, RHOU expression is decreased, and RHOU knock-out mice show increased cell migration in the gut, indicating that RHOU's role may vary depending on the cellular context (Aspenström2022The).

## Interactions
RHOU, also known as WRCH1, is an atypical Rho GTPase that participates in various protein interactions influencing cell signaling and dynamics. It interacts with PAK family kinases, notably PAK1 and PAK4. PAK1 is activated by RHOU, while PAK4 stabilizes RHOU by protecting it from proteasomal degradation (Hodge2017Regulation). RHOU also interacts with ARHGAP30, a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) active on RhoA and Rac, suggesting a regulatory role in RhoA activity (Slaymi2019The).

RHOU binds to Intersectin proteins, specifically ITSN1 and ITSN2, through SH3 domain interactions. This binding is mediated by the N-terminal proline-rich motifs of RHOU, which are crucial for its role in endosomal recycling pathways (Gubar2019The). The interaction with ITSN2 is particularly important for the fast recycling of transferrin receptors, indicating a role in vesicular trafficking (Gubar2019The).

In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma, RHOU interacts with Annexin A6 (AnxA6), which inhibits RHOU-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by modulating the RHOU/AKT1 signaling pathway (Yang2024SUMOylation). These interactions highlight RHOU's involvement in diverse cellular processes, including cell migration, adhesion, and proliferation.
