# RIOX1

## Overview
RIOX1, or ribosomal oxygenase 1, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is a member of the Jumonji C (JmjC) domain-containing family of proteins. This protein functions primarily as a hydroxylase, catalyzing the hydroxylation of specific histidine residues in ribosomal proteins, a modification crucial for ribosome assembly and function (Bundred2018The; Bräuer2018Phylogenetic). RIOX1 is involved in various cellular processes, including ribosome biogenesis, osteoblast differentiation, and DNA repair, highlighting its multifaceted role in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Xiao2022RIOX1demethylated; Oh2019The). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as transcription factors and DNA repair proteins, underscore its significance in gene expression regulation and genomic stability (Xiao2022RIOX1demethylated; Oh2019The). Given its involvement in critical cellular pathways, alterations in RIOX1 expression or function have been linked to various diseases, including cancer, where it may influence disease progression and treatment outcomes (Pernía2020A; Joosten2018Epigenetics).

## Structure
The RIOX1 protein, also known as ribosomal oxygenase 1, is characterized by a sequence length of 641 amino acids and features several distinct domains that contribute to its function. The protein includes a Jumonji C (JmjC) domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity, specifically hydroxylating ribosomal proteins. This domain contains the active site and iron-coordinating residues essential for catalytic activity (Bräuer2018Phylogenetic; Oh2019The). The JmjC domain is associated with a double-stranded beta-helix fold, which harbors the active site (Bräuer2018Phylogenetic).

RIOX1 also possesses a central dimerization domain responsible for homo-oligomerization and a C-terminal winged-helix (WH) domain, which is unique to ribosomal oxygenases and may play a role in ribosomal protein hydroxylation (Bundred2018The; Bräuer2018Phylogenetic). The N-terminal extension of RIOX1, absent in RIOX2, contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS) that is crucial for its nucleolar accumulation (Bräuer2018Phylogenetic).

The protein's structure facilitates its role in ribosomal function and gene expression regulation, with conserved residues across species indicating a consistent function throughout evolution (Bräuer2018Phylogenetic).

## Function
RIOX1, also known as ribosomal oxygenase 1, is a nucleolar protein that plays a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis and function by hydroxylating histidine residues in ribosomal proteins. Specifically, RIOX1 hydroxylates histidine 216 in the ribosomal protein RPL8, a modification essential for proper ribosome assembly and function (Bundred2018The; Bräuer2018Phylogenetic). This hydroxylation is highly conserved across species, indicating its fundamental role in cellular physiology (Bräuer2018Phylogenetic).

In addition to its role in ribosome biogenesis, RIOX1 is involved in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation and skeletal growth. It interacts with transcription factors such as Osterix, inhibiting their function and thereby influencing bone formation (Oh2019The). RIOX1's activity is linked to the polycomb repressive complex 2, suggesting a role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation (Oh2019The).

RIOX1 also participates in DNA repair processes by modulating the methylation status of proteins involved in homologous recombination repair. It demethylates cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), affecting its interaction with other DNA repair proteins and influencing cellular responses to DNA damage (Xiao2022RIOX1demethylated). This activity highlights RIOX1's broader role in maintaining genomic stability and cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RIOX1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), RIOX1 is identified as potentially involved in disease progression through the Wnt signaling pathway, suggesting that changes in its expression could influence cancer development and response to treatment (Pernía2020A). In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), reduced expression of RIOX1 has been associated with patient prognosis, although results from independent validation studies have been inconsistent (Joosten2018Epigenetics).

In the context of ionizing radiation, RIOX1 plays a significant role in DNA repair processes. Its expression levels are inversely related to radiosensitivity, with high RIOX1 expression correlating with reduced homologous recombination (HR) repair efficiency. This suggests that RIOX1 inhibitors could potentially serve as protective agents during radiotherapy by enhancing HR repair and improving cell survival (Xiao2022RIOX1demethylated).

Overall, the clinical significance of RIOX1 is linked to its role in modulating DNA repair and its potential impact on cancer progression and treatment outcomes. Alterations in RIOX1 expression or function could have significant implications for cellular responses to DNA damage and cancer therapy.

## Interactions
RIOX1, also known as ribosomal oxygenase 1, participates in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It is primarily a nucleolar protein that interacts with the 60S ribosomal protein RPL8, hydroxylating it on specific histidine residues (Oh2019The). RIOX1 also interacts with cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), demethylating it at lysine 491. This demethylation disrupts the interaction between cGAS and the methyl-lysine reader protein SGF29, allowing cGAS to bind with poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) at DNA break sites, which affects homologous recombination repair (Xiao2022RIOX1demethylated).

RIOX1 also forms a complex with Osterix, a protein crucial for osteoblast differentiation, and this association is inversely correlated with the activation status of Osterix target genes, suggesting an inhibitory role (Oh2019The). In cancer, RIOX1 is known to bind with the MYC oncoprotein, jointly activating gene promoters, which is associated with increased metastasis in colorectal cancer (Oh2019The). These interactions highlight RIOX1's role in various cellular processes, including DNA repair, transcriptional regulation, and cancer progression.
