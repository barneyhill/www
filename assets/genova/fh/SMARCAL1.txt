# SMARCAL1

## Overview
SMARCAL1 is a gene that encodes the protein SWI/SNF related, matrix associated, actin dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily a like 1, which is a member of the SNF2 family of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers. This protein plays a pivotal role in maintaining genomic stability by facilitating DNA replication and repair processes, particularly at stalled replication forks. As an annealing helicase, it helps reanneal DNA strands, thereby mitigating replication stress and preventing the accumulation of single-stranded DNA (Bansbach2009The). SMARCAL1 is also involved in the DNA damage response, where it interacts with other proteins and is regulated by phosphorylation events in response to replication stress (Bansbach2009The; Poole2017Functions). Mutations in the SMARCAL1 gene are linked to Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia (SIOD), a rare genetic disorder characterized by growth defects and immune deficiencies (Nagai2023Chromatin). The protein's function is critical for preventing DNA replication-associated genome instability, which can have significant implications for human health (Bansbach2009The).

## Structure
The SMARCAL1 protein is a member of the SNF2 family of ATPases and plays a crucial role in DNA replication and repair. It contains several conserved domains, including two HARP (HepA-related protein) domains, a SNF2 N-terminal domain, and a helicase C-terminal domain (Uzun2009Functional). The HARP domains are approximately 60 residues long and are essential for DNA binding and ATPase activity, with HARP2 being particularly crucial for these functions (Bétous2012SMARCAL1). The HARP domains are involved in recognizing and stabilizing DNA junctions, such as those found at stalled replication forks (Mason2014A).

The protein's structure includes a catalytic domain composed of the HARP2 and ATPase domains, which form a continuous domain necessary for translocation and DNA remodeling (Bétous2012SMARCAL1). The HARP domain has a compact globular fold with a five-stranded β-sheet and two α-helices, similar to DNA-binding domains in other proteins like XPB and UvsW (Mason2014A). The SNF2 domain, which includes motifs I-VI, is crucial for helicase activity and contains the Walker A site, a characteristic feature of helicases (Coleman2000Cloning). The protein does not contain defined motifs like bromodomains or zinc fingers, which are common in other SNF2 proteins (Coleman2000Cloning).

## Function
The SMARCAL1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining genome integrity, particularly at stalled replication forks. In healthy human cells, SMARCAL1 functions as an annealing helicase, which helps to reanneal DNA strands at replication forks, thereby reducing the accumulation of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and preventing replication stress (Bansbach2009The). This activity is dependent on its ATPase and RPA-binding activities, which are essential for its localization to replication stress sites (Bansbach2009The).

SMARCAL1 is involved in the DNA damage response, where it is phosphorylated by kinases such as ATM, ATR, and DNA-PK in response to replication stress (Bansbach2009The). This phosphorylation regulates its activity, ensuring that it acts specifically on stalled replication forks to prevent unnecessary fork reversal during normal DNA replication (Poole2017Functions).

The protein is also essential for replication through telomeres, where its absence can lead to spontaneous double-strand breaks and telomere damage (Poole2017Functions). Overall, SMARCAL1's function is critical for preventing DNA replication-associated genome instability, which can lead to increased DNA damage markers and decreased cell viability under replication stress (Bansbach2009The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SMARCAL1 gene are primarily associated with Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia (SIOD), a rare autosomal recessive disorder. SIOD is characterized by severe growth defects, renal failure, immune deficiencies, and other multisystemic complications such as skeletal dysplasia and cardiovascular issues like premature atherosclerosis and hyperlipidemia (Nagai2023Chromatin; Bansbach2009The). The disorder results from biallelic mutations in SMARCAL1, which can lead to a range of clinical manifestations from mild to severe, including growth failure and nephropathy (Liu2017A; Jin2019Whole).

Alterations in SMARCAL1 expression or function can disrupt normal DNA repair processes, leading to genomic instability. This is particularly evident in its role at stalled replication forks, where loss of SMARCAL1 function results in increased replication stress and DNA damage (Bansbach2009The). SMARCAL1's involvement in lipid metabolism is also significant, as its inactivation leads to reduced expression of genes involved in lipid catabolism, resulting in lipid accumulation and elevated triglyceride levels (Nagai2023Chromatin). Genetic variations in SMARCAL1 are associated with metabolic syndromes, including obesity and diabetes, highlighting its broader impact on human health (Nagai2023Chromatin).

## Interactions
SMARCAL1 is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in the DNA damage response. It interacts with BRG1, another ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling protein, to co-regulate the expression of genes such as ATM and ATR in response to DNA damage. This interaction is dependent on the ATPase activity of both proteins and is disrupted in mutants associated with Schimke Immuno-osseous Dysplasia (SIOD) and Coffin-Siris Syndrome (CSS4) (Bisht2022On). SMARCAL1 and BRG1 are recruited to sites of DNA damage, where they help remodel chromatin to facilitate repair. The HARP domains of SMARCAL1 are crucial for its interaction with BRG1 (Bisht2022On).

SMARCAL1 also interacts with replication protein A (RPA) at stalled replication forks, a critical interaction for its function in DNA repair processes. This interaction is independent of DNA and is essential for stabilizing replication forks and preventing the accumulation of recombination proteins at stalled forks (Postow2009Identification). SMARCAL1 is phosphorylated in response to DNA damage, a modification dependent on ATM and ATR kinase activity, which further supports its role in the DNA damage response (Postow2009Identification).
