# KRTAP4-3

## Overview
KRTAP4-3 is a gene that encodes the keratin-associated protein 4-3, which is a crucial component of the keratin-associated protein family. This family of proteins is integral to the structural integrity and functionality of hair fibers. The keratin-associated protein 4-3 interacts with keratin intermediate filaments (KIFs) to form a matrix that enhances the mechanical strength and resilience of hair. This protein is predominantly active in the hair cortex, where it plays a pivotal role in determining hair texture and quality by modulating the interactions between keratin filaments and other keratin-associated proteins (Litman2023Ancient; Zhou2021The). The KRTAP4 family is distinguished by its low complexity sequence repeats, which are essential for the protein's binding and stabilization of keratin filaments, thereby influencing hair properties such as thickness and curliness (Litman2023Ancient). Variations in the KRTAP4-3 gene can lead to alterations in hair fiber characteristics, affecting aspects like curvature and diameter (Zhou2021The).

## Function
KRTAP4-3, a member of the keratin-associated protein family, plays a significant role in the structure and function of hair fibers. These proteins interact with keratin intermediate filaments (KIFs) to form a matrix that contributes to the mechanical strength and resilience of hair. KRTAP4-3 is primarily active in the hair cortex, where it influences hair texture and quality by affecting the interaction between keratin filaments and other KAP proteins (Litman2023Ancient; Zhou2021The).

The KRTAP4 family, to which KRTAP4-3 belongs, is characterized by multiple repeats of low complexity sequences, which are important in the evolution of vertebrate proteins. These sequences are crucial for the protein's ability to bind and stabilize keratin filaments, thereby impacting the physical properties of hair, such as thickness and curliness (Litman2023Ancient).

KRTAP4-3's role extends beyond structural support, as variations in its gene can lead to changes in hair fiber properties. These variations can affect the protein's interaction with KIFs, influencing fiber characteristics like curvature and diameter (Zhou2021The). Despite its importance in hair biology, specific molecular functions of KRTAP4-3 in cell biology remain less detailed in the literature.
