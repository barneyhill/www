# CD151

## Overview
CD151 is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the tetraspanin family, known as the CD151 molecule or Raph blood group. This protein is characterized by its four transmembrane domains, which facilitate its role as a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes. The CD151 protein is integral to cell adhesion, migration, and signaling, primarily through its interactions with integrins such as α3β1, α6β1, α6β4, and α7β1. These interactions are crucial for the stabilization of hemidesmosomes and the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, influencing cell morphology and motility (Sterk2000The; Hemler2005Tetraspanin). CD151 is also implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis, contributing to the structural integrity of epithelial tissues and the organization of the basement membrane (Charrin2009Lateral). Mutations in the CD151 gene are associated with various clinical conditions, including kidney and skin disorders, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular and tissue homeostasis (Rahmani2022New; Karamatic2004CD151).

## Structure
CD151 is a member of the tetraspanin family, characterized by four conserved transmembrane domains, two extracellular loops, and short cytoplasmic tails (Sterk2000The; Fitter1998Characterisation). The primary structure of CD151 includes a high degree of conservation between species, with a 93% amino acid identity between mouse and human CD151, particularly in the transmembrane regions (Fitter1998Characterisation). The large extracellular loop is involved in binding to integrins, such as α3β1 and α6β4, which are crucial for its role in cell adhesion and hemidesmosome formation (Sterk2000The).

CD151 forms complexes with integrins, influencing cell signaling and adhesion, which suggests a quaternary structure involving these protein-protein interactions (Sterk2000The). The protein is glycosylated, a common post-translational modification that may affect its function and interactions (Sterk2000The). The CD151 gene has multiple splice variants that differ in their 5' untranslated regions but encode the same protein, indicating that these isoforms may have regulatory roles rather than structural differences (Fitter1998Characterisation). The specific molecular structure details, such as secondary and tertiary structures, are not explicitly detailed in the available context.

## Function
CD151 is a tetraspanin protein that plays a significant role in integrin-dependent cell adhesion, migration, and signaling. It is primarily active in the plasma membrane, where it organizes cell membrane microdomains and interacts with integrins such as α3β1, α6β1, α6β4, and α7β1 (Sterk2002Association). These interactions are crucial for various cellular functions, including cell adhesion, motility, and the stabilization of hemidesmosomes, which are structures that link intermediate filaments to the extracellular matrix in epithelial cells (Sterk2000The).

CD151 is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and cell motility by preferentially activating Rho-family GTPases Rac and Cdc42, which influence cell spreading and morphology (Hemler2005Tetraspanin). It also plays a role in integrin-dependent adhesion strengthening, which enhances cellular resistance to detachment and affects processes like platelet aggregation and angiogenesis (Charrin2009Lateral; Hemler2005Tetraspanin).

In addition to its role in cell adhesion and motility, CD151 is implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis through its influence on signaling pathways, such as the Ras-ERK/MAPK pathway (Hemler2005Tetraspanin). Its involvement in these molecular processes contributes to maintaining the structural integrity of epithelial tissues and the organization of the basement membrane (Charrin2009Lateral).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CD151 gene are associated with a range of clinical conditions, primarily affecting the kidneys and skin. A frameshift mutation in exon 5 of CD151 results in a truncated protein lacking most of the large extracellular loop, leading to end-stage kidney disease, nephrotic syndrome, pretibial bullous skin lesions, neurosensory deafness, bilateral lacrimal duct stenosis, nail dystrophy, and β-thalassemia minor (Karamatic2004CD151). Another mutation, c.351+2T>C, has been linked to epidermolysis bullosa-type skin blisters and renal abnormalities, with variable expressivity among patients, including kidney agenesis and end-stage renal disease (Rahmani2022New).

CD151 mutations can also cause a condition resembling Kindler syndrome-like epidermolysis bullosa, characterized by skin fragility and nephropathy. This is due to a homozygous donor splice site mutation leading to aberrant splicing and the absence of CD151 protein, affecting the ultrastructure of basal keratinocytes (Vahidnezhad2018Recessive). The absence of CD151 in podocytes can lead to kidney abnormalities, as observed in Cd151 knockout mice, suggesting that genetic background influences susceptibility to kidney failure (Sachs2012Blood). These findings underscore the critical role of CD151 in maintaining the integrity of the glomerular and tubular basement membranes.

## Interactions
CD151, a member of the tetraspanin family, is known for its interactions with various integrins, forming complexes that play significant roles in cell adhesion, migration, and signaling. It specifically associates with integrins such as α3β1, α6β1, α6β4, and α7β1. These interactions are crucial for processes like cellular morphogenesis and cell migration (Sterk2002Association; Zhang2002Function). The CD151-α3β1 complex is particularly stable, even under stringent conditions, and is implicated in regulating cell migration by linking to phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (Yauch1998Highly).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, CD151 forms a complex with integrin β1, which is essential for cell migration and invasion. This interaction modulates the expression and secretion of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), enhancing the invasive potential of HCC cells (Devbhandari2011Profiling). CD151 also interacts with c-Met, forming a complex that can inhibit cancer cell migration, and enhances receptor signaling through integrin β4-mediated pathways (Devbhandari2011Profiling).

CD151 is also involved in forming tetraspanin-enriched microdomains by associating with other tetraspanins like CD9, CD63, and CD81, which organize cell surface molecules and influence cellular processes (FITTER1999Transmembrane; Sterk2002Association).
