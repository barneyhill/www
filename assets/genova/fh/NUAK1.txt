# NUAK1

## Overview
NUAK1 is a gene that encodes the NUAK family kinase 1, a serine/threonine-protein kinase belonging to the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) family. This kinase plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, motility, and genomic stability, by phosphorylating target proteins such as MYPT1 and LATS1 (Zagórska2010New; Humbert2009Regulation). NUAK1 is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle and tumor suppression through its interaction with the tumor suppressor protein p53 (Hou2011A). The protein's interactions with components of the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) complex and spliceosomal proteins underscore its significance in cellular signaling and mRNA processing (Cossa2020Localized). Clinically, NUAK1 is associated with various diseases, including colorectal and ovarian cancers, where its expression levels correlate with disease progression and patient prognosis (Port2018Colorectal; Phippen2016NUAK1). Additionally, NUAK1 has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its broad impact on human health (Courchet2018Haploinsufficiency).

## Structure
NUAK1, a serine/threonine-protein kinase, is part of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) family. The protein contains an N-terminal kinase domain essential for its enzymatic activity (Banerjee2013Characterization). This domain is involved in phosphorylating specific serine residues on target proteins, such as MYPT1, which is crucial for its regulatory functions (Zagórska2010New). NUAK1 interacts with the MYPT1-PP1b complex through conserved Gly-Ile-Leu-Lys (GILK) motifs located in its C-terminal region. These motifs are critical for binding to the PP1b component of the complex (Zagórska2010New).

Post-translational modifications of NUAK1 include phosphorylation at specific serine residues, such as Ser 476 and Ser 480, which are important for its interaction with the SCF βTrCP E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, leading to its ubiquitylation and degradation (Banerjee2014Interplay). These phosphorylation sites are conserved across species, indicating their fundamental role in NUAK1's function (Banerjee2014Interplay). The protein's structure and interactions suggest a complex regulatory mechanism involving multiple protein partners and phosphorylation events. However, specific details about the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of NUAK1 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
NUAK1, a serine/threonine protein kinase, plays a significant role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and motility through its interaction with the myosin phosphatase complex. NUAK1 phosphorylates MYPT1, a component of this complex, at specific serine residues, which inhibits the phosphatase activity and leads to increased phosphorylation of the myosin light chain (MLC2). This process is crucial for cell adhesion and motility, particularly during cell detachment (Zagórska2010New).

NUAK1 also regulates cellular senescence and ploidy. It is implicated in maintaining genomic stability by phosphorylating LATS1, a protein involved in cell growth and senescence, thereby controlling its protein levels. This regulation is independent of the p53 pathway, suggesting a unique mechanism by which NUAK1 influences senescence (Humbert2009Regulation).

In addition, NUAK1 interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, phosphorylating it at specific residues, which is essential for cell cycle arrest and the regulation of cell proliferation. This interaction highlights NUAK1's role in tumor suppression and cell cycle regulation (Hou2011A).

## Clinical Significance
NUAK1 (NUAK family kinase 1) is implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression or mutations. In colorectal cancer, NUAK1 is overexpressed, particularly in advanced stages and in patients with lymph node metastasis, correlating with poor patient outcomes and reduced overall survival. Its inhibition has been shown to induce apoptosis in colorectal cancer cell lines, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Port2018Colorectal). 

In ovarian cancer, high NUAK1 expression is associated with poor prognosis and aggressive clinical features, such as advanced stage and residual disease post-surgery. It is particularly prevalent in the mesenchymal subtype of ovarian cancer (Phippen2016NUAK1). NUAK1 also plays a role in epithelial ovarian cancer metastasis by regulating fibronectin production, which is crucial for spheroid integrity and intraperitoneal metastasis (Fritz2020A).

NUAK1 is also involved in neurodevelopmental disorders. Haploinsufficiency of NUAK1 can lead to defects in brain connectivity and behavior, which are compatible with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability, and schizophrenia. NUAK1 mutations, particularly rare de novo mutations, may result in loss-of-function effects, impacting axon branching and mitochondria trafficking (Courchet2018Haploinsufficiency).

## Interactions
NUAK1, also known as NUAK family kinase 1, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) complexes, particularly binding to the nuclear pool of the protein phosphatase catalytic subunit beta (PPP1CB) and the cytoplasmic PP1 regulatory subunit MYPT1. This interaction is mediated by conserved Gly-Ile-Leu-Lys (GILK) motifs, which are crucial for binding to the MYPT1-PP1b complex (Zagórska2010New; Cossa2020Localized).

NUAK1 also associates with proteins involved in mRNA splicing, including components of the U2 and U12 spliceosomal snRNP complexes, the Prp19 complex, and the methylosome. It co-localizes with the spliceosomal protein SC35 and interacts with SF3B1, a component of the spliceosome (Cossa2020Localized). NUAK1's interaction with the PP1-nuclear targeting subunit (PNUTS) is significant for its role in the nucleus, where it phosphorylates PNUTS at serine 313, affecting chromatin association and spliceosome activity (Cossa2020Localized).

Additionally, NUAK1 interacts with the tumor suppressor p53, phosphorylating it at specific residues, which is crucial for cell cycle regulation and transcriptional activity (Hou2011A). These interactions highlight NUAK1's role in regulating various cellular pathways through its kinase activity.
