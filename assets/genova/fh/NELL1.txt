# NELL1

## Overview
NELL1 (neural EGFL like 1) is a gene that encodes a secreted glycoprotein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in osteogenesis, the formation and mineralization of bone. The protein encoded by NELL1 is characterized by its complex structure, which includes multiple domains such as thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1)-like modules, von Willebrand factor C domains, and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, classifying it as a multifunctional signaling molecule (Kuroda1999Biochemical; Watanabe1996Cloning). NELL1 plays a pivotal role in promoting the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into osteoblasts while inhibiting their differentiation into adipocytes, thus influencing bone health and density (Pakvasa2017Neural; Wang2017NELLike). It interacts with several signaling pathways, including Wnt/β-catenin and Bone Morphogenic Proteins (BMPs), and is involved in protein interactions with integrins and other receptors, which are crucial for its function in cellular signaling and bone formation (Pakvasa2017Neural; Shen2012NELL‐1). NELL1's clinical significance is underscored by its association with craniosynostosis and other skeletal abnormalities, as well as its potential role in cancer progression, making it a target of interest for therapeutic applications in bone regeneration and cancer treatment (Zhang2002Craniosynostosis; Peters2018DNA).

## Structure
The NELL1 protein is characterized by its complex molecular structure, which includes several distinct domains and motifs. It encodes a polypeptide of 810 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 89,211 Da (Kuroda1999Biochemical). The protein contains a secretion signal peptide, indicating its role in cellular signaling pathways (Kuroda1999Biochemical). NELL1 features an NH2-terminal thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1)-like module, which is involved in cell-matrix interactions, and five von Willebrand factor C domains, which are typically associated with protein-protein interactions (Kuroda1999Biochemical).

The protein also includes six epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, which are crucial for mediating protein-protein interactions and are involved in various cellular processes (Watanabe1996Cloning). These EGF-like domains are divided into three Ca2+-binding and three non-Ca2+-binding types, contributing to the protein's structural stability and function (Kuroda1999Biochemical). NELL1 is glycosylated, with a 50-kDa N-linked carbohydrate moiety, which may influence its stability and interactions (Kuroda1999Biochemical). The protein is suggested to form homotrimeric structures, which could be important for its biological activity (Kuroda1999Biochemical).

## Function
NELL1 (neural EGFL like 1) is a gene that encodes a secreted glycoprotein involved in osteogenesis, the process of bone formation and mineralization. In healthy human cells, NELL1 plays a crucial role in promoting the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into osteoblasts, which are bone-forming cells, while inhibiting their differentiation into adipocytes, or fat cells (Pakvasa2017Neural; Wang2017NELLike). This dual action is mediated through its interaction with several signaling pathways, including the Wnt/β-catenin and Bone Morphogenic Proteins (BMPs) pathways, which are essential for osteogenic differentiation (Li2019Nell1; Pakvasa2017Neural).

NELL1 enhances the expression of key osteogenic markers such as Runx2 and Osterix, which are vital for osteoblast differentiation and bone mineralization (Pakvasa2017Neural; Wang2017NELLike). It also interacts with the MAPK pathways, specifically ERK1/2 and JNK, to induce phosphorylation of Runx2, further promoting osteogenesis (Pakvasa2017Neural). NELL1's activity is primarily localized in osteoblasts and osteoclasts, where it influences bone formation and resorption, contributing to the maintenance of bone health and density (Li2019Nell1). These functions underscore NELL1's importance in skeletal development and its potential therapeutic applications in bone regeneration and repair.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the NELL1 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. NELL1 is implicated in craniosynostosis, a disorder characterized by the premature fusion of cranial sutures, leading to skull shape abnormalities. Overexpression of NELL1 in transgenic mouse models has been shown to replicate the craniofacial defects observed in human craniosynostosis, indicating its significant role in craniofacial development (Zhang2002Craniosynostosis).

NELL1 mutations also contribute to skeletal abnormalities, including conditions resembling Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS), which is characterized by hyperextensible skin and joint flexibility. The Nell1 6R mutation in mice results in reduced expression of extracellular matrix proteins, leading to cranial and vertebral defects, and is linked to decreased bone mineralization (Desai2006Nell1deficient).

In cancer, NELL1 expression is epigenetically silenced in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) through promoter hypermethylation, which is associated with advanced disease and metastasis. This silencing suggests a role for NELL1 in tumor progression and highlights its potential as a clinical marker for RCC (Peters2018DNA). Additionally, NELL1 is involved in osteosarcoma, where its deletion affects extracellular matrix composition and signaling pathways critical for tumor growth (Qin2022NELL1).

## Interactions
NELL1 (neural EGFL like 1) is involved in several protein interactions that play crucial roles in cellular processes. NELL1 interacts with protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms, particularly PKCδ, PKCβI, and PKCε, through its epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains. These interactions are isoform-specific and involve phosphorylation, suggesting a role in intracellular signaling pathways (Kuroda1999Involvement).

NELL1 also binds to Integrinβ1, a cell surface receptor, promoting cell adhesion and osteogenic differentiation. This interaction is mediated through the thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1)-like module of NELL1, which contains a conserved LDVP sequence. The binding to Integrinβ1 activates focal adhesion kinase (FAK), crucial for cytoskeleton organization and cell adhesion (Shen2012NELL‐1).

Additionally, NELL1 interacts with the Robo2 receptor, where specific domains in both proteins are necessary for binding. This interaction is influenced by the conformation of Robo2, which can expose cryptic binding sites under certain conditions, such as acidic environments (Yamamoto2019Robo2).

NELL1 also binds to Contactin-Associated Protein-like 4 (Cntnap4), acting as a receptor that mediates osteogenesis. Depleting Cntnap4 expression reduces NELL1-induced osteogenesis, highlighting its role in bone formation (Li2019Nell1).
