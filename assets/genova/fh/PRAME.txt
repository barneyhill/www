# PRAME

## Overview
PRAME (Preferentially Expressed Antigen in Melanoma) is a gene that encodes the PRAME nuclear receptor transcriptional regulator, a protein involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and protein ubiquitylation. The PRAME protein is characterized by leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which facilitate its role as a transcriptional repressor, particularly in inhibiting retinoic acid receptor (RAR) signaling. This inhibition affects key cellular functions such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. PRAME is typically expressed at low levels in normal tissues but is overexpressed in several cancers, where it contributes to tumor progression and poor prognosis. It functions as a subunit of Cullin2-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes and interacts with multiple proteins, highlighting its involvement in complex regulatory networks (Epping2005The; Costessi2011The; Wadelin2010Leucinerich).

## Structure
The PRAME protein is characterized by leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which are motifs typically 20-30 amino acids in length, forming a beta sheet followed by an alpha-helix. This structure creates a curved solenoid fold with a parallel beta sheet on the concave side and helical elements on the convex side (Wadelin2010Leucinerich). PRAME contains nine LRRs and is predicted to have a fold similar to the LRR domains of Toll-like receptors and internalin proteins (Antonietti2023Intrinsic; Wadelin2010Leucinerich).

PRAME is a moderately disordered protein, with intrinsically disordered regions (IDPRs) that include residues 1-23, 138-172, and 487-509. These regions are enriched with serine residues, which are significant as phosphorylation sites (Antonietti2023Intrinsic). The protein also contains droplet-promoting regions and aggregation hot spots, which may influence its phase separation properties (Antonietti2023Intrinsic).

PRAME undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation, which may affect its function and interactions (Antonietti2023Intrinsic). The protein is encoded by multiple mRNA transcripts, all of which encode an identical polypeptide of 509 amino acids, suggesting alternative transcription start sites (Wadelin2010Leucinerich).

## Function
PRAME (Preferentially Expressed Antigen in Melanoma) is involved in several molecular processes, primarily acting as a transcriptional repressor of retinoic acid receptor (RAR) signaling. It contains nuclear receptor (NR) boxes that allow it to modulate nuclear receptor signaling, specifically inhibiting retinoic acid (RA)-induced activation of RAR-driven genes. This inhibition affects cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis by repressing RAR target genes (Epping2005The).

In healthy human cells, PRAME is typically expressed at low levels or not at all, suggesting its role is limited under normal conditions. However, it is involved in transcriptional regulation by associating with active NFY promoters, where it correlates with active transcriptional marks and higher RNA Polymerase II occupancy. This indicates a role in promoting gene expression and modulating chromatin structure (Costessi2011The).

PRAME is also a subunit of a Cullin2-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, suggesting a role in ubiquitination processes. It interacts with the Cullin2-EloBC complex, acting as a substrate recognition subunit, which may be involved in tagging proteins for degradation or other regulatory processes (Costessi2011The). Despite its potential regulatory functions, the exact role of PRAME in healthy cells remains to be fully elucidated (Costessi2011The).

## Clinical Significance
PRAME (PRAME nuclear receptor transcriptional regulator) is significantly implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PRAME is overexpressed compared to normal tissue and is associated with tumor progression, higher histological grades, increased vascular invasion, and poorer survival probabilities. It is a target of the Gas6/Axl signaling pathway, which promotes cancer cell invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), contributing to a migratory and invasive phenotype in liver cancer cell lines (Hedrich2023PRAME). PRAME interacts with proteins such as CCAR1, AGAP1, and SH3PXD2B, which are linked to tumor progression, suggesting its role in promoting oncogenic characteristics (Hedrich2023PRAME).

In myxoid liposarcoma (MLS), PRAME is upregulated compared to normal adipose tissue and is associated with poor prognostic factors such as larger tumor diameter, tumor necrosis, and higher histological grade. Its high expression correlates with poor prognosis, making it a potential target for immunotherapy (Iura2015Cancer‐testis). PRAME's role in repressing retinoic acid receptor signaling further promotes cell proliferation and prevents apoptosis in MLS (Iura2015Cancer‐testis).

## Interactions
PRAME (Preferentially Expressed Antigen in Melanoma) is involved in several protein interactions, particularly as a component of multiprotein complexes. It is a subunit of Cullin2-based E3 ubiquitin ligases, interacting with the Cullin2-EloBC complex. This interaction is facilitated by PRAME's BC-box and Cul2-box motifs, which are essential for binding to Elongin C and Cullin2, respectively (Costessi2011The). PRAME also associates with the Elongin BC complex, specifically interacting with Elongin C, as confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid studies (Wadelin2013PRAME).

PRAME is linked to the EKC/KEOPS complex, where it interacts with subunits such as OSGEP and LAGE3. These interactions are stable and suggest a role for PRAME in recruiting the EKC/KEOPS complex to Cullin2 ubiquitin ligases (Costessi2012The). PRAME's interaction with LAGE3 enhances its association with OSGEP, indicating a cooperative binding mechanism (Costessi2012The).

In addition to protein interactions, PRAME binds to core histones, particularly histone H3, suggesting a role in chromatin association and gene expression regulation (Wadelin2013PRAME). These interactions highlight PRAME's involvement in transcriptional regulation and protein ubiquitylation processes.
