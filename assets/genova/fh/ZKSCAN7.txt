# ZKSCAN7

## Overview
ZKSCAN7 is a gene that encodes the protein zinc finger with KRAB and SCAN domains 7, which is involved in transcriptional regulation. This protein is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which facilitate DNA binding, and contains both a KRAB (Kruppel-associated box) domain and a SCAN domain. The KRAB domain is known for its role in transcriptional repression, while the SCAN domain is involved in protein-protein interactions. ZKSCAN7 is implicated in various biological processes, including gene regulation and cellular adaptation, and has been associated with disease susceptibility, particularly in cancer. Genetic variations, such as nonsynonymous SNPs, can influence the protein's interactions with cofactors like KAP1 (TRIM28), affecting its regulatory functions and potential role in adaptive changes in human populations (Perdomo-Sabogal2019Genetic).

## Structure
ZKSCAN7 is a human protein characterized by zinc finger motifs, which are essential for its DNA-binding capabilities. These motifs are stabilized by the coordination of zinc ions, primarily involving cysteine and histidine residues, which form a fingerlike structure crucial for DNA-binding specificity (Perdomo-Sabogal2019Genetic). The protein contains a KRAB (Kruppel-associated box) domain, known for its role in transcriptional repression, and a SCAN domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions (Perdomo-Sabogal2019Genetic). 

The primary structure of ZKSCAN7 is rich in cysteine and histidine residues, which are integral to the formation of its zinc finger motifs. These motifs contribute to the secondary structure, forming beta sheets and alpha helices that stabilize the protein's conformation. The tertiary structure is likely influenced by the arrangement of these motifs, allowing for specific DNA interactions and binding with cofactors such as KAP1 (TRIM28), which is involved in the repressor activity of KRAB-ZNF proteins (Perdomo-Sabogal2019Genetic).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may affect the function and interactions of ZKSCAN7, although specific modifications are not detailed in the available context. The protein's structure and genetic variations suggest a role in local adaptation and disease susceptibility (Perdomo-Sabogal2019Genetic).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ZKSCAN7 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), ZKSCAN7 exhibits higher mutation frequencies in the TNBCSASP1 subtype compared to TNBCSASP2. This subtype is characterized by lower immune cell infiltration and higher tumor cell proportion, correlating with an immunosuppressed state and a worse prognosis. The study suggests that these mutations may impact tumor-related pathways, although the specific clinical significance of ZKSCAN7 mutations in TNBC is not detailed (Huang2023A).

In the context of drug resistance, ZKSCAN7 has been identified as a 'paclitaxel-sensitive candidate' in TNBC cell lines. Alterations in its expression were associated with changes in response to paclitaxel treatment, indicating its potential role in chemotherapy resistance. This suggests that ZKSCAN7 may have clinical significance in breast cancer treatment, although specific details on its mutations or expression changes are not provided (Lian2020Truncated).

The genetic variation in ZKSCAN7, particularly nonsynonymous SNPs, may also affect its interaction with cofactors like KAP1, potentially influencing regulatory diversity and adaptation in human populations (Perdomo-Sabogal2019Genetic).

## Interactions
ZKSCAN7 is a gene that encodes a protein with zinc finger domains, which are typically involved in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. The protein contains both KRAB and SCAN domains, suggesting roles in protein-protein interactions and transcriptional repression. The interactions of ZKSCAN7 with other proteins or nucleic acids are influenced by genetic variations, particularly nonsynonymous SNPs that affect the amino acid sequence of the KRAB domain and the first amino acid between the two histidines of the first zinc finger of ZKSCAN7. These changes may impact the protein's interactions with the coregulator KAP1 (also known as TRIM28) and DNA-binding sites (Perdomo-Sabogal2019Genetic).

The KRAB domain is crucial for the repressor activity of KRAB-ZNF proteins, and variations in this domain can alter DNA-binding specificity and influence interactions with cofactors like KAP1. This interaction is significant as KAP1 is known to interact with the KRAB domain, potentially affecting the regulatory functions of ZKSCAN7 (Perdomo-Sabogal2019Genetic). These interactions highlight the potential role of ZKSCAN7 in gene regulatory processes and its contribution to adaptive regulatory changes in human populations.
