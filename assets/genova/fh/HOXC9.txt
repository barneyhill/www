# HOXC9

## Overview
The HOXC9 gene is a member of the homeobox gene family, which encodes transcription factors that play pivotal roles in regulating developmental processes. The protein encoded by HOXC9, known as homeobox C9, is characterized by a homeodomain that facilitates its function as a transcription factor. This protein is involved in the regulation of gene expression critical for neuronal differentiation and development, particularly within the nervous system (Wang2013HOXC9). As a transcription factor, homeobox C9 influences a variety of cellular processes by interacting with other proteins and DNA sequences, thereby modulating the expression of genes involved in neurogenesis, cell cycle regulation, and DNA repair (Wang2013HOXC9; Zhou2008MH1). The clinical significance of HOXC9 is underscored by its role in neuroblastoma, where its expression levels are associated with tumor progression and patient prognosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Mao2011HOXC9; Kocak2013HoxC9).

## Structure
The HOXC9 protein is a transcription factor characterized by a homeodomain, a 60-amino acid DNA-binding domain encoded by a 180-base pair DNA sequence known as the homeobox. This homeodomain adopts a three-alpha-helix fold, including a helix-turn-helix motif typical for DNA binding, with the third helix serving as the recognition helix that makes contact with DNA bases (Zhou2008MH1; Zhou20141H). The N-terminal arm of the homeodomain, particularly the positively charged segment Arg190-Arg196, is critical for interaction with other proteins, such as the MH1 domain of Smad4, which can inhibit HOXC9's transcriptional activity by occupying one of its DNA binding sites (Zhou2008MH1).

The HOXC9 protein can also interact with the cell cycle regulator Geminin, with studies providing complete chemical shift assignments for the homeodomain in complex with Geminin's binding region (Zhou20141H). While specific details on the tertiary and quaternary structures, post-translational modifications, or splice variant isoforms of HOXC9 are not provided, the protein's interaction capabilities suggest a role in regulating diverse cellular processes through complex formation with other proteins.

## Function
The HOXC9 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in neuronal differentiation by regulating the expression of a large number of genes involved in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, HOXC9 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of genes that promote nervous system development, including those controlling neuron generation, differentiation, axonogenesis, and synapse formation (Wang2013HOXC9). It upregulates genes such as ASCL1, GFRA3, RET, and NTN3, which are critical for sympathetic neurogenesis and axonogenesis (Wang2013HOXC9).

HOXC9 also represses genes associated with cell cycle progression and DNA repair, including cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases, and genes involved in various DNA repair pathways. This repression is linked to cell cycle arrest and reduced DNA damage response, facilitating neuronal differentiation (Wang2013HOXC9). The gene's ability to repress cell cycle genes depends on its interaction with the transcription repressor E2F6, which helps establish a repressive chromatin structure (Wang2013HOXC9).

HOXC9's regulatory actions suggest it coordinates molecular and cellular processes necessary for neuronal differentiation by promoting neuronal gene expression while inhibiting cell cycle and DNA repair pathways (Wang2013HOXC9).

## Clinical Significance
The HOXC9 gene has significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of neuroblastoma, a childhood cancer of the sympathetic nervous system. Alterations in HOXC9 expression are associated with various clinical outcomes in neuroblastoma patients. High expression levels of HOXC9 are linked to favorable prognostic markers, including spontaneous regression of the tumor, better overall survival, and event-free survival rates (Mao2011HOXC9; Kocak2013HoxC9). HOXC9 expression is also associated with neuronal differentiation and growth arrest in neuroblastoma cells, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (Wang2013HOXC9; Mao2011HOXC9).

In neuroblastoma, HOXC9 induces apoptosis through the intrinsic pathway, which involves the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and activation of caspases (Kocak2013HoxC9). The gene's expression is upregulated by retinoic acid, and its knockdown confers resistance to retinoic acid-induced differentiation and growth arrest (Mao2011HOXC9). In some neuroblastoma cell lines, HOXC9 expression is epigenetically silenced, but re-expression can inhibit proliferation and tumorigenicity, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Mao2011HOXC9). These findings underscore the importance of HOXC9 in neuroblastoma pathogenesis and its potential role in therapeutic strategies.

## Interactions
HOXC9 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. One notable interaction is with the MH1 domain of the Smad4 protein. This interaction involves the homeodomain of HOXC9 (Hoxc9-HD) and is characterized by a moderately strong binding affinity with a dissociation constant (Kd) of approximately 400 nM. The N-terminal arm of Hoxc9-HD, particularly the positively charged DNA-binding segment Arg190-Arg196, is crucial for this interaction. Mutations in this region result in a loss of interaction, suggesting that Smad4-MH1 may inhibit HOXC9's transcription activity by occupying one of its DNA binding sites (Zhou2008MH1).

HOXC9 also interacts with E2F6, a transcriptional repressor. This interaction is essential for HOXC9-induced cell cycle arrest and transcriptional repression of cell cycle genes. HOXC9 recruits E2F6 to the promoters of cell cycle genes, such as CCNB1 and CDCA8, to repress their expression, which is crucial for its role in coordinating cellular processes during differentiation (Wang2013HOXC9).

Additionally, HOXC9 binds directly to the IL-8 promoter, acting as a transcriptional repressor. This interaction is significant in regulating endothelial cell behavior and angiogenesis by inhibiting IL-8 expression (Stoll2011The).
