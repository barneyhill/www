# MRPL47

## Overview
MRPL47 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein L47, which is a component of the large 39S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein is integral to the mitochondrial translation machinery, facilitating the synthesis of proteins necessary for oxidative phosphorylation and energy production within the cell (Cheong2020Expression). The MRPL47 gene is ubiquitously expressed across mammalian tissues, although its expression is tightly regulated, reflecting its critical role in cellular and developmental processes (Cheong2020Expression). Evolutionarily, MRPL47 shares distant homology with the bacterial RPL29 ribosomal protein family, indicating its specialized adaptation for mitochondrial functions in eukaryotes (Smits2007Reconstructing). The protein's involvement in essential cellular processes underscores its significance in both normal physiology and disease states, including various cancers and mitochondrial disorders (Phasukkijwatana2010Genomewide; Guttapadu2023Identification).

## Function
MRPL47 encodes a protein that is a component of the mitochondrial ribosome, specifically the large 39S subunit. This protein plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by translating mitochondrial mRNA into functional proteins, which are essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production (Cheong2020Expression). The expression of MRPL47 is critical during early development, as MRPL47 null embryos are likely arrested at the pre-gastrulation stage, indicating its essential role in early embryonic development (Cheong2020Expression).

MRPL47 is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues, although it shows specific absence in certain developmental stages or tissues, suggesting a tightly regulated expression pattern necessary for its function (Cheong2020Expression). The protein is involved in the assembly and function of the mitoribosome, which is essential for mitochondrial translation machinery. This process is vital for the synthesis of proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation, a key pathway for ATP production in cells (Cheong2020Expression).

Evolutionary analysis indicates that MRPL47 has a distant homology with the bacterial RPL29 ribosomal protein family, suggesting an evolutionary adaptation to specific mitoribosomal functions in eukaryotes (Smits2007Reconstructing). This evolutionary divergence highlights the unique role of MRPL47 in mitochondrial biology.

## Clinical Significance
MRPL47 has been identified as a gene with potential clinical significance in various cancers. In lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), MRPL47 is overexpressed across all cancer stages and is associated with poorer patient survival, suggesting its role as a prognostic biomarker (Guttapadu2023Identification). Similarly, in breast cancer, MRPL47 is among the mitochondrial ribosomal proteins that are upregulated, although its genetic alterations are not significantly linked to prognosis (Lin2022Expression). The gene is also implicated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, where it is part of a gene signature used for prognostic risk modeling and personalized immunotherapy (Bao2022Potential).

Beyond cancer, MRPL47 has been studied in the context of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), a mitochondrial disorder. Although no significant associations were found between MRPL47 SNPs and LHON, it remains a candidate gene due to its mitochondrial localization (Phasukkijwatana2010Genomewide). The gene's essential role in mitochondrial function is underscored by studies showing that its absence leads to early developmental arrest in mice, indicating its critical involvement in cellular energy production (Cheong2020Expression).
