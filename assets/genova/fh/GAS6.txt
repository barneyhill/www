# GAS6

## Overview
The GAS6 gene encodes the growth arrest-specific 6 protein, a member of the vitamin K-dependent protein family, which plays a pivotal role in cellular processes such as survival, proliferation, and migration. The GAS6 protein functions primarily as a ligand for the TAM receptor tyrosine kinases, including Tyro3, Axl, and Mer, facilitating critical signaling pathways that regulate immune responses and apoptotic cell clearance (Grommes2007Regulation; Nagata1996Identification). Structurally, GAS6 is characterized by a gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) domain, four epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, and a sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)-like domain, which are essential for its interaction with TAM receptors (Wu2017Molecular; Sasaki2005Structural). The GAS6/AXL signaling axis is notably significant in oncogenesis, influencing tumor cell proliferation and survival, and is implicated in various diseases, including cancer, autoimmune disorders, and fibrotic conditions (Qin2016Analysis; Zhai2023Gas6AXL).

## Structure
The GAS6 protein is a member of the vitamin K-dependent protein family and is structurally characterized by several distinct domains. It contains a gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) domain at the N-terminus, which is crucial for binding to phospholipid membranes through calcium-dependent interactions (Wu2017Molecular; Sasaki2005Structural). Following the Gla domain, there are four epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, each containing a consensus sequence for β-hydroxylation of Asp and Asn residues, which are involved in high-affinity protein-protein interactions (Manfioletti1993The; Wu2017Molecular).

At the C-terminus, GAS6 features a sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)-like domain, comprising two laminin G-like (LG) subdomains. This domain is essential for binding to receptor tyrosine kinases of the TAM family, such as Axl, and is involved in downstream signaling pathways (Wu2017Molecular; Sasaki2005Structural). The SHBG-like domain is crucial for receptor interaction, as a mutant composed only of this domain retains receptor-binding and biological activities (Wu2017Molecular).

GAS6 undergoes post-translational modifications, including gamma-carboxylation, which are typical for vitamin K-dependent proteins (Sasaki2005Structural). A splice variant of GAS6, termed gas6SV, includes an additional 43 amino acid peptide due to an in-frame 129 bp insertion (Marcandalli1997Identification).

## Function
The GAS6 gene encodes a protein that functions as a ligand for the TAM receptor tyrosine kinases, which include Tyro3, Axl, and Mer. This protein plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including cell survival, proliferation, and migration. GAS6 is particularly important in the regulation of immune responses and the clearance of apoptotic cells. It acts as a molecular bridge between apoptotic cells and phagocytes, facilitating the efficient removal of dying cells without triggering inflammation (Grommes2007Regulation; Nagata1996Identification).

In the nervous system, GAS6 is a growth factor for human Schwann cells, promoting their proliferation through the Axl/Rse family of tyrosine kinase receptors. This interaction leads to the activation of signaling pathways, such as the ras/raf/MEK pathway, which are crucial for cell proliferation and survival (Li1996Identification). GAS6 is also involved in modulating microglial phagocytosis and inflammatory gene expression, reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and promoting an anti-inflammatory environment (Grommes2007Regulation).

GAS6 is expressed in various tissues, including neurons, where it is particularly noted in the ventral horn of the spinal cord and larger neuronal cell bodies, indicating its role in nervous system function and repair (Li1996Identification).

## Clinical Significance
GAS6 (growth arrest-specific 6) is implicated in various diseases due to its role in cell proliferation, survival, and migration through interactions with TAM receptors (Tyro3, Axl, and Mer). In cancer, GAS6 is overexpressed in several malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where it is associated with poor prognosis and chemoresistance. High GAS6 expression in AML patients correlates with lower complete remission rates and shorter disease-free and overall survival (Yang2019Expression; Whitman2013GAS6). GAS6 also contributes to cancer metastasis by promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), enhancing cancer cell invasion and migration (Wu2018Targeting).

In autoimmune diseases, alterations in the TAM-GAS6/PS pathway are linked to conditions like Behçet's disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis. These alterations affect immune homeostasis and apoptotic cell clearance, contributing to chronic inflammation (Qin2016Analysis). In multiple sclerosis, the GAS6/Axl signaling pathway is involved in protecting oligodendrocytes and promoting remyelination, but its dysregulation can lead to demyelination and lesion formation (Di2020Therapeutic).

GAS6 is also associated with fibrotic conditions and COVID-19, where its elevated levels correlate with disease severity and fibrosis, particularly in the lungs (Rizzi2023Gas6TAM).

## Interactions
GAS6 (growth arrest-specific 6) is a protein that interacts with receptor tyrosine kinases, particularly AXL, Rse, and Mer, which are part of the TAM receptor family. GAS6 acts as a ligand for these receptors, with its G domains being crucial for binding and activating Rse and AXL receptors (Mark1996Characterization). The interaction between GAS6 and AXL is characterized by high affinity and involves specific contacts that are essential for receptor activation. The major contact site involves interactions between LG1 of GAS6 and IG1 of AXL, forming a continuous beta-sheet across the interface (Sasaki2005Structural). This interaction leads to the formation of a 2:2 Gas6/Axl signaling complex, which is crucial for effective transmembrane signaling (Sasaki2005Structural).

GAS6 also interacts with the Mer receptor, activating downstream signaling pathways that influence cell survival, proliferation, and migration (Wu2017Molecular). These interactions are implicated in various cellular processes, including tumorigenesis and cancer progression, by activating pathways such as PI3K/Akt, MAPK/ERK, and STAT3 (Wu2017Molecular; Zhai2023Gas6AXL). The GAS6/AXL pathway is particularly significant in cancer, influencing tumor cell proliferation, migration, and survival (Zhai2023Gas6AXL).
