# ST3GAL4

## Overview
ST3GAL4 is a gene that encodes the enzyme ST3 beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase 4, which is a member of the sialyltransferase family of enzymes. This enzyme is primarily involved in the sialylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids, a critical post-translational modification process that affects various biological functions, including cell-cell interactions, immune responses, and cellular signaling. ST3 beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase 4 is predominantly active in the Golgi apparatus, where it catalyzes the transfer of sialic acid to galactose-containing substrates, contributing to the formation of sialyl-Lewis X, a key ligand for selectins involved in immune cell recruitment (Kitano2021Rab11mediated). The enzyme's activity is essential for maintaining proper glycan structures, influencing processes such as cell adhesion and cancer progression (Gomes2013Expression). Alterations in ST3GAL4 expression or function have been linked to various clinical conditions, including cardiac arrhythmias, thrombocytopenia, and Brugada Syndrome, highlighting its significance in human health and disease (MarínQuílez2023Inherited; Ghiroldi2022Alterations; Ednie2013Expression).

## Structure
The ST3GAL4 gene encodes the enzyme ST3 beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase 4, which is involved in the sialylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids. The primary structure of ST3GAL4 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the polypeptide chain. The enzyme contains specific domains, including the sialyltransferase domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Uslupehlivan2019Computational).

The secondary structure of ST3GAL4 includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which contribute to the overall folding and stability of the protein. The tertiary structure is characterized by the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is stabilized by interactions such as disulfide bonds. These structural features are essential for the enzyme's function and its ability to interact with substrates and other molecules (OrtizSoto2019Structural).

ST3GAL4 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which can affect its activity and stability. The enzyme is also subject to alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that may have distinct structural and functional properties (Kitano2021Rab11mediated). These structural characteristics are important for understanding the enzyme's role in biological processes and its potential implications in diseases.

## Function
ST3GAL4 encodes the enzyme ST3 beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase 4, which plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of sialylated glycoconjugates. This enzyme is primarily active in the Golgi apparatus, where it catalyzes the transfer of sialic acid to galactose-containing substrates, contributing to the modification of glycoproteins and glycolipids (Kitano2021Rab11mediated). The enzyme is involved in the production of sialyl-Lewis X (sLeX), a terminal tetrasaccharide epitope that serves as a ligand for selectins, which are important for the recruitment of immune cells, highlighting its role in immunity (Kitano2021Rab11mediated).

ST3GAL4 is also implicated in the regulation of α2,3-sialylation of N-glycans, which is essential for various cellular functions, including cell adhesion and signaling. It specifically modifies glycoproteins such as β1 integrin, affecting cellular signaling pathways (Qi2019ST3GAL3). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining proper glycan structures, which are important for cell-cell interactions and immune responses (Kitano2021Rab11mediated). Rab11-mediated transport is essential for the proper localization and function of ST3GAL4, as Rab11 knockdown results in the accumulation of ST3GAL4 in the Golgi, affecting the levels of α2,3-sialylated N-glycans (Kitano2021Rab11mediated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ST3GAL4 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In cardiac function, the deletion of ST3GAL4 affects voltage-gated sodium channel activity, leading to changes in ventricular excitability and increased susceptibility to arrhythmias such as tachycardia and fibrillation. This is attributed to reduced sialylation of Na v channels, impacting their gating properties and shortening the refractory period in cardiac myocytes (Ednie2013Expression).

In the context of inherited thrombocytopenia, alterations in ST3GAL4 are associated with increased platelet clearance and thrombocytopenia, as observed in ST3Gal-IV knockout mice. This is due to desialylation, which leads to rapid platelet clearance by liver macrophages and hepatocytes (MarínQuílez2023Inherited).

ST3GAL4 is also linked to Brugada Syndrome, an arrhythmogenic disorder. Downregulation of ST3GAL4 correlates with reduced function of voltage-gated sodium channels, contributing to cardiac dysfunctions observed in the syndrome (Ghiroldi2022Alterations).

Additionally, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ST3GAL4 have been associated with variations in von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels and factor VIII activity, potentially influencing bleeding disorders (Song2016Association).

## Interactions
ST3GAL4 is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function in glycosylation and cellular processes. It interacts with other sialyltransferases and glycosyltransferases, forming complexes that are crucial for its enzymatic activities. In particular, ST3GAL4 shares physical interactions with genes such as CB8B, FAM213A, and PCSK1N, with CB8B showing the highest confidence score, suggesting a potential functional relationship in certain biological contexts (Chukwudozie2020The).

ST3GAL4 is also involved in the modification of specific proteins, such as the integrin β1 subunit, which is important for cell adhesion and signaling. This interaction is specific, as ST3GAL4 significantly contributes to the α2,3-sialylation of integrin β1, affecting cellular signaling pathways (Qi2019ST3GAL3). The enzyme competes with ST6Gal1 for sialylation of target proteins, influencing the levels of α2,6-sialylation and impacting cell adhesion and proliferation (Gu2024Specific).

In the context of cancer, ST3GAL4 expression leads to the production of sialyl-Lewis X antigens, which are associated with the activation of the c-Met receptor and its downstream targets, including FAK and Src proteins. This activation enhances the invasive phenotype of cancer cells, highlighting the role of ST3GAL4 in cancer progression (Gomes2013Expression).
