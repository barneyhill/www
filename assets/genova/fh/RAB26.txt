# RAB26

## Overview
RAB26 is a gene that encodes a member of the RAS oncogene family, specifically a small GTPase protein involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking. The RAB26 protein plays a pivotal role in the transport and maturation of secretory granules and vesicles, particularly in exocrine cells and neurons. It is crucial for the formation and function of secretory granules in MIST1-expressing cells and is implicated in synaptic vesicle trafficking and recycling by linking these vesicles to the autophagy pathway. Additionally, RAB26 modulates the cell surface transport of α2-adrenergic receptors, influencing receptor availability and signaling. The protein's interactions with various partners, such as Atg16L1 and synaptotagmin-1, underscore its involvement in vesicle-mediated secretion and autophagy pathways (Zhuang2023Rab26; Li2012Rab26; Binotti2015The).

## Function
RAB26 is a small GTPase involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking, playing a crucial role in the transport and maturation of secretory granules and vesicles. In exocrine cells, RAB26 is essential for the formation and maturation of secretory granules, particularly in MIST1-expressing cells, where it regulates the size and function of these granules. The presence of RAB26 leads to the formation of larger granules, which are vital for efficient secretion processes (Tian2010RAB26).

In neurons, RAB26 is associated with synaptic vesicles and is implicated in linking these vesicles to the autophagy pathway. It is enriched in synaptic vesicle clusters and interacts with autophagy-related proteins, suggesting a role in synaptic vesicle trafficking and recycling. This function may contribute to synaptic turnover and remodeling, as RAB26 directs vesicles into pre-autophagosomal structures, potentially facilitating their degradation (Binotti2015The).

RAB26 also modulates the cell surface transport of α2-adrenergic receptors from the Golgi apparatus, influencing receptor availability and signaling. This process is crucial for the proper functioning of G protein-coupled receptors, impacting cellular communication and response (Li2012Rab26).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RAB26 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly diabetes and cancer. In the context of diabetes, RAB26 is shown to negatively regulate insulin secretion by sequestering synaptotagmin-1, which inhibits the exocytosis of insulin granules. Overexpression of RAB26 in mouse islets leads to reduced insulin secretion and impaired glucose homeostasis, suggesting a potential link to diabetes mellitus (Zhuang2023Rab26). Elevated RAB26 levels have been observed in diabetic conditions, indicating its role in the pathophysiology of diabetes (Zhuang2023Rab26).

In cancer, RAB26 expression is associated with tumor progression and patient survival. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), RAB26 acts as an oncogene, with higher expression levels correlating with lower overall survival rates. It mediates the tumorigenic effects of SNRPB, promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Liu2019SNRPB). Conversely, in breast cancer, RAB26 suppresses cell migration and invasion by facilitating the autophagic degradation of phosphorylated Src kinase, suggesting a protective role against cancer progression (Liu2021Rab26). These findings highlight the dual role of RAB26 in different cancer types, acting as both an oncogene and a tumor suppressor depending on the context.

## Interactions
Rab26, a member of the RAS oncogene family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in intracellular vesicle trafficking. Rab26 interacts with the core autophagy protein Atg16L1, particularly in its GTP-bound form, suggesting a role in forming pre-autophagosomal structures. This interaction is weaker compared to Rab33B, indicating it might be transient or require additional factors for stabilization (Binotti2015The). Rab26 also interacts with synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1), binding to its C2A domain in a GTP-dependent manner. This interaction is crucial for Rab26's role in restricting insulin secretion by sequestering Syt1, which prevents the formation of the SNARE complex necessary for insulin granule docking and fusion (Zhuang2023Rab26).

Rab26 is involved in the transport of α2-adrenergic receptors (α2-ARs) from the Golgi to the cell surface. It interacts directly and activation-dependently with the α2B-adrenergic receptor, particularly with the third intracellular loop of the receptor, facilitating its post-Golgi traffic (Li2012Rab26). These interactions highlight Rab26's role in modulating vesicle-mediated secretion and autophagy pathways.
