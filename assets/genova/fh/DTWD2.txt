# DTWD2

## Overview
DTWD2 is a gene that encodes the protein DTW domain containing 2, which plays a critical role in the post-transcriptional modification of transfer RNA (tRNA) in eukaryotic cells. The DTWD2 protein is involved in the biogenesis of aminocarboxypropyluridine (acp3U), a modification essential for tRNA stability and efficient protein translation (Takakura2019Biogenesis). This protein is categorized as a tRNA-modifying enzyme and is implicated in the biosynthesis of glycoRNA, where it serves as an attachment site for N-glycans on tRNA (Xie2023The). DTWD2 interacts with other proteins through its PDZ-binding motifs, suggesting a role in specific protein-protein interactions (Chimura2011Evolutionarily). The gene produces two isoforms, DTWD2L and DTWD2S, which localize to the cytoplasm and nucleus, respectively, indicating that acp3U formation occurs in both cellular compartments (Takakura2019Biogenesis). The loss of DTWD2 function can lead to mitochondrial diseases and other RNA modopathies, highlighting its clinical significance (Takakura2019Biogenesis).

## Function
The DTWD2 gene encodes a protein involved in the biogenesis of aminocarboxypropyluridine (acp3U) in tRNA, a modification crucial for maintaining tRNA stability and function. In human cells, DTWD2 is responsible for the formation of acp3U at position 20a in specific tRNAs, such as those for Asn(GTT), Ile(AAT), and Ile(TAT) (Takakura2019Biogenesis). This modification is essential for efficient protein translation and normal cell growth, as its absence leads to slow growth in cultured human cells (Funk2020Identification).

DTWD2 produces two isoforms through alternative splicing: DTWD2L and DTWD2S. DTWD2L is primarily active in the cytoplasm, while DTWD2S is concentrated in the nucleus, suggesting that acp3U formation occurs in both locations (Takakura2019Biogenesis). The protein's activity is linked to the inhibition of D20(a) formation, indicating its role in maintaining proper tRNA modification (Takakura2019Biogenesis).

The DTWD2 protein is also implicated in the biosynthesis of glycoRNA, serving as an attachment site for N-glycans on tRNA, which may play a role in cellular glycosylation processes (Xie2023The). The loss of DTWD2 function can lead to pathological consequences, including mitochondrial diseases and other RNA modopathies (Takakura2019Biogenesis).

## Interactions
DTWD2 is known to interact with the PDZ protein GRIP1 through its type-II PDZ-binding motifs. These motifs, specifically N-x-V-x-I, x-S-V-x-I, and x-x-V-K-I, are essential for the binding interaction, indicating that DTWD2 engages in specific protein-protein interactions mediated by these motifs (Chimura2011Evolutionarily).

While the context does not provide detailed information on direct physical interactions of DTWD2 with nucleic acids, it suggests a potential role in RNA processing. The DTWD2 protein family is associated with zinc-chelating domains and inactive versions of the 3 â†’ 5 exonuclease domain, which may function as RNA-binding domains. This implies that DTWD2 might interact with different RNAs, possibly functioning as an RNase (Burroughs2014Analysis).

DTWD2 is also implicated in the formation of acp3U modifications on tRNA in eukaryotes, such as Drosophila melanogaster and Arabidopsis thaliana. This modification process involves specific residues within the DTW domain, crucial for its catalytic activity, although specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids in this context are not detailed (Funk2020Identification; Takakura2019Biogenesis).
