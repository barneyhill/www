# TBC1D3G

## Overview
TBC1D3G is a gene located on chromosome 17q12, encoding the protein TBC1 domain family member 3G. This protein is part of the TBC1 domain family, which is known for its role in regulating intracellular trafficking and signaling pathways. TBC1D3G functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rab family proteins, specifically RAB5, which is involved in endocytosis and vesicle trafficking. This suggests that TBC1D3G plays a significant role in modulating cellular processes related to GTPase activity (DiezFuertes2022Transcriptomic; Wang2021TBC1D3). The gene is characterized by high sequence similarity with other family members, complicating its identification through mass spectrometry (Siddiqui2018Chromosome). TBC1D3G has been implicated in immune modulation and cell proliferation, with expression linked to immune cell infiltration, particularly in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), where it may serve as a prognostic biomarker (Wang2021TBC1D3).

## Function
TBC1D3G is a member of the TBC1 domain family, which is involved in regulating intracellular trafficking and signaling pathways. Proteins in this family often function as GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) for Rab family proteins, which are crucial for vesicle transport and membrane trafficking processes in cells (Siddiqui2018Chromosome). Specifically, TBC1D3G acts as a GAP for RAB5, a protein involved in endocytosis and vesicle trafficking, suggesting its role in modulating cellular processes related to GTPase activity (DiezFuertes2022Transcriptomic; Wang2021TBC1D3).

TBC1D3G is located on chromosome 17, specifically at 17q12, and is part of a gene family characterized by high sequence similarity, which complicates its identification through mass spectrometry (Siddiqui2018Chromosome). Despite these challenges, TBC1D3G has been identified through yeast two-hybrid assays, showing interactions with multiple proteins, including ZRANB1, suggesting a potential role in cellular processes involving this protein (Siddiqui2018Chromosome).

The TBC1D3 family, including TBC1D3G, is associated with immune modulation and cell proliferation, with expression linked to immune cell infiltration, particularly CD4+ T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells (Wang2021TBC1D3).

## Clinical Significance
TBC1D3G, a member of the TBC1 domain family, has been implicated in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC). Studies have shown that the expression of TBC1D3G is associated with immune infiltration, particularly affecting CD4+ T cells and B cells, and is linked with immune inhibitors such as IL10RB and PVRL2 (Wang2021TBC1D3). The expression of TBC1D3G is positively correlated with immune checkpoints like CD160, CTLA4, and PDCD1, which are significant in cancer immunotherapy (Wang2021TBC1D3). High expression levels of TBC1D3G and other TBC1D3 family members are associated with poor prognosis in KIRC, suggesting that TBC1D3G expression could serve as a prognostic biomarker for this type of cancer (Wang2021TBC1D3). However, the study notes that some data show contradictory results, indicating the need for further investigation to confirm these findings (Wang2021TBC1D3). The potential role of TBC1D3G in promoting KIRC development may involve interactions with microtubules, although specific details about mutations or expression alterations in TBC1D3G are not provided (Wang2021TBC1D3).
