# NLRX1

## Overview
NLRX1 is a gene that encodes the NLR family member X1 protein, a member of the NOD-like receptor (NLR) family, which plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses and maintaining cellular homeostasis. The NLRX1 protein is characterized as a multi-domain protein that localizes to the mitochondria, where it functions as a negative regulator of inflammation and antiviral signaling. It achieves this by interacting with key signaling molecules such as MAVS and TRAF6, thereby inhibiting pathways like NF-κB and type I interferon production (Xia2011NLRX1; Moore2008NLRX1). Additionally, NLRX1 is involved in the regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and autophagy, contributing to processes such as apoptosis and metabolic regulation (NagaiSinger2019NLRX1). Alterations in NLRX1 expression have been linked to various diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, multiple sclerosis, and colorectal cancer, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Gharagozloo2019NLRX1; Kang2015Suppression; Soares2014The).

## Structure
The NLRX1 protein is a ubiquitously expressed, highly conserved multi-domain protein consisting of 975 amino acids. It features an N-terminal mitochondria-targeting sequence (MTS), a central nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NOD), and a C-terminal putative ligand-binding and regulatory leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain (Singh2018NLRX1). The N-terminal domain is crucial for mitochondrial localization, as it facilitates the translocation of NLRX1 to the mitochondrial matrix, where it undergoes maturation by mitochondrial processing peptidases (MPPs) (Arnoult2009An).

The LRR domain of NLRX1 is involved in protein-protein interactions and is crucial for its RNA binding capability and interaction with other mitochondrial proteins (Singh2018NLRX1). The structure of the LRR domain has been studied in the context of its therapeutic potential, showing that it maintains structural integrity when conjugated with other peptides (Koo2020LRR).

NLRX1 does not have a predicted transmembrane domain, distinguishing it from other mitochondrial outer membrane proteins. It is associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane and is resistant to trypsin digestion, indicating its localization within the mitochondrial matrix (Arnoult2009An). The protein's interaction with UQCRC2, a component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, suggests a role in modulating reactive oxygen species pathways (Arnoult2009An).

## Function
NLRX1 is a member of the NOD-like receptor (NLR) family and functions as a negative regulator of inflammation and antiviral signaling in healthy human cells. It is primarily localized to the mitochondrial outer membrane, where it interacts with the mitochondrial antiviral signaling adaptor MAVS. This interaction inhibits the production of type I interferons by preventing MAVS-mediated IRF3 dimer formation, thus modulating the immune response to viral infections (Fekete2021Focusing; Moore2008NLRX1).

NLRX1 also plays a role in regulating the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is crucial for inflammatory responses. It interacts with TRAF6 and the IKK complex to inhibit NF-κB activation, thereby reducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Xia2011NLRX1). This regulation helps maintain immune homeostasis and prevents excessive inflammation, which can lead to conditions such as bacterial sepsis and autoimmune diseases (Allen2011NLRX1).

Additionally, NLRX1 is involved in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and modulates autophagy, cell death, and proliferation. It acts as a scaffolding protein, facilitating the formation of multiprotein complexes, and is involved in processes such as apoptosis and metabolic regulation (Tattoli2008NLRX1; NagaiSinger2019NLRX1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NLRX1 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), NLRX1 expression is significantly decreased, correlating with disease severity, reduced pulmonary function, and poor quality of life. This suppression is linked to increased inflammation and alveolar destruction, with cigarette smoke exposure further inhibiting NLRX1 expression (Kang2015Suppression). In the context of multiple sclerosis (MS) and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), NLRX1 deficiency is associated with increased CNS inflammation and demyelination. NLRX1 mutations, such as the p.Glu192Ter mutation, have been identified in MS patients, suggesting a genetic susceptibility linked to the disease (Gharagozloo2019NLRX1).

NLRX1 also plays a role in colorectal cancer (CRC), where its deficiency leads to increased susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis and AOM/DSS-induced carcinogenesis. NLRX1-deficient mice exhibit more severe histopathological damage and higher tumor burden compared to wild-type mice (Soares2014The). In renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), loss of NLRX1 results in increased mitochondrial oxidative stress and apoptosis, indicating its protective role against tissue injury (Stokman2017NLRX1). These findings highlight the clinical significance of NLRX1 in various inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, as well as its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
NLRX1 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in immune response regulation. It interacts with TRAF6 and the IKK complex, composed of IKKa, IKKb, and NEMO, to negatively regulate NF-kB signaling. NLRX1 binds to TRAF6 in unstimulated cells, but this interaction dissipates following LPS stimulation, suggesting a dynamic interaction that shifts to the IKK complex upon cellular activation (Xia2011NLRX1).

NLRX1 also interacts with MAVS, a crucial adaptor protein for antiviral signaling, at the mitochondrial outer membrane. This interaction inhibits MAVS-induced interferon signaling, acting as a negative regulator within the intracellular antiviral pathway (Moore2008NLRX1). NLRX1 forms a multiprotein complex with MAVS, competing with RIG-I/MDA5 binding to MAVS, which prevents MAVS from producing interferons (NagaiSinger2019NLRX1).

In the context of influenza virus infection, NLRX1 interacts with the viral PB1-F2 protein, forming a complex in mitochondria. This interaction enhances type I interferon production in macrophages by protecting them from PB1-F2-mediated apoptosis (Jaworska2014NLRX1).

NLRX1 also interacts with UQCRC2, a component of the mitochondrial bc1 complex, suggesting a role in modulating ROS-dependent pathways (Arnoult2009An).
