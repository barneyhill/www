# NUCKS1

## Overview
NUCKS1 is a gene that encodes the nuclear protein known as nuclear casein kinase and cyclin-dependent kinase substrate 1. This protein is categorized as an intrinsically disordered protein, characterized by its high hydrophilicity and lack of well-defined secondary structure elements, which allows it to participate in a variety of cellular processes (Wiśniewski2008Constitutive). NUCKS1 is involved in maintaining genome stability and facilitating DNA repair, particularly through homologous recombination, a critical pathway for repairing DNA double-strand breaks (Parplys2015NUCKS1). The protein is subject to extensive post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which is crucial for its function in the DNA damage response (Grundt2017Identification). NUCKS1 is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues and plays a significant role in cellular homeostasis, influencing processes such as chromatin structure regulation and gene activity (Wiśniewski2008Constitutive). Its clinical significance is underscored by its association with various cancers and potential as a biomarker for disease prognosis (Kikuchi2012Identification; Ma2021Upregulation).

## Structure
NUCKS1 is a nuclear protein characterized by its high hydrophilicity and lack of well-defined secondary structure elements, making it an intrinsically disordered protein (Wiśniewski2008Constitutive). The protein is highly charged, with 50% of its composition consisting of charged residues, and it shares properties with high mobility group proteins, which are involved in regulating chromatin structure and gene activity (Wiśniewski2008Constitutive). NUCKS1 contains a conserved DNA-binding domain known as the AT-hook domain, which is common in the HMGA family and can alter DNA conformation by unbending intrinsically bent DNA (Wiśniewski2008Constitutive).

NUCKS1 is subject to extensive post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, and formylation. Phosphorylation is particularly prominent, with 91% of its serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues being phosphorylated in human cells (Grundt2017Identification). The protein is phosphorylated at multiple sites, with CK2 and ATM kinase identified as kinases responsible for some of these modifications (Grundt2017Identification). The phosphorylation pattern of NUCKS1 changes with the cell cycle, affecting its function and interactions (Grundt2017Identification). NUCKS1 also contains nuclear localization signals, which are crucial for its import into the nucleus, interacting with importin α3 and α5 (Grundt2007Identification).

## Function
NUCKS1 is a nuclear protein that plays a critical role in maintaining genome stability and facilitating DNA repair processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in homologous recombination (HR), a key pathway for repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and ensuring chromosomal integrity. NUCKS1 depletion leads to impaired HR, increased chromatid breaks, and heightened sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, indicating its essential role in DNA repair and replication fork progression (Parplys2015NUCKS1).

NUCKS1 is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues and is considered a housekeeping gene, reflecting its fundamental role in cellular processes. It is phosphorylated in response to DNA damage, which is crucial for its function in the DNA damage response and HR pathway (Parplys2015NUCKS1). The protein is associated with chromatin and influences DNA replication by maintaining proper elongation rates and replication origin firing, which is vital for efficient recovery from replication stress (Parplys2015NUCKS1).

NUCKS1's involvement in these molecular processes underscores its importance in preserving genomic integrity and cellular homeostasis, making it a significant factor in the prevention of genomic instability and related diseases (Parplys2015NUCKS1).

## Clinical Significance
NUCKS1 is implicated in various cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC), where its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and aggressive tumor features. High NUCKS1 expression in CRC correlates with lower overall survival rates and is linked to tumor depth, lymphatic and venous invasion, and lymph node metastasis (Kikuchi2012Identification). It is considered an independent prognostic factor for relapse-free survival in CRC patients, particularly in stages II and III, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for predicting post-operative recurrence and guiding treatment decisions (Kikuchi2012Identification).

In lung adenocarcinoma, NUCKS1 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis, including lower overall and disease-free survival rates, making it a potential biomarker for this cancer type (Ma2021Upregulation). NUCKS1 is also overexpressed in gastric cancer, where it promotes tumor growth and cell proliferation while suppressing autophagy through the mTOR-Beclin1 pathway (Zhao2020NUCKS).

Beyond cancer, NUCKS1 is linked to metabolic diseases and inflammatory immune conditions. It plays a role in insulin metabolism and is involved in the DNA damage response, particularly in homologous recombination, which is crucial for maintaining genome stability (Parplys2015NUCKS1).

## Interactions
NUCKS1 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It is a paralog of RAD51AP1 and is involved in homologous recombination (HR) for DNA repair. NUCKS1 does not directly interact with the RAD51 recombinase, unlike RAD51AP1, suggesting a different role in the HR pathway (Parplys2015NUCKS1). NUCKS1 is phosphorylated by ATM or ATR kinases in response to DNA damage, indicating its involvement in the DNA damage response (Parplys2015NUCKS1).

NUCKS1 also interacts with the HIV-1 Tat protein, enhancing Tat-mediated transcription of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR). This interaction is crucial for HIV-1 replication, as NUCKS1 facilitates the accumulation of Tat in the transactivation-responsive (TAR) region on the LTR (Kim2014NUCKS1). NUCKS1 does not affect Tat's nuclear localization or its interaction with Cyclin T1, but it enhances Tat-TAR interactions, promoting viral transcription (Kim2014NUCKS1).

In the context of cell cycle regulation, NUCKS1 binds to the SKP2 promoter via a GC-box, influencing the degradation of CDK inhibitors p21 and p27, which is essential for S phase entry (Hume2021The). These interactions highlight NUCKS1's multifaceted role in cellular processes and disease mechanisms.
