# SNX6

## Overview
SNX6, or sorting nexin 6, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in intracellular trafficking and membrane dynamics. The protein, sorting nexin 6, is a member of the sorting nexin family, characterized by the presence of a Phox homology (PX) domain and a Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain, which are crucial for its role in phosphoinositide binding, membrane association, and remodeling (Okada2010Proteomic; Teasdale2011Insights). SNX6 is involved in the retrograde transport of transmembrane cargo from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network as part of the retromer complex, and it plays a significant role in the transport and incorporation of lamin A into the nuclear envelope (GonzálezGranado2014Sorting; Rivera2010Sorting). The protein interacts with various cellular components, including the TGF-β receptor family and the dynactin subunit p150 Glued, influencing signaling pathways and cellular transport mechanisms (Hong2009The; Rivera2010Sorting). SNX6 has been implicated in cancer progression, particularly in pancreatic and breast cancers, where it may serve as a prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target (Rivera2010Sorting; Hu2018SNX6).

## Structure
Sorting nexin 6 (SNX6) is a member of the sorting nexin family characterized by the presence of a PX (Phox homology) domain at its N-terminus and a BAR (Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs) domain at its C-terminal region. The PX domain is crucial for phosphoinositide binding and membrane association, while the BAR domain is involved in membrane remodeling and sensing (Okada2010Proteomic; Teasdale2011Insights). SNX6 also contains multiple coiled-coil domains within its large C-terminal region, which are potential sites for protein-protein interactions (TEASDALE2001A).

The PX domain of SNX6 is involved in interactions with other proteins, such as the cytoplasmic tails of TGF-β receptor family members, and can drive association with the oncogene Pim-1, leading to SNX6 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation (Teasdale2011Insights). SNX6 forms heteromeric complexes with other sorting nexins, such as SNX1, and is involved in endosome-to-Golgi retrieval processes (Teasdale2011Insights).

SNX6 interacts with the bacterial effector protein IncE through a unique helical hairpin structure in its PX domain, which is essential for binding (Sun2017Structural). The protein is expressed in various tissues, including neurons in the mammalian brain, and is localized to early endosomes (Okada2010Proteomic; TEASDALE2001A).

## Function
Sorting nexin 6 (SNX6) is a protein involved in intracellular trafficking, particularly in the transport and incorporation of lamin A into the nuclear envelope in mammalian cells. SNX6 facilitates the trafficking of lamin A from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the nucleus, enhancing its synthesis and integration into the nuclear envelope through a Ran-dependent mechanism. This process is crucial for maintaining nuclear lamina homeostasis, which is essential for the structural integrity and function of the nuclear envelope (GonzálezGranado2014Sorting).

SNX6 interacts with lamin A both in vitro and in vivo, linking it to the outer surface of the ER during its transport to the nucleus. Overexpression of SNX6 increases lamin A/C protein levels and their accumulation in the nuclear envelope without affecting mRNA levels or degradation, suggesting a role in enhancing lamin A transport or translation (GonzálezGranado2014Sorting).

SNX6 is also involved in the retrograde transport of transmembrane cargo from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network as part of the retromer complex. It interacts with various proteins, including the TGF-β receptor family, and can modulate signaling pathways, such as those involved in metastasis (Rivera2010Sorting).

## Clinical Significance
SNX6 (sorting nexin 6) has been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer, due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In pancreatic cancer, SNX6 is frequently upregulated and associated with poor prognosis. High SNX6 expression correlates with shorter overall survival and is linked to the promotion of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process crucial for cancer metastasis. This suggests that SNX6 could serve as a prognostic marker and a potential therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer (Hu2018SNX6).

SNX6 also interacts with the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway, which is involved in cancer progression. It is part of the Retromer complex, which mediates intracellular trafficking and receptor signaling alterations, contributing to tumorigenesis (Rivera2010Sorting; Yang2020Sorting).

In breast cancer, SNX6 interacts with Breast Cancer Metastasis Suppressor 1 (BRMS1), enhancing transcriptional repression and potentially affecting metastasis suppression. This interaction suggests a role for SNX6 in modulating gene expression related to cancer progression (Rivera2010Sorting).

Alterations in SNX6 expression or function may also impact other diseases, but specific clinical implications require further research.

## Interactions
Sorting nexin 6 (SNX6) is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in intracellular trafficking and signaling pathways. SNX6 is a component of the retromer complex and interacts with SNX1 and SNX2, which are crucial for its recruitment to endosomal membranes. This interaction is dependent on phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P) and is essential for the retrograde transport of cargo from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) (Hong2009The).

SNX6 also interacts with the dynactin subunit p150 Glued, a part of the dynein/dynactin motor complex, facilitating the transport of cargoes within the cell (Hong2009The). The interaction with p150 Glued is enhanced even when SNX6's membrane association is disrupted, indicating that membrane binding is not necessary for this interaction (Hong2009The).

In addition to its role in trafficking, SNX6 interacts with breast cancer metastasis suppressor-1 (BRMS1), promoting transcriptional repression. This interaction occurs in both the nucleus and cytoplasm and does not require the PX domain of SNX6 (Rivera2010Sorting).

SNX6 also interacts with GIT1, enhancing the degradation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by facilitating its transport to lysosomes (Cavet2008An).
