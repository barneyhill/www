# PRG2

## Overview
PRG2 is a gene that encodes the protein proteoglycan 2, also known as eosinophil major basic protein-1 (MBP-1), which is a critical component of eosinophil granules. This protein is characterized by its highly cationic nature, primarily due to its amino acid composition, which includes a high number of arginine residues. MBP-1 plays a significant role in the immune response, particularly in the storage and release of granules from eosinophils upon activation. Structurally, MBP-1 features a C-type lectin domain and forms intragranular nanocrystals within eosinophils, which are crucial for its function in immune processes (Wasmoen1988Biochemical; Yang2024In). The PRG2 gene is also involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes, including interactions with PTEN, affecting the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, and forming complexes with other PRG family members, which are important for neuronal development (Brosig2019The; brosig2018analysis).

## Structure
The PRG2 gene encodes the human eosinophil major basic protein-1 (MBP-1), which is a component of eosinophil granules. The primary structure of MBP-1 is characterized by a high isoelectric point due to the presence of numerous arginine residues and a scarcity of carboxylic acid-containing residues, contributing to its highly cationic nature (Wasmoen1988Biochemical). The secondary structure predominantly consists of beta-sheets, with little alpha-helix content, and the protein likely exists as an extended molecule with a cationic surface (Wasmoen1988Biochemical).

The tertiary structure of MBP-1 includes a C-type lectin domain architecture, comprising two α-helices and seven β-strands forming three anti-parallel β-sheets. This structure is stabilized by two disulfide bonds and features a calcium-mediated carbohydrate binding region (Yang2024In). The protein's surface potential is highly positive, consistent with its basic nature (Yang2024In).

MBP-1 forms intragranular nanocrystals within eosinophils, which are released upon cell activation. These nanocrystals exhibit a pseudocrystalline nature and are stabilized by specific loop configurations and cis-proline-aromatic interactions (Soragni2015Toxicity; Yang2024In). The protein's structure is crucial for its storage and release functions in immune responses.

## Interactions
PRG2, also known as LPPR3, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with PTEN, a lipid phosphatase, through a direct binding mechanism confirmed by mass spectrometry and co-immunoprecipitation in rat brain lysates and neuron cultures (Brosig2019The; brosig2018analysis). This interaction is significant as PRG2 can sequester PTEN to the plasma membrane and inhibit its phosphatase activity, affecting PI(3,4,5)P3 levels and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (Brosig2019The). 

PRG2 also forms higher-order complexes, potentially as dimers or trimers, through its transmembrane domains, independent of its C-terminal tail (brosig2018analysis). It can self-associate and interact with other PRG family members, such as PRG3 and PRG5, forming heteromeric complexes (brosig2018analysis). These interactions are crucial for its role in axonal branching and neuronal development, as PRG2's interaction with PTEN is enhanced by growth factors like BDNF, which are known to induce axonal branching (brosig2018analysis).
