# DGKH

## Overview
Diacylglycerol kinase eta (DGKH) is a gene that encodes the enzyme diacylglycerol kinase eta, a member of the diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) family, which plays a pivotal role in lipid signaling pathways. As a type II diacylglycerol kinase, the protein is characterized by specific structural domains, including a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, which are integral to its function and subcellular localization (Shulga2011Regulation; Shirai2014Diacylglycerol). The enzyme is involved in the phosphorylation of diacylglycerol (DAG) to produce phosphatidic acid (PA), both of which are critical lipid second messengers in various cellular processes (Kume2016The). DGKH is implicated in several intracellular signaling pathways, including the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor pathway, and is associated with psychiatric disorders such as bipolar disorder, as well as certain cancers like acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Kume2016The; Gravina2023Role).

## Structure
DGKH, or diacylglycerol kinase eta, is a type II diacylglycerol kinase characterized by specific structural domains. It contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain near the N-terminus and a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain at the C-terminus, which are typical of type II DGKs (Shulga2011Regulation; Shirai2014Diacylglycerol). The PH domain is involved in subcellular localization, while the SAM domain is crucial for oligomerization, potentially affecting the enzyme's localization and function (Sakai2012Recent). DGKH also includes two cysteine-rich C1 domains, which are homologous to the DAG-binding motifs found in protein kinase C isoforms, although not all DGK C1 domains bind DAG (Shulga2011Regulation).

DGKH undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms, including DGKη1 and DGKη2. DGKη1 is more widely expressed and has higher specific activity compared to DGKη2, which contains a SAM domain that negatively regulates its activity (Shulga2011Regulation). Another splice variant, DGKη3, is specifically expressed in the testis and lacks exon 26, which encodes a 31-amino acid sequence (Shionoya2015Distinct). These structural features and splice variants contribute to the functional diversity of DGKH in cellular signaling pathways.

## Function
Diacylglycerol kinase eta (DGKH) is an enzyme that plays a significant role in lipid signaling by phosphorylating diacylglycerol (DAG) to produce phosphatidic acid (PA), both of which are crucial lipid second messengers involved in various cellular processes. DGKH is particularly important in the regulation of intracellular signaling pathways, such as the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor pathway, where it modulates the Ras/B-Raf/C-Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade. This regulation is vital for cellular responses to growth factors, affecting processes like cell growth and differentiation (Kume2016The).

DGKH contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that strongly and selectively binds to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), which is essential for its translocation to the plasma membrane and its function as a cellular PI(4,5)P2 sensor. This binding activity is crucial for the enzyme's role in membrane localization and signal transduction pathways (Kume2016The).

In healthy human cells, DGKH is active in the cytoplasm and associated with the plasma membrane, where it influences cellular responses to external stimuli. Its activity is implicated in maintaining the balance between DAG and PA, impacting several signal transduction proteins and cellular processes (Sakane2020New).

## Clinical Significance
The DGKH gene has been implicated in several psychiatric disorders, most notably bipolar disorder. Genome-wide association studies have suggested a potential link between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the DGKH gene and bipolar disorder. This association was replicated at the haplotype level in a Sardinian sample, although it was not confirmed for individual SNPs (Shulga2011Regulation). Additionally, individuals with bipolar disorder have been found to exhibit a 25% increase in DGKH gene expression compared to controls, although this increase was not significantly different from that observed in individuals with schizophrenia, indicating that the elevated expression might not be specific to bipolar disorder (Shulga2011Regulation).

Animal studies have provided further insights into the role of DGKH in bipolar disorder. DGKη knockout mice, which lack the DGKH gene, display mania-like behaviors similar to those observed in bipolar disorder. These mice also show increased levels of prolactin and growth hormone, which are typically elevated in bipolar disorder patients, as well as augmented dopamine levels in the brain (Sakane2020New).

In addition to its role in psychiatric disorders, high DGKH expression has been associated with shorter survival in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, suggesting a potential involvement in AML pathogenesis (Gravina2023Role).
