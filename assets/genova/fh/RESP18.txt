# RESP18

## Overview
RESP18 is a gene that encodes the regulated endocrine-specific protein 18, a protein primarily involved in the secretory pathway of neuroendocrine tissues. This protein is categorized as a secretory protein due to its localization in the endoplasmic reticulum and association with secretory granules, which suggests a role in protein sorting and trafficking. RESP18 is highly expressed in the pituitary gland, hypothalamus, and pancreatic islets, where it is implicated in the regulation of hormone synthesis and secretion. The protein's expression is modulated by various factors, including dopaminergic agents and glucose levels, indicating its involvement in autonomic functions and potential roles in conditions such as diabetes and hypertension. RESP18 shares partial sequence homology with IA-2, a protein involved in insulin secretion, further supporting its significance in endocrine functions (Darlington1997The; Bloomquist1994RESP18; Atari2019Regulated).

## Structure
RESP18 is an 18-kDa protein initially identified in neuroendocrine tissue. The RESP18 transcript is 800 nucleotides long and codes for a 20-kDa translation product, which is reduced to an 18-kDa protein after cleavage of its NH2-terminal signal sequence. This cleavage occurs cotranslationally, and the resulting 18-kDa product is resistant to trypsin digestion, indicating its transfer into the endoplasmic reticulum (Atari2019Regulated). RESP18 contains two paired basic amino acids, initially thought to be endoproteolytic cleavage sites, but metabolic labeling in AtT-20 corticotrope tumor cells did not show smaller peptide products (Atari2019Regulated). Higher-molecular-weight isoforms of RESP18 are believed to result from O-glycosylation as the protein moves through the secretory pathway (Atari2019Regulated). In humans, alternative splicing results in three RESP18 transcripts: RESP18a, RESP18b, and a pseudogene. RESP18a and RESP18b encode proteins of 173 and 228 amino acids, respectively, with RESP18b showing 90% similarity to RESP18a (Atari2019Regulated). Both isoforms have about 40% identity to a 200-amino acid stretch in the luminal domain of islet cell antigen 512 (IA-2), also known as PTPRN (Atari2019Regulated). The genes encoding RESP18 and IA-2 are tandemly arranged on chromosome 2q35, suggesting an evolutionary relationship (Atari2019Regulated).

## Function
RESP18 (regulated endocrine-specific protein 18) is primarily involved in the secretory pathway within neuroendocrine tissues. It is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is associated with the secretory granules, indicating its role in protein sorting and trafficking (Darlington1997The; Atari2019Regulated). RESP18 is highly expressed in the pituitary gland, hypothalamus, and pancreatic islets, where it is thought to regulate hormone synthesis and secretion (Atari2019Regulated). The protein is involved in the processing of secreted peptides, as suggested by its cellular localization and regulation by dopaminergic agents (Bloomquist1994RESP18; Delhase2021Identification).

RESP18 is co-regulated with pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) in melanotropes, suggesting a role in the regulated secretory pathway (Bloomquist1994RESP18). It is also expressed in insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, where its expression is upregulated by high glucose levels, indicating a potential role in insulin regulation (Atari2019Regulated). Although the specific function of RESP18 in healthy human cells is not fully understood, its broad expression in neuroendocrine tissues and regulation by various factors suggest it plays a significant role in hormone secretion and autonomic functions (Darlington1997The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the RESP18 gene have been implicated in several physiological and pathological conditions. In the context of hypertension and renal disease, particularly salt-sensitive hypertension, RESP18 has been identified as a candidate gene for blood pressure regulation. Studies on Dahl salt-sensitive rats with a frameshift deletion in the RESP18 gene have shown increased blood pressure, renal fibrosis, and urinary protein excretion when subjected to a high-salt diet. This suggests that RESP18 plays a crucial role in regulating blood pressure and renal function, potentially through its involvement in the renal dopaminergic system (Ashraf2023Intrarenal; Ashraf2021Deep).

RESP18 is also associated with the regulation of the dopaminergic system in the kidneys. In SS-Resp18 mutant rats, there is a significant reduction in D1-like dopamine receptors, which may contribute to hypertension and renal injury. These alterations in dopamine receptor expression and function are linked to increased renal fibrosis and macrophage infiltration, indicating a role in chronic kidney disease progression (Ashraf2023Intrarenal).

In the endocrine system, RESP18 is expressed in pancreatic cells and may play a role in insulin regulation. Its expression increases in response to high glucose levels, suggesting a potential involvement in diabetes pathogenesis (Atari2019Regulated).

## Interactions
RESP18 is involved in several interactions within the endocrine system, particularly in relation to hormone secretion and regulation. It shares partial sequence homology with IA-2, a dense core vesicle protein involved in insulin secretion, suggesting a potential role in diabetes pathogenesis and glucose metabolism (Atari2019Regulated). RESP18 is co-regulated with pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) in the intermediate pituitary gland, indicating its involvement in the secretory pathway and hormone synthesis (Atari2019Regulated).

The RESP18 homology domain (RESP18HD) of ICA512, also known as IA-2, interacts with insulin and proinsulin, forming high-affinity complexes. This interaction is not mediated by disulfide bonds, as significant dissociation occurs with non-reducing buffer, indicating a specific binding mechanism (Sosa2016Biochemical). The ICA512-RESP18HD domain is crucial for the efficient targeting of ICA512 to secretory granules, highlighting its role in the insulin secretory pathway (Sosa2016Biochemical).

RESP18 is also expressed in the thyroid and pancreatic islets, where it colocalizes with insulin and other hormones, further supporting its role in endocrine functions and potential involvement in diabetes (Atari2019Regulated).
