# BIRC3

## Overview
BIRC3, also known as baculoviral IAP repeat containing 3, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family. The protein, commonly referred to as cIAP2, is characterized by the presence of baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) domains and a RING domain, which confer its ability to regulate apoptosis and cell signaling through E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. This activity is crucial for the ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation of target proteins, thereby modulating various cellular processes, including the NF-κB signaling pathways (Thorne2023Differential; DubrezDaloz2008IAPS). BIRC3 plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several cancers, where its dysregulation can lead to enhanced cell survival and resistance to apoptosis (Frazzi2021BIRC3; Diop2019Biological).

## Structure
BIRC3, also known as cIAP2, is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family characterized by several conserved domains. It contains three Baculovirus IAP Repeat (BIR) domains, each approximately 70 amino acids long, organized into α-helices and β-sheets, and stabilized by zinc ions. These BIR domains are crucial for interactions with IAP Binding Motifs (IBM) present in various proteins, including caspases and Smac/Diablo (Liang2020Comprehensive; DubrezDaloz2008IAPS).

BIRC3 also features a RING domain, which functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This domain is involved in the ubiquitylation of BIRC3 itself and other proteins, marking them for degradation or modulating their activity (DubrezDaloz2008IAPS). Additionally, BIRC3 includes a CARD (caspase activation and recruitment domain), which is involved in protein-protein interactions and may contain a nuclear export signal, suggesting a role in nuclear localization (DubrezDaloz2008IAPS).

Post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination are common in BIRC3, influencing its function and stability. While splice variant isoforms of BIRC3 may exist, specific details on these variants are not provided in the available context (DubrezDaloz2008IAPS).

## Function
BIRC3, also known as cIAP2, is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) protein family and plays a significant role in regulating apoptosis and cell signaling. It is characterized by the presence of N-terminal tandem baculovirus IAP repeats and a carboxy-terminal RING domain that provides E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. This activity facilitates the ubiquitylation of target proteins, leading to their degradation or the formation of signaling scaffolds (Thorne2023Differential).

BIRC3 is involved in both canonical and non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathways. It acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for RIPK1, promoting NF-κB signaling, which induces the expression of inflammatory cytokines and anti-apoptotic genes essential for cell survival (Thorne2023Differential). BIRC3 also maintains low levels of NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) in resting cells, preventing non-canonical NF-κB signaling (Zarnegar2008Noncanonical).

In the context of inflammation, BIRC3 is induced by cytokines such as TNF-α and IL1B, suggesting a role in later onset signaling events, possibly involving NF-κB activation via an IKK2-dependent pathway (Thorne2023Differential). BIRC3 is also a glucocorticoid-response gene, with its expression induced by glucocorticoids in epithelial cells, indicating a protective role in inflammation and cell survival (Thorne2023Differential).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the BIRC3 gene are implicated in several cancers, notably chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In CLL, BIRC3 mutations are associated with the activation of the non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation and survival. These mutations often lead to resistance to fludarabine-based chemoimmunotherapy, a common treatment for CLL, and are linked to a shorter progression-free survival (Diop2019Biological). Biallelic inactivation of BIRC3, through deletions and mutations, identifies a subgroup of CLL patients with a very aggressive form of the disease, characterized by a significantly shorter time to first treatment (Raponi2018Biallelic).

BIRC3 mutations are also significant in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), where they are associated with resistance to ibrutinib therapy due to the constitutive activation of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway (Frazzi2021BIRC3). In gliomas, increased BIRC3 expression is linked to the progression from low-grade to high-grade gliomas and is associated with poor prognosis and therapy resistance (Frazzi2021BIRC3). These findings highlight the role of BIRC3 as both a potential prognostic marker and a therapeutic target in various cancers.

## Interactions
BIRC3, also known as cIAP2, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that play significant roles in regulating apoptosis and cell survival. BIRC3 interacts with the Snail transcription factor, a relationship confirmed through yeast two-hybrid assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. This interaction is significant in cancer cell proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), influencing the expression of EMT markers and cell survival-related molecules (Rho2022Snail).

BIRC3 also interacts with MAP3K14, a central kinase in the non-canonical NF-kB pathway. This interaction is crucial for the ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of MAP3K14, and mutations in BIRC3 can stabilize MAP3K14, leading to NF-kB activation (Frazzi2021BIRC3). Additionally, BIRC3 is known to interact with other intracellular proteins such as receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1), tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors 1 and 2 (TRAF1 and TRAF2), and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 D2 (UBE2D2) (Rho2022Snail).

BIRC3's interaction with Smac/Diablo, a pro-apoptotic protein, is also notable. Smac/Diablo binds to the BIR domains of BIRC3, leading to the degradation of cIAPs and promoting apoptosis (Cossu2019Targeting). These interactions highlight BIRC3's role in modulating apoptosis and cell survival pathways.
