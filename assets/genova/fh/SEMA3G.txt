# SEMA3G

## Overview
SEMA3G is a gene that encodes the protein semaphorin 3G, a member of the semaphorin family known for its role in axonal guidance and cellular signaling. Semaphorin 3G is a secreted protein that functions primarily as a guidance cue in both the vascular and nervous systems. It is involved in the regulation of vascular stability and remodeling, particularly through its interactions with endothelial cells and its influence on β-catenin-dependent pathways (Chen2021Endotheliumderived). Additionally, semaphorin 3G plays a critical role in lymphatic vascular development by acting as a repulsive guidance cue for lymphatic endothelial cells, mediated through its binding to neuropilin-2 and PlexinD1 (Liu2016Semaphorin). Beyond its developmental roles, semaphorin 3G is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including kidney function and inflammatory responses, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular and tissue homeostasis (Ishibashi2016A).

## Function
SEMA3G (semaphorin 3G) is a protein involved in various cellular processes, primarily known for its role in vascular and neural development. In the vascular system, SEMA3G is crucial for maintaining vascular stability and remodeling. It is expressed by endothelial cells and plays a protective role in ischemic retinopathy by coordinating β-catenin-dependent pathways, which are essential for endothelial cell function and vascular integrity (Chen2021Endotheliumderived). SEMA3G enhances the interaction between β-catenin and VE-cadherin, crucial for barrier maturation and vessel stability (Chen2021Endotheliumderived).

In lymphatic vascular development, SEMA3G acts as a repulsive guidance cue for lymphatic endothelial cells, interacting with neuropilin-2 and PlexinD1 to mediate its effects. This interaction is essential for proper lymphatic vascular patterning and the spatial separation of arteries and lymphatics (Liu2016Semaphorin).

SEMA3G is also involved in kidney function, where it is expressed in glomerular podocytes. It plays a protective role against inflammatory kidney diseases by attenuating the expression of inflammatory cytokines and inhibiting Toll-like receptor 4 signaling (Ishibashi2016A). These diverse roles highlight SEMA3G's importance in maintaining cellular and tissue homeostasis across different organ systems.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SEMA3G gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and vascular disorders. In kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), SEMA3G is downregulated, and its reduced expression is associated with poor prognosis. Conversely, higher SEMA3G expression correlates with better overall and disease-free survival, as well as increased tumor immune infiltration, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor and favorable prognostic biomarker in KIRC (Yuan2023SEMA3G).

In the context of ischemic retinopathy, SEMA3G plays a crucial role in vascular remodeling and stability. Its deficiency leads to increased vascular leakage and pathological angiogenesis, as observed in conditions like proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR). SEMA3G is upregulated under hypoxic conditions, mediated by HIF-2α, and is essential for maintaining vascular integrity through β-catenin stabilization (Chen2021Endotheliumderived).

In glial tumors, SEMA3G expression is associated with prolonged survival, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker. Its expression, along with other class-3 semaphorins, may act as inhibitors of tumor progression (KarayanTapon2008Semaphorin).

## Interactions
Semaphorin 3G (SEMA3G) interacts with several proteins, primarily through its role in cell signaling and guidance. SEMA3G binds to a receptor complex composed of Neuropilin-2 (Nrp2) and PlexinD1. This interaction is crucial for its function as a repulsive guidance cue for lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), influencing their alignment and branching during lymphatic vascular development. SEMA3G binds strongly to Nrp2, which acts as a co-receptor with PlexinD1, facilitating the repulsive effect on LECs (Liu2016Semaphorin).

In the context of joint inflammation, SEMA3G interacts with Nrp2 expressed by activated macrophages in the synovium. This interaction promotes macrophage migration and proliferation, contributing to the exacerbation of arthritis (Shoda2022Semaphorin).

A mutation in SEMA3G, specifically the p.G166V mutation, alters its binding affinity and selectivity to its co-receptors, PLXNA4 and PLXNA1. This mutation increases the binding affinity of SEMA3G for PLXNA1, potentially disrupting other semaphorin signals crucial for GnRH neuron development (Oleari2020A). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of SEMA3G in various physiological processes.
