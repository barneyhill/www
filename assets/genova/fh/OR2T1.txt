# OR2T1

## Overview
The OR2T1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily T member 1, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein is primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a critical role in the olfactory system by initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. OR2T1 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, triggering neuronal responses. Interestingly, OR2T1 is also expressed in non-olfactory tissues such as the kidney, lung, and heart, suggesting potential roles beyond olfaction, although these functions are not yet fully understood. The gene has been implicated in various clinical contexts, including schizophrenia and prostate cancer, highlighting its potential significance in human health and disease (Ansoleaga2015Decrease; Zhang2007Characterizing; Cole2022Distal).

## Structure


## Function
OR2T1 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein involved in the detection of odor molecules. This protein is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. OR2T1 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, triggering neuronal responses that contribute to the sense of smell (Zhang2007Characterizing).

Beyond its role in olfaction, OR2T1 is also expressed in non-olfactory tissues, such as the kidney, lung, and heart, suggesting potential additional functions beyond odorant recognition (Zhang2007Characterizing). The expression of OR2T1 in these tissues raises questions about its involvement in other physiological processes, although specific functions in these contexts are not fully understood. The presence of OR2T1 in non-olfactory tissues may be related to evolutionary constraints and functional optimization across multiple tissues (Zhang2007Characterizing).

In the context of schizophrenia, OR2T1 expression is significantly down-regulated in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, indicating a potential link to the pathophysiology of the disorder (Ansoleaga2015Decrease). However, the specific molecular function of OR2T1 in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the OR2T1 gene have been associated with schizophrenia. Studies have shown a significant down-regulation of OR2T1 mRNA levels in individuals with chronic schizophrenia compared to controls, with this decrease being linked to the daily antipsychotic dose and the age of onset of the illness (Ansoleaga2015Decrease). This suggests that the down-regulation of OR2T1 may be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and could be influenced by antipsychotic treatment (Ansoleaga2015Decrease).

The OR2T1 gene is also implicated in cancer, specifically prostate cancer. In prostate tumors, OR2T1 has been identified with large mediated effects, although its expression is generally low in these tumors. This suggests a potential role in prostate cancer progression (Cole2022Distal).

Despite these associations, the clinical significance of OR2T1 gene mutations remains unclear, as the studies do not provide detailed information on the direct impact of specific mutations in relation to these diseases (Saeed2023Smell). The complexity of these conditions, particularly schizophrenia, indicates a multifactorial nature with no single variant shared among affected individuals (Saeed2023Smell).
