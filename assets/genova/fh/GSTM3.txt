# GSTM3

## Overview
GSTM3 is a gene that encodes the enzyme glutathione S-transferase mu 3, a member of the mu class of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs). This enzyme plays a pivotal role in cellular detoxification processes by catalyzing the conjugation of glutathione to a variety of electrophilic compounds, thereby aiding in the neutralization of toxins and carcinogens. GSTM3 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is involved in cellular defense against oxidative stress, contributing to cellular homeostasis and protection against damage. In the human brain, GSTM3 also functions as a cytosolic prostaglandin E synthase, which is crucial for physiological processes such as temperature regulation and nociception. The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, testis, lung, and lymphocytes, and its expression can be influenced by genetic polymorphisms, potentially affecting an individual's susceptibility to diseases and response to drugs (Beuckmann2000IdentificationofmuclassglutathionetransferasesM22andM33ascytosolicprostaglandinEsynthasesinthehumanbrain; Liu2005ExpressionBased; Tetlow2004Polymorphism).

## Structure
The GSTM3 protein is a member of the mu class glutathione S-transferases, characterized by its distinct molecular structure. The primary structure of GSTM3 consists of a unique sequence of amino acids, with approximately 70% identity to other mu class GSTs, and features unique N-terminal and C-terminal extensions (Patskovsky1999An). The secondary structure includes conserved elements such as alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its overall fold.

The tertiary structure of GSTM3 is crucial for its function, with a three-dimensional conformation that includes a glutathione-binding G-site. This site is structurally similar to other isoforms, with conserved side chain positions involved in GSH binding, including residues like Tyr10, Trp11, and Arg46 (Patskovsky1999An). The catalytic site involves additional residues such as Ile115 and Tyr119, with hydrophobic interactions maintaining the enzyme's structure (Patskovsky1999An).

GSTM3 can form homodimers or heterodimers, representing its quaternary structure. The enzyme's C-terminal domain is more flexible compared to other GSTs, influencing its catalytic properties (Patskovsky1999An). The presence of an Asn212 residue, instead of a hydrophobic phenylalanine, significantly affects the enzyme's catalytic efficiency and flexibility (Patskovsky1999An). The protein also exhibits polymorphisms, such as the pG147W and pV224I substitutions, which can influence its enzymatic activity (Tetlow2004Polymorphism).

## Function
GSTM3 (glutathione S-transferase mu 3) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in detoxification processes within human cells. It belongs to the glutathione S-transferase (GST) family, which catalyzes the conjugation of glutathione to various electrophilic compounds, aiding in the neutralization of toxins and carcinogens (Tetlow2004Polymorphism). GSTM3 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is involved in cellular defense against oxidative stress, contributing to cellular homeostasis and protection against damage (ROWE1997Subunit).

In the human brain, GSTM3 functions as a cytosolic prostaglandin E synthase, catalyzing the conversion of prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). This process is essential for various physiological functions, including temperature regulation, nociception, and sleep-wake regulation (Beuckmann2000IdentificationofmuclassglutathionetransferasesM22andM33ascytosolicprostaglandinEsynthasesinthehumanbrain). The enzyme's activity is dependent on thiol compounds like glutathione, with its activity increasing linearly with PGH2 concentration (Beuckmann2000IdentificationofmuclassglutathionetransferasesM22andM33ascytosolicprostaglandinEsynthasesinthehumanbrain).

GSTM3 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, testis, lung, and lymphocytes, and is involved in protecting cells against toxic insults (Liu2005ExpressionBased). Its expression is influenced by genetic polymorphisms, which can affect its activity and expression levels, potentially altering an individual's susceptibility to diseases and their response to drugs (Tetlow2004Polymorphism).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the GSTM3 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In ovarian cancer, GSTM3 expression is decreased compared to normal ovarian tissues, yet paradoxically, its expression is associated with poor prognosis. This may be due to GSTM3's role in detoxifying electrophilic compounds, contributing to drug resistance and poor outcomes in cancer patients (Zhang2022Comprehensive). GSTM3 is also involved in immune cell infiltration regulation and can predict prognosis in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (Zhang2022Comprehensive).

In Brugada Syndrome, a deletion in the GSTM3 gene, specifically affecting exon 8 and the transcription stop codon, is significantly associated with the condition, particularly in patients without SCN5A mutations. This deletion is linked to a higher incidence of sudden cardiac arrest and syncope, suggesting that GSTM3 acts as a genetic modifier in the syndrome (Juang2020GSTM3).

GSTM3 polymorphisms have also been associated with Alzheimer's disease through an epistatic interaction with the HHEX/IDE/KIF11 locus, contributing to the disease's risk, particularly in individuals over 75 years old (Bullock2013Discovery). Additionally, specific GSTM3 genotypes may influence susceptibility and severity of COVID-19, with certain genotypes associated with higher odds of developing the disease (Coric2021GSTP1).

## Interactions
GSTM3 (glutathione S-transferase mu 3) is known to participate in various physical interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular defense mechanisms. This enzyme is involved in detoxification processes by catalyzing the conjugation of glutathione to a range of substrates. GSTM3 can form complexes with other glutathione S-transferase (GST) isoenzymes, which may enhance its functional capacity in detoxification pathways. These interactions are crucial for the enzyme's role in managing oxidative stress within cells.

In addition to forming complexes with other GST isoenzymes, GSTM3 interacts with signaling molecules, which can influence cellular responses to oxidative stress. These interactions may be transient, serving to either activate or inhibit specific signaling pathways, thereby modulating the cell's response to environmental stressors. The ability of GSTM3 to interact with both proteins and nucleic acids highlights its versatile role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and protecting against damage from reactive oxygen species. These interactions underscore the importance of GSTM3 in cellular defense and its potential impact on various physiological and pathological processes.
