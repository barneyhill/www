# AZIN2

## Overview
AZIN2, or antizyme inhibitor 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of polyamine metabolism, a critical process for cell growth and function. The AZIN2 protein is categorized as an antizyme inhibitor, sharing structural similarities with ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and antizyme inhibitor 1 (AZIN1), but it primarily exists as a monomer within cells (RamosMolina2014Structural). Functionally, AZIN2 plays a pivotal role in inhibiting antizymes, thereby promoting polyamine uptake and biosynthesis by counteracting the inhibitory effects of antizymes on ODC activity (LópezContreras2008Antizyme). The protein is predominantly expressed in the brain and testes, where it is involved in processes such as spermiogenesis and intracellular vesicle trafficking (LópezContreras2008Antizyme; Kanerva2010Ornithine). Clinically, alterations in AZIN2 expression have been linked to various diseases, including non-small cell lung cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and cardiovascular conditions, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Shi2021Hypoxiainduced; SanduskyBeltran2021Aberrant; Li2019Inhibition).

## Structure
The AZIN2 protein, encoded by the AZIN2 gene, is involved in the regulation of polyamine metabolism. Structurally, AZIN2 shares similarities with ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and antizyme inhibitor 1 (AZIN1), particularly in its tertiary structure, which includes a TIM-like alpha/beta-barrel and beta-sheet domains. However, AZIN2 does not form homodimers like ODC, primarily existing as a monomer in cells (RamosMolina2014Structural).

The AZIN2 protein consists of 460 amino acids and shows 45% identity and 67% similarity with AZIN1 in humans (Rajput2015RefSeq). Its N-terminal region is crucial for its localization to the Golgi membranes and the ER-Golgi Intermediate Compartment (ERGIC), indicating a role in subcellular localization (López‐Contreras2009Subcellular).

AZIN2's interaction with antizyme 1 (AZ1) is mediated by the antizyme-binding element (AZBE), where specific conserved residues are essential for binding. This interaction influences AZIN2's stability and degradation, as well as its role in polyamine uptake and ODC activity (RamosMolina2014Structural). The protein's degradation is affected by proteasome inhibitors, suggesting alternative degradation pathways (RamosMolina2014Structural). Information on post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms of AZIN2 is limited in the available literature.

## Function
AZIN2, also known as antizyme inhibitor 2, is a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating polyamine metabolism in mammalian cells. Polyamines, such as putrescine, spermidine, and spermine, are vital for normal cell physiology and growth. AZIN2 functions by inhibiting antizymes, which are proteins that negatively regulate polyamine transport and biosynthesis. This inhibition leads to increased polyamine uptake and biosynthesis by counteracting the antizymes' effects on ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity, a key enzyme in polyamine synthesis (LópezContreras2008Antizyme).

AZIN2 is predominantly expressed in the brain and testes, indicating its tissue-specific roles. In the testes, it is particularly involved in maintaining appropriate polyamine levels during spermiogenesis (LópezContreras2008Antizyme). The protein is also associated with intracellular vesicle trafficking, particularly in the trans-Golgi network (TGN), where it regulates the morphology and function of the TGN and facilitates efficient protein transport (Kanerva2010Ornithine). AZIN2's role in vesicle trafficking is mediated through its regulation of ODC activity, which is crucial for maintaining cellular polyamine homeostasis and efficient vesicle trafficking (Kanerva2010Ornithine).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the AZIN2 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), increased levels of AZIN2 are associated with resistance to cisplatin (DDP) treatment. DDP-resistant NSCLC cells and patients exhibit significantly higher AZIN2 mRNA and protein levels compared to their sensitive counterparts. This overexpression is linked to poorer overall survival rates, suggesting that AZIN2 may contribute to DDP resistance through the epithelial-mesenchymal transition pathway (Shi2021Hypoxiainduced).

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), AZIN2 expression is altered, with increased protein levels associated with phospho-tau, a marker of tau pathology. Overexpression of AZIN2 in tauopathy models leads to a maladaptive polyamine stress response, increased tau deposition, and cognitive impairments. This suggests that AZIN2 plays a role in the progression of tauopathies by affecting polyamine metabolism and tau pathology, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for tau-related diseases (SanduskyBeltran2021Aberrant).

In cardiovascular diseases, particularly myocardial infarction (MI), the AZIN2 splice variant (AZIN2-sv) negatively regulates endothelial cell migration and neovascularization. Knockdown of AZIN2-sv enhances cardiac repair by promoting angiogenesis and cardiomyocyte regeneration, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target for improving MI prognosis (Li2018Loss; Li2019Inhibition).

## Interactions
AZIN2 interacts with antizymes, particularly AZ1, AZ2, and AZ3, to regulate polyamine metabolism. The binding of AZIN2 to antizymes prevents them from inhibiting ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), thereby promoting polyamine synthesis. This interaction is crucial for AZIN2's function, as demonstrated by the loss of stimulatory effect on polyamine uptake when the antizyme binding domain (AZBE) is deleted (LópezContreras2009Expression; LópezContreras2008Antizyme).

AZIN2 is mainly present as a monomer and is associated with the membranes of the Golgi network. Co-transfection with antizymes can stabilize AZIN2, with AZ1 and AZ2 having a more significant protective effect than AZ3. The binding of AZ1 to AZIN2 prevents the interaction of AZIN2 with other target proteins, suggesting a competitive binding mechanism (RamosMolina2014Structural).

AZIN2 also interacts with AZ3, forming heterodimers that stabilize both proteins and decrease their degradation by the proteasome. This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, where the presence of AZ3 increases the levels of AZIN2 and vice versa (LópezContreras2009Expression). These interactions highlight AZIN2's role in regulating polyamine metabolism and its potential physiological roles.
