# AIRE

## Overview
The AIRE (autoimmune regulator) gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in the establishment of immune tolerance by regulating the expression of tissue-specific antigens in the thymus. The protein encoded by AIRE is primarily expressed in medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) and is essential for the negative selection of autoreactive T cells, thereby preventing autoimmune diseases (Fierabracci2011Recent; Peterson2008Transcriptional). Structurally, AIRE is characterized by several domains, including a caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD), a SAND domain, and plant homeodomain (PHD) fingers, which facilitate its interactions with chromatin and other proteins to modulate gene expression (Kumar2001The; Saltis2008Evolutionarily). Mutations in the AIRE gene are linked to Autoimmune Polyendocrine Syndrome Type 1 (APS-1), underscoring its critical function in immune regulation (Abramson2016Autoimmune).

## Structure
The AIRE protein is a transcription factor with a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. Its primary structure consists of 545 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 56-58 kDa (Kumar2001The; Björses2000Mutations). The protein features a caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) at the N-terminus, which is involved in oligomerization (Shevyrev2022Phylogeny). It also contains a SAND domain, which is crucial for DNA binding, characterized by a novel α/β-fold with a conserved KDWK sequence motif (Kumar2001The; Saltis2008Evolutionarily).

The secondary structure of AIRE includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its functional conformation (Saltis2008Evolutionarily). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains into a functional protein capable of interacting with DNA and other proteins (Kumar2001The). AIRE can form homodimers and homotetramers, which are essential for its DNA binding activity, indicating a quaternary structure that facilitates its role as a transcription regulator (Kumar2001The).

Post-translational modifications of AIRE include phosphorylation, which is suggested to trigger its dimerization and is involved in cAMP-dependent signal transduction (Kumar2001The). The protein also has splice variant isoforms, which may result in different functional roles (Saltis2008Evolutionarily).

## Function
The AIRE (autoimmune regulator) gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in maintaining immune tolerance by regulating gene expression in the thymus. AIRE is primarily active in medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs), where it promotes the expression of tissue-specific antigens (TSAs). This expression is crucial for the negative selection of autoreactive T cells, preventing them from attacking the body's own tissues and thus averting autoimmune diseases (Fierabracci2011Recent; Peterson2008Transcriptional).

AIRE functions as a transcriptional regulator, influencing a wide array of genes. It does not bind directly to DNA but interacts with chromatin and various proteins to facilitate transcription. AIRE contains several domains, including PHD fingers and a SAND domain, which are involved in chromatin binding and transcriptional activation (Peterson2008Transcriptional; Perniola2018Twenty). The protein recruits transcriptional complexes, such as the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), to RNA polymerase II, promoting transcriptional elongation (Peterson2008Transcriptional).

AIRE's activity is also linked to chromatin remodeling and histone modification, which are essential for its role in gene regulation. It interacts with proteins like CREB-binding protein (CBP) and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), which are involved in transcriptional activation and DNA repair (Peterson2008Transcriptional; Mathis2009Aire). Through these interactions, AIRE ensures the expression of a diverse set of genes necessary for immune tolerance (Fierabracci2011Recent).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AIRE gene are primarily associated with Autoimmune Polyendocrine Syndrome Type 1 (APS-1), also known as Autoimmune Polyendocrinopathy-Candidiasis-Ectodermal Dystrophy (APECED). APS-1 is characterized by chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, hypoparathyroidism, and primary adrenal insufficiency. Patients may also experience additional autoimmune manifestations such as enamel hypoplasia, type-1 diabetes, vitiligo, alopecia, and autoimmune hepatitis (Abramson2016Autoimmune; Rizzi2006Disruption). The condition follows an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, with over 100 mutations identified in the AIRE locus, including common mutations like R257X and Y85C (Abramson2016Autoimmune).

AIRE mutations can also lead to milder autoimmune diseases, such as pernicious anemia and vitiligo, due to dominant negative effects of certain mutations in the SAND and PHD1 domains (Bruserud2016AIREmutations). Alterations in AIRE expression or its interactions can contribute to other autoimmune disorders by affecting the elimination of self-reactive T cells (Improda2021Genetics). Dysregulated AIRE expression has been linked to autoimmune conditions in complex syndromes like Down Syndrome and may influence cancerogenesis, particularly in melanoma development (Improda2021Genetics).

## Interactions
The AIRE (autoimmune regulator) protein is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in transcriptional regulation and immune tolerance. AIRE interacts with the CREB-binding protein (CBP), a transcriptional coactivator, through the CH1 and CH3 domains of CBP. This interaction is significant for AIRE's transcriptional activities and may position AIRE as a novel CBP cofactor, potentially bridging the basal transcriptional machinery and signal-activated trans-regulators (Pitkänen2000The).

AIRE also interacts with the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) complex, which includes Ku70, Ku80, and DNA-PKcs. This interaction is important for AIRE's transcriptional regulation, as DNA-PK phosphorylates AIRE, enhancing its activity. The interaction with DNA-PK can occur independently of DNA and RNA, although chromatin may enhance it (Liiv2008DNAPK; Peterson2008Transcriptional).

AIRE forms homodimers and homotetramers, which are important for its DNA-binding capabilities. These oligomeric forms of AIRE have a higher binding affinity to DNA, facilitating its role in transcriptional regulation (Kumar2001The).
