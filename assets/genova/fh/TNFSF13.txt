# TNFSF13

## Overview
TNFSF13 is a gene that encodes the protein known as APRIL (A Proliferation-Inducing Ligand), which is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily. APRIL is categorized as a type II transmembrane protein, and it can be cleaved to form a soluble ligand. This protein plays a crucial role in the immune system, particularly in the regulation of B cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. APRIL interacts with specific receptors such as TACI (Transmembrane Activator and CAML Interactor) and BCMA (B-cell maturation antigen), which are essential for maintaining B cell homeostasis and antibody production. The gene and its encoded protein are implicated in various immune-related diseases, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia and systemic lupus erythematosus, highlighting their clinical significance (Bossen2006BAFF; He2007Intestinal; Jasek2020Association).

## Structure
The TNFSF13 gene encodes the APRIL protein, a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily. APRIL is a type II transmembrane protein that can be cleaved to form a soluble ligand. The primary structure of APRIL includes a cytoplasmic domain, a transmembrane region, and an extracellular domain. The extracellular domain contains a TNF homology domain, which is crucial for receptor binding (Luo2011Molecular). 

APRIL typically forms homotrimers, a common structural feature in the TNF superfamily, which facilitates its interaction with receptors such as TACI, BCMA, and BAFF-R (Bossen2006BAFF). The protein contains conserved cysteine residues and a potential N-linked glycosylation site, which may influence its stability and function (Luo2011Molecular). 

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are known to occur, affecting the protein's stability and function. Alternative splicing of the APRIL gene can result in different isoforms, such as APRIL-␤ and APRIL-␥, which may alter its biological activity (Bossen2006BAFF). These structural features and modifications are essential for APRIL's role in immune cell survival and proliferation.

## Function
TNFSF13, also known as APRIL, is a cytokine that plays a significant role in the immune system by promoting B cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. It is involved in immunoglobulin class switching, particularly influencing the production of immunoglobulin A2 (IgA2) in the intestinal mucosa. This process is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis and protecting against bacterial infections in the gut (He2007Intestinal).

APRIL is abundantly expressed by intestinal epithelial cells and is upregulated in response to bacterial exposure, mediated through Toll-like receptor signaling pathways. This cytokine collaborates with bacterial products to facilitate IgA2 class switch recombination in B cells, independent of T cell and CD40 signaling (He2007Intestinal).

In addition to its role in the gut, TNFSF13 is associated with serum immunoglobulin levels, including IgM, IgG, and IgA, through its interactions with receptors such as TACI and BCMA. These interactions are essential for B cell homeostasis and antibody production (Osman2012Association). TNFSF13 also influences epithelial cell proliferation and apoptosis, potentially through interactions with the FAS receptor, which modulates apoptosis signaling (Ma2024TNFSF13).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TNFSF13 gene, which encodes the APRIL protein, have been implicated in various diseases, particularly those involving the immune system. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the rs3803800AA genotype of TNFSF13 is associated with a twofold increased risk of disease development compared to carriers of the G allele. This genotype is linked to higher APRIL expression, which may contribute to CLL pathogenesis by promoting B cell survival (Jasek2020Association). The rs3803800A allele is also associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and has been linked to increased susceptibility to related hematological malignancies, such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma (Jasek2020Association).

In systemic lupus erythematosus, elevated levels of soluble APRIL have been observed, and genetic variants in TNFSF13, such as the p.Gly67Arg variant, have been associated with the disease, although significance varies across populations (OrtizAljaro2022Protein). These genetic variants may affect APRIL's interactions with its receptors, impacting immune regulation and contributing to disease susceptibility (OrtizAljaro2022Protein).

The TNFSF13 gene is also involved in immunoglobulin regulation, with certain SNPs affecting serum levels of non-albumin proteins and immunoglobulin isotypes, which are relevant in conditions like IgA nephropathy (Osman2012Association). These findings underscore the clinical significance of TNFSF13 in immune-related diseases.

## Interactions
TNFSF13, also known as APRIL, is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily and interacts with several receptors, primarily BCMA (B-cell maturation antigen) and TACI (Transmembrane Activator and CAML Interactor). These interactions are crucial for the regulation of B-cell proliferation and survival. APRIL binds specifically to BCMA and TACI, but not to other TNF family ligands such as CD40L, TWEAK, or TRAIL (Yu2000APRIL). The binding of APRIL to these receptors has been shown to stimulate B cell proliferation, which can be inhibited by BCMA-Fc and TACI-Fc acting as decoy receptors (Yu2000APRIL).

In the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), TNFSF13 interacts with TNFRSF17, a receptor expressed on leukemia cells, to promote cell proliferation and survival in an NF-κB-dependent manner (Chapellier2019Arrayed). This interaction suppresses apoptosis and supports the growth of leukemia cells (Chapellier2019Arrayed). TNFSF13 is secreted by normal myeloid cells, suggesting a supportive role for leukemia cells by mature myeloid bone marrow cells (Chapellier2019Arrayed). These interactions highlight the potential of TNFSF13 as a target for therapeutic intervention in AML.
