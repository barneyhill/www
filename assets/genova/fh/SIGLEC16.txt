# SIGLEC16

## Overview
SIGLEC16 is a gene that encodes the protein sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin 16, which is a member of the CD33-related Siglec subfamily. This protein functions as an activating receptor primarily expressed in macrophages and is involved in immune regulation. Unlike other Siglecs that typically have inhibitory roles, SIGLEC16 associates with the DAP12 adaptor protein, which contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), facilitating its role in activating immune responses (Cao2008SIGLEC16). The protein is characterized by its ability to bind sialic acids, which are common components of cell surface glycans, allowing it to participate in recognizing self-associated molecular patterns and modulating immune responses (Läubli2019Sialic). SIGLEC16's interaction with pathogens, such as Escherichia coli, underscores its role in host defense mechanisms (Schwarz2017Paired). The gene exhibits genetic variability, with both functional and non-functional alleles present in the human population, which may influence its immune regulatory functions and clinical significance (Hayakawa2017Coevolution).

## Structure
The SIGLEC16 gene encodes a protein that is part of the sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs) family. The protein structure includes four immunoglobulin superfamily domains, a transmembrane domain with a charged lysine residue, and a short cytoplasmic tail lacking an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) (Cao2008SIGLEC16). This structure allows SIGLEC16 to associate with the DAP12 adaptor protein, which contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), facilitating its role as an activating receptor (Cao2008SIGLEC16).

The SIGLEC16 protein shares 99% amino acid identity with Siglec-11 in its predicted sialic acid recognition domains, suggesting similar sialic acid binding specificity (Cao2008SIGLEC16). The gene has both functional and non-functional alleles, with the non-functional allele, SIGLEC16P, resulting from a four-base pair deletion in exon 2 that disrupts the open reading frame (Hayakawa2017Coevolution). This deletion leads to a truncated protein lacking a transmembrane domain (Hayakawa2017Coevolution). The presence of splice variant isoforms may affect the protein's function and localization, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context.

## Function
SIGLEC16 encodes a receptor that is part of the CD33-related Siglec subfamily, which is involved in immune regulation. This receptor is primarily expressed in macrophages and is associated with the DAP12 adaptor protein, which plays a role in activating immune responses (Cao2008SIGLEC16). SIGLEC16 has evolved from its inhibitory counterpart, SIGLEC11, and functions as an activating receptor due to a positively charged lysine in its transmembrane domain that allows it to associate with DAP12 (Cao2008SIGLEC16; Schwarz2014Human-Specific).

In healthy human cells, SIGLEC16 is involved in modulating immune responses, particularly in the context of pathogen recognition. It is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, where it may play a role in microglial cell function (Cao2008SIGLEC16). The receptor's ability to bind sialic acids suggests it participates in recognizing self-associated molecular patterns, which helps regulate immune responses and maintain immune tolerance (Läubli2019Sialic). SIGLEC16's interaction with pathogens, such as E. coli, indicates its role in enhancing immune defense mechanisms (Schwarz2017Paired). The presence of both functional and non-functional alleles in the human population suggests variability in its immune regulatory functions (Cao2008SIGLEC16).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SIGLEC16 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of cancer, SIGLEC16 is differentially expressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues across multiple cancer types. It is associated with immune regulation within the tumor microenvironment, potentially influencing tumorigenesis and progression. In pancreatic adenocarcinoma, SIGLEC16 expression correlates with patients' overall survival, suggesting its role in cancer prognosis (Chen2020Tumor). In lung adenocarcinoma, decreased SIGLEC16 expression is linked to worse overall survival, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Zhang2021Integrative).

The presence of both functional and non-functional alleles of SIGLEC16 in humans suggests genetic variability that may affect immune responses. The nonfunctional SIGLEC16P allele is prevalent, indicating a complex evolutionary history where SIGLEC16 may be beneficial in some contexts but deleterious in others, such as in reducing unnecessary brain microglia activation, which could be linked to mental disorders like schizophrenia (Hayakawa2017Coevolution). The gene's interaction with pathogens, such as Escherichia coli K1, highlights its role in host defense, although this interaction may also contribute to inflammatory responses (Hayakawa2017Coevolution).

## Interactions
SIGLEC16 is known to interact specifically with the DAP12 adaptor protein, which contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM). This interaction is crucial for the activation signals mediated by SIGLEC16, distinguishing it from other Siglecs that typically have inhibitory functions due to the presence of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs (ITIMs) (Cao2008SIGLEC16). The association between SIGLEC16 and DAP12 has been demonstrated through experiments using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy, which showed that SIGLEC16 is expressed on the cell surface in the presence of DAP12 (Cao2008SIGLEC16).

SIGLEC16 also interacts with the polysialic acid capsule of pathogenic Escherichia coli K1. This interaction is significant in the immune response, as SIGLEC16 enhances bacterial killing, suggesting a role in host defense against this pathogen (Schwarz2017Paired). The presence of SIGLEC16 in macrophages and its interaction with DAP12 and E. coli K1 highlight its role in modulating immune responses and potentially counteracting pathogen exploitation of inhibitory Siglecs (Cao2008SIGLEC16; Schwarz2017Paired).
