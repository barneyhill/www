# CBX8

## Overview
CBX8, or chromobox 8, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is a critical component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1). The chromobox 8 protein is primarily involved in chromatin remodeling and gene silencing, functioning as a chromatin-associated protein that plays a significant role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. It achieves this by binding to specific histone marks, such as H3K27me3, and DNA, thereby facilitating transcriptional repression (Connelly2018Engagement). Chromobox 8 is particularly important in stem cell biology, where it aids in the transition from a repressed chromatin state to an active state during differentiation, underscoring its role in cellular differentiation and lineage commitment (van2021Biological). Additionally, CBX8 has been implicated in various cancers, where its dysregulation is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Zhang2018CBX8; Yuan2017Chromobox).

## Function
CBX8 (chromobox 8) is a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), which plays a crucial role in chromatin remodeling and gene silencing. In healthy human cells, CBX8 is involved in maintaining transcriptional repression of target genes through its interactions with chromatin. The protein associates with chromatin via its chromodomain, which binds to the histone mark H3K27me3 and DNA, facilitating transcriptional repression (Connelly2018Engagement).

CBX8 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. It is enriched at specific genomic loci and is necessary for the repression of certain genes, highlighting its role in transcriptional regulation (Connelly2018Engagement). The protein's ability to bind both DNA and H3K27me3 is crucial for its function in chromatin association and gene regulation (Connelly2018Engagement).

CBX8 also plays a role in stem cell biology, where it facilitates the transition from a polycomb-repressed chromatin state to an active state during differentiation. This function is essential for the activation of embryonic stem cell differentiation genes, indicating CBX8's involvement in promoting differentiation and lineage commitment (van2021Biological).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CBX8 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CBX8 is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis, promoting tumor growth and metastasis through the activation of the AKT/β-catenin signaling pathway. This oncogenic activity is facilitated by the upregulation of EGR1 and miR-365a-3p, which enhance the nuclear localization of β-catenin (Zhang2018CBX8). CBX8 also interacts with Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1) to regulate cell cycle progression in HCC, further contributing to its role in cancer progression (Xiao2019Chromobox).

In muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), CBX8 is frequently upregulated and linked to cancer progression and poor survival outcomes. It promotes cell proliferation by repressing the p53 pathway, and its overexpression is correlated with gene amplification in MIBC tissues (Yuan2017Chromobox).

CBX8 is also involved in MLL-AF9-induced leukemogenesis, where it acts as a crucial cofactor for leukemic transformation, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in MLL-rearranged leukemias (Tan2011CBX8). These findings highlight CBX8's significant role in tumorigenesis and its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in various cancers.

## Interactions
CBX8 is a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) and interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids. It binds with BMI1, another PRC1 component, and this interaction is crucial for their mutual binding to the INK4A-ARF locus in both human and mouse cells. This binding is dependent on the presence of both proteins, indicating a cooperative interaction within the PRC1 complex (Dietrich2007Bypass).

CBX8 also interacts with other PRC1 components such as RING1B, HPH1, and HPH2, and is involved in the formation of PcG bodies, which are disrupted when CBX8 is downregulated (Dietrich2007Bypass). In hepatocellular carcinoma cells, CBX8 interacts with Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1) to promote cell proliferation, a process dependent on YBX1, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Xiao2019Chromobox).

CBX8's chromodomain is essential for its chromatin association, engaging with both DNA and the histone mark H3K27me3. This interaction is crucial for its role in transcriptional repression, with DNA binding enhancing its affinity for H3K27me3 (Connelly2018Engagement). CBX8 can form a ternary complex with DNA and H3K27me3, which stabilizes its chromatin association (Connelly2018Engagement).
