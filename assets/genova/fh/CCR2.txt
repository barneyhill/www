# CCR2

## Overview
CCR2, or C-C motif chemokine receptor 2, is a gene that encodes a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in the immune system's response to inflammation. The receptor, also known as C-C motif chemokine receptor 2, is characterized by its seven transmembrane α-helices, typical of the rhodopsin-like GPCR family, and is primarily expressed on the surface of immune cells such as monocytes, T lymphocytes, and NK cells. CCR2 plays a critical role in mediating the migration and infiltration of monocytes and macrophages to sites of inflammation by binding to its primary ligand, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1 or CCL2) (Fantuzzi1999Loss; Kuziel1997Severe). This receptor is integral to the chemotactic response, facilitating immune cell movement towards inflammatory sites, and is implicated in various pathological conditions, including multiple sclerosis, HIV progression, and cancer (Petersen2002Novel; Bose2013Role; Fantuzzi2019Dual). The CCR2 gene's expression and function are tightly regulated, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in diseases characterized by chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation (Fantuzzi1999Loss; Boring1997Impaired).

## Structure
CCR2, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), is characterized by its seven transmembrane α-helices, which are typical of the rhodopsin or serpentine receptor family. These helices are connected by three extracellular and three intracellular loops, with the NH2-terminus located extracellularly and the COOH-terminus intracellularly (Van1999The; Stone2017Mechanisms). The receptor's structure includes a short extracellular NH2-terminus and a carboxy-terminal intracellular region, which contains numerous serine and threonine residues that can be phosphorylated following receptor activation, leading to desensitization (Van1999The).

CCR2 exists in two splice variant isoforms, CCR2A and CCR2B, which differ in their carboxy-terminal regions. CCR2B is the predominant form in monocytes and is more efficiently trafficked to the cell surface than CCR2A (Van1999The; Stone2017Mechanisms). The receptor is involved in binding several monocyte chemoattractant proteins (MCPs), including MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, and MCP-4 (Van1999The).

The receptor's structure is stabilized by conserved disulfide bonds, which connect the N-terminus to the third extracellular loop (ECL3) and the first extracellular loop (ECL1) to the second (ECL2) (Stone2017Mechanisms). These structural features contribute to the receptor's ability to generate balanced or biased signaling activities (vacchini2016analysis).

## Function
CCR2 (C-C motif chemokine receptor 2) is a chemokine receptor that plays a pivotal role in the immune system by mediating the migration and infiltration of monocytes and macrophages to sites of inflammation. It primarily binds to monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), also known as CCL2, which is a potent chemoattractant for monocytes. This interaction is crucial for the chemotactic response, facilitating the movement of immune cells towards inflammatory sites (Fantuzzi1999Loss; Kuziel1997Severe).

CCR2 is expressed on the surface of various immune cells, including monocytes, T lymphocytes, NK cells, and basophils, and is involved in the regulation of leukocyte adhesion and extravasation. In healthy human cells, CCR2 activation by its ligands leads to the recruitment of monocytes and macrophages, which are essential for host defense and tissue repair (Fantuzzi1999Loss; Kuziel1997Severe). The receptor is also implicated in the modulation of cytokine production, such as IFN-γ, which is important for immune responses (Boring1997Impaired).

CCR2's function is not redundant with other chemokine receptors, highlighting its unique role in immune cell trafficking and response to inflammatory stimuli (Boring1997Impaired). Its expression is highly regulated and can be modulated by various cytokines and microbial agents, reflecting its dynamic role in immune regulation (Fantuzzi1999Loss).

## Clinical Significance
The CCR2 gene is clinically significant due to its involvement in various diseases through mutations, altered expression levels, or disrupted interactions. In multiple sclerosis (MS), CCR2 is crucial for recruiting monocytes to the central nervous system (CNS), contributing to inflammatory lesions. Experimental models show that the absence of CCR2 prevents encephalopathy and inflammatory infiltrates, indicating its role in MS progression (Bose2013Role; Cui2020The). 

In the context of HIV, the CCR2 V64I polymorphism is associated with delayed progression to AIDS, particularly in African populations. This polymorphism affects susceptibility to HIV and disease progression, highlighting CCR2's role in HIV-associated chronic inflammation (Petersen2002Novel; Fantuzzi2019Dual). 

CCR2 also plays a role in hepatic fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The CCL2/CCR2 axis is involved in recruiting monocytes and promoting tumor-associated macrophage maturation, which is linked to poor prognosis in HCC. Inhibition of this axis has shown promise in reducing tumor growth and metastasis in HCC models (Fantuzzi2019Dual). 

These findings suggest that targeting CCR2 could be a potential therapeutic strategy for these conditions.

## Interactions
CCR2 (C-C motif chemokine receptor 2) is a G protein-coupled receptor that primarily interacts with its endogenous ligand CCL2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) to mediate immune cell migration. The interaction between CCR2 and CCL2 follows a 'two-site' model, where the N-terminus of CCR2 forms hydrophobic and hydrogen bonds with CCL2 at chemokine recognition site 1 (CRS1), and CCL2's N-terminus deeply inserts into the transmembrane domain (TMD) pocket at chemokine recognition site 2 (CRS2), forming hydrogen bonds with specific residues of CCR2 (Shao2022Molecular).

CCR2 also forms complexes with G-proteins, particularly Gαi, which are crucial for signal transduction. The interactions between CCR2 and Gαi are concentrated in the intracellular loop 2 (ICL2) and the intracellular ends of transmembrane helices TM3, TM5, and TM6. Specific residues in these regions form electrostatic, hydrogen, and hydrophobic interactions with Gαi, which are essential for G-protein coupling and activation (Shao2022Molecular).

Additionally, CCR2 can be inhibited by a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) that targets its extracellular loop 2 (ECL2). This scFv binds to ECL2, disrupting the CCR2-CCL2 interaction and inhibiting macrophage migration and polarization, which are processes important in inflammatory conditions and cancer metastasis (Jasiewicz2023Discovery).
