# ZSCAN21

## Overview
ZSCAN21 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger and SCAN domain containing 21 protein, which functions as a transcription factor. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger motifs and a SCAN domain, which facilitate DNA binding and protein-protein interactions, respectively. ZSCAN21 plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression, particularly influencing the transcription of the SNCA gene, which encodes α-synuclein, a protein implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease. The protein's activity is modulated through interactions with other proteins, including TRIM17 and TRIM41, which affect its stability via ubiquitination. Variants in the ZSCAN21 gene have been associated with altered α-synuclein expression and are considered potential risk factors for Parkinson's disease, highlighting its clinical significance in neurodegenerative disease research (Gialluisi2021Identification; Clough2009Functional; Lassot2018The).

## Structure
ZSCAN21 is a protein characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs and a SCAN domain, which are integral to its function as a transcription factor. The zinc finger motifs are small structural motifs that stabilize their folds by coordinating zinc ions, facilitating DNA binding (Lassot2018The). The SCAN domain is a protein-protein interaction domain, suggesting a role in mediating interactions with other proteins (Bai2021Proteome‐Wide).

The protein's structure includes a C-terminal region containing seven zinc fingers, which are crucial for its interaction with other proteins, such as TRIM17 and TRIM41 (Lassot2018The). Deletion of this region abrogates these interactions, highlighting the importance of the zinc finger domain in its functional activity (Lassot2018The).

ZSCAN21 is subject to post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination, which is mediated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM41, leading to its proteasomal degradation (Lassot2018The). This modification plays a significant role in regulating the protein's stability and function. The protein may also exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context (Dermentzaki2016Complex).

## Function
ZSCAN21 is a transcription factor involved in the regulation of the SNCA gene, which encodes the α-synuclein protein. This protein is crucial for synaptic neurotransmission and is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease. ZSCAN21 binds to a specific site within intron 1 of the SNCA gene, influencing its transcriptional activity (Clough2009Functional). The binding site is responsive to neurotrophic factors like NGF and bFGF, which suggests that ZSCAN21 plays a role in mediating the transcriptional response to these factors in healthy human cells (Clough2009Functional).

ZSCAN21's activity is modulated by its interaction with other proteins, such as TRIM17 and TRIM41, which regulate its stability through ubiquitination. TRIM41 acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, promoting ZSCAN21 degradation, while TRIM17 stabilizes it, thereby affecting SNCA expression levels (Lassot2018The). In neuronal cells, ZSCAN21 can act as both an activator and a repressor of SNCA transcription, depending on the cellular context and developmental stage (Dermentzaki2016Complex). This dual role highlights its complex regulatory function in maintaining synuclein balance, which is essential for normal cellular function and may have implications for neurodegenerative disease pathology (Wright2013Counterregulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ZSCAN21 gene have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). ZSCAN21 is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of the SNCA gene, which encodes α-synuclein, a protein associated with PD. Variants in ZSCAN21, such as the p.V5I mutation, have been shown to increase the stability of the ZSCAN21 protein, leading to higher α-synuclein expression, which may contribute to PD pathogenesis (Lassot2018The). This variant is associated with increased toxicity in cells, suggesting a potential pathogenic role (Lassot2018The).

In familial cases of PD, the ZSCAN21 c.13 G > A, p.V5I variant has been found to co-segregate with the disease, indicating its potential clinical significance (Lassot2018The). The study also identified rare exonic variants in ZSCAN21 in PD patients, suggesting these genetic changes could be risk factors for the disease (Lassot2018The).

ZSCAN21 has also been identified as a novel candidate gene for late-onset PD, with specific mutations potentially affecting SNCA expression and influencing PD onset or progression (Gialluisi2021Identification). The presence of rare variants in ZSCAN21 was more common in PD patients than in controls, supporting its role in PD etiopathogenesis (Gialluisi2021Identification).

## Interactions
ZSCAN21 is a transcription factor that interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in gene regulation. It specifically binds to a conserved consensus-binding element, AGTAC, located in the 5'-region of intron 1 of the SNCA gene, promoting its transcription in neuronal cells (Lassot2018The). This interaction is confirmed through oligonucleotide pull-down assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) (Lassot2018The).

ZSCAN21 also interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligases TRIM17 and TRIM41. TRIM41 acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for ZSCAN21, promoting its ubiquitination and degradation, while TRIM17 inhibits this activity, stabilizing ZSCAN21 (Lassot2018The). The zinc finger domain of ZSCAN21 is crucial for its interaction with both TRIM17 and TRIM41 (Lassot2018The). TRIM17's inhibitory effect on TRIM41 does not require its RING domain, suggesting a unique mechanism of action (Lassot2018The).

These interactions are significant in the context of α-synuclein expression, which is implicated in Parkinson's disease. Variants of ZSCAN21 and TRIM41 have been associated with increased α-synuclein expression, highlighting the importance of these interactions in disease pathogenesis (Lassot2018The).
