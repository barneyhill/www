# AMACR

## Overview
The AMACR gene encodes the enzyme alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase, which is a crucial component in the metabolism of branched-chain fatty acids and bile acid intermediates. This enzyme, categorized as a racemase, facilitates the racemization of specific CoA esters, enabling their further processing through the β-oxidation pathway. AMACR is predominantly active in peroxisomes and mitochondria, where it plays a vital role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis by preventing the toxic accumulation of branched-chain fatty acids. The gene is known for producing several alternatively spliced variants, which may have distinct functions and localizations, particularly in pathological contexts such as prostate cancer. Alterations in AMACR expression and function are linked to various diseases, including metabolic disorders and several types of cancer, where it is often overexpressed and serves as a biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis (Kong2020Current; Rubin2002αMethylacyl; Mubiru2004Alternative).

## Structure
The alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) protein is involved in the metabolism of branched-chain fatty acids and bile acid intermediates. The primary structure of AMACR consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the AMACR gene. The secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure refers to the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity, although specific details on this structure are not provided in the available context.

AMACR may form homodimers, indicating a quaternary structure, which is important for its function in catalyzing the racemization of specific CoA esters. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are known to occur, potentially affecting the protein's activity and stability (Kong2020Current).

The AMACR gene produces several alternatively spliced variants, including IA, IIA, IB, IIB, and IIAs, which differ in their exon composition and resulting protein structure. These variants may have different subcellular localizations and functions, particularly in the context of prostate cancer (Mubiru2004Alternative). The presence of these splice variants suggests a complex regulation of AMACR activity in different tissues and conditions.

## Function
The α-methyl acyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) enzyme is crucial for the metabolism of branched-chain fatty acids and bile acids in human cells. It catalyzes the racemization of α-methyl branched carboxylic acid coenzyme A thioesters, converting (2R)-methyl branched-chain fatty acyl-CoA into (S)-stereoisomers. This conversion is essential for these stereoisomers to proceed through the β-oxidation pathway, a key process in oxidative metabolism and biosynthesis (Kong2020Current). AMACR is active in both peroxisomes and mitochondria, with a significant portion of its activity in human cells occurring in peroxisomes (Kong2020Current).

In healthy cells, AMACR is involved in the metabolism of bile acid intermediates, with natural substrates including pristanoyl coenzyme A and trihydroxy cholestanoyl coenzyme A. Its activity is crucial for the chain shortening process during β-oxidation, maintaining normal levels of branched-chain fatty acids and preventing their toxic accumulation, which can lead to conditions like neuropathy and other metabolic disorders (Kong2020Current). The enzyme also plays a role in the hydroxylation and degradation of cholesterol derivatives, contributing to the biosynthesis of bile acids (Kong2020Current).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the AMACR gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. AMACR deficiency, resulting from mutations such as c.154T>C and c.559G>A, is linked to neurological and metabolic symptoms, including axonal neuropathy, recurrent seizures, cognitive decline, and metabolic stroke-like episodes. These mutations can lead to elevated pristanic acid levels, a biochemical marker of AMACR deficiency, and symptoms like cataracts, optic atrophy, tremor, depression, and schizophrenia (Tanti2022Late).

In cancer, AMACR is significantly overexpressed in various types, including prostate, colorectal, breast, ovarian, and renal cell carcinomas. This overexpression is particularly notable in prostate cancer, where it serves as a biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis (Rubin2002αMethylacyl; Zhou2002AlphaMethylacylCoA). The enzyme's overexpression is linked to increased tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis in cancers like myxofibrosarcomas, where it promotes cell proliferation (Li2014AMACRAmplification).

AMACR's role in cancer is also associated with its involvement in the metabolism of branched-chain fatty acids, which can lead to oxidative stress and DNA damage, contributing to tumorigenesis (Kong2020Current). Its expression is correlated with androgen receptor signaling, crucial for prostate cancer development (Kong2020Current).
