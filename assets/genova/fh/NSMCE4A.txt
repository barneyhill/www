# NSMCE4A

## Overview
NSMCE4A is a gene that encodes the NSE4 homolog A, a crucial component of the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) 5/6 complex. This protein plays a significant role in maintaining genomic stability by participating in DNA damage repair processes, particularly through homologous recombination repair of DNA double-strand breaks. As a kleisin subunit, NSE4 homolog A bridges the ATPase head/tail domains of SMC5 and SMC6, facilitating the complex's function in DNA replication and response to replication stress. It is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it ensures proper chromosome segregation during mitosis and meiosis. Additionally, NSE4 homolog A interacts with components of the COP9 signalosome complex, suggesting a broader role in cell cycle progression and DNA damage response (Atkins2020SMC56; Horváth2020Interaction).

## Function
NSMCE4A is a component of the SMC5/6 complex, which plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability in human cells. This complex is involved in DNA damage repair, particularly through homologous recombination repair (HRR) of DNA double-strand breaks. NSMCE4A facilitates the SUMOylation of cohesin, ensuring its stability around DNA breaks, which is essential for effective DNA repair and chromosome segregation during mitosis and meiosis (Horváth2020Interaction).

NSMCE4A acts as the kleisin subunit of the SMC5/6 complex, bridging the ATPase head/tail domains of SMC5 and SMC6. It interacts with other components of the complex, such as NSMCE1 and NSMCE3, and is crucial for the complex's function in DNA replication and response to replication stress (Atkins2020SMC56). The protein is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the proper functioning of cell division and genome integrity (Horváth2020Interaction).

NSMCE4A also interacts with GPS1, a component of the COP9 signalosome (CSN) complex, suggesting a role in linking the SMC5/6 complex to the CSN complex. This interaction may influence the SMC5/6 functions during cell cycle progression and response to DNA damage (Horváth2020Interaction).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NSMCE4A gene have been associated with various clinical conditions. A study identified NSMCE4A as part of a microdeletion in the 10q26.11-q26.13 region, which is linked to intellectual disability, growth and psychomotor retardation, and microcephaly in patients (Choucair2015Contribution). This microdeletion syndrome is characterized by neurodevelopmental impairment and other physical anomalies, suggesting that NSMCE4A plays a role in these developmental disorders (Choucair201510q26.1).

In the context of cancer, NSMCE4A has been implicated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where its high expression is associated with a favorable prognosis, indicating its potential role in DNA damage repair pathways that influence cancer outcomes (Li2022A). Additionally, NSMCE4A was identified as the most deregulated gene in refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS), being significantly down-regulated, which may contribute to genomic instability observed in this condition (nikpour2010gene).

The interaction of NSMCE4A with the SMC5/6 complex is crucial for DNA repair processes, and disruptions in these interactions could lead to defects in DNA repair and chromosome segregation, potentially contributing to genomic instability and related diseases (Horváth2020Interaction).

## Interactions
NSMCE4A, a component of the SMC5/6 complex, is involved in DNA damage repair and chromosome segregation. It interacts with GPS1, a component of the COP9 signalosome (CSN) complex. This interaction was identified using yeast two-hybrid screening and confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and colocalization studies. The interaction is stronger when the C-terminal half of GPS1, containing the PCI motif, is present (Horváth2020Interaction). NSMCE4A predominantly localizes in the nucleus, but when co-expressed with GPS1, it colocalizes with GPS1 in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, suggesting that GPS1 affects the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of NSMCE4A (Horváth2020Interaction).

The interaction between NSMCE4A and GPS1 links the SMC5/6 complex to the CSN complex, influencing the localization and function of SMC5/6 during the DNA damage response. Depletion of GPS1 or inhibition of CSN's deNEDDylation function increases SMC5/6 levels at DNA damage sites, indicating that the CSN complex modulates SMC5/6 functions during cell cycle progression and DNA damage response (Horváth2020Interaction). NSMCE4A also colocalizes with SMC6 and CSN5, another component of the CSN complex, during interphase and mitosis, highlighting its role in DNA repair and chromosome segregation (Horváth2020Interaction).
