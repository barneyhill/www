# HIGD1A

## Overview
HIGD1A is a gene that encodes the protein HIG1 hypoxia inducible domain family member 1A, which is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein involved in the regulation of mitochondrial respiratory function. The protein is characterized by its two hydrophilic transmembrane domains and an amphiphilic N-terminal helix, which are structural features that facilitate its role in signal transduction across membranes. HIGD1A is part of the HIGD protein family and is particularly responsive to hypoxic and stress conditions, where it plays a crucial role in the biogenesis and assembly of mitochondrial respiratory complexes, such as Complex III and Complex IV, and their organization into supercomplexes. This protein enhances cytochrome c oxidase activity, thereby supporting ATP production and energy homeostasis. Additionally, HIGD1A exhibits anti-apoptotic properties by inhibiting cytochrome C release and reducing caspase activation. Its expression is upregulated under stress conditions, contributing to cellular survival and adaptation (Ameri2013Nuclear; Nagao2019Higd1a; TimónGómez2020HIGDDriven).

## Structure
The HIGD1A protein is a mitochondrial protein localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane. It is characterized by two hydrophilic transmembrane domains and an amphiphilic N-terminal helix, which is oriented parallel to the membrane surface (TimónGómez2020HIGDDriven). The transmembrane domains are loosely packed, with interhelical distances exceeding 8 Å, and have few van der Waals contacts at the ends of the helices, a structural feature common in proteins involved in signal transduction across membranes (TimónGómez2020HIGDDriven). The C-terminal domain of HIGD1A is unfolded and exhibits significant fluctuations in its orientation (TimónGómez2020HIGDDriven).

HIGD1A contains an N-terminal HIG1 domain and is part of the HIGD protein family, which includes type 1 and type 2 isoforms. Type 1 proteins, like HIGD1A, are induced by hypoxia and stress (TimónGómez2020HIGDDriven). The protein's structure has been determined using solution NMR, and it includes a truncated QRRQ motif (TimónGómez2020HIGDDriven). While specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not provided, the protein's role in mitochondrial function and its structural characteristics suggest its involvement in cytochrome c oxidase activity modulation (TimónGómez2020HIGDDriven).

## Function
HIGD1A is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial function and integrity in healthy human cells. It is involved in the biogenesis and assembly of mitochondrial respiratory complexes, particularly Complex III (CIII) and Complex IV (CIV), and their organization into supercomplexes (SCs) (TimónGómez2020Distinct). HIGD1A promotes the incorporation of the UQCRFS1 subunit into the CIII dimer, which is essential for the catalytic activity of CIII (TimónGómez2020Distinct). It also interacts with early-assembly subunits of CIV, such as COX4-1 and COX5A, facilitating its biogenesis (TimónGómez2020Distinct).

HIGD1A enhances cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) activity, the last enzyme in the electron transport chain, thereby increasing ATP production and supporting energy homeostasis through oxidative phosphorylation (Nagao2019Higd1a). It exhibits anti-apoptotic effects by inhibiting cytochrome C release and reducing caspase activation, which are key processes in apoptosis (Ameri2013Nuclear). Under stress conditions, such as hypoxia, HIGD1A expression is upregulated, contributing to cellular survival and adaptation (TimónGómez2020Distinct).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the HIGD1A gene have been implicated in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Elevated expression of HIGD1A is observed in HCC tumor tissues compared to adjacent non-tumor liver tissues, and this increase is associated with hypoxia or low-glucose conditions. The elevated expression is linked to aberrant epigenetic regulation, particularly through changes in DNA methylation, as lower methylation levels of the HIGD1A promoter region are found in HCC tissues (Zhang2024Elevated). HIGD1A contributes to HCC progression by regulating polyamine metabolism through the c-Myc–ODC1 nexus, influencing cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Knockdown of HIGD1A results in reduced tumor growth and decreased expression of c-Myc and ODC1, indicating its oncogenic role in HCC (Zhang2024Elevated).

In the context of mitochondrial disorders, HIGD1A overexpression has been shown to improve respiratory function. It acts as a positive modulator of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) activity, enhancing mitochondrial ATP production and cell viability under hypoxic conditions. This suggests potential therapeutic applications for HIGD1A in treating mitochondrial diseases characterized by impaired respiratory chain activity (Nagao2019Higd1a).

## Interactions
HIGD1A is known to interact with several components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, particularly cytochrome c oxidase (CIV). It forms part of an early assembly cluster with COX4-1 and COX5A, although it does not replace the function of Rcf proteins in yeast. HIGD1A enhances CIV activity by interacting with cytochrome c and CIV, facilitating electron transfer between Complex III and CIV, and altering the active center of CIV. This interaction has been confirmed through immunoprecipitation assays and isothermal titration calorimetry (TimónGómez2020HIGDDriven).

Recombinant rat Higd1a has been shown to interact with bovine CIV, causing a conformational change in the enzyme's catalytic core, as demonstrated by resonance Raman spectroscopy. This interaction increases CIV activity by converting heme a from a low-spin to a high-spin state, affecting the proton-pumping pathway (TimónGómez2020HIGDDriven). HIGD1A also binds to cytochrome c oxidase, increasing the Vmax of the reaction between cytochrome c oxidase and cytochrome c, indicating its role as a positive modulator of cytochrome c oxidase (Nagao2019Higd1a). These interactions suggest that HIGD1A plays a significant role in modulating mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and respiratory function.
