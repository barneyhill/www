# RALYL

## Overview
RALYL is a gene that encodes the RALY RNA Binding Protein-like, a member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, primarily through its interactions with RNA and other proteins. RALYL plays a significant role in the regulation of mRNA stability and expression, impacting pathways such as TGF-β2 signaling and the PI3K/AKT and STAT3 pathways, which are crucial for cellular growth and survival (Wang2021RALYL). Additionally, RALYL is implicated in the progression of certain cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma and glioma, by stabilizing specific mRNAs that promote tumor growth and angiogenesis (Cao2023SUMOylation). Beyond oncology, RALYL has clinical significance in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, where its expression levels are associated with disease progression and cognitive decline (Zhang2020Exploring).

## Clinical Significance
The RALYL gene, which encodes the RALY RNA Binding Protein-like, has been implicated in several diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). In the context of AD, RALYL is identified as a hub gene associated with cognitive decline and reserve phenotypes. Its expression is significantly altered in AD neurons, showing a bifurcated trajectory with one path linked to AD progression. Higher RALYL expression is associated with slower cognitive decline, suggesting a role in cognitive resilience and AD reserve (Zhang2020Exploring). In AD, RALYL expression decreases during the transition from moderate to severe stages, and lower levels are observed in individuals with mild cognitive impairment and AD dementia compared to those with no cognitive impairment (Zhang2020Exploring).

RALYL is also associated with other neurodegenerative diseases. Its expression is lower in brain samples from individuals with PD compared to controls, and it has been implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis through genome-wide association studies (Zhang2020Exploring). Although RALYL is mentioned in the context of neurodevelopmental disorders, specific diseases or conditions directly resulting from mutations in RALYL are not detailed in the provided context (Gillentine2021Rare).

## Interactions
RALYL, a protein from the hnRNP family, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence its role in cellular processes. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), RALYL interacts with TGF-β2 mRNA, enhancing its stability by binding to its 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR) and reducing m6A modifications, which are known to destabilize mRNA. This interaction is facilitated by the fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO), an m6A eraser, suggesting a cooperative role in maintaining TGF-β2 mRNA stability (Wang2021RALYL). RALYL also interacts with the PI3K/AKT and STAT3 signaling pathways, promoting the phosphorylation of AKT and STAT3, which are downstream targets of TGF-β2 signaling (Wang2021RALYL).

In glioma cells, RALYL binds to FOXD1 mRNA, stabilizing it and promoting its expression. This interaction is crucial for the malignant progression of glioma cells, as FOXD1 enhances the activity of the DKK1 promoter, which is associated with tumor growth and angiogenesis (Cao2023SUMOylation). RALYL's stability and expression are increased through SUMOylation, a modification facilitated by UBA2, which further enhances its interaction with FOXD1 (Cao2023SUMOylation).
