# PIAS1

## Overview
PIAS1 (Protein Inhibitor of Activated STAT 1) is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in the regulation of various cellular processes, primarily through its role as a transcriptional co-regulator and SUMO E3 ligase. The PIAS1 protein is characterized by several structural domains, including the SAP motif, PINIT domain, and SP-RING domain, which facilitate its interactions with DNA and other proteins, as well as its ability to mediate post-translational modifications such as sumoylation (Okubo2004NMR). Functionally, PIAS1 modulates the activity of transcription factors like STAT1, NF-κB, and nuclear receptors, impacting processes such as immune response, inflammation, and cell cycle regulation (Liu2005Negative; Liu1998Inhibition). Clinically, alterations in PIAS1 expression and function are implicated in various cancers, where it influences tumor progression and metastasis through its regulatory effects on gene expression and protein interactions (Li2024PIAS; Liu2014PIAS1).

## Structure
The PIAS1 protein is characterized by several distinct structural domains that contribute to its function as a transcriptional co-regulator and SUMO E3 ligase. The N-terminal domain of PIAS1, comprising residues 1-65, forms a unique four-helix bundle structure, as determined by NMR spectroscopy. This domain includes the SAP motif, which is crucial for DNA binding and is composed of a helix-extended loop-helix structure (Okubo2004NMR). The four helices are identified as α1 (residues 5-11), α2 (residues 15-22), α3 (residues 33-46), and α4 (residues 51-63), with a topology described as up-down-extended loop-down-up (Okubo2004NMR).

The SAP motif within this domain is involved in chromosomal organization and nuclear body association, and it plays a role in DNA binding, particularly to A/T-rich sequences (Okubo2004NMR). PIAS1 also contains other conserved domains, such as the PINIT domain, which is involved in nuclear retention, and the SP-RING domain, which facilitates its SUMO E3 ligase activity. These domains contribute to the protein's ability to mediate post-translational modifications like sumoylation, influencing its interactions and functional conformation (Okubo2004NMR).

## Function
PIAS1 (Protein Inhibitor of Activated STAT 1) is a multifunctional protein that plays a significant role in regulating various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It primarily functions as a transcriptional coregulator, modulating the activity of transcription factors such as STAT1, NF-κB, and nuclear receptors like the androgen receptor (AR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (Liu2005Negative; Tan2000Protein; Liu1998Inhibition).

PIAS1 exerts its regulatory effects through SUMOylation, a post-translational modification process that alters the activity of target proteins. For instance, PIAS1 sumoylates p73, a member of the p53 family, affecting cell cycle progression by reducing p73's transcriptional activity and promoting cell cycle reentry (Munarriz2004PIAS1). In the immune system, PIAS1 negatively regulates STAT1 by inhibiting its DNA-binding activity, thus modulating cytokine signaling and preventing overactive immune responses (Shuai2005Regulation; Liu1998Inhibition).

PIAS1 also interacts with the p65 subunit of NF-κB, inhibiting its transcriptional activity and thereby controlling inflammatory responses (Liu2005Negative). In the testis, PIAS1 acts as a coactivator for AR and GR, enhancing their transcriptional activities and playing a role in spermatogenesis (Tan2000Protein). Through these diverse interactions, PIAS1 is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating gene expression in various biological contexts.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the PIAS1 gene have significant clinical implications in various cancers. In breast cancer, PIAS1 is upregulated and contributes to tumor progression by silencing genes through epigenetic modifications, such as histone modifications and DNA methylation. Knockdown of PIAS1 in breast cancer cells has been shown to reduce tumor growth and the population of tumor-initiating cells, indicating its role in tumorigenesis (Liu2014PIAS1). PIAS1 also extends the half-life of AIB1, a protein involved in estrogen receptor-mediated gene expression, and its SUMOylation activity inhibits AIB1, suggesting a potential therapeutic target (Li2024PIAS).

In prostate cancer, PIAS1 acts as a coregulator of androgen receptor (AR) signaling, enhancing AR stabilization and activity, which is crucial for cancer progression. High PIAS1 levels are associated with poor survival outcomes and a higher risk of biochemical recurrence post-prostatectomy (Puhr2015PIAS1). PIAS1's interaction with MYC, a transcriptional activator, promotes carcinogenic activity in lymphomas and other cancers, with its inhibition inducing apoptosis in MYC-dependent lymphoma cells (Rabellino2016PIAS1).

PIAS1 is also involved in the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that facilitates cancer metastasis, particularly in breast cancer (Li2024PIAS). Its overexpression has been reported in lung cancer, osteosarcoma, and endometrial cancer, where it may hinder tumor suppressor activity and promote cancer progression (Li2024PIAS).

## Interactions
PIAS1 interacts with a variety of proteins, influencing numerous cellular processes. It is known to interact with the transcription factor p53, enhancing p53-mediated gene expression and promoting p53-dependent G1 cell cycle arrest. This interaction occurs with the tetramerization and C-terminal regulatory domains of p53, and is significant for cell cycle regulation and response to DNA damage (Megidish2002Activation).

PIAS1 also interacts with the transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5), facilitating co-localization to transcriptionally active sites within the nucleus. This interaction is mediated by the carboxyl-terminal region of PIAS1 and is involved in regulating cell growth and development (Du2007Protein).

In the context of cytokine signaling, PIAS1 interacts with STAT1, inhibiting its DNA-binding activity and gene activation. This interaction is specific to STAT1 and occurs in a ligand-dependent manner, particularly after IFN-α treatment (Liu1998Inhibition).

PIAS1 also interacts with the p65 subunit of NF-κB, repressing its transcriptional activity by interfering with its DNA-binding ability. This interaction affects the recruitment of p65 to NF-κB target gene promoters, impacting inflammatory responses (Shuai2005Regulation).
