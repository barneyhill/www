# CCNO

## Overview
Cyclin O (CCNO) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the cyclin family, which plays a pivotal role in cell cycle regulation and multiciliogenesis. The protein product, cyclin O, is integral to the development and function of multiciliated cells, particularly in the respiratory tract, where it facilitates the movement of fluids across epithelial surfaces. Cyclin O is involved in the formation and maintenance of the deuterosome, a structure essential for centriole amplification and basal body formation, which are critical for ciliary axoneme elongation (NúnezOllé2017Constitutive; Villa2016The). The gene's expression is regulated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which binds to the CCNO promoter, highlighting its role in response to environmental stimuli (Villa2016The). Mutations in CCNO are associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia, a genetic disorder characterized by defective cilia and chronic respiratory conditions (Henriques2021Primary). Additionally, CCNO has been implicated in various cancers, where its altered expression can influence cell proliferation and apoptosis (Li2018Knockdown).

## Function
Cyclin O (CCNO) is a crucial protein involved in the regulation of multiciliogenesis, the process by which epithelial cells develop multiple motile cilia. These cilia are essential for the movement of fluids across epithelial surfaces, such as in the respiratory tract, where they facilitate mucociliary clearance (Villa2016The). CCNO is directly targeted by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which binds to the CCNO promoter to induce its expression, particularly in response to air exposure. This induction is necessary for the proper development of multiciliated cells (Villa2016The).

In healthy human cells, CCNO is involved in the formation and maintenance of the deuterosome, a structure required for centriole amplification and basal body formation in multiciliated cells. This process is critical for the elongation of ciliary axonemes, which are the structural components of cilia (NúnezOllé2017Constitutive). CCNO's role in multiciliogenesis is tightly regulated by transcriptional programs that ensure the correct differentiation and function of multiciliated cells, which are vital for maintaining normal lung physiology and preventing respiratory diseases (Gasa2017A; Villa2016The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CCNO gene are linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a condition characterized by defective cilia leading to chronic respiratory issues, bronchiectasis, and infertility. Patients with CCNO mutations often present with neonatal respiratory distress, chronic cough, rhinosinusitis, and otitis media. The condition is due to a failure in the amplification and migration of centrioles, resulting in a reduced number of motile cilia, known as reduced generation of multiple motile cilia (RGMC) (Henriques2021Primary; Tong2024Case; Shapiro2017Value). 

In mouse models, CCNO deficiency leads to severe hydrocephalus, impaired growth, and infertility, suggesting similar potential effects in humans. The hydrocephalus is attributed to impaired cerebrospinal fluid reabsorption due to a lack of ciliated cells in the ependymal epithelium (NúnezOllé2017Constitutive). 

Alterations in CCNO expression have also been implicated in gastric cancer. The gene is upregulated in gastric cancer tissues, and its knockdown results in decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis, indicating that CCNO may function as an oncogene in this context (Li2018Knockdown). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CCNO in both genetic disorders and cancer.

## Interactions
Cyclin O (CCNO) is involved in several interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. In oocyte meiotic progression, CCNO interacts with CDK1, a cyclin-dependent kinase, to regulate the maturation-promoting factor (MPF) necessary for meiotic resumption. Knockdown of CCNO inhibits the dephosphorylation of CDK1 (Tyr15), leading to an arrest at the germinal vesicle stage, indicating a critical role in MPF activation (Li2019Cyclins).

In the context of multiciliogenesis, CCNO is regulated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which binds directly to the CCNO promoter to induce its expression. This interaction is essential for the formation of motile cilia in epithelial tissues, as demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays (Villa2016The).

CCNO is also implicated in the regulation of apoptosis in cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC). It is targeted by microRNAs miR-302b-3p, miR-302c-3p, and miR-302d-3p, which downregulate its expression, leading to increased apoptosis and decreased cell proliferation. This interaction is part of a regulatory axis involving RACK1, which promotes the expression of these microRNAs (Wang2020RACK1).
