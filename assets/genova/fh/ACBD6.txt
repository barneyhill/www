# ACBD6

## Overview
The ACBD6 gene encodes the acyl-CoA binding domain containing 6 protein, which is a crucial component in lipid metabolism and protein modification processes. This protein is characterized by its acyl-CoA binding domain and a carboxy-terminal domain with ankyrin-repeat motifs, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, particularly with N-myristoyltransferase enzymes (Soupene2016Association). ACBD6 plays a significant role in the acylation remodeling of lipids and proteins, ensuring the proper function and membrane association of proteins through the regulation of N-myristoylation (Soupene2020Requirement). It is expressed in various tissues, including hematopoietic progenitor cells, and is involved in critical cellular processes such as mitosis and apoptosis (Soupene2008Characterization). Mutations in the ACBD6 gene are linked to a neurodevelopmental syndrome, highlighting its importance in neurological development and function (Kaiyrzhanov2023Biallelic).

## Structure
The ACBD6 protein is characterized by its acyl-CoA binding domain (ACBD) and a carboxy-terminal domain containing two ankyrin-repeat motifs. The primary structure of human ACBD6 includes serine residues at positions 106 and 108, which are phosphorylated in vivo and play a regulatory role in ligand binding (Soupene2019ACBD6). The secondary structure features multiple α helices, with the acyl-CoA ligand binding in a cavity formed by αH1, αH2, and αH4. The CoA headgroup is positioned near αH2 and αH3 (Soupene2019ACBD6).

Site-directed mutagenesis has identified two aromatic residues, Phe46 in αH1 and Tyr114 in αH4, as critical for acyl-CoA binding, suggesting their importance in the tertiary structure by protruding into the acyl-chain binding cavity (Soupene2019ACBD6; Soupene2015Ligand). The ankyrin-repeat motifs in the C-terminal domain are crucial for protein-protein interactions, particularly with N-myristoyltransferase 2 (NMT2), forming a hetero-dimeric complex (Soupene2016Association).

ACBD6 does not oligomerize upon ligand binding, unlike other ACBD family members, and behaves as a monomeric protein in solution (Soupene2016Association; Soupene2015Ligand). The phosphorylation of serine residues enhances ligand binding capacity, indicating a dynamic structure-function relationship (Soupene2019ACBD6).

## Function
The ACBD6 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism and protein modification in human cells. ACBD6 is involved in the acylation remodeling of lipids and proteins, particularly by channeling acyl-CoAs to acyltransferase enzymes, which acylate lysophospholipids to phospholipids. This process is essential for maintaining membrane integrity and protecting proteins from the detergent-like properties of free acyl-CoAs (Soupene2022Dual). 

ACBD6 also regulates the N-myristoylation of proteins, a modification important for protein function and membrane association. It interacts with N-myristoyltransferase (NMT) enzymes, enhancing their activity by ensuring the availability of myristoyl-CoA and protecting the enzyme from competition by other acyl-CoAs (Soupene2019ACBD6; Soupene2020Requirement). This interaction is crucial for the proper function of proteins and is particularly important during cellular processes such as mitosis and apoptosis (Soupene2019ACBD6).

ACBD6 is expressed in various tissues, including hematopoietic progenitor cells, where it may serve as a marker for primitive progenitor cells involved in blood and vessel development (Soupene2008Characterization). Its activity is regulated by phosphorylation, which enhances its ligand binding capacity and supports NMT activity (Soupene2019ACBD6).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ACBD6 gene are associated with a distinct neurodevelopmental syndrome characterized by progressive and complex movement disorders. This syndrome includes symptoms such as moderate-to-severe global developmental delay or intellectual disability, significant expressive language impairment, dystonia, facial dysmorphism, cerebellar ataxia, gait impairment, limb spasticity, oculomotor and behavioral abnormalities, overweight, microcephaly, and epilepsy. Neuroimaging often reveals midline brain malformations, including corpus callosum abnormalities and hypoplasia of the anterior commissure (Kaiyrzhanov2023Biallelic).

The condition is linked to bi-allelic pathogenic variants in ACBD6, which lead to alterations in N-myristoylation, a process crucial for protein function and stability. ACBD6 interacts with N-myristoyltransferase enzymes, and its deficiency results in reduced myristoylation of proteins, contributing to the pathophysiology of the associated syndrome (Kaiyrzhanov2023Biallelic; Soupene2022Dual).

Animal models, such as zebrafish and Xenopus tropicalis, have been used to replicate the clinical phenotypes observed in humans, confirming the role of ACBD6 in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative processes. These models exhibit similar phenotypes, including movement disorders, seizures, and brain development issues (Kaiyrzhanov2023Biallelic).

## Interactions
ACBD6 interacts with N-myristoyltransferase enzymes, specifically NMT1 and NMT2, with a stronger affinity for NMT2. This interaction is crucial for the N-myristoylation process, where ACBD6 enhances the activity of NMT2 by promoting the use of myristoyl-CoA over other acyl-CoA species, such as palmitoyl-CoA, which could otherwise compete for binding (Soupene2016Association). The interaction between ACBD6 and NMT2 is facilitated by the ankyrin-repeat motifs in the C-terminal domain of ACBD6, which bind to the C-terminal region of NMT2, forming a heterodimeric complex (Soupene2016Association).

ACBD6 also interacts with Plasmodium falciparum NMT (PfNMT), although this interaction is weaker compared to NMT2. The ankyrin-repeat motifs are essential for these interactions, as a truncated form of ACBD6 lacking these motifs does not associate with either PfNMT or NMT2 (Soupene2019ACBD6). The interaction with NMT2 is particularly important for protecting the enzyme from competitive inhibition by C16-CoA, ensuring the specificity of the myristoylation reaction (Soupene2020Requirement; Soupene2016Association). The phosphorylation of serine residues in ACBD6 enhances its ligand-binding capacity, further supporting NMT activity (Soupene2019ACBD6).
