# STK32A

## Overview
STK32A is a gene that encodes the protein serine/threonine kinase 32A, a member of the AGC kinase family known for its dual-specificity in phosphorylating serine/threonine and tyrosine residues. The protein is characterized by its preference for acidic substrates and is primarily expressed in brain and endocrine tissues, where it localizes to the centrosome, suggesting a role in cellular organization and signaling (Sorrell2020STK32A). Structurally, STK32A features a unique hydrophobic motif and a small valine gatekeeper residue in its ATP-binding site, which allows it to interact with various kinase inhibitors (Sorrell2020STK32A). Despite its involvement in several cellular processes and disease associations, including cancer and autoimmune disorders, STK32A remains a "dark kinase" with many aspects of its function and regulation yet to be fully understood (Sorrell2020STK32A; Jia2023The).

## Structure
The STK32A protein is a dual-specificity AGC kinase with a preference for acidic substrates. Its molecular structure includes typical features of the AGC kinase family, such as an N-terminal lobe with beta-strands and alpha-helices, and a mostly helical C-terminal lobe. The ATP binding site is located between these lobes (Sorrell2020STK32A). Unique to STK32A is a hydrophobic motif (HF motif) that binds differently to the N-lobe compared to other AGC kinases, suggesting it does not require activating phosphorylation on the C-terminal tail for activation (Sorrell2020STK32A).

The protein also features a basic sequence following the traditional turn motif, which may interact with an acidic patch on the N-lobe (Sorrell2020STK32A). The substrate binding groove contains basic residues, which may explain its preference for acidic substrates (Sorrell2020STK32A). STK32A is monomeric in both unphosphorylated and auto-phosphorylated states, with a compact and rigid conformation (Sorrell2020STK32A).

STK32A shares significant sequence identity with its homologues STK32B and STK32C, but only 36% with its next closest homologues, indicating a degree of evolutionary conservation (Sorrell2020STK32A).

## Function
STK32A, a serine/threonine kinase, is part of the AGC kinase family and exhibits dual-specificity for phosphorylating serine/threonine and tyrosine residues, with a preference for acidic substrates (Sorrell2020STK32A). This kinase is primarily expressed in brain and endocrine tissues and is localized to the centrosome, suggesting a role in cellular organization and signaling (Sorrell2020STK32A). The unique structural features of STK32A, such as its small valine gatekeeper residue in the ATP-binding site, allow it to bind various kinase inhibitors, indicating potential for selective inhibition (Sorrell2020STK32A).

STK32A is involved in the phosphorylation of substrates with acidic residues, similar to casein kinases, and can phosphorylate synthetic peptides derived from cellular proteins, indicating its role in cellular signaling pathways (Sorrell2020STK32A). The kinase's activity is not significantly affected by certain inhibitors, highlighting its robust kinase activity (Sorrell2020STK32A). Despite these insights, the specific mechanistic roles of STK32A in healthy human cells remain unclear, as there is no direct information on its cellular functions (Sorrell2020STK32A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the STK32A gene have been associated with several diseases and conditions. Genetic studies have linked polymorphisms in STK32A to coeliac disease, suggesting a potential role in autoimmune disorders (Sorrell2020STK32A). Additionally, a methylation site within the STK32A gene has been associated with smoking, indicating a possible interaction with environmental factors that could influence disease risk (Sorrell2020STK32A).

STK32A has also been implicated in cancer. The PPP2R2B-STK32A-DPYSL3 locus has been identified as a susceptibility locus for lung cancer, highlighting its potential role in cancer predisposition (Sorrell2020STK32A). In melanoma, driver mutations such as the S89F missense mutation have been identified in STK32A, suggesting its involvement in tumorigenesis (Sorrell2020STK32A). The gene is part of the STK32/YANK kinase family, which has been linked to various cancers, including stomach adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine carcinoma (Jia2023The).

Despite these associations, STK32A is considered a "dark kinase," with limited understanding of its substrates and signaling pathways, which complicates the full elucidation of its clinical significance (Jia2023The).

## Interactions
STK32A, a dual-specificity kinase, is involved in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It is part of a network involving miR-130a-5p and RUNX2 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). miR-130a-5p targets RUNX2, which in turn regulates STK32A expression. This interaction influences NSCLC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, with STK32A promoting NF-ÎºB phosphorylation, a process inhibited by miR-130a-5p (Ma2020The).

In the context of hair cell development in the mouse inner ear, STK32A interacts with the transmembrane receptor GPR156. STK32A regulates the apical localization of GPR156, affecting the planar cell polarity (PCP) of hair cells. This interaction is crucial for aligning the intrinsic polarity of stereociliary bundles with the PCP axis, although direct physical interactions or phosphorylation events between STK32A and GPR156 have not been demonstrated (Jia2023The).

STK32A also binds multiple kinase inhibitors, including broad-spectrum type-I inhibitors like Staurosporine and clinically-tested inhibitors such as Ceritinib and Dabrafenib. This binding is influenced by its small gatekeeper residue, allowing it to accommodate bulky groups in its ATP-binding site (Sorrell2020STK32A).
