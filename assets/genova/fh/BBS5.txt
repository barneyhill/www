# BBS5

## Overview
The BBS5 gene encodes the Bardet-Biedl syndrome 5 protein, a critical component of the BBSome complex, which is involved in ciliary function and intracellular trafficking. The BBS5 protein is characterized by its unique tandem pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, which distinguish it from other BBSome components and suggest a role in membrane interactions, although recent studies have questioned this function (Singh2019Structure; BentleyFord2021A). The BBSome complex, including BBS5, is essential for the regulation of protein composition in cilia, impacting processes such as photoreceptor function and organelle transport (Yen2006Bardet–Biedl; Bolch2016A). Mutations in BBS5 are associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome, a disorder characterized by a spectrum of clinical features, including retinal dystrophy and renal anomalies, due to its role in ciliary signaling and trafficking (Forsythe2012Bardet–Biedl; Niederlova2019Meta‐analysis).

## Structure
The BBS5 protein is a component of the BBSome complex, which is involved in ciliary function and membrane-protein trafficking. It consists of 341 amino acids and is encoded by 12 exons (Karam2023WGS). BBS5 contains two tandem pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, known as BBS5 N-PH and BBS5 C-PH, which are structurally similar despite having only 25% sequence identity. These domains are composed of two curved antiparallel beta-sheets forming a hydrophobic gorge capped by an amphiphilic alpha-helix (Singh2019Structure). The PH domains typically interact with phosphoinositides, but in BBS5, the binding pockets are not conserved and are occluded by elements from BBS9 (Singh2019Structure).

The tertiary structure of BBS5 is crucial for its role in the BBSome complex, which includes other subunits such as BBS1, BBS2, BBS4, BBS7, BBS8, BBS9, and BBS18 (Karam2023WGS). BBS5 is unique among BBSome components due to its PH domains, which are not found in other BBS proteins (Karam2023WGS). Post-translational modifications include phosphorylation at Ser19 and Ser246, which affects its interaction with other proteins (Yu2020Bbs5). The BBS5 protein's structure is essential for its function in ciliogenesis and the regulation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway (Karam2023WGS).

## Function
The BBS5 gene encodes a protein that is a component of the BBSome complex, which is crucial for the regulation of protein composition in cilia, including the photoreceptor outer segments in the retina. In healthy human cells, the BBSome, including BBS5, plays a significant role in vesicle trafficking from the Golgi to the base of the cilium through interaction with Rab8. It also acts as an adaptor molecule for cargo transport along the cilia via the intraflagellar transport pathway, essential for the development and maintenance of photoreceptor outer segments (Bolch2016A).

BBS5 is involved in intracellular trafficking, particularly in the retrograde transport of organelles such as melanosomes. This function is crucial for maintaining cilia and organelle trafficking, which are essential for various developmental and physiological processes (Yen2006Bardet–Biedl). BBS5 is also implicated in ciliary signaling, which is vital for sensory and signaling processes in cells. It is unique among BBSome components due to its predicted ability to mediate membrane interactions through its plextrin homology (PH) domains, although recent analyses suggest it may not interact with the membrane as previously thought (BentleyFord2021A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the BBS5 gene are associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a range of clinical features. These include retinal dystrophy, obesity, polydactyly, renal anomalies, and cognitive impairments. BBS5 is a component of the BBSome complex, which is crucial for ciliary function and intracellular trafficking. Disruptions in BBS5 can lead to defects in primary cilia, affecting various signaling pathways such as the sonic hedgehog and Wnt pathways, which are essential for normal cellular function and development (Forsythe2012Bardet–Biedl; Niederlova2019Meta‐analysis).

The clinical presentation of BBS due to BBS5 mutations can vary significantly, with some patients exhibiting more severe symptoms than others. This variability is partly due to the potential role of BBS5 as a modifier gene, influencing the severity and expressivity of the BBS phenotype. For instance, a heterozygous missense variant in BBS5 has been shown to modify the clinical presentation in individuals with biallelic variants in other BBS genes (PereaRomero2022Allelic).

BBS5 mutations are also implicated in renal anomalies, with studies indicating that patients with BBS5 mutations may exhibit a frequency of renal issues similar to those with mutations in other BBSome genes (Niederlova2019Meta‐analysis).

## Interactions
BBS5 is a component of the BBSome complex, which is involved in ciliary transport and protein trafficking. It interacts with several proteins, including arrestin1 (arr1) in photoreceptor cells. This interaction is modulated by light-dependent phosphorylation of BBS5, which reduces its binding to arr1 when phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC) (Smith2013Lightdependent). BBS5 and arr1 co-localize along the photoreceptor axoneme in the dark, facilitating the light-dependent translocation of arr1 (Smith2013Lightdependent).

BBS5 also interacts with Kinesin light chain 3 (KLC3) during mouse spermatogenesis. This interaction is regulated by the phosphorylation status of BBS5 at specific serine residues, particularly Ser 246, which when phosphorylated, blocks the interaction with KLC3 (Yu2020Bbs5). 

In the context of the BBSome, BBS5 interacts with other BBS proteins, such as BBS1, BBS2, BBS4, BBS7, BBS8, and BBS9, forming a stable complex essential for ciliary function (Zhang2012Intrinsic). BBS5 also interacts with NPHP5, a ciliopathy protein, indicating its role in ciliary trafficking and cargo delivery (Barbelanne2014Nephrocystin).
