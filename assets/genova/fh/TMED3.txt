# TMED3

## Overview
TMED3, or transmembrane p24 trafficking protein 3, is a gene that encodes a type I single-pass transmembrane protein belonging to the p24 protein family. This protein is integral to the secretory pathway, facilitating the transport of cargo proteins between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. TMED3 is characterized by its luminal Golgi-dynamics (GOLD) domain, which is essential for dimerization and interaction with other TMED proteins, and a transmembrane domain that aids in vesicle budding (Aber2019Transmembrane). The protein plays a significant role in cellular homeostasis, protein folding, and secretion, and is involved in various signaling pathways, including the WNT-TCF signaling pathway, which has implications in cancer metastasis (Mishra2019The). TMED3's interactions with other proteins, such as FOXO1a, FOXO3a, and CDCA8, further underscore its involvement in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target (WEI2024TMED3; Guo2023TMED3).

## Structure
TMED3, a member of the TMED family, is a type I single-pass transmembrane protein found in eukaryotes. It features a luminal Golgi-dynamics (GOLD) domain, a luminal coiled-coil domain, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytosolic tail (Aber2019Transmembrane). The GOLD domain is crucial for dimerization, facilitating interactions with other TMED proteins, while the transmembrane domain interacts with lipids to assist in vesicle budding (Aber2019Transmembrane). The cytoplasmic tail contains diphenylalanine (FF) and dilysine motifs (KK), which are important for binding to coatomer (COP) proteins, aiding in cargo selection and vesicle formation (Aber2019Transmembrane).

TMED3 is involved in the transport of various cargo proteins, including glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, transmembrane proteins, and secreted proteins like Notch and G-protein-coupled receptors (Aber2019Transmembrane). Although specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of TMED3 are not provided, the presence of these domains suggests a complex structure that supports its role in protein transport and cellular signaling. The protein may also undergo post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, and exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing.

## Function
TMED3, or transmembrane p24 trafficking protein 3, is a member of the p24 protein family involved in protein trafficking within the secretory pathway, specifically between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. In healthy human cells, TMED3 plays a crucial role in the selection and transport of cargo proteins within coat protein complex vesicles, which are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper protein folding and secretion (Wang2022Expression). TMED3 is associated with innate immune functionality and is involved in multiple secretion events and signaling pathways, impacting cellular communication and function (Wang2022Expression).

TMED3 proteins can exist as monomers or form dynamic complexes, which influence the stability of other proteins within the cell (Wang2022Expression). Although the specific functions of TMED3 in healthy cells are not extensively detailed, it is implied that TMED3 is involved in regulating normal signaling pathways, such as the WNT-TCF signaling pathway, which is known to be anti-metastatic in the context of cancer (Mishra2019The). This suggests that TMED3 may play a role in maintaining normal cellular signaling and preventing the transition to pro-metastatic states (Mishra2019The).

## Clinical Significance
TMED3 has been implicated in the progression and metastasis of various cancers. In osteosarcoma, TMED3 is overexpressed, correlating with increased tumor malignancy. Knockdown experiments have shown that reducing TMED3 expression inhibits cell proliferation and migration while enhancing apoptosis, suggesting its role in promoting osteosarcoma progression (Xu2021TMED3RPS15A). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TMED3 is upregulated and associated with aggressive cancer characteristics and poor prognosis. It promotes metastasis through the IL-11/STAT3 signaling pathway, and its high expression is linked to larger tumor size and vascular invasion (Zheng2016TMED3). 

TMED3 also plays a role in endometrial carcinoma, where its high expression is associated with lymphatic metastasis. Silencing TMED3 reduces cell viability and migration, indicating its function as a tumor promoter (Zhang2022Depleting). In lung squamous cell carcinoma, TMED3 is upregulated and contributes to higher tumor grades and shorter survival times (Xie2021TMED3). 

The gene's role varies by cancer type, acting as both an oncogene and a tumor suppressor, depending on the context (Aber2019Transmembrane). These findings suggest TMED3 as a potential therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
TMED3, or transmembrane p24 trafficking protein 3, is involved in several protein interactions that contribute to its role in cancer progression. In prostate cancer, TMED3 interacts with the FOXO signaling pathway by regulating the phosphorylation of FOXO1a and FOXO3a. This interaction is crucial as it suppresses prostate cancer progression by decreasing the phosphorylation of these FOXO proteins, which are known to play protective roles in cancer (WEI2024TMED3).

In malignant melanoma, TMED3 interacts with Cell Division Cycle Associated 8 (CDCA8) and regulates the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This interaction promotes melanoma progression by enhancing cell proliferation and migration while suppressing apoptosis. The interaction between TMED3 and CDCA8 is evidenced by co-immunoprecipitation experiments, which demonstrate that TMED3 regulates the PI3K/AKT pathway through CDCA8 (Guo2023TMED3).

In lung squamous cell carcinoma, TMED3 interacts with the protein EZR. This interaction is significant as it promotes tumor growth and progression. Knockdown of TMED3 results in reduced expression of EZR, indicating that EZR is a downstream target of TMED3 and plays a crucial role in mediating its effects on cancer progression (Xie2021TMED3).
