# EFCAB11

## Overview
EFCAB11 (EF-hand calcium binding domain 11) is a gene that encodes a protein characterized by the presence of EF-hand domains, which are known for their role in calcium ion binding. This protein is involved in calcium-dependent regulatory processes, playing a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. The EF-hand domains facilitate the protein's involvement in critical physiological functions such as muscle relaxation and neurotransmitter release, underscoring its importance in maintaining calcium homeostasis within cells (Kelemen2021New). The gene's potential regulatory influence on gene expression, through its association with significant SNPs near regulatory elements, further emphasizes its role in transcriptional regulation and cellular homeostasis (Dong2012Followup).

## Structure


## Function
EFCAB11 (EF-hand calcium binding domain 11) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in calcium ion binding, a critical process in cellular signaling. The protein contains EF-hand domains, which are helix-loop-helix structural motifs that bind calcium ions. These domains are typically involved in calcium-dependent regulatory processes, influencing various cellular activities such as muscle relaxation and neurotransmitter release (Kelemen2021New). 

In healthy human cells, EFCAB11 is likely involved in muscle relaxation through its calcium-binding activity, as suggested by its association with EF-hand domains (Dong2012Followup). The protein's role in calcium homeostasis is crucial for maintaining normal physiological functions, as calcium ions act as second messengers in numerous cellular processes, including synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability (Kelemen2021New). 

EFCAB11 is also implicated in the regulation of gene expression, as evidenced by its association with significant SNPs near regulatory elements, suggesting a potential role in transcriptional regulation of nearby genes (Dong2012Followup). The gene's involvement in these molecular processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis.
