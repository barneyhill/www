# DHTKD1

## Overview
The DHTKD1 gene encodes the mitochondrial protein dehydrogenase E1 and transketolase domain containing 1, which is integral to energy metabolism and mitochondrial function. This protein is a component of the 2-oxoadipate dehydrogenase complex, playing a pivotal role in the catabolic pathways of amino acids such as lysine, tryptophan, and hydroxylysine. It facilitates the conversion of 2-oxoadipate to glutaryl-CoA, a critical step in the breakdown of 2-aminoadipic acid into acetyl-CoA, which subsequently enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle for energy production (Wang2021KnockOut; Hagen2015Genetic). The DHTKD1 protein is characterized by its mitochondrial localization and its structural homology to other E1 enzymes, although it possesses unique features that enhance its catalytic efficiency with specific substrates (Bezerra2020Crystal). Mutations in the DHTKD1 gene have been linked to various human disorders, including Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2Q and 2-aminoadipic and 2-oxoadipic aciduria, highlighting its clinical significance (Luan2020CMT2Q-causing; Hagen2015Genetic).

## Structure
The DHTKD1 protein is a 919-amino acid polypeptide with a mitochondrial targeting signal peptide at the N-terminal. Its structure includes an N-terminal helical bundle followed by three alpha/beta domains, interconnected by an extended linker threading along the protein surface (Bezerra2020Crystal). The protein forms an intertwined obligate homodimer, similar to the OGDH structure, with the asymmetric unit containing two DHTKD1 protomers arranged as a homodimer (Bezerra2020Crystal). The crystal structure of DHTKD1 was determined at 1.9 Å resolution, revealing a substrate binding pocket lined by residues from both subunits of the homodimer. The active site binds thiamine diphosphate (ThDP) and Mg2+, with a V-shaped conformation essential for catalysis (Bezerra2020Crystal).

DHTKD1 is structurally homologous to msOGDH and ecOGDH, but lacks the allosteric activator binding sites found in these homologues due to low sequence conservation. Unique surface insertions and helical bundles distinguish DHTKD1 from other E1 enzymes like PDH and BCKDH (Bezerra2020Crystal). The protein's active site is adapted for higher catalytic efficiency with 2-oxoadipate compared to 2-oxoglutarate, with specific amino acids poised for substrate interaction (Bezerra2020Crystal). The study did not mention specific post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms (Bezerra2020Crystal).

## Function
The DHTKD1 gene encodes a mitochondrial protein that plays a crucial role in energy metabolism and mitochondrial function. It is a key component of the 2-oxoadipate dehydrogenase complex, which is involved in the catabolic pathway of amino acids such as lysine, tryptophan, and hydroxylysine. This complex facilitates the conversion of 2-oxoadipate to glutaryl-CoA, a process essential for the breakdown of 2-aminoadipic acid (2-AAA) into acetyl-CoA, which then enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle for energy production (Wang2021KnockOut; Hagen2015Genetic).

In healthy human cells, DHTKD1 is critical for maintaining mitochondrial respiration and energy metabolism. It supports mitochondrial biogenesis and function, correlating with ATP production. Knockout studies have shown that the absence of DHTKD1 leads to decreased mitochondrial respiration, reduced expression of electron transport chain proteins, and altered mitochondrial morphology, although glycolytic function remains unaffected (Wang2021KnockOut). DHTKD1 also interacts with other proteins to form a hybrid ketoacid dehydrogenase complex, indicating its involvement in broader metabolic pathways (Leandro2019DHTKD1). Its activity is primarily localized in the mitochondria, where it contributes to maintaining metabolic homeostasis (Artiukhov2020Synthetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DHTKD1 gene are associated with several human disorders, including Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2Q (CMT2Q), 2-aminoadipic and 2-oxoadipic aciduria (AMOXAD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). CMT2Q is characterized by distal muscle weakness and atrophy, often with sensory defects and abnormal myelination, linked to mutations such as the Y486* mutation in DHTKD1 (CastroCoyotl2021Atypical; Luan2020CMT2Q-causing). AMOXAD is a metabolic disorder resulting from defects in lysine and tryptophan catabolism, leading to increased excretion of alpha-ketoadipic and alpha-aminoadipic acids. This condition is linked to various mutations in DHTKD1, including missense and nonsense mutations that affect protein expression and function (Hagen2015Genetic).

DHTKD1 variants have also been implicated in ALS, where they may increase disease risk and modify its phenotype. Patients with these variants often exhibit sensory impairment and sensorimotor neuropathy, suggesting a phenotypic overlap with other motor neuron disorders (Osmanovic2021Heterozygous). Alterations in DHTKD1 expression can lead to impaired mitochondrial function, contributing to metabolic diseases such as Type 2 Diabetes and Coronary Artery Disease (Wang2021KnockOut).

## Interactions
DHTKD1 interacts with several proteins to form multiprotein complexes crucial for mitochondrial metabolism. It is a component of the 2-oxoadipate dehydrogenase complex (OADHc), where it interacts with DLST (dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase) and DLD (dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase) to catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of 2-oxoadipate in mitochondria (Bezerra2020Crystal). DHTKD1 forms a complex with DLST, an E2 component, which is essential for its function within the OADHc complex. This interaction is critical for the stability and function of the complex, and mutations in DHTKD1 can disrupt this interaction, affecting complex formation (Bezerra2020Crystal).

DHTKD1 also interacts with OGDH (oxoglutarate dehydrogenase) to form a hybrid complex that includes both α-ketoglutaric and α-ketoadipic acid dehydrogenase activities. This hybrid complex suggests a shared substrate specificity between DHTKD1 and OGDH, allowing for potential crosstalk between the OADHc and OGDHc complexes (Leandro2019DHTKD1). Immunoprecipitation experiments have confirmed that DHTKD1 can be co-immunoprecipitated with OGDH, DLST, and DLD, indicating these proteins interact to form a complex (Leandro2019DHTKD1). These interactions are significant for understanding the metabolic pathways involved and have potential therapeutic implications for conditions like glutaric aciduria type 1 (GA1) (Leandro2019DHTKD1).
