# TRAPPC1

## Overview
TRAPPC1 is a gene that encodes the trafficking protein particle complex subunit 1, a critical component of the TRAPP (trafficking protein particle) complex. This protein is integral to the core structure of the TRAPP I complex, which is involved in the early stages of the secretory pathway, particularly in ER-to-Golgi transport (Brunet2014In; Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:). As a part of the TRAPP complexes, TRAPPC1 functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for small GTPases, facilitating nucleotide exchange and contributing to vesicle transport (Brunet2014In). The protein is homologous to the yeast Bet5 protein and plays a vital role in maintaining proper cellular trafficking, impacting processes such as protein sorting and membrane dynamics (Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:). Its interactions with other TRAPP subunits and involvement in the activation of Rab GTPases underscore its significance in cellular trafficking and potential implications in disease contexts, such as Parkinson's Disease (Brunet2014In).

## Function
TRAPPC1 is a component of the TRAPP (trafficking protein particle) complex, which plays a crucial role in vesicle-mediated transport within cells. It is part of the core structure of the TRAPP I complex, which is involved in the early stages of the secretory pathway, particularly in ER-to-Golgi transport (Brunet2014In; Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:). TRAPPC1, the human equivalent of the yeast Bet5 protein, is essential for maintaining proper cellular trafficking, impacting processes like protein sorting and membrane dynamics (Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:).

The TRAPP complexes, including TRAPP I, II, and III, are involved in multiple trafficking steps such as the early secretory pathway, endocytosis, and autophagy. TRAPP I forms a stable core that is shared by TRAPP II and III, with additional subunits dictating their specific roles (Brunet2014In). TRAPPC1's involvement in these complexes suggests its participation in the regulation of intracellular trafficking processes, although its specific function in healthy human cells is not directly detailed in the available literature (Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:). The TRAPP complexes also act as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for small GTPases, facilitating nucleotide exchange and contributing to vesicle transport (Brunet2014In).

## Interactions
TRAPPC1 is a component of the TRAPP (trafficking protein particle) complex, which plays a crucial role in vesicle-mediated transport. It is the human equivalent of the yeast Bet5 protein and is part of the core set of proteins shared by the TRAPP I, II, and III complexes (Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:). TRAPPC1 interacts with other TRAPP subunits, such as TRAPPC6A1 and TRAPPC6B, to form heterotrimeric complexes. These interactions suggest that TRAPPC1 is involved in forming isocomplexes with these subunits, although specific interactions with other proteins are not detailed (Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:).

TRAPPC1 is also associated with the activation of Rab GTPases, particularly Rab1, through its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity. This interaction is crucial for the vesicle docking and fusion processes, as Rab1 is involved in suppressing trafficking defects induced by proteins like α-synuclein, which is linked to Parkinson's Disease (Brunet2014In). The potential interaction between TRAPP III and Rab1a in the context of Parkinson's Disease is suggested but has not been experimentally tested (Brunet2014In). These interactions highlight the role of TRAPPC1 in cellular trafficking and its potential implications in disease contexts.
