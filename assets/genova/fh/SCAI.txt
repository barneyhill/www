# SCAI

## Overview
The SCAI gene encodes the suppressor of cancer cell invasion protein, which functions primarily as a transcriptional co-repressor involved in regulating cell motility and invasion. This protein plays a critical role in maintaining cellular integrity by modulating gene expression related to cytoskeletal dynamics and cell adhesion, thereby preventing uncontrolled cell movement and cancer metastasis (Gasparics2017Alterations). SCAI is active in the nucleus, where it interacts with other proteins to inhibit the expression of genes that promote cell migration and is involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by repressing the MKL-SRF complex (Gasparics2017Alterations). Additionally, SCAI is implicated in DNA repair processes, particularly in response to UV-induced replicative stress, by modulating the activity of nucleases like EXO1 (Lemay2022A). The protein's interactions with various DNA repair proteins underscore its role in maintaining genomic stability and modulating cellular responses to DNA damage (Lemay2022A).

## Function
The SCAI (suppressor of cancer cell invasion) gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in regulating cell motility and invasion, primarily functioning as a transcriptional co-repressor. In healthy human cells, SCAI is involved in modulating gene expression related to cytoskeletal dynamics and cell adhesion, which are crucial for maintaining normal cell adhesion and preventing uncontrolled cell movement. This function is essential for tissue integrity and preventing cancer metastasis (Gasparics2017Alterations).

SCAI is active in the nucleus, where it interacts with other proteins to inhibit the expression of genes that promote cell migration. It regulates the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by repressing the MKL-SRF complex, thereby inhibiting CArG-dependent gene expression and regulating the expression of several EMT markers and regulators (Gasparics2017Alterations). SCAI also plays a role in DNA repair processes, particularly in response to UV-induced replicative stress. It is involved in managing DNA replication stress and protecting against DNA damage by modulating the activity of nucleases like EXO1, which are responsible for ssDNA formation and DNA replication defects (Lemay2022A).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SCAI gene have significant clinical implications in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In breast and lung cancers, high SCAI expression is associated with better survival outcomes, whereas in gastric, prostate, and colorectal cancers, elevated SCAI levels correlate with poorer survival (Gasparics2017Alterations). In breast cancer, SCAI expression is lower in tumor tissues compared to healthy tissues, suggesting a potential role in tumor suppression (Gasparics2017Alterations). Conversely, in colorectal cancer, SCAI is overexpressed, regardless of disease stage or metastatic status (Gasparics2017Alterations).

In cervical cancer, the regulation of SCAI by microRNA-766-5p is crucial, as inhibition of this microRNA can attenuate cancer progression by modulating SCAI expression (Cai2020Inhibition). Similarly, in papillary thyroid cancer, microRNA-1270 targets SCAI, leading to its downregulation and promoting cancer cell proliferation and migration (Yi2019MicroRNA1270). In oral squamous cell carcinoma, miR-5100 upregulation results in decreased SCAI expression, enhancing cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Wei2019Mir5100). These findings highlight the potential of SCAI as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in various cancers.

## Interactions
SCAI (suppressor of cancer cell invasion) is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in the DNA damage response and replicative stress. SCAI interacts with the REV3L subunit of the TLS polymerase zeta, which is involved in DNA repair, particularly in the context of UV-induced replicative stress (Lemay2022A). It also binds to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) with greater affinity than double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and colocalizes with RPA during double-strand break repair, suggesting a role in modulating ssDNA gaps and inhibiting EXO1-mediated DNA resection (Lemay2022A).

SCAI is recruited to chromatin in response to UV-induced stress, where it interacts with proteins involved in DNA repair and replicative stress responses, such as BRCA2, PLK1, SLX4, and CLASPIN (Lemay2022A). It also interacts with 53BP1, although this interaction is not relevant in the context of UV-induced RPA-ssDNA accumulation (Lemay2022A). SCAI's interaction with 53BP1 is crucial for facilitating homology-directed repair by making DNA breakage sites accessible to HDR-associated proteins (Anuchina2023Bridging). These interactions highlight SCAI's role in maintaining genomic stability and modulating the cellular response to DNA damage.
