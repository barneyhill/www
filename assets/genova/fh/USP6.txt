# USP6

## Overview
USP6, or ubiquitin specific peptidase 6, is a gene that encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme involved in various cellular processes, including protein turnover and intracellular trafficking. The protein product of USP6 is characterized by its dual-domain structure, comprising a TBC (Tre2/Bub2/Cdc16) domain and a USP (ubiquitin-specific protease) domain, which confer its Rab GTPase-activating and deubiquitinating activities, respectively (Daviet2008Targeting). USP6 is a chimeric gene resulting from the fusion of TBC1D3 and USP32, and it exists in multiple splice variant isoforms that contribute to its diverse functional roles (Oliveira2004USP6). The enzyme plays a significant role in modulating signaling pathways such as Wnt and NMDA receptor pathways, impacting cellular processes like synaptic plasticity, cell proliferation, and differentiation (Madan2016USP6; Zeng2019The). Clinically, USP6 is implicated in several neoplastic disorders, including aneurysmal bone cysts and nodular fasciitis, where chromosomal translocations lead to its overexpression and subsequent tumorigenesis (Oliveira2005Aneurysmal; Lenz2019Novel).

## Structure
The USP6 gene encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme that is involved in various cellular processes, including intracellular trafficking and protein turnover. The molecular structure of USP6 includes several distinct domains. It contains a TBC (Tre2/Bub2/Cdc16) domain at its N-terminus, which is involved in Rab GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity, and a USP domain at its C-terminus, responsible for its deubiquitinating activity (Daviet2008Targeting). USP6 is a chimeric gene derived from the fusion of TBC1D3 and USP32, with the first 14 exons originating from TBC1D3 and exons 15-30 from USP32 (Oliveira2004USP6).

USP6 has several splice variant isoforms, including Tre17(long), which contains both the TBC and USP domains, Tre17(onco), which lacks the His Box in the USP domain essential for deubiquitinating activity, and Tre17(short), which contains only the RabGAP-TBC domain (Daviet2008Targeting). Post-translational modifications, such as mono-ubiquitination and de-ubiquitination, potentially regulate its function, although the exact mechanisms and consequences are not fully understood (Daviet2008Targeting). These structural features contribute to USP6's role in cellular transformation and its involvement in various cancers and bone lesions.

## Function
USP6 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 6) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a crucial role in regulating protein stability and function in healthy human cells. It is involved in the modulation of NMDA receptor (NMDAR) stability, which is essential for synaptic plasticity and cognitive processes. USP6 stabilizes NMDARs by reducing their ubiquitination, thereby enhancing their expression and cell surface distribution. This activity is critical for synaptic transmission and plasticity, which are fundamental to learning and memory (Zeng2019The).

USP6 also influences Wnt signaling pathways by deubiquitylating components such as Frizzled receptors, leading to increased β-catenin levels. This regulation enhances Wnt signaling, which is important for various cellular processes, including cell proliferation and differentiation (Madan2016USP6). USP6's activity in the cytoplasm and nucleus affects cellular homeostasis and organismal development by modulating the stability and activity of key signaling proteins (Madan2016USP6).

In addition to its role in synaptic and signaling pathways, USP6 is implicated in the regulation of c-Jun protein stability, influencing transcriptional activity and cellular processes such as migration and invasion (Li2018UbiquitinSpecific). These functions highlight USP6's significant role in maintaining cellular and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the USP6 gene are implicated in several neoplastic disorders, primarily due to chromosomal translocations that lead to its overexpression. Aneurysmal bone cysts (ABCs) are one of the primary conditions associated with USP6 rearrangements. In these cysts, USP6 is often fused with promoters of highly expressed genes, such as CDH11, leading to its upregulation and contributing to osteoblastic tumorigenesis through pathways like NF-kappa-B activation (Oliveira2005Aneurysmal; Warren2017Gene).

Nodular fasciitis is another condition linked to USP6 translocations, where the gene is frequently fused with MYH9, among others. This results in the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for the development of these tumors (Madan2016USP6; Lenz2019Novel). Despite their neoplastic nature, these tumors are generally benign and self-limiting (NAKAYAMA2021Ubiquitinspecific).

USP6 rearrangements are also found in other fibroblastic and myofibroblastic tumors, such as cellular fibroma of the tendon sheath and myositis ossificans. These rearrangements often involve novel fusion partners, indicating a complex molecular landscape that contributes to tumorigenesis (Zhang2023USP6associated; NAKAYAMA2021Ubiquitinspecific).

## Interactions
USP6 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 6) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with the small GTPase Arf6 through its TBC domain, promoting plasma membrane localization and regulating Arf6-dependent endocytic membrane trafficking (Blackburn2019RNA). USP6 also exhibits deubiquitylase activity through its USP domain, which is crucial for its role in protein stability and cell signaling (legrand2023histopathogenesis).

USP6 can activate the β-catenin-dependent Wnt signaling pathway by inhibiting the degradation of the Frizzleds receptor, which is important for cell growth and differentiation (legrand2023histopathogenesis). It also stabilizes Jak1, leading to the activation of the STAT3 pathway, which is involved in cell proliferation and cancer progression (Lenz2019Novel). USP6 can independently activate STAT3 and NF-κB, with NF-κB playing a role in inflammation and cellular transformation (legrand2023histopathogenesis).

In the context of bone and soft-tissue tumors, USP6 rearrangements lead to its overexpression, which can activate various signaling pathways crucial for tumorigenesis (legrand2023histopathogenesis). These interactions highlight USP6's role in tumorigenesis and its potential as a therapeutic target.
