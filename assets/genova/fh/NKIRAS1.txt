# NKIRAS1

## Overview
NKIRAS1 (NFKB inhibitor interacting Ras-like 1) is a gene that encodes a member of the Ras protein superfamily, which plays a critical role in the regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. The protein encoded by NKIRAS1 functions as a modulator by interacting with IκB proteins, thereby inhibiting the activation of NF-κB, a transcription factor involved in immune response, inflammation, and cell survival. This interaction is essential for maintaining NF-κB in an inactive state within the cytosol, thus preventing excessive immune responses and contributing to cellular homeostasis (Sarais2020Characterisation). NKIRAS1 is also implicated in the regulation of the AP-1/NF-κB pathway, particularly in immune responses at the maternal-fetal interface (Xue2013miR155*). Clinically, NKIRAS1 has been associated with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where its upregulation is linked to oncogenic functions, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention (Braga2015Upregulation).

## Function
NKIRAS1 (NFKB inhibitor interacting Ras-like 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is crucial for immune response, inflammation, and cell survival. The NKIRAS1 protein acts as a modulator by inhibiting the activation of NF-κB through its interaction with IκB proteins. This interaction prevents the degradation of the inhibitory complex, thereby keeping NF-κB inactive in the cytosol (Sarais2020Characterisation).

In healthy human cells, NKIRAS1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it influences cellular responses to stress and inflammation, contributing to maintaining cellular homeostasis and immune function. The protein's ability to restrain NF-κB activity suggests its role in dampening immune responses, which is essential for preventing excessive immune reactions and maintaining immune homeostasis (Sarais2020Characterisation).

NKIRAS1 is also involved in the regulation of the AP-1/NF-κB pathway, acting as an intracellular negative regulator that helps maintain the balance of TLR4 signaling. This regulation is crucial for appropriate immune responses, particularly at the maternal-fetal interface, where disorders in TLR4 signaling can lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes (Xue2013miR155*).

## Clinical Significance
The NKIRAS1 gene is implicated in the pathogenesis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) through its altered expression levels. Studies have shown that the upregulation of NKIRAS1 in lung tumors is associated with the demethylation of its promoter regions and gene amplification, leading to increased mRNA expression in a significant number of tumor samples compared to normal lung tissue (Braga2015Upregulation). This upregulation is linked to oncogenic functions in NSCLC, suggesting that NKIRAS1 may play a role in tumor development and progression (Braga2015Upregulation).

The expression of NKIRAS1 is also influenced by the methylation status of regulatory miRNA genes. Methylation of these miRNA genes, which are predicted to regulate NKIRAS1, correlates with changes in NKIRAS1 mRNA levels. This suggests that miRNA methylation may inhibit the suppression of NKIRAS1, contributing to its elevated expression in tumors (Braga2015Upregulation). The study highlights the potential of NKIRAS1 as a novel target gene for miRNAs susceptible to methylation in NSCLC, indicating a complex regulatory network involving genetic and epigenetic factors in the disease (Braga2015Upregulation).

## Interactions
NKIRAS1, a member of the Ras protein hyperfamily, is involved in regulating the NF-κB signaling pathway through its interactions with various proteins. It interacts with the PEST domains of IκB proteins, such as IκBα, to prevent their degradation. This interaction is crucial for maintaining NF-κB in an inactive form in the cytosol, thereby modulating NF-κB activity and influencing immune responses (Sarais2020Characterisation). NKIRAS1 is also associated with the p65 subunit of NF-κB, found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, which suggests a role in restraining NF-κB p65 in the cytoplasm and preventing its nuclear translocation (Sarais2020Characterisation). 

The activation of NKIRAS1 involves the binding of GTP and Mg2+, leading to conformational changes that facilitate the recruitment of downstream effector proteins. This mechanism highlights its role in cell-signal-transduction networks (Sarais2020Characterisation). In the context of cancer, NKIRAS1 has been noted for its elevated transcriptional activity in lung tumors, suggesting an oncogenic function. However, specific protein interactions in this context are not detailed (Braga2015Upregulation).
