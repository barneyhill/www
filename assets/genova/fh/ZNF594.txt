# ZNF594

## Overview
ZNF594 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 594, which is part of the zinc finger protein family known for their role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which facilitate interactions with DNA, RNA, or other proteins, thereby influencing gene expression and cellular processes. The ZNF594 protein is implicated in various biological functions and has been studied in the context of evolutionary biology, where it has been identified as a gene under positive selection (Jovanovic2021Positive). Although its specific functions and mechanisms are not fully understood, alterations in ZNF594 have been associated with certain diseases, including colorectal cancer, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Timofeeva2015Recurrent). Further research is needed to elucidate the precise roles and regulatory mechanisms of ZNF594 in health and disease.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF594 has been implicated in various diseases due to mutations and alterations in its expression. In the context of colorectal cancer (CRC), truncating variants in ZNF594 have been identified in multiple CRC cases, suggesting a potential role in the disease. These variants were absent in control populations, indicating a possible association with increased CRC risk (Timofeeva2015Recurrent). However, the specific clinical significance of these variants in CRC remains to be fully elucidated.

In a study focused on cerebellar hypoplasia and quadrupedal locomotion, a missense variant in ZNF594, p.L639F, was identified but later excluded as a causal mutation for the disorder. The variant was predicted to be benign and was found to be non-pathogenic due to its lack of conservation across species and presence of polymorphic nonsense mutations in control populations (Gulsuner2011Homozygosity).

Additionally, ZNF594 has been identified as a gene under positive selection in evolutionary studies, although the clinical implications of this finding are not detailed (Jovanovic2021Positive). Overall, while ZNF594 is associated with certain genetic variations in disease contexts, its precise role and clinical significance require further investigation.
