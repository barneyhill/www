# CTDSP1

## Overview
CTDSP1, or C-terminal domain small phosphatase 1, is a gene that encodes a nuclear phosphatase protein involved in the regulation of transcription and various cellular processes. The protein, also referred to as SCP1, is characterized by its phosphatase activity, specifically targeting the serine 5 residue of the heptad repeat in the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, which is crucial for transcriptional regulation and mRNA synthesis (Matsuoka2020CTDSP1). Beyond its role in transcription, CTDSP1 is involved in neuronal gene expression regulation, axonal regeneration, and growth factor modulation, highlighting its importance in both neural and peripheral tissues (Nesti2014Cterminal; Gervasi2021Cterminal). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as the REST/NRSF complex and AKT, further underscore its multifaceted role in cellular signaling and gene expression (Liao2017Palmitoylated; Yeo2005Small). CTDSP1's involvement in cancer biology, where it can act as both a tumor suppressor and a pro-oncogenic factor depending on the context, makes it a significant focus of research in oncology (Krasnov2023Tumor).

## Structure
CTDSP1 encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the dephosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. The protein is characterized by the presence of a phosphatase domain, which is essential for its enzymatic activity. This domain is likely to include structural elements such as alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's secondary structure. The tertiary structure of CTDSP1 involves the overall three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is crucial for its function and interaction with other molecules.

Post-translational modifications can significantly influence the function and localization of the CTDSP1 protein. These modifications may include phosphorylation, which can alter the protein's activity or its interaction with other cellular components. Additionally, splice variants of CTDSP1 may exist, potentially leading to isoforms with different functional properties or localization patterns within the cell. These variations can impact the protein's role in cellular processes and its regulatory mechanisms. The structural and functional diversity of CTDSP1 highlights its importance in cellular regulation and the complexity of its interactions within the cell.

## Function
CTDSP1, or C-terminal domain small phosphatase 1, is a nuclear phosphatase involved in the regulation of transcription in healthy human cells. It plays a critical role in dephosphorylating the serine 5 residue of the heptad repeat in the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II, which is essential for controlling transcriptional activity and mRNA synthesis (Matsuoka2020CTDSP1). This dephosphorylation is part of a dynamic process regulated by a balance of kinase and phosphatase activities, with CTDSP1 being a key phosphatase in this mechanism (Matsuoka2020CTDSP1).

CTDSP1 is also involved in the regulation of neuronal gene expression by stabilizing the repressor element 1-silencing transcription factor (REST) complex. This stabilization is crucial for silencing neuronal genes in non-neuronal cells and neural progenitors, thereby influencing neuronal differentiation (Nesti2014Cterminal). Additionally, CTDSP1 is implicated in the regulation of growth factor expression and axonal regeneration, particularly in peripheral nerve tissues. It modulates the expression of neurotrophic factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF), which are important for nerve repair and regeneration (Gervasi2021Cterminal).

## Clinical Significance
CTDSP1, also known as SCP1, plays a significant role in various cancers due to its involvement in dephosphorylating key proteins. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), CTDSP1 acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Its downregulation is associated with high-grade tumors and poorer survival outcomes in ccRCC patients (Krasnov2023Tumor). CTDSP1 also dephosphorylates the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), inhibiting the mTOR/HIF pathway, which contributes to its tumor-suppressive activity (Krasnov2023Tumor).

In other cancers, CTDSP1 exhibits dual roles. It has tumor-suppressive properties in breast cancer, liver carcinoma, osteosarcoma, and uveal melanoma by inhibiting cancer cell migration and invasion (Krasnov2023Tumor). However, in gastric cancer and neuroglioma, CTDSP1 stabilizes the SNAI1 transcription factor, promoting cancer cell migration, indicating a pro-oncogenic role in these contexts (Krasnov2023Tumor).

CTDSP1 also negatively regulates angiogenesis by dephosphorylating AKT at serine 473, a process crucial for suppressing tumorigenesis. Alterations in CTDSP1, such as changes in its palmitoylation status, can impact its ability to regulate AKT signaling, potentially influencing cancer progression (Liao2017Palmitoylated). SCP1 deficiency leads to enhanced angiogenesis and tumor growth, suggesting its potential as a target for cancer therapy (Liao2017Palmitoylated).

## Interactions
CTDSP1, also known as SCP1, is involved in several protein interactions that play a crucial role in its function as a phosphatase. It is a component of the REST/NRSF complex, which represses neuronal gene transcription in non-neuronal cells. CTDSP1 interacts with REST/NRSF, forming a complex that recruits it to RE-1 elements in neuronal genes, leading to gene silencing (Yeo2005Small). This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, demonstrating a physical association between CTDSP1 and REST/NRSF (Yeo2005Small).

CTDSP1 also interacts with RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), where it dephosphorylates the C-terminal domain, specifically targeting serine 5 residues. This interaction is crucial for modulating gene expression and is supported by co-immunoprecipitation studies showing the association of CTDSP1 with RNAPII (Yeo2003A).

Additionally, CTDSP1 interacts with AKT, a protein kinase, at the plasma membrane. This interaction is facilitated by the palmitoylation of CTDSP1, which is necessary for its localization and function in dephosphorylating AKT at Ser473, impacting angiogenesis and tumor growth (Liao2017Palmitoylated).
