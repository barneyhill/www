# STAP2

## Overview
STAP2, or signal transducing adaptor family member 2, is a gene that encodes an adaptor protein involved in various cellular signaling pathways. The STAP2 protein is characterized by the presence of a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and a Src homology 2 (SH2)-like domain, which facilitate its interactions with multiple signaling molecules, including Cbl, STAT3, and STAT5 (Sekine2009The; Ikeda2009STAP2). These interactions enable STAP2 to play a crucial role in modulating transcriptional activities and influencing pathways such as TLR4-mediated cytokine production and NF-κB activation (Sekine2009The). Additionally, STAP2 is involved in the regulation of immune responses and has been implicated in various diseases, including autoimmune disorders and cancer, due to its role in cell growth, differentiation, and immune cell trafficking (Kashiwakura2022The; Matsuda2021STAP2). The protein's function and stability are regulated by post-translational modifications and interactions with other proteins, highlighting its significance as a versatile adaptor in cellular signaling (Sekine2009The; Ikeda2009STAP2).

## Structure
STAP2, or signal transducing adaptor family member 2, is a protein characterized by several structural domains that facilitate its role in signal transduction. It contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and a Src homology 2 (SH2)-like domain, which are crucial for its interactions with other signaling molecules (Sekine2009The; Ikeda2009STAP2). These domains enable STAP2 to bind to proteins such as Cbl, STAT3, and STAT5, influencing various signaling pathways (Sekine2009The; Ikeda2009STAP2).

The C-terminal region of STAP2 includes a YXXQ motif, which is important for its interaction with STAT3 (Ikeda2009STAP2). STAP2 also possesses a proline-rich region that contributes to its binding with other proteins like PLC-g1 (Sekine2009The). A significant post-translational modification of STAP2 is the phosphorylation at tyrosine-250 (Tyr250) by the kinase Brk, which is essential for Brk-mediated STAT3 activation (Ikeda2009STAP2).

STAP2 can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may affect its function and localization, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context (Ikeda2009STAP2). The molecular structure of STAP2, particularly its PH and SH2-like domains, is integral to its function and regulation by proteins like Cbl (Sekine2009The).

## Function
STAP-2 (signal transducing adaptor family member 2) is an adaptor protein involved in various cellular signaling pathways in healthy human cells. It contains pleckstrin and Src homology 2 (SH2)-like domains, as well as a YXXQ motif, which facilitate its interactions with multiple signaling molecules (Sekine2009The; Ikeda2009STAP2). STAP-2 interacts with STAT3 and STAT5, modulating their transcriptional activities, and plays a role in TLR4-mediated cytokine production and NF-kB activation through interactions with MyD88 and IKK-a/b (Sekine2009The). 

The protein is also involved in the regulation of FceRI-mediated signals by binding to PLC-g1, which requires its SH2-like domain and C-terminal proline-rich region (Sekine2009The). STAP-2 is phosphorylated at tyrosine-250 by the kinase Brk, which is crucial for Brk-mediated STAT3 activation, indicating its role in cell growth and differentiation (Ikeda2009STAP2). 

STAP-2 protein levels are regulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl, which mediates its degradation through ubiquitination and proteasomal pathways, affecting its stability and function in cellular signaling (Sekine2009The). This regulation is important for modulating immune and inflammatory responses in healthy cells (Sekine2009The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the STAP2 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in immune disorders and cancer. In the context of immune responses, dysregulation of STAP2 can lead to autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjögren's syndrome. This is due to its role in T cell activation and apoptosis, where STAP2 deficiency results in increased cell adhesion and altered immune cell trafficking, potentially leading to immune-related conditions (Kashiwakura2022The; Matsuda2021STAP2).

In cancer, STAP2 is involved in the progression of several types, including breast cancer, melanoma, and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In breast cancer, STAP2 enhances the activation of STAT3, a critical factor for tumor growth, by acting as a scaffold protein for BRK and STAT3 interactions (Matsuda2021Possible; Laudisi2018STAT3). In CML, STAP2 interacts with the BCR-ABL oncoprotein, promoting disease progression and resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Matsuda2021Possible). In melanoma, STAP2 influences tumor invasion and metastasis by regulating chemokine receptor expression and protecting tyrosinase from degradation (Matsuda2021Possible). These roles highlight STAP2 as a potential therapeutic target in both immune and cancer-related diseases.

## Interactions
STAP2 (signal transducing adaptor family member 2) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. It acts as a substrate for the BRK (Breast Tumor Kinase) and interacts with STAT3 and STAT5, enhancing their transcriptional activity. This interaction is facilitated through the YXXQ motif in STAP2, which is crucial for STAT3 activation (Ikeda2011Interactions; Ikeda2009STAP2). STAP2 also interacts with MyD88 and IKK-α/β in macrophages, forming a complex that enhances NF-κB activity in response to TLR4 signaling (Matsuda2021STAP2; Ikeda2011Interactions).

In T cells, STAP2 regulates integrin-mediated adhesion and chemokine-induced migration by interacting with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and the E3-ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl, promoting FAK degradation (Matsuda2021STAP2; Sekine2014Adaptor). STAP2 also binds to Vav1 and Rac1, influencing T-cell migration (Sekine2014Adaptor). In the context of Epstein-Barr virus infection, STAP2 interacts with latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), negatively regulating LMP1-induced NF-κB activation through interactions with TRAF3 and TRADD (Ikeda2011Interactions). These interactions highlight STAP2's role as a versatile adaptor protein in various signaling pathways.
