# GPM6B

## Overview
GPM6B is a gene that encodes the glycoprotein M6B, a member of the proteolipid protein family, which is characterized by its four transmembrane domains. This protein is involved in a variety of cellular processes, particularly in the nervous system, where it plays a crucial role in neuronal differentiation, myelination, and neurotransmission. Glycoprotein M6B is expressed in neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes, and it interacts with several signaling pathways and proteins, such as the TGF-β-Smad2/3 pathway and the serotonin transporter, to mediate its effects (Zhang2018Glycoprotein; Dere2015Gpm6b). Beyond the nervous system, GPM6B is also significant in smooth muscle and bone differentiation, where it influences cellular processes like cytoskeleton organization and matrix vesicle release (Drabek2011GPM6B). The gene's expression and function have been linked to various clinical conditions, including neuropsychiatric disorders, cancer, and Parkinson's disease, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Le2021Common; Chung2023Whole; Wu2022LncRNA).

## Structure
GPM6B, or glycoprotein M6B, is a member of the proteolipid protein family, characterized by its involvement in various cellular processes, including neuronal development. The primary structure of GPM6B consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the GPM6B gene. This sequence forms the basis for its secondary structure, which likely includes transmembrane helices, a common feature of membrane proteins. These helices contribute to the protein's ability to span cellular membranes, facilitating its role in cellular signaling and interaction.

The tertiary structure of GPM6B involves the folding of these transmembrane helices, which is crucial for its functional conformation and interaction with other cellular components. The quaternary structure may involve interactions with other proteins, although specific details on these interactions are not provided in the available context.

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are likely to occur in GPM6B, influencing its function and localization within the cell. These modifications can affect the protein's stability, activity, and interactions with other molecules. Additionally, splice variants of the GPM6B gene may result in isoforms with distinct functional properties, potentially contributing to the diversity of its roles in cellular processes.

## Function
GPM6B, a four-transmembrane glycoprotein, is part of the proteolipid protein family and plays a significant role in various cellular processes. It is widely expressed in neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes, where it contributes to neuronal differentiation and myelination (Zhang2018Glycoprotein; Dere2015Gpm6b). In smooth muscle cells (SMCs), GPM6B is crucial for differentiation, interacting with the TGF-β-Smad2/3 signaling pathway. It directly binds to TβRI, enhancing the interaction between TβRI and Smad2/3, which is essential for SMC differentiation (Zhang2018Glycoprotein). This interaction facilitates the expression of SMC-specific markers and supports smooth muscle contraction and transcription of contractile fibers (Zhang2018Glycoprotein).

GPM6B is also involved in osteoblast differentiation, where its expression is modulated by vitamin D and activin A. It plays a critical role in bone formation by controlling the cytoskeleton and the release of matrix vesicles, which are essential for bone mineralization (Drabek2011GPM6B). In the nervous system, GPM6B interacts with the serotonin transporter (SERT), affecting serotonin uptake and modulating neurotransmission, which is crucial for mood regulation (Dere2015Gpm6b).

## Clinical Significance
The GPM6B gene has been implicated in several neuropsychiatric and neurocognitive conditions. A genome-wide association study identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in GPM6B associated with delay discounting, a trait linked to impulse control issues and conditions such as ADHD, schizophrenia, and major depression (Chung2023Whole). GPM6B expression is significantly down-regulated in the brains of individuals who have completed suicide, particularly in cases of depression, suggesting a role in mood disorders (Chung2023Whole).

In the context of cancer, GPM6B expression is altered in osteosarcoma, where it is regulated by the long non-coding RNA DLX6-AS1 through interactions with miR-200a-3p. This axis is crucial for osteosarcoma cell migration, invasion, and proliferation, indicating that GPM6B may act as an oncogenic factor in this cancer type (Wu2022LncRNA).

In breast carcinoma, GPM6B expression is elevated and correlates with cancer progression. It is suggested to play a role in modulating tumor cell apoptosis, potentially influencing the development of antiangiogenic therapies (BilecovaRabajdova2014Breast).

GPM6B has also been studied in the context of Parkinson's disease, where an SNP near the gene was associated with increased disease risk, although this finding was not consistently replicated (Le2021Common; Guen2020Common).

## Interactions
GPM6B, encoded by the GPM6B gene, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in the nervous system and other tissues. In the peripheral nervous system, GPM6B interacts with gliomedin, a transmembrane glial protein, through its olfactomedin domain. This interaction occurs in cis, meaning both proteins are present on the same membrane, contributing to the structural integrity and function of the nodes of Ranvier (Bang2017Glial). GPM6B also interacts with other components of the nodal complex, such as NrCAM and NF186, which are involved in the clustering and maintenance of Na+ channels at the nodes of Ranvier (Bang2017Glial).

In the central nervous system, GPM6B is associated with cholesterol-rich membrane domains, facilitated by its cholesterol recognition/interaction consensus (CRAC) motifs and sterol sensing domains (SSD). This association is crucial for myelination, as GPM6B binds to cholesterol and is involved in the formation of oligodendroglial membrane microdomains (Werner2013A). GPM6B's role in myelination is further highlighted by its interaction with proteolipid protein (PLP), where the absence of both proteins leads to severe hypomyelination (Werner2013A).
