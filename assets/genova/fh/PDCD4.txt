# PDCD4

## Overview
PDCD4 (programmed cell death 4) is a gene that encodes a protein functioning primarily as a tumor suppressor. The PDCD4 protein is characterized as a translation inhibitor, interacting with key components of the translation initiation machinery, such as eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A (eIF4A), to impede the process of cap-dependent translation. This interaction is facilitated by the protein's two MA3 domains, which are structurally similar to those found in eIF4G, allowing PDCD4 to effectively compete with eIF4G for binding to eIF4A (LaRondeLeBlanc2007Structural; Loh2009Structural). Beyond its role in translation inhibition, PDCD4 is involved in transcription regulation and apoptosis, contributing to its function in tumor suppression. The protein's expression is often downregulated in various cancers, correlating with poor prognosis and highlighting its potential as a biomarker for cancer progression and therapeutic outcomes (Yang2003The; Chen2003Loss).

## Structure
The PDCD4 protein is characterized by its two MA3 domains, nMA3 and cMA3, which are crucial for its function in inhibiting translation initiation. These domains are structurally similar to the MA3 domain of eIF4G, allowing PDCD4 to compete with eIF4G for binding to eIF4A, a key interaction in translation initiation (LaRondeLeBlanc2007Structural; Loh2009Structural). The MA3 domains consist of seven α-helices packed into a globular form, stabilized by hydrophobic interactions between conserved residues (LaRondeLeBlanc2007Structural).

The protein's tertiary structure involves the MA3 domains interacting with eIF4A in a nearly perpendicular manner, with each domain contacting both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of eIF4A (Loh2009Structural). PDCD4 forms a heterotrimeric complex with eIF4A, binding in a 2:1 stoichiometry, which is essential for its inhibitory function (Loh2009Structural; Chang2009Crystal).

PDCD4 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which regulate its stability and activity. These modifications are crucial for its role in translation regulation and tumor suppression (LaRondeLeBlanc2007Structural). The protein also contains a nuclear export signal (NES) and a nuclear localization signal (NLS), facilitating its shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm (LaRondeLeBlanc2007Structural).

## Function
The PDCD4 gene encodes a protein that functions as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting translation and regulating transcription in healthy human cells. PDCD4 interacts with eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A (eIF4A), an ATP-dependent RNA helicase, to inhibit its helicase activity, which is crucial for unwinding mRNA secondary structures during translation initiation. This interaction prevents eIF4A from binding to the C-terminal region of eIF4G, a scaffold protein in the translation initiation complex, thereby inhibiting cap-dependent translation (Yang2003The).

PDCD4 is highly expressed in transformation-resistant cells and is upregulated during apoptosis, indicating its role in maintaining normal cellular function and preventing tumorigenesis (Yang2003The). The protein is active in the cytoplasm, where it colocalizes with eIF4A, and its binding to eIF4A is essential for its transformation-suppressing activity (Yang2003The). PDCD4 also inhibits AP-1-dependent transcription, a process linked to tumor suppression, by preventing eIF4A from associating with eIF4G (Yang2003The).

The MA-3 domains of PDCD4 are crucial for its binding to eIF4A, and mutations in these domains disrupt this interaction, highlighting their importance in PDCD4's function as a translation suppressor (Yang2004A).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PDCD4 gene have significant clinical implications across various cancers. In gliomas, PDCD4 gene silencing is associated with 5' CpG island methylation, leading to reduced expression at the mRNA level. This silencing correlates with tumor growth, decreased apoptosis, and increased colony-forming capacity, suggesting a role in glioma progression and prognosis (Gao2009PDCD4). In lung cancer, reduced PDCD4 expression is linked to higher tumor grade and stage, with a significant association with poor prognosis. The loss of PDCD4 expression is observed in a majority of lung tumor samples, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Chen2003Loss).

In prostate cancer, PDCD4 acts as a tumor suppressor repressed by androgens. Its reduced expression contributes to tumor growth and castration resistance, with miR-21 identified as a key regulator that suppresses PDCD4 levels (Zennami2019PDCD4). In breast cancer, PDCD4 downregulation is associated with poor prognosis and drug resistance, with its expression being modulated by pathways involving miR-21 and HER2 activation (Cai2022Dissecting). These findings underscore the clinical significance of PDCD4 expression alterations in cancer progression and treatment outcomes.

## Interactions
PDCD4 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in translation regulation and tumor suppression. One of its primary interactions is with the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A (eIF4A), where PDCD4 inhibits eIF4A's helicase activity by binding to it in two distinct modes using its MA3 domains. This binding prevents RNA from associating with eIF4A, thereby inhibiting translation initiation (Chang2009Crystal).

PDCD4 also interacts with the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), which is crucial for its role in translation suppression. This interaction is independent of eIF4A and is necessary for PDCD4 to associate with ribosomal complexes and suppress the translation of specific mRNAs, such as c-myb (Fehler2014An).

Additionally, PDCD4 interacts with the Daxx protein, competing with Hausp for binding. This interaction affects the stability of Daxx and modulates the phosphorylation of p53 at serine 46, influencing p53's proapoptotic activity. PDCD4's interaction with Daxx also disrupts the Daxx-Hipk2 complex, further impacting p53 phosphorylation (Kumar2013Tumor).
