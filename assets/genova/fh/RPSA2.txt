# RPSA2

## Overview
RPSA2 is a gene that encodes the ribosomal protein SA 2, which is a component of the small 40S subunit of the ribosome. This protein plays a crucial role in the process of translation, facilitating the assembly of ribosomal RNA and proteins into functional ribosomes. Ribosomal protein SA 2 is categorized as a ribosomal protein, which is essential for protein synthesis within the cell. The gene and its encoded protein are involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of cell growth and proliferation. Mutations or dysregulation of RPSA2 can have significant implications for cellular function and may contribute to the pathogenesis of certain diseases (Qiu2020aarFDC).
