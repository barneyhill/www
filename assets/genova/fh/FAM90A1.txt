# FAM90A1

## Overview
FAM90A1 is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 90, specifically member A1. This gene is part of the FAM90 gene family, which is characterized by its involvement in transcriptional regulation. The protein encoded by FAM90A1 interacts with several key transcriptional regulators, including the BET family bromodomain proteins BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4, suggesting a role in modulating transcriptional elongation (Alerasool2021Identification). Notably, FAM90A1 contains a novel transactivation domain (TAD), which underscores its potential function in transcriptional activation (Alerasool2021Identification). The gene has been implicated in various diseases, including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and B-cell lymphomas, where it is frequently mutated, indicating its clinical significance in cancer biology (Guo2018Germline; Elvers2015Exome). Additionally, FAM90A1's hypermethylation status in non-functioning pituitary adenomas and its potential association with opioid dependence highlight its broader relevance in human health and disease (Wang2024Wholeexome; Chang2021Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
FAM90A1 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through mutations and alterations in its expression. In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), FAM90A1 is identified as a candidate gene with an in-frame insertion mutation present in 8 patients. This mutation is associated with subtype 3 of ESCC, which is characterized by a 'Background' signature and is linked to smoking and TP53 mutations. The somatic status of FAM90A1 in this subtype is significantly predictive of clinical outcomes, with a hazard ratio of 2.62, suggesting its potential clinical significance in ESCC (Guo2018Germline).

In B-cell lymphomas, FAM90A1 is the fourth most significantly mutated gene, with mutations occurring in 16% of cases. These mutations are functionally relevant, although the exact function of the gene remains unknown (Elvers2015Exome). FAM90A1 is also hypermethylated in non-functioning pituitary adenomas (NF-PAs), with methylation levels significantly correlated with patient prognosis, indicating a role in tumorigenesis and potential as a marker for pituitary adenomas (Chang2021Genetic).

Additionally, FAM90A1 has been evaluated in the context of opioid dependence, where it showed a potential association with a p-value of 6.06×10^-5, although it did not reach genome-wide significance (Wang2024Wholeexome).

## Interactions
FAM90A1, a member of the FAM90 gene family, has been identified as interacting with several proteins involved in transcriptional regulation. Notably, FAM90A1 interacts with the BET family bromodomain proteins BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4. These proteins are known to regulate transcriptional elongation, suggesting that FAM90A1 may play a role in transcriptional regulation through these interactions (Alerasool2021Identification). The study utilized affinity-purification coupled to mass spectrometry (AP-MS) and proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID) to map these interactions, indicating a robust methodological approach to identifying the interactome of FAM90A1 (Alerasool2021Identification).

The research also identified a novel transactivation domain (TAD) within FAM90A1, which was not predicted by existing algorithms, highlighting the importance of experimental validation in characterizing protein domains (Alerasool2021Identification). This novel TAD suggests that FAM90A1 may have a direct role in transcriptional activation, although the specific mechanisms and additional interacting partners remain to be fully elucidated. The interactions of FAM90A1 with these transcriptional co-factors suggest its potential involvement in complex regulatory networks within human cells.
