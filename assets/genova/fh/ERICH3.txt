# ERICH3

## Overview
ERICH3 is a gene that encodes the protein glutamate rich 3, which is primarily expressed in the brain and is implicated in neurotransmission and synaptic function. The protein is involved in vesicular processes, interacting with proteins such as clathrin heavy chain and adaptor-related protein complex 2 subunit alpha 2, which are essential for vesicle biogenesis and function (Liu2020ERICH3:). Although the precise molecular mechanisms of ERICH3 are not fully understood, it is suggested to influence serotonin metabolism, potentially affecting antidepressant treatment responses (Nguyen2021Selective; Gupta2016TSPAN5). The protein's stability is regulated through proteasome-mediated degradation, with certain genetic variations leading to decreased protein levels (Gupta2016TSPAN5). Further research is needed to elucidate the exact role of ERICH3 in serotonin regulation and its broader implications in neuropsychiatric conditions.

## Function
The ERICH3 gene encodes a protein involved in cellular processes related to neurotransmission and synaptic function, primarily active in the brain regions associated with emotional and cognitive functions. Although the exact molecular mechanisms of ERICH3 in healthy human cells are not fully elucidated, studies suggest that it may influence plasma serotonin concentrations through mechanisms not directly involving the expression of serotonin biosynthesis and metabolism enzyme genes (Gupta2016TSPAN5). 

ERICH3 is associated with proteasome-mediated degradation, as certain non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in the gene lead to decreased protein levels through this pathway (Gupta2016TSPAN5). This degradation process is significant because it affects the protein's stability and function, potentially influencing serotonin metabolism and response to antidepressant treatment (Gupta2016TSPAN5). 

In cell culture studies, changes in ERICH3 expression were linked to significant alterations in serotonin concentrations in the media, although they did not affect the expression of genes encoding serotonin pathway enzymes (Gupta2016TSPAN5). This suggests that ERICH3 may modulate serotonin levels through a yet-to-be-identified mechanism, highlighting the need for further research to clarify its role in serotonin regulation.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
ERICH3, a protein encoded by the human gene ERICH3, is involved in various protein-protein interactions, particularly those related to vesicular function. Co-immunoprecipitation assays have identified several proteins that interact with ERICH3, including clathrin heavy chain (CLTC), adaptor-related protein complex 2 subunit alpha 2 (AP2A2), and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit type 2 alpha (PIK3C2A). These proteins are known to play roles in vesicle biogenesis and function, suggesting that ERICH3 is associated with vesicular processes (Liu2020ERICH3:).

Western blot assays have validated the interactions of ERICH3 with CLTC, AP2A2, and PIK3C2A, and immunofluorescent costaining has shown colocalization of ERICH3 with CLTC in cytoplasmic vesicle-like structures. ERICH3 also partially colocalizes with vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) (Liu2020ERICH3:). In SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells, ERICH3 knockout led to decreased serotonin (5-HT) concentrations, indicating its role in neurotransmitter packaging or transport by vesicles (Liu2020ERICH3:).

ERICH3 also interacts with ALK and CUX1, proteins associated with antidepressant treatment response, further supporting its involvement in neuronal differentiation and function (Nguyen2021Selective).
