# SPDYE2

## Overview
SPDYE2 is a gene that encodes the protein speedy/RINGO cell cycle regulator family member E2, which is part of the Speedy/RINGO family known for its role in cell cycle regulation. The protein functions as a cell cycle regulator by activating cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which are essential for the progression of the cell cycle, particularly during the G1/S and G2/M transitions (Islam2020Computational). SPDYE2 is expressed in various human tissues, with significant expression during fetal development, particularly in the prefrontal cortex, indicating its potential involvement in early brain development (Wang2018Extensive). The gene is also implicated in cancer, with altered expression levels observed in several cancer types, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Wang2018Extensive). Despite its recognized roles, further research is needed to fully elucidate the clinical implications of SPDYE2 in human health and disease (Bosco2012Interferon).

## Function
SPDYE2, a member of the Speedy/RINGO family, plays a significant role in regulating the cell cycle by activating cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which are crucial for cell cycle progression, particularly during the G1/S and G2/M transitions (Islam2020Computational). This gene is broadly expressed across various human tissues, with notable expression during fetal development in the prefrontal cortex, suggesting its involvement in early brain development (Wang2018Extensive). SPDYE2 is part of a complex regulatory network, interacting with other Speedy family members through competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks mediated by common microRNAs, indicating its role in post-transcriptional regulation (Wang2018Extensive).

In addition to its role in normal physiological processes, SPDYE2 is implicated in cell proliferation and may influence processes like DNA replication and repair, impacting overall cellular health and growth (Islam2020Computational). The gene's expression pattern supports the out-of-testis hypothesis, where new genes initially gain function in the testis and then extend to other tissues, including the brain (Wang2018Extensive). SPDYE2's involvement in these molecular processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular function and organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
SPDYE2, a member of the Speedy/RINGO family, is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. It is notably upregulated in several cancer types, including breast cancer, kidney chromophobe, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, and lung squamous cell carcinoma (Wang2018Extensive). High expression levels of SPDYE2 are associated with poor patient survival in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, skin cutaneous melanoma, and uveal melanoma, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic biomarker in these cancers (Wang2018Extensive).

In gallbladder cancer, SPDYE2 is identified as a highly expressed cell cycle regulator in specific cancer clusters, indicating its involvement in the disease's progression (Pandey2020Integrated). Additionally, SPDYE2 is noted for its involvement in copy number variations, with studies showing it can have one to four additional copies duplicated in tandem, which may contribute to its role in cancer (Liao2023A).

Despite these associations, specific diseases or conditions directly resulting from SPDYE2 mutations or expression alterations are not extensively documented, highlighting the need for further research to fully understand its clinical implications (Bosco2012Interferon).
