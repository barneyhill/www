# FSCB

## Overview
FSCB, or fibrous sheath CABYR binding protein, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the structural and functional dynamics of sperm flagella. The protein, also named fibrous sheath CABYR binding protein, is categorized as a structural protein due to its role in maintaining the integrity of the fibrous sheath, a critical component of spermatozoa. This protein interacts with CABYR, a calcium-binding protein, and is essential for sperm motility and capacitation, processes vital for successful fertilization (Liu2011FSCB). While FSCB is crucial for these functions, studies have shown that it is not indispensable for male fertility, as evidenced by normal fecundity in FSCB knockout mice (Sun2020CRISPRCas9based). Beyond its reproductive role, FSCB has been implicated in neurological and developmental conditions, such as Tourette syndrome and cerebral palsy, through its association with copy number variants (Sundaram2010Tourette; McMichael2013Rare). Despite these associations, the broader clinical significance of FSCB mutations in human diseases requires further investigation (Dementieva2024Risk).

## Function
FSCB, or fibrous sheath CABYR binding protein, is involved in the structural integrity and function of the fibrous sheath of sperm flagella. It plays a crucial role in sperm motility by interacting with CABYR, a calcium-binding protein. FSCB is specifically expressed on the surface of the fibrous sheath of the spermatozoa principal piece and is phosphorylated by the PKA catalytic subunit, which is essential for spermatozoa capacitation, a critical step in fertilization (Liu2011FSCB). The phosphorylation of FSCB is closely linked to PKA activity, which is influenced by cAMP concentration, and this phosphorylation is a key molecular event in spermatozoa capacitation, affecting motility and the acrosome reaction (Liu2011FSCB).

FSCB phosphorylation occurs rapidly upon exposure to capacitating media and remains stable after 60 minutes, indicating its role in the regulation of sperm motility (Liu2011FSCB). The fibrous sheath, where FSCB is located, acts as a scaffold for glycolytic enzymes and signaling pathways, further regulating sperm motility (Liu2011FSCB). Despite its involvement in these processes, knockout studies in mice have shown that FSCB is not essential for male fertility, as males lacking FSCB exhibit normal fecundity (Sun2020CRISPRCas9based).

## Clinical Significance
The FSCB gene has been implicated in several neurological and developmental conditions through its association with copy number variants (CNVs). In Tourette syndrome (TS), a 450-kb deletion encompassing the entire FSCB gene was identified in two unrelated patients. This deletion was one of the recurrent exonic CNVs found in the study, suggesting a potential link between FSCB deletions and TS, although the study did not find a significant statistical difference in CNV occurrence between TS patients and controls, indicating the need for further research to establish clinical significance (Sundaram2010Tourette).

In cerebral palsy (CP), a 751-kb deletion involving the FSCB gene was identified and inherited from an unaffected mother. This CNV was considered potentially pathogenic, highlighting the possible role of inherited CNVs in the etiology of CP. The study suggests that such CNVs, including those affecting the FSCB gene, may contribute to CP and warrant further investigation (McMichael2013Rare).

Additionally, FSCB has been studied in the context of sperm motility and fertility in cattle, where it is noted for its role in sperm motility and capacitation. However, the clinical significance of FSCB gene mutations in human diseases beyond these associations remains to be fully elucidated (Dementieva2024Risk).
