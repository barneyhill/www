# C19orf25

## Overview
C19orf25, or chromosome 19 open reading frame 25, is a gene located on chromosome 19 that encodes a protein involved in intracellular transport processes. The protein encoded by C19orf25 is primarily associated with the regulation of STING (stimulator of interferon genes) trafficking, which is crucial for the innate immune response. It plays a significant role in the retrograde transport from the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a pathway essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper immune signaling. C19orf25 interacts with several protein complexes, including the NRZ complex, which is involved in ER-Golgi transport, and the STX18 SNARE complex, indicating its role as a regulatory subunit in these complexes (Gentili2024Classification; Pan2018Interrogation). The protein's involvement in these pathways underscores its importance in modulating immune responses and its potential implications in various diseases, including autoinflammatory disorders and neurodegenerative diseases (Gentili2024Classification).

## Structure


## Function
C19orf25 is implicated in the regulation of STING (stimulator of interferon genes) trafficking, a critical component of the innate immune response. The gene is associated with retrograde transport from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a process essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper immune signaling. C19orf25 clusters with USE1, a known regulator of Golgi-to-ER transport, suggesting a functional role in this pathway (Gentili2024Classification).

Knockout studies of C19orf25 have shown increased colocalization of STING with Golgi and autophagy markers, indicating its involvement in Golgi-to-ER recycling. This is supported by increased levels of STING and its phosphorylated forms in cells lacking C19orf25, which suggests that the gene plays a role in modulating STING activation and signaling (Gentili2024Classification).

The loss of C19orf25 enhances STING signaling, highlighting its regulatory function in STING trafficking. This regulation is crucial for controlling inflammatory and antitumor responses, as dysregulation can lead to diseases such as autoinflammatory disorders and neurodegenerative diseases (Gentili2024Classification).

## Clinical Significance
C19orf25 has been implicated in several conditions, although its clinical significance remains poorly characterized. In a study on STING trafficking, loss of C19orf25 was found to enhance STING signaling, suggesting a regulatory role in STING trafficking, which is important in inflammatory disorders and antitumor immunity (Gentili2024Classification). Additionally, C19orf25 was identified as part of a de novo 19p13.3 microdeletion in a patient with intellectual disability, hypotonia, and facial dysmorphisms, although the study did not specifically attribute these phenotypes to C19orf25 (Palumbo2016Clinical). 

In the context of dyslexia, a splice site acceptor variant of C19orf25 was identified in a family, indicating a potential link to the condition, though its function remains unknown (Eiberg2023Linkage). Furthermore, C19orf25 is involved in alternative splicing events, which are considered independent prognostic factors in ovarian carcinoma, although its specific role in this context is not detailed (Ouyang2021Alternative). These findings suggest that alterations in C19orf25 may contribute to various diseases, but further research is needed to fully understand its clinical implications.

## Interactions
C19orf25 is known to interact with several protein complexes, primarily within the cytoplasm. It selectively binds to the cytoplasmic module of the ZW10 protein complex family, specifically the NRZ complex, which includes NBAS, ZW10, and RINT1. This complex is involved in transport between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. Despite its interaction with ZW10, C19orf25 does not localize to the kinetochore, indicating its specific association with the cytoplasmic NRZ complex rather than the nuclear-localized RZZ complex (Pan2018Interrogation).

C19orf25 also shows top fitness correlations with members of the NRZ and the STX18 SNARE complex, which transiently docks the NRZ complex on the ER membrane. Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry experiments have confirmed the interaction between C19orf25 and RINT1/ZW10 from cytoplasmic extracts, suggesting that C19orf25 is an evolutionarily recent subunit of these complexes (Pan2018Interrogation).

Additionally, C19orf25 has been identified as linking the GARP and SNARE complexes, indicating physical interactions with proteins within these complexes. These interactions are conserved across different cell lines, such as 293T and HCT116 cells (Huttlin2020Dual).
