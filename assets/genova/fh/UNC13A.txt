# UNC13A

## Overview
UNC13A is a gene that encodes the protein unc-13 homolog A, also known as Munc13-1, which is a pivotal component in the regulation of synaptic vesicle priming and neurotransmitter release at synapses. Munc13-1 is categorized as a synaptic protein and is integral to the assembly of the SNARE complex, a critical step in synaptic vesicle docking and fusion. The protein is characterized by several functional domains, including C1, C2A, C2B, and MUN domains, which facilitate its role in calcium-dependent synaptic transmission and plasticity (Lipstein2017Synaptic; Willemse2023UNC13Ain). UNC13A is predominantly expressed in the presynaptic terminals of neurons within the central nervous system and neuromuscular junctions, where it is essential for maintaining efficient synaptic transmission and plasticity (Ma2022TDP43). Variants in the UNC13A gene have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), highlighting its clinical significance in neurological health and disease (Brown2021Common; Willemse2023UNC13Ain).

## Structure
The UNC13A gene encodes the Munc13-1 protein, which plays a critical role in synaptic vesicle priming and neurotransmitter release. The protein is approximately 200 kDa in size and contains several key domains that contribute to its function. These include the C1 domain, multiple C2 domains (C2A and C2B), and a large MUN domain, which is essential for SNARE complex assembly and synaptic vesicle docking (Lipstein2017Synaptic; Willemse2023UNC13Ain).

The C2 domains are calcium-binding motifs that help regulate synaptic transmission by interacting with other proteins and membranes. The C2A domain specifically binds to RIM proteins, facilitating the recruitment of calcium channels to the release site (Lipstein2017Synaptic; Willemse2023UNC13Ain). The MUN domain is crucial for the priming of synaptic vesicles and is involved in the transition of syntaxin-1 to an open conformation, which is necessary for SNARE complex formation (Piao2022(M)Unc13s page 1 of 5).

UNC13A also contains a calmodulin-binding domain, which is involved in activity-dependent refilling of the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles (Willemse2023UNC13Ain). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its activity and interactions. Multiple splice variants of UNC13A exist, potentially affecting its functional properties and interactions within the synaptic environment (Lipstein2017Synaptic).

## Function
The UNC13A gene encodes the Munc13-1 protein, which is essential for synaptic vesicle priming, a critical step in neurotransmitter release at nerve cell synapses. Munc13-1 regulates the conformation of syntaxin 1, promoting SNARE complex assembly to generate the readily releasable pool (RRP) of synaptic vesicles, facilitating efficient neurotransmission (Lipstein2017Synaptic). This protein is predominantly expressed in the presynaptic terminals of neurons in the central nervous system and neuromuscular junctions, where it plays a crucial role in synaptic transmission by preparing synaptic vesicles for fusion with the plasma membrane in response to an action potential and calcium influx (Brown2021Common; Ma2022TDP43).

Munc13-1 is involved in synaptic short-term plasticity, which is important for various brain functions, including neuronal network oscillations, motor and sensory input computation, and working memory (Lipstein2017Synaptic). The protein contains multiple functional domains, such as the C2A and MUN domains, which are crucial for its function, particularly in calcium-dependent processes (Lipstein2017Synaptic). In healthy human cells, the proper function of UNC13A is necessary for maintaining normal synaptic transmission and plasticity, which are essential for proper neurological function (Lipstein2017Synaptic).

## Clinical Significance
The UNC13A gene has been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, most notably amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Variants in UNC13A, particularly the C-allele at rs12608932, are associated with an increased risk of ALS and FTD, specifically subtype B of FTD-TDP, which is characterized by round TDP-43 inclusions and shorter survival (Willemse2023UNC13Ain). The presence of these genetic variants, combined with TDP-43 pathology, leads to the inclusion of cryptic exons in UNC13A mRNA, resulting in nonsense-mediated decay and reduced protein levels, which contribute to disease progression (Ma2022TDP43; Willemse2023UNC13Ain).

In ALS patients, the minor allele of the rs12608932 polymorphism is linked to distinct clinical characteristics, including higher age at symptom onset, increased frequency of bulbar onset, lower respiratory function, and reduced survival (Tan2020The). UNC13A is also associated with poorer cognitive functioning and higher rates of behavioral impairment, as well as increased incidence of FTD (Tan2020The). The mislocalization of TDP-43 protein in ALS and FTD leads to incorrect splicing of UNC13A transcripts, further exacerbating synaptic transmission impairments and synaptic loss (Brown2021Common; Willemse2023UNC13Ain).

## Interactions
UNC13A is involved in several critical interactions that facilitate synaptic transmission. It plays a key role in neurotransmitter release by interacting with Rab3-interacting molecule (RIM) proteins, which are essential for recruiting calcium channels and assembling SNARE complexes. These complexes include synaptobrevin, SNAP-25, and syntaxin-1, which are crucial for synaptic vesicle fusion at presynaptic terminals (Willemse2023UNC13Ain).

UNC13A also interacts with UNC18, mediating the docking process by assembling SNARE complexes. Its C1 domain is important for recruiting synaptic vesicles into readily releasable pools, while the C2A domain interacts with RIM to recruit calcium channels. The calmodulin binding domain of UNC13A is involved in activity-dependent refilling of these pools, and the C2B domain regulates recovery from high-frequency stimulation (Willemse2023UNC13Ain).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases like ALS and FTD, UNC13A's splicing is regulated by TDP-43 and other heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), which bind to its RNA. TDP-43 represses the inclusion of cryptic exons in UNC13A mRNA, a process that is crucial for maintaining proper protein expression levels (Koike2023TDP43).
