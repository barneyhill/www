# NXF2B

## Overview
The NXF2B gene encodes the nuclear RNA export factor 2B, a protein that plays a crucial role in the nuclear export of mRNA. This protein is part of the nuclear export factor (NXF) family, which is involved in the transport of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, a critical step in gene expression regulation. NXF2B is characterized by its ability to bind RNA and interact with other proteins involved in the mRNA export pathway, facilitating the translocation of mRNA through the nuclear pore complex. The proper functioning of NXF2B is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and ensuring the fidelity of mRNA transport, which is vital for protein synthesis and cellular function (Qiu2020aarFDC).
