# SIRPB1

## Overview
SIRPB1 is a gene that encodes the signal regulatory protein beta 1, a transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. This protein is primarily expressed on myeloid cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, and plays a pivotal role in immune cell signaling. SIRPB1 is involved in modulating immune responses through interactions with ligands on other cells, influencing processes like phagocytosis, cell adhesion, and migration, which are crucial for immune surveillance and homeostasis (Tang2023A). The protein is characterized by its extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains and is known to stimulate DAP12 and Syk tyrosine phosphorylation, leading to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (Tang2023A). SIRPB1's involvement extends beyond immune cells, affecting the glioma microenvironment and playing a role in various cancers and inflammatory diseases, making it a potential therapeutic target (Geng2024SIRPB1; Tang2023A).

## Structure
The SIRPB1 protein is a transmembrane protein that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily, characterized by its extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains. It is encoded by a gene that exhibits structural heterogeneity due to a common copy-number variation, resulting in four distinct isoforms: 201, 202, 204, and 205. These isoforms differ in their protein structure, expression levels, and functional roles (AlarcónMartín2024Beware).

Isoform 205 is the most commonly expressed and contains a crucial cysteine residue necessary for dimerization, suggesting it functions as a homodimer. In contrast, the other isoforms may function as monomers. The isoforms also vary in the number of Ig-like domains, with isoforms 201 and 204 having one domain, while isoforms 202 and 205 possess three. These structural differences influence their interaction with ligands and associated proteins, as well as their roles in various pathologies (AlarcónMartín2024Beware).

The transmembrane domain is essential for signal transduction, with isoform 202 having an alternative sequence compared to the others. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate the function of SIRPB1, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context (AlarcónMartín2024Beware).

## Function
SIRPB1 (Signal Regulatory Protein Beta 1) is a transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in immune cell signaling, primarily expressed on myeloid cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells. It is involved in modulating immune responses through its interactions with ligands on other cells, contributing to processes like phagocytosis, cell adhesion, and migration, which are essential for immune surveillance and homeostasis (Tang2023A).

At the molecular level, SIRPB1 is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is known to stimulate DAP12 and Syk tyrosine phosphorylation. This activation leads to the engagement of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, enhancing phagocytosis in macrophages (Tang2023A). The protein's function is also linked to the regulation of inflammatory responses, as evidenced by its role in cytokine-mediated signaling and leukocyte migration (Geng2024SIRPB1).

SIRPB1's activity is not limited to immune cells; it also influences the glioma microenvironment by regulating inflammatory factor expression via the SYK pathway. This regulation affects macrophage polarization and STAT phosphorylation, indicating its involvement in immune-related pathways and potential as a therapeutic target in gliomas (Geng2024SIRPB1).

## Clinical Significance
The SIRPB1 gene is clinically significant due to its involvement in various diseases, primarily through mutations and alterations in its expression levels. In cancer, SIRPB1 is implicated in breast and prostate cancers, where its expression promotes invasion and metastasis. High SIRPB1 expression is associated with poor survival rates in gliomas, and it is considered an independent prognostic factor for overall survival and progression-free interval in glioma patients (Geng2024SIRPB1; AlarcónMartín2024Beware). In prostate cancer, SIRPB1 gene amplification is linked to increased aggressiveness, with overexpression enhancing cell proliferation and migration through Akt activation (Song2020SIRPB1).

SIRPB1 also plays a role in inflammatory diseases. A rare frameshift variant in the SIRPB1 gene, identified as p. Leu381_Leu382fs, has been associated with increased susceptibility to Crohn's disease in a Han Chinese population. This variant leads to elevated SIRPB1 expression and activation of inflammatory pathways, contributing to the disease's pathogenesis (Tang2023A). These findings underscore the gene's potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in various conditions.

## Interactions
SIRPB1, a member of the signal regulatory protein family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence immune responses and cellular signaling. It interacts with the activating adaptor protein DAP12, which contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM). This interaction is crucial for the phosphorylation of Syk and MAPK, which are involved in increasing neutrophil migration and macrophage phagocytosis (Tang2023A). SIRPB1 also plays a role in the glioma microenvironment by binding to SYK through the DAP12 adaptor protein in macrophages. This interaction is essential for the phosphorylation of SYK, which influences the immune microenvironment by modulating inflammatory factor levels (Geng2024SIRPB1).

In the context of prostate cancer, SIRPB1 interacts with proteins involved in cell growth and motility, such as Cyclin D1, CDK2, CDK4, PARP, AMPK, P38, E-cadherin, β-catenin, and EGFR. These interactions suggest that SIRPB1 may regulate cell proliferation via Akt activation, as evidenced by increased CDK4 expression and enhanced Akt phosphorylation in SIRPB1-overexpressing cells (Song2020SIRPB1). These interactions highlight SIRPB1's role in various signaling pathways, potentially influencing cell cycle progression and apoptosis.
