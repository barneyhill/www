# ENAM

## Overview
The ENAM gene encodes enamelin, a critical protein involved in the formation and mineralization of dental enamel, the hardest tissue in the human body. Enamelin is a member of the secretory calcium-binding phosphoproteins (SCPP) family and is secreted by ameloblasts during the secretory stage of amelogenesis. It plays a pivotal role in the structural organization of the enamel matrix and the growth of hydroxyapatite crystals, which are essential for the hardness and resilience of enamel (Fukumoto2014New; Yan2017The). Enamelin's function is modulated by phosphorylation, particularly at Serine 55, which is crucial for its interactions with other enamel matrix proteins such as amelogenin and ameloblastin, facilitating the organized growth of enamel crystals (Yan2017The; Hu2014Enamelin). Mutations in the ENAM gene are linked to amelogenesis imperfecta, a group of inherited conditions that result in defective enamel formation, highlighting the gene's significance in dental health (Hart2003Novel; Kim2005ENAM).

## Function
The ENAM gene encodes the protein enamelin, which plays a crucial role in the formation and mineralization of dental enamel, the hardest tissue in the human body. Enamelin is secreted by ameloblasts during the secretory stage of amelogenesis, where it contributes to the structural organization of the enamel matrix and the growth of hydroxyapatite crystals, which are essential for the hardness and resilience of enamel (Fukumoto2014New; Yan2017The). 

Enamelin is part of the secretory calcium-binding phosphoproteins (SCPP) family and is phosphorylated by the Golgi-associated secretory pathway kinase FAM20C. This phosphorylation, particularly at Ser 55, is critical for enamelin's function, as it mediates protein-mineral interactions necessary for proper enamel formation (Yan2017The). 

In healthy human cells, enamelin interacts with other enamel matrix proteins, such as amelogenin, to regulate the assembly of these proteins and influence the formation of enamel crystals. This interaction is vital for the proper mineralization of enamel, ensuring the formation of strong and resilient enamel capable of withstanding masticatory forces (Gutiérrez2012Clinical).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ENAM gene are associated with amelogenesis imperfecta (AI), a group of inherited conditions affecting enamel formation. These mutations can lead to various forms of AI, including autosomal dominant and recessive types, characterized by enamel hypoplasia, which manifests as thin, rough, or discolored enamel (Hart2003Novel; Kim2005ENAM). Specific mutations, such as a 5-bp deletion in exon 10, result in a frameshift and premature termination of the enamelin protein, causing severe enamel defects (Gandolfi2013Simple). Another mutation, a 2 bp insertion in exon 10, is linked to autosomal recessive AI and results in generalized hypoplastic enamel and openbite malocclusion (Hart2003Novel).

ENAM mutations can also lead to localized enamel defects, such as enamel pitting, in heterozygous carriers, indicating a dose-dependent phenotype (Hart2003Novel). The genetic heterogeneity of AI suggests that different ENAM mutations can result in a spectrum of enamel defects, from minor pitting to severe hypoplasia (Kim2005ENAM). These findings underscore the critical role of enamelin in enamel development and the impact of its genetic alterations on dental health.

## Interactions
Enamelin (ENAM) is a critical protein involved in the formation of dental enamel, interacting with several other enamel matrix proteins to facilitate this process. Enamelin interacts with amelogenin and ameloblastin, two other key proteins in enamel formation, to promote the organized growth of enamel crystals. These interactions are essential for the structural integrity and mineralization of enamel (Bartlett2006Protein–Protein; Hu2014Enamelin). 

Enamelin is also known to interact with collagens at the dentin-enamel junction (DEJ), which may contribute to the mechanical properties of this transition zone (Bartlett2006Protein–Protein). Additionally, enamelin interacts with biglycan, a proteoglycan, suggesting a role in the assembly and organization of enamel matrix proteins (Bartlett2006Protein–Protein). 

The phosphorylation of enamelin, particularly at Serine 55, is crucial for its interaction with other enamel matrix molecules, such as ameloblastin. This phosphorylation is necessary for the structural organization of the enamel matrix and protein-mineral interactions during enamel formation (Yan2017The). These interactions highlight the complex network of protein interactions that enamelin participates in to ensure proper enamel development.
