# RNF130

## Overview
RNF130 is a gene that encodes the protein ring finger protein 130, a member of the PA-TM-RING family of transmembrane RING finger proteins. This protein is characterized by the presence of a RING-finger domain, a transmembrane domain, and a protease-associated (PA) domain, which collectively suggest its role as an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in protein ubiquitination processes (Nakamura2011The; van2009A). The RING-finger domain is essential for its function in facilitating interactions with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, while the PA domain is proposed to mediate protein-protein interactions, potentially influencing substrate recognition and binding (Nakamura2011The). RNF130 is implicated in cellular signaling and protein homeostasis, with its expression noted in certain cancer types, indicating a possible role in post-translational modifications relevant to cancer biology (Liu2023Expanding). Further research is needed to fully elucidate its specific functions and interaction partners.

## Structure
RNF130, a member of the RING finger protein family, is characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function. It contains a RING-finger domain, which is crucial for its role as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, facilitating interactions with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (Nakamura2011The; van2009A). The protein also features a transmembrane domain and a protease-associated (PA) domain, which is proposed to serve as a protein-protein interaction module, aiding in substrate recognition and binding (Nakamura2011The). 

RNF130 is part of the PA-TM-RING family, which is defined by these three conserved domains (Nakamura2011The). The PA domain adopts a fold similar to those found in subtilases and transferrin receptors, characterized by a central core formed by a parallel β-sheet surrounded by α-helices (Peng2013Structures). 

The protein is known to undergo auto-ubiquitination when interacting with specific E2 enzymes, such as UBE2D1 and UBE2D3, indicating its active role in ubiquitination processes (van2009A). RNF130 is also highly expressed in certain cancer types, suggesting potential post-translational modifications like ubiquitination that could be relevant to its function in these contexts (Liu2023Expanding).

## Function
RNF130, a member of the PA-TM-RING family of transmembrane RING finger proteins, is characterized by three conserved domains: the protease-associated (PA) domain, the transmembrane domain, and the RING-H2 finger domain. These domains suggest that RNF130 may be involved in protein-protein interactions and cellular signaling processes. The PA domain, in particular, is proposed to function as a protein-protein interaction module, facilitating the recognition and binding to substrate proteins (Nakamura2011The).

As a RING finger protein, RNF130 is likely to function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, a role common to this family of proteins. E3 ubiquitin ligases are crucial in the ubiquitination process, which tags proteins for degradation or regulates their activity, thereby influencing protein stability, trafficking, and activity regulation within the cell (Nakamura2011The). Although specific details about RNF130's function in healthy human cells are not provided, its classification within the PA-TM-RING family and its structural features suggest a role in these molecular processes. The involvement of RNF130 in immune response regulation and protein homeostasis is also implied, although further research is needed to elucidate its precise functions.

## Interactions
RNF130, also known as Goliath, is a member of the PA-TM-RING family of transmembrane RING finger proteins, which are characterized by a protease-associated (PA) domain, a transmembrane domain, and a RING-H2 finger domain. The PA domain is proposed to function as a protein-protein interaction module, facilitating the recognition and binding to substrate proteins. Although specific interactions involving RNF130 are not detailed, it is suggested that, similar to other family members like GRAIL, RNF130 may engage in protein-protein interactions through its PA domain (Nakamura2011The).

The PA domain of related proteins, such as GRAIL, is known to aid in binding to substrate proteins like CD154/CD40L and CD83, indicating a potential for RNF130 to participate in similar interactions (Nakamura2011The). However, the specific substrates or interaction partners of RNF130 have not been explicitly identified in the available literature. The study of RNF130's role in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) suggests its involvement in cellular processes related to protein degradation, but again, specific interaction partners are not mentioned (Kaneko2016Genomewide). Overall, while RNF130 is implicated in protein interactions, detailed interaction partners remain to be elucidated.
