# SDR16C5

## Overview
SDR16C5 is a gene that encodes the protein short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 16C member 5, which is part of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family. This protein plays a critical role in retinoid metabolism by catalyzing the oxidation of retinol to retinaldehyde, a key step in the biosynthesis of retinoic acid, an essential signaling molecule involved in cell differentiation and proliferation (Ebert2016Transcriptional; Wu2019Mice). SDR16C5 is expressed in various tissues, with significant activity in the skin, and its enzymatic function is dependent on the cellular environment (Wu2019Mice). The gene's expression and activity are regulated by factors such as the estrogen receptor, underscoring its importance in maintaining tissue homeostasis and its involvement in diverse physiological processes (Ebert2016Transcriptional). Additionally, SDR16C5 has been implicated in several cancers, where its expression levels can influence disease prognosis and patient outcomes, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Hong2023SDR16C5).

## Function
SDR16C5, also known as RDHE2, is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family involved in retinoid metabolism, specifically in the oxidation of retinol to retinaldehyde, a precursor for retinoic acid (RA) biosynthesis. This process is crucial for cell differentiation and proliferation, as RA acts as a signaling molecule in various biological processes (Ebert2016Transcriptional; Wu2019Mice). In humans, SDR16C5 is a functional gene with enzymatic activity, whereas its counterpart RDHE2S is considered a pseudogene, suggesting that SDR16C5 may fulfill the roles of both enzymes in humans (Wu2019Mice).

SDR16C5 is expressed in several tissues, with notable activity in the skin, where it contributes significantly to retinol dehydrogenase activity (Wu2019Mice). The enzyme's activity is dependent on additional cellular factors, as it is undetectable in isolated cell fractions but functional in living cells (Wu2019Mice). SDR16C5 is also implicated in the modulation of cell differentiation and proliferation through its role in retinoid metabolism, which is influenced by estrogen receptor regulation (Ebert2016Transcriptional). This highlights its importance in maintaining healthy tissue function and its potential involvement in various physiological processes.

## Clinical Significance
The SDR16C5 gene, also known as epidermal retinol dehydrogenase 2, has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its altered expression levels. In pancreatic cancer (PAAD), SDR16C5 is highly expressed and is associated with poor prognosis, promoting cell proliferation and migration while inhibiting apoptosis. This suggests its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in PAAD (Hong2023SDR16C5). High expression of SDR16C5 is also correlated with poor outcomes in other cancers, such as kidney renal clear cell carcinoma and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (Hong2023SDR16C5).

In contrast, decreased expression of SDR16C5 has been observed in triple-negative breast cancer, indicating its varied role across different cancer types (Wu2019Mice). Additionally, genome-wide association studies have linked the chromosomal region containing SDR16C5 to traits such as stature and growth in various species, suggesting its broader physiological impact (Wu2019Mice).

In oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, SDR16C5 expression varies with HPV status, potentially influencing patient survival (RandénBrady2024LRG1). These findings highlight the gene's significant role in cancer biology and its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic marker.
