# PDE4C

## Overview
PDE4C is a gene that encodes the enzyme phosphodiesterase 4C, which is part of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) family, specifically the PDE4 subfamily. This enzyme is a key regulator of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, a critical second messenger involved in numerous cellular processes such as signal transduction, inflammation, and mood regulation. Phosphodiesterase 4C hydrolyzes cAMP to 5' AMP, thereby modulating its concentration and influencing cellular responses to external stimuli (Houslay2001PDE4). The enzyme is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and is involved in the compartmentalization of cAMP signaling, which is essential for maintaining distinct pools of cAMP that are sensed by effectors like protein kinase A (PKA) (Houslay2001PDE4; Klussmann2016Protein–protein). PDE4C's activity is regulated through phosphorylation, which can alter its conformation and catalytic activity (Houslay2001PDE4). The gene is expressed in various tissues, including airway epithelial cells, and plays a significant role in modulating responses to inflammatory stimuli (Wright1998Phosphodiesterase).

## Structure
The phosphodiesterase 4C (PDE4C) enzyme is characterized by a highly conserved catalytic domain, which spans residues 200-558. This domain includes well-defined regions such as residues 201-332, 346-464, and 491-536, while certain segments like residues 333-345 of the H-loop and 465-490 of the M-loop are disordered (Wang2007Structures). The catalytic domain features a folding pattern with 16 α-helices, typical of PDE4 subfamilies, and contains a catalytic pocket divided into sub-pockets for metal and substrate binding. Essential zinc and magnesium ions are coordinated within the metal-binding pocket, crucial for catalytic activity (Wang2007Structures).

PDE4C exhibits structural similarities with other PDE4 subfamilies, as indicated by root mean square deviations (RMSDs) of the catalytic domains, yet it is more distantly related to them, with some key residues disordered (Wang2007Structures). The enzyme's primary structure shows high homology to PDE4A, B, and D, particularly in the UCR1 and UCR2 regions, suggesting conserved functional significance (Owens1997Molecular). PDE4C can exist in different active states, potentially due to post-translational modifications like phosphorylation, which may lead to different conformers (Owens1997Molecular).

## Function
PDE4C (phosphodiesterase 4C) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the regulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels within cells. cAMP is a second messenger involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction pathways that affect inflammation, memory, and mood regulation. PDE4C specifically hydrolyzes cAMP to 5' AMP, thereby modulating the intracellular concentration of cAMP and influencing cellular responses to external stimuli (Houslay2001PDE4).

The enzyme is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the compartmentalization of cAMP signaling. This spatial regulation is essential for maintaining distinct pools of cAMP, which are sensed by effectors such as protein kinase A (PKA), leading to specific cellular responses (Houslay2001PDE4; Klussmann2016Protein–protein). PDE4C's activity is regulated through phosphorylation by enzymes like ERK and PKA, which can alter its conformation and catalytic activity (Houslay2001PDE4).

In healthy human cells, PDE4C is expressed in various tissues, including airway epithelial cells, where it plays a role in modulating responses to inflammatory stimuli (Wright1998Phosphodiesterase). The enzyme's function in these cells is crucial for maintaining homeostasis and responding to environmental changes.

## Clinical Significance
PDE4C has been implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression and genetic mutations. In thyroid carcinoma (THCA), PDE4C is significantly up-regulated compared to normal tissues, and its higher expression is associated with poor prognosis and shorter progression-free survival in patients. This suggests that PDE4C could serve as a diagnostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target in THCA (Wang2024Elevated). The up-regulation of PDE4C in THCA might be linked to the inhibition of adenylate cyclases, which are involved in cAMP generation, indicating a unique role in cancer progression (Wang2024Elevated).

In the context of neuromuscular disorders, a heterozygous variant in the PDE4C gene has been identified in French bulldogs with muscle hypertrophy and gait abnormalities. This variant may contribute to increased muscle mass by elevating cellular cAMP levels, although the exact molecular mechanisms remain unclear (Shelton2024Variants). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of PDE4C in both cancer and muscle-related disorders, warranting further investigation into its role and therapeutic targeting.
