# CAND1

## Overview
CAND1 (cullin-associated and neddylation-dissociated 1) is a gene that encodes a regulatory protein involved in the modulation of cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs), which are pivotal in the ubiquitin-proteasome system for protein degradation. The CAND1 protein is characterized by its structure composed of HEAT repeats, which facilitate its role as a regulatory factor by interacting with unneddylated cullins. This interaction is crucial for the dynamic assembly and disassembly of CRL complexes, thereby influencing the availability of cullins for binding with substrate receptors and F-box proteins. CAND1's regulatory function is intricately linked to the neddylation/deneddylation cycle, which modulates its interaction with cullins and the activation of CRLs. The protein's ability to promote the exchange of F-box proteins within CRL complexes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and adaptability (Zheng2002CAND1; Wu2013CAND1).

## Structure
The CAND1 protein is characterized by a structure composed of 27 HEAT repeats, which form a sinuous super-helical arrangement. This configuration results in a U-shaped belt with two arms twisted in opposite directions. The structure includes three arches: one forming the base and two corresponding to the curved arms (Buonanno2017Disclosing). The HEAT repeats are crucial for protein-protein interactions, particularly in the context of CAND1's role in regulating cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) (Buonanno2017Disclosing).

The tertiary structure of CAND1 facilitates its function in modulating CRL activity, although specific details on the primary, secondary, or quaternary structures are not provided in the available context. The protein's interaction with cullins involves blocking the neddylation site, which is essential for its regulatory role (Helmstaedt2011Recruitment). While the context does not provide information on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms, these factors may influence CAND1's regulatory functions and interactions (Wang2024CAND1). The structural insights into CAND1 are primarily derived from crystallographic studies and molecular modeling (Buonanno2017Disclosing).

## Function
CAND1 (cullin-associated and neddylation-dissociated 1) is a crucial regulator of cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs), which are essential for protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. In healthy human cells, CAND1 modulates the assembly and disassembly of CRL complexes by binding to unneddylated cullins, such as CUL1, thereby influencing the availability of cullins for interaction with F-box proteins and other substrate receptors (Zheng2002CAND1; Wu2013CAND1). This binding is mutually exclusive with the binding of SKP1 and SKP2 to CUL1, thus regulating the formation of active SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein) complexes (Zheng2002CAND1).

CAND1 plays a dynamic role in the CRL1 network by promoting the exchange of F-box proteins, ensuring the flexibility and adaptability of the CRL1 repertoire to efficiently degrade substrates (Wu2013CAND1). This process is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and normal physiological functions, as it allows cells to respond to changes in substrate availability and cellular conditions (Wu2013CAND1). CAND1's regulatory function is also linked to the neddylation/deneddylation cycle, which modulates its interaction with cullins and the activation of CRLs (Wu2013CAND1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CAND1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and metabolic disorders. In prostate cancer, downregulation of CAND1 induces apoptosis, while its overexpression is linked to increased tumor proliferation and metastasis (Alhammad2022Bioinformatics). Similarly, in liver cancer, CAND1 overexpression correlates with poor overall survival, and its silencing induces apoptosis (Alhammad2022Bioinformatics). In ERα-positive breast cancer, higher CAND1 expression is associated with worse overall survival and increased tumor aggressiveness, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Alhammad2022Bioinformatics).

CAND1 also plays a role in cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. It acts as an antihypertrophic protein by promoting the degradation of calcineurin, a process crucial for mitigating cardiac hypertrophy (Li2022Cullinassociated). Overexpression of CAND1 in mice has been shown to alleviate cardiac dysfunction induced by pathological stress (Li2022Cullinassociated).

In non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), CAND1 is downregulated, leading to increased lipid accumulation and liver injury. Its overexpression reduces fat accumulation and ameliorates liver injury, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for NAFLD (Huang2023Cullinassociated).

## Interactions
CAND1 interacts with various proteins, primarily within the cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL) complexes. It binds to unneddylated cullins, such as CUL1, and prevents their neddylation by blocking the neddylation site, which is crucial for CRL activation (Zheng2002CAND1; Helmstaedt2011Recruitment). This interaction is mutually exclusive with the binding of the COP9 signalosome (CSN), which deneddylates cullins, suggesting that CAND1 inhibits CSN binding to CUL1 (Min2005CAND1).

CAND1 also interacts with components of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) complex. It binds to CUL1 independently of SKP1 and SKP2, preventing their association with CUL1 and thus regulating the formation of the SCF complex (Zheng2002CAND1). This interaction is modulated by the neddylation status of CUL1, with neddylation promoting SKP1 and SKP2 binding and causing CAND1 dissociation (Zheng2002CAND1).

In addition, CAND1 competes with Keap1 for binding to Cul3, affecting the ubiquitination of the Nrf2 transcription factor (Lo2006CAND1Mediated). CAND1's role extends to facilitating the dynamic exchange of F-box proteins within CRL complexes, acting as a transient exchange factor to maintain the balance and function of these complexes (Pierce2013Cand1; Wu2013CAND1).
