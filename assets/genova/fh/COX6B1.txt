# COX6B1

## Overview
The COX6B1 gene encodes the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 6B1, a crucial component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain's Complex IV, also known as cytochrome c oxidase (COX). This hydrophilic extramembrane protein plays a pivotal role in the electron transport chain by facilitating the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to oxygen, a process essential for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation (Massa2008Severe). COX6B1 is integral to the structural and functional integrity of the COX holoenzyme, contributing to the formation of mitochondrial supercomplexes that enhance bioenergetic efficiency (Kim2015Upregulation). Mutations in the COX6B1 gene can lead to mitochondrial complex IV deficiency, resulting in severe clinical conditions such as encephalomyopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, underscoring its critical role in cellular energy metabolism (Massa2008Severe; Abdulhag2014Mitochondrial).

## Function
The COX6B1 gene encodes a subunit of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), which is a crucial component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, specifically Complex IV. This enzyme complex is responsible for the final step of the electron transport chain, facilitating the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to oxygen, which is essential for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation (Massa2008Severe). COX6B1 is a hydrophilic extramembrane protein that faces the intermembrane space and is believed to connect the two COX monomers into the physiological dimeric form, interacting with cytochrome c (Massa2008Severe).

In healthy human cells, COX6B1 is essential for the proper assembly and function of the COX enzyme complex. It plays a critical role in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the COX holoenzyme, ensuring efficient mitochondrial respiration and energy production (Čunátová2020Role; Massa2008Severe). The COX6B1 subunit is involved in the formation of mitochondrial supercomplexes, which enhance mitochondrial bioenergetics by increasing the efficiency of electron transport and ATP production (Kim2015Upregulation). The presence of COX6B1 is crucial for the stability and activity of the COX complex, contributing to cellular energy metabolism and stress resistance (Kim2015Upregulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the COX6B1 gene, which encodes a subunit of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), are associated with mitochondrial complex IV deficiency, leading to a range of severe clinical conditions. These include encephalomyopathy, hydrocephalus, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Patients with COX6B1 mutations often present with symptoms such as metabolic acidosis, cardiomegaly, pulmonary hypertension, and cortical blindness. In some cases, these mutations result in severe infantile encephalomyopathy, characterized by leukodystrophic changes, muscle weakness, cognitive deterioration, and visual loss (Massa2008Severe; Abdulhag2014Mitochondrial).

Specific mutations, such as p.R20C and p.R19H, have been identified as pathogenic. These mutations disrupt the structural stability of the COX6B1 protein, leading to reduced COX activity and impaired mitochondrial function. The p.R20C mutation, for instance, affects a network of hydrogen bonds crucial for protein stability, while the p.R19H mutation compromises the stability and incorporation of COX6B1 into the COX holocomplex (Massa2008Severe; Abdulhag2014Mitochondrial).

The clinical manifestations of COX6B1 mutations underscore the gene's critical role in maintaining mitochondrial function and highlight the importance of including COX6B1 in diagnostic screenings for COX deficiency-related disorders (Massa2008Severe; Abdulhag2014Mitochondrial).

## Interactions
The COX6B1 protein, a subunit of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), is involved in several critical interactions within the COX complex. It interacts with core subunits COX2 and COX3, playing a role in the structural integrity of the COX holoenzyme or Complex IV (CIV) (TimónGómez2018Mitochondrial). COX6B1 is positioned on the intermembrane space side of the COX dimer, where it forms a bridge between COX monomers, facilitating their interaction (Gladyck2021Regulation). This subunit is also part of the cytochrome c binding site, which is crucial for electron transfer processes (Gladyck2021Regulation).

Mutations in COX6B1, such as R19H, can disrupt its interactions with other COX subunits, leading to reduced COX activity and improper assembly of the COX holocomplex (Massa2008Severe). These mutations affect the stability of COX6B1 and its incorporation into the COX complex, highlighting its role in maintaining the functional integrity of the enzyme (Čunátová2020Role). COX6B1's interaction with cardiolipin, a lipid involved in mitochondrial membrane structure, is also essential for its proper integration into the COX holocomplex (Massa2008Severe).
