# KLHL34

## Overview
KLHL34 is a gene that encodes the protein kelch-like family member 34, which is part of the kelch-like family of proteins. These proteins are characterized by their role as substrate adaptors in the Cullin-E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, a crucial component in the ubiquitin-proteasome system responsible for protein degradation. The KLHL34 protein contains several structural domains, including Kelch, BTB/POZ, and BACK domains, which facilitate its function in mediating protein-protein interactions and assembling the ubiquitin ligase complex (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics). The gene's expression and methylation status have been linked to radiosensitivity in cancer therapy, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for treatment response (Ha2015Epigenetic).

## Structure
KLHL34 is a member of the kelch-like family of proteins, which are characterized by the presence of specific structural domains that facilitate their function as substrate adaptors in the Cullin-E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. The protein structure of KLHL34 includes five or six Kelch domains, which are responsible for mediating substrate recruitment. These Kelch domains form a beta-propeller structure, contributing to the protein's tertiary structure and enabling protein-protein interactions (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics). 

KLHL34 also contains a BTB/POZ domain, which is involved in dimerization and binding to the Cullin E3 ligase, playing a crucial role in the assembly of the ubiquitin ligase complex. Additionally, the protein has a BACK domain, which links the BTB/POZ and Kelch domains, although its specific function remains uncertain (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics). 

The structure of KLHL34 may be subject to post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can regulate its activity and interactions. However, specific details on splice variant isoforms or additional structural data for KLHL34 are not provided in the available context. The presence of these domains and structural features highlights the role of KLHL34 in targeting proteins for degradation, impacting various cellular processes.

## Clinical Significance
KLHL34 has been implicated in the pathologic response to preoperative chemoradiation therapy (CRT) in rectal cancer patients. The gene's methylation status is a significant factor, with hypermethylation of KLHL34 being associated with increased radiosensitivity. This suggests that KLHL34 methylation could serve as a predictive biomarker for CRT response, potentially aiding in the personalization of treatment plans for rectal cancer patients (Ha2015Epigenetic). 

In colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines, higher methylation levels of KLHL34 correlate with lower expression of the gene. This epigenetic silencing can be reversed using DNA methylation and histone deacetylase inhibitors, indicating that methylation plays a crucial role in regulating KLHL34 expression. The silencing of KLHL34 has been shown to affect radiosensitivity, as its knockdown leads to decreased colony formation and reduced cell viability after irradiation. This suggests that KLHL34 expression may influence the response to radiation therapy, with its knockdown resulting in increased apoptosis, although it does not affect radiation-induced autophagy (Ha2015Epigenetic). 

These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of KLHL34 in cancer treatment, particularly in predicting and enhancing responses to radiation therapy.
