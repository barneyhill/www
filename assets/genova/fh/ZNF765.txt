# ZNF765

## Overview
ZNF765 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 765, a member of the KRAB zinc finger protein family, which is involved in the regulation of gene expression. The protein functions primarily as a transcription factor, binding to specific DNA sequences to modulate the transcriptional activity of target genes. It is particularly noted for its role in regulating the expression of LINE1 retroelements and tight junction-associated proteins, impacting processes such as RNA export and the permeability of the blood-tumor barrier (Helleboid2019The; Liu2020IGF2BP2). ZNF765's interactions with other proteins and long non-coding RNAs further underscore its complex regulatory functions in cellular processes. Its dysregulation has been implicated in various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma and glioma, suggesting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Liu2020IGF2BP2; Jin2019Comprehensive).

## Function
ZNF765 is a KRAB zinc finger protein that plays a role in the regulation of gene expression in human cells. It is known to bind to the promoter regions of specific LINE1 integrants, such as L1PA6 and L1PA5, suggesting a regulatory function over these retroelements (Helleboid2019The). ZNF765 is recruited to these promoter regions along with its interactors, ZKSCAN4 and ZC3H18, which are involved in RNA export, anabolism, and catabolism, indicating a potential regulatory role over LINE1 transcripts (Helleboid2019The).

In the context of glioma endothelial cells, ZNF765 acts as a transcription factor that binds to the promoters of tight junction-associated proteins, including ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-5, repressing their transcriptional activities. This repression affects the permeability of the blood-tumor barrier (BTB) by reducing the expression of these tight junction proteins (Liu2020IGF2BP2). Although the specific function of ZNF765 in healthy human cells is not directly addressed, its involvement in maintaining the integrity of barriers like the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is suggested through its modulation of tight junction protein expression (Liu2020IGF2BP2).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF765 has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression and interactions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ZNF765 is up-regulated and associated with poorer overall survival, indicating its potential role in cancer progression and prognosis (Jin2019Comprehensive). The gene is involved in transcriptional regulation, and its dysregulation may contribute to the development and progression of HCC.

In glioma, ZNF765 is part of the IGF2BP2/FBXL19-AS1/ZNF765 axis, which regulates blood-tumor barrier (BTB) permeability. The down-regulation of ZNF765 through this axis increases BTB permeability by inhibiting tight junction proteins, which can enhance the delivery and efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents like doxorubicin (Liu2020IGF2BP2). This suggests that targeting ZNF765 could be a therapeutic strategy for improving drug delivery in glioma treatment.

ZNF765 mutations have also been identified in chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (CHRCC), with mutations occurring in approximately 4.3% of cases. However, the specific clinical significance of these mutations in CHRCC is not well-documented (Testa2020Genetic). Overall, ZNF765's role in various cancers highlights its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target.

## Interactions
ZNF765 is involved in various interactions with both proteins and nucleic acids. It binds to the promoters of tight junction-associated proteins such as ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-5, repressing their transcriptional activities, which increases blood-tumor barrier (BTB) permeability (Liu2020IGF2BP2). ZNF765 also interacts with the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) FBXL19-AS1, which reduces the half-life of ZNF765 mRNA through the Staufen1-mediated mRNA decay (SMD) pathway. This interaction involves Alu element base-pairing, forming a Staufen1-binding site that recruits UPF1 to induce mRNA degradation (Liu2020IGF2BP2).

In the context of LINE1 elements, ZNF765 binds to L1PA6 and L1PA5 LINE1 integrants over their 5' untranslated regions, suggesting an initial role as an inhibitor of transposition. Despite escape mutations in the LINE1 lineage, ZNF765 continues to associate with these integrants, indicating a potential shift in its role (Helleboid2019The). ZNF765 is also recruited over the L1PA5/PA6 promoter region, with interactors ZKSCAN4 and ZC3H18 highlighted as potential regulators of LINE1 transcripts, involved in RNA export, anabolism, and catabolism (Helleboid2019The). These interactions suggest a complex regulatory network involving ZNF765 in both transcriptional repression and mRNA stability.
