# RFX4

## Overview
RFX4 is a gene that encodes the transcription factor Regulatory Factor X4, which is a member of the RFX family of transcription factors. This protein is characterized by a conserved winged-helix DNA-binding domain, enabling it to bind to X-box DNA elements and regulate gene expression. RFX4 plays a pivotal role in neuronal differentiation and brain development by modulating the expression of proneural genes, such as POU3F2 and NEUROD1, which are crucial for neuronal development. It is predominantly expressed in the brain and spinal cord, where it influences processes like axon guidance and brain morphogenesis. Additionally, RFX4 is involved in ciliary formation, sharing regulatory roles with other RFX family members. The gene's dysfunction is linked to various neuropsychiatric disorders and central nervous system abnormalities, highlighting its importance in maintaining proper neural function (Choi2024RFX4; Zhang2007Regulatory).

## Structure
RFX4 is a transcription factor characterized by a conserved winged-helix DNA-binding domain (DBD), which is crucial for its function in binding to X-box DNA elements (Zhang2007Regulatory; Wolfe2008Transcription). The protein lacks a transcriptional activation domain but includes a dimerization domain, suggesting its potential role as a transcriptional repressor or activator depending on the context (Zhang2007Regulatory; Wolfe2008Transcription). RFX4 can form heterodimers with other RFX family members, such as RFX2 and RFX3, but not with RFX1, indicating a specific quaternary structure in its interactions (Wolfe2008Transcription).

RFX4 has several splice variant isoforms, with RFX4_v3 being brain-specific and the most significantly expressed in the brain (Zhang2007Regulatory). These isoforms can differ in their domain composition, with some lacking the DNA-binding domain, which may influence their function and localization (SugiamanTrapman2018Characterization). The protein is also expressed in the testis, particularly in pachytene spermatocytes, where it may play a role in spermatogenesis by binding to the histone H1t promoter (Wolfe2008Transcription). The absence of certain domains in some isoforms suggests a complex regulatory role in transcription through selective interactions (SugiamanTrapman2018Characterization).

## Function
RFX4 (Regulatory Factor X4) is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in neuronal differentiation and brain development. It functions by regulating the expression of proneural genes such as POU3F2 and NEUROD1, which are essential for normal neuronal development. RFX4 acts as an upstream regulator, directly interacting with the promoters of these genes to enhance their expression, thereby promoting the differentiation of stem cells into neuronal cells through an intermediate neuronal progenitor cell (NPC) stage (Choi2024RFX4).

In healthy human cells, RFX4 is expressed in the brain and spinal cord, where it is involved in the regulation of gene expression related to neuronal development, axon guidance, and brain morphogenesis. It is particularly enriched in NPCs, where it regulates the NPC state through enhancer regions (Choi2024RFX4). RFX4 is also implicated in ciliary formation, as it shares regulatory roles with other RFX family members involved in ciliogenesis (Choi2024RFX4).

RFX4's activity is crucial for maintaining the proper development and function of the central nervous system, and its dysfunction is associated with various neuropsychiatric disorders and central nervous system abnormalities (Choi2024RFX4).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the RFX4 gene have been linked to several neurological disorders. RFX4 is implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability (ID), and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Variants in RFX4, along with other RFX family members, have been associated with these conditions, with studies identifying specific variants that are intolerant to loss-of-function mutations (Harris2020Disruption).

RFX4 is also involved in brain development, and its disruption can lead to congenital hydrocephalus. In mice, heterozygous disruption of the RFX4_v3 variant prevents the formation of the subcommissural organ, leading to hydrocephalus, while homozygous disruption results in severe brain morphogenesis issues and perinatal death (Zhang2007Regulatory).

In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a highly malignant brain tumor, high expression of RFX4 is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. RFX4 is crucial for the survival and self-renewal of glioma stem cells, contributing to the aggressiveness of the tumor (Jeong2020High). These findings suggest that RFX4 plays a significant role in both developmental and oncological brain disorders.

## Interactions
RFX4, a member of the RFX family of transcription factors, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in gene regulation. RFX4 can form dimers with other RFX family members, such as RFX2, RFX3, and itself, suggesting that it regulates transcription through selective interactions with these proteins (Zhang2007Regulatory). These interactions are crucial for its function in brain development and neuronal differentiation.

RFX4 directly interacts with the promoters of proneural genes such as POU3F2 and NEUROD1, which are essential for neuronal differentiation. This interaction is associated with changes in chromatin marks, indicating an active chromatin state that promotes gene expression (Choi2024RFX4). RFX4 binding motifs are enriched in enhancer regions, which are crucial for maintaining the neural progenitor cell state and are linked to neuronal differentiation pathways (Choi2024RFX4).

RFX4_v3, a variant of RFX4, is involved in brain morphogenesis and interacts with signaling pathways such as Wnt, BMP, and RA, which are essential for brain development (Zhang2007Regulatory). These interactions highlight the role of RFX4 in regulating complex transcriptional networks critical for neuronal development and function.
