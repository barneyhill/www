# NCKAP5L

## Overview
NCKAP5L is a gene that encodes the NCK associated protein 5 like, a centrosomal protein that plays a critical role in the regulation of microtubule dynamics and stability. This protein is categorized as a microtubule plus-end tracking protein, which is essential for maintaining the structural integrity and function of the cytoskeleton. NCKAP5L is involved in various cellular processes, including cell shape maintenance, division, and intracellular transport, by interacting with other proteins to facilitate cytoskeletal organization and cell migration. It is expressed in multiple human tissues, albeit with low tissue specificity, and is implicated in cellular signaling pathways that influence organismal development and immune responses. The protein's involvement in cancer biology and neurodevelopmental disorders underscores its significance in both normal physiological functions and disease states (Chahrour2012WholeExome; Sha2023Multi‑dimensional).

## Function
The NCKAP5L gene encodes a centrosomal protein involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics and stability, which is crucial for various cellular processes such as proliferation and invasion (Sha2023Multi‑dimensional). As a microtubule plus-end tracking protein, NCKAP5L plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the cytoskeleton, influencing cell shape, division, and intracellular transport. This protein is active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with other proteins to facilitate cytoskeletal organization and cell migration, impacting processes like cell adhesion and motility (Sha2023Multi‑dimensional).

In healthy human cells, NCKAP5L is expressed in various tissues, including the adrenal gland, lung, testis, prostate, and myocardium, although it exhibits low tissue specificity overall (Sha2023Multi‑dimensional). The gene's involvement in cellular signaling pathways suggests its role in organismal development and immune responses, as it influences cellular processes that are fundamental to these outcomes (Sha2023Multi‑dimensional). Despite its significant role in cancer biology, the fundamental functions of NCKAP5L in healthy cells underscore its importance in maintaining normal cellular and physiological functions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NCKAP5L gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders. In cancer, NCKAP5L is considered a promising biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis, especially in colorectal cancer. Its expression is upregulated in many cancer types, and high expression levels are associated with poor survival outcomes in cancers such as adrenocortical carcinoma, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, and ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (Sha2023Multi‑dimensional). Genetic alterations in NCKAP5L, predominantly mutations, are present in nearly all TCGA tumors, with skin cutaneous melanoma showing the highest alteration frequency (Sha2023Multi‑dimensional). 

In neurodevelopmental disorders, NCKAP5L has been identified as a candidate gene in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Mutations such as S1189N and A1066S have been identified in individuals with autism, suggesting a potential link to nervous system dysfunction (Chahrour2012WholeExome). These mutations are thought to be recessive and may contribute to the genetic heterogeneity observed in autism (Chahrour2012WholeExome). 

Overall, NCKAP5L's role in cellular signaling and actin cytoskeleton organization suggests its involvement in cancer metastasis and neurodevelopmental processes, highlighting its clinical significance in these conditions.

## Interactions
NCKAP5L, also known as Cep169, is involved in several protein interactions that play a role in cellular processes. It interacts with CDK5RAP2, a centrosomal protein, through its amino-terminal region. This interaction is crucial for regulating microtubule stability and is conserved across several vertebrate species (Mori2015Cep169). NCKAP5L also interacts with EB1, a core component of microtubule tip tracking, through SxIP EB1-binding motifs. These motifs are essential for NCKAP5L's localization at microtubule plus-ends, which is important for its function in microtubule dynamics (Mori2015Cep169).

In the context of cancer, NCKAP5L is part of a network of protein interactions that includes genes such as RBM5, RBM6, DVL2, and others, which are significantly positively correlated with NCKAP5L in various tumors. This suggests a role in tumorigenesis and development, particularly through its involvement in metabolic and cellular processes (Sha2023Multi‑dimensional). Additionally, NCKAP5L's phosphorylation patterns are altered in tumors, indicating its involvement in complex signaling pathways (Sha2023Multi‑dimensional). These interactions highlight NCKAP5L's potential significance in cancer biology and its role in cellular signaling networks.
