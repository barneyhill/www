# AGPAT4

## Overview
AGPAT4, or 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 4, is a gene that encodes a crucial enzyme involved in lipid metabolism. The protein product of AGPAT4 is categorized as an acyltransferase, specifically functioning in the biosynthesis of glycerophospholipids and triacylglycerol (TAG) by catalyzing the conversion of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) to phosphatidic acid (PA) (Mardian2017Agpat4Lpaatδ). This enzymatic activity is a key step in the Kennedy pathway, which is essential for the synthesis of various phospholipids, including phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (Takeuchi2009Biochemistry). AGPAT4 is predominantly active in the endoplasmic reticulum and is implicated in membrane biogenesis and energy storage, influencing cellular processes such as membrane dynamics and lipid homeostasis (Prasad2011Enzymatic). The protein's expression is notably high in the brain, suggesting a significant role in neural lipid metabolism (Mardian2017Agpat4Lpaatδ). While AGPAT4 is expressed in various tissues, its precise functions in healthy human cells are still being explored, with its involvement in lipid metabolism being a primary focus (Prasad2011Enzymatic).

## Function
AGPAT4 (1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 4) is an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of glycerophospholipids and triacylglycerol (TAG), playing a crucial role in lipid metabolism. It catalyzes the acyl-CoA-dependent formation of phosphatidic acid (PA) from lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a key step in the Kennedy pathway for phospholipid synthesis (Mardian2017Agpat4Lpaatδ). This enzymatic activity is essential for the production of phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), particularly in the brain, where AGPAT4 is highly expressed (Takeuchi2009Biochemistry; Mardian2017Agpat4Lpaatδ).

AGPAT4 is active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it contributes to membrane biogenesis and energy storage by facilitating the synthesis of phospholipids and triglycerides, which are vital components of cell membranes (Prasad2011Enzymatic). The enzyme's activity influences cellular processes such as membrane dynamics, signaling, and lipid homeostasis, impacting organismal outcomes like adipose tissue mass and potentially adipocyte differentiation (Mardian2017Agpat4Lpaatδ). While AGPAT4 is widely expressed in various tissues, its specific function in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated, though its role in lipid metabolism is implied by its expression pattern and similarity to other AGPAT isoforms (Prasad2011Enzymatic).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the AGPAT4 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly endometriosis and colorectal cancer. In endometriosis, AGPAT4 expression is significantly elevated in ectopic endometrial tissue compared to eutopic tissue, and its plasma levels are higher in patients with the condition. This upregulation is associated with increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in endometrial stromal cells, suggesting that AGPAT4 could be a therapeutic target for endometriosis (Chen2024Unraveling).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), AGPAT4 is upregulated in tumor tissues compared to adjacent non-cancerous tissues. This upregulation is linked to worse survival rates in CRC patients. AGPAT4 plays a role in lipid metabolic reprogramming, influencing the tumor microenvironment by modulating immune responses. Silencing AGPAT4 in CRC cells has been shown to suppress tumor growth in xenograft models, primarily through the activation of macrophages and T-cells via the p38/p65 signaling pathway. This suggests that AGPAT4 could be a potential target for CRC therapy (Zhang2020The).

AGPAT4's involvement in lipid metabolism and its dysregulation in these diseases highlight its clinical significance and potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target.

## Interactions
AGPAT4, also known as lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase delta (LPAATδ), is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its function in lipid metabolism and membrane dynamics. AGPAT4 is part of a protein complex that includes BARS, a protein that mediates membrane fission. When BARS is phosphorylated, it binds to AGPAT4, activating it to produce phosphatidic acid (PA), which is essential for the fission of post-Golgi carriers. This interaction is part of a larger complex involving other proteins such as the 14-3-3γ adaptor and phosphoinositide kinase PI4KIIIβ, which are recruited to the trans-Golgi network to facilitate membrane fission (Zhukovsky2019The).

AGPAT4 is also localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi, and mitochondria, suggesting its involvement in membrane dynamics, including fission and fusion processes (Zhukovsky2019The). However, the context does not provide specific information on direct interactions of AGPAT4 with nucleic acids. The enzyme's role in lipid metabolism and its interactions with other proteins highlight its importance in cellular processes related to membrane remodeling and lipid biosynthesis (Zhukovsky2019The).
