# LYG1

## Overview
LYG1 is a gene that encodes the protein lysozyme g1, which is a member of the lysozyme family known for its role in the immune system. Lysozyme g1 is involved in the degradation of bacterial cell walls, contributing to the body's defense mechanisms against bacterial infections. This protein is categorized as an enzyme due to its catalytic activity in breaking down peptidoglycan, a major component of bacterial cell walls. The expression and regulation of LYG1 have been linked to various physiological and pathological processes, including immune responses and cancer progression. Research has highlighted its potential involvement in immune-related disorders such as acute graft-versus-host disease and its differential expression in certain cancers, suggesting that LYG1 may serve as a biomarker or therapeutic target in these contexts (Kibriya2024Association; Liu2021LYG1).

## Clinical Significance
LYG1 (lysozyme g1) has been implicated in several clinical contexts, particularly in immune-related disorders and cancer. In the context of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), LYG1 deficiency in donor T cells has been shown to reduce the severity of the disease. This is achieved by altering T cell polarization, decreasing CD4+ T cell activation, and increasing the ratio of regulatory T cells (Tregs), which leads to a more regulatory immune response. Recombinant human LYG1 exacerbates aGVHD by promoting IFN-gamma production and inhibiting Foxp3 expression, suggesting that targeting LYG1 could be a therapeutic strategy to ameliorate aGVHD without affecting the graft-versus-tumor response (Liu2021LYG1).

In cancer, LYG1 expression has been associated with colorectal carcinoma, where it is upregulated in microsatellite instability (MSI) tumors, potentially contributing to inflammation-related pathways (Kibriya2024Association). Additionally, LYG1 is downregulated in non-invasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP), suggesting a role in distinguishing these tumors from other thyroid cancers (Lee2023Identification). In prostate cancer, LYG1 is regulated by the long noncoding RNA AD000684.2, indicating its involvement in cancer progression (Liang2023Identification).
