# DLC1

## Overview
DLC1 (Deleted in Liver Cancer 1) is a gene that encodes the DLC1 Rho GTPase-activating protein, a critical regulator of Rho family GTPases, which are involved in various cellular processes such as cytoskeletal organization, cell proliferation, and migration. The protein is categorized as a Rho GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP) and is characterized by several functional domains, including a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, a RhoGAP domain, and a steroidogenic acute regulatory-related lipid transfer (START) domain. These domains facilitate its interactions with other proteins and lipids, contributing to its regulatory functions. DLC1 acts as a tumor suppressor, and its inactivation through genetic alterations or epigenetic modifications is associated with increased tumorigenicity and metastasis in various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal cancer (Wilczek2011Deleted; SanchezSolana2021The; Wong2005Rho).

## Structure
The DLC1 protein is characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function as a Rho GTPase-activating protein. It contains a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain at the N-terminus, a RhoGAP domain centrally located, and a steroidogenic acute regulatory-related lipid transfer (START) domain near the C-terminus (Zhong2009The; Chau2022SH3). The SAM domain is unique with a four-helix bundle structure, differing from the typical five-helix arrangement found in other SAM domains. This domain is involved in binding to eukaryotic elongation factor 1A1 (EF1A1), which regulates cell migration (Zhong2009The).

The RhoGAP domain of DLC1 is specific for RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC GTPases and features a conserved structure with nine helices, including a core four-helix bundle and a V-shaped groove for interaction with the SH3 domain of p120RasGAP (Chau2022SH3). This interaction is crucial for the regulation of its GAP activity (Chau2022SH3).

DLC1 is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA), which enhances its RhoGAP activity and promotes dimerization, essential for its tumor suppressive functions (Ko2013PKAinduced). The protein also has multiple splice variants, which may affect its functional properties (Ko2013PKAinduced).

## Function
DLC1 (Deleted in Liver Cancer 1) is a Rho GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP) that plays a critical role in regulating the activity of Rho family GTPases, including RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC, which are involved in various cellular processes such as cytoskeletal organization, cell proliferation, and migration (Wilczek2011Deleted; Wong2005Rho). The RhoGAP domain of DLC1 promotes the hydrolysis of GTP bound to these GTPases, converting them to their inactive GDP-bound state, thereby negatively regulating Rho-mediated signaling pathways (Wilczek2011Deleted; Wong2005Rho).

In healthy human cells, DLC1 is essential for maintaining normal cytoskeletal organization and cell morphology by modulating the levels of active Rho proteins. This regulation is crucial for inhibiting stress fiber formation and controlling actin cytoskeletal remodeling (Wilczek2011Deleted). DLC1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is associated with focal adhesions, where it interacts with other proteins to exert its functions (Wong2005Rho).

The protein also contains a sterile α motif (SAM) and a steroidogenic acute regulatory-related lipid transfer (START) domain, which contribute to its regulatory functions and interactions with other cellular components (Wilczek2011Deleted). The START domain, in particular, is involved in lipid metabolism and signaling, further influencing cellular processes (Wong2005Rho).

## Clinical Significance
The DLC1 gene is a tumor suppressor that plays a significant role in various cancers due to its regulation of Rho GTPase activity. Alterations in DLC1, such as deletions, mutations, or reduced expression, are linked to increased tumorigenicity and metastasis. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), DLC1 is frequently downregulated or absent, with over 40% of primary HCCs and 90% of HCC cell lines showing lack of expression. This downregulation is often due to promoter hypermethylation, which is a common mechanism of its inactivation (XIE2015Significance; ZIMONJIC2012Role).

Mutations in the DLC1 gene, particularly in its START domain, can impair its tumor suppressor function by affecting its interactions with molecules like phosphatidylserine (PS), Caveolin-1, and PLCD1. These interactions are crucial for DLC1's ability to inhibit cell proliferation and migration, and mutations can lead to cancer progression, as seen in colorectal cancer (SanchezSolana2021The).

In gastric cancer, DLC1 expression is linked to the prevention of cancer progression, and its interaction with the CagA protein from H. pylori highlights a functional antagonism that affects RHO signaling. Low DLC1 expression is associated with poor therapeutic outcomes, particularly in advanced stages (Hinsenkamp2022Functional).

## Interactions
DLC1 (Deleted in Liver Cancer 1) is a Rho GTPase-activating protein that primarily interacts with Rho family proteins, such as RhoA and Cdc42, through its RhoGAP domain. This interaction enhances the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis activity of these proteins, converting them from their active GTP-bound forms to inactive GDP-bound forms, which is crucial for regulating cytoskeleton organization and actin stress-fiber formation (Wong2005Rho). 

The protein contains several functional domains, including a RhoGAP domain, a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, and a StAR-related lipid-transfer (START) domain. While the SAM domain is not essential for DLC1's tumor suppressor functions, the START domain is indispensable, suggesting that these domains may facilitate interactions with other proteins or lipids (Wong2005Rho). 

Although the context does not explicitly mention direct physical interactions of DLC1 with other proteins or nucleic acids, it implies that DLC1's interaction with Rho family proteins is mediated through its RhoGAP activity (Wong2005Rho). The study also suggests that cooperation among DLC1's multi-functional domains is required for its tumor suppressor functions (Wong2005Rho).
