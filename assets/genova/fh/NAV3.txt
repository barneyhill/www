# NAV3

## Overview
The NAV3 gene encodes the protein neuron navigator 3, which is a microtubule-associated protein involved in neuronal morphogenesis and axonal guidance. As a member of the navigator family, neuron navigator 3 is categorized as a microtubule plus-end tracking protein (+TIP), playing a pivotal role in microtubule dynamics and organization. The protein is characterized by several functional domains, including a calponin homology domain, coiled-coil domains, and an AAA-type ATPase domain, which facilitate its interactions with the cytoskeleton and its involvement in ATP binding and hydrolysis. These structural features enable NAV3 to participate in cytoskeletal reorganization, impacting cell shape, motility, and neural network formation. NAV3 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, heart, lungs, liver, and skeletal muscle, underscoring its involvement in diverse cellular functions and developmental processes (van2009Mammalian; Powers2023The).

## Structure
The NAV3 protein, encoded by the NAV3 gene, is a microtubule-associated protein involved in neuronal morphogenesis and axonal guidance. It consists of 39 coding exons and includes several functional domains crucial for its role in stabilizing microtubules. These domains include the Calponin homology (CH) region, microtubule-binding domain (MTBD), ATPases (AAA), and three coiled-coil regions (Ghaffar2024Variants). The CH domain facilitates binding with actin, while the MTBD interacts with microtubules, contributing to the protein's role in maintaining microtubule dynamics (Ghaffar2024Variants).

The AAA+ domain is part of the McrB family, suggesting that NAV3 may function as a GTPase (Powers2023The). The protein also contains SxIP motifs, which are associated with microtubule plus-end tracking proteins (+TIPs) (Powers2023The). NAV3's structure is characterized by conserved N-and C-terminal regions, with the N-terminal containing the CH domain and SxIP motifs, and the C-terminal including the coiled-coil domains and the AAA+ domain (Powers2023The).

NAV3 is expressed in various isoforms, which may affect regions outside the major conserved domains, potentially influencing interactions with the cytoskeleton (Powers2023The). These structural features underscore NAV3's critical role in neuronal development and function.

## Function
NAV3, also known as neuron navigator 3, is a protein involved in various cellular processes, primarily related to the cytoskeleton. It functions as a microtubule plus-end tracking protein (+TIP), which allows it to bind to the growing ends of microtubules, playing a crucial role in microtubule dynamics and organization (van2009Mammalian; Carlsson2012Neuron). This activity is essential for maintaining cellular structure and function, influencing processes such as cell migration and neurite outgrowth (Powers2023The; Uboveja2020p73).

NAV3 contains several functional domains, including a calponin homology domain, coiled-coil domains, and an AAA-type ATPase domain, which are involved in its interactions with the cytoskeleton and its role in ATP binding and hydrolysis (van2009Mammalian; Powers2023The). These domains enable NAV3 to participate in cytoskeletal reorganization, impacting cell shape and motility (van2009Mammalian).

In healthy human cells, NAV3 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, heart, lungs, liver, and skeletal muscle, indicating its involvement in diverse cellular functions and developmental processes (Powers2023The). Its role in cytoskeletal dynamics is crucial for proper neural network formation and axon guidance, impacting organismal outcomes such as neural development and cell signaling pathways (Powers2023The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NAV3 gene are associated with several neurological and oncological conditions. In nervous system tumors, NAV3 gene alterations, such as deletions and amplifications, are linked to tumor malignancy grade and prognosis. Amplifications of NAV3 are frequently observed in neuroblastomas and are associated with a better prognosis in gliomas, suggesting a link between increased NAV3 expression and less aggressive tumor behavior. Conversely, NAV3 deletions are associated with a poorer prognosis and are more common in higher-grade gliomas (Carlsson2012Neuron).

In primary cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL), including mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome, NAV3 deletions or translocations are common and are associated with disease progression and poor prognosis. These genetic alterations may serve as a biomarker for disease severity and prognosis in CTCL (Karenko2005Primary).

NAV3 variants are also implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability, developmental delay, and microcephaly. These variants affect the gene's ability to stabilize microtubules, leading to impaired neuronal morphogenesis and associated clinical symptoms (Ghaffar2024Variants).

## Interactions
NAV3, a protein encoded by the NAV3 gene, is involved in various interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It contains several domains, including AAA, ATP/GTP binding sites, leucine zipper, coiled-coil, SH3-binding, and calponin-like domains, which suggest its role in cellular signaling and interactions with other proteins (Karenko2005Primary). NAV3 interacts with microtubules, playing a role in stabilizing microtubule dynamics, which is essential for neuronal morphogenesis and axon guidance (Ghaffar2024Variants). The protein also contains SxIP motifs, which are associated with microtubule plus-end tracking proteins (+TIPs) and may mediate interactions with microtubule end-binding (EB) family proteins (Powers2023The).

In the context of cancer, NAV3 interacts with the tumor suppressor gene p73. NAV3 is a downstream target of p73, which regulates its expression. This interaction is significant in the suppression of colon cancer metastasis, as NAV3 knockdown increases cell migration and invasiveness, indicating its role as a metastasis inhibitor in a p73-dependent manner (Uboveja2020p73). These interactions highlight NAV3's involvement in both neuronal development and cancer biology.
