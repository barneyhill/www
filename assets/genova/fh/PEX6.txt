# PEX6

## Overview
The PEX6 gene encodes the peroxisomal biogenesis factor 6, a crucial component of the peroxisomal biogenesis process. This gene is responsible for producing a protein that belongs to the AAA-ATPase family, which plays a vital role in the assembly and maintenance of peroxisomes, cellular organelles involved in various metabolic functions, including fatty acid β-oxidation and detoxification of reactive oxygen species. The PEX6 protein forms a heterohexameric complex with PEX1, facilitating the ATP-dependent recycling of PEX5, a receptor essential for importing matrix proteins into peroxisomes. This process is critical for maintaining peroxisome function and preventing their degradation through pexophagy. Mutations in the PEX6 gene can lead to peroxisome biogenesis disorders, such as Zellweger spectrum disorders, highlighting its importance in cellular homeostasis (Judy2022Insights; Zhang1999Genomic; Pedrosa2019A).

## Structure
The PEX6 protein is a component of the Pex1/Pex6 ATPase complex, which is crucial for peroxisome biogenesis. PEX6, along with PEX1, forms a heterohexameric complex with alternating subunits, each possessing two N-terminal domains (N1 and N2) and two ATPase domains (D1 and D2) (Judy2022Insights; Gardner2015The). The ATPase domains form two stacked rings around a central pore, with the D2 ring being the active site for ATP hydrolysis, while the D1 ring assists in complex assembly (Gardner2015The; Blok2015Unique).

The N2 domains of PEX6 are positioned above the D1 ring, and the PEX6 N1 domain is equatorial to the D1 ring (Judy2022Insights). The N-terminal domains of PEX6 are thought to interact with membrane anchors such as Pex15 in yeast or PEX26 in humans, facilitating recruitment to the peroxisome membrane (Judy2022Insights; Gardner2015The). The PEX6 protein's structure is integral to the function and assembly of the Pex1/Pex6 complex, with its N-terminal domain contributing to the stability and interaction of the hexameric structure (Gardner2015The).

## Function
The PEX6 gene encodes a protein that is integral to peroxisome homeostasis in human cells. PEX6, in conjunction with PEX1, forms a heterohexameric motor complex that is part of the AAA-ATPase family. This complex is crucial for the import of matrix proteins into peroxisomes, organelles involved in metabolic processes such as fatty acid β-oxidation and detoxification of reactive oxygen species (Judy2022Insights; Pedrosa2019A). PEX6 facilitates the extraction of PEX5, a peroxisomal protein-shuttling receptor, from the peroxisomal membrane. This extraction is ATP-dependent and essential for recycling PEX5, allowing it to participate in new cycles of protein import (Pedrosa2018Peroxisomal; Waterham2012Genetics).

PEX6 is also involved in preventing peroxisome degradation through pexophagy by interacting with proteins such as Atg36 via Pex3 and Pex15 (Judy2022Insights). The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm and peroxisomal membrane, where it interacts with PEX26 to be recruited to the peroxisome membrane (Judy2022Insights). Mutations in PEX6 can lead to peroxisome biogenesis disorders, including Zellweger syndrome, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Zhang1999Genomic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PEX6 gene are a significant cause of Zellweger spectrum disorders (ZSS), which are a group of conditions affecting peroxisome biogenesis. These disorders include Zellweger syndrome, neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, and infantile Refsum disease, characterized by neurological impairment, liver dysfunction, and developmental delays (Schieferdecker2019Structural; Ebberink2010Spectrum). PEX6 mutations account for approximately 16% of ZSS cases, with 104 different mutations reported, including missense, nonsense, deletion, insertion, indel, and splice site mutations (Schieferdecker2019Structural).

The clinical presentation of PEX6-related disorders varies widely, from severe early-lethal forms to milder phenotypes. The severity is often correlated with the type of mutation, with homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for severe mutations typically resulting in more severe phenotypes (Schieferdecker2019Structural). Some mutations, such as the temperature-sensitive L57P mutation, can lead to milder phenotypes due to partial restoration of peroxisome function at lower temperatures (Imamura2000TemperatureSensitive).

PEX6 mutations are also implicated in Heimler syndrome, a milder condition characterized by sensorineural hearing loss, amelogenesis imperfecta, and nail abnormalities. This syndrome results from hypomorphic mutations that retain some peroxisomal function (Smith2016Spectrum).

## Interactions
PEX6, a peroxisomal biogenesis factor, interacts primarily with PEX1 to form a heteromeric complex essential for peroxisomal function. This interaction is ATP-dependent and involves the formation of a heterohexameric complex, which is crucial for the export of the PTS1-receptor Pex5p from the peroxisomal membrane to the cytosol (Saffian2012ATPdependent; Gardner2015The). The PEX1-PEX6 complex is involved in retrotranslocating PEX5 from the peroxisomal membrane, a critical function for peroxisome maintenance (Rinaldi2017The).

PEX6 also interacts with PEX26, which anchors the PEX1-PEX6 complex to the peroxisomal membrane. This interaction is facilitated when both nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) of PEX6 are ATP-bound, and it plays a role in regulating the ATPase activity of the complex (Saffert2017Structure). The interaction between PEX6 and PEX26 is crucial for recruiting the PEX1-PEX6 complex to peroxisomes, emphasizing the importance of the Walker motifs in PEX6 for peroxisomal localization (Tamura2006Dynamic).

Mutations in PEX6 that affect ATP binding can reduce its binding efficiency to PEX1 and impair peroxisomal localization, highlighting the significance of ATP in maintaining the integrity and function of the PEX1-PEX6 complex (Tamura2006Dynamic).
