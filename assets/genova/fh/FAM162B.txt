# FAM162B

## Overview
FAM162B is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 162 member B. This protein is part of a larger family characterized by conserved sequence motifs, although its specific biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. FAM162B is implicated in various cellular processes, potentially including roles in apoptosis and cellular stress responses, as suggested by its sequence homology with other family members. The protein encoded by FAM162B is not currently categorized as a kinase, receptor, or transmembrane protein, indicating that its function may be more specialized or context-dependent. Further research is needed to clarify its role in cellular pathways and its potential implications in human health and disease.
