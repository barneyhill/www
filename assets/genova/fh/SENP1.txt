# SENP1

## Overview
SENP1, or SUMO specific peptidase 1, is a gene that encodes a cysteine protease enzyme involved in the post-translational modification process known as SUMOylation. The protein product of SENP1, SUMO specific peptidase 1, plays a critical role in the regulation of cellular processes by removing SUMO (Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier) proteins from target substrates, thereby influencing their function, stability, and localization. This deSUMOylation activity is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating transcriptional activities, particularly within pathways such as Wnt signaling and hypoxia response (Hickey2012Function; Shin2012DeSUMOylating). SENP1 is predominantly active in the nucleus and interacts with various proteins, including nucleoporins and chromatin remodelers, to modulate gene expression and chromatin accessibility (Chow2012Two; RodríguezCastañeda2018The). Dysregulation of SENP1 expression has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer and diabetes, highlighting its clinical significance (Shao2015SENP1mediated; Taghvaei2021Evidence).

## Structure
The SENP1 protein is a cysteine protease involved in the processing and deconjugation of SUMO proteins. Its molecular structure includes a catalytic domain characterized by a papain-like fold, which is typical of the Ulp/SENP family of proteases (Kunz2018SUMOspecific). The catalytic domain of SENP1 spans amino acids 415-643 and contains a catalytic triad composed of cysteine (Cys602), histidine (His533), and aspartate (Asp550), essential for its enzymatic activity (Shen2006The; Ambaye2019Noncovalent).

The secondary structure of SENP1 includes a five-stranded mixed β-sheet and a central helix, with the key nucleophile Cys602 located at the N-terminus of the central helix (Shen2006The). The tertiary structure of SENP1 features a Trp tunnel that accommodates the SUMO C-terminal diglycine motif, crucial for substrate specificity (Hickey2012Function). SENP1 forms a complex with SUMO2 in a 1:1 stoichiometry, with the interaction driven largely by polar interactions and limited hydrophobic contacts (Ambaye2019Noncovalent).

Post-translational modifications of SENP1 include phosphorylation, which can modulate its enzyme activity and specificity (Li2022TCRInduced). The protein may also have splice variant isoforms, although specific details are not provided in the context.

## Function
SENP1 (SUMO specific peptidase 1) is a crucial enzyme involved in the regulation of SUMOylation, a post-translational modification process that attaches SUMO proteins to target proteins, influencing their function, stability, and localization. SENP1 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it deconjugates SUMO from substrates, thereby modulating their activity and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Hickey2012Function; Shin2012DeSUMOylating).

SENP1 plays a significant role in the regulation of transcriptional activities, particularly within the Wnt signaling pathway. It acts as a negative regulator by desumoylating transcriptional regulators TBL1 and TBLR1, which are involved in the dissociation from the NCoR-HDAC3 corepressor complex and the formation of a complex with β-catenin. This desumoylation decreases the activation of Wnt pathway target genes, highlighting SENP1's role in transcriptional regulation (Hickey2012Function).

SENP1 is also involved in the response to environmental stimuli such as hypoxia and androgen signaling. It desumoylates HIF1α, stabilizing it and affecting the expression of HIF1α target genes, which is crucial for cellular adaptation to hypoxic conditions (Hickey2012Function). These activities underscore SENP1's importance in various cellular processes and its potential impact on cellular stress responses.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SENP1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer and diabetes. In cancer, SENP1 is often overexpressed, contributing to tumor progression and poor prognosis. It is significantly overexpressed in several cancer types, including cholangiocarcinoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, esophageal carcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and thymoma, while being underexpressed in testicular germ cell tumors (Taghvaei2021Evidence). SENP1's role in cancer is linked to its involvement in deSUMOylation processes, which affect transcription factors and cellular processes like hypoxia response and mitosis (Taghvaei2021Evidence). In hepatocellular carcinoma, SENP1 enhances hypoxia-induced cancer stemness by stabilizing HIF-1α, promoting aggressive tumor behavior (Cui2017SENP1).

In the context of diabetes, SENP1 plays a role in regulating inflammatory responses. SENP1 deficiency in adipocytes leads to increased NF-kB activation and proinflammatory cytokine production, contributing to the progression of type-1 diabetes mellitus (Shao2015SENP1mediated). This inflammatory response is associated with autoimmune-mediated damage to pancreatic islet β cells, highlighting SENP1's significance in maintaining immune homeostasis (Shao2015SENP1mediated).

## Interactions
SENP1 (SUMO specific peptidase 1) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with the nucleoporin Nup153, where it binds to two distinct sites: the C-terminal domain and a newly identified region (residues 1,458-1,475). This interaction is enhanced by sumoylation, suggesting a regulatory role for SENP1 in association with Nup153 (Chow2012Two).

SENP1 also interacts with the chromatin remodeler CHD3, affecting chromatin accessibility and gene expression. This interaction involves multiple regions of CHD3, including the N-terminal domain, PHD-chromodomain region, and C-terminal CTD-region, while the central ATPase domain and DUF region do not bind to SENP1. The interaction is supported by co-immunoprecipitation and GST-pulldown assays, indicating a strong and specific binding (RodríguezCastañeda2018The).

In addition, SENP1 forms a complex with SUMO2, where its catalytic domain (residues 419-644) is active in cleaving poly-SUMO chains. The interaction is characterized by polar interactions and limited hydrophobic contacts, with the C-terminal motif of SUMO2 playing a crucial role in complex formation (Ambaye2019Noncovalent). These interactions highlight SENP1's role in modulating protein stability, localization, and activity through SUMOylation.
