# ZFAND3

## Overview
ZFAND3 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger AN1-type containing 3 protein, which is characterized by its zinc finger domains, specifically an A20-like domain and an AN1-like domain. These domains are integral to the protein's function, facilitating interactions with DNA and other proteins. The ZFAND3 protein is primarily involved in transcriptional regulation and is implicated in various cellular processes, including protein degradation pathways and cellular stress responses. It plays a significant role in the regulation of gene expression, particularly in the context of glioblastoma invasion and pancreatic beta cell function. The protein's interactions with DNA/RNA binding proteins and splicing factors suggest its involvement in RNA metabolic processes. ZFAND3 has been associated with clinical conditions such as glioblastoma and type 2 diabetes, highlighting its importance in both cancer progression and metabolic regulation (Schuster2020AN1type; Ndiaye2017Expression).

## Structure
The ZFAND3 protein is characterized by the presence of two zinc finger domains: an A20-like domain at the N-terminal and an AN1-like domain at the C-terminal. These domains are crucial for the protein's function, potentially mediating DNA-protein interactions (Schuster2020AN1type; Otake2011Molecular). The A20-like domain in ZFAND3 is unique, with only one residue between the first and second cysteine, deviating from the typical cysteine-rich sequence (Otake2011Molecular). The AN1-like domain also shows variation, with 13 residues between the second and third cysteine, which may influence the protein's three-dimensional structure and function (Otake2011Molecular).

ZFAND3 is involved in transcriptional regulation and is linked to glioblastoma invasion, with its activity dependent on nuclear localization and the integrity of its zinc finger domains (Schuster2020AN1type). The protein interacts with DNA/RNA binding proteins and splicing factors, suggesting a role in RNA metabolic processes and transcription (Schuster2020AN1type). The presence of (S/T)PXX sequences in ZFAND3 may facilitate weak DNA-protein interactions, supporting its potential function as a transcription factor (Otake2011Molecular).

## Function
ZFAND3 is a gene encoding a protein that contains a zinc finger AN1-type domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions. In healthy human cells, ZFAND3 is implicated in regulating protein degradation pathways, particularly the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Schuster2020AN1type). It plays a role in cellular stress responses and may influence transcriptional regulation by interacting with other proteins in the nucleus (Schuster2020AN1type). 

The protein is known to be involved in transcriptional regulation, acting through its nuclear localization. It interacts with DNA/RNA binding proteins, splicing factors, and helicases, suggesting a role in RNA metabolic processes and transcription (Schuster2020AN1type). ZFAND3 binds to promoter regions of genes associated with invasive signatures, indicating its role in a transcriptional invasion program (Schuster2020AN1type). 

In the context of pancreatic beta cells, ZFAND3 has been identified as a gene affecting insulin secretion, with its expression enriched in these cells. It is associated with glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and has been linked to type 2 diabetes susceptibility (Ndiaye2017Expression). The protein's specific function in healthy human cells, however, remains to be fully elucidated (Schuster2020AN1type).

## Clinical Significance
ZFAND3 has been implicated in the progression of glioblastoma (GBM), a highly aggressive form of brain cancer. Alterations in the expression of ZFAND3 are associated with increased invasiveness of GBM cells. The gene functions as a transcriptional regulator, and its elevated expression is observed in highly invasive glioblastoma stem-like cells compared to less invasive ones. Knockdown of ZFAND3 significantly reduces the invasion capacity of these cells, highlighting its role in promoting tumor invasiveness (Schuster2020AN1type). ZFAND3's nuclear localization and intact zinc finger domains are crucial for its activity, as mutations affecting these features impair its ability to drive invasion (Schuster2020AN1type).

In addition to its role in cancer, ZFAND3 has been linked to type 2 diabetes (T2D) susceptibility. A genome-wide association study identified a SNP at the ZFAND3 locus associated with T2D risk, which affects enhancer activity in human islets. Knockdown of ZFAND3 in pancreatic beta cells significantly impacts insulin secretion, suggesting its involvement in pancreatic islet function and potential contribution to T2D pathophysiology (Ndiaye2017Expression).

## Interactions
ZFAND3 is involved in various protein interactions that contribute to its role as a transcriptional regulator in glioblastoma invasion. It forms a protein complex with PUF60, Pontin (RUVBL1), and Treacle (TCOF1), which are associated with gene transcription and cell motility (Schuster2020AN1type). ZFAND3 binds to promoter regions of genes such as COL6A2, NRCAM, and FN1, which are linked to invasive signatures in glioblastoma, indicating its role in transcriptional regulation (Schuster2020AN1type).

The protein's activity is dependent on its nuclear localization and the integrity of its AN1 and A20 zinc finger domains, which are crucial for its function in promoting glioblastoma cell invasion (Schuster2020AN1type). ZFAND3 interacts with a nucleus-specific interactome that includes DNA/RNA binding proteins, splicing factors, and helicases involved in RNA metabolic processes and transcription (Schuster2020AN1type). 

Additionally, ZFAND3 has been shown to interact with proteasome-associated proteins such as PSMD1, PSMC3, and PSMD8, suggesting potential roles in cytoplasmic functions, although the link between its transcriptional activity and proteasomal function remains to be clarified (Schuster2020AN1type).
