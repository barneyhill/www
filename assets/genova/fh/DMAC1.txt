# DMAC1

## Overview
DMAC1 is a gene that encodes the protein Distal Membrane Arm Assembly Component 1, which plays a pivotal role in the assembly of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I. This protein is categorized as an assembly factor, essential for the proper construction and function of complex I, a key component in cellular energy production. DMAC1 is particularly involved in the assembly of the distal ND4 and ND5 modules of complex I, interacting with various subunits and proteins such as FOXRED1 and OXA1L to facilitate this process (Harada2023Protein; Formosa2018Building). The protein is localized to the mitochondria, where it undergoes N-myristoylation, a post-translational modification that aids in its mitochondrial targeting, although this modification does not solely determine its localization (Harada2023Protein). Through its interactions and modifications, DMAC1 is integral to the assembly and stabilization of complex I, underscoring its importance in mitochondrial respiration and energy metabolism (Linden2024Elucidation).

## Function
DMAC1 (Distal Membrane Assembly Component 1) is a critical protein involved in the assembly of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I, which is essential for cellular energy production. This protein is particularly important for the assembly of the 'distal' ND4 and ND5 modules of complex I. It interacts strongly with FOXRED1 and the subunits of the ND4 and ND5 modules, as well as with OXA1L, which is involved in the membrane insertion of these modules (Formosa2018Building). DMAC1 is also associated with newly synthesized, unassembled ND5, indicating its role in the early stages of complex I assembly (Formosa2018Building).

In addition to its role in complex I assembly, DMAC1 is localized to the mitochondria, where it functions as an assembly factor crucial for the proper assembly and function of complex I (Harada2023Protein). The protein is N-myristoylated, a modification that is important for its mitochondrial localization, although this modification does not affect its localization in the same way as it does for other proteins like NDUFB7 (Harada2023Protein). This localization is vital for its role in mitochondrial respiration and energy metabolism.

## Interactions
DMAC1 is involved in the assembly of mitochondrial complex I (CI) and participates in several protein-protein interactions crucial for this process. It has been identified to cross-link with NDUFB10, a subunit of the membrane arm of CI, indicating its role in CI assembly (Linden2024Elucidation). This interaction supports the hypothesis that DMAC1 is integral to the assembly and stabilization of CI, as knockout studies have shown that the absence of DMAC1 leads to defects in CI assembly (Linden2024Elucidation).

DMAC1 is also noted for its N-myristoylation, a post-translational modification that aids in its mitochondrial localization. This modification is crucial for its function in CI assembly, although it does not solely depend on N-myristoylation for mitochondrial targeting (Harada2023Protein). The protein's interactions within the mitochondrial environment are essential for the proper assembly and function of complex I, contributing to the overall efficiency of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. These interactions highlight DMAC1's role as a critical assembly factor within the mitochondrial matrix.
