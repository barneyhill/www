# CNOT7

## Overview
CNOT7 is a gene that encodes the protein CCR4-NOT transcription complex subunit 7, which is a critical component of the CCR4-NOT complex, a multifunctional regulator of gene expression. The protein is categorized as a poly(A)-selective ribonuclease, playing a pivotal role in mRNA deadenylation, a process essential for mRNA turnover and regulation of gene expression. CNOT7 is involved in various cellular processes, including mRNA decay, cell cycle regulation, and response to interferon signaling. It interacts with several proteins, such as BTG/Tob and STAT1, to mediate its functions. The gene's expression and the protein's activity have significant implications in health and disease, particularly in cancer and male infertility, where alterations in CNOT7 can influence tumor progression and spermatogenesis (Lu2024Oncogenic; Nakamura2004Oligoasthenoteratozoospermia; Lau2009Human; Shirai2014Multifunctional).

## Structure
CNOT7, also known as Caf1, is a subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex and plays a crucial role in mRNA deadenylation. It contains a DEDDh nuclease domain, which is essential for its catalytic activity, allowing it to function as a poly(A)-selective ribonuclease (Pavanello2023Regulation). The protein interacts with the MIF4G domain of CNOT1 and features a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain at the N-terminus of Ccr4, contributing to its structural and functional integration within the complex (Pavanello2023Regulation).

CNOT7 binds to CNOT1 through conserved hydrophobic residues, involving a surface formed by a long loop and an α-helix, which undergoes a conformational change upon binding (Chalabi2020The). This interaction is crucial for allowing RNA molecules access to its active site. CNOT7 and its paralogue CNOT8 have largely redundant roles, but they also exhibit unique functions, as evidenced by specific phenotypic defects in CNOT7 null mice (Chalabi2020The).

The structure of the CCR4-NOT complex, including CNOT7, has been studied using x-ray crystallography and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, revealing significant distances between the catalytic centers of Caf1 and Ccr4, which may suggest unique functions or conformational changes during mRNA deadenylation (Pavanello2023Regulation).

## Function
CNOT7, a subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex, plays a crucial role in mRNA metabolism, primarily through its deadenylase activity, which shortens the poly(A) tail of mRNA molecules, leading to mRNA decay and regulation of gene expression (Lau2009Human). This activity is essential for mRNA turnover and is involved in various stages of RNA processing, including synthesis, degradation, and splicing (Lau2009Human). CNOT7 is active in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, shuttling between these compartments to link nuclear and cytosolic functions of the CCR4-NOT complex (Lau2009Human).

In healthy human cells, CNOT7 interacts with BTG/Tob proteins, which regulate cell cycle progression, and this interaction is necessary for the anti-proliferative activities of Tob proteins (Shirai2014Multifunctional). CNOT7 also regulates class I and II interferon pathways by controlling STAT1 trafficking and degrading STAT1-regulated mRNAs (Shirai2014Multifunctional). The alternative splicing of CNOT7 results in two isoforms, CNOT7v1 and CNOT7v2, which have distinct roles. CNOT7v1 is involved in mRNA deadenylation and translational control, while CNOT7v2 is associated with nuclear processes such as arginine methylation and alternative splicing (Chapat2017Alternative). These activities highlight CNOT7's multifaceted role in mRNA regulation and cellular function.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CNOT7 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and male infertility. In glioma, a type of brain tumor, CNOT7 is highly expressed and associated with poor prognosis. Its elevated expression is linked to increased tumor grade and is more prevalent in samples with IDH mutations and non-codel 1p/19q co-deletion status. High CNOT7 expression promotes glioma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting its role as an oncogene. Knockdown of CNOT7 in glioma cells suppresses these malignant behaviors, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Lu2024Oncogenic).

In the context of male infertility, CNOT7 is crucial for normal spermatogenesis. Mice lacking the Cnot7 gene exhibit oligo-astheno-teratozoospermia, characterized by low sperm count, poor motility, and abnormal morphology, leading to sterility. This condition is linked to impaired function of Sertoli cells and disrupted interaction with the retinoid X receptor beta (Rxrb), which is essential for normal testicular function (Nakamura2004Oligoasthenoteratozoospermia).

CNOT7 also plays a role in tumor metastasis, particularly in breast cancer. It is involved in post-transcriptional regulation, influencing metastasis-associated transcripts. Alterations in CNOT7 expression or its interactions with adaptor proteins like TOB1 and CNOT1 can enhance metastatic potential, making it a potential target for anti-metastatic therapies (Faraji2016Posttranscriptional).

## Interactions
CNOT7, a subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex, participates in various protein interactions that influence mRNA regulation and gene expression. It interacts with STAT1 in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells, forming a complex that dissociates upon interferon (IFN) treatment, allowing STAT1 to migrate to the nucleus. This interaction is specific and not RNA-mediated, as confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and in situ proximity ligation assays (Chapat2013hCAF1CNOT7). CNOT7 also interacts with core components of the CCR4-NOT complex, such as CNOT1, CNOT2, CNOT3, CNOT6, and CNOT10, integrating into the complex and participating in mRNA deadenylation (Chapat2017Alternative; Petit2012The).

CNOT7 has a variant, CNOT7v2, which interacts more strongly with PRMT1, a methyltransferase enzyme, compared to CNOT7v1. This interaction regulates PRMT1 activity, particularly in the methylation of SAM68, a substrate of PRMT1 (Chapat2017Alternative). CNOT7 also interacts with tristetraprolin (TTP) in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells, suggesting a role in TTP-mediated mRNA decay (Shi2014CNOT7hCAF1). These interactions highlight CNOT7's role in posttranscriptional regulation and its involvement in various cellular processes.
