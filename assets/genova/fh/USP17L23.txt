# USP17L23

## Overview
USP17L23 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquitin specific peptidase 17 like family member 23, which is part of the deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) family. These enzymes play a critical role in the regulation of ubiquitin-dependent processes by removing ubiquitin moieties from target proteins, thereby influencing their stability, localization, and activity. The USP17L23 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, and immune response modulation. As a member of the ubiquitin-specific protease family, it contributes to the fine-tuning of protein degradation pathways, which are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental changes. Dysregulation of USP17L23 has been implicated in several pathological conditions, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Qiu2020aarFDC).
