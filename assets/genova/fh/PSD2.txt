# PSD2

## Overview
The PSD2 gene encodes the protein pleckstrin and Sec7 domain containing 2, which is involved in various cellular processes, including membrane trafficking and signal transduction. This protein is characterized by the presence of pleckstrin homology (PH) and Sec7 domains, which are crucial for its function in cellular signaling pathways. The PH domain is known for its role in binding phosphoinositides, which are important for membrane association, while the Sec7 domain is involved in guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity, particularly for ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) proteins. These domains enable the protein to participate in the regulation of vesicular trafficking and cytoskeletal dynamics, contributing to its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Qiu2020aarFDC).
