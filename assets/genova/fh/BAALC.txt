# BAALC

## Overview
The BAALC gene, which stands for Brain And Acute Leukemia, Cytoplasmic, encodes a protein that plays a significant role in cellular signaling pathways, particularly in hematopoietic and neuroectodermal cells. The BAALC protein functions as a scaffolding protein, interacting with key signaling molecules such as MEK kinase-1 (MEKK1) and influencing pathways like the ERK pathway, which are crucial for cell growth and differentiation (Morita2015BAALC; Birgersson2021A). It is membrane-anchored through lipid modifications, facilitating its role in cell adhesion and locomotion (Lang20201H). Clinically, BAALC is of particular interest due to its overexpression in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where it is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to treatment (Schwind2010BAALC; Mrózek2006Clinical). The gene's expression is tightly regulated during cell differentiation, and its dysregulation is implicated in the pathogenesis of leukemia, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Marjanovic2020Prognostic).

## Structure
The BAALC protein is a human protein consisting of 180 amino acids, with six known isoforms. The longest isoform, isoform 1, is 181 residues long and has been expressed and purified for structural studies (Lang20201H). The protein is membrane-anchored through myristoylation and palmitoylation at its N-terminus, which are common post-translational modifications that facilitate membrane association (Lang20201H).

The primary structure of BAALC includes a sequence that allows for these lipid modifications, which are crucial for its localization and function. While specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not provided, the study of its backbone nuclei using NMR spectroscopy suggests ongoing efforts to characterize these aspects (Lang20201H).

BAALC is expressed in hematopoietic and neuroectodermal cells, and its expression is down-regulated during cell differentiation. Overexpression of BAALC is associated with poor outcomes in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML), indicating its clinical significance (Lang20201H). The protein's function in inhibiting differentiation by desensitizing cells to retinoic acid-induced proliferation arrest highlights its role in cellular signaling pathways (Lang20201H). 

The gene is located on chromosome 8q22.3 and is highly conserved in mammals, suggesting an important evolutionary role (Lang20201H).

## Function
The BAALC (Brain And Acute Leukemia, Cytoplasmic) gene is primarily expressed in CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells during normal hematopoiesis, but its expression is lost as these cells differentiate and is nearly absent in mature peripheral blood cells (Marjanovic2020Prognostic). In healthy human cells, BAALC is involved in cell adhesion and locomotion, suggesting a role in cellular signaling pathways that regulate these processes (Marjanovic2020Prognostic). The protein encoded by BAALC acts as a scaffolding protein, influencing cell cycle progression by interacting with MEK kinase-1 (MEKK1) and affecting ERK activity, which are critical pathways in cell growth and development (Birgersson2021A). Although the specific function of BAALC in healthy cells is not extensively studied, its expression in neural and hematopoietic tissues indicates a role in maintaining the balance between cell proliferation and differentiation (Birgersson2021A). The gene's interactions with proteins such as MAP3K1 and KLF4 further suggest its involvement in complex signaling networks that regulate cellular responses to external stimuli (Morita2015BAALC).

## Clinical Significance
The BAALC gene is clinically significant in various hematological malignancies, particularly acute myeloid leukemia (AML). High expression of BAALC is associated with poor prognosis in AML patients, especially those with normal cytogenetics. It negatively impacts event-free survival (EFS), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) in adults under 60 with de novo AML, particularly in patients with wild-type FLT3 or those with FLT3-ITD who also express the wild-type FLT3 allele (Mrózek2006Clinical). In older patients with cytogenetically normal AML, low BAALC expression correlates with better outcomes, including higher complete remission rates and longer DFS and OS (Schwind2010BAALC).

BAALC overexpression is also linked to a higher likelihood of relapse and shorter relapse-free survival post-transplant in AML patients, particularly those with certain cytogenetic variants like t(8;21) (Shakirova2019Clinical). The gene's expression is associated with leukemic CD34+ precursor cells, which are implicated in AML relapse (Shakirova2019Clinical). Monitoring BAALC expression levels, especially in combination with WT1 gene expression, can serve as a prognostic marker for post-transplant relapse in AML patients (Shakirova2019Clinical).

## Interactions
The BAALC protein is involved in several significant interactions with other proteins, contributing to its role in cellular signaling pathways. In the context of leukemia, BAALC interacts with DBN1, an actin-binding protein that promotes cell adhesion and mobility. This interaction is crucial for anchoring BAALC-expressing leukemic cells in the bone marrow, leading to resistance to cytotoxic drugs (Maki2021Physical). 

In the brain, the BAALC 1-6-8 protein specifically interacts with the α subunit of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKIIα), but not with the β subunit. This interaction is facilitated by the N-terminal 35-amino-acid region of BAALC 1-6-8 and the C-terminal end of the regulatory domain of CaMKIIα, indicating a CaMKIIα-specific interaction (Wang2005BAALC). 

In breast cancer, BAALC interacts with focal adhesion kinase (FAK), leading to increased phosphorylation of FAK and enhanced cell migration and invasion. This interaction is associated with increased secretion of active MMP-9, a matrix metalloproteinase involved in extracellular matrix degradation and tumor vascularization (Birgersson2021A). 

BAALC also interacts with MEKK1 and KLF4, potentiating the oncogenic ERK pathway in leukemia cell lines (Morita2015BAALC). These interactions highlight BAALC's role in various cellular processes across different tissues.
