# PAXX

## Overview
PAXX, also known as PAXX non-homologous end joining factor, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the DNA repair process, specifically within the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway. The PAXX protein is a member of the XRCC4 superfamily and functions as an accessory factor in the classical NHEJ (c-NHEJ) pathway, which is crucial for repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in mammalian cells. Structurally, PAXX is characterized by an N-terminal globular head domain and a C-terminal coiled-coil stalk, facilitating its role in forming stable homodimers and interacting with the Ku protein complex, a key component of the NHEJ machinery (Tadi2016PAXX; Liu2017PAXX). Although not essential for the basic c-NHEJ process, PAXX enhances the assembly and stability of the NHEJ complex, promoting genomic stability and cellular survival (Ochi2015PAXX; Tang2022Role). Its clinical significance is underscored by its potential role as a prognostic marker in cancer and its involvement in modulating responses to genotoxic therapies (Liu2017PAXX; Arora2020PAXX).

## Structure
The PAXX protein, a member of the XRCC4 superfamily, is involved in DNA double-strand break repair through the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway. Structurally, PAXX is characterized by an N-terminal globular head domain and a C-terminal coiled-coil stalk, which facilitates the formation of stable homodimers. This dimerization is similar to that observed in other NHEJ factors like XRCC4 and XLF (Tadi2016PAXX; Liu2017PAXX). The PAXX dimer is stabilized by a coiled-coil formed by a 31-amino-acid α-helix (Ochi2015PAXX).

The C-terminal region of PAXX is crucial for its interaction with the Ku protein complex, a key component in the NHEJ pathway. Specific residues, such as V199 and F201, are essential for this interaction, and mutations at these sites can disrupt PAXX's function in DNA repair (Ochi2015PAXX). PAXX does not directly bind to DNA but interacts with DNA-bound Ku, forming a stable ternary complex (Tadi2016PAXX).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, have been identified in PAXX, although these modifications do not appear to be affected by DNA damage treatment (Tadi2016PAXX). The protein may also exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context.

## Function
The PAXX gene encodes a protein that functions as an accessory factor in the classical non-homologous end joining (c-NHEJ) pathway, a primary mechanism for repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in mammalian cells. PAXX interacts with the Ku70/80 heterodimer, a core component of the c-NHEJ machinery, and is involved in the repair of complex or 'dirty' DSBs (Tadi2016PAXX). Although PAXX is not essential for the basic c-NHEJ process, it promotes the assembly of the c-NHEJ machinery, particularly in conjunction with the XRCC4-like factor (XLF) (Tadi2016PAXX). PAXX stabilizes the assembly of NHEJ proteins, including Ku, DNA-PKcs, XRCC4, and XLF, on chromatin at sites of DNA damage, which is crucial for the ligation of DNA ends by the XRCC4/LIG4 complex (Ochi2015PAXX).

PAXX is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to genomic stability and cellular survival by facilitating the repair of DSBs (Tang2022Role). Despite its role in DNA repair, PAXX is dispensable for V(D)J recombination, a process of genetic recombination in the immune system, and does not exhibit a core c-NHEJ phenotype (Tadi2016PAXX). PAXX's function in c-NHEJ is somewhat redundant with XLF, as both factors can compensate for each other in certain contexts (Tadi2016PAXX).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PAXX gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer. In colon cancer, elevated PAXX expression is associated with poor overall and disease-specific survival, making it a potential independent prognostic marker. This overexpression correlates with hypomethylation of the PAXX promoter and is linked to oncogenic pathways and reduced tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, suggesting a role in cancer progression and immune evasion (Arora2020PAXX).

PAXX is also implicated in the sensitivity of cancer cells to genotoxic therapies. PAXX-deficient human cancer cell lines exhibit increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation, indicating its role in modulating responses to DNA-damaging treatments (Liu2017PAXX). In glioma cells, PAXX is involved in resistance to the chemotherapy drug temozolomide, potentially through its role in the base excision repair pathway (Tang2022Role).

While PAXX mutations might not be easily recognized in humans due to mild phenotypes in PAXX-deficient mice, potential clinical manifestations could include late-onset immunodeficiency or myeloid proliferative diseases (Liu2017PAXX). The gene's interactions with other DNA repair factors, such as XLF, further complicate its clinical significance, as combined deficiencies can lead to severe conditions like severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) (Kumar2016PAXX).

## Interactions
PAXX, a component of the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair pathway, interacts with several key proteins involved in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. It directly binds to the Ku protein complex, which is essential for DSB repair, through its C-terminal region. This interaction is crucial for stabilizing the assembly of NHEJ proteins, including Ku, DNA-PKcs, XRCC4, and XLF, on chromatin in response to DNA damage (Xing2015Interactome; Ochi2015PAXX). PAXX also forms a stable complex with DNA-bound Ku, enhancing the stability of the NHEJ complex and promoting the ligation of non-cohesive DNA ends in an XLF-dependent manner (Xing2015Interactome).

PAXX interacts with DNA polymerase λ (Pol λ) to stimulate its activity, which is essential for recruiting Pol λ to DNA damage sites. This interaction involves the DNA-bound Ku heterodimers and requires the C-terminal region of PAXX (Craxton2018PAXX). PAXX's interaction with Pol λ is facilitated by the BRCT domain of Pol λ, and this association is confirmed through immunoprecipitation experiments (Craxton2018PAXX).

Mutations in the C-terminal region of PAXX, such as V199A/F201A, disrupt its interaction with Ku, impairing its function in DNA repair (Ochi2015PAXX). These interactions highlight PAXX's role as a scaffold that stabilizes the NHEJ machinery at DSB sites.
