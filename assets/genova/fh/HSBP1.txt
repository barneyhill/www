# HSBP1

## Overview
HSBP1 (Heat Shock Factor Binding Protein 1) is a gene that encodes a small, regulatory protein involved in cellular stress responses and structural assembly processes. The protein encoded by HSBP1 is characterized as a coiled-coil protein, which forms a hexameric structure through dimerization of trimers. It plays a pivotal role in modulating the heat shock response by interacting with and inhibiting the activity of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), thereby acting as a negative regulator of heat shock transcription (Liu2009Crystal; Satyal1998Negative). Additionally, HSBP1 is integral to the assembly and stability of the WASH complex, a critical component in actin cytoskeleton dynamics, by interacting with the CCDC53 subunit (Visweshwaran2018The). This dual functionality underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and facilitating essential cellular processes such as integrin recycling and cell migration (Visweshwaran2018The).

## Structure
The human gene HSBP1 encodes the heat shock factor binding protein 1, a small protein consisting of 76 amino acids with a predicted mass of 8.5 kDa (Visweshwaran2018The; Liu2009Crystal). The primary structure of HSBP1 includes heptad repeats and a highly conserved phenylalanine residue at position 27, which is unusual for trimeric coiled coils (Visweshwaran2018The; Liu2009Crystal).

The secondary structure is characterized by a long alpha-helix formed by residues 6-49, which assembles into a parallel three-helix bundle homotrimer (Liu2009Crystal). The tertiary structure involves the self-association of the helix into a parallel, symmetrical, triple coiled-coil helix bundle (Liu2009Crystal). 

The quaternary structure of HSBP1 is a dimer of trimers, forming an elongated, symmetrical hexamer (Liu2009Crystal). This hexamerization involves antiparallel helix-helix interactions, forming a small hydrophobic cavity (Liu2009Crystal). The protein is known to self-assemble into homo-oligomers in solution (Liu2009Crystal).

HSBP1 is ubiquitously expressed and localized in the nucleus, interacting specifically with the active trimeric form of HSF1, inhibiting its activity (Liu2009Crystal). The protein does not have 280-nm absorption, and its concentration is determined using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method (Liu2009Crystal).

## Function
HSBP1 (Heat Shock Factor Binding Protein 1) is a small protein that plays a crucial role in the assembly of the WASH complex, a multi-subunit molecular machine involved in actin cytoskeleton dynamics and cellular processes such as integrin recycling and cell migration. HSBP1 specifically interacts with the CCDC53 subunit of the WASH complex, promoting its assembly by dissociating the precursor trimeric form of CCDC53. This interaction is essential for the stability and function of the WASH complex, as it helps mask the VCA domain of the WASH protein, preventing deleterious activation of the Arp2/3 complex in the cytosol (Visweshwaran2018The).

In healthy cells, HSBP1 also functions as a negative regulator of the heat shock transcription factor HSF1. It terminates HSF1 transcription by dissociating the active HSF1 trimer, thereby modulating the heat shock response and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Visweshwaran2018The). HSBP1's role in the assembly of the WASH complex is further supported by experiments showing that depletion of HSBP1 leads to decreased levels of CCDC53 and WASH, indicating its specific role in stabilizing certain subunits (Visweshwaran2018The). This protein is active in both the cytosol and the nucleus, highlighting its diverse functional roles in cellular processes.

## Interactions
HSBP1 (heat shock factor binding protein 1) is involved in several protein interactions that play crucial roles in cellular processes. It specifically interacts with the trimerization domain of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), negatively regulating the heat shock transcriptional response. This interaction is dependent on the hydrophobic repeats within HSF1's trimerization domain, and mutations in these residues disrupt the interaction (Satyal1998Negative). HSBP1 also associates with Hsp70 during the attenuation phase of the heat shock response, suggesting a role in the conversion of HSF1 from its active trimeric form to an inert monomeric state (Satyal1998Negative).

In addition to its role in the heat shock response, HSBP1 is a critical assembly factor for the WASH complex, interacting specifically with the CCDC53 subunit. This interaction facilitates the assembly and stability of the WASH complex, which is essential for actin polymerization and integrin trafficking. HSBP1 forms a mixed heterotrimer with CCDC53, which is crucial for the stability of the WASH complex components (Visweshwaran2018The). These interactions highlight HSBP1's multifaceted role in cellular stress responses and structural assembly processes.
