# GNPDA2

## Overview
GNPDA2 is a gene that encodes the enzyme glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase 2, which plays a critical role in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. This enzyme is involved in the conversion of glucosamine-6-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate and ammonia, a reaction that is essential for nutrient sensing and cellular energy homeostasis (GutierrezAguilar2021CNS). As a cytoplasmic enzyme, glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase 2 is implicated in the regulation of metabolic processes, particularly in the hypothalamus and adipose tissue, where it influences lipid and glucose metabolism (GutierrezAguilar2021CNS). The gene's expression is modulated by dietary conditions and has been associated with metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, as well as neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (LachénMontes2024Involvement; GutierrezAguilar2021CNS). Through its interactions with various proteins, GNPDA2 is also linked to pathways involved in ciliary function and neurodegeneration, underscoring its multifaceted role in human health and disease (LachénMontes2024Involvement; Wang2022Identification).

## Function
GNPDA2 (glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase 2) is an enzyme involved in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, which is crucial for nutrient sensing and cellular energy homeostasis. It catalyzes the conversion of glucosamine-6-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate and ammonia, a process that influences metabolic pathways and cellular functions (GutierrezAguilar2021CNS). In healthy human cells, GNPDA2 is highly expressed in the hypothalamus and adipose tissue, suggesting a role in energy and glucose homeostasis. It is involved in regulating lipid and glucose metabolism and may play a part in adipogenesis (GutierrezAguilar2021CNS).

GNPDA2's activity is primarily located in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the regulation of metabolic processes. Its expression is influenced by dietary conditions, being down-regulated in the hypothalamus under a high-fat diet, which may contribute to an obese and insulin-resistant phenotype (GutierrezAguilar2021CNS). The enzyme's role in glucose homeostasis is highlighted by studies showing that central inhibition of GNPDA2 leads to glucose intolerance, indicating its importance in maintaining glucose balance rather than controlling appetite (GutierrezAguilar2021CNS). These functions underscore GNPDA2's significance in cellular and organismal metabolic regulation.

## Clinical Significance
GNPDA2 (glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase 2) has been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases and metabolic disorders. Alterations in GNPDA2 expression have been observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD), where its overexpression is linked to disruptions in cell projection organization and ciliary dysfunction, contributing to amyloid-beta accumulation. This overexpression affects gene expression related to ubiquitination and O-GlcNAcylation, processes involved in neurodegeneration (LachénMontes2024Involvement). In zebrafish models, GNPDA2 overexpression has been shown to interfere with Tau protein levels and modulate proteins involved in metabolic pathways, potentially exacerbating neurodegenerative processes (LachénMontes2024Involvement).

In metabolic contexts, GNPDA2 has been associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Genetic variants in GNPDA2, such as SNP rs1996023, have been linked to T2D and childhood obesity, suggesting a regulatory role in these conditions (Zeng2019Identification). The GNPDA2-GABRG1 locus has been identified as significant for body mass index (BMI) in a Taiwanese population, indicating its involvement in adiposity traits (Wong2022Genomewide). These findings highlight the gene's role in both neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders, suggesting that GNPDA2 may influence disease susceptibility through its impact on metabolic and cellular pathways.

## Interactions
GNPDA2 (glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase 2) is involved in various protein interactions that suggest its role in metabolic and neurodegenerative pathways. The protein was found to coimmunoprecipitate with 93 other proteins in human nasal epithelial cells, indicating a broad interactome. Notably, GNPDA2 interacts with proteins involved in intraciliary transport, such as PCM1, CEP131, IFT81, AP2M1, IFT172, LRRC7, ATP2B4, and TUBB2A, suggesting a potential role in ciliary function (LachénMontes2024Involvement).

GNPDA2 also shares interactors with amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Tau, proteins significant in Alzheimer's disease. Fourteen of its interactors are known APP interactors, and two are Tau interactors, indicating GNPDA2's involvement in pathways related to neurodegeneration (LachénMontes2024Involvement). The protein's overexpression has been linked to changes in cell projection organization and primary cilia dysfunction, which are relevant to neurodegenerative processes (LachénMontes2024Involvement).

In addition, GNPDA2 is part of a protein-protein interaction network that includes proteins like FTO, NEGR1, GABRG1, and GPR139, suggesting its involvement in broader metabolic and regulatory pathways (Wang2022Identification).
