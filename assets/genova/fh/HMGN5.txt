# HMGN5

## Overview
HMGN5, or high mobility group nucleosome binding domain 5, is a gene that encodes a nuclear protein involved in the regulation of chromatin structure and function. The protein, also known as NSBP1, is a member of the high mobility group nucleosome-binding (HMGN) protein family and plays a critical role in modulating chromatin compaction and transcriptional activity. HMGN5 is characterized by its nucleosome binding domain (NBD) and a highly acidic C-terminal domain, which facilitate its interaction with chromatin and linker histones, such as histone H1, to counteract chromatin condensation. This interaction is essential for maintaining transcriptional fidelity and cellular differentiation. The protein's ability to influence chromatin architecture and gene expression has significant implications in various cellular processes, including transcription, replication, recombination, and repair. Alterations in HMGN5 expression have been linked to several cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Rochman2009The; Mou2022HMGN5; Malicet2011Distinct).

## Structure
The HMGN5 protein is a rapidly evolving nucleosome-binding protein with distinct structural features. It is characterized by a nuclear localization signal (NLS) encoded by exon I, a nucleosome binding domain (NBD) encoded by exons III and IV, and a long acidic tail in the C-terminal region encoded by exon VI (Malicet2011Distinct). The NBD includes a highly conserved 10-amino-acid sequence crucial for binding to nucleosome core particles (Malicet2011Distinct). The C-terminal region is highly variable in length and sequence, containing repetitive motifs and a high content of charged amino acids, influenced by retrotransposon sequences in exon VI (Malicet2011Distinct).

The protein is highly acidic, with a significant portion of its amino acids being negatively charged, which contributes to its interaction with chromatin (Rochman2009The). The C-terminal domain is crucial for targeting HMGN5 to euchromatin, where it interacts with linker histones and counteracts chromatin compaction (Rochman2009The). The C-terminal domain is predicted to be intrinsically disordered, facilitating its binding to other proteins (Rochman2009The). The human and mouse variants of HMGN5 differ notably in their C-terminal regions, with the mouse variant being longer and more acidic (Malicet2011Distinct).

## Function
HMGN5, also known as NSBP1, is a nuclear protein that plays a crucial role in modulating chromatin structure and function in healthy human cells. It is a member of the high mobility group nucleosome-binding (HMGN) protein family and is involved in the regulation of chromatin compaction and transcriptional activity. HMGN5 binds specifically to nucleosomes in euchromatin, where it counteracts the chromatin-condensing activity of linker histones such as histone H1, leading to chromatin decompaction and facilitating transcription (Rochman2009The; Malicet2011Distinct).

The protein's C-terminal domain is highly acidic and plays a significant role in its interaction with linker histones, reducing their residence time on chromatin and altering higher-order chromatin structure (Malicet2011Distinct). HMGN5's ability to modulate chromatin architecture is essential for maintaining transcriptional fidelity and cellular differentiation (Rochman2009The).

HMGN5 is also involved in the interaction with lamina-associated polypeptide 2α (LAP2α), suggesting a functional link between chromatin-binding and lamin-binding proteins, which is crucial for regulating nuclear architecture (Zhang2013High). Through these interactions, HMGN5 influences gene expression and plays a role in various cellular processes, including transcription, replication, recombination, and repair (Malicet2011Distinct).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the HMGN5 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In breast cancer, HMGN5 is critical for tumorigenesis and metastasis. Knockdown experiments in breast cancer cell lines have shown that reducing HMGN5 expression significantly decreases tumor growth and invasiveness. This is associated with the downregulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) proteins and reduced IL6/STAT3 signaling, a pathway known for its oncogenic role in breast cancer (Mou2022HMGN5). High HMGN5 expression is linked to poor prognosis in breast cancer patients, with higher levels correlating with shorter overall survival times (Mou2022HMGN5).

In meningiomas, HMGN5 knockdown suppresses cell invasion and enhances chemosensitivity to temozolomide, suggesting its role in tumor progression and resistance to chemotherapy (HE2015HMGN5). In urothelial bladder cancer, HMGN5 overexpression is associated with decreased chemosensitivity to cisplatin, and its knockdown enhances apoptosis and reduces cell viability by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway (Gan2017Knockdown).

HMGN5 is also upregulated in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, where its silencing reduces cell proliferation and chemoresistance, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Liu2017Silencing). These findings highlight the clinical significance of HMGN5 in cancer progression and treatment resistance.

## Interactions
HMGN5, also known as NSBP1, is a nucleosome-binding protein that interacts with chromatin to modulate its structure and function. It specifically binds to nucleosomes in euchromatin, counteracting the chromatin-condensing activity of linker histones such as histone H1 and its variant H5. This interaction is facilitated by the negatively charged C-terminal domain of HMGN5, which targets the positively charged C-terminal domain of these histones, reducing their ability to stabilize compact chromatin structures (Rochman2009The; Nizovtseva2019Opposite).

HMGN5 competes with histone H1 for chromatin binding sites, using its nucleosome binding domain (NBD) and C-terminal domain to interfere with H1's binding to the nucleosome. This competition results in transient chromatin decondensation, affecting chromatin architecture and transcription levels (Malicet2011Distinct; Rochman2010HMGN5NSBP1:).

HMGN5 also interacts with RNA, forming mutually exclusive complexes with either RNA or nucleosomes. It binds with similar affinity to both substrates, suggesting a role in regulating gene expression by switching between these interactions. HMGN5 is recruited to CTCF binding sites, indicating a potential role in chromatin organization and accessibility (Araya2022HMGN5).
