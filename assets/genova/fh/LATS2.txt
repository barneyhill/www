# LATS2

## Overview
LATS2 (large tumor suppressor kinase 2) is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase, which is a critical component of the Hippo signaling pathway. This pathway is essential for regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, and organ size, thereby playing a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis. The LATS2 protein is characterized by its conserved kinase domain and unique motifs that facilitate interactions with other proteins, such as YAP and TAZ, to modulate their activity. Through its involvement in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, genomic stability, and chromatin dynamics, LATS2 acts as a tumor suppressor. Its dysregulation is implicated in several cancers, highlighting its clinical significance as a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target (An2013Lats2; Furth2017The).

## Structure
The LATS2 protein is a serine/threonine kinase that is part of the AGC kinase subfamily, closely related to nuclear Dbf2-related kinases. It consists of several key domains, including a conserved kinase domain at the C-terminal end, which shares significant sequence similarity with LATS1, with 80% identity in the mouse homolog (Furth2017The; Yabuta2000Structure). The N-terminal region of LATS2 contains conserved sequences known as LATS conserved domain 1 (LCD1) and LATS conserved domain 2 (LCD2), which are crucial for its regulation and function (Yu2014Mutation). 

Unique features of the human LATS2 include a PAPA repeat and a PPxY motif, which are important for interactions with YAP, TAZ, and other components of the Hippo pathway (Furth2017The). LATS2 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by MST, MAP4Ks, and PKA, which influence its activity and interactions. Phosphorylation by CHK1/2 is linked to DNA damage-induced apoptosis (Furth2017The). The protein's stability is regulated by interactions with other proteins and ubiquitination processes, with KIBRA enhancing its stability and ubiquitination by E3 ligases like NEDD4 and SIAH2 leading to degradation (Furth2017The). 

LATS2 is predominantly a nuclear protein, as shown by immunoblot analysis (Yabuta2000Structure). The protein's structure and interactions are critical for its role in the Hippo signaling pathway, which regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis.

## Function
LATS2 (large tumor suppressor kinase 2) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in the Hippo signaling pathway, which is essential for regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, and organ size. In healthy human cells, LATS2 phosphorylates the transcriptional cofactors YAP and TAZ, leading to their retention in the cytoplasm and preventing them from activating the transcription factor TEAD in the nucleus. This action allows PPARc to regain its transcriptional activity, promoting adipocyte differentiation and contributing to a phenotype characterized by repressed proliferation and accelerated differentiation in adipocytes (An2013Lats2).

LATS2 also plays a significant role in maintaining genomic stability and mitotic fidelity. It acts at the G1/S checkpoint to modulate cell cycle progression by inhibiting the G1/S transition, thereby preventing excessive cell growth and tumorigenesis (Furth2017The; Li2003Lats2). LATS2's nuclear localization is crucial for its functions, such as potentiating the tumor suppressor p53 during mitotic or oncogenic stress and regulating chromatin dynamics (Furth2017The). It is involved in various physiological functions, including cell cycle regulation, differentiation, and motility, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis (Furth2017The).

## Clinical Significance
LATS2 (large tumor suppressor kinase 2) plays a significant role in various cancers due to its involvement in the Hippo signaling pathway, which regulates cell growth and apoptosis. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), LATS2 is often downregulated, correlating with advanced tumor classification, lymph node metastasis, and poor clinical outcomes. Lower LATS2 expression is associated with reduced survival rates, making it an independent prognostic factor for NSCLC patients (Wu2016LATS2).

In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), LATS2 is frequently overexpressed and demethylated, with high expression linked to poor prognosis. This overexpression promotes cell proliferation and is associated with lower survival rates, particularly in late-stage disease (Zhang2010LATS2).

In malignant mesothelioma (MM), LATS2 mutations, including homozygous deletions and point mutations, lead to its inactivation, contributing to uncontrolled cell proliferation. These mutations disrupt the Hippo pathway, resulting in the deregulation of cell growth (Murakami2011LATS2).

In lung adenocarcinoma, LATS2 expression levels are a significant prognostic factor, with lower expression correlating with poorer survival outcomes. LATS2 expression is often downregulated due to promoter hypermethylation or micro-RNA regulation (Luo2014Aberrant).

## Interactions
LATS2, a serine/threonine kinase, participates in various physical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, influencing multiple cellular processes. It interacts with components of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), such as EZH2 and SUZ12, on chromatin, where it phosphorylates these components to regulate PRC2 function (Torigata2016LATS2). LATS2 also disrupts the interaction between β-catenin and BCL9, inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin-mediated transcription, which is crucial for its role as a tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer (Li2013LATS2).

In the context of NF-κB signaling, LATS2 interacts with IKKβ, preventing its interaction with TAK1, thereby acting as a negative regulator of NF-κB activation (Yao2015LATS2). LATS2 also interacts with Mdm2, leading to the stabilization of p53, which is essential for p53-mediated transcription and tumor suppression (Aylon2006A). Additionally, LATS2 phosphorylates DYRK1A, promoting the assembly of the DREAM complex, which represses S-phase E2F target genes to promote senescence (Furth2017The). These interactions highlight LATS2's role in regulating cell cycle, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis.
