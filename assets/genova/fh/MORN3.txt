# MORN3

## Overview
MORN3 is a gene that encodes the protein MORN repeat containing 3, which is characterized by the presence of multiple MORN (Membrane Occupation and Recognition Nexus) motifs. These motifs are known for their role in protein-protein interactions and are implicated in various cellular processes. The MORN3 protein is involved in cellular signaling pathways and may play a role in the regulation of cellular growth and differentiation. Although the precise biological functions of MORN3 are not fully elucidated, it is believed to interact with other proteins within the cell, potentially influencing pathways such as the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway (Qiu2020aarFDC). Further research is needed to fully understand the clinical significance and potential implications of MORN3 in human health and disease.
