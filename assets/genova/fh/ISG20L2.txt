# ISG20L2

## Overview
ISG20L2 is a gene that encodes the protein interferon stimulated exonuclease gene 20 like 2, which is a nucleolar exonuclease belonging to the DEDDh subfamily of the DEDD 3'-5' exonuclease superfamily. This protein plays a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis and RNA processing, particularly in the maturation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) within the nucleolus (Couté2008ISG20L2; Ma2023Molecular). The ISG20L2 protein is characterized by its exonuclease activity, which is essential for the proper processing of precursor rRNAs, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and normal cell proliferation (Ma2023Molecular). Disruptions in its function can lead to nucleolar stress and have been implicated in various cancers, where it is often up-regulated, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target and prognostic marker (Ma2023Molecular; Zhang2024High).

## Structure
The ISG20L2 protein is a nucleolar exonuclease belonging to the DEDDh subfamily of the DEDD 3'-5' exonuclease superfamily. It consists of 353 amino acids with a theoretical molecular mass of 39 kDa and an isoelectric point of 9.9 (Couté2008ISG20L2). The primary structure includes an N-terminal disorder region (residues 1-177) and a C-terminal functional DEDD domain (residues 178-353), which is responsible for its exonuclease activity on RNAs (Ma2023Molecular). The exonuclease domain, located between amino acids 178 and 344, contains conserved motifs and important residues characteristic of the DEDDh group (Couté2008ISG20L2).

The secondary structure of ISG20L2 features a core five-stranded twisted β-sheet flanked by α-helices, forming a common αβα fold typical of DEDD 3'-5' exonucleases (Ma2023Molecular). The tertiary structure includes a catalytic pocket located in a hollow near the center of the protein, formed by residues from specific loops and helices (Ma2023Molecular). The quaternary structure of ISG20L2 includes two protein molecules in the asymmetric unit, with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.357 Å between them, indicating nearly identical structures (Ma2023Molecular). The protein's structure is crucial for its role in ribosome biogenesis and its involvement in cancer cell proliferation (Ma2023Molecular).

## Function
The ISG20L2 gene encodes a nucleolar exoribonuclease involved in ribosome biogenesis, crucial for cell growth and proliferation. In healthy human cells, ISG20L2 plays a significant role in the maturation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), specifically in processing the 18S and 5.8S precursor rRNAs. It functions as a 3' to 5' exonuclease, trimming the 18S-E pre-rRNA in the nucleus and working in conjunction with the DIS3 subunit of the exosome complex for 5.8S rRNA maturation (Couté2008ISG20L2; Ma2023Molecular). ISG20L2 is localized within the nucleoli, where it interacts with various ribosomal proteins and other proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis, such as nucleolin and nucleolar RNA helicase II (Couté2008ISG20L2).

The protein's exonuclease activity is essential for the proper processing of precursor rRNAs, maintaining the balance of ribosome biogenesis. Disruptions in ISG20L2 function can lead to nucleolar stress, potentially activating p53 and causing cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (Ma2023Molecular). ISG20L2's activity is crucial for normal cell proliferation and function, highlighting its importance in cellular homeostasis (Ma2023Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
The ISG20L2 gene is implicated in several cancers due to its role in ribosome biogenesis and cell proliferation. It is aberrantly up-regulated in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), suggesting its involvement in cancer progression (Ma2023Molecular). In colon cancer, ISG20L2 promotes cell growth, and its depletion leads to nucleolar stress, p53 activation, and cell cycle arrest, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Ma2023Molecular). In LUAD, high ISG20L2 expression is associated with increased tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis, making it a potential prognostic marker (Zhang2024High).

In multiple myeloma (MM), ISG20L2 contributes to resistance against proteasome inhibitors like bortezomib by competing with the proteasome subunit PSMB5 for binding, reducing the drug's efficacy (Yang2022ISG20L2). High ISG20L2 expression correlates with poorer overall survival in MM patients, highlighting its role as a prognostic marker and potential target for overcoming drug resistance (Yang2022ISG20L2). These findings underscore the clinical significance of ISG20L2 in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.

## Interactions
ISG20L2 is a nucleolar exoribonuclease involved in ribosome biogenesis and RNA processing. It interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in ribosomal RNA (rRNA) maturation. Co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analyses have identified ISG20L2's association with 30 different proteins, including those involved in ribosome biogenesis such as nucleolin, nucleolar RNA helicase II, B23, DNA topoisomerase I, DDX27, and KIAA0179 (Couté2008ISG20L2). ISG20L2 also interacts with 14 ribosomal proteins of the 60S subunit and four of the 40S subunit, indicating its involvement in ribosome assembly (Couté2008ISG20L2).

The protein is involved in mRNA metabolism, interacting with proteins such as hnRNP A1, hnRNP A2/B1, ASF/SF2, SRp20, and Tra2β, suggesting a role in mRNA splicing and nucleocytoplasmic export (Couté2008ISG20L2). ISG20L2's interactions with some partners are RNA-dependent, highlighting the importance of RNA integrity in these interactions (Couté2008ISG20L2). Structurally, ISG20L2 binds RNA through a conserved catalytic pocket, with key residues forming hydrogen bonds with RNA's 2' and 3'-OH groups and phosphate moieties, indicating non-sequence-specific interactions (Ma2023Molecular).
