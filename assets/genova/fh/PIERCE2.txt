# PIERCE2

## Overview
PIERCE2 is a gene that encodes the protein piercer of microtubule wall 2, which plays a crucial role in cellular processes involving microtubule dynamics. This protein is categorized as a microtubule-associated protein, and it is involved in the stabilization and regulation of microtubule structures within the cell. The piercer of microtubule wall 2 protein is essential for maintaining the integrity of the cytoskeleton, facilitating intracellular transport, and ensuring proper cell division. Its interactions with other proteins and cellular components are critical for the modulation of microtubule behavior, which is vital for various cellular functions and processes (Qiu2020aarFDC).
