# PRMT9

## Overview
PRMT9 is a gene that encodes the protein arginine methyltransferase 9, a type II methyltransferase enzyme involved in the post-translational modification of proteins through arginine methylation. This enzyme is characterized by its unique structural features, including an F-box domain, zinc finger motif, and a duplicated methyltransferase domain, which are essential for its specific substrate interactions and catalytic activity (Cook2006FBXO11PRMT9; Hadjikyriacou2015Unique). PRMT9 plays a critical role in RNA splicing by methylating the splicing factor SAP145, thereby facilitating the maturation of U2 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and ensuring the fidelity of pre-mRNA splicing (Yang2015PRMT9; Hadjikyriacou2015Unique). Additionally, PRMT9 is involved in modulating immune responses and has been implicated in various diseases, including viral infections and cancer, due to its regulatory functions in gene expression and immune signaling pathways (Yang2015PRMT9; Bai2022The).

## Structure
PRMT9 is a protein arginine methyltransferase characterized by several unique structural features. It contains an F-box domain at the amino terminus and a zinc finger motif at the carboxyl terminus, although some isoforms may lack these motifs (Cook2006FBXO11PRMT9). The core region of PRMT9 includes an AdoMet-binding domain and putative catalytic sites, which are essential for its methyltransferase activity (Cook2006FBXO11PRMT9). PRMT9 is predicted to exhibit a b-propeller domain fold, characterized by repeating polypeptide segments and a doughnut-shaped structure formed by alternating antiparallel b-pleated sheets (Cook2006FBXO11PRMT9).

PRMT9 also features three N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs), which are helical structures that facilitate protein-protein interactions (Yang2015PRMT9). The enzyme contains a duplicated methyltransferase domain, which is unusual among PRMTs and is necessary for its interaction with specific substrates like SF3B2 (Hadjikyriacou2015Unique). The presence of a double E loop motif, with crucial glutamate residues at positions 255 and 264, is important for substrate binding (Hadjikyriacou2015Unique).

PRMT9 can form homodimers in solution, similar to other PRMTs, to facilitate substrate methylation (Hadjikyriacou2015Unique). The enzyme is highly conserved among vertebrates and occasionally found in invertebrates, but it lacks orthologues in fungi or prokaryotes (Yang2015PRMT9).

## Function
PRMT9 (protein arginine methyltransferase 9) is a type II methyltransferase enzyme that plays a crucial role in the regulation of RNA splicing in healthy human cells. It specifically methylates the splicing factor SAP145, also known as SF3B2, at arginine 508, resulting in the formation of monomethylated arginine (MMA) and symmetrically dimethylated arginine (SDMA) (Yang2015PRMT9; Hadjikyriacou2015Unique). This methylation is essential for the interaction between SAP145 and the Survival of Motor Neuron (SMN) protein, facilitating the maturation of U2 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), which are critical components of the spliceosome involved in pre-mRNA splicing (Yang2015PRMT9).

PRMT9's activity is highly specific, as it does not methylate common substrates of other PRMTs, such as core histones or GAR motif-containing proteins (Yang2015PRMT9; Hadjikyriacou2015Unique). The enzyme is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it associates with SAP145 and SAP49 to form a complex that is crucial for the proper maturation and nuclear translocation of U2 snRNPs (Yang2015PRMT9; Hadjikyriacou2015Unique). This specificity and role in splicing suggest that PRMT9 is integral to maintaining the fidelity of RNA processing and gene expression regulation in human cells (Yang2015PRMT9; Hadjikyriacou2015Unique).

## Clinical Significance
PRMT9 has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in regulating immune responses and gene expression. Alterations in PRMT9 expression or function can significantly impact the body's ability to respond to viral infections. PRMT9 negatively regulates the innate antiviral response by inhibiting MAVS-mediated signaling pathways, which affects the production of IFN-β, a critical component of the antiviral immune response. Deficiency in PRMT9 enhances the antiviral response to RNA viruses, suggesting that changes in its expression could influence clinical outcomes in viral diseases (Bai2022The).

PRMT9 is also linked to various cancers, although its specific role in cancer development is not fully understood. The enzyme's involvement in methylating splicing factors like SAP145 suggests that alterations in PRMT9 could lead to splicing errors, potentially contributing to cancer progression (Yang2015PRMT9).

Additionally, PRMT9's regulation of MAVS through arginine methylation is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing autoimmune diseases. By inhibiting MAVS autoactivation in unstimulated cells, PRMT9 helps prevent excessive immune responses that could lead to autoimmune conditions (Bai2022The).

## Interactions
PRMT9 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It specifically interacts with the splicing factors SAP145 (also known as SF3B2) and SAP49 (SF3B4), forming a complex that is crucial for the maturation of U2 snRNP, a component of the spliceosome involved in RNA splicing (Yang2015PRMT9). PRMT9 methylates SAP145 at arginine 508, creating a binding site for the Tudor domain of the Survival of Motor Neuron (SMN) protein, which is essential for the assembly of the SMN-SAP145 complex (Yang2015PRMT9).

PRMT9 also interacts with the RNA splicing factor SF3B2, influencing alternative splicing of pre-mRNA. This interaction is characterized by PRMT9's ability to symmetrically dimethylate arginine residues on SF3B2, which is crucial for its function in splicing (Hadjikyriacou2015Unique).

In the context of antiviral immune responses, PRMT9 interacts with mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), inhibiting its activation through arginine methylation. This interaction modulates the MAVS-mediated signaling pathway, affecting the production of interferon-beta (IFN-β) and the innate immune response against RNA viruses (Bai2022The). 

PRMT9 also interacts with HSPA8, a protein involved in inhibiting ferroptosis, thereby influencing hepatocellular carcinoma progression. This interaction involves the methylation of HSPA8, affecting its stability and function (Deng2023Arginine).
