# SIGLEC15

## Overview
SIGLEC15 is a gene that encodes the protein sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin 15 (Siglec-15), which is a member of the Siglec family of proteins. These proteins are characterized by their ability to bind sialic acids, which are commonly found on the surface of cells and play a crucial role in cell-cell interactions and signaling. Siglec-15 is a transmembrane protein that is primarily involved in immune modulation and bone remodeling. It is expressed on certain myeloid cells, including macrophages, and is involved in the regulation of osteoclast differentiation and function, as well as in the modulation of immune responses. The protein interacts with various ligands and adaptor proteins, such as DAP12, to mediate its effects on immune cells and osteoclasts. Due to its role in immune regulation and bone homeostasis, SIGLEC15 has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and bone disorders, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Wang2019Siglec-15; Takamiya2012The; Kameda2013Siglec-15).

## Structure
Siglec-15 is a sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin that plays a role in immune modulation and osteoclast function. The protein consists of an extracellular domain with two immunoglobulin (Ig) domains: a variable (V)-set domain and a constant 2 (C2)-set domain. The V-set domain is characterized by a sandwich of two β-pleated sheets consisting of antiparallel β-strands, and it includes a unique extra β-strand, termed C′′, which contributes to an extended surface area on the Ig domain (Lenza2023Abstract). 

The V-set domain contains a conserved arginine residue (R143) that forms a salt bridge with sialic acid, which is crucial for its ligand-binding capability (Lenza2023Abstract). This domain is responsible for recognizing sialic acids on glycoproteins such as CD11b/CD18 integrins on T cells, with glycosylation playing a significant role in these interactions (Lenza2023Abstract).

Siglec-15 is subject to post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which is essential for its interaction with other proteins and its function in immune modulation (Lenza2023Abstract). The protein also interacts with adapter proteins like DAP12 through its transmembrane region, which contains a lysine residue facilitating this interaction (Stuible2014Mechanism).

## Function
Siglec-15 is a member of the sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs) family, which are involved in immune regulation. In healthy human cells, Siglec-15 is primarily expressed on certain myeloid cells, including macrophages, and plays a role in modulating immune responses. It is minimally expressed in most normal tissues but is present in macrophages, where it can suppress T-cell activity (Wang2019Siglec-15).

Siglec-15 is involved in osteoclast differentiation and bone remodeling by modulating receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) signaling. This modulation occurs through its association with DNAX-activating protein 12kDa (DAP12), an adaptor protein with an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM). In Siglec-15 deficient mice, there is a mild osteopetrosis phenotype due to impaired osteoclast development, indicating its essential role in bone remodeling (Kameda2013Siglec-15).

Siglec-15 also interacts with the sialyl-Tn antigen, a tumor-associated glycan structure, and is involved in the functional regulation of macrophages within tumors. This interaction enhances the secretion of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) from macrophages, contributing to tumor progression by modulating the tumor microenvironment (Takamiya2012The).

## Clinical Significance
SIGLEC15 has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in immune regulation and bone remodeling. In cancer, SIGLEC15 is often overexpressed and contributes to immune evasion by suppressing CD8+ T-cell responses and promoting an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. This overexpression is observed in several cancer types, including breast cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, esophageal cancer, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and thyroid cancer, where it is associated with more aggressive disease features (Hou2022Unveiling; Jiang2022The). In lung adenocarcinoma, high SIGLEC15 expression is linked to unfavorable progression-free survival, suggesting its role in cancer progression (Li2020Expression).

In recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC), SIGLEC15 has been identified as a susceptibility factor. Genetic variations, such as the polymorphism rs2919643, are associated with increased immune response and inflammation, contributing to the pathology of RVVC (Jaeger2019A). SIGLEC15's role in osteoclast differentiation also links it to bone disorders. Its deficiency in mice leads to mild osteopetrosis due to impaired osteoclast development and function, highlighting its importance in bone resorption (Kameda2013Siglec-15). These findings suggest that SIGLEC15 is a potential therapeutic target in both cancer and bone diseases (Sun2021Siglec-15).

## Interactions
Siglec-15 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in immune regulation and bone homeostasis. It is known to interact with the integrin CD11b on T cells, a process that is dependent on glycosylation. This interaction is crucial for Siglec-15's role in modulating T cell activity, as demonstrated by blocking assays that show reduced binding when CD11b is inhibited (Lenza2023Abstract). 

Siglec-15 also forms a complex with the adaptor protein DAP12, which contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM). This interaction is essential for the regulation of osteoclast differentiation and function, as it modulates RANKL-induced signaling pathways, including PI3K/Akt and Erk pathways (Kameda2013Siglec-15). The interaction between Siglec-15 and DAP12 is also involved in the secretion of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) from monocytes/macrophages through the DAP12-Syk signaling pathway, which is crucial for modifying the tumor microenvironment (Takamiya2012The). 

These interactions highlight Siglec-15's role in immune modulation and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer and bone-related diseases.
