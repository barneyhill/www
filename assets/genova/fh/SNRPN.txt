# SNRPN

## Overview
The SNRPN gene encodes the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N (SmN), a critical component of the spliceosomal complex involved in pre-mRNA processing. As a member of the U small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), SmN plays a pivotal role in RNA splicing, which is essential for the regulation of gene expression during development (Gray1999An; Tycko2002Physiological). The SNRPN gene is expressed in a tissue-specific manner, with particularly high levels in the brain and heart, indicating its significant role in alternative splicing events, especially in neuronal tissues (Lee2014Modulation). Additionally, SNRPN is part of a bicistronic transcript that includes SNURF and is involved in the cis regulation of imprinting across the 15q11-q13 region, which is crucial for normal development (Gray1999An). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its association with neurodevelopmental disorders such as Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome, where imprinting mutations in the 15q11-q13 region can lead to these conditions (White2006Quantitative; Ohta1999ImprintingMutation).

## Function
The SNRPN gene encodes the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N (SmN), which is a component of the spliceosomal complex involved in pre-mRNA processing. SmN is part of the U snRNPs, which play a crucial role in RNA splicing by participating in the assembly and function of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) (Tycko2002Physiological). In healthy human cells, SNRPN is translated into the SmN spliceosomal protein, which is involved in RNA splicing and is essential for the regulation of gene expression during development (Gray1999An).

The SNRPN gene is expressed in a tissue-specific manner, with high levels in the brain and heart, where it replaces the ubiquitously expressed snRNP polypeptide B (SmB)/B0 in the Sm core assembly of snRNPs (Lee2014Modulation). This expression pattern suggests a significant role in alternative splicing events, particularly in neuronal tissues where many such events occur (Lee2014Modulation). The SNRPN gene is part of a bicistronic transcript that also includes SNURF, and it is involved in the cis regulation of imprinting across the 15q11-q13 region, which is crucial for normal development (Gray1999An).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SNRPN gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders, most notably Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS). These conditions are linked to imprinting mutations in the 15q11-q13 region of chromosome 15, where SNRPN is located. In PWS, the absence of paternally expressed genes, including SNRPN, leads to symptoms such as hypotonia, developmental delays, and obesity. The SNRPN gene's promoter region contains critical imprint control elements necessary for imprint switching during spermatogenesis, and disruptions in this process can result in PWS (Ohta1999ImprintingMutation).

In AS, the loss of function of the maternally inherited UBE3A gene, which is regulated by the same imprinting center as SNRPN, is a primary cause. The SNRPN gene's methylation status is crucial for diagnosing both PWS and AS, as it reflects the differential methylation patterns of the maternal and paternal alleles (White2006Quantitative).

Additionally, SNRPN is implicated in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and intellectual disabilities. Abnormal expression of SNRPN affects neuronal morphology and spine development, which can lead to developmental delays and autistic behavior (Li2016The). The gene's interaction with the nuclear receptor Nr4a1 is significant in these contexts, as it regulates cortical and spine development (Li2016The).

## Interactions
The SNRPN gene encodes a protein that is involved in several critical interactions within the cell, particularly in the context of neuronal development. SNRPN interacts with N-acetylglucosamine kinase (NAGK) and dynein light chain roadblock-type 1 (DYNLRB1), playing a significant role in axodendritic branching through dynein-mediated microtubule transport (Timalsina2023NAcetylglucosamine). The interaction between SNRPN and DYNLRB1 is a novel finding, highlighting its importance in retrograde cargo transport in neurons (Timalsina2023NAcetylglucosamine).

SNRPN also interacts with neurochondrin (NCDN) and survival motor neuron (SMN) protein, suggesting a role in protein localization, cell polarity, and vesicle trafficking (Timalsina2023NAcetylglucosamine). In the context of the spliceosome, SNRPN is a component involved in pre-mRNA splicing, interacting with Sm proteins and small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) such as U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 (Li2016The). These interactions are crucial for RNA splicing and gene expression regulation.

The study of SNRPN interactions is particularly relevant in understanding neurodevelopmental disorders such as Prader-Willi syndrome, where disruptions in these interactions could have significant implications (Timalsina2023NAcetylglucosamine).
