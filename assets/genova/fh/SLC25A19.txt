# SLC25A19

## Overview
The SLC25A19 gene encodes the mitochondrial transporter protein known as solute carrier family 25 member 19, which is a crucial component of the mitochondrial carrier family (MCF). This protein is characterized by its transmembrane structure, consisting of six alpha-helices that facilitate the transport of thiamine pyrophosphate (ThPP) into mitochondria. ThPP is an essential cofactor for key enzymatic complexes involved in energy metabolism, such as pyruvate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. The proper functioning of SLC25A19 is vital for maintaining cellular energy homeostasis, particularly in tissues with high energy demands. Mutations in this gene can lead to severe metabolic disorders, including Amish microcephaly and neuropathy with bilateral striatal necrosis, underscoring its critical role in mitochondrial function and energy production (Palmieri2013The; Spiegel2009SLC25A19; Lindhurst2006Knockout).

## Structure
The SLC25A19 gene encodes a protein that is part of the mitochondrial carrier family (MCF), characterized by a tripartite structure with three tandemly repeated homologous domains, each approximately 100 amino acids in length. Each domain contains two transmembrane alpha-helices, resulting in a total of six transmembrane helices for the protein. These helices are linked by a signature motif sequence, PX[D/E]XX[K/R]X[K/R], which is crucial for the transport function (Palmieri2014Mitochondrial; Palmieri2013The).

The protein's structure includes a funnel-shaped cavity open towards the cytosol, with a salt-bridge network that closes the cavity on the matrix side. This network is formed by charged residues within the signature motifs, acting as gates on both the cytosolic and matrix sides. The transport mechanism involves conformational changes facilitated by prolines and glycines acting as hinges, allowing the protein to transition between different states during substrate transport (Palmieri2014Mitochondrial).

Mutations in SLC25A19, such as the p.Gly177Ala mutation, affect highly conserved residues and can significantly reduce transport activity, leading to severe disorders like Amish microcephaly (Palmieri2020Diseases; Palmieri2013The).

## Function
The SLC25A19 gene encodes a mitochondrial transporter protein responsible for the transport of thiamine pyrophosphate (ThPP) into mitochondria. ThPP is a crucial cofactor for several enzyme complexes, including pyruvate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, which are essential for energy metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation in cells (Palmieri2013The; Lindhurst2006Knockout). The proper function of SLC25A19 ensures adequate mitochondrial ThPP levels, supporting the activity of these ThPP-dependent enzymes and maintaining normal metabolic processes (Palmieri2014Mitochondrial).

In healthy human cells, SLC25A19 plays a vital role in cellular energy homeostasis by facilitating the uptake of ThPP, which is necessary for the normal function of mitochondrial enzymes involved in carbohydrate and energy metabolism (Nabokina2013Characterization). The gene is expressed ubiquitously, with particularly high levels in tissues with significant energy demands, such as the kidney and lung (Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological).

Mutations in SLC25A19 can lead to severe metabolic disorders, such as Amish microcephaly, due to impaired ThPP transport and reduced activity of ThPP-dependent enzymes, highlighting the gene's critical role in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production (Palmieri2013The; Lindhurst2006Knockout).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC25A19 gene are associated with several severe disorders. One of the most notable conditions is Amish lethal microcephaly, characterized by severe congenital microcephaly, developmental delay, and early death, typically within the first year of life. This condition is prevalent in the Amish community and is linked to the homozygous c.530G>C mutation, which results in the p.G177A substitution, leading to a significant reduction in the transport activity of the mitochondrial thiamine pyrophosphate carrier (Palmieri2014Mitochondrial; Porta2020SLC25A19; Lindhurst2006Knockout).

Another condition associated with SLC25A19 mutations is neuropathy with bilateral striatal necrosis. This disorder presents with symptoms such as recurrent episodes of flaccid paralysis, encephalopathy, and chronic progressive polyneuropathy. It is linked to different mutations, such as c.373G>A, which results in the Gly125Ser substitution (Spiegel2009SLC25A19).

Thiamine metabolism dysfunction syndrome 4 is another condition linked to SLC25A19 mutations. It is characterized by acute episodes of encephalopathy, often triggered by febrile illnesses, and is associated with various mutations, including compound heterozygous variants (Chen2021Identification). Thiamine supplementation has shown some efficacy in managing symptoms in these conditions (Marcé‐Grau2019Genetic).
