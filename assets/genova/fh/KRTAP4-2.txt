# KRTAP4-2

## Overview
KRTAP4-2 is a gene that encodes the keratin-associated protein 4-2, which plays a crucial role in the structural composition of hair fibers. This protein is part of the keratin-associated protein family, known for their involvement in the formation and maintenance of hair and other keratinized tissues. The protein is characterized by a high cysteine content, which facilitates the formation of disulfide bonds, contributing to its stability and function within hair fibers (Perdigão2019Dark). KRTAP4-2 interacts with keratin intermediate filaments, forming multimeric receptor complexes that are essential for the mechanical properties and integrity of hair (Zhou2021The). While primarily associated with hair structure, alterations in KRTAP4-2 expression have been linked to various clinical contexts, including potential implications in tumor characteristics and hair pigmentation (Samuelov2015The; Wang2022DUSP5).

## Structure
KRTAP4-2, a keratin-associated protein, is characterized by its involvement in the structural composition of hair fibers. The primary structure of KRTAP4-2 is noted for its atypical amino acid composition, which includes a high cysteine content that facilitates the formation of disulfide bonds, crucial for the protein's stability and function (Perdigão2019Dark). The secondary structure of KRTAP4-2 likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, common in keratin-associated proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context. 

The tertiary structure is stabilized by these disulfide bonds, contributing to the protein's robustness and its role in hair fiber properties (Zhou2021The). KRTAP4-2 is part of multimeric receptor complexes, suggesting a quaternary structure that involves interactions with keratin intermediate filaments, which are essential for maintaining the integrity and mechanical properties of hair fibers (Perdigão2019Dark). 

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may alter the structural conformation and interactions of KRTAP4-2, impacting its function in hair fiber properties (Zhou2021The). These structural features underscore the protein's role in cellular signaling and structural integrity within hair and possibly other keratinized tissues.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
KRTAP4-2, a member of the keratin-associated protein family, has been implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly concerning hair structure and growth. Mutations in KRTAP4-2 have been identified in mature cystic teratomas of the ovary, suggesting a potential role in the characteristics of these tumors. These mutations involve changes in protein coding, although specific diseases directly resulting from these mutations have not been detailed (Wang2022DUSP5).

Alterations in the expression of KRTAP4-2 have been observed in the context of hair follicle biology. The downregulation of KRTAP4-2, as a result of P-cadherin silencing, is associated with reduced melanogenesis and tyrosinase activity in hair follicles, potentially affecting hair pigmentation (Samuelov2015The). However, in studies examining the impact of a high-fat diet on keratin-associated proteins in mice, KRTAP4-2 expression did not show significant changes, indicating a possible resistance to dietary influences in certain tissues (Nakatani2024Downregulation).

While KRTAP4-2 is located in a genomic region associated with structural integrity in epithelial cells, its specific clinical significance in conditions like pancreatic adenocarcinoma remains unclear, as the focus has been more on regional amplification rather than direct gene involvement (Nowak2005Genomewide).
