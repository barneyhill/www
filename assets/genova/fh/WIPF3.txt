# WIPF3

## Overview
WIPF3, or WAS/WASL interacting protein family member 3, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, a critical component for maintaining cell shape, motility, and signaling. The protein encoded by WIPF3 is categorized as a cytoskeletal regulatory protein, playing a pivotal role in actin polymerization and stabilization, particularly in specialized cells such as podocytes in the kidney filtration barrier (De2023Identification). WIPF3 interacts with N-WASP, a key player in actin nucleation, and is regulated by the small GTPase Cdc42, facilitating dynamic actin remodeling necessary for cellular processes like movement and structural integrity (De2023Identification). Additionally, WIPF3 is implicated in protein-protein interactions that influence cytoskeletal organization and may have roles in spermatogenesis and immune cell regulation, highlighting its potential involvement in cancer metastasis and immune responses (Rafi2020The; Yao2023GenomeWide).

## Function
WIPF3, also known as WAS/WASL interacting protein family member 3, plays a significant role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which is crucial for maintaining cell shape, motility, and signaling. In human podocytes, WIPF3 forms a complex with N-WASP, a protein involved in actin nucleation, and is regulated by Cdc42. This interaction facilitates actin polymerization, which is essential for the structural integrity and function of podocytes, specialized cells in the kidney filtration barrier (De2023Identification).

WIPF3 is known to stabilize N-WASP by protecting it from degradation, as evidenced by knockout studies in mice where WIPF3 depletion led to reduced N-WASP protein levels. Conversely, overexpression of WIPF3 in human podocytes increases N-WASP levels, indicating its stabilizing effect (De2023Identification). This stabilization is vital for maintaining the cytoskeletal architecture of podocytes, which is necessary for their role in the renal filtration barrier (De2023Identification).

WIPF3 is also involved in cell movement and structure, as demonstrated by wound healing assays and measurements of filamentous actin, suggesting its role in cytoskeletal dynamics and cell motility (De2023Identification). The protein is active in the cytoplasm, particularly in areas requiring dynamic actin remodeling (De2023Identification).

## Interactions
WIPF3, also known as WAS/WASL-interacting protein family member 3, is involved in protein-protein interactions that are crucial for cytoskeletal organization. It is noted as a potential regulator of cytoskeletal organization and may have a role in spermatogenesis (Rafi2020The). WIPF3 is significantly up-regulated in metastatic osteosarcoma tissues and is associated with RAS-related immune cells. It regulates alternative splicing events, such as BSCL2, which is positively correlated with plasma cells, suggesting that WIPF3 may influence immune cell composition by regulating gene alternative splicing (Yao2023GenomeWide). 

WIPF3's interactions are part of a STRING Protein-Protein Interaction Network, which helps understand the functional associations between proteins. In this network, nodes represent proteins, and edges represent protein-protein associations that contribute to shared functions (Rafi2020The). These interactions highlight WIPF3's role in cellular processes such as movement, signaling, and immune responses, facilitated by its involvement in multiprotein complexes that regulate cytoskeletal rearrangements. The up-regulation of WIPF3 in certain cancer tissues and its association with immune cells underscore its potential role in cancer metastasis and immune regulation (Yao2023GenomeWide).
