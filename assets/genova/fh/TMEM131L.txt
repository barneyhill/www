# TMEM131L

## Overview
TMEM131L is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 131-like, which is involved in various cellular processes. As a transmembrane protein, it plays a crucial role in cellular signaling and communication across the cell membrane. The protein is implicated in several biological pathways, including those related to immune response and cellular proliferation. Research has shown that TMEM131L is associated with significant clinical outcomes in diseases such as gliomas and type 1 diabetes, where its expression levels can influence disease progression and patient prognosis (Shan2023Prognostic; Hebbar2023Linkage). Additionally, TMEM131L is involved in the regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway, which is critical for various developmental and disease processes (Hebbar2023Linkage).

## Clinical Significance
The TMEM131L gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to mutations or alterations in its expression. In gliomas, particularly glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and lower-grade gliomas (LGG), high expression of TMEM131L is associated with poor prognosis. This includes correlations with overall survival, disease-specific survival, and progression-free intervals in glioma patients. The gene's expression is linked to oxidative stress and immune infiltration, influencing glioma development through these pathways (Shan2023Prognostic).

TMEM131L has also been associated with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in Kuwaiti families. Genetic studies have identified TMEM131L as a candidate gene involved in T1D, with specific variants like rs6848033 being significantly associated with insulin sensitivity and related metabolic conditions. These findings suggest a potential role for TMEM131L in the pathogenesis of T1D, particularly concerning insulin-related traits and renal complications (Hebbar2023Linkage).

Additionally, TMEM131L is involved in regulating the Wnt signaling and thymocyte proliferation pathways, which are implicated in various renal diseases, including diabetic nephropathy and renal cancer (Hebbar2023Linkage). These associations highlight the gene's potential impact on multiple disease mechanisms.
