# POTEF

## Overview
POTEF is a gene that encodes the protein POTE ankyrin domain family member F, which is part of the POTE gene family. This family is characterized by its involvement in protein-protein interactions and structural stability, primarily due to the presence of ankyrin repeats and a spectrin-like domain. The POTEF protein is implicated in various biological processes, including human folliculogenesis, where it regulates the proliferation of granulosa cells, thereby influencing follicle development. It interacts with the chaperonin containing TCP-1 complex (CCT), affecting cell proliferation and potentially playing a role in ovarian autoimmunity. The gene's expression is developmentally regulated, being present in early-stage ovarian follicles, which suggests its involvement in the regulation of ovulation in primates (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary; Kasahara2021Primatespecific).

## Structure
The POTEF protein is a member of the POTE gene family, characterized by a conserved structure that includes several distinct domains. The primary structure of POTEF includes an N-terminal cysteine-rich region, which is followed by five to seven ankyrin repeats. These ankyrin repeats are composed of tandemly repeated modules of approximately 33 amino acids each, which are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). The protein also features a C-terminal spectrin-like domain, which is predicted to be mainly α-helical, suggesting a role in structural stability and interaction with cell membranes (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary).

POTEF contains a full long inverted repeat (LIR) sequence, which may influence its expression variation (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). Additionally, the protein includes a β-actin retrogene insertion that is in-frame, resulting in an actin module within the protein, which could contribute to its functional properties (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). The presence of these domains and structural features indicates that POTEF is involved in complex protein-protein and cell membrane interactions, potentially playing a role in cancer and germline tissues where it is expressed. The evolutionary dynamics of the POTE gene family, including POTEF, involve gene duplications and LINE transpositions, contributing to its current structure and function (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary).

## Function
The POTEF gene, a member of the POTE ankyrin domain family, plays a significant role in human folliculogenesis by regulating the proliferation of granulosa cells (GCs). In healthy human cells, POTEF expression is known to suppress the proliferation of these cells without inducing apoptosis, suggesting a role in arresting GC growth within primary follicles. This regulation is crucial for normal follicle development and may impact human folliculogenesis (Kasahara2021Primatespecific).

POTEF interacts with the chaperonin containing TCP-1 complex (CCT), specifically with subunits TCP-1α and TCP-1θ, through its actin domain. This interaction is believed to block the role of CCT in cell proliferation, indicating a regulatory function of POTEF in cell growth (Kasahara2021Primatespecific). The CCT complex is involved in the folding of cytoskeletal proteins, which are essential for cell proliferation and structural integrity (Kasahara2021Primatespecific).

POTEF's expression varies with the developmental stage of ovarian follicles, being present in primordial and primary follicles but absent in secondary and small antral follicles. This pattern suggests that POTEF is involved in early follicle development and may contribute to the regulation of single ovulation in primates (Kasahara2021Primatespecific).

## Interactions
POTEF interacts with several proteins, particularly within the context of human folliculogenesis and immune cell function. In granulosa cells, POTEF interacts with the chaperonin containing TCP-1 (CCT) complex, specifically binding to the TCP-1α and TCP-1θ subunits through its actin domain. This interaction is thought to inhibit cell proliferation by altering the function of the CCT complex, which is crucial for protein folding and cell growth (Kasahara2021Primatespecific).

POTEF's interaction with the CCT complex also affects the localization of its components, such as TCP-1α, which migrates closer to the cell membrane when POTEF is expressed. This suggests a role in modulating the cellular environment and potentially influencing receptor localization for growth signals (Kasahara2021Primatespecific).

In the context of ovarian autoimmunity and primary ovarian insufficiency, POTEF has been identified as a candidate autoantigen, interacting with autoantibodies in patients with these conditions (Kasahara2021Primatespecific).

These interactions highlight POTEF's role in regulating cell proliferation and its potential involvement in autoimmune responses, suggesting its importance in both normal cellular function and disease states.
