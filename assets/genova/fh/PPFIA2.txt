# PPFIA2

## Overview
PPFIA2 is a gene that encodes the protein liprin-α-2, which is a member of the liprin protein family. Liprin-α-2 is a synaptic protein that plays a critical role in neuronal development and synaptic function. It is predominantly expressed in neurons and oligodendrocytes, with significant localization in the hippocampus, particularly in synaptic regions such as mossy fiber endings. As a scaffolding protein, liprin-α-2 is involved in organizing synaptic vesicles and neurotransmitter receptors, thereby facilitating synaptic transmission and contributing to the regulation of synapse density and axon guidance. The protein interacts with various synaptic proteins, forming complexes that are essential for presynaptic organization and neurotransmitter release. Additionally, liprin-α-2 is implicated in intracellular transport processes, interacting with motor proteins to ensure proper localization and function of synaptic components (Spangler2007Liprinα; He2019Liprin).

## Function
The PPFIA2 gene encodes the liprin-α-2 protein, which plays a crucial role in neuronal function. Liprin-α-2 is highly expressed in neurons and oligodendrocytes and is predominantly localized in the hippocampus, particularly in mossy fiber endings in the CA3 region, synapses, axons, dendrites, and the cell body (He2019Liprin; Spangler2011Differential). It is involved in axon guidance and contributes to the normal density and growth of excitatory synapses and dendritic spines in hippocampal neurons (He2019Liprin).

Liprin-α-2 is essential for organizing synaptic vesicles and neurotransmitter receptors, facilitating synaptic transmission. It forms complexes with other synaptic proteins, such as CAST, RIM, and MALS-CASK-Mint1, which are linked to presynaptic neurotransmitter release and vesicle cycling (Spangler2007Liprinα). Liprin-α-2 also interacts with postsynaptic proteins like GRIP1 and LAR, influencing AMPAR clustering and dendritic spine morphology (Spangler2007Liprinα).

In the synapse active zone, liprin-α-2 organizes pre- and postsynaptic vesicle preparation and neurotransmitter function, playing a role in dendrite development, long-term depression (LTD), and neuropsychological function (He2019Liprin). It is involved in intracellular transport, interacting with kinesin motor proteins to facilitate the movement of synaptic vesicle proteins, crucial for proper localization and function (Spangler2007Liprinα).

## Clinical Significance
PPFIA2 has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in synaptic function and ocular development. Alterations in PPFIA2 expression have been associated with high-grade myopia, a condition characterized by excessive elongation of the eye, leading to severe nearsightedness. Studies have shown that PPFIA2 is differentially expressed in fetal versus adult ocular tissues, with higher expression in the fetal retina and choroid, suggesting its involvement in ocular growth regulation. Mutations or changes in the expression of PPFIA2 may disrupt normal signaling in the retina, contributing to the rapid ocular growth observed in myopia (Hawthorne2013Association).

In the context of neuropsychological function, PPFIA2 expression is significantly higher in heavy cannabis users compared to non-users. This upregulation is associated with lower estimated IQ in cannabis-naïve individuals, indicating a potential link between PPFIA2 expression and cognitive function independent of cannabis use. The gene's expression is influenced by cannabidiol (CBD), which increases PPFIA2 levels in monocytes, suggesting that cannabis use may affect neuropsychological outcomes through alterations in PPFIA2 expression (He2019Liprin).

PPFIA2 has also been identified as a significantly upregulated gene in prostate cancer tissues, indicating its potential role in cancer progression. Its expression is notably higher in prostate tumors compared to benign tissues, suggesting that PPFIA2 may contribute to the development and progression of prostate cancer (Chen2011Analysis).

## Interactions
PPFIA2, also known as liprin-α2, is a member of the liprin protein family, which plays a significant role in synaptic function and neuronal development. PPFIA2 interacts with several proteins through its coiled coil and SAM domains, which are crucial for synapse assembly and presynaptic organization. It binds to proteins such as MALS, CASK, RIM1, ERC1/ELKS, KIF1A, GRIP, and GIT1, organizing presynaptic active zones and regulating neurotransmitter release (Pehkonen2021Liprins). 

In the context of synaptic function, PPFIA2 is involved in guiding synaptic vesicles to their fusion sites and regulating neurotransmitter release, particularly at excitatory synapses like the hippocampal mossy fiber nerve endings (Hawthorne2013Association). The protein is also implicated in axon guidance and synapse density, interacting with muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR) and participating in mAChR-dependent long-term depression in the hippocampus (He2019Liprin).

PPFIA2's interactions extend to its role in forming biomolecular condensates through liquid-liquid phase separation, which is significant in cancer and small molecule therapeutics (Pehkonen2021Liprins). These interactions highlight PPFIA2's multifaceted role in cellular signaling and synaptic organization.
