# CCDC120

## Overview
CCDC120 is a gene that encodes the protein coiled-coil domain containing 120, which plays a significant role in the assembly and function of centriole subdistal appendages (SDAs) within the centrosome. This protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domains, which facilitate interactions with other centrosomal proteins such as hNinein and CEP170, crucial for microtubule anchoring and organization during the cell cycle (Huang2017Hierarchical). Although CCDC120 lacks catalytic activity, it functions as a scaffold protein, contributing to the hierarchical assembly of SDA components and indirectly influencing microtubule nucleation and stability (Torii2015A; Huang2017Hierarchical). The protein's interactions and post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, are essential for its stability and function, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular architecture (Torii2015A).

## Structure
CCDC120 is a protein composed of 630 amino acids, featuring two short coiled-coil domains in its N terminus and a long proline-rich domain in its C terminus (Huang2017Hierarchical). The coiled-coil domains are crucial for its interaction with other proteins, such as hNinein and CEP170. The first coiled-coil domain (1-90 amino acids) binds to the C terminus of CEP170, while the second coiled-coil domain (91-320 amino acids) interacts with the N terminus of hNinein (Huang2017Hierarchical). These interactions facilitate the protein's role in centrosome binding and the assembly of subdistal appendages (SDAs) (Huang2017Hierarchical).

CCDC120 does not contain a catalytic domain or structurally conserved protein domain beyond the coiled-coil domains (Torii2015A). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination have been noted, which may regulate its transport and stability. Phosphorylation by Akt and ubiquitination can lead to degradation unless CCDC120 forms a complex with cytohesin-2 (Torii2015A). The protein's structure and interactions suggest it acts as a scaffold, facilitating the assembly and function of centrosome components. There is no detailed information on the primary, tertiary, or quaternary structure, nor on splice variant isoforms.

## Function
CCDC120 is a protein involved in the assembly of centriole subdistal appendages (SDAs) and plays a crucial role in microtubule anchoring at the centrosome in interphase cells. It is localized at the centrosome, specifically at the SDAs of mother centrioles and the proximal ends of both centrioles during the cell cycle, with its localization pattern changing from the G1 to the G2 phase (Huang2017Hierarchical). CCDC120 interacts with other centrosome proteins such as hNinein and CEP170, facilitating their recruitment to the centrosomes through distinct coiled-coil domains (Huang2017Hierarchical). This interaction is essential for the hierarchical assembly of SDA components, which is critical for proper microtubule organization and anchoring (Huang2017Hierarchical).

The protein is recruited to SDAs by ODF2 and forms a ring-like structure at the distal part of centrioles, contributing to the maintenance of cellular architecture (Huang2017Hierarchical). Although CCDC120 does not directly bind microtubules, it may regulate microtubule organization indirectly through its interactions with hNinein and CEP170 (Huang2017Hierarchical). CCDC120 is also involved in microtubule nucleation processing, affecting microtubule nucleation at the early stage of regrowth (Huang2017Hierarchical).

## Interactions
CCDC120 is a protein involved in the assembly of centriole subdistal appendages (SDAs) and interacts with several other proteins crucial for this process. It interacts directly with hNinein and CEP170 through its N-terminal coiled-coil domains. The first coiled-coil domain (1-90 amino acids) of CCDC120 binds to the C terminus of CEP170 (1,015-1,460 amino acids), while the second coiled-coil domain (91-320 amino acids) interacts with the N terminus of hNinein (1-480 amino acids) (Huang2017Hierarchical). These interactions are essential for the recruitment and localization of hNinein and CEP170 to SDAs, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid assays (Huang2017Hierarchical).

CCDC120 is recruited to SDAs by ODF2, although the interaction appears to be indirect, with the first 100 amino acids of ODF2 required for binding (Huang2017Hierarchical). CCDC120 also competes with CCDC68 in recruiting CEP170, indicating independent functions in SDA assembly (Huang2017Hierarchical). Additionally, CCDC120 was identified as an interactor of lamin A in a yeast two-hybrid screen, suggesting a potential role in nuclear processes (Dittmer2014Systematic).
