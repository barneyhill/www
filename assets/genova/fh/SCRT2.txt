# SCRT2

## Overview
SCRT2 is a gene that encodes the protein scratch family transcriptional repressor 2, a member of the Snail superfamily of zinc-finger transcription factors. This protein is characterized by its modular structure, which includes a SNAG domain, a HINGE domain, and multiple zinc-finger domains, all of which contribute to its function as a transcriptional repressor (Paul2012Scratch2; Nakamura2018Functional). SCRT2 plays a pivotal role in neural development by regulating gene expression during neurogenesis, ensuring the maintenance of the postmitotic state of neurons and promoting neuronal survival by repressing pro-apoptotic factors (RodríguezAznar2013Scratch2; Goes2020Scratch2). The expression and activity of SCRT2 are intricately controlled by interactions with other transcription factors and microRNAs, highlighting its importance in the complex regulatory networks that govern neural differentiation and survival (RodríguezAznar2011Repression; Goes2024ASCL1).

## Structure
The SCRT2 protein is a member of the Snail superfamily of zinc-finger transcription factors, characterized by its modular organization with conserved domains. The protein features a conserved C-terminus with 4-6 zinc fingers of the C2H2 type, which are crucial for DNA binding to E-box motifs (Paul2012Scratch2). These zinc-finger domains also facilitate nuclear localization, as constructs lacking this domain are restricted to the cytoplasm (Nakamura2018Functional).

SCRT2 contains a SNAG domain at the N-terminus, which is essential for transcriptional repression (Nakamura2018Functional). This domain is necessary for the repressor activity of the protein, although its function is not conserved in human SCRT1 (Paul2012Scratch2). Between the SNAG and zinc-finger domains lies the HINGE domain, which includes conserved Serine (S78) and Tyrosine (Y77) residues that are important for repressor activity (Nakamura2018Functional).

The SCRATCH domain, located between the SNAG and zinc-finger domains, is not required for nuclear localization or repressor activity, but it co-evolved with the HINGE domain and plays a role in modulating transcriptional repression (Nakamura2018Functional). The protein's structure and function are influenced by these domains, highlighting its role in transcriptional regulation.

## Function
SCRT2, a member of the Snail superfamily of zinc-finger transcription factors, plays a crucial role in neural development by regulating gene expression during neurogenesis. It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it modulates the transcription of target genes, influencing cell differentiation and development (Goes2020Scratch2). SCRT2 is involved in maintaining the postmitotic state of neurons by preventing cell cycle re-entry. It achieves this by downregulating miR-25, which in turn maintains high levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p57, ensuring neurons do not revert to a proliferative state (RodríguezAznar2013Scratch2).

SCRT2 also plays a role in neuronal survival during embryonic development by repressing the expression of Puma, a pro-apoptotic factor. This repression is crucial for antagonizing p53-mediated apoptosis, thereby promoting cell survival (RodríguezAznar2011Repression). The expression of SCRT2 is tightly regulated by microRNAs, such as miR-125b, which fine-tune its expression domain after transcription (Goes2020Scratch2). SCRT2's expression is also influenced by transcription factors like ASCL1, which promotes its expression in the neural tube, highlighting its role in early post-mitotic neural cells (Goes2024ASCL1).

## Interactions
SCRT2, a transcriptional repressor, is involved in various interactions that regulate gene expression during neural development. It is known to interact with nucleic acids by binding to specific DNA sequences, such as E-boxes, to repress transcription. For instance, SCRT2 binds to an E-box in the intron of the pro-apoptotic gene puma, repressing its transcription and thereby preventing apoptosis in neuronal cells (RodríguezAznar2011Repression).

SCRT2 is also regulated by other transcription factors. ASCL1, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, promotes the expression of SCRT2 by binding to an enhancer element near the SCRT2 transcription start site. This interaction is facilitated by ASCL1 acting as a pioneer factor, which can bind to closed chromatin and enable the recruitment of other factors like POU3F2, although POU3F2 alone does not drive SCRT2 transcription (Goes2024ASCL1).

These interactions highlight the role of SCRT2 in the complex regulatory networks that control neural development, balancing transcriptional repression and activation to ensure proper neuronal differentiation and survival.
