# GPR15LG

## Overview
GPR15LG is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 15 ligand, a protein involved in immune system regulation. This ligand specifically interacts with the G protein-coupled receptor GPR15, playing a crucial role in directing immune cells, particularly T cells, to sites of inflammation or infection. The protein functions as a chemoattractant, guiding T cells to tissues such as the skin, where it modulates inflammatory responses and contributes to immune homeostasis (Jensen2023Pellino). Beyond its role in immune cell trafficking, GPR15LG is implicated in various cellular pathways, including the inhibition of cAMP production and activation of ERK1/2 and calcium release pathways (Okamoto2023Emerging). Additionally, GPR15LG may act independently of GPR15, functioning as an antimicrobial peptide and influencing skin inflammation and barrier formation (Okamoto2023Emerging). Its involvement in diseases such as psoriasis underscores its clinical significance, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in inflammatory and infectious diseases (Dainichi2022C10orf99GPR15L).

## Function
GPR15LG is a ligand for the G protein-coupled receptor 15 (GPR15) and plays a significant role in immune system regulation, particularly in the context of inflammation. It acts as a chemoattractant for T cells, guiding them to specific tissues, such as the skin, where it regulates inflammatory responses. This function is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis and ensuring an effective immune response to infections or inflammatory stimuli (Jensen2023Pellino).

In the context of viral infections, GPR15LG is involved in the recruitment of T cells to sites of infection, which is essential for controlling viral replication and dissemination. For instance, in Pellino1 knockout mice, reduced expression of GPR15LG has been associated with delayed T cell recruitment during HSV-1 skin infections, leading to more effective viral replication and spread compared to wild-type mice. This suggests that GPR15LG plays a critical role in antiviral immunity, although its specific functions in other tissues frequently infected by viruses remain to be fully elucidated (Jensen2023Pellino).

Overall, GPR15LG's interaction with GPR15 is vital for directing immune cells to areas of inflammation or infection, thereby contributing to the body's defense mechanisms.

## Interactions
GPR15LG, also known as C10orf99, is a ligand for the G protein-coupled receptor GPR15. This interaction is highly specific, as GPR15LG does not cross-activate other chemokine receptors. The binding of GPR15LG to GPR15 inhibits cAMP production and activates pathways such as ERK1/2, calcium release, and chemotaxis in immune cells (Okamoto2023Emerging). GPR15LG is involved in immune regulation and is implicated in diseases like psoriasis, where it is upregulated in psoriatic skin. It may act independently of GPR15, functioning as an antimicrobial peptide and influencing skin inflammation and barrier formation (Okamoto2023Emerging).

In keratinocytes, GPR15LG induces the expression of proinflammatory mediators such as IL-1b, IL-6, and CXCL1, while reducing the expression of genes related to skin barrier formation, including filaggrin and loricrin (Dainichi2022C10orf99GPR15L). GPR15LG also influences various transcription factors involved in stress responses, such as EP300, SMAD3, and JUND, and negatively regulates the transcription of STAT2 and IRF2 target genes associated with type I IFN signaling (Dainichi2022C10orf99GPR15L). These interactions highlight GPR15LG's role in modulating inflammatory responses and skin barrier functions.
