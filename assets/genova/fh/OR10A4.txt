# OR10A4

## Overview
The OR10A4 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 10 subfamily A member 4, which is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as an olfactory receptor, playing a crucial role in the detection of odorant molecules and the initiation of olfactory signal transduction. Olfactory receptors, including OR10A4, are characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is typical of many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors. These receptors are responsible for the recognition and G protein-mediated transduction of odorant signals, contributing to the sense of smell. The OR10A4 gene is one of many olfactory receptor genes that form the largest gene family in the human genome, highlighting the complexity and diversity of the olfactory system (Qiu2020aarFDC).
