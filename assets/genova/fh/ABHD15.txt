# ABHD15

## Overview
ABHD15 is a gene that encodes the protein abhydrolase domain containing 15, which is primarily involved in lipid metabolism. This protein is predominantly expressed in adipose tissue, liver, and skeletal muscle, and plays a significant role in adipogenesis and insulin signaling. Although ABHD15 is categorized within the α/β hydrolase fold family, it does not exhibit hydrolase activity due to the absence of a catalytic serine residue (Stöckli2019ABHD15). Instead, ABHD15 functions by interacting with phosphodiesterase 3B (PDE3B), stabilizing it to regulate lipolysis in response to insulin. This interaction is crucial for maintaining metabolic homeostasis, and alterations in ABHD15 expression or function have been linked to metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes (Walenta2013αβHydrolase; Xia2018Loss).

## Function
ABHD15 is a protein involved in lipid metabolism, primarily expressed in adipose tissue, liver, and skeletal muscle. It is a direct and functional target of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), a master regulator of adipogenesis. During adipogenesis, ABHD15 expression is upregulated, playing a crucial role in the differentiation of adipocytes by promoting lipid accumulation and the expression of adipogenic marker genes (Qu2018Proteomics; Walenta2013αβHydrolase).

ABHD15 also has a protective role against apoptosis. Its expression increases in response to apoptotic stimuli, suggesting a compensatory mechanism to reduce apoptotic signaling. Knockdown of ABHD15 leads to increased apoptosis, characterized by elevated caspase activity and changes in apoptosis-related proteins such as BCL-2 and BAX (Qu2018Proteomics; Walenta2013αβHydrolase).

In the context of insulin signaling, ABHD15 is involved in the regulation of adipocyte lipolysis. It acts as a substrate for AKT, mediating insulin's effects on lipolysis by stabilizing phosphodiesterase 3B (PDE3B). Mice deficient in ABHD15 show unresponsiveness to insulin's effects on lipolysis, highlighting its critical role in this process (Yang2020Adipocyte).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the ABHD15 gene have been linked to several metabolic disorders, including obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. ABHD15 plays a critical role in insulin-mediated suppression of lipolysis by stabilizing phosphodiesterase 3B (PDE3B). Loss of ABHD15 impairs this process, leading to increased fatty acid release and elevated plasma free fatty acid levels, which contribute to insulin resistance (Xia2018Loss). In Abhd15 knockout mice, the absence of ABHD15 results in disrupted insulin signaling, reduced adiponectin levels, and impaired insulin sensitivity, particularly in older mice, indicating a direct link to insulin resistance (Xia2018Loss).

In humans, ABHD15 expression is reduced in the white adipose tissue of individuals with obesity and diabetes compared to those with normal glucose tolerance. This reduction correlates with markers of insulin resistance, suggesting that decreased ABHD15 expression is associated with metabolic dysfunction (Xia2018Loss). Additionally, conditions such as fasting, high-fat diets, and aging, which are characterized by elevated free fatty acid levels, are associated with decreased ABHD15 expression, further implicating its role in metabolic regulation (Walenta2013αβHydrolase).

## Interactions
ABHD15 interacts with phosphodiesterase 3B (PDE3B) in adipose tissue, playing a crucial role in lipid and glucose metabolism. This interaction is significant for the stabilization of PDE3B, which is essential for insulin to inhibit lipolysis by hydrolyzing cyclic AMP (cAMP). The stabilization of PDE3B by ABHD15 reduces cAMP levels, leading to decreased phosphorylation and inactivation of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), thereby reducing lipolytic activity (Xia2018Loss). 

ABHD15 and PDE3B are suggested to form a stable dimeric complex, with ABHD15 potentially stabilizing PDE3B, as the loss of ABHD15 results in reduced PDE3B levels (Stöckli2019ABHD15). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have confirmed the physical interaction between ABHD15 and PDE3B in various cell types, including 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Xia2018Loss). 

ABHD15 does not exhibit hydrolase activity, as it lacks a catalytic serine residue and does not interact with a serine hydrolase activity probe (Stöckli2019ABHD15). The interaction between ABHD15 and PDE3B is not affected by isoproterenol or insulin treatment, indicating a stable association (Xia2018Loss).
