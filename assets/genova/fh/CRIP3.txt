# CRIP3

## Overview
Cysteine-rich protein 3 (CRIP3) is a gene that encodes a member of the LIM/double zinc-finger protein family, which is characterized by the presence of LIM domains that facilitate protein-protein interactions. The CRIP3 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal organization and signal transduction, due to its ability to interact with other proteins through its zinc-finger motifs. It is expressed in multiple tissues and has been implicated in the regulation of cell differentiation and proliferation. The precise biological functions of CRIP3 and its role in human health and disease are subjects of ongoing research, with studies suggesting its involvement in pathways such as the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway (Qiu2020aarFDC).
