# PATE2

## Overview
PATE2 is a gene that encodes the protein prostate and testis expressed 2, which is primarily expressed in the prostate and testicular tissues. This protein is categorized as a member of the cysteine-rich secretory protein (CRISP) family, which is known for its role in reproductive processes and immune modulation. The PATE2 protein is involved in various cellular functions, including cell signaling and interaction, and may play a role in the regulation of reproductive physiology. Its expression pattern suggests a potential involvement in the development and function of the male reproductive system, although the precise mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. Understanding the function and regulation of PATE2 could provide insights into male fertility and associated disorders (Qiu2020aarFDC).
