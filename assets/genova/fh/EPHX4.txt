# EPHX4

## Overview
The EPHX4 gene encodes the protein epoxide hydrolase 4 (EH4), which is a member of the α/β hydrolase fold enzyme family. EH4 is primarily expressed in the brain and eyes, suggesting its involvement in endogenous regulatory functions rather than in the metabolism of xenobiotics (Decker2009Mammalian). Despite its structural similarity to other epoxide hydrolases, the specific substrates and physiological roles of EH4 remain largely undetermined (hew2019substrate; Gautheron2020The). The protein is characterized by a catalytic triad typical of epoxide hydrolases, yet no enzymatic activity has been observed with tested substrates, raising questions about its functional significance in human physiology (hew2019substrate). EPHX4 has also been implicated in various diseases, including cancer, where its expression levels correlate with patient outcomes, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Özenver2023Identification; Luo2023Comprehensive).

## Structure


## Function
Epoxide hydrolase 4 (EH4), encoded by the EPHX4 gene, is a member of the α/β hydrolase fold enzyme family. It is primarily expressed in the brain and eyes, suggesting a role in the regulation of endogenous functions rather than in xenobiotic metabolism (Decker2009Mammalian). Despite its structural similarity to other epoxide hydrolases, EH4's specific substrates and physiological functions remain undetermined (hew2019substrate; Gautheron2020The).

EH4 consists of 362 amino acids and features a catalytic triad composed of Asp169, His336, and Asp307, supported by the conserved Tyr281. This structure is typical of epoxide hydrolases, which catalyze the hydrolysis of epoxides to less reactive diols (hew2019substrate). However, no enzymatic activity has been detected towards any tested substrate, raising questions about its functional role in human physiology (hew2019substrate).

The protein is potentially membrane-bound, complicating the differentiation between correctly folded and misfolded proteins after recombinant expression (hew2019substrate). EH4 shares a 45% amino acid sequence identity with EH3, another epoxide hydrolase, indicating potential functional similarities, although its exact role in cellular processes remains speculative (Decker2009Mammalian).

## Clinical Significance
EPHX4 has been implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression levels and potential role in tumor biology. Studies have shown that EPHX4 is significantly overexpressed in certain tumor types, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where its expression correlates with patient survival outcomes. This suggests that EPHX4 could serve as a prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target in HCC (Luo2023Comprehensive). The gene's expression is also associated with worse overall survival in renal clear cell carcinoma and renal papillary cell carcinoma, indicating its broader relevance in cancer prognosis (Özenver2023Identification).

In the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, EPHX4 has been identified as a hub gene with significant expression changes, suggesting a role in the co-pathogenesis of COVID-19 and HCC. The gene's expression is linked to immune response processes, particularly involving T cell and monocyte differentiation, which are crucial in the progression of HCC in patients co-infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Luo2023Comprehensive). These findings highlight the importance of EPHX4 in both cancer and infectious disease contexts, underscoring its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.
