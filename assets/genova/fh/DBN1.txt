# DBN1

## Overview
The DBN1 gene encodes the protein drebrin 1, an actin-binding protein that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the cytoskeleton, particularly within neuronal cells. Drebrin 1 is categorized as an actin-binding protein and is integral to processes such as neuronal migration, synaptic plasticity, and the maintenance of dendritic spine morphology. The protein is expressed in various isoforms, including drebrin E1, E2, and A, which are produced through alternative splicing and exhibit distinct expression patterns during development and in adult brains (Shirao2017The; Shirao2017General). Drebrin 1's interactions with other proteins, such as EB3 and Homer, facilitate its involvement in cellular signaling pathways and cytoskeletal dynamics, impacting cognitive functions and synaptic stability (Worth2013Drebrin; Mancini2011Regulation). Alterations in DBN1 expression or function have been linked to neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, and its role in viral infections and leukemia highlights its broader clinical significance (Li2017Drebrin; Maki2021Physical; Kreis2019ATM).

## Structure
The DBN1 gene encodes drebrin proteins, which are actin-binding proteins involved in brain development and synaptic function. Drebrin proteins are produced through alternative splicing, resulting in isoforms such as drebrin E1, E2, and A. Drebrin E1 is expressed during early developmental stages, while drebrin E2 includes an additional 43-amino-acid insertion (Ins1). Drebrin A, predominant in adult brains, has a further 46-amino-acid insertion (Ins2) preceding Ins1 (Shirao2017The; Shirao2017General).

Drebrin proteins are characterized by their acidic nature and an isoelectric point around 4.2. They are heavily phosphorylated, which may influence their actin-binding activity (Shirao2017General). The primary structure of drebrin includes specific insertion sequences that differentiate the isoforms. Drebrin has two actin-binding regions, AB1 and AB2, with AB1 activity regulated by phosphorylation (Shirao2017The).

The tertiary structure of drebrin is suggested to be complex, related to its interactions with the cytoskeleton, although detailed structural information is not provided in the context. Drebrin A is localized in dendritic spines, indicating its role in synaptic plasticity and function (Shirao2017The; Shirao2017General).

## Function
Drebrin 1, encoded by the DBN1 gene, is an actin-binding protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of the cytoskeleton in healthy human cells. It is primarily active in the cytoplasm of neurons, where it influences cell shape, motility, and intracellular transport, impacting cognitive functions and synaptic plasticity (Shirao2017General). Drebrin 1 stabilizes actin filaments by binding to and organizing filamentous actin (F-actin) in dendritic spines, which are essential for higher brain functions such as learning and memory (Mikati2013Drebrininduced).

Drebrin 1 is involved in neuronal migration, neuritogenesis, and the reorganization of actin filaments in dendritic spines. It links dynamic microtubules to actin filaments in filopodia by binding to the microtubule-binding +TIP protein EB3, a process essential for neuronal migration and neuritogenesis (Worth2013Drebrin). The protein's F-actin-bundling activity is regulated by phosphorylation at serine 142 by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), which relieves an intramolecular repression, allowing drebrin to bundle F-actin or stabilize existing F-actin bundles (Worth2013Drebrin).

Drebrin 1 also plays a role in synaptic plasticity by modulating the actin cytoskeleton, forming a complex with actin and myosin, and inhibiting the actin-activated ATPase activity of myosin II (Shirao2017General). This regulation is crucial for maintaining dendritic spine morphology and synaptic stability, which are associated with cognitive functions (Shirao2017General).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the DBN1 gene, which encodes the actin-binding protein drebrin, have been implicated in several neurological disorders. In Alzheimer's disease, a reduction in drebrin levels is associated with increased susceptibility to oxidative stress and synaptic dysfunction, contributing to cognitive deficits (Kreis2019ATM). The phosphorylation of drebrin by ATM kinase at serine-647 is crucial for oxidative stress resistance in neurons, and disruptions in this process may exacerbate synaptic loss and cognitive decline (Kreis2019ATM). 

In the context of viral infections, DBN1 plays a role in restricting rotavirus entry by inhibiting dynamin-mediated endocytosis. Loss of DBN1 function enhances rotavirus infection, suggesting its importance as a host restriction factor (Li2017Drebrin). This function highlights the potential impact of DBN1 alterations on immune responses and viral pathogenesis.

In leukemia, the interaction between DBN1 and the BAALC gene contributes to chemoresistance by promoting the adhesion of leukemic cells to the bone marrow niche. Disrupting this interaction could potentially overcome drug resistance in BAALC-activated leukemia (Maki2021Physical). These findings underscore the clinical significance of DBN1 in various diseases.

## Interactions
Drebrin 1 (DBN1) is an actin-binding protein that participates in various physical interactions with other proteins, influencing cellular processes. DBN1 interacts with the microtubule plus-tip binding protein EB3, which is crucial for linking F-actin and dynamic microtubules, particularly during myoblast fusion and differentiation (Mancini2011Regulation). It also binds to the scaffold protein Homer, specifically Homer2b, promoting signaling by the calcineurin/NFAT pathway, which enhances myoblast differentiation and myotube formation (Mancini2011Regulation).

DBN1 interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of the chemokine receptor CXCR4, suggesting a role in regulating calcium signaling (Mancini2011Regulation). During rotavirus infection, DBN1 interacts with the viral protein VP4, specifically the C-terminal VP5* fragment, and colocalizes with actin filaments at the plasma membrane, restricting viral entry by inhibiting dynamin-mediated endocytosis (Li2017Drebrin).

DBN1 also interacts with cortactin (CTTN), a protein that assists dynamin-2-mediated endocytosis, and this interaction is necessary for DBN1's ability to inhibit dynamin function and restrict virus entry (Li2017Drebrin). These interactions highlight DBN1's role in cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular signaling pathways.
