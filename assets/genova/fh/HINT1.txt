# HINT1

## Overview
The HINT1 gene encodes the histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1, a member of the histidine triad (HIT) superfamily, which is characterized by its conserved His-X-His-X-His-XX motif. This protein functions primarily as a purine nucleotide hydrolase and transferase, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes such as transcriptional regulation, signal transduction, and apoptosis (Brenner2002Hint; Krakowiak2019The). HINT1 is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues and is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it associates with cytoskeletal structures (Li2005Hint1). It is involved in the metabolism of phosphorothioate oligonucleotides and has been implicated in tumor suppression, with studies indicating that its absence can lead to increased tumor susceptibility (Krakowiak2019The; Li2005Hint1). Mutations in the HINT1 gene are linked to neurological disorders such as autosomal recessive axonal neuropathy with neuromyotonia (NMAN), highlighting its clinical significance (de2021HINT1; Peeters2016Axonal).

## Structure
The HINT1 protein is a member of the histidine triad (HIT) superfamily, characterized by the conserved motif His-X-His-X-His-XX, where X represents a hydrophobic amino acid (Brenner2002Hint; Shah2018Structure). The primary structure of HINT1 consists of 126 amino acids, featuring a CaM-binding motif in the N-terminal region and a SUMO-interacting motif near the C-terminus (CortésMontero2021Human).

The secondary structure of HINT1 includes three helices and seven β-sheets, with the remaining sequences being linear (CortésMontero2021Human). The tertiary structure is compact and globular, with a central β-sheet flanked by α-helices (Dolot2023Crystal). The protein forms a homodimer, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity and stability (Shah2018Structure; Dolot2023Crystal).

HINT1 is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and cell cycle control, and is considered a potential tumor suppressor (Dolot2023Crystal). It exhibits SUMOylase activity, which is activated by calcium-activated calmodulin and/or nitric oxide (CortésMontero2021Human). The protein's structure has been extensively studied, with numerous structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (AmorBarris2023Indepth).

## Function
The HINT1 gene encodes the histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1, which is a member of the histidine triad (HIT) superfamily. This protein functions primarily as a purine nucleotide hydrolase and transferase, catalyzing the cleavage of phosphoramidate bonds. It is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of transcription, signal transduction, and apoptosis (Krakowiak2019The; Su2003Deletion).

HINT1 is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues and is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it associates with cytoskeletal structures (Li2005Hint1). It plays a role in the metabolism of phosphorothioate oligonucleotides, converting them into nucleoside monophosphates and releasing hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a gasotransmitter involved in neurotransmission, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and immune responses (Krakowiak2019The).

The protein is also implicated in tumor suppression, as studies have shown that its absence leads to increased susceptibility to tumor development in mice, suggesting a potential role in preventing tumorigenesis in humans (Li2005Hint1). HINT1's enzymatic activity is crucial for maintaining proper cellular function and preventing the accumulation of substrates that could inhibit kinase activity, thereby ensuring effective transcription regulation (Bieganowski2002Adenosine).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HINT1 gene are associated with autosomal recessive axonal neuropathy with neuromyotonia (NMAN), a condition characterized by muscle stiffness, cramps, and delayed muscle relaxation due to peripheral nerve hyperexcitability (de2021HINT1; Peeters2016Axonal). This neuropathy is a subtype of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, specifically affecting motor neurons more than sensory neurons, and is prevalent in Central and South-Eastern Europe, Eastern Asia, and Turkey (AmorBarris2021HINT1; Malcorps2022HINT1). The p.Arg37Pro mutation is a common founder mutation linked to this condition (de2021HINT1; Laššuthová2014Mutations).

HINT1 mutations can lead to altered interactions with partner proteins, disrupting essential signaling pathways in motor neurons. These disruptions may contribute to neurological disorders, including motor coordination issues and neurodegenerative diseases (CortésMontero2021Human). Despite the significant impact of these mutations, HINT1 knockout mice do not exhibit neuropathy-related phenotypes, suggesting that the mutant proteins' interactions with other proteins are crucial in causing the disease (Shah2018Structure).

Altered expression levels of HINT1 have been implicated in certain cancers, affecting tumor progression and response to therapy. Loss of HINT1 function increases susceptibility to carcinogenesis in mice (de2021HINT1).

## Interactions
HINT1, a histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein, interacts with a variety of proteins, playing a significant role in cellular signaling and regulatory processes. It forms complexes with the NR1 subunit of NMDA receptors (NMDARs), which is crucial for modulating receptor activity and maintaining normal motor neuron function (VicenteSánchez2013HINT1; CortésMontero2021Human). HINT1 also interacts with G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) and cannabinoid receptor 1 (CNR1), stabilizing their association with NMDARs and influencing calcium fluxes (VicenteSánchez2013HINT1).

The protein's interaction with calcium-activated calmodulin (CaM) regulates its SUMOylase activity, which is essential for transcriptional control (CortésMontero2021Human). HINT1 also binds to the intracellular domain of teneurin 1, with calcium modulating this interaction (CortésMontero2021Human). Mutations in HINT1 can disrupt these interactions, leading to neurological disorders such as axonal motor neuropathy (CortésMontero2021Human).

HINT1's role extends to tumor suppression, where it interacts with transcription factors like MITF and β-catenin, influencing the Wnt signaling pathway and cellular processes such as cancer migration and invasion (CarrilloNajar2021Comparative). These interactions highlight HINT1's multifaceted role in cellular regulation and its potential as a therapeutic target.
