# ZNF169

## Overview
ZNF169 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 169, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by their zinc finger motifs, which enable them to bind to DNA and play crucial roles in transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger protein 169 is involved in various cellular processes, including gene expression modulation and chromatin remodeling. The gene's expression and function have been linked to several diseases, including cancer and genetic disorders, due to its role in transcriptional regulation and interaction with other cellular proteins (Li2019Classification; Cao2018Biclustering). The protein's ability to influence gene expression makes it a significant factor in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions (Gonda2019Genetic).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZNF169 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to mutations, altered expression levels, or changes in its normal interactions. In glioma, particularly those with IDH mutations, deletions in zinc finger motifs of ZNF169 are more prevalent, suggesting a role in malignant progression (Li2019Classification). In colorectal cancer, ZNF169 is associated with drug resistance mechanisms, particularly in resistance to chemotherapy drugs like 5-Fluorouracil and Oxaliplatin (Cao2018Biclustering). 

In the context of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in ZNF169, identified as Q583H (rs12350212), has been linked to progression-free survival, indicating its potential impact on prognosis (Sellick2008Scan). Additionally, ZNF169 has been involved in genetic interactions related to major depressive disorder, although no direct disease association has been established (Gonda2019Genetic).

A large deletion involving ZNF169 was identified in a family with basal cell nevus syndrome, suggesting its involvement in this condition (Takahashi2009Germline). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ZNF169 in various pathological contexts.
