# CFAP144

## Overview
CFAP144, or cilia and flagella associated protein 144, is a gene that encodes a protein crucial for the proper functioning of cilia and flagella, which are essential organelles involved in cell motility and sensory functions. The CFAP144 protein plays a significant role in the assembly and stability of axonemes, the core structural components of these organelles, by maintaining the specific arrangement of microtubules necessary for their function. This protein is categorized as a structural protein due to its involvement in maintaining the integrity of ciliary and flagellar structures. CFAP144 is vital for various physiological processes, including respiratory function and reproductive health, by ensuring the effective operation of cilia in clearing airways and flagella in sperm motility (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Function
CFAP144, or cilia and flagella associated protein 144, is integral to the structure and function of cilia and flagella, which are essential for various cellular processes. These hair-like organelles are present on the surface of many cell types and are crucial for cell movement, fluid flow, and sensory functions. CFAP144 is involved in the assembly and stability of axonemes, the core structural component of cilia and flagella. The axoneme is composed of microtubules arranged in a specific pattern, and CFAP144 contributes to maintaining this structure, ensuring proper ciliary and flagellar function.

In healthy human cells, CFAP144's role in axoneme stability is vital for processes such as respiratory function, where cilia help clear mucus and debris from the airways. It also impacts reproductive health, as flagella are necessary for sperm motility. The protein's activity within the cell is primarily localized to the cilia and flagella, where it supports their structural integrity and functional capabilities. By facilitating the proper assembly and maintenance of these organelles, CFAP144 ensures that cells can perform their necessary physiological roles effectively.
