# UGGT2

## Overview
UGGT2 (UDP-glucose glycoprotein glucosyltransferase 2) is a gene that encodes a crucial enzyme involved in the protein quality control system within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of human cells. The protein product of UGGT2 is a glucosyltransferase that plays a significant role in the calnexin/calreticulin cycle by reglucosylating misfolded glycoproteins, thereby facilitating their proper folding and maturation. This enzyme is particularly specialized in modifying soluble lysosomal proteins, distinguishing its function from the broader substrate range of its homolog, UGGT1. The activity of UGGT2 is modulated by its interaction with the selenoprotein Sep15, which enhances its enzymatic function. Despite its lower activity compared to UGGT1, UGGT2 is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis, especially under conditions of ER stress, by ensuring the correct folding of specific glycoproteins (Adams2020Quantitative; Takeda2014Both).

## Structure
UGGT2 (UDP-glucose glycoprotein glucosyltransferase 2) is an enzyme involved in the protein quality control system within the endoplasmic reticulum. The enzyme is composed of a catalytic domain and a carbohydrate-binding domain, which are crucial for its function in recognizing and reglucosylating misfolded glycoproteins (Adams2020Quantitative; Takeda2014Both). The catalytic domain of UGGT2 shares a high degree of sequence identity with UGGT1, particularly in the C-terminal region, which is responsible for its glucosyltransferase activity (Takeda2016Effects). 

UGGT2 is known to undergo post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and phosphorylation, which may influence its activity and stability (Adams2020Quantitative). The presence of splice variant isoforms of UGGT2 suggests potential alterations in its functional domains, although specific details on these variants are not extensively documented (Adams2020Quantitative). 

The enzyme's structure allows it to interact with misfolded glycoproteins, facilitating their proper folding by adding a glucose moiety. This activity is enhanced by the presence of the selenoprotein Sep15, which modulates UGGT2's activity through complex formation (Takeda2014Both).

## Function
UGGT2 (UDP-glucose glycoprotein glucosyltransferase 2) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the quality control of glycoprotein folding within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of human cells. It functions by reglucosylating improperly folded glycoproteins, thereby marking them for refolding through the calnexin/calreticulin cycle, a key quality control mechanism that ensures proper protein folding (Adams2020Quantitative; Takeda2014Both).

UGGT2 is particularly involved in the modification of soluble lysosomal proteins, with a significant portion of its substrates being lysosomal enzymes. This suggests a specialized role for UGGT2 in the reglucosylation of lysosomal proteins, which is distinct from the broader substrate range of UGGT1, another glucosyltransferase in the ER (Adams2020Quantitative). UGGT2 substrates are generally larger proteins with a higher number of N-glycans and tend to have low isoelectric points, indicating a preference for specific physicochemical properties (Adams2020Quantitative).

The enzymatic activity of UGGT2 is enhanced by the presence of Sep15, a selenoprotein, suggesting a regulatory interaction that may modulate its function under certain conditions (Takeda2014Both). Despite its lower activity compared to UGGT1, UGGT2 contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis by ensuring the proper folding and quality control of specific proteins, particularly those related to lysosomal function (Takeda2016Effects; Adams2020Quantitative).

## Interactions
UGGT2 interacts with the selenoprotein Sep15, forming a heterodimeric complex that significantly enhances UGGT2's glucosyltransferase activity. This interaction is particularly notable as Sep15, characterized by a Cys-X-Sec triad, acts as a potent oxidoreductase, potentially modulating UGGT2's activity through redox-controlled mechanisms. The presence of Sep15 increases UGGT2's enzymatic activity by approximately four times compared to when UGGT2 is expressed alone (Takeda2014Both). 

UGGT2 also shows a preference for interacting with soluble lysosomal proteins, which is significant given that some of these substrates are associated with lysosomal storage diseases. This interaction pattern is distinct from UGGT1, which modifies both soluble and membrane proteins (Adams2020Quantitative). The substrate selectivity of UGGT2 is influenced by its preference for proteins with low isoelectric points and a higher number of N-glycans, which are typically larger and more heavily glycosylated (Adams2020Quantitative). 

These interactions highlight UGGT2's role in the endoplasmic reticulum's protein quality control system, particularly under conditions of ER stress, where it may act as a folding sensor and regulator of glycoprotein maturation.
