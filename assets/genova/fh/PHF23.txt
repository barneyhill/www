# PHF23

## Overview
PHF23 is a gene that encodes the PHD finger protein 23, a protein characterized by the presence of a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger, which is a zinc finger-like motif. This protein plays a significant role in chromatin-mediated transcriptional regulation by specifically binding to the trimethylated lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me3), a marker associated with active gene transcription. The PHD finger protein 23 functions as an epigenetic reader, recognizing specific histone modifications and facilitating chromatin interactions, thereby influencing gene expression. It is implicated in various cellular processes, including differentiation and proliferation, and is primarily active in the nucleus of healthy human cells. The protein's involvement in oncogenic processes, such as in non-small cell lung cancer and acute myeloid leukemia, highlights its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Cheng2023PHF23; Zhang2020Mechanistic; Baker2008PHD).

## Structure
PHF23 (PHD finger protein 23) is characterized by the presence of a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger, a zinc finger-like motif that plays a crucial role in chromatin-mediated transcriptional regulation. The PHD finger of PHF23 specifically binds to the trimethylated lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me3), a mark associated with active gene transcription. This interaction is facilitated by an aromatic cage within the PHD finger, which accommodates the methylated lysine, with key residues forming a hydrophobic environment for binding (Zhang2020Mechanistic).

The PHD finger domain is essential for the protein's function in both leukemogenesis and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In the context of the NUP98-PHF23 fusion protein, the PHD finger is implicated in aberrant chromatin modification and transcriptional activation, contributing to oncogenic processes (Zhang2020Mechanistic; Gough2014NUP98–PHF23). In NSCLC, the PHD domain facilitates the interaction with ACTN4, stabilizing it and promoting the activation of the ERK signaling pathway, which is crucial for cancer cell proliferation and chemoresistance (Cheng2023PHF23).

PHF23 may undergo post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination, which influences its stability and interactions, particularly in the context of cancer (Cheng2023PHF23).

## Function
PHF23 (PHD finger protein 23) is involved in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation through its PHD finger domain, which recognizes specific histone modifications. This domain is known to bind to H3K4me3, a histone mark associated with active chromatin, suggesting a role in chromatin interaction and transcriptional regulation (Katoh2015Functional; Baker2008PHD). PHF23 functions as an epigenetic scaffold/adaptor, potentially recognizing specific histone modifications and facilitating chromatin binding (Katoh2015Functional).

In healthy human cells, PHF23 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it participates in cellular processes such as differentiation and proliferation. The PHD finger domain of PHF23 is crucial for its role as a 'reader/effector' module, interpreting histone methylation marks and influencing gene expression (Baker2008PHD). Although the specific function of PHF23 in normal cellular processes is not fully detailed, its involvement in chromatin regulation and gene expression suggests it plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating transcriptional activity (Katoh2015Functional; Baker2008PHD). Further experimental validation is needed to elucidate its precise chromatin targets and interacting proteins in healthy cells (Katoh2015Functional).

## Clinical Significance
PHF23 has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in gene expression regulation and chromatin remodeling. In osteoarthritis (OA), PHF23 acts as a negative regulator of autophagy in chondrocytes. Its increased expression in OA patients' cartilage and synovial tissue is associated with reduced autophagy and increased apoptosis, contributing to the disease's progression. Knockdown of PHF23 in OA models enhances autophagy and reduces apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2019Plant; Maimaitijuma2020PHF23).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), PHF23 is overexpressed and linked to poor prognosis. It promotes tumor proliferation, metastasis, and chemoresistance by stabilizing ACTN4 and activating the ERK signaling pathway. This overexpression correlates with increased tumor growth and resistance to chemotherapy, highlighting PHF23 as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in NSCLC (Cheng2023PHF23).

PHF23 is also involved in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) through the NUP98-PHF23 fusion protein. This fusion leads to leukemic transformation by binding to H3K4me3-marked genes, contributing to aberrant gene expression and impaired differentiation in hematopoietic cells. Targeting the PHD domain of this fusion protein is being explored as a therapeutic strategy (Zhang2020Mechanistic; Gough2014NUP98–PHF23).

## Interactions
PHF23 (PHD finger protein 23) is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), PHF23 interacts with alpha-actinin-4 (ACTN4), stabilizing it by inhibiting its ubiquitination. This interaction is crucial for the activation of the ERK signaling pathway, which promotes cell proliferation, migration, and chemoresistance in NSCLC cells (Cheng2023PHF23). The interaction between PHF23 and ACTN4 is dependent on the PHD-like zinc finger domain of PHF23, and deletion of this domain disrupts the interaction, leading to decreased cancer cell proliferation and migration (Cheng2023PHF23).

In the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), PHF23 forms a fusion protein with NUP98, known as NUP98-PHF23. This fusion protein interacts with chromatin by binding to the H3K4me3 histone mark through the PHD finger domain of PHF23. This interaction is essential for the leukemogenic activity of the fusion protein, as it colocalizes with specific gene sites crucial for hematopoietic stem and precursor cell function (Zhang2020Mechanistic). The PHD finger domain's interaction with H3K4me3 is a common feature in NUP98 fusions with other proteins, highlighting its role in oncogenic transformation (Zhang2020Mechanistic).
