# FDCSP

## Overview
FDCSP, or follicular dendritic cell secreted protein, is a gene that encodes a secreted protein primarily associated with the immune system. The protein is predominantly expressed by follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) located in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues, such as lymph nodes and tonsils. It plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses, particularly by influencing B cell maturation and migration, which are essential processes in the adaptive immune response (Marshall2002FDCSP; AlAlwan2007Follicular). FDCSP is regulated by inflammatory stimuli and is involved in the chemotaxis of B cells, acting similarly to cytokines or chemokines (AlAlwan2007Follicular). Beyond its immunological functions, FDCSP is also expressed in periodontal ligament cells, where it may help maintain tissue homeostasis by inhibiting osteogenic differentiation (Wei2011Effect; Xiang2014Transfection). The gene's expression is clinically significant in various diseases, including immune-related disorders and certain cancers, where it serves as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Wu2022FDCSP; Facchetti2021Follicular).

## Structure


## Function
FDCSP (follicular dendritic cell secreted protein) is a secreted protein primarily expressed by follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) within germinal centers of lymphoid tissues such as tonsils and lymph nodes. It plays a significant role in regulating immune responses, particularly influencing B cell behavior during immune responses. FDCSP specifically binds to activated B cells, suggesting its involvement in B cell maturation and migration within germinal centers (Marshall2002FDCSP; AlAlwan2007Follicular).

The expression of FDCSP is regulated by inflammatory stimuli, including TNF-α and LPS, and is up-regulated in immunologically active tissues. This regulation indicates its role in facilitating intercellular communication during immune responses, potentially functioning similarly to cytokines or chemokines (Marshall2002FDCSP; AlAlwan2007Follicular). FDCSP is involved in the chemotaxis of B cells, enhancing their migration towards chemokines like CXCL12 and CXCL13, which are crucial for germinal center reactions and antibody responses (AlAlwan2007Follicular).

In addition to its role in immune regulation, FDCSP is expressed in periodontal ligament cells, where it may act as a fibroblastic phenotype stabilizer, inhibiting osteogenic differentiation and maintaining the unmineralized state of periodontal tissues (Wei2011Effect; Xiang2014Transfection).

## Clinical Significance
The FDCSP gene is clinically significant in various diseases, particularly in immune-related disorders and certain cancers. In HPV-positive head and neck squamous carcinoma (HPV+ HNSC), FDCSP is expressed at higher levels and is associated with a favorable prognosis. Its expression is positively correlated with TP53, and mutations in TP53 can lead to decreased FDCSP expression, suggesting that TP53 mutations may downregulate FDCSP (Wu2022FDCSP). FDCSP is also linked to immune processes such as T-cell activation and chemokine signaling pathways, and it is associated with CXCL13, a chemokine involved in B-cell attraction (Wu2022FDCSP).

In follicular dendritic cell sarcoma (FDCS), FDCSP is overexpressed and serves as a novel marker for the disease, which is characterized by malignant proliferation of follicular dendritic cells (Facchetti2021Follicular). The gene's expression is also noted in breast cancer patients with BRCA1 mutations, where it is associated with a cancer stem cell signature in a basal-like breast cancer phenotype (Arakelyan2021Transcriptome). These associations highlight the potential role of FDCSP in the pathogenesis and prognosis of various cancers.
