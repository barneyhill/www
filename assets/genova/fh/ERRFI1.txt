# ERRFI1

## Overview
ERRFI1, or ERBB receptor feedback inhibitor 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway. The protein, categorized as a feedback inhibitor, plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by modulating EGFR activity. It achieves this by binding to EGFR, inhibiting its catalytic function, and promoting its degradation, thereby preventing excessive cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis in certain contexts (Cui2021ERRFI1; Reschke2009Mitogeninducible). ERRFI1's function as a tumor suppressor is underscored by its involvement in various cancers, where its expression levels can influence disease progression and response to therapies (Xu2021Gene). Additionally, ERRFI1 is implicated in metabolic disorders and inflammatory diseases, highlighting its broad significance in human health (Gough2023Dissection).

## Function
ERRFI1, also known as ERBB receptor feedback inhibitor 1, functions as a critical regulator of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway in healthy human cells. It acts as a negative feedback inhibitor by directly binding to EGFR, inhibiting its catalytic activity, and promoting its lysosomal degradation. This regulatory mechanism helps control cell signaling pathways associated with EGFR, which are essential for cell growth and differentiation (Cui2021ERRFI1).

In addition to its role in EGFR regulation, ERRFI1 is involved in modulating cell proliferation and survival. It exerts antiapoptotic and antiangiogenic effects, particularly in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, by inhibiting EGFR signaling. This suggests that ERRFI1 plays a protective role in maintaining cellular functions and preventing abnormal cell proliferation and apoptosis (Chen2023Exploring).

ERRFI1 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it contributes to cellular homeostasis by preventing uncontrolled cell growth. Its function as a tumor suppressor is highlighted by its ability to decrease the proliferation of cells expressing high levels of EGFR, thereby maintaining normal cellular processes (Barkovskaya2020Inhibition).

## Clinical Significance
The ERRFI1 gene, also known as Gene 33, is implicated in various cancers and other diseases due to its role in cell signaling pathways. In breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast carcinoma, underexpression of ERRFI1 is common and associated with disease progression by elevating ErbB2 activity. It acts as a tumor suppressor in some breast cancer cells but is required for metastasis in others (Xu2021Gene). In lung cancer, ERRFI1 is frequently deleted, especially in smoking patients and those with squamous cell carcinoma, leading to increased EGFR phosphorylation and tumor progression (Xu2021Gene). In glioblastoma, ERRFI1 is often deleted, and its downregulation contributes to tumor progression by impairing its role as a negative regulator of EGFR (Duncan2010Integrated).

ERRFI1 is also involved in resistance to targeted cancer therapies, such as EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, where its altered expression can lead to drug resistance in non-small cell lung cancer and other cancers (Xu2021Gene). Beyond cancer, ERRFI1 is linked to metabolic disorders, including diabetes, where its expression is associated with diabetic nephropathy and insulin sensitivity (Xu2021Gene). In psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, ERRFI1 is implicated in the disease pathogenesis through its regulation of EGFR signaling, with genetic variants affecting its expression (Gough2023Dissection).

## Interactions
ERRFI1, also known as ERBB receptor feedback inhibitor 1, is involved in several protein interactions that regulate cellular processes. ERRFI1 physically interacts with the protein PDCD2, which is associated with apoptosis regulation. This interaction has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis, indicating that PDCD2 forms a complex with ERRFI1. The interaction between ERRFI1 and PDCD2 is crucial for inducing apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, particularly in response to tryptophan deficiency (Cui2021ERRFI1).

ERRFI1 also acts as a negative regulator of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway. It binds to EGFR, inhibiting its catalytic activity and promoting its lysosomal degradation. This interaction is part of a negative feedback loop that regulates EGFR activation and stability, playing a significant role in controlling cell growth and proliferation (Reschke2009Mitogeninducible).

In glioma, ERRFI1 is targeted by miR-148a-3p, which inhibits ERRFI1, thereby activating the EGFR/MAPK signaling pathway. This interaction highlights ERRFI1's role in tumor suppression by modulating signaling pathways involved in tumor angiogenesis and progression (Wang2020Glioma).
