# FBXO10

## Overview
FBXO10 is a gene that encodes the F-box protein 10, a member of the F-box protein family, which is integral to the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This protein functions as part of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex, playing a pivotal role in targeting specific proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. F-box protein 10 is particularly involved in the regulation of apoptosis through its interaction with the anti-apoptotic oncoprotein BCL2, marking it for degradation and thus promoting cell death. This function is crucial in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation, particularly in the context of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), where FBXO10 acts as a tumor suppressor (Yang2014Protein). Additionally, FBXO10's interactions extend to other proteins involved in cell signaling pathways, underscoring its significance in cellular regulation and disease pathogenesis (Jiang2023Role).

## Function
FBXO10 is a member of the F-box protein family, which is characterized by an F-box motif that facilitates protein-protein interactions. It functions as part of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex, a crucial component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system responsible for targeting specific proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. This process is essential for regulating protein levels, cell cycle progression, and signal transduction in healthy human cells (Yang2014Protein).

FBXO10 specifically targets the anti-apoptotic oncoprotein BCL2 for ubiquitination and degradation. By regulating BCL2 protein levels, FBXO10 plays a significant role in promoting apoptosis, which is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation (Yang2014Protein). In the context of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), FBXO10 acts as a tumor suppressor by destabilizing BCL2, thereby facilitating apoptosis in lymphoma cells (Yang2014Protein).

FBXO10 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to cellular homeostasis and organismal development. Its activity in these cellular compartments underscores its importance in maintaining normal cell function and regulating apoptosis through the degradation of BCL2 (Yang2014Protein).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FBXO10 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and autoimmune conditions. In human B cell lymphomas, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) and mantle cell lymphomas (MCL), mutations or reduced expression of FBXO10 can lead to the overexpression of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL2, contributing to lymphoma development (MasleFarquhar2021Lossoffunction). 

The E54K missense variant of FBXO10 has been identified in individuals with autoimmune diseases and neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder. Although the direct role of this variant in these conditions remains unclear, its presence suggests potential associations that warrant further investigation (MasleFarquhar2021Lossoffunction).

FBXO10 has also been associated with mosaic loss of the X chromosome (mLOX) susceptibility in women. Carriers of certain missense variants in FBXO10 have a two-fold increased risk of mLOX, which is linked to an elevated risk of myeloid and lymphoid leukemias (Liu2023Population). These findings highlight the gene's potential role in chromosomal stability and cancer predisposition.

## Interactions
FBXO10 is a member of the F-box protein family and functions as a component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex. It plays a crucial role in targeting specific proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. One of the primary interactions of FBXO10 is with the anti-apoptotic oncoprotein BCL2. FBXO10 binds to BCL2, facilitating its ubiquitination and degradation, which is essential for regulating BCL2 protein levels in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cells (Yang2014Protein). This interaction is significant as it influences apoptosis in lymphoma cells, with mutations in FBXO10 reducing its ability to destabilize BCL2 (Yang2014Protein).

FBXO10 also interacts with the human germinal center-associated lymphoma (HGAL) protein. Upon B-cell receptor (BCR) stimulation, FBXO10 undergoes palmitoylation and relocates to the cell membrane, where it binds to HGAL. This interaction targets HGAL for ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. The binding of FBXO10 to HGAL is independent of HGAL phosphorylation and relies on a conserved residue (H91) of HGAL (Jiang2023Role). These interactions highlight FBXO10's role in regulating proteins involved in apoptosis and cell signaling pathways.
