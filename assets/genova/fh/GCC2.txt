# GCC2

## Overview
GCC2 is a gene that encodes the protein GRIP and coiled-coil domain containing 2, also known as GCC185, which is a crucial component in intracellular transport and vesicle trafficking. This protein is characterized by its GRIP domain and coiled-coil regions, which facilitate its localization to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and its function in maintaining Golgi apparatus integrity. GCC2 acts as a tethering molecule, interacting with Rab GTPases, particularly Rab9A, to mediate the recycling of mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) from endosomes to the TGN. This process is essential for lysosomal enzyme targeting and cellular homeostasis. Beyond its cellular functions, GCC2 has clinical significance, particularly in the context of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where its overexpression is linked to cancer progression and it serves as a potential biomarker for diagnosis and monitoring (Hong2024GCC2; He2022Case; Reddy2006A).

## Structure
The GCC2 protein, encoded by the GCC2 gene, is characterized by its structural components that include a GRIP domain and extensive coiled-coil regions. The GRIP domain is crucial for targeting the protein to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), where it plays a role in maintaining Golgi apparatus integrity and regulating vesicle transport (Hong2024GCC2). The coiled-coil regions facilitate the formation of rod-like, α-helical homodimers, which are essential for its function in intracellular trafficking and signaling (Hong2024GCC2).

The protein's structure allows it to interact with other proteins and maintain the structural integrity of the Golgi apparatus, which is vital for processes such as vesicle trafficking and cargo sorting (Hong2024GCC2). While specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not provided, the presence of these domains and structural motifs suggests a complex architecture that supports its functional roles in cellular processes.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence GCC2's function and interactions, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. The existence of splice variants could lead to different isoforms, potentially altering the protein's structural and functional properties.

## Function
GCC2, also known as GCC185, is a protein that plays a critical role in the recycling of mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) in human cells. This protein is essential for the transport of MPRs, which are crucial for lysosomal enzyme targeting and function. GCC2 acts as a tether for Rab9-positive, MPR-containing transport vesicles, facilitating their docking at the TGN. This process is vital for maintaining the proper localization and recycling of MPRs, ensuring efficient lysosomal enzyme delivery and cellular homeostasis (Reddy2006A).

In cells depleted of GCC2, there is a significant accumulation of MPR-positive vesicles, indicating a block in recycling and potential accumulation of transport intermediates. This leads to increased cellular levels of cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptors (CI-MPRs) and enhanced turnover of these receptors, as well as increased secretion of hexosaminidase, a lysosomal enzyme. These findings suggest that GCC2 is essential for the normal life cycle of MPRs and efficient lysosomal enzyme delivery in cells (Reddy2006A).

## Clinical Significance
The GCC2 gene has been implicated in the progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Overexpression of GCC2 in NSCLC is associated with enhanced cancer cell proliferation, migration, and survival. This is primarily due to its role in maintaining Golgi apparatus integrity and stimulating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathways, which are crucial for cancer cell growth and survival. Silencing GCC2 in NSCLC cell lines has been shown to reduce cancer cell viability, induce apoptosis, and decrease the expression of cancer stem cell (CSC) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes, which are linked to metastatic progression (Hong2024GCC2).

GCC2 has also been identified as a potential non-invasive diagnostic biomarker for NSCLC, with elevated levels found in exosomes from patient plasmas. This suggests its utility in early detection and monitoring of the disease (Hong2024GCC2).

In addition to NSCLC, a rare GCC2-ALK fusion has been reported in a case of pulmonary inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT). This fusion was responsive to treatment with ensartinib, a second-generation ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor, highlighting the potential for targeted therapies in tumors harboring this genetic alteration (He2022Case).

## Interactions
GCC2, also known as golgin-185, is a protein involved in intracellular transport and vesicle trafficking. It is known to interact with Rab GTPases, particularly Rab9A, which plays a crucial role in endosomal transport. GCC2 has been identified as a Rab9 effector, meaning it specifically binds to Rab9 in its GTP-bound form, facilitating the tethering of Rab9-positive vesicles to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) (Reddy2006A; Gillingham2019In).

The interaction between GCC2 and Rab9A was confirmed through various experimental methods, including yeast two-hybrid screens and binding assays using His-tagged GCC185 and GST-fused C-terminal residues of GCC185. These studies demonstrated that GCC2 binds specifically to Rab9-GTP, but not to Rab9-GDP, indicating a preference for the active form of Rab9 (Reddy2006A).

GCC2's role as a tethering molecule is further supported by its involvement in the recycling of mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) from late endosomes to the TGN. This process is crucial for maintaining proper MPR localization and function, and GCC2's interaction with Rab9 is essential for this vesicular transport pathway (Reddy2006A).
