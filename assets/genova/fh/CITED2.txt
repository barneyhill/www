# CITED2

## Overview
CITED2 is a gene that encodes the protein Cbp/p300 interacting transactivator with Glu/Asp rich carboxy-terminal domain 2, which functions as a transcriptional co-activator. This protein is involved in various cellular and developmental processes, primarily through its interaction with the transcriptional co-activators p300 and CREB-binding protein (CBP). CITED2 lacks a DNA-binding domain and instead modulates gene expression by interacting with other transcription factors and co-factors, such as hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), and transcription factor AP-2 (TFAP2) isoforms. It plays a crucial role in normal neural tube and cardiac development, as well as in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. Mutations in the CITED2 gene have been associated with congenital heart disease and other developmental abnormalities, highlighting its significance in embryonic development and disease (Tien2004Identification; Bamforth2001Cardiac; Bragança2003Physical).

## Structure
CITED2 is a transcriptional co-activator protein that interacts with the p300/CBP transcriptional coactivator. The CITED2 protein contains a transactivation domain (TAD) that is crucial for its function. This domain, encompassing residues 224-255, binds with high affinity to the CH1 domain of p300, disrupting the interaction between hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and p300 (Freedman2003Structural). The CITED2 TAD forms a compact globular structure when bound to the p300 CH1 domain, wrapping around the CH1 core and covering a large surface area (Freedman2003Structural). The binding involves hydrophobic contacts and salt bridges, contributing to the stability and specificity of the interaction (Freedman2003Structural).

Structurally, the CITED2 TAD includes an α-helix from residues 227 to 235 and a C-terminal 3:10-helix from residues 254 to 256 (Freedman2003Structural). The interaction with p300 is characterized by a conserved 'LPXL' sequence motif, which is essential for binding and is shared with HIF-1α, leading to competition for the CH1 domain (Freedman2003Structural). Mutation of this motif in CITED2 abolishes its ability to bind p300 in vivo (Freedman2003Structural). CITED2 lacks a DNA-binding domain and relies on interactions with other proteins for its function.

## Function
CITED2 is a transcriptional co-activator that plays a significant role in various cellular and developmental processes. It interacts with the transcriptional co-activators and histone acetyltransferases p300/CREB-binding protein (CBP), which are essential for normal neural tube and cardiac development (Bragança2003Physical). CITED2 is necessary for the transactivation of the transcription factor AP-2 (TFAP2) isoforms, which are involved in the expression of target genes such as ErbB3 in the neural crest (Bamforth2001Cardiac). The absence of CITED2 in mice leads to abnormal cardiac, adrenal, neural tube, and cranial ganglia development, indicating its critical role in these processes (Bragança2003Physical).

CITED2 also acts as a coregulator for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), specifically enhancing the transcriptional activity of PPARα and PPARγ, which are involved in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis (Tien2004Identification). It modulates the hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1α) pathway, suggesting a role in a negative feedback loop during hypoxia (Tien2004Identification). CITED2's interaction with PPARs and HIF1α suggests it may influence processes like angiogenesis and cell proliferation (Tien2004Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CITED2 gene have been linked to several congenital conditions, particularly congenital heart disease (CHD). These mutations can disrupt normal protein interactions and gene expression, leading to developmental abnormalities. In the context of CHD, CITED2 mutations have been shown to impair the repression of HIF1A, resulting in increased expression of VEGF, a key factor in vascular development. This alteration is due to weakened interactions between CITED2 and p300CH1, and enhanced interactions between p300CH1 and HIF1A, which increase VEGF transcriptional activity (Liu2014Variations).

CITED2 mutations also affect the transcriptional activation of PITX2C, a gene crucial for cardiac left-right patterning, by impairing its coactivation with TFAP2C. This results in decreased transcriptional activity, contributing to heart malformations (Liu2014Variations). In addition, mutations in CITED2 have been associated with non-familial CHD in pediatric patients, where they lead to frameshifts and truncated proteins, affecting the EP300-binding domain essential for heart development (Dianatpour2019Novel).

CITED2 is also involved in left-right patterning through the nodal-Pitx2c pathway. Deficiencies in CITED2 can lead to cardiovascular malformations, such as atrioventricular septation defects and aortic arch remodeling issues, due to the loss of Pitx2c expression (Bamforth2004Cited2). These findings underscore the critical role of CITED2 in heart development and its potential impact on congenital heart defects.

## Interactions
CITED2 is a transcriptional co-regulator that interacts with various proteins, influencing gene transcription. It does not have a DNA binding domain but can interact with transcription factors and co-factors such as LIM homeobox 2, TFAP2, SMAD2/3, PPAR-γ, oestrogen receptor, MYC, Nucleolin, and p300/CBP (An2020Role). CITED2 interacts with the CH1 domain of transcriptional co-activators CBP/p300, competing with hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) for binding to this domain, thereby inhibiting HIF-1α-dependent transcription (Fernandes2020CITED2). It can displace p300/CBP from HIF-1α, negatively regulating HIF-1α, which is crucial for cellular responses to hypoxia (An2020Role; Yoon2011CITED2).

CITED2 acts as a co-activator for TFAP2, SMAD2/3, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, while it represses transcription by interfering with the binding of factors such as HIF-1α and STAT2 to CBP/p300 (Fernandes2020CITED2). It is necessary for the interaction between TFAP2A and p300, as co-transfection with CITED2 significantly increases reporter activity, indicating an interaction (Bragança2003Physical). CITED2 also interacts with the first helix of the TFAP2 dimerization motif, facilitating the interaction between TFAP2A and p300 (Bragança2003Physical).
