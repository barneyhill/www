# MAP2K3

## Overview
MAP2K3 is a gene that encodes the protein mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3 (MAP2K3), a dual-specificity kinase involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. This kinase plays a pivotal role in cellular responses to stress and inflammation by specifically phosphorylating and activating p38 MAPK isoforms, such as p38α and p38β (Kyriakis2012Mammalian). MAP2K3 is integral to various biological processes, including embryonic development, immune response, and cellular senescence. It is also implicated in the regulation of cytokine production and cell proliferation, with significant roles in both normal physiology and disease states, such as cancer and cardiovascular disorders (Li2017Cardiac; Jia2010Proteome). The protein's interactions with other cellular components underscore its importance in complex signaling networks, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in diseases where these pathways are dysregulated (Zhang2021The).

## Structure
The MAP2K3 protein, also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3, is involved in the MAPK signaling pathway, specifically targeting the p38 MAPK isoforms. Due to the absence of an experimentally determined 3D structure, homology modeling was used to predict its structure. The protein's 3D model includes 21 helix-helix interactions, 18 β turns, 2 sheets, 2 γ turns, 5 β hairpins, 5 β bulges, 8 strands, and 14 α helices, indicating a complex secondary structure (Bhargavi2020Homology).

The active site of MAP2K3 was identified using computational tools, revealing key residues such as Ala74, Asp148, Lys149, Arg152, Lys192, Lys221, Gly226, Cys227, and Tyr230, which are crucial for ligand binding (Bhargavi2020Homology). These residues were used to generate a grid for virtual screening of potential inhibitors, highlighting the importance of the active site in drug design (Bhargavi2020Homology).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are common in MAP2K3, affecting its activity and stability. Mutations in the kinase domain, such as R65L and R67W, have been identified in certain diseases, impacting the protein's stability and function (AyalaMarin2021Quadruple). These mutations can lead to altered protein folding and degradation, affecting the MAPK p38 signaling pathway (AyalaMarin2021Quadruple).

## Function
MAP2K3, also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3, is a dual-specificity kinase that plays a critical role in the MAPK signaling pathway. It specifically phosphorylates and activates p38 MAPK isoforms, particularly p38α and p38β, which are involved in cellular responses to stress and inflammation (Kyriakis2012Mammalian). This activation is crucial for various cellular processes, including the regulation of embryonic angiogenesis and cardiovascular development through the activation of transcription factors like MEF2C (Kyriakis2012Mammalian).

In the immune system, MAP2K3 is essential for the production of interleukin-12 (IL-12) by macrophages and dendritic cells, which promotes the differentiation of naive T cells into T helper 1 (TH1) cells. This process is vital for the proinflammatory immune response. Disruption of MAP2K3 impairs IL-12 production and reduces the differentiation of naive T cells, highlighting its role in immune function and cytokine production (Kyriakis2012Mammalian).

MAP2K3 also influences cellular senescence, particularly in human breast epithelial cells. It is identified as a senescence-promoting protein, with its expression being downregulated in breast cancer. Overexpression of MAP2K3 leads to increased senescence markers, suggesting its role in regulating cell proliferation and senescence through pathways involving p53, p38, and pRB (Jia2010Proteome).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MAP2K3 gene have been implicated in various diseases. In human breast cancer, MAP2K3 is downregulated, which may be an early event in carcinogenic transformation. This downregulation is consistent across different cancer gradations and receptor statuses, suggesting that MAP2K3 could serve as a potential marker for early detection of immortalized cells in cancer (Jia2010Proteome). The study by Jia et al. also indicates that MAP2K3 plays a role in the transition from immortalization to senescence in human breast epithelial cells, and its reduced expression is associated with cancer progression (Jia2010Proteome).

In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), mutations in MAP2K3, such as R26T, P11T, R65L, R67W, and a truncated mutant Q73*, lead to increased degradation and reduced expression of MEK3. These mutations disrupt the MEK3/p38 signaling pathway, promoting proliferative signals in ALL, and suggest that MEK3 could be a therapeutic target for treating this leukemia (AyalaMarin2021Quadruple).

In cardiac fibroblasts, MAP2K3 is involved in the p38 MAPK signaling pathway, which is linked to fibrosis and hypertrophy. The suppression of MAP2K3 by activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is associated with cardioprotection, indicating its potential role in heart failure and hypertensive cardiac remodeling (Li2017Cardiac).

## Interactions
MAP2K3, also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3, is involved in several protein interactions that play crucial roles in cellular signaling pathways. It is known to activate MAPK14 (p38α) through T-loop phosphorylation, which is a key step in the MAPK signaling module (Varjosalo2013The). MAP2K3 also interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2, facilitating the degradation of STAT3, a process that is crucial for regulating cell proliferation and invasion in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (Zhang2021The). This interaction involves the ubiquitination of STAT3, leading to its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Zhang2021The).

In the context of cancer, MAP2K3 has been identified as a senescence-promoting protein, interacting with components of the p53 and p38 pathways, which are involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and the transition from immortalization to senescence in human breast epithelial cells (Jia2010Proteome). Additionally, MAP2K3 is noted to interact with growth factors such as FGFR4 and EPHA2, which are significant in cancer biology (Ivanov2017The). These interactions highlight MAP2K3's role in complex regulatory networks that influence cellular responses to stress and inflammation.
