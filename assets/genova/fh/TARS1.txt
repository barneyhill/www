# TARS1

## Overview
Threonyl-tRNA synthetase 1 (TARS1) is a gene that encodes the enzyme threonyl-tRNA synthetase, which is crucial for protein synthesis. This enzyme belongs to the class of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which are responsible for attaching specific amino acids to their corresponding tRNA molecules, a process essential for translating genetic information into functional proteins. TARS1 is ubiquitously expressed in human cells and plays a vital role in maintaining cellular function and protein homeostasis. Beyond its canonical role in protein synthesis, TARS1 is involved in various non-canonical functions, including angiogenesis and cancer progression, where it acts as an extracellular signaling molecule. Mutations in the TARS1 gene are linked to several human diseases, such as trichothiodystrophy, and its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Gui2023Clinical; Williams2013Secreted; Jiang2020Human; Kuo2020Ubiquitously).

## Structure
TARS1, or threonyl-tRNA synthetase 1, is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by attaching threonine to its corresponding tRNA. The molecular structure of TARS1 includes a Rossmann fold, which is essential for ATP binding, a critical step in the aminoacylation process. This fold is a common structural motif found in proteins that bind nucleotides, indicating its importance in the enzyme's function. Additionally, TARS1 contains an anticodon-binding domain, which is responsible for recognizing and binding to the tRNA molecule, ensuring the correct amino acid is attached.

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may occur in TARS1, potentially affecting its activity or interactions with other molecules. These modifications can play a role in regulating the enzyme's function and stability. TARS1 also exhibits variability through alternative splicing, leading to different isoforms of the protein. These splice variants may have distinct functional properties or regulatory roles, contributing to the enzyme's versatility in cellular processes. The combination of these structural features and modifications underscores the complexity and adaptability of TARS1 in its role in protein synthesis.

## Function
Threonyl-tRNA synthetase 1 (TARS1) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of the amino acid threonine to its corresponding tRNA. This process, known as aminoacylation, is essential for the accurate translation of the genetic code into proteins, ensuring that proteins are synthesized correctly according to the genetic instructions (Jiang2020Human; Kuo2020Ubiquitously). TARS1 operates in the cytoplasm of human cells, where it is ubiquitously expressed and vital for maintaining cellular function and protein homeostasis (Kuo2020Ubiquitously).

In healthy human cells, TARS1 is involved in the charging of tRNA with threonine, a critical step in protein translation. This function is particularly important in tissues with high demands for protein synthesis, such as the central nervous system, liver, and lungs (Jiang2020Human). The enzyme's activity is essential for the proper functioning of keratinized tissues like hair and nails, as these tissues are sensitive to impaired tRNA charging with threonine (Kuo2020Ubiquitously). TARS1 also plays a role in the regulation of certain mRNAs, including those involved in angiogenesis, through its interactions with translation initiation factors (Sung2022Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TARS1 gene are associated with several human diseases, primarily affecting multiple systems. Bi-allelic mutations in TARS1 can lead to trichothiodystrophy, a condition characterized by brittle hair and nails, developmental delays, anemia, and respiratory distress. These mutations often result in multi-system diseases impacting organs such as the brain, liver, and lungs, with neurological disorders frequently affecting children under one year of age (Jiang2020Human).

Research using model organisms has identified specific TARS1 mutations, such as R433H and G541R, which result in developmental delays and respiratory deficiencies. In mice, the R433H mutation combined with a null allele leads to neonatal lethality due to lung defects, highlighting the mutation's severe impact on respiratory function (MeyerSchuman2024Predictive).

In cancer, TARS1 is overexpressed in several malignancies, including breast and ovarian cancers. In breast cancer, high TARS1 expression is linked to poor prognosis and increased infiltration of pro-tumor immune cells, suggesting its role as an oncogene and potential biomarker for immunotherapy efficacy (Gui2023Clinical). In ovarian cancer, TARS1 overexpression correlates with disease progression and angiogenic markers, indicating its involvement in tumor growth and the tumor microenvironment (Wellman2014ThreonyltRNA).

## Interactions
Threonyl-tRNA synthetase 1 (TARS1) is known for its role in protein synthesis, where it catalyzes the attachment of threonine to its corresponding tRNA. Beyond this canonical function, TARS1 has been implicated in various non-canonical interactions, particularly in the context of angiogenesis and cancer progression. TARS1 is secreted in response to inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and it stimulates endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis, suggesting its role as an extracellular signaling molecule (Williams2013Secreted).

TARS1 interacts with other proteins and nucleic acids in the multi-synthetase complex, which includes various aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. This complex is involved in translation regulation and may facilitate interactions with RNA molecules (Williams2013Secreted). Inhibitory interactions have been observed with compounds like borrelidin (BN) and its derivative BC194, which target TARS1 and inhibit its pro-angiogenic properties. These inhibitors interact with the TARS1 active site, affecting its function and leading to reduced angiogenesis (Mirando2015AminoacyltRNA).

TARS1's role in angiogenesis is further supported by its involvement in endothelial cell migration and its secretion in response to VEGF, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases characterized by angiogenic responses (Williams2013Secreted).
