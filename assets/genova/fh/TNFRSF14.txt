# TNFRSF14

## Overview
TNFRSF14, also known as the Herpesvirus Entry Mediator (HVEM), is a gene that encodes a type I transmembrane protein belonging to the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. The protein, TNF receptor superfamily member 14, plays a crucial role in immune regulation by modulating the activation and proliferation of various immune cells, including B and T lymphocytes, and dendritic cells. It is characterized by its extracellular cysteine-rich domains (CRDs), which facilitate interactions with both conventional ligands, such as LIGHT and LT-α, and non-conventional ligands, including BTLA and CD160. These interactions can lead to diverse immune responses, ranging from activation to inhibition, depending on the context. TNFRSF14 is implicated in several physiological and pathological processes, including inflammation, immune homeostasis, and cancer progression, making it a significant target for therapeutic interventions (Sibilano2016A; Šedý2019HVEM; Vanamee2020On).

## Structure
TNFRSF14, also known as HVEM, is a type I transmembrane protein that is part of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. The protein's extracellular domain contains cysteine-rich domains (CRDs), which are crucial for ligand binding. These CRDs are involved in interactions with TNF superfamily ligands such as LIGHT and LT-α, as well as non-conventional ligands like BTLA and CD160 (Vanamee2020On). The extracellular region of TNFRSF14 is characterized by three CRDs, which are common structural motifs in TNF receptors and are involved in the formation of ligand-receptor complexes (Wu2022Molecular).

The protein lacks a transmembrane domain in some species, such as the spotted gar, suggesting it may be secreted in these cases (Wu2022Molecular). However, in humans, TNFRSF14 typically includes a single transmembrane helix. The cytoplasmic tail of TNFRSF14 interacts with signaling molecules, facilitating downstream signaling pathways (Vanamee2020On).

Post-translational modifications of TNFRSF14 include glycosylation, which is common among TNF receptor family members and may influence protein stability and function (Vanamee2020On). The protein can form homotrimers, a typical quaternary structure for members of the TNF receptor family, which is essential for its function in signaling (Vanamee2020On).

## Function
TNFRSF14, also known as HVEM (Herpesvirus Entry Mediator), is a receptor in the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily that plays a significant role in immune regulation. It is involved in modulating the activation of B and T lymphocytes, promoting dendritic cell proliferation, and protecting mucosal epithelia from damage during inflammation (Vanamee2020On). TNFRSF14 interacts with several TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) homologs, including TRAF2, to induce NFκB activation, a key pathway in immune response regulation (Vanamee2020On).

The receptor is activated by canonical TNFSF ligands such as LIGHT (TNFSF14) and LT-α, and is modulated by non-conventional ligands like BTLA and CD160. These interactions can lead to either stimulatory or inhibitory immune responses, impacting inflammation and immune homeostasis (Vanamee2020On). TNFRSF14 is active at the cell membrane, where it can form complexes with its ligands and regulatory proteins, influencing the nature and magnitude of immune responses (Vanamee2020On).

In the context of mast cells, TNFRSF14 enhances IgE-dependent activation, contributing to the production of pro-inflammatory mediators and playing a role in conditions such as asthma (Sibilano2016A). This receptor's engagement is crucial for the full development of immune responses, highlighting its importance in both normal immune function and disease pathology (Sibilano2016A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TNFRSF14 gene, also known as HVEM, have significant clinical implications, particularly in hematological malignancies. In follicular lymphoma (FL), TNFRSF14 mutations are associated with poor prognosis and are linked to high-risk clinical features such as poor performance status and involvement of multiple extranodal sites (Cheung2010Acquired). These mutations are also correlated with inferior overall survival and disease-specific survival in patients treated with rituximab (Cheung2010Acquired). High expression of TNFRSF14 is associated with poor overall survival and progression-free survival in FL, and it increases the risk of transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (Carreras2019High).

In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, TNFRSF14 mutations and high expression levels are linked to poor prognosis and shorter time-to-treatment (SordoBahamonde2023Beyond). The loss of HVEM function can enhance antitumor responses by making tumor cells more susceptible to immune attacks, as seen in leukemia B cell lines where HVEM deficiency leads to increased T cell infiltration and improved tumor control (del2023Genetic). These findings highlight the potential of targeting TNFRSF14 in therapeutic strategies for hematological cancers.

## Interactions
TNFRSF14, also known as HVEM, is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily and engages in various interactions with other proteins, influencing immune responses and cancer progression. HVEM interacts with several ligands, including LIGHT (TNFSF14), LTα, BTLA, and CD160, which play roles in modulating immune cell behavior. These interactions can either stimulate or inhibit immune responses depending on the context. For instance, HVEM can activate NF-κB signaling through TRAF2 recruitment when engaged by LIGHT, while its interaction with BTLA typically results in inhibitory signaling, affecting T cell activation (Cheung2005Evolutionarily; Šedý2019HVEM).

In the context of cancer, HVEM's interaction with BTLA is particularly significant. In lymphomas, HVEM activation of BTLA receptors negatively regulates tumor-reactive T cells, contributing to immune evasion by the tumor (Šedý2019HVEM). Additionally, HVEM can form cis-complexes with BTLA and CD160 on T cells, which inhibit HVEM trans-activation by its ligands, maintaining peripheral tolerance in naive T cells (Cheung2009T).

HVEM also interacts with viral proteins, such as the herpes simplex virus 1 glycoprotein D (gD), which can inhibit the binding of both LIGHT and BTLA, potentially disrupting immune signaling pathways (Cheung2005Evolutionarily). These interactions highlight HVEM's role as a molecular switch, capable of mediating both stimulatory and inhibitory signals in immune regulation.
