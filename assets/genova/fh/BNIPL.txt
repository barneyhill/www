# BNIPL

## Overview
BNIPL (BCL2 interacting protein like) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of apoptosis and cell proliferation, processes essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. The protein encoded by BNIPL is categorized as an apoptosis-associated protein and is known to interact with several key proteins, including macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and growth factor erv1-like (GFER), which are related to cell proliferation (Shen2003The). These interactions suggest that the BNIPL protein plays a critical role in linking apoptosis and cell proliferation pathways, thereby preventing the survival and expansion of aberrant cells that could lead to diseases such as cancer and autoimmune disorders (Shen2003The; Low1999Tyrosine). The gene is highly expressed in human placenta and lung tissues, indicating its potential involvement in tissue-specific functions (Shen2003The). Mutations and alterations in BNIPL have been implicated in various diseases, including cancers and severe tick-borne encephalitis, highlighting its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Määttä2016Wholeexome; Ignatieva2019Exomewide).

## Function
BNIPL (BCL2 interacting protein like) is an apoptosis-associated protein that plays a significant role in regulating the balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis, crucial processes for maintaining cellular homeostasis and normal development. BNIPL interacts with cell proliferation-related proteins such as macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and growth factor erv1-like (GFER), as confirmed by yeast two-hybrid system, glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay, and co-immunoprecipitation assay (Shen2003The). These interactions suggest that BNIPL may serve as a link between apoptosis and cell proliferation pathways, helping to prevent the survival and expansion of aberrant cells, which could lead to cancer or autoimmune diseases (Shen2003The).

BNIPL is highly expressed in human placenta and lung tissues, indicating its potential involvement in tissue-specific functions (Shen2003The). The protein is localized in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with MIF and GFER, suggesting that its regulatory functions occur in this cellular compartment (Shen2003The). Through its interactions and expression patterns, BNIPL contributes to the regulation of cellular responses to stress and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the BNIPL gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. BNIPL is involved in the regulation of apoptosis and cell proliferation, processes that are often disrupted in cancer. In hepatocellular carcinoma, BNIPL promotes invasion and metastasis, suggesting its role in cancer progression (Määttä2016Wholeexome). Additionally, a frameshift variant in BNIPL has been identified in Finnish hereditary breast cancer families, indicating a potential link to breast cancer susceptibility (Määttä2016Wholeexome).

BNIPL has also been associated with severe tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) in a Russian population. The gene's involvement in apoptosis regulation is thought to contribute to the host response to the tick-borne encephalitis virus, which can induce programmed cell death (Ignatieva2019Exomewide). Furthermore, BNIPL has been linked to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), with genetic variants in BNIPL associated with treatment-free survival outcomes in CLL patients (Mosquera2019The).

These findings underscore the clinical significance of BNIPL in various diseases, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in conditions where apoptosis and cell proliferation are dysregulated.

## Interactions
BNIPL, also known as Bcl-2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa interacting protein 2-like, is involved in several protein interactions that play a role in apoptosis and cell proliferation. BNIPL interacts with macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and growth factor erv1-like (GFER), both of which are related to cell proliferation. These interactions were identified using a yeast two-hybrid system and confirmed through glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation assays. The interactions suggest that BNIPL may inhibit the growth of BEL-7402 cells, indicating its potential role in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis (Shen2003The).

BNIPL is also associated with the Bcl-2 protein, a key regulator of apoptosis, influencing cell survival. It interacts with Cdc42 and RhoA, which are involved in cytoskeletal organization and cell signaling pathways. These interactions highlight BNIPL's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential involvement in diseases such as cancer and autoimmune disorders (Low1999Tyrosine). The interactions of BNIPL with these proteins underscore its significance in the balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis.
