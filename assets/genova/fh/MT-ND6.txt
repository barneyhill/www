# MT-ND6

## Overview
The MT-ND6 gene is a mitochondrial gene that encodes the protein mitochondrially encoded NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit 6, a crucial component of Complex I in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This transmembrane protein is integral to the inner mitochondrial membrane and plays a vital role in the initial stages of electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone, contributing to the generation of a proton gradient necessary for ATP synthesis through oxidative phosphorylation. The MT-ND6 protein is essential for the structural integrity and functional capacity of Complex I, facilitating efficient cellular respiration and energy production. Mutations in the MT-ND6 gene can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and are associated with various mitochondrial disorders, including Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) and Leigh syndrome, underscoring its importance in cellular energy metabolism and mitochondrial health (Mukherjee2020Molecular; Bai1998The).

## Structure
The MT-ND6 gene encodes a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, which is crucial for the electron transport chain and energy production. The protein is involved in the assembly and maintenance of complex I, contributing to its structural integrity and function. The MT-ND6 protein is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and is characterized by its hydrophobic nature, which is typical for proteins embedded in the membrane (PeralesClemente2010Allotopic; Uehara2014New).

The primary structure of MT-ND6 includes several conserved amino acid residues, such as proline at position 79, which is critical for its function. Mutations at this site, such as the m.14439G>A mutation, result in a proline to serine change, affecting the protein's role in complex I (Uehara2014New). The secondary structure of MT-ND6 involves transmembrane helices, which are essential for its integration into the mitochondrial membrane (Ugalde2003Impaired).

The tertiary structure of MT-ND6 is shaped by its interaction with other subunits of complex I, forming part of the membrane arm that is involved in proton translocation. This interaction is crucial for the quaternary structure of complex I, ensuring efficient electron transfer and ATP synthesis (Zhuang2010ND6).

## Function
The MT-ND6 gene encodes a subunit of the mitochondrial NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, also known as Complex I, which is a crucial component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This enzyme complex is responsible for the initial step of the electron transport chain, facilitating the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone. This process is essential for the generation of a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane, which drives ATP synthesis through oxidative phosphorylation (Bai1998The).

The ND6 subunit, encoded by mitochondrial DNA, is integral to the assembly and stability of the membrane arm of Complex I. It plays a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity and functional capacity of the enzyme complex, which is vital for efficient cellular respiration and energy production (Bai1998The). The ND6 subunit is active within the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it contributes to the electron-transfer and proton-pumping activities necessary for ATP production (Bai1998The).

Mutations in the MT-ND6 gene can disrupt the assembly and function of Complex I, leading to impaired oxidative phosphorylation and associated mitochondrial diseases, highlighting the gene's importance in cellular energy metabolism (Bai1998The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MT-ND6 gene are associated with several mitochondrial disorders, most notably Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) and Leigh syndrome (LS). LHON is characterized by acute or subacute loss of central vision due to optic nerve degeneration. Several mutations in the MT-ND6 gene, such as m.14484T>C (p.M64V), m.14459G>A (p.A72V), and m.14498T>C (p.Y59C), have been linked to LHON, with varying degrees of visual recovery and complex I activity (Carelli1999Biochemical; Pätsi2007Leber). These mutations often affect the interaction of complex I with ubiquinone, altering its function without significantly decreasing its activity (Carelli1999Biochemical).

Leigh syndrome, a severe neurological disorder, is also associated with mutations in MT-ND6. The m.14597A>G variant, which causes a p.Ile26Thr alteration, is linked to LS when present at high heteroplasmy levels, leading to significant mitochondrial dysfunction, including reduced ATP production and oxygen consumption (Kishita2021A). This variant is considered more harmful than other p.Ile26 variants due to its impact on the ND6 protein structure (Kishita2021A). These mutations highlight the critical role of MT-ND6 in maintaining mitochondrial function and its involvement in mitochondrial pathologies.

## Interactions
MT-ND6 is a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which is a large multi-subunit transmembrane protein complex involved in electron transfer and proton translocation. MT-ND6 interacts with other subunits of complex I, contributing to its assembly and function. Specifically, MT-ND6, along with MT-ND3 and MT-ND4L, binds to the ND2 module, which is part of the larger complex I assembly process (Mukherjee2020Molecular). This interaction is crucial for the proper assembly and maintenance of complex I, which is essential for mitochondrial respiratory function.

Mutations in MT-ND6 have been linked to mitochondrial disorders such as Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) and Leigh syndrome (LS), highlighting the importance of its interactions within the respiratory chain complex (Mukherjee2020Molecular). The MT-ND6 gene is also a hotspot for mutations associated with these disorders, indicating its critical role in maintaining mitochondrial function (Uehara2014New). The interactions of MT-ND6 within complex I are essential for the electron transport chain's efficiency and the overall bioenergetics of the cell.
