# PFKL

## Overview
The PFKL gene encodes the liver-type isoform of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1), a critical enzyme in the glycolytic pathway. As a kinase, PFKL catalyzes the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, a key regulatory step in glucose metabolism that commits glucose to glycolysis. This enzyme is predominantly expressed in the liver and plays a vital role in energy production and metabolic regulation. PFKL is unique among PFK1 isoforms due to its ability to form filamentous structures, which may enhance its catalytic efficiency and regulatory functions. These filaments are influenced by metabolic conditions and may support various cellular processes, including energy homeostasis and cellular responses to oxidative stress (Webb2017The). The gene's expression and interactions are implicated in several clinical contexts, including cancer and genetic disorders, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Elson1994Overexpression; Zhou2022A).

## Structure
The human phosphofructokinase, liver type (PFKL), is a tetrameric enzyme involved in glycolysis. Its primary structure consists of 779 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 85,146 daltons, although gel electrophoresis suggests a slightly smaller size of 80 kD (LEVANON1989The). The gene encoding PFKL spans at least 28 kb and is divided into 22 exons (LEVANON1989The).

PFKL's quaternary structure is characterized by the formation of tetramers, which can further assemble into filaments. These filaments are composed of stacked tetramers with specific interactions at the assembly interfaces, which are crucial for filament formation (Webb2017The). The tetramer has D2 symmetry, with three perpendicular twofold symmetry axes, and the assembly interactions differ between the two dimers that make up the tetramer, indicating asymmetry in the assembly interfaces (Webb2017The).

PFKL undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which can regulate its activity (LEVANON1989The). The enzyme's regulatory domain is implicated in mediating filament assembly, and its activity is influenced by various allosteric ligands and post-translational modifications (Lynch2024Structural). The enzyme can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, contributing to its diverse regulatory mechanisms (LEVANON1989The).

## Function
PFKL encodes the liver-type isoform of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1), a key regulatory enzyme in glycolysis. PFKL catalyzes the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, a critical step in glucose metabolism that commits glucose to the glycolytic pathway (Webb2017The; Mor2011Control). This enzyme is active in the cytoplasm and plays a crucial role in energy production by influencing cellular ATP levels and metabolic pathways, thereby impacting overall energy homeostasis in the organism (Webb2017The).

PFKL is unique among PFK1 isoforms in its ability to assemble into filamentous structures within cells. These filaments are composed of stacked tetramers with exposed catalytic sites, suggesting a spatial organization that may enhance catalytic efficiency (Webb2017The). The formation of these filaments is substrate-dependent and influenced by metabolic conditions, such as the presence of citrate, which can induce the formation of large PFKL-positive structures (Webb2017The). These filaments may play roles in scaffolding, regulated activity, efficient substrate transfer, and localized ATP production, potentially supporting cellular processes like protrusion, endocytosis, and ATP-dependent ion transport near the plasma membrane (Webb2017The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and interaction of the PFKL gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer and genetic disorders. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the m6A binding protein YTHDF3 promotes the expression of PFKL at both mRNA and protein levels, enhancing glycolysis and contributing to cancer progression. This interaction is crucial for the metabolic reprogramming observed in HCC, where cancer cells shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis to support rapid growth and survival. High expression levels of both YTHDF3 and PFKL are associated with poorer survival outcomes in HCC patients, indicating that alterations in PFKL expression, influenced by YTHDF3, are linked to the progression and metabolic reprogramming of HCC (Zhou2022A).

PFKL overexpression is also relevant in the context of Down syndrome (trisomy 21), where the gene is triplicated, leading to increased phosphofructokinase activity. This overexpression is believed to disrupt normal biochemical processes, contributing to the symptoms of Down syndrome. Studies using transgenic mice have shown that PFKL overexpression can lead to increased enzymatic activity in tissues where it is normally abundant, such as the liver, which may contribute to some of the metabolic abnormalities seen in Down syndrome (Elson1994Overexpression).

## Interactions
PFKL (phosphofructokinase, liver type) participates in several interactions with other proteins that influence its function in glycolysis and cellular metabolism. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PFKL interacts with YTHDF3, a YTH domain family protein, which enhances PFKL expression at both mRNA and protein levels through m6A modification, thereby promoting glycolysis. This interaction forms a positive feedback loop where PFKL also regulates YTHDF3 expression (Zhou2022A).

PFKL is also stabilized by DNAAF5 in HCC through the recruitment of USP39, a deubiquitination protein. This interaction prevents PFKL degradation, enhancing its stability and promoting glycolysis, which contributes to cancer progression (Liu2022DNAAF5).

Additionally, PFKL interacts with A20, a protein that negatively regulates PFKL levels through ubiquitination, impacting glucose metabolism and inhibiting tumor growth in HCC (Feng2020A20).

PFKL also shows a preference for interacting with oxidized methionine in actin-derived peptides, suggesting a role in cellular responses to oxidative stress (Maurais2022A). These interactions highlight PFKL's involvement in various regulatory pathways beyond its enzymatic role in glycolysis.
