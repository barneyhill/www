# GC

## Overview
The GC gene encodes the vitamin D binding protein (DBP), a multifunctional serum protein that plays a critical role in the transport and regulation of vitamin D and its metabolites in the human body. As a member of the albumin and alpha-fetoprotein gene family, DBP is characterized by its α-helical structure, which facilitates its binding to vitamin D metabolites, such as 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, thereby ensuring their bioavailability and stability in circulation (Verboven2002A; Cooke1991Vitamin). Beyond its primary function in vitamin D transport, DBP is involved in the extracellular actin scavenger system, preventing actin polymerization and maintaining vascular integrity during tissue damage (Delanghe2015Behind; Bouillon2020Vitamin). Additionally, DBP influences immune responses by interacting with complement-derived peptides and binding fatty acids, underscoring its diverse physiological roles (Kew1988Gcglobulin; Bouillon2020Vitamin). Variations in the GC gene have been linked to several health conditions, including osteoporosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and autoimmune disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (RiveraParedez2021Association; Janssens2009Vitamin).

## Structure
The GC vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) is a multifunctional serum protein with a complex molecular structure. It consists of a single polypeptide chain and is part of the albumin and alpha-fetoprotein gene family, sharing structural similarities with these proteins (Cooke1991Vitamin). The primary structure of DBP includes three homologous α-helical domains, with domains I and II further subdivided into subdomains. Domain III is shorter compared to its homolog in human serum albumin (Otterbein2002Crystal).

The secondary structure of DBP is predominantly α-helical, forming a globular shape in its tertiary structure. This configuration allows DBP to bind vitamin D3 ligands, with the binding site located in the N-terminal part of domain I (Verboven2002A). The protein's unique folding, particularly in domain I, facilitates its specific binding properties (Verboven2002A).

DBP undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which can affect its binding properties. The protein also exists in several splice variant isoforms, influencing its function and distribution (Cooke1991Vitamin). These structural features enable DBP to perform its roles in vitamin D transport and actin scavenging effectively.

## Function
The GC gene encodes the vitamin D binding protein (DBP), which plays a crucial role in the transport and solubilization of vitamin D and its metabolites in the bloodstream. DBP binds to vitamin D metabolites such as 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D), ensuring their availability to tissues and maintaining a stable supply of these metabolites (Delanghe2015Behind; Chun2012New). This binding prolongs the half-life of vitamin D metabolites by reducing their hepatic metabolism and excretion (Speeckaert2006Biological).

DBP also participates in the extracellular actin scavenger system, binding to monomeric actin with high affinity to prevent the formation of polymerized actin fibrils, which can cause coagulation issues (Delanghe2015Behind; Bouillon2020Vitamin). This function is particularly important during tissue damage and cell death, as it helps maintain vascular integrity (Delanghe2015Behind).

In addition to its role in vitamin D and actin transport, DBP has been implicated in immune response modulation, binding to fatty acids and endotoxins, and influencing T cell response (Delanghe2015Behind; Bouillon2020Vitamin). These diverse functions highlight DBP's importance in various physiological processes, including bone metabolism and immune function.

## Clinical Significance
The GC gene, encoding the vitamin D binding protein (DBP), is associated with various diseases and conditions due to its polymorphisms and altered expression. Variants in the GC gene, such as rs7041 and rs4588, have been linked to differences in vitamin D metabolite levels, influencing conditions like osteoporosis and bone mineral density (BMD) variations. For instance, the GC2 haplotype is associated with lower serum VDBP concentrations and reduced BMD, particularly in postmenopausal women, which may increase the risk of osteoporotic fractures (RiveraParedez2021Association).

In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the rs7041 T allele is associated with reduced 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and increased disease risk, suggesting a genetic link between GC variants and COPD severity (Janssens2009Vitamin). The GC gene polymorphisms have also been implicated in autoimmune thyroid disorders, such as Graves' disease, but not in Hashimoto's thyroiditis (Speeckaert2006Biological).

The GC gene's role extends to diabetes, with some studies indicating an association between its polymorphisms and type 2 diabetes, although findings are inconsistent (Speeckaert2006Biological; Bikle2019Vitamin). These genetic variations highlight the clinical significance of the GC gene in various health conditions.

## Interactions
The GC gene encodes the vitamin D binding protein (DBP), which participates in several significant physical interactions with other proteins. DBP binds to actin with high affinity, forming a complex that prevents actin polymerization in the bloodstream, which could otherwise lead to microcirculation clogging. This DBP-actin complex is rapidly cleared from circulation, highlighting its role in mitigating damage caused by actin polymerization (Speeckaert2006Biological; Chun2012New; Bouillon2020Vitamin). The interaction involves all three domains of DBP, providing a large surface area of contact with actin (Chun2012New).

DBP also interacts with complement-derived peptides, specifically enhancing the chemotactic activity of C5a and C5a des Arg. This interaction involves the formation of a 1:1 complex, which enhances the chemotactic response of neutrophils, playing a role in immune response modulation (Kew1988Gcglobulin).

Additionally, DBP can bind fatty acids, although its role in fatty acid transport is secondary to albumin. The presence of fatty acids can impair the binding of vitamin D metabolites to DBP, indicating a competitive interaction (Chun2012New; Bouillon2020Vitamin).
