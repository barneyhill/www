# MOB3C

## Overview
MOB3C is a gene that encodes the MOB kinase activator 3C protein, a member of the MOB family of proteins. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including RNA biology and apoptotic signaling. MOB kinase activator 3C is particularly notable for its interactions with the RNase P complex, a ribonucleoprotein complex essential for tRNA processing, suggesting a role in regulating the catalytic activity or substrate specificity of RNase P (Elkholi2023Mapping). Additionally, it is associated with the mitochondrial RNase P (MRP) complex, indicating a role in ribosomal biogenesis and tRNA processing (Elkholi2023Mapping). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing cell growth and development (Gundogdu2019MOB). MOB3C is also involved in apoptotic signaling through its interaction with MST1, a kinase in the Hippo signaling pathway, suggesting a regulatory role in apoptosis (Gundogdu2019MOB). Despite its structural similarities to other MOB proteins, MOB3C has evolved distinct functions, particularly in RNA processing and potentially in the DNA damage response (Gundogdu2019MOB).

## Function
MOB3C is a member of the MOB family of proteins, which are involved in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, MOB3C is implicated in RNA biology through its interaction with the RNase P complex, a ribonucleoprotein complex essential for tRNA processing. This interaction suggests that MOB3C may regulate the catalytic activity or substrate specificity of RNase P, potentially acting as an adaptor in assembling the RNase P holoenzyme (Elkholi2023Mapping). 

MOB3C is also associated with the mitochondrial RNase P (MRP) complex, indicating a role in ribosomal biogenesis and tRNA processing (Elkholi2023Mapping). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing cell growth and development (Gundogdu2019MOB). 

Additionally, MOB3C is involved in apoptotic signaling through its interaction with MST1, a kinase in the Hippo signaling pathway. This interaction suggests a regulatory role in apoptosis, although the specific mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated (Gundogdu2019MOB). Despite its structural similarities to other MOB proteins, MOB3C appears to have evolved distinct functions, particularly in RNA processing and potentially in the DNA damage response (Gundogdu2019MOB).

## Clinical Significance
MOB3C has been implicated in various cancers, including glioblastoma, breast cancer, and colon cancer. In glioblastoma, MOB3C, along with MOB3A and MOB3B, is upregulated, and their combined depletion halts glioblastoma cell proliferation, suggesting a pro-tumorigenic role (Elkholi2023Mapping). In breast cancer cells, the knockdown of hMOB3C decreases cell viability, indicating its involvement in cancer cell survival (Gundogdu2019MOB). Similarly, in colon cancer cells, hMOB3C knockdown shows a negative genetic interaction with the PTEN phosphatase, suggesting a potential role in colon cancer (Gundogdu2019MOB).

MOB3C also interacts uniquely with the RNase P complex, which may influence RNA processing. This interaction is specific to MOB3C due to additional charged residues that facilitate binding, potentially affecting the complex's catalytic activity or substrate specificity (Elkholi2023Mapping). The clinical significance of these interactions is not fully understood, but they suggest that MOB3C may have distinct functions compared to other MOB proteins, with implications for tumorigenesis and RNA biology (Elkholi2023Mapping). Further research is needed to elucidate the full clinical implications of MOB3C's interactions and expression alterations.

## Interactions
MOB3C, a member of the MOB protein family, is involved in several protein interactions, particularly with the RNase P complex. This interaction is unique to MOB3C among the MOB proteins and has been validated through various experimental approaches, including affinity purification-mass spectrometry and pre-tRNA cleavage assays. MOB3C interacts with seven out of ten protein subunits of the RNase P complex, which is involved in tRNA 5' maturation (Elkholi2023Mapping). The interaction suggests that MOB3C may play a role in regulating the catalytic activity or substrate specificity of RNase P, potentially acting as an adaptor in assembling the holoenzyme (Elkholi2023Mapping).

MOB3C also shares interactions with nuclear proteins NOP53 and COIL, which are involved in ribosomal biogenesis and mRNA splicing, respectively. These interactions are shared with MOB3A, another member of the MOB3 subfamily (Elkholi2023Mapping). Despite the high sequence similarity with other MOB3 proteins, MOB3C has evolved distinct functions, possibly due to additional charged residues that facilitate its interaction with RNase P (Elkholi2023Mapping). The study of MOB3C's interactions provides insights into its potential roles beyond the canonical functions associated with MOB proteins.
