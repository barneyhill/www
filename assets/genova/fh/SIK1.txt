# SIK1

## Overview
Salt-inducible kinase 1 (SIK1) is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase protein, which plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including metabolic regulation, gene expression, and apoptosis. The SIK1 protein is involved in the phosphorylation of key substrates, influencing pathways related to glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as the regulation of transcription factors through interactions with class IIa histone deacetylases and cAMP-regulated transcriptional coactivators (Wein2018Salt-Inducible; Sun2020The). SIK1's activity is modulated by phosphorylation events, which are crucial for its function and interaction with other proteins (Hashimoto2008Importance). Clinically, mutations in the SIK1 gene have been linked to neurological disorders such as developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, highlighting its significance in neuronal development and synaptic function (Pröschel2016Epilepsycausing).

## Structure
Salt-inducible kinase 1 (SIK1) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes. The primary structure of SIK1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, including a kinase domain essential for its enzymatic activity (Hashimoto2008Importance). The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and function.

The tertiary structure of SIK1 involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is critical for its function. This structure is stabilized by interactions such as disulfide bonds and is influenced by post-translational modifications like phosphorylation. Phosphorylation at specific sites, such as Ser186 in the activation loop (A-loop), is vital for SIK1's sustained kinase activity. This modification is necessary for the phosphorylation of Thr182, which is mediated by upstream kinases like LKB1 and GSK-3b (Hashimoto2008Importance).

SIK1 also contains an autophosphorylation site within its kinase domain, which is crucial for its activity. This site is conserved between SIK1 and other kinases like SIK2 (Hashimoto2008Importance). The presence of splice variant isoforms may lead to different functional roles within the cell, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
SIK1 (salt-inducible kinase 1) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in the regulation of p53-dependent anoikis, a form of programmed cell death triggered by the loss of cell adhesion. SIK1 is necessary for the phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15, which is essential for p53 activation in response to cellular detachment, thereby promoting apoptosis and preventing metastasis (Cheng2009SIK1).

SIK1 also regulates metabolic homeostasis by influencing glucose and lipid metabolism. It promotes insulin resistance and inhibits glucose uptake in skeletal muscle by phosphorylating insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1). SIK1 knockout mice exhibit improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity due to increased expression of glucose transporters (Sun2020The). In lipid metabolism, SIK1 acts as a negative regulator by repressing lipogenic gene expression (Sun2020The).

In addition, SIK1 is involved in the regulation of gene expression through its interaction with class IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs) and cAMP-regulated transcriptional coactivators (CRTCs). It phosphorylates these factors, promoting their cytoplasmic retention and preventing them from entering the nucleus, thus influencing gene expression and cellular responses to hormonal signals (Wein2018Salt-Inducible).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SIK1 gene are associated with several neurological disorders, most notably developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE-30) and early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE-30). These conditions are characterized by frequent seizures and developmental delays. Specific mutations, such as truncating mutations p.(Glu347*) and p.(Gln633*), lead to decreased expression and activity of the transcription factor MEF2C, which is crucial for neuronal development and synaptic function. This disruption can lower the threshold for clinical seizures, contributing to epilepsy and developmental disorders (Pröschel2016Epilepsycausing).

The missense mutation p.(Pro287Thr) in SIK1 is linked to severe clinical phenotypes, including early-onset infantile epilepsy and abnormal neuronal morphology, such as reduced neurite length and increased proximal branches (Pröschel2016Epilepsycausing). SIK1 mutations also interfere with the effectiveness of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) therapy, a treatment for infantile spasms, indicating that normal SIK1 function is necessary for the therapeutic effects of ACTH (Pang2022An).

Alterations in SIK1 expression can affect synaptic activity response gene expression, leading to imbalances in excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission, which are relevant to epilepsy and autism spectrum disorder symptoms (Pröschel2016Epilepsycausing; Badawi2021Risperidone).

## Interactions
SIK1 (salt inducible kinase 1) is involved in various protein interactions that influence its regulatory functions. It is part of a protein complex with Na,K-ATPase in the renal proximal tubule, where it interacts with proteins such as Salt Inducible Kinase 1 (SIK1), Ca2+/Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 1 (CaMK1), Protein Phosphatase Methylesterase 1 (PME1), and Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A). This complex regulates Na,K-ATPase activity in response to intracellular calcium levels (Taub2018Gene).

SIK1 interacts with 14-3-3 proteins following phosphorylation by PKA, which is crucial for its sensitivity to cAMP and affects its subcellular localization (Zhang2024Role). It also phosphorylates CREB Regulated Transcriptional Coactivators (CRTCs), leading to their sequestration in the cytoplasm by 14-3-3 proteins, thereby inhibiting CREB-mediated transcriptional activation (Taub2018Gene).

SIK1 is involved in the phosphorylation of class IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs), affecting transcriptional activity by causing the dissociation of HDACs from transcription factors like Myocyte-specific-enhancer-factor-2 (MEF2) and Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cells (NFAT) (Taub2018Gene). These interactions highlight SIK1's role in regulating gene expression and cellular signaling pathways.
