# SAMD10

## Overview
SAMD10 is a gene that encodes the protein sterile alpha motif domain containing 10, which is characterized by the presence of a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain. This domain is known for facilitating protein-protein interactions and RNA binding, suggesting that the SAMD10 protein may play a role in posttranscriptional modification processes and cellular signaling pathways (Saito2006The). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cellular growth and differentiation. Although the specific functions of SAMD10 in normal human physiology are not fully understood, its involvement in RNA binding and protein interactions indicates a potential role in regulating gene expression and cellular processes. The gene is located on chromosome 20q13.33 and has been associated with cancer biology, particularly in gallbladder cancer cell lines, highlighting its potential significance in oncological research (Saito2006The).

## Structure


## Function
The SAMD10 gene encodes a protein that contains a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, which is known for its role in mediating protein-protein interactions and RNA binding. This suggests that SAMD10 may be involved in posttranscriptional modification processes, potentially influencing cellular signaling and regulatory pathways (Saito2006The). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it participates in these molecular activities, impacting cellular growth and differentiation. Although the specific functions of SAMD10 in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, its involvement in protein interactions and RNA binding indicates a role in cellular signaling or regulation processes (Saito2006The). The SAM domain's ability to bind RNA further implies that SAMD10 could play a part in the regulation of gene expression at the posttranscriptional level, affecting various cellular processes. The gene's location on the 20q13.33 chromosomal region and its association with gallbladder cancer cell lines highlight its potential significance in cancer biology, although its precise function in non-cancerous cells remains to be fully elucidated (Saito2006The).

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the SAMD10 gene is not fully understood, but it has been implicated in various conditions through alterations in its expression levels and potential mutations. In the context of cancer, SAMD10 was identified as an upregulated gene in nasopharyngeal cancer following radiotherapy, with a significant log2 fold change, suggesting a possible role in the cellular response to radiation (Nie2019Analysis). Additionally, SAMD10 is mentioned in gene networks related to ovarian cancer occurrence, although specific details about its clinical significance in this context are not provided (Li2023Transcriptomic).

In the realm of intellectual disability and related disorders, SAMD10 is listed among genes in genomic regions with copy number variations (CNVs) associated with intellectual disability, psychomotor retardation, and other phenotypic features. However, the specific impact of SAMD10 mutations or expression changes in these conditions remains unclear (Montagne2018CoDEseq).

Overall, while SAMD10 is associated with certain diseases and conditions, further research is needed to elucidate its precise role and clinical implications. Current studies highlight its potential involvement in cancer and neurological disorders, but detailed mechanisms and effects are yet to be fully characterized.
