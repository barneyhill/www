# SIVA1

## Overview
SIVA1 is a gene that encodes the SIVA1 apoptosis inducing factor, a protein involved in the regulation of apoptosis and other cellular processes. The SIVA1 protein is characterized by its distinct structural domains, including an N-terminal amphipathic helix, a B-box like PHD tripartite domain, and a zinc finger-like C-terminal domain, which facilitate its interactions with various proteins (Goulielmos2010The). Functionally, SIVA1 is implicated in the modulation of apoptosis, cell cycle control, and immune response regulation. It interacts with key proteins such as p53, FAIM-L, and XIAP, influencing pathways that govern cell death and survival (Du2009Suppression; Coccia2020SIVA1). SIVA1's role in ubiquitination and protein stability further underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Yin2018SIVA1). Clinically, alterations in SIVA1 expression and mutations have been linked to cancer progression, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (VermehrenSchmaedick2024Mutation).

## Structure
The SIVA1 protein, encoded by the SIVA1 gene, is characterized by several distinct structural domains that contribute to its function in apoptosis. It contains an N-terminal domain with an amphipathic helix, a putative B-box like PHD tripartite domain, and a zinc finger-like C-terminal domain. These domains are crucial for its interaction with other proteins, such as pyrin and GITR, and are involved in protein-protein interactions (Goulielmos2010The).

SIVA1 is also known to interact with the long isoform of the Fas apoptosis inhibitory molecule (FAIM-L) and the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), playing a role in regulating apoptosis and synaptic function. The interaction with FAIM-L and XIAP suggests that SIVA1 is involved in both apoptotic and non-apoptotic pathways in neurons (Coccia2020SIVA1).

The protein is predominantly cytosolic and is found in various regions of the brain, including the telencephalon and cerebellum, where it is primarily expressed in neurons (Coccia2020SIVA1). SIVA1 has been described to have E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, which may contribute to its role in protein ubiquitination and stability (Coccia2020SIVA1).

## Function
The SIVA1 gene encodes a protein that plays a multifaceted role in cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of apoptosis and cell cycle control. In healthy human cells, SIVA1 is involved in an auto-regulatory feedback loop with the tumor suppressor protein p53. It promotes the interaction between p53 and its E3 ligase Mdm2, enhancing Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of p53. This mechanism helps maintain low levels of p53 in unstressed cells, preventing unnecessary cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (Du2009Suppression; Mei2012Multifaceted).

SIVA1 also interacts with stathmin, a microtubule-destabilizing protein, to suppress epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor metastasis. By inhibiting stathmin's activity, SIVA1 stabilizes microtubules, thereby suppressing cell migration and EMT (Mei2012Multifaceted). Additionally, SIVA1 is involved in the regulation of IL-2 gene expression in T cells, acting as a negative regulator by inhibiting NF-kB activity, which is crucial for immune response modulation (Hench2011Regulation).

SIVA1 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it may participate in transcriptional regulation and protein degradation pathways, contributing to protein homeostasis and cellular stability (Yin2018SIVA1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SIVA1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. SIVA1 is involved in the regulation of apoptosis and tumor suppression, and its dysregulation can contribute to cancer progression. In breast cancer, low levels of SIVA1 are associated with increased tumor metastasis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Mei2012Multifaceted). The SIVA-D160N mutation, identified in breast cancer, acts as a dominant negative mutation, enhancing cell migration and invasion, which are key processes in metastasis (VermehrenSchmaedick2024Mutation). This mutation may disrupt protein stability or interactions, particularly affecting the Zing-finger domain, and is more common in metastatic cases (VermehrenSchmaedick2024Mutation).

SIVA1 also plays a role in modulating p53 activity, a crucial tumor suppressor. It interacts with p53 and Hdm2, enhancing p53 degradation and inhibiting its tumor-suppressive functions. Downregulation of SIVA1 leads to increased p53 levels and reduced tumor formation, indicating that SIVA1 acts as a potent inhibitor of p53 (Du2009Suppression). These interactions suggest that targeting SIVA1 could be a potential strategy for cancer therapy, as its inhibition could stimulate p53 activity to eradicate tumor cells expressing wild-type p53 (Du2009Suppression).

## Interactions
SIVA1, also known as SIVA1 apoptosis inducing factor, is involved in various protein interactions that influence apoptosis and other cellular processes. SIVA1 interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase Hdm2, forming a ternary complex that enhances the interaction between p53 and Hdm2. This interaction promotes p53 degradation through ubiquitination, facilitated by Hdm2 (Du2009Suppression). SIVA1 also interacts with the single-stranded DNA-binding protein 3 (SSBP3), promoting its ubiquitination and influencing the stability of LIM-HD transcriptional complexes (Yin2018SIVA1).

In the context of apoptosis, SIVA1 interacts with FAIM-L, a death receptor antagonist, and XIAP, an inhibitor of caspases. SIVA1 modulates the interaction between FAIM-L and XIAP, leading to increased XIAP ubiquitination and degradation, which is crucial for caspase activation (Coccia2020SIVA1). SIVA1 also binds to the HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein, competing with the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-X L for binding, which influences apoptosis modulation (Severino2007Human). These interactions highlight SIVA1's role in regulating apoptosis and protein stability through its involvement in ubiquitination pathways.
