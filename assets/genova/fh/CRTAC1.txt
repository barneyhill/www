# CRTAC1

## Overview
CRTAC1 is a gene that encodes the protein cartilage acidic protein 1, a glycosylated extracellular matrix (ECM) protein primarily expressed in human articular cartilage. This protein plays a crucial role in maintaining cartilage integrity and facilitating cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, which are essential for the biomechanical properties of cartilage, such as load absorption and joint movement (Steck2007Chondrocyte). CRTAC1 exists in two splice variants, CRTAC1-A and CRTAC1-B, with distinct tissue distributions and functions. The protein is characterized by a seven-bladed beta-propeller structure and contains an RGD integrin-binding motif, suggesting its involvement in cellular adhesion processes (Steck2007Chondrocyte; Anjos2016Cartilage). Beyond its structural role, CRTAC1 is implicated in various biological processes, including energy metabolism, wound healing, and modulation of the complement system, with potential implications in aging and pathological conditions such as cancer and pulmonary diseases (Jin2023CRTAC1; Letsiou2021Deciphering).

## Structure
The CRTAC1 protein, encoded by the CRTAC1 gene, is a glycosylated extracellular matrix molecule primarily found in human articular cartilage. It consists of 661 amino acids, including a 27 amino acid signal peptide at the N-terminus and an EGF-like calcium-binding motif near the C-terminus (Steck2007Chondrocyte). The protein features a seven-bladed beta-propeller structure, characterized by seven phenylalanyl-glycyl-glycylalanyl-prolyl (FG-GAP) repeats, which contribute to its beta-strand rich secondary structure (Anjos2016Cartilage). 

CRTAC1 exists in two splice variants, CRTAC1-A and CRTAC1-B. CRTAC1-A is prevalent in cartilage and lung, while CRTAC1-B is more prominent in the brain. The CRTAC1-A isoform includes five putative O-glycosylation motifs, with glycosylation confirmed at Thr626, contributing to its higher molecular weight of approximately 95 kDa compared to the predicted 68 kDa (Steck2007Chondrocyte). Both isoforms contain an RGD integrin-binding motif, suggesting roles in cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions (Steck2007Chondrocyte). The protein's structure is highly conserved across species, indicating its functional importance (Anjos2016Cartilage).

## Function
The CRTAC1 gene encodes a glycosylated extracellular matrix (ECM) protein known as cartilage acidic protein 1, which plays a significant role in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, as well as calcium-binding. This protein is primarily expressed in human articular cartilage and is involved in maintaining the structural integrity of cartilage, contributing to its biomechanical properties such as load absorption and joint movement (Steck2007Chondrocyte).

In human dermal fibroblasts, CRTAC1-A, a variant of the CRTAC1 protein, enhances ATP levels, mitochondrial activity, and energy metabolism, promoting cell proliferation and migration, which are crucial for wound healing (Letsiou2020Cartilage; Letsiou2021Deciphering). The protein influences the expression of genes involved in ECM organization, such as COL3A1, ASPN, and DCN, and affects pathways related to ECM degradation and collagen remodeling (Letsiou2021Deciphering).

CRTAC1 also plays a role in the regulation of the complement system, which is involved in tissue growth and regeneration, by upregulating genes like C1R, CFH, C1S, and CFB (Letsiou2021Deciphering). The protein's activities suggest potential anti-aging effects and involvement in pathological conditions related to angiogenesis (Letsiou2021Deciphering).

## Clinical Significance
The CRTAC1 gene has been identified as having significant clinical implications in various cancers, particularly lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In LUAD, CRTAC1 expression is significantly reduced in tumor tissues compared to normal lung tissues, and this downregulation is associated with advanced pathological stages and poorer prognosis. High CRTAC1 expression correlates with better outcomes and earlier cancer stages, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (Tan2024CRTAC1). 

In NSCLC, CRTAC1 enhances chemosensitivity to cisplatin, a common chemotherapy drug. High CRTAC1 expression is linked to better overall survival and increased sensitivity to cisplatin, while low expression predicts poor prognosis. CRTAC1 promotes cisplatin sensitivity by inhibiting Akt1 expression and enhancing calcium signaling, which leads to increased apoptosis in cancer cells (Jin2023CRTAC1). 

Beyond cancer, CRTAC1 expression is also associated with pulmonary conditions. Low levels of CRTAC1 are linked to decreased lung function and are observed in diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis and COVID-19, indicating its potential as a biomarker for lung health (Jin2023CRTAC1).

## Interactions
CRTAC1, or cartilage acidic protein 1, is involved in several interactions that influence cellular processes. It contains FG-GAP domains, which are known to bind calcium and are involved in cell-matrix interactions, similar to those found in integrins, which mediate cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix adhesion (Steck2007Chondrocyte). CRTAC1 also has an RGD motif, a tripeptide recognized by integrins, suggesting potential interactions with these proteins, although the specific function of this motif in CRTAC1 remains speculative (Steck2007Chondrocyte).

In the context of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), CRTAC1 enhances chemosensitivity to cisplatin by promoting the transcription of the STUB1 gene. This is achieved through the activation of the transcription factor NFATC1, which is facilitated by CRTAC1's role in increasing intracellular calcium levels via the RyR channel. This interaction leads to upregulated STUB1 expression and increased apoptosis in NSCLC cells treated with cisplatin (Jin2023CRTAC1). CRTAC1 also inhibits Akt phosphorylation by downregulating Akt1 expression, which is crucial for tumor cell survival, thereby promoting apoptosis and enhancing chemosensitivity (Jin2023CRTAC1). These interactions highlight CRTAC1's role in modulating key signaling pathways in cancer cells.
