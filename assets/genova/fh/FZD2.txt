# FZD2

## Overview
FZD2 is a gene that encodes the frizzled class receptor 2, a member of the frizzled family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This receptor is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure and a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) at the N-terminus, which is essential for binding Wnt proteins and initiating signaling pathways (Dijksterhuis2015Systematic; Nile2019Fatty). FZD2 plays a pivotal role in the Wnt signaling pathway, influencing cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration through both β-catenin-dependent and independent mechanisms (Dijksterhuis2014WNTFrizzled). It is involved in various physiological processes and has significant implications in pathological conditions, including cancer and skeletal dysplasia (Asano2017Clinical; Türkmen2017A). The receptor's ability to interact with multiple proteins and participate in complex signaling networks underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Structure
FZD2, a member of the frizzled family of G protein-coupled receptors, features a seven-transmembrane domain structure typical of GPCRs (Dijksterhuis2015Systematic). The protein includes a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) at the N-terminus, which is crucial for ligand binding, particularly with Wnt proteins. This domain is composed of approximately 120 amino acids and contains 10 conserved cysteine residues that form disulfide bonds, contributing to its compact globular structure with a hydrophobic groove (Nile2019Fatty). The CRD's structure is essential for recognizing the fatty acyl moiety of Wnt proteins, facilitating their interaction with FZD2 to initiate signaling (Nile2019Fatty).

The CRD of FZD2 can exist in multiple states, including monomers and dimers, with dimerization influenced by local concentrations and the presence of Wnt ligands. Fatty acids, particularly unsaturated ones, stabilize the dimeric conformation of FZD CRDs (Nile2019Fatty). The lipid-binding cavity of FZD2 exhibits plasticity, allowing flexibility in binding different fatty acids, with a C16 fatty acid following a linear trajectory along the hydrophobic cavity in the FZD2 CRD complex (Nile2019Fatty). These structural features are critical for the protein's function in the Wnt signaling pathway.

## Function
FZD2 (frizzled class receptor 2) is a receptor involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, which plays a crucial role in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. FZD2 is capable of triggering both β-catenin-dependent and β-catenin-independent signaling pathways, including the Ca2+ pathway. In particular, the interaction between FZD2 and WNT-5A has been shown to activate phosphodiesterase 6 (PDE6), leading to calcium mobilization in melanoma cell lines. This interaction highlights the specific binding of WNT-5A to FZD2 and the involvement of G proteins in this pathway (Dijksterhuis2014WNTFrizzled).

In lung epithelial cells, FZD2 is essential for mediating Wnt3a signaling, particularly when co-expressed with Ror2, a receptor-tyrosine kinase. This cooperation enhances the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, which is crucial for cellular responsiveness to Wnt ligands (Li2008Ror2). FZD2 is also expressed in human ovarian granulosa cells, where it is suggested to play a role in transmembrane signal transmission and cell differentiation during long-term in vitro culture (Kranc2018Genes).

FZD2 is primarily active at the cell membrane, where it interacts with Wnt ligands to initiate intracellular signaling cascades, influencing various developmental processes and maintaining tissue homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the FZD2 gene have significant clinical implications in various diseases, particularly cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), FZD2 is linked to the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process crucial for tumor invasion and metastasis. High FZD2 expression correlates with a mesenchymal phenotype and is an independent predictor of recurrence, associated with poorer recurrence-free survival in HCC patients (Asano2017Clinical). In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), FZD2 is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis. It promotes cell migration and invasion through the FZD2/STAT3 signaling pathway, contributing to cancer metastasis (Fu2020WNT2Mediated).

FZD2 is also implicated in endometrial cancer, where its overexpression enhances cell migration and EMT, promoting metastasis (Bian2016Promotion). In tongue squamous cell carcinoma, FZD2 overexpression is linked to decreased overall survival and increased tumorigenicity (Huang2019FZD2). Beyond cancer, a novel de novo mutation in FZD2 is associated with autosomal dominant omodysplasia, a skeletal dysplasia characterized by facial dysmorphism and short upper extremities, highlighting its role in skeletal development (Türkmen2017A). These findings underscore the potential of FZD2 as a therapeutic target in cancer and other conditions.

## Interactions
FZD2 interacts with various proteins within the Wnt signaling pathway, playing a crucial role in mediating signal transduction. It is known to interact with Wnt ligands, such as Wnt3a, to activate canonical Wnt signaling pathways. This interaction is facilitated by the cooperation of FZD2 with other proteins like Ror2, which enhances the Wnt3a-stimulated signaling response. The CRD domain of Ror2 is essential for this cooperative function, although the tyrosine kinase activity of Ror2 is not required (Li2008Ror2).

FZD2 also participates in the WNT2/STAT3 signaling axis, which is significant in the context of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). In this pathway, FZD2 is upregulated by WNT2, leading to increased phosphorylation of STAT3 and upregulation of mesenchymal markers such as TWIST1 and Slug. This interaction is crucial for the migration and invasion of ESCC cells, highlighting FZD2's role in cancer metastasis (Fu2020WNT2Mediated).

In addition, FZD2 is involved in forming complexes with other components of the Wnt pathway, such as Dishevelled proteins, which are critical for the regulation of gene expression and cellular responses to Wnt signals (Voloshanenko2017Mapping).
