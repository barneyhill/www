# OR8K3

## Overview
The OR8K3 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 8 subfamily K member 3, which is part of the olfactory receptor family. These receptors are a subset of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that play a crucial role in the detection of odorants, contributing to the sense of smell. The OR8K3 protein is involved in the transduction of olfactory signals through its interaction with odorant molecules, initiating a neuronal response that ultimately leads to the perception of smell. While primarily associated with olfactory function, variations in the OR8K3 gene have been studied in various clinical contexts, including endometrial cancer and genetic diversity within specific populations (John2018Assessment; Li2020Establishment).

## Clinical Significance
The OR8K3 gene has been implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly in relation to endometrial cancer (EC). Studies have shown that OR8K3 is downregulated in EC tissue samples compared to normal tissues. This downregulation is also observed in cases with lymph node metastasis, myometrial invasion, and recurrence, suggesting a potential role in cancer progression (Li2020Establishment). The expression of OR8K3 is positively associated with other genes such as GABRA2 and RIPPLY2, and there is an inverse correlation between the methylation and mRNA levels of these genes, indicating that methylation might influence their expression (Li2020Establishment). A risk score model based on the methylation signature of OR8K3 and other genes has been developed to stratify EC patients into high- and low-risk groups, showing significant differences in survival outcomes (Li2020Establishment).

In the context of genetic diversity, OR8K3 has been identified with homozygous loss-of-function variants in the Kuwaiti population, which overlap with similar findings in the Icelandic dataset. This suggests a potential impact on gene function, although specific clinical implications remain unclear (John2018Assessment). In hemophilia A patients, a missense mutation in OR8K3 (rs960193) has been associated with a potential protective effect against inhibitor development, though this finding is not statistically significant (Gorski2016Wholeexome).
