# CUL9

## Overview
CUL9 is a gene that encodes the protein cullin 9, a member of the cullin family of proteins, which are integral components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. As a non-canonical cullin, cullin 9 functions primarily as a scaffold protein within E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, facilitating the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins (Ortolano2021A). The protein is characterized by its large size and complex structure, forming a unique hexameric assembly with RBX1, a RING protein, which is essential for its E3 ligase activity (HornGhetko2024Noncanonical). Cullin 9 is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of genomic stability, apoptosis, and neuronal development, and it interacts with key proteins such as TP53, influencing their function and localization (Zheng2022High). The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to cancer progression, particularly in colorectal cancer, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Zhang2024Comprehensive; Zheng2022High).

## Structure
The CUL9 protein, also known as PARC or H7-AP1, is a large cullin and RBR protein that forms a unique 1.8-MDa hexameric triangular assembly with RBX1, a RING protein (HornGhetko2024Noncanonical). This complex is characterized by a triangular structure with 240 Å-long vertices and measures 255 Å across, featuring six inward-facing globular domains (HornGhetko2024Noncanonical). The CUL9 protein contains several domains, including the Ariadne domain, Rcat domain, CPH domain, ARM domains, DOC domain, and RBR element, each contributing to its function (HornGhetko2024Noncanonical).

The CUL9-RBX1 complex is distinct due to its self-mediating assembly, where both ends of each protomer connect to another, forming a boomerang shape. The bends in these boomerangs create the corners of the triangular hexamer (HornGhetko2024Noncanonical). The neddylation of CUL9, particularly at the K1881 site, is crucial for its activity, influencing the structural conformation and interactions with RBX1 (HornGhetko2024Noncanonical). The neddylated WHB domain of CUL9 is rotated and translated, promoting the active configuration of the E3 ligase (HornGhetko2024Noncanonical).

CUL9's structure integrates both neddylated CRL and RBR E3 functionalities within a single polypeptide, highlighting its unique combination of CRL E3 and ARIH-family RBR E3 properties (HornGhetko2024Noncanonical). The structural arrangement of CUL9's WHB domain and RBX1 RING is crucial for neddylation, with the ARIH-RBR element playing a protective role (HornGhetko2024Noncanonical).

## Function
CUL9, a non-canonical member of the Cullin RING ligases (CRLs), plays a significant role in protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. It functions as a scaffold protein in E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin to target proteins, marking them for degradation (Ortolano2021A). CUL9 is involved in maintaining genomic stability and regulating apoptosis, although it does not directly degrade cytochrome c in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) (Ortolano2021A).

In healthy human cells, CUL9 interacts with the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), particularly with the subunit APC7, suggesting a role in protein stability regulation. However, it does not appear to affect the abundance of APC/C subunits or alter cell cycle progression (Ortolano2021A). CUL9 is highly expressed in the brain, especially during neural induction, and its expression increases during cortical differentiation, indicating its involvement in neuronal development (Ortolano2021A).

CUL9 also plays a role in transcriptional regulation and cell cycle progression, as indicated by its interactions with proteins involved in these processes (Ortolano2021A). Its function and regulation are dynamic during cellular differentiation, with significant changes in proteins involved in lipid metabolism observed in CUL9 knockout cells (Ortolano2021A).

## Clinical Significance
CUL9 (cullin 9) has been implicated in various cancers, particularly colorectal cancer (CRC) and colon cancer, due to its role in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and interaction with the p53 protein. High expression of CUL9 is associated with poor prognosis in CRC, correlating with shorter overall survival and increased recurrence rates in patients with high-risk stage II and III colon cancer (Zhang2024Comprehensive; Zheng2022High). This suggests that CUL9 expression levels can serve as a prognostic biomarker and may help stratify patients for adjuvant chemotherapy, with those exhibiting high CUL9 expression potentially benefiting from full-dose chemotherapy regimens (Zheng2022High).

CUL9 mutations, such as rs2273709, are prevalent in colorectal liver metastases, indicating a role in cancer progression and metastasis (Zheng2022High). The gene's interaction with p53, where CUL9 overexpression leads to cytoplasmic sequestration of p53, may affect chemotherapy response and patient survival (Zheng2022High). Additionally, CUL9 is involved in inhibiting ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death, through its interaction with p53, which may contribute to its role in cancer pathogenesis (Yang2022Cullin-9/p53). These findings highlight CUL9's potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
CUL9, also known as cullin 9, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. CUL9 forms a complex with RBX1, creating a unique 1.8-MDa hexameric assembly that is essential for its E3 ligase activity. This complex is involved in the ubiquitylation of proteins such as TP53, a tumor suppressor, where it mediates multi-monoubiquitylation, suggesting a regulatory role rather than promoting degradation (HornGhetko2024Noncanonical).

CUL9 interacts with the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) subunits, particularly APC7, indicating a potential role in ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (Ortolano2021A). It also interacts with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, such as UBE2L3, which binds to the RING1 domain of neddylated CUL9, and UBE2F, which is involved in its neddylation process (HornGhetko2024Noncanonical).

CUL9's interaction with p53 is significant in cancer biology, where it acts as a cytoplasmic anchor for p53, influencing its localization and function in apoptosis and chemotherapy response (Zheng2022High). These interactions highlight CUL9's role in regulating cell cycle, apoptosis, and potentially neurodevelopmental processes.
