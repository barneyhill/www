# ACTR1B

## Overview
ACTR1B is a gene that encodes the actin-related protein 1B, a critical component of the dynactin complex, which is a multi-subunit protein complex involved in various cellular processes. The protein encoded by ACTR1B is categorized as part of the cytoskeletal proteins, specifically within the Arp1 rod of the dynactin complex, playing a significant role in intracellular transport, cell shape maintenance, and motility by facilitating the movement of vesicles and organelles along microtubules (Tey2016Mutation). Additionally, ACTR1B is implicated in activin signaling through the Smad2/3 pathway, part of the TGF-β superfamily, which regulates cellular activities such as proliferation, migration, and survival (Tamminen2015Overexpression). Despite its involvement in these critical cellular functions, mutations in ACTR1B have not been conclusively linked to hereditary peripheral neuropathies, although it remains a candidate for further genetic studies (Tey2016Mutation).

## Structure


## Function
ACTR1B (actin-related protein 1B) is a component of the dynactin complex, a multi-subunit protein complex essential for various cellular activities, including mitosis and retrograde axonal transport. The dynactin complex is crucial for intracellular transport, cell shape maintenance, and motility by facilitating the movement of vesicles and organelles along microtubules (Tey2016Mutation). ACTR1B is part of the Arp1 rod within the dynactin complex, which is involved in cytoskeleton organization and is active in the cytoplasm, particularly associated with microtubules (Tey2016Mutation).

In the context of signaling pathways, ACTR1B, also known as activin receptor type-1B, mediates activin signaling through the Smad2/3 pathway. This signaling is part of the TGF-β superfamily, which regulates various cellular activities such as proliferation, migration, and survival (Tamminen2015Overexpression). The role of ACTR1B in activin signaling highlights its importance in cellular communication and response to external stimuli, contributing to the regulation of cell growth and differentiation processes. These functions are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
The ACTR1B gene, which encodes actin-related protein 1 homolog B, has been investigated for its potential role in hereditary peripheral neuropathies, including Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), hereditary motor neuropathy (HMN), and hereditary sensory neuropathy (HSN). A study conducted by Tey et al. screened the ACTR1B gene among others in the dynactin complex for mutations that could be linked to these conditions. Two non-synonymous variants in ACTR1B were identified: p.Ala143Val and p.Met45Val. The p.Met45Val variant is a common polymorphism, while the p.Ala143Val variant was predicted to be harmful by computational tools such as SIFT and Polyphen-2. However, segregation analysis revealed that the p.Ala143Val variant was also present in unaffected family members, suggesting it is not likely to be involved in disease pathogenesis (Tey2016Mutation).

The study concluded that none of the identified variants in the dynactin complex genes, including ACTR1B, segregated with the disease phenotype, indicating they are unlikely to be disease-causing. Despite these findings, the genetic heterogeneity of hereditary peripheral neuropathies suggests that ACTR1B and other dynactin complex genes remain candidates for further investigation in unsolved cases (Tey2016Mutation).

## Interactions
ACTR1B, also known as actin-related protein 1B, is a component of the dynactin complex, which plays a crucial role in cellular processes such as mitosis and retrograde axonal transport. The dynactin complex is a multi-subunit protein complex that includes ACTR1B as part of its Arp1 rod structure, which consists of Arp1 filaments (ACTR1A/1B) and a heterotetrameric complex composed of p62 (DCTN4), p25 (DCTN5), p27 (DCTN6), and Arp11 (Tey2016Mutation). This complex is essential for dynein-mediated transport, facilitating the movement of various cellular components along microtubules.

In the context of hereditary peripheral neuropathies, ACTR1B was screened for mutations, and two non-synonymous variants were identified: p.Ala143Val and p.Met45Val. However, these variants did not segregate with the disease phenotype, suggesting they are not a common cause of these neuropathies (Tey2016Mutation). Despite the identification of these variants, specific physical interactions of ACTR1B with other proteins or nucleic acids were not detailed in the studies reviewed. The role of ACTR1B in the dynactin complex highlights its importance in intracellular transport and cytoskeletal organization, although further research is needed to elucidate its specific interaction partners.
