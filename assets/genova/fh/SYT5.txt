# SYT5

## Overview
The SYT5 gene encodes the protein synaptotagmin 5, which is a member of the synaptotagmin family of proteins known for their role in calcium-dependent exocytosis. Synaptotagmin 5 is characterized by its transmembrane domain and two C-terminal C2 domains, which are essential for its function as a calcium sensor in various cellular processes, including neurotransmitter release and endothelial cell function (Lenzi2019Synaptotagmin). The protein is involved in the regulation of exocytosis in both neuronal and endothelial cells, playing a critical role in synaptic vesicle recycling and the exocytosis of Weibel-Palade bodies, respectively (Lenzi2019Synaptotagmin; Kleine2020Interactions). Through its interactions with other proteins and its structural features, synaptotagmin 5 contributes to essential physiological processes such as synaptic transmission and hemostasis.

## Structure
Synaptotagmin 5 (SYT5) is a protein involved in calcium-dependent exocytosis, characterized by its structural domains and specific molecular features. The primary structure of SYT5 includes a short N-terminal region, a transmembrane domain, a linker region, and two C-terminal C2 domains, known as C2A and C2B, which are crucial for calcium-dependent binding to phospholipids (Lenzi2019Synaptotagmin). These C2 domains are responsible for modulating interactions with the phospholipid bilayer and effector proteins, facilitating vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane (Qiu2011Cloning).

The tertiary structure of SYT5 involves the folding of these domains, allowing it to function as a calcium sensor. The C2A domain, in particular, has been crystallized, revealing its structural conformation in the hexagonal space group P65 (Qiu2011Cloning). This structural arrangement is essential for its role in exocytosis processes, such as insulin release and phagosome maturation (Qiu2011Cloning).

Post-translational modifications, such as palmitoylation of cysteine residues within the linker region, may play a role in the trafficking of SYT5 to secretory granules (Lenzi2019Synaptotagmin). These structural features enable SYT5 to participate in various cellular processes, including neurotransmitter release and endothelial cell function.

## Function
Synaptotagmin 5 (SYT5) is a calcium-binding protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of exocytosis in various cell types, including endothelial and neuronal cells. In human endothelial cells, SYT5 acts as a calcium sensor that facilitates the exocytosis of Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs), which are specialized secretory granules storing von Willebrand factor and other mediators involved in blood clotting and inflammation. SYT5 is incorporated into WPBs during their formation and is essential for their calcium-driven exocytosis, particularly in response to elevated intracellular calcium levels (Lenzi2019Synaptotagmin).

In the nervous system, SYT5 is involved in synaptic vesicle recycling and neurotransmitter release. It functions as a synaptic calcium sensor, facilitating calcium-dependent vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane, which is critical for efficient synaptic transmission. SYT5 is expressed in synaptic terminals and is involved in maintaining normal synaptic function by regulating vesicle recycling and neurotransmitter release (Kleine2020Interactions). The protein's role in these processes highlights its importance in both vascular and neuronal functions, contributing to hemostasis and synaptic communication, respectively.

## Interactions
Synaptotagmin 5 (SYT5) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. In Arabidopsis, SYT5 interacts with SYT1 and CLB1 at endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane contact sites (EPCS), forming a complex that plays a role in root hair polarity maintenance. These interactions are supported by shared domain architectures, including a synaptotagmin-like mitochondrial lipid-binding protein (SMP) domain and phospholipid-binding C2 domains (Lee2020Rare).

In human endothelial cells, SYT5 regulates calcium-dependent exocytosis of Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs). It interacts with WPB SNAREs, although it binds poorly to SNAP23, indicating a complex network of calcium sensors coordinating WPB exocytosis (Lenzi2019Synaptotagmin).

In SiMa human neuroblastoma cells, SYT5 interacts with antibodies against Helicobacter pylori and Campylobacter jejuni, which can impair vesicle recycling and intracellular calcium transients. This interaction suggests a potential link between bacterial infections and neurological conditions, possibly through molecular mimicry (Kleine2020Interactions).

These interactions highlight SYT5's role in various cellular processes, including vesicle trafficking and exocytosis, across different biological systems.
