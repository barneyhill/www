# ANKS1B

## Overview
ANKS1B is a gene that encodes the ankyrin repeat and sterile alpha motif domain containing 1B protein, commonly referred to as AIDA-1. This protein is a complex scaffold protein predominantly expressed in the brain, where it plays a critical role in synaptic signaling and plasticity. AIDA-1 is characterized by its structural domains, including ankyrin repeats, sterile alpha motif (SAM) domains, and a phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain, which facilitate its interactions with various synaptic proteins. These interactions are essential for maintaining synaptic structure and function, particularly in the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses. AIDA-1 is involved in processes such as synaptic plasticity, neuronal development, and myelination, and its dysregulation is associated with several neuropsychiatric and cognitive disorders, including schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder (Carbonell2019Haploinsufficiency; Wang2024AIDA1ANKS1B; Younis2019The).

## Structure
The ANKS1B gene encodes the AIDA-1 protein, which is a complex scaffold protein predominantly expressed in the brain. AIDA-1 contains several distinct functional domains, including six N-terminal ankyrin repeats, two sterile alpha motif (SAM) domains, and a C-terminal phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain (Carbonell2019Haploinsufficiency; Younis2019The). The ankyrin repeats are involved in linking membrane proteins to the cytoskeleton, while the SAM domains include a nuclear import signal, and the PTB domain is crucial for tyrosine kinase signaling and binding to proteins like SynGAP (Wang2024AIDA1ANKS1B; Younis2019The).

The protein exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, including AIDA-1B, AIDA-1C, and AIDA-1D. These isoforms differ in their domain composition, with shorter isoforms lacking the ankyrin repeats (Carbonell2019Haploinsufficiency). The PTB domain of AIDA-1 binds with high affinity to the NPx[F/Y]-motif of SynGAP family proteins, a critical interaction for its role in synaptic functions (Wang2024AIDA1ANKS1B).

AIDA-1 is enriched in postsynaptic densities and is involved in synaptic plasticity, interacting with proteins such as PSD-95 and glutamate receptors (Younis2019The). The protein's structure and interactions suggest its significant role in neuronal activity and neurodevelopmental disorders. However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of ANKS1B are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The ANKS1B gene encodes the protein AIDA-1, which is highly expressed in the brain, particularly in neurons. AIDA-1 is a crucial component of the postsynaptic density (PSD) at excitatory synapses, where it interacts with N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and the synaptic scaffolding protein PSD95. This interaction is essential for synaptic plasticity, influencing processes such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), which are critical for learning and memory (Carbonell2019Haploinsufficiency; Cho2022ANKS1B).

AIDA-1 is involved in the regulation of synaptic NMDAR subunit composition, particularly the trafficking and localization of GluN2B subunits. It preferentially associates with GluN2B-containing NMDARs, stabilizing them at synaptic sites, which is vital for maintaining synaptic transmission and plasticity (Tindi2015ANKS1B).

In addition to its role in synaptic function, AIDA-1 is implicated in the regulation of neuronal development and function. It is involved in processes such as neuritogenesis and axon guidance signaling, which are essential for the development and maintenance of neuronal networks (Carbonell2019Haploinsufficiency). AIDA-1 also plays a role in the myelination of CNS axons, supporting oligodendrocyte function and contributing to normal neuronal communication (Cho2022ANKS1B).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ANKS1B gene are linked to several neuropsychiatric and cognitive disorders. In humans, genome-wide association studies have associated ANKS1B with schizophrenia (SCZ) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as well as general cognitive ability and educational attainment (Younis2019The). Rare variants in ANKS1B have been implicated in psychiatric disorders, with de novo variations found in discordant twins for SCZ and significant nonsynonymous variants identified in ASD (Younis2019The). The gene is also associated with mood disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder (Wang2024AIDA1ANKS1B).

ANKS1B's role in synaptic plasticity and its interactions with serotonin 2A receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases like ERBB4 suggest its involvement in antipsychotic drug response, particularly in SCZ (Younis2019The). The gene's expression is affected by replication stress, leading to chromosomal instability, which may contribute to various diseases (Kislova2023Replication). ANKS1B is also involved in cancer-related genomic instability, with focal rearrangements observed in multiple cancer cell lines (Kislova2023Replication). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ANKS1B in both psychiatric and other complex disorders.

## Interactions
ANKS1B, also known as AIDA-1, is a postsynaptic scaffold protein that plays a crucial role in synaptic signaling through its interactions with various proteins. AIDA-1 interacts with the SynGAP family of Ras-GTPase activating proteins (RasGAPs), including SynGAP, Dab2IP, and RASAL2, with high affinity and specificity. This interaction is mediated by the PTB domain of AIDA-1, which binds to an extended NPx[F/Y]-motif present in these proteins (Wang2024AIDA1ANKS1B). The interaction between AIDA-1 and SynGAP is particularly stable and is not influenced by posttranslational modifications, highlighting its significance in synaptic functions (Wang2024AIDA1ANKS1B).

AIDA-1 also binds to PSD-95, a key scaffolding protein in the postsynaptic density (PSD), through its C-terminal TTIF sequence. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the structural organization of the PSD (Dosemeci2016CaMKII‐mediated; Dosemeci2015AIDA1). Under excitatory conditions, AIDA-1 is displaced from the PSD core, a process mediated by CaMKII, which phosphorylates AIDA-1, leading to its redistribution within the PSD complex (Dosemeci2016CaMKII‐mediated; Dosemeci2015AIDA1). These interactions underscore the role of AIDA-1 in synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions.
