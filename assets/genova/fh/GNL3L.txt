# GNL3L

## Overview
GNL3L is a gene that encodes the G protein nucleolar 3-like protein, a member of the HSR1-MMR1 subfamily of GTPases. This protein is characterized by a unique circular permutation of its GTP-binding motifs and plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including ribosome biogenesis, cell cycle regulation, and nucleocytoplasmic transport. The GNL3L protein is primarily localized in the nucleolus, facilitated by its nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) and nuclear localization signal (NLS), and it interacts with several proteins to modulate cellular pathways. It is involved in the export of ribosomal subunits and influences cell cycle progression by regulating cyclins and E2F1 expression. Clinically, GNL3L is implicated in cancer, where its dysregulation is associated with poor prognosis and chemoresistance, particularly in acute myeloid leukemia and colorectal cancer, through pathways such as NF-κB and p53 (Li2024GNL3L; Thoompumkal2015GNL3L; Du2006The).

## Structure
The GNL3L protein is a 582 amino acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of approximately 63-65 kDa (Rao2006A; Thoompumkal2015GNL3L). It belongs to the HSR1-MMR1 subfamily of GTPases and features a unique circular permutation of its GTP-binding motifs, arranged in the order G5-G4-G1-G2-G3, differing from the typical G1-G2-G3-G4-G5 sequence found in other GTPases (Rao2006A; Thoompumkal2015GNL3L). The protein contains a G-domain and a C-terminal α-helical module, with the G-domain exhibiting the characteristic fold of P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolases (Rao2006A).

The N-terminal region of GNL3L includes a lysine-rich nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) necessary for its nucleolar targeting, and a nuclear localization signal (NLS) between amino acids 51-100 (Rao2006A; Thoompumkal2015GNL3L). The C-terminal domain is crucial for nuclear export, interacting with CRM1 for this process (Thoompumkal2015GNL3L). GNL3L's nucleolar localization is influenced by its interaction with importin-beta and importin-alpha, facilitated by its NoLS and NLS (Rao2006A; Thoompumkal2015GNL3L). The protein's structure and function are further modulated by its GTP-binding ability, with specific residues playing key roles in binding interactions (Rao2006A).

## Function
GNL3L is a nucleolar protein involved in several critical cellular processes, primarily ribosome biogenesis and cell cycle regulation. In healthy human cells, GNL3L plays a significant role in the processing and maturation of pre-rRNA, which is essential for the assembly of ribosomal subunits. It is involved in the export of the 60S ribosomal subunit from the nucleolus to the cytoplasm, a process crucial for protein synthesis and cell growth (Du2006The).

GNL3L functions as a nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling protein, interacting with the nuclear export receptor CRM1. This interaction is vital for its nuclear export, which is sensitive to Leptomycin B, indicating a regulatory mechanism for its localization and function (Thoompumkal2015GNL3L). The protein's C-terminal domain contains a nuclear export signal necessary for its interaction with CRM1, and mutations in this domain can affect its localization and function (Thoompumkal2015GNL3L).

GNL3L also influences cell cycle progression, particularly the 'S' phase, by modulating the expression of cyclins and E2F1, which are crucial for DNA synthesis and cell proliferation (Thoompumkal2015GNL3L). Its role in stabilizing TRF1, a telomere-associated protein, further underscores its importance in maintaining genomic stability during cell division (Tsai2009Nucleolar).

## Clinical Significance
The GNL3L gene is implicated in several cancers due to its role in cell proliferation and survival. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), GNL3L is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis. High expression of GNL3L correlates with worse overall survival in AML patients, as it activates the NF-κB pathway, promoting cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis and chemotherapy drugs like cytarabine (Li2024GNL3L).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), GNL3L is linked to chemoresistance. Its expression is upregulated in chemoresistant cells, contributing to cancer progression and metastasis through the NF-κB pathway. The downregulation of miR-4454, which targets GNL3L, is associated with increased GNL3L expression and chemoresistance. Overexpression of miR-4454 can reduce GNL3L levels, enhancing sensitivity to chemotherapy and promoting apoptosis (Kannathasan2020ChemoresistanceAssociated).

GNL3L also plays a role in stabilizing the MDM2 protein, which can suppress p53 activities, contributing to tumorigenesis in colorectal and gastric cancers. Its depletion leads to G2/M cell cycle arrest and upregulation of p53 targets, indicating its involvement in cancer development through p53 pathway modulation (Meng2010GNL3L).

## Interactions
GNL3L interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It binds to importin-beta via a novel lysine-rich nucleolar localization signal (NoLS), facilitating its transport into the nucleolus. This interaction is independent of importin-alpha, which is atypical for lysine-rich signals (Rao2006A). GNL3L also interacts with the estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERRγ) through its intermediate domain, inhibiting ERRγ's transcriptional activity by competing with coactivators such as SRC1 and SRC2 for binding to the AF2 domain of ERRγ (Yasumoto2007GNL3L).

GNL3L forms complexes with MDM2, stabilizing it by reducing its ubiquitylation, which affects the cell cycle and p53 activity (Meng2010GNL3L). It also interacts with LDOC1, modulating NF-κB signaling and affecting cell proliferation and apoptosis (Thoompumkal2016Leucine). These interactions highlight GNL3L's role in regulating various cellular pathways and maintaining genomic stability.
