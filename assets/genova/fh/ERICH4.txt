# ERICH4

## Overview
ERICH4 is a gene that encodes the protein glutamate rich 4, which is characterized by its high glutamate content. This protein is not currently categorized into a specific class such as kinases or receptors, but it has been implicated in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of cancer biology. Alterations in the expression and methylation patterns of ERICH4 have been associated with different types of cancer, including renal cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma. The gene's expression is influenced by nutritional interventions, such as those involving sulforaphane-containing broccoli sprouts, which have been shown to induce hypomethylation and overexpression of ERICH4, potentially contributing to anticancer effects (Brane2023Peripubertal). Additionally, ERICH4 interacts with other genes involved in cell growth regulation, suggesting a role in modulating cancer cell proliferation (Brane2023Peripubertal). Further research is needed to elucidate the precise functions and clinical significance of the glutamate rich 4 protein in cancer and other biological processes.

## Clinical Significance
ERICH4, also known as glutamate rich 4, has been implicated in various cancer-related processes due to alterations in its expression and methylation patterns. In a study focusing on peripubertal nutritional interventions, ERICH4 was identified as differentially methylated and expressed following treatment with sulforaphane-containing broccoli sprouts (BSp). This treatment led to hypomethylation and overexpression of ERICH4, which may contribute to anticancer effects observed in vivo (Brane2023Peripubertal). The gene's interaction with PPP2R5A, a gene involved in the negative control of cell growth, suggests a potential role in reducing cancer cell proliferation (Brane2023Peripubertal).

ERICH4's low expression has been associated with renal cell carcinoma, and its mutational loss has been recorded in basal cell carcinoma, indicating its potential involvement in these cancers (Brane2023Peripubertal). In colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), ERICH4 is significantly up-regulated in association with the FDX1 gene, although the specific clinical significance of ERICH4 in COAD remains unclear (Wang2022High). These findings highlight the need for further research to fully understand the clinical implications of ERICH4 expression and its interactions in cancer biology.
