# DDX19A

## Overview
DDX19A is a gene that encodes the DEAD-box helicase 19A, a member of the DEAD-box protein family characterized by the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD). This protein functions as an RNA helicase, playing a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including mRNA export, ribosomal biogenesis, and the DNA damage response. DEAD-box helicase 19A is primarily localized at the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear pore complex, where it facilitates the export of mRNA by interacting with nucleoporins and other proteins involved in mRNA processing (Okamura2018Depletion; Schmitt1999Dbp5). The protein's helicase activity is crucial for the remodeling of messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes, which is essential for their proper function and transport (Okamura2018Depletion). Additionally, DEAD-box helicase 19A is implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular physiology and disease states (MartínezBallesteros2017Machine; Cheng2024DDX19A).

## Function
DDX19A, also known as DEAD-box helicase 19A, is a crucial RNA helicase involved in several cellular processes. It plays a significant role in mRNA export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, a process essential for proper gene expression and cellular function. DDX19A is localized at the cytoplasmic surface of the nuclear pore complex, where it interacts with components such as Nup214 in humans, facilitating the export of poly(A)+ RNA (Okamura2018Depletion; Schmitt1999Dbp5). The helicase activity of DDX19A is stimulated by interactions with GLE1 and inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6), which are involved in the remodeling of messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes, necessary for their dissociation into the cytoplasm (Okamura2018Depletion).

Beyond mRNA export, DDX19A is involved in ribosomal elongation and termination, DNA damage response, and the import of the SRF coactivator MKL1 (Okamura2018Depletion; Rajakylä2015RNA). It also plays a role in the nuclear import of MKL1 by regulating its conformation, which is crucial for its interaction with the nuclear import machinery (Rajakylä2015RNA). These functions highlight DDX19A's importance in maintaining normal cellular functions, including mRNA export, translation regulation, and cell cycle progression (Okamura2018Depletion).

## Clinical Significance
DDX19A, a DEAD-box helicase, has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in RNA processing and transport. Alterations in DDX19A expression or function have been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). In AD, DDX19A is one of the genes with significant expression differences between healthy and affected individuals, suggesting its involvement in the disease's multifactorial nature, particularly in neuronal functions such as gene transcription and protein synthesis (MartínezBallesteros2017Machine).

In cancer, DDX19A is part of a gene signature associated with breast cancer, where it is involved in mRNA export and microRNA processing, potentially influencing cancer progression through post-transcriptional control mechanisms (Cava2014Integration). Additionally, DDX19A has been identified as a sensitizer to XPO1 inhibition in leukemia, where its loss enhances sensitivity to the drug eltanexor, especially in cells with SF3B1 mutations. This suggests a role in nucleocytoplasmic transport and potential therapeutic implications in cancer treatment (Chaudhry2024Altered).

DDX19A is also involved in immune responses, acting as an RNA sensor that promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation in response to viral infections, indicating its role in inflammation and immune regulation (Samir2022DEAD/H-Box).

## Interactions
DDX19A, a member of the DEAD-box helicase family, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It plays a significant role in the nuclear export of mRNAs by interacting with nucleoporins such as Nup214 and forming complexes with proteins like Gle1. These interactions facilitate the remodeling and export of mRNA-protein complexes (mRNPs) from the nucleus (Diot2016Influenza).

In the context of viral infections, DDX19A interacts with the influenza A virus polymerase in an RNA-independent manner. This interaction is crucial for the nuclear export of viral mRNAs, which is essential for efficient viral replication. The ATPase activity of DDX19A modulates its association with the viral polymerase, influencing the dynamics of this interaction (Diot2016Influenza).

In cancer, DDX19A has been shown to interact with PIK3CA mRNA in gastric cancer cells, stabilizing it and facilitating its export from the nucleus. This interaction is critical for activating the PI3K/AKT pathway, promoting cancer cell proliferation and migration (Cheng2024DDX19A). DDX19A also regulates NOX1 expression in cervical squamous cell carcinoma, enhancing reactive oxygen species production and contributing to cancer metastasis (Jiang2021DDX19A).
