# ARL13B

## Overview
ARL13B is a gene that encodes the protein ADP ribosylation factor like GTPase 13B, which is a member of the ARF family of small GTPases. This protein plays a critical role in ciliary function and maintenance, acting as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the small G-protein Arl3. It is primarily localized to the ciliary membrane, where it is involved in the regulation of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathways and the trafficking of key signaling components within cilia. The protein's structure includes a GTP-binding domain, an N-terminal amphipathic helix, and a coiled-coil domain, which are essential for its function in ciliary signaling and transport processes. Mutations in the ARL13B gene are linked to Joubert syndrome, a ciliopathy characterized by neuroanatomical abnormalities, underscoring its importance in maintaining proper ciliary function and structure (Cantagrel2008Mutations; Gotthardt2015A; Mariani2016Arl13b).

## Structure
ARL13B is a protein associated with ciliary function and is a member of the ARF family of GTPases. Its primary structure includes a GTP-binding domain, which is crucial for its interaction with other proteins and its role in ciliary processes (Revenkova2018The). The secondary structure of ARL13B features alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stability and function (Han2019TULP3). The tertiary structure involves a GTPase fold, which is typical for proteins in this family and is essential for its GTPase activity (Gotthardt2015A).

ARL13B contains several distinct domains, including an N-terminal amphipathic helix necessary for membrane insertion, a G domain, and an atypically elongated C-terminus that includes a coiled-coil domain and a proline-rich domain (PRD) (Revenkova2018The). The G domain is particularly important as it interacts with tubulin, a key component of the cytoskeleton, and is involved in maintaining protein distribution along the ciliary membrane (Revenkova2018The). ARL13B undergoes palmitoylation, a post-translational modification that aids in its association with the ciliary membrane (Han2019TULP3). The protein's structure and modifications are critical for its function in ciliary signaling and transport processes.

## Function
The ARL13B gene encodes a protein that is a member of the ARF family of GTPases, playing a crucial role in ciliary function and maintenance. In healthy human cells, ARL13B is primarily localized to the ciliary membrane, where it is involved in several key molecular processes. It functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the small G-protein Arl3, facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP on Arl3, which is essential for the targeting and release of lipidated cargo proteins to the cilium (Gotthardt2015A). 

ARL13B is also involved in the regulation of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathways. It regulates the trafficking of key Shh pathway components such as Patched1 (Ptch1), Smoothened (Smo), and Gli transcription factors within cilia, influencing both transcriptional and non-transcriptional Shh signaling pathways (Mariani2016Arl13b). The protein's GTPase activity is crucial for promoting the elongation of the ciliary membrane, although it is not necessary for its localization to the cilia (Lu2015A). 

Mutations in ARL13B can lead to Joubert syndrome, a ciliopathy characterized by neuroanatomical abnormalities, highlighting its importance in maintaining proper ciliary function and structure (Mariani2016Arl13b; Rafiullah2017A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ARL13B gene are associated with Joubert syndrome (JS), a rare autosomal recessive ciliopathy. This condition is characterized by developmental delays, neurological abnormalities, and a distinctive brain malformation known as the "molar tooth sign" on MRI. Patients with ARL13B mutations often exhibit symptoms such as congenital cerebellar ataxia, hypotonia, oculomotor apraxia, and intellectual disability (Cantagrel2008Mutations; Zhu2020The). 

ARL13B mutations can lead to defective cilia function, which is a hallmark of Joubert syndrome and related disorders. These mutations disrupt the normal ciliary signaling pathways, particularly affecting the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway, which is crucial for neural development and patterning (Hor2019Small; Cevik2010Joubert). In addition to neurological symptoms, ARL13B mutations can cause retinal dystrophy and other organ involvement, such as kidney and liver abnormalities, although the extent of these manifestations can vary among patients (Cantagrel2008Mutations; Dilan2018ARL13B).

Research using model organisms like zebrafish and mice has demonstrated that ARL13B is essential for proper ciliary function and development, and its absence can lead to severe developmental defects and early embryonic lethality (Cantagrel2008Mutations; Zhu2020The).

## Interactions
ARL13B, a small GTPase, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It directly interacts with the Smoothened (Smo) protein, a key component of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. This interaction is mediated by the GTP-binding domain of ARL13B and the C-tail of Smo, and is essential for the regulation of Smo trafficking and activation of the Hh signaling pathway, which is implicated in gastric tumorigenesis (Shao2017Arl13b).

ARL13B also interacts with β3-integrin, influencing its cell surface levels and playing a role in integrin-mediated signaling, which is important for cell migration and invasion in breast cancer. This interaction affects focal adhesion dynamics and is involved in actin cytoskeleton remodeling (Casalou2019Arl13b).

In the context of ciliogenesis, ARL13B regulates the localization of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling proteins within cilia, including the proper localization of Smo. It may interact with importin-β for ciliary entry, suggesting a role in protein trafficking to and within the cilium (Larkins2011Arl13b).
