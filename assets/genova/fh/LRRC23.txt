# LRRC23

## Overview
The LRRC23 gene encodes the leucine-rich repeat containing 23 protein, which is a critical component of the radial spoke 3 (RS3) head in the axonemal structure of mammalian spermatozoa. This protein is characterized by leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains that facilitate protein-protein interactions, playing a pivotal role in the assembly and function of radial spoke structures essential for sperm motility (Hwang2023LRRC23; Hwang2023LRRC23a). The LRRC23 protein interacts with other radial spoke head proteins, such as RSPH9, to maintain the structural integrity of the RS3 head, which is crucial for normal flagellar function (Hwang2023LRRC23). Mutations in the LRRC23 gene, particularly those leading to protein truncation, have been associated with male infertility due to impaired sperm motility, underscoring its significance in reproductive health (Hwang2023LRRC23; Zhang2021LRRC23).

## Structure
The LRRC23 protein is characterized by leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions. These domains typically form a horseshoe-shaped structure, contributing to the protein's secondary and tertiary structures (Hwang2023LRRC23a). The molecular structure of LRRC23 has been analyzed using various techniques, including cryo-electron tomography and AlphaFold2 predictions. The AlphaFold2 model of LRRC23 reveals a characteristic curved feature that fits well into a bent density underneath the radial spoke 3 (RS3) head, suggesting its role as a structural component of RS3 (Meng2023Highresolution; Meng2024Multiscale).

LRRC23 is essential for the assembly of the RS3 head in sperm flagella, a structure crucial for sperm motility. The protein interacts with RSPH9, another component of the RS head, although its localization is not affected in LRRC23 mutants (Hwang2023LRRC23). A splice site variant of LRRC23, leading to a truncated protein, has been identified in cases of male infertility, highlighting the importance of the C-terminal region for its function and localization in sperm flagella (Hwang2023LRRC23). The absence of the RS3 head due to LRRC23 truncation results in impaired sperm motility, underlying male infertility (Hwang2023LRRC23).

## Function
The LRRC23 gene encodes a protein that is a component of the radial spoke 3 (RS3) head in the axonemal structure of mammalian spermatozoa. This protein is crucial for the proper assembly and function of radial spoke structures, which are essential for the motility of sperm and other ciliated cells. In healthy cells, LRRC23 interacts with the radial spoke head protein RSPH9, and this interaction is vital for maintaining the structural integrity of the RS3 head, which is necessary for normal flagellar motility (Hwang2023LRRC23; Hwang2023LRRC23a).

LRRC23 is specifically involved in the assembly of the RS3 head and the RS2-RS3 bridge structure in mammalian sperm flagella, which are important for sperm motility and male fertility. The absence or truncation of LRRC23 leads to impaired assembly of these structures, resulting in defects in sperm motility (Hwang2023LRRC23a). The protein is expressed in tissues associated with ciliary and flagellar functions, such as the retina, testis, and fallopian tube, indicating its role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of cilia and flagella in healthy cells (Hwang2023LRRC23a).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LRRC23 gene have been linked to male infertility, particularly due to impaired sperm motility, a condition known as asthenozoospermia (ASZ). A specific splice site variant in LRRC23 leads to a truncated protein that fails to localize to the sperm tail, resulting in defective sperm motility and infertility in males (Hwang2023LRRC23). This mutation disrupts the assembly of the radial spoke 3 (RS3) head in sperm flagella, which is crucial for proper motility (Hwang2023LRRC23).

In mouse models, the absence of LRRC23 results in severe sperm motility defects and infertility, confirming its critical role in male reproductive health (Zhang2021LRRC23). The infertility phenotype in these models can be rescued by transgenic expression of LRRC23, further underscoring its importance (Zhang2021LRRC23).

While LRRC23 mutations have not been directly linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) or multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagella (MMAF), the gene's role in sperm-specific structures highlights its distinct physiological function in sperm motility rather than general ciliary movement (Hwang2023LRRC23).

## Interactions
The LRRC23 protein is involved in several key interactions that are crucial for its function in sperm motility. It is a component of the radial spoke 3 (RS3) head in sperm flagella and interacts with the radial spoke head protein RSPH9. This interaction is essential for the proper assembly and function of the RS3 head, which is critical for sperm motility (Hwang2023LRRC23a). The interaction between LRRC23 and RSPH9 is disrupted by C-terminal truncations of LRRC23, leading to impaired sperm motility and male infertility (Hwang2023LRRC23a).

LRRC23 also interacts with other proteins such as SDF4, SSSCA1, PASK, and TDRD1, as identified through immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) analysis. The potential interaction with PASK, a kinase, suggests that LRRC23 may be a substrate for phosphorylation, although no evidence was found for a cAMP-dependent protein kinase pathway involving LRRC23 (Zhang2021LRRC23). These interactions highlight the role of LRRC23 in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the radial spoke complex, which is essential for sperm motility and male fertility.
