# LHB

## Overview
The LHB gene encodes the luteinizing hormone beta subunit, a crucial component of the glycoprotein hormone luteinizing hormone (LH), which plays a significant role in human reproductive physiology. The LHB protein, characterized by its glycoprotein nature, forms a heterodimer with a common alpha subunit to create the active LH hormone. This hormone is essential for the activation of the luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin receptor (LHCGR), which regulates key reproductive processes such as testosterone production, spermatogenesis, ovulation, and progesterone synthesis (Nagirnaja2010Genomics; Potorac2016A). The LHB gene is located on chromosome 19q13.3, and its expression is primarily in the anterior pituitary gland. Mutations in the LHB gene can lead to various reproductive disorders, including hypogonadism and infertility, underscoring its importance in maintaining reproductive health (Althumairy2020Glycoprotein; Potorac2016A).

## Structure
The luteinizing hormone beta subunit (LHB) is a critical component of the luteinizing hormone, which plays a vital role in reproductive function. The primary structure of the LHB protein consists of 121 amino acids, featuring six disulfide bridges that contribute to its stability and function (Althumairy2020Glycoprotein). The LHB protein also contains two N-linked carbohydrate sites, which are essential for its glycosylation, a common post-translational modification that enhances the protein's stability and activity (Althumairy2020Glycoprotein).

In terms of quaternary structure, the LHB protein associates with a common alpha subunit to form the active luteinizing hormone. This heterodimeric structure is necessary for the full biological function of the hormone (Althumairy2020Glycoprotein). The LHB gene is located on chromosome 19q13.3, and rare mutations in this gene can impact hormone secretion, leading to conditions such as delayed puberty and hypogonadism in males (Althumairy2020Glycoprotein). The LHB protein's structure and its interaction with the alpha subunit are crucial for its role in reproductive signaling pathways.

## Function
The LHB gene encodes the beta subunit of luteinizing hormone (LH), a glycoprotein hormone essential for reproductive function. In healthy human cells, the LHB gene product combines with a common alpha subunit to form a heterodimer, which is crucial for the activation of the luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin receptor (LHCGR) (Potorac2016A). This activation is a key component of the signal transduction pathway that regulates endocrine functions, including testosterone production in Leydig cells and spermatogenesis in males, as well as ovulation and progesterone synthesis in females (Nagirnaja2010Genomics; Potorac2016A).

The proper function of the LHB gene ensures the correct synthesis, heterodimerization, and secretion of LH, which is vital for normal reproductive development and function (Potorac2016A). The transcriptional activity of the LHB gene is tightly regulated to maintain optimal hormone levels, as fluctuations can lead to reproductive issues such as hypogonadism and infertility (Nagirnaja2010Genomics). The LHB gene is expressed in the anterior pituitary gland, where it plays a critical role in the production of LH, influencing steroidogenesis and gametogenesis (Nagirnaja2010Genomics).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the LHB gene can lead to various reproductive disorders. Variations in the LHB gene are associated with conditions such as hypogonadism, infertility, and delayed puberty. For instance, a homozygous c.118_120del (p.Lys40del) mutation in the LHB gene results in severe hypogonadism in males, characterized by pubertal delay and undetectable LH levels. This mutation causes intracellular retention of the hormone, preventing its normal secretion (Potorac2016A). 

Inactivating mutations in the LHB gene can also lead to oligo-amenorrhea and infertility in women. These mutations disrupt mRNA splicing, resulting in aberrant transcripts that impair ovulation and corpus luteum formation (Arnhold2009Inactivating). 

The V-LH beta variant, involving Trp8Arg and Ile15Thr changes, is linked to altered immunoreactivity and increased in vitro biopotency, affecting gonadal function and potentially leading to subfertility (Nagirnaja2010Genomics). 

Additionally, certain point mutations in the LHB gene can result in immunologically anomalous LH variants, which may contribute to ovarian dysfunction and infertility (Furui1994Identification). These genetic alterations highlight the critical role of LHB in maintaining reproductive health.

## Interactions
The LHB gene encodes the beta subunit of luteinizing hormone, which interacts with the common glycoprotein alpha subunit (CGA) to form a functional hormone that activates the luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin receptor (LHCGR). This interaction is crucial for the hormone's biological activity, as demonstrated by studies showing that mutations in LHB, such as the deletion of lysine at position 40 (p.Lys40del), result in reduced receptor activation due to improper trafficking and intracellular retention of the hormone (Potorac2016A).

The LHB gene also contains an estrogen-responsive element (ERE) that interacts with the estrogen receptor (ER) complex. This interaction is essential for the transcriptional regulation of the LHB gene, as the binding of ER to the ERE stimulates transcription in response to 17-beta estradiol (E2). Mutations in the ERE sequence can abolish ER binding and the subsequent estrogen response, highlighting the importance of this interaction in gene regulation (Shupnik1991Identification).

Additionally, the LHB gene is subject to regulation by various transcription factors and chromatin structures, which influence its expression through complex interactions with nucleic acids and proteins (Shi2019Nr5a1b; Refael2024An).
