# KIF2A

## Overview
KIF2A is a gene that encodes the protein kinesin family member 2A, which is part of the kinesin-13 family. This protein is primarily involved in microtubule depolymerization, a critical process for cellular functions such as mitotic spindle assembly and chromosome segregation during cell division. Unlike other kinesins that transport cargo along microtubules, KIF2A functions by disassembling microtubules at their minus ends, thereby contributing to the dynamic instability necessary for proper cell cycle progression and neuronal development (Zhu2005Functional; Manning2007The). KIF2A is particularly important in neuronal cells, where it regulates axonal branching and is involved in maintaining genomic stability and normal cell proliferation (Homma2003Kinesin; Hirokawa2008Intracellular). Mutations in the KIF2A gene have been linked to various neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its significance in brain development and function (Partoens2021Modeling).

## Structure
KIF2A is a kinesin-13 family protein involved in microtubule depolymerization. The primary structure of KIF2A consists of 706 amino acids, with a motor domain located between residues 223 and 553 (Trofimova2018Ternary). The secondary structure includes a well-defined helix (α0a) in the neck region, which runs antiparallel to helix H12 of β1-tubulin, and a second helix (α0b) that contributes to the protein's function by interacting with tubulin dimers (Trofimova2018Ternary).

The tertiary structure of KIF2A features a motor domain that undergoes conformational changes upon binding to tubulin, particularly when complexed with a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog, AMPPNP. These changes involve reconfigurations of Switch 1 and 2, and the rotation of α4 and α5 helices, which facilitate interaction with tubulin (Trofimova2018Ternary). The neck region plays a critical role in forming a complex with tubulin, inducing significant bending necessary for microtubule depolymerization (Trofimova2018Ternary).

In terms of quaternary structure, KIF2A functions as a homodimer in vivo, although the study of its monomeric motor domain construct, Kif2A-NM, has provided insights into its interaction with tubulin (Trofimova2018Ternary). The protein's activity is regulated by ATP binding, which induces tubulin bending and destabilization of microtubule protofilaments (Trofimova2018Ternary).

## Function
KIF2A is a member of the kinesin-13 family, which functions primarily as a microtubule depolymerizer rather than a transporter of cargo along microtubules. It plays a critical role in mitotic spindle assembly and chromosome segregation during cell division by disassembling microtubules at their minus ends, contributing to poleward microtubule flux and maintaining spindle bipolarity (Zhu2005Functional; Manning2007The). KIF2A is essential for the proper formation of bipolar spindles, and its absence can lead to monopolar spindle formation, which disrupts normal cell cycle progression (Zhu2005Functional; Ganem2004The).

In neuronal cells, KIF2A is involved in regulating axonal branching by suppressing excessive elongation of axonal collateral branches, which is crucial for proper neuronal connectivity and function (Homma2003Kinesin; Hirokawa2008Intracellular). It is predominantly expressed in the juvenile brain, particularly in neuronal growth cones, where it interacts with phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase β (PIP5Kβ) to enhance its microtubule depolymerizing activity (Hirokawa2008Intracellular). KIF2A's role in microtubule dynamics is vital for maintaining genomic stability and normal cell proliferation, influencing both neuronal migration and cell cycle dynamics (Broix2017Ciliogenesis).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KIF2A gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders and malformations of cortical development (MCDs). These include conditions such as lissencephaly, microcephaly, and drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) (Partoens2021Modeling). KIF2A mutations, particularly missense variants like p.His321Asp, have been linked to cortical gyration abnormalities, intellectual disability, and pharmaco-resistant epilepsy (Gilet2020Conditional). The p.His321Asp mutation disrupts microtubule dynamics, leading to increased microtubule stability and impaired neuronal migration, which contributes to cortical layer disorganization and microcephaly (Gilet2020Conditional).

KIF2A is also crucial for the development and function of inhibitory synapses in the brain. Deletion of KIF2A in cortical interneurons results in disrupted migration, reduced inhibitory synapses, and an imbalance between excitation and inhibition, which can lead to epilepsy (RuizReig2023Inhibitory). This imbalance is associated with reduced levels of GABA A receptor subunits and impaired GABA production and transport, increasing epileptic susceptibility (RuizReig2023Inhibitory).

In zebrafish models, loss of KIF2A function results in microcephaly, increased seizure susceptibility, and neuronal proliferation defects, mirroring human phenotypes associated with KIF2A mutations (Partoens2021Modeling). These findings underscore the gene's role in maintaining proper neuronal positioning and brain development.

## Interactions
KIF2A, a member of the kinesin family, is involved in various protein interactions that regulate its function in microtubule dynamics. KIF2A interacts with AGAP1, a protein with GTP-binding, ankyrin repeats, and PH domains. This interaction enhances AGAP1's GAP activity and increases KIF2A's ATPase activity, suggesting a role in cytoskeleton remodeling crucial for cell movement (Luo2016Direct).

KIF2A also forms a complex with Plk1 during mitosis, where Plk1 phosphorylates KIF2A, enhancing its microtubule depolymerase activity and promoting its recruitment to spindle microtubules and poles (Jang2009Plk1). The MLL/WDR5 complex regulates KIF2A's localization to spindle microtubules, with the Win motif in KIF2A being crucial for its interaction with WDR5 and proper spindle assembly (Ali2017MLLWDR5).

In neuronal cells, KIF2A interacts with TRAX, a protein involved in neuritogenesis. This interaction is essential for the rescue of neurite outgrowth impaired by p53 blockage, highlighting KIF2A's role in neuronal development (Sun2010The). KIF2A also interacts with DDA3, which recruits it to spindle poles, influencing spindle dynamics and mitotic chromosome movement (Jang2008DDA3).
