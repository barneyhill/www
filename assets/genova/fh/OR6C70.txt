# OR6C70

## Overview
The OR6C70 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 6 subfamily C member 70, which is part of the olfactory receptor family. This family of proteins is primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules and is a subset of the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are characterized by their seven transmembrane domain structure. Olfactory receptors, including the protein encoded by OR6C70, play a crucial role in the olfactory system by binding specific odorants and initiating a neuronal response that leads to the perception of smell. The OR6C70 gene is one of many olfactory receptor genes that contribute to the diversity and specificity of olfactory perception in humans.
