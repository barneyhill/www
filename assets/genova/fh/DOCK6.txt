# DOCK6

## Overview
DOCK6 is a gene that encodes the protein dedicator of cytokinesis 6, which is a member of the DOCK family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of small Rho GTPases, particularly Rac1 and Cdc42, which are essential for actin cytoskeleton reorganization and various cellular processes such as cell migration, division, and axonal extension. DOCK6 is characterized by its two key domains, the Dock homology region-1 (DHR-1) and Dock homology region-2 (DHR-2), which facilitate its interaction with phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate and small Rho GTPases, respectively (Benson2021The). The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which influences its role in cellular signaling pathways (Laurin2014Insights). Mutations in the DOCK6 gene have been linked to Adams-Oliver syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in developmental disorders (Shaheen2011Recessive). Additionally, aberrant expression of DOCK6 has been implicated in cancer progression, further underscoring its importance in human health and disease (Li2018miR148b3p).

## Structure
DOCK6 is a member of the DOCK family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. The protein contains two key domains: the Dock homology region-1 (DHR-1) and the Dock homology region-2 (DHR-2). The DHR-1 domain, located between amino acids 544-723, is involved in membrane localization through interactions with phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3), a lipid product of PI3K activation (Benson2021The). The DHR-2 domain, spanning amino acids 1490-2016, is responsible for binding and activating small Rho GTPases, such as CDC42 and RAC1, which are crucial for actin polymerization and cytoskeletal reorganization (Benson2021The).

The N-terminal region of DOCK6, encompassing amino acids 1-157, shows structural similarity to the guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(T) subunit gamma-T1, suggesting a potential role in G protein signaling (Dessay2022Attenuated). Another region, between amino acids 158-543, resembles the C2A domain of human Dysferlin, which is involved in targeting proteins to cell membranes (Dessay2022Attenuated).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, regulate DOCK6 activity. For instance, phosphorylation of DOCK6 by Akt1 on Ser1194 inhibits its GEF activity, affecting axon growth during development (Laurin2014Insights). The protein's structure and function are further influenced by splice variants, although specific isoforms are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
DOCK6 (dedicator of cytokinesis 6) is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that plays a crucial role in the regulation of the Rho GTPases, particularly Rac1 and Cdc42. These GTPases are involved in various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal organization, cell migration, and cell division. DOCK6 is part of the DOCK-C subgroup and is known for its involvement in axonal extension and vascular smooth muscle cell migration (Li2018miR148b3p; Chen2020The).

In healthy human cells, DOCK6 is expressed in sensory neurons and is essential for proper neuronal development. It promotes axonal outgrowth by activating Rac1 and Cdc42, which are critical for actin cytoskeleton reorganization and actin polymerization, processes vital for cell morphology and migration (Li2018miR148b3p; Chen2020The). DOCK6 is also involved in maintaining the contractile phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells, which is important for vascular development and homeostasis (Benson2021The).

DOCK6 activity is regulated by phosphorylation, with AKT-mediated phosphorylation inhibiting its GEF activity, while dephosphorylation by PP2A promotes activation of RAC1 and CDC42 (Benson2021The). This regulation is crucial for its function in cellular processes related to cell movement and structure.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DOCK6 gene are associated with Adams-Oliver syndrome (AOS), a rare developmental disorder characterized by aplasia cutis congenita and terminal transverse limb defects. These mutations often result in a loss of function or expression of the DOCK6 protein, leading to various phenotypes such as scalp defects, congenital heart defects, brain anomalies, microcephaly, ocular anomalies, and cognitive impairments (Shaheen2011Recessive; Sukalo2015DOCK6Mutations). DOCK6 mutations are distributed throughout the gene and can lead to truncated proteins or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (Sukalo2015DOCK6Mutations).

In addition to AOS, alterations in DOCK6 expression have been implicated in gastric cancer (GC). DOCK6 is overexpressed in GC tissues, particularly in lymph node metastases, and is associated with poor prognosis, including shorter overall survival. The gene promotes GC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by activating Rac1 and Cdc42, which are critical in tumor progression. The microRNA miR-148b-3p negatively regulates DOCK6 expression, and its lower levels in GC tissues correlate with increased DOCK6 expression and poorer patient outcomes (Li2018miR148b3p).

## Interactions
DOCK6 interacts with several proteins and is involved in various cellular processes through these interactions. It functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the small GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42, which are crucial for actin cytoskeleton reorganization and cell motility (Shaheen2011Recessive; Li2018miR148b3p). In the context of axon growth, DOCK6 is regulated by phosphorylation. Akt1 phosphorylates DOCK6 at Ser1194, inhibiting its GEF activity, while the phosphatase Ppp2ca dephosphorylates it, promoting activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 (Laurin2014Insights; Benson2021The).

DOCK6 is also involved in the TGF-β signaling pathway, where its expression is down-regulated by the microRNA mir-142-3p, affecting cell migration in vascular smooth muscle cells (Benson2021The). In gastric cancer, DOCK6 promotes cell migration and invasion by activating Rac1 and Cdc42, and its expression is negatively regulated by miR-148b-3p, which binds to its 3'-UTR (Li2018miR148b3p).

Mutations in DOCK6 have been linked to Adams-Oliver syndrome, affecting actin cytoskeletal dynamics and leading to various developmental defects (Shaheen2011Recessive; Wang2019Novel). These interactions highlight DOCK6's role in cellular signaling and structural organization.
