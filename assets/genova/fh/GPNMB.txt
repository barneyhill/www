# GPNMB

## Overview
GPNMB, or glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B, is a gene that encodes a type I transmembrane glycoprotein involved in a variety of cellular processes. The protein, also referred to as glycoprotein nmb, is characterized by its complex structure, which includes domains such as the polycystic kidney disease-like domain and kringle-like domain, contributing to its role in protein binding and cellular interactions (Chrystal2021Functional; Hoashi2010Glycoprotein). GPNMB is expressed in multiple tissues, including the skin, brain, and bone, where it plays significant roles in cellular adhesion, neuroprotection, and bone mineralization (Biswas2020GPNMB; Saade2021The). The protein is also implicated in pathological conditions, such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, where its expression levels and interactions influence disease progression and prognosis (Taya2018Glycoprotein; Budge2017Glycoprotein). Through its involvement in key signaling pathways, GPNMB contributes to both protective and pathological processes, highlighting its dual role in health and disease (Saade2021The).

## Structure
Glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein b (GPNMB) is a type I transmembrane protein with a complex molecular structure. Its primary structure consists of 588 amino acids, including a signal peptide for entry into the secretory pathway, a polycystic kidney disease-like domain (PKD), and a kringle-like domain (KRG) involved in protein binding interactions (Chrystal2021Functional; Hoashi2010Glycoprotein). The PKD domain is heavily glycosylated, which affects its function in protein sorting and trafficking (Theos2013The). 

GPNMB's secondary structure includes immunoglobulin-like folding within the PKD domain (Hoashi2010Glycoprotein). The tertiary structure is characterized by its three-dimensional folding, which includes several domains such as the N-terminal domain (NTD), GAP1, GAP2, and C-terminal domain (CTD) (Hoashi2010Glycoprotein). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including N-glycosylation at 12 potential sites, which influences its localization and function (Hoashi2010Glycoprotein; Theos2013The).

GPNMB also has splice variant isoforms, with one isoform containing an additional 12-amino acid insert in the GAP2 region, likely generated by alternative splicing (Hoashi2010Glycoprotein). The protein is subject to proteolytic ectodomain shedding, regulated by intracellular signaling pathways (Hoashi2010Glycoprotein).

## Function
GPNMB, also known as Glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B, is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein involved in various cellular functions. In healthy human cells, GPNMB is expressed in multiple tissues, including the skin, brain, breasts, muscle, and bone. It plays roles in cellular adhesion through integrin, regulation of the extracellular matrix in skeletal muscles, bone mineralization, and osteoclast and osteoblast differentiation (Biswas2020GPNMB; Saade2021The). In the skin, GPNMB is predominantly expressed in melanocytes and is regulated by the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). It is present in all stages of melanosomes and is critical for pigmentation, functioning as an adhesion protein between melanocytes and keratinocytes (Biswas2020GPNMB).

GPNMB is also involved in neuroprotection, particularly in the brain, where it interacts with several molecules and receptors to influence intracellular signaling pathways. It promotes neuroprotection against oxidative stress through the activation of ERK/MEK and AKT/PI3K pathways (Saade2021The). Additionally, GPNMB has roles in promoting M2-macrophage polarization and protecting against ischemia-reperfusion injury, suggesting its protective and regulatory role in inflammation and neurodegenerative conditions (Saade2021The).

## Clinical Significance
GPNMB (glycoprotein nmb) is implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression and interactions. In cancer, GPNMB is highly expressed in several tumor types, including melanoma, glioblastoma, and triple-negative breast cancer, where it is associated with aggressive tumor behaviors such as proliferation, migration, and invasion (Taya2018Glycoprotein). High GPNMB expression is linked to poor prognosis in glioma and bladder cancer, with its expression correlating with advanced tumor grade and shorter survival times (Taya2018Glycoprotein; Feng2020High). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), GPNMB enhances the migratory and invasive abilities of cells, particularly in the presence of EGFR mutations, suggesting its role in promoting metastasis (Han2021N‐glycosylated).

In neurodegenerative diseases, GPNMB is elevated in conditions like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), where it provides neuroprotection and is considered a biomarker for disease severity (Budge2017Glycoprotein). Its expression is also increased in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, where it may play a protective role by modulating inflammatory responses (Saade2021The). GPNMB's involvement in inflammation is complex, with studies suggesting both anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory actions, depending on the context (Saade2021The).

## Interactions
Glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B (GPNMB) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with the alpha subunits of Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA), which acts as a receptor for its extracellular fragment. This interaction activates the PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK pathways, contributing to neuroprotective effects and altering cellular membrane potential (Ono2016Glycoprotein). GPNMB also binds to the voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), although this interaction is less emphasized due to VDAC1's mitochondrial localization (Ono2016Glycoprotein).

In cancer, GPNMB interacts with integrins, particularly the tumor-specific integrin α5β1, through its RGD motif, promoting metastasis via the FAK/Src pathway (Taya2018Glycoprotein). It also forms complexes with receptor tyrosine kinases like Neuropilin-1 and EGFR, enhancing VEGF receptor signaling and tumor growth (Taya2018Glycoprotein). GPNMB's interaction with CD44 in the tumor microenvironment activates survival pathways, leading to increased cancer stem cell properties and metastasis (Liguori2020The). These interactions highlight GPNMB's role in modulating signaling pathways that contribute to its functions in neuroprotection and cancer progression.
