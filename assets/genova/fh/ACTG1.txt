# ACTG1

## Overview
The ACTG1 gene encodes the gamma-actin protein, a member of the actin family, which is a group of highly conserved proteins that play a critical role in the cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells. Gamma-actin, specifically, is a cytoplasmic actin isoform that is essential for maintaining the structural integrity and function of non-muscle cells. It is involved in various cellular processes, including cell shape changes, motility, and vesicle trafficking, by forming filamentous structures known as F-actin through the polymerization of actin monomers (Morín2009In). In addition to its structural role, gamma-actin is crucial in the auditory system, particularly in cochlear hair cells, where it contributes to mechanotransduction. Mutations in the ACTG1 gene are linked to progressive hearing loss and other clinical conditions, highlighting its significance in both cellular and physiological contexts (Morín2009In; Miyagawa2015Mutational).

## Structure
The ACTG1 gene encodes the gamma-actin protein, which is part of the highly conserved actin family. The primary structure of gamma-actin is characterized by a sequence of amino acids that is highly conserved across different isoforms, with specific differences between cytoplasmic and muscle actins (Ampe2016Mammalian). The secondary structure of actin includes alpha-helices, beta-strands, beta-turns, and loops, organized into a hexokinase superfold (Ampe2016Mammalian). 

The tertiary structure of actin is divided into large and small domains, with the nucleotide (ATP or ADP) and divalent metal ion (Mg2+ or Ca2+) binding between these domains. The actin molecule is further divided into four subdomains, with subdomain 1 containing the N and C termini (Ampe2016Mammalian). 

In terms of quaternary structure, actin forms filamentous structures (F-actin) through interactions between protomers, with specific residues making longitudinal and transverse contacts (Ampe2016Mammalian). Post-translational modifications of actin include acetylation at the N terminus and methylation of His73, although the specific roles of these modifications are not well understood (Ampe2016Mammalian). 

Gamma-actin is involved in forming polarized filamentous structures known as F-actin, which have a two-stranded helix or a single left-handed helix structure (Ampe2016Mammalian).

## Function
The ACTG1 gene encodes gamma-actin, a cytoplasmic actin isoform that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structure and function of the cytoskeleton in non-muscle cells. Gamma-actin is involved in forming actin filaments (F-actin) through the polymerization of actin monomers (G-actin), which are essential for various cellular processes such as cell shape changes, motility, and vesicle trafficking (Morín2009In). In healthy human cells, gamma-actin is critical for cell motility and polarity, influencing processes like wound healing and directed cell migration. Its knockdown results in reduced cell speed and disrupted cell polarity, as evidenced by the misorientation of the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) (Shum2011γ‐Actin).

Gamma-actin also plays a significant role in the auditory system, particularly in cochlear hair cells, where it is a major component of the stereocilia. These actin-based structures are vital for mechanotransduction, the process of converting sound waves into electrical signals, and mutations in ACTG1 are linked to progressive hearing loss (Morín2009In). In muscle cells, gamma-actin contributes to maintaining cellular structure, and its absence can lead to skeletal myopathy, characterized by decreased mobility and muscle cell necrosis (Wang2013Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ACTG1 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss (DFNA20/26) and Baraitser-Winter syndrome (B-WS). DFNA20/26 is characterized by progressive sensorineural hearing loss, often beginning in the first or second decade of life and initially affecting high frequencies (van2003A; Miyagawa2015Mutational). The hearing loss progresses over time, potentially leading to profound impairment (Rendtorff2006A). Specific mutations, such as Thr278Ile and p.V370A, have been identified in families with this condition, affecting actin polymerization and hair cell structure in the ear (van2003A; Rendtorff2006A).

Baraitser-Winter syndrome, linked to some ACTG1 mutations, is a developmental disorder that includes features such as congenital ptosis, high-arched eyebrows, brain malformations, and variable hearing loss (Park2013Multiphasic). The phenotypic expression of ACTG1 mutations is highly variable, with some individuals exhibiting full-blown B-WS symptoms while others present with isolated non-syndromic deafness (Dawidziuk2022De). This variability suggests that the conditions may reflect different manifestations of undiagnosed B-WS (Dawidziuk2022De).

## Interactions
ACTG1 (actin gamma 1) is known to participate in several critical protein interactions that are essential for cellular processes. It forms a complex with the FHL1 protein and non-muscle myosin IIB (Myh10), which plays a significant role in muscle development and function. This interaction was identified through immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, highlighting the importance of these proteins in maintaining muscle cellular architecture (Wang2013Identification).

Gamma-actin, encoded by ACTG1, is a cytoskeletal protein that interacts with non-muscle myosin IIB, which is crucial for cell motility, adhesion, and shape. The interaction between ACTG1 and Myh10 is essential for cellular processes such as migration and cytokinesis, underscoring the role of ACTG1 in muscle structure and function (Wang2013Identification).

The study also confirmed the co-localization of FHL1 with gamma-actin and non-muscle myosin IIB in adult rat gastrocnemius muscle tissues, supporting the existence of these protein complexes in vivo (Wang2013Identification). These interactions suggest that ACTG1 is integral to the structural integrity and function of muscle cells.
