# TRMT2A

## Overview
TRMT2A is a gene that encodes the protein tRNA methyltransferase 2 homolog A, which is a member of the methyltransferase enzyme family. This protein is primarily involved in the post-transcriptional modification of tRNA, specifically catalyzing the formation of 5-methyluridine (m5U) at position 54 in cytosolic tRNAs. This modification is crucial for maintaining tRNA stability and proper folding, which are essential for accurate protein synthesis in human cells (Witzenberger2022Human; Pereira2021m5U54). The TRMT2A protein is characterized by an N-terminal RNA recognition motif and a C-terminal S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) methyltransferase domain, which are conserved features across the TrmA family (Chang2019TRMT2A). Predominantly localized in the nucleus, TRMT2A plays a significant role in translation fidelity and cell cycle regulation, with its expression peaking during the S-phase (Chang2019TRMT2A). Additionally, TRMT2A is implicated in broader cellular pathways, including RNA biogenesis and stress response, highlighting its multifunctional roles beyond tRNA modification (Witzenberger2022Human).

## Structure
The TRMT2A protein is a homolog of the yeast Trm2p and E. coli TrmA, featuring an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM) and a C-terminal class I S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) methyltransferase domain, which is conserved across the TrmA family (Chang2019TRMT2A). The RRM is involved in RNA binding and is characterized by a typical fold with a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and two α-helices (Witzenberger2024Crystal). The methyltransferase domain is responsible for the methylation of uridine in tRNA, specifically at position 54, using SAM as a methyl donor (Witzenberger2022Human).

The protein is predominantly localized in the nucleus, supported by a nuclear localization signal (NLS) (Chang2019TRMT2A). TRMT2A is involved in post-transcriptional modification of tRNA and contributes to translation fidelity (Witzenberger2022Human). The protein's expression is cell cycle-dependent, peaking in the S-phase, and its overexpression can retard cell proliferation, indicating a role in cell cycle regulation (Chang2019TRMT2A). The human TRMT2A shares 81% identity with its mouse counterpart, suggesting a conserved function in mammals (Chang2019TRMT2A).

## Function
The TRMT2A gene encodes a tRNA methyltransferase responsible for catalyzing the formation of 5-methyluridine (m5U) at position 54 in cytosolic tRNAs. This modification is crucial for maintaining tRNA stability and proper folding, which are essential for accurate protein synthesis in human cells (Witzenberger2022Human; Pereira2021m5U54). TRMT2A's activity ensures translation fidelity by preventing mistranslation during protein synthesis, as demonstrated by increased mistranslation rates in TRMT2A knockdown cells (Witzenberger2022Human).

TRMT2A is primarily active in the nucleus and cytoplasm, with significant localization in the nucleolus, suggesting its involvement in rRNA processing and ribosome biogenesis (Witzenberger2022Human). The enzyme binds strongly to tRNAs, particularly those with uridine at position 54, indicating a specific role in tRNA methylation (Witzenberger2022Human). TRMT2A also interacts with various proteins involved in RNA biogenesis, suggesting potential multifunctional roles beyond tRNA modification (Witzenberger2022Human).

In healthy human cells, TRMT2A plays a critical role in maintaining tRNA stability and preventing degradation, which is vital for efficient protein synthesis and cellular homeostasis (Pereira2021m5U54). Its function is particularly important under stress conditions, where it helps modulate the cellular stress response by maintaining tRNA integrity (Pereira2021m5U54).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TRMT2A gene have been linked to various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer. In HER2-positive breast cancer, TRMT2A expression is associated with an increased risk of recurrence. Studies have shown that TRMT2A expression, identified by cytoplasmic staining in more than 10% of cells, serves as a significant prognostic marker for recurrence-free survival in these patients. This suggests that TRMT2A could be used as a biomarker to identify HER2-positive breast cancer patients at higher risk of recurrence, independent of other clinical and pathological factors (Hicks2010The).

TRMT2A is also implicated in stress response pathways. Its expression is affected by oxidative stress, and its silencing leads to the generation of tRNA-derived small RNAs, which are linked to decreased protein synthesis and cellular stress responses. This indicates a potential role for TRMT2A in stress adaptation and its involvement in diseases related to cellular stress, such as cancer and neurological disorders (Pereira2021m5U54). The interplay between TRMT2A and angiogenin (ANG) further supports its role in stress response, as TRMT2A expression increases when ANG is silenced (Pereira2021m5U54).

## Interactions
The human TRMT2A protein is involved in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. TRMT2A primarily functions as a tRNA methyltransferase, methylating tRNA at the 5-methyluridine position, which is crucial for tRNA stability and function (Witzenberger2022Human). It interacts with tRNA molecules, specifically binding to tRNA Gln and tRNA Phe, and requires multiple domains for effective binding (Witzenberger2022Human). 

TRMT2A's protein interactome has been studied using proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID) and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) techniques. These studies identified several proteins that interact with TRMT2A, including those involved in RNA and nucleic acid metabolic processes (Witzenberger2022Human). Notably, proteins such as SSB, TARBP2, and SPINDOC were identified as high-confidence interaction partners (Witzenberger2022Human). 

The enzyme also shows low specificity in binding to various RNA structures, including stem-loop structured RNAs, suggesting potential roles beyond tRNA methylation, such as acting as a tRNA chaperone (Witzenberger2022Human). These interactions highlight TRMT2A's involvement in broader cellular pathways, including RNA biogenesis and translation fidelity (Witzenberger2022Human).
