# AMDHD1

## Overview
The AMDHD1 gene encodes the protein amidohydrolase domain containing 1, which is a member of the amidohydrolase superfamily. This protein is characterized by its (β/α)8-barrel structural fold and is involved in the hydrolysis of amide bonds, playing a crucial role in various metabolic pathways, including those of histidine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and vitamin D (Song2013Identification; Seibert2005Structural). AMDHD1 is primarily expressed in the liver, where it contributes to liver-specific metabolic functions and is regulated by factors such as dietary conditions and microRNA miR-122 (Song2013Identification). The protein also interacts with key components of the TGF-β signaling pathway, influencing cell proliferation and migration, particularly in the context of cancer (Ma2024AMDHD1). As a result, AMDHD1 has been identified as a potential tumor suppressor and prognostic marker in various cancers, including cholangiocarcinoma (Ma2024AMDHD1).

## Structure
The AMDHD1 protein is a member of the amidohydrolase superfamily, characterized by a (β/α)8-barrel structural fold. This fold houses a mononuclear or binuclear metal center, which is crucial for the enzyme's catalytic activity. The metal center activates the scissile bond of the substrate for cleavage and enhances the hydrolytic water molecule for nucleophilic attack (Pieper2009Target; Seibert2005Structural). The active site of the protein is formed by loops at the C-terminal ends of the beta-strands, which are essential for substrate interaction and specificity (Pieper2009Target; Seibert2005Structural).

The structural diversity within the amidohydrolase superfamily, including AMDHD1, is attributed to the variability of these loops, which vary significantly in sequence, length, and conformation. This variability is essential for the diverse catalytic functions of the superfamily (Seibert2005Structural). The primary active site architecture is conserved for hydroxide production and delivery, while the loops contribute to substrate specificity (Seibert2005Structural). The protein's structure does not specifically mention post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms in the provided context.

## Function
The AMDHD1 gene encodes a protein involved in the metabolism of histidine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and vitamin D, playing a significant role in cellular metabolic processes (Ma2024AMDHD1). In healthy human cells, AMDHD1 is primarily active in the liver, where it is highly expressed and contributes to liver-specific functions such as histidine metabolism (Song2013Identification). The protein is involved in the hydrolysis of amide bonds, which is crucial for the regulation of metabolic pathways (Song2013Identification).

AMDHD1 is also implicated in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism, as its expression is affected by dietary conditions and genetic factors, such as in SCD1 null mice (Song2013Identification). The gene's expression is negatively regulated by microRNA miR-122, which is highly expressed in the liver, suggesting a role in liver development and regeneration (Song2013Identification). Although specific functions in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, AMDHD1's involvement in these metabolic pathways indicates its importance in maintaining liver function and overall metabolic homeostasis (Song2013Identification).

## Clinical Significance
The AMDHD1 gene has been implicated in various cancers, particularly cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), where its down-regulation is associated with poor clinical outcomes. In CCA, low AMDHD1 expression correlates with adverse features such as poor tumor differentiation, perineural invasion, elevated CA19-9 levels, and advanced TNM stage. It is also linked to worse overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in patients, making it an independent prognostic risk factor for these outcomes (Ma2024AMDHD1). 

AMDHD1 acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting CCA cell proliferation and migration, and its overexpression has been shown to reduce tumor growth and metastasis. Mechanistically, AMDHD1 disrupts the G1/S phase progression via the p21/CDK4 pathway and triggers apoptosis in CCA cells. It enhances TGF-β signaling by interacting with SMAD4 and SMAD2/3 proteins, preventing their degradation and promoting their phosphorylation, which is crucial for inhibiting CCA cell viability and migration (Ma2024AMDHD1).

Beyond CCA, low AMDHD1 expression is associated with poorer OS in other cancer types, including kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, sarcoma, skin cutaneous melanoma, and uveal melanoma (Ma2024AMDHD1). These findings suggest that AMDHD1 may serve as a potential therapeutic target and prognostic marker in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
AMDHD1 interacts with several key proteins within the TGF-β signaling pathway, playing a significant role in modulating this pathway. It directly interacts with SMAD4 through the MH2 domain, preventing its ubiquitination and degradation, which stabilizes SMAD4 protein levels (Ma2024AMDHD1). This interaction is crucial for AMDHD1's tumor-suppressing effects in cholangiocarcinoma, as SMAD4 mediates the effects of AMDHD1 on cell proliferation and migration (Ma2024AMDHD1).

AMDHD1 also interacts with SMAD2 and SMAD3, promoting their phosphorylation, which is essential for their function in the TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway. This interaction enhances the nuclear translocation of SMAD2/3, further activating TGF-β signaling (Ma2024AMDHD1). The phosphorylation of SMAD2/3 is necessary for their interaction with AMDHD1, as demonstrated by the inability of SMAD2-A and SMAD3-A mutants to interact with AMDHD1 (Ma2024AMDHD1).

These interactions suggest that AMDHD1 may act as a scaffold protein, facilitating the integration and nuclear translocation of SMAD proteins, thereby influencing cell cycle, apoptosis, and invasion dynamics in cholangiocarcinoma (Ma2024AMDHD1).
