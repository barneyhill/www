# FBLN1

## Overview
FBLN1 is a gene that encodes the protein fibulin-1, a secreted glycoprotein integral to the extracellular matrix (ECM). Fibulin-1 is characterized by its fibulin-like C-terminal domain and multiple calcium-binding epidermal growth factor (EGF) modules, which facilitate its interaction with various ECM components, such as fibronectin, laminin, and type IV collagen (Segade2010Molecular; Castagnoli2011FBLN1). This protein plays a pivotal role in cell adhesion, tissue organization, and the structural integrity of the ECM. Fibulin-1 exists in several isoforms, including FBLN1C and FBLN1D, which have distinct functions in different tissues (Segade2010Molecular). The gene's expression and the protein's interactions are implicated in various physiological processes and pathological conditions, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and developmental disorders (Harikrishnan2020Cell; Debeer2002The).

## Structure
Fibulin-1 (FBLN1) is a secreted glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in the extracellular matrix (ECM), particularly in cell adhesion and tissue organization. The protein is characterized by a unique fibulin-like C-terminal domain, known as the 'FC domain,' which is preceded by a tandem array of calcium-binding epidermal growth factor (EGF) modules (Segade2010Molecular). These EGF-like domains contribute to the protein's ability to interact with various ECM components, such as fibronectin, laminin subunits, nidogen, and type IV collagen proteins (Castagnoli2011FBLN1).

Fibulin-1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which may influence its function and interactions within the ECM. The protein exists in several splice variant isoforms, such as FBLN1C and FBLN1D, which have distinct roles in different tissues. For instance, FBLN1D is involved in the assembly of flexible tracks in nematodes, which are functionally homologous to the elastic fibers of vertebrates (Segade2010Molecular).

Fibulin-1 can homomultimerize and form complexes with other ECM components, contributing to its role in organizing ECM supramolecular structures. This multimerization is part of its quaternary structure, allowing it to function as a bridge in ECM organization (Castagnoli2011FBLN1).

## Function
Fibulin-1 (FBLN1) is a glycoprotein that plays a significant role in the organization and function of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in healthy human cells. It is involved in the supramolecular organization of ECM structures, particularly the basement membrane, by interacting with various ECM components such as fibronectin, laminin subunits, nidogen, aggrecan core protein, versican core protein, and type IV collagen proteins (Castagnoli2011FBLN1). This interaction facilitates cell adhesion and migration along protein fibers within the ECM, which is crucial for developmental processes and maintaining tissue architecture (Castagnoli2011FBLN1).

Fibulin-1 is also implicated in hemostasis and thrombosis due to its ability to bind fibrinogen and incorporate into clots (Castagnoli2011FBLN1). In the lungs, fibulin-1 contributes to the structural integrity and function of the ECM, with its isoform FBLN1C playing a role in cell attachment, proliferation, and ECM deposition, particularly in lung fibroblasts (Ge2015Fibulin1C). This suggests its involvement in lung tissue remodeling and fibrosis, which are features of chronic lung diseases (Ge2015Fibulin1C). Fibulin-1 is also associated with the elasticity of the aorta, with its expression levels influencing aortic stiffness (Yasmin2018The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FBLN1 gene, which encodes the fibulin-1 protein, have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In cancer, fibulin-1 exhibits both tumor-suppressive and oncogenic roles depending on the tissue context. It is overexpressed in certain cancers like breast and ovarian cancer, where it may promote tumor growth and invasion (Castagnoli2011FBLN1). Conversely, fibulin-1 is downregulated in non-small cell lung cancer, where its loss is associated with increased activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and poor prognosis (Harikrishnan2020Cell). In bladder cancer, fibulin-1 is epigenetically downregulated, correlating with higher recurrence rates and suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (Xiao2014Fibulin1).

Fibulin-1 is also involved in cardiovascular diseases. Its downregulation may contribute to acute aortic dissection by weakening the extracellular matrix in the aorta (Castagnoli2011FBLN1). In synpolydactyly, a chromosomal translocation affecting the FBLN1-D isoform leads to reduced expression, suggesting that a balanced expression of fibulin-1 isoforms is crucial for normal limb development (Debeer2002The). These findings underscore the diverse roles of fibulin-1 in disease pathogenesis.

## Interactions
Fibulin-1 (FBLN1) is an extracellular matrix protein that engages in various interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes and tissue organization. It interacts with several extracellular matrix components, including fibronectin, laminin subunits alpha-1 and alpha-2, nidogen, aggrecan core protein, versican core protein, and type IV collagen proteins (Castagnoli2011FBLN1). These interactions contribute to the structural integrity and organization of the extracellular matrix.

FBLN1 also interacts with amyloid beta A4, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 9, fibrinogen, and human papillomavirus proteins, suggesting its involvement in diverse biological processes such as cell adhesion, migration, and developmental processes (Castagnoli2011FBLN1). In the context of cancer, FBLN1 isoforms, particularly FBLN1C and FBLN1D, have been shown to interact with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in lung cancer cells. This interaction inhibits EGFR activation and function, influencing cell adhesion and migration (Harikrishnan2020Cell).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, FBLN1 is associated with the Notch signaling pathway, where it influences the cleavage and activation of Notch1, affecting tumor progression and apoptosis (Gong2020Increased). These interactions highlight the multifaceted roles of FBLN1 in cellular signaling and disease progression.
