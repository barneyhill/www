# FRY

## Overview
The FRY gene encodes the FRY microtubule binding protein, which is integral to various cellular processes, particularly those involving the cytoskeleton. This protein is categorized as a microtubule-associated protein and is crucial for maintaining cell structure and facilitating cell division by ensuring proper chromosome alignment and spindle organization during mitosis (Liu2019Fry). In addition to its role in cell cycle progression, FRY is involved in mammary gland development and interacts with the Hippo/Yap signaling pathway, which is significant for cell proliferation and differentiation (Liu2019Fry). The protein's interactions with other proteins, such as the Tricornered kinase and Mob proteins, highlight its involvement in morphogenetic processes, particularly in Drosophila (Fang2010The; He2005DrosophilaMob). Furthermore, FRY's potential role in tumor suppression and modulation of cancer cell behavior underscores its clinical significance (Liu2019Fry).

## Structure


## Function
The FRY gene encodes a microtubule binding protein that plays a significant role in cell division and maintaining cell structure by interacting with microtubules. In mammals, FRY is involved in chromosome alignment, spindle organization, and the stability of microtubules during mitosis, which are crucial for proper cell cycle progression and division (Liu2019Fry). The protein is active in the cytoplasm, particularly during spindle formation, contributing to proper chromosome segregation and cellular stability.

FRY is also implicated in mammary gland development, particularly during pregnancy. It is essential for proper differentiation and development of the mammary gland, with its deficiency leading to differentiation defects (Liu2019Fry). The protein interacts with the Hippo/Yap signaling pathway, which regulates cell proliferation and differentiation. FRY increases the phosphorylation of key signaling molecules in this pathway, such as MST1 and LATS1, suggesting a role in tumor suppression and cell growth regulation (Liu2019Fry).

In breast cancer cell lines, ectopic expression of FRY alters cell morphology and suppresses growth and proliferation, indicating its potential role in modulating cancer cell behavior (Liu2019Fry). However, the specific molecular interactions of FRY in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated.

## Interactions
The FRY protein, also known as the FRY microtubule binding protein, is involved in several interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of Drosophila. It interacts with the Tricornered (Trc) kinase, a member of the NDR kinase family, which is essential for the function of NDR kinases in vivo and for kinase activity in vitro. This interaction is crucial for the morphogenesis of epidermal hairs, sensory bristles, and dendrite arborization in Drosophila (Fang2010The; He2005DrosophilaMob). The interaction between FRY and Trc is regulated by the C-terminal region of Trc, with specific residues being essential for this interaction (Fang2010The).

FRY is also part of a complex with Mob proteins, which are related to yeast Mob proteins that bind to kinases like Cbk1 and Dbf2. These interactions suggest that FRY, Trc, and Mob proteins function together in a signaling pathway important for morphogenesis (He2005DrosophilaMob). The FRY protein is highly mobile in vivo, indicating its role in intracellular transport and polarized growth, potentially through its binding to microtubules (Fang2010The). However, specific interactions of FRY with nucleic acids have not been detailed in the available literature.
