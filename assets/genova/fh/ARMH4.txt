# ARMH4

## Overview
ARMH4 is a gene that encodes the protein armadillo-like helical domain containing 4, which is involved in immunomodulation and cytoskeletal dynamics within human cells. This protein is particularly significant in the context of kidney function, where it is expressed in podocytes, specialized cells essential for the filtration process. ARMH4 is known to interact with intracellular membranes, potentially the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus, and plays a role in regulating signaling pathways such as mTORC2, AKT, and STAT3, which are crucial for cellular responses to inflammation (De2023Identification). The expression of ARMH4 is upregulated during podocyte differentiation, indicating its importance in the maturation and function of these cells (De2023Identification). Additionally, ARMH4 has been identified as part of the late podocyte gene expression signature, further underscoring its role in mature podocyte function (Tran2019In). Changes in ARMH4 expression have been linked to various kidney diseases, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for podocyte health and its involvement in disease pathogenesis (De2023Identification).

## Function
ARMH4, also known as armadillo-like helical domain containing 4, is a protein that plays a significant role in immunomodulation and cytoskeletal dynamics in human cells, particularly in podocytes, which are specialized cells in the kidney crucial for filtration. ARMH4 acts upstream of mTORC2 to negatively regulate AKT activation and STAT3 signaling, which is predicted to have an anti-inflammatory effect. This regulatory function is supported by experiments showing that overexpression of ARMH4 in human proximal tubular cells leads to a reduction in pro-inflammatory transcripts IL-1B and IL-8, while silencing ARMH4 results in their upregulation (De2023Identification).

ARMH4 is enriched in human glomeruli and is associated with intracellular membranes, possibly the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus, in podocytes. Its expression increases during podocyte differentiation, suggesting a role in podocyte maturation and function (De2023Identification). ARMH4 is also part of the late podocyte gene expression signature, indicating its involvement in mature podocyte function (Tran2019In). In diseased kidneys, ARMH4 levels are reduced, particularly in conditions like focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, suggesting its potential as a marker of healthy podocytes (De2023Identification).

## Clinical Significance
ARMH4 has been implicated in various kidney-related diseases due to its role in immunomodulation and cytoskeletal dynamics. Alterations in ARMH4 expression have been associated with inflammatory responses in podocytes, which are crucial for kidney function. Overexpression of ARMH4 in human proximal tubular cells has been shown to reduce pro-inflammatory transcripts such as IL-1B and IL-8, suggesting its potential anti-inflammatory effects. Conversely, silencing ARMH4 leads to an increase in these inflammatory markers, indicating its role in modulating inflammation (De2023Identification).

In diseased kidneys, particularly in conditions like collapsing and classic focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), ARMH4 levels are reduced compared to normal kidneys. This reduction in ARMH4 expression is also observed in various glomerular diseases, as evidenced by decreased staining in podocytes from renal biopsies (De2023Identification). Genome-wide association studies have identified ARMH4 as a genetic marker associated with lupus nephritis, highlighting its potential clinical significance in kidney-related diseases (De2023Identification). These findings suggest that ARMH4 could serve as a marker for healthy podocytes and its downregulation may be linked to podocyte-related kidney diseases.
