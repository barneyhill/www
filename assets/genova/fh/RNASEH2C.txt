# RNASEH2C

## Overview
RNASEH2C is a gene that encodes the ribonuclease H2 subunit C, a crucial component of the ribonuclease H2 (RNase H2) complex. This complex is a heterotrimeric enzyme composed of RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, and RNASEH2C subunits, which plays a vital role in maintaining genomic stability by removing ribonucleotides misincorporated into DNA. The RNASEH2C subunit functions as a scaffolding protein, supporting the catalytic activity of the RNASEH2A subunit and contributing to the structural integrity of the complex through its interaction with RNASEH2B. This interaction forms a 'triple-barrel' motif essential for the enzyme's stability and activity (Hollis2011Structure). The RNase H2 complex is involved in cleaving RNA from RNA-DNA hybrids, such as R-loops, which can form during transcription and replication, thereby preventing genomic instability (Marsili2021Gene). Mutations in the RNASEH2C gene are linked to Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, a severe neurological disorder, and have also been implicated in cancer, highlighting the gene's significance in both genomic maintenance and disease pathogenesis (Deasy2019AicardiGoutières; Crow2016Neurologic).

## Structure
The RNASEH2C protein is a structural component of the heterotrimeric RNase H2 complex, which also includes RNase H2A and RNase H2B subunits. The RNASEH2C subunit is characterized by a secondary structure comprising 11 beta-strands and 2 alpha-helices. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the cohesion of the complex by interweaving with the N-terminal region of the RNase H2B protein to form a 'triple-barrel' motif. This motif consists of 18 parallel and antiparallel beta-strands, creating a pseudo twofold axis of symmetry, which is essential for the stability and activity of the enzyme (Hollis2011Structure).

The RNASEH2C subunit is involved in the quaternary structure of the RNase H2 complex, where it interacts with both the RNase H2A and RNase H2B subunits. The C-terminal region of the RNase H2B subunit, which is mostly alpha-helical, may interact with other proteins or facilitate DNA bending, suggesting a role in protein-protein interactions and structural support within the complex (Hollis2011Structure). The RNase H2 complex's structural similarity to the TFIIF complex implies potential roles in transcription or interaction with RNA polymerase (Hollis2011Structure).

## Function
RNASEH2C is a subunit of the ribonuclease H2 (RNase H2) complex, which plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability by removing ribonucleotides that are mistakenly incorporated into DNA. This process is essential for preventing genomic instability, which can lead to mutations and chromosomal abnormalities. The RNase H2 complex, including RNASEH2C, is involved in cleaving RNA from RNA-DNA hybrids, such as R-loops, which can form during transcription, DNA replication, and repair (Marsili2021Gene). These hybrids, if not resolved, can obstruct DNA replication and transcription, potentially causing genomic instability (Marsili2021Gene).

RNASEH2C functions as a scaffolding subunit within the RNase H2 complex, supporting the catalytic activity of RNASEH2A, the enzyme's active subunit (Deasy2019AicardiGoutières). The complex is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to DNA replication and repair processes, ensuring the integrity of the genome (Marsili2021Gene). In healthy human cells, the primary role of RNASEH2C is related to its participation in the RNase H2 complex, which is crucial for the removal of ribonucleotides from DNA, thereby maintaining genomic stability and proper cellular function (Deasy2019AicardiGoutières).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RNASEH2C gene are associated with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS), a severe neurological disorder characterized by intracranial calcification, leukoencephalopathy, and cerebral atrophy. AGS is linked to mutations in several genes, including RNASEH2C, and is marked by elevated cerebrospinal fluid interferon α activity, leading to an upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes (Crow2016Neurologic; Rice2013Assessment). Patients with RNASEH2C mutations often present with neurological dysfunction within the first year of life, exhibiting symptoms such as spasticity, dystonia, seizures, cortical blindness, progressive microcephaly, and psychomotor retardation (Crow2015Characterization).

The RNASEH2C gene has also been implicated in breast cancer metastasis. Studies suggest that reduced expression of RNASEH2C can engage a cytotoxic T cell-mediated immune response, potentially reducing metastasis. This effect appears to be independent of the enzyme's function, indicating a possible non-enzymatic role for RNASEH2C in cancer (Deasy2019AicardiGoutières). The gene's involvement in both AGS and cancer highlights its significance in immune system regulation and disease pathogenesis.

## Interactions
RNASEH2C is a subunit of the RNase H2 complex, which is a heterotrimeric enzyme composed of RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, and RNASEH2C. This complex is involved in the removal of ribonucleotides from DNA and plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability. RNASEH2C interacts with RNASEH2A and RNASEH2B to form a stable and functional enzyme complex. The RNASEH2B and RNASEH2C subunits interweave to form a structural motif known as a 'triple-barrel,' which is essential for the enzyme's stability and activity (Hollis2011Structure).

RNASEH2C also participates in interactions with RNA polymerase II (Pol II), which enhances transcription. This interaction is part of the RNase H2 complex's role in resolving co-transcriptional R-loops, structures that can lead to DNA damage if not properly managed (Cristini2022RNase). The RNase H2 complex, including RNASEH2C, is associated with chromatin as a trimeric complex and is enriched in both non-coding and protein-coding genes, indicating its widespread involvement in transcription regulation (Cristini2022RNase). These interactions highlight the importance of RNASEH2C in both structural and functional aspects of the RNase H2 complex.
