# SERTAD2

## Overview
SERTAD2, also known as TRIP-Br2, is a gene that encodes the protein SERTA domain containing 2, which functions as a transcriptional coregulator. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of E2F-mediated transcriptional activities, playing a crucial role in cell cycle progression and tumorigenesis. As a member of the TRIP-Br/SERTAD family, SERTAD2 modulates the expression of key E2F-responsive genes, thereby influencing cellular proliferation and differentiation (Cheong2009TRIPBr2). The protein is active in the nucleus and interacts with other proteins, such as I-mfa, to regulate transcriptional activities and pathways critical for cell growth, such as the cyclinD$CDK4/p16 INK4a/E2F cascade (Kusano2011Imfa). Dysregulation of SERTAD2 has been implicated in various cancers, highlighting its significance in clinical oncology (Chen2022REV1; Zhu2023The).

## Function
SERTAD2, also known as TRIP-Br2, is a transcriptional coregulator involved in E2F-mediated cell cycle progression and tumorigenesis. It is a member of the TRIP-Br/SERTAD family, which modulates E2F-dependent transcriptional activities. SERTAD2 is known to upregulate key E2F-responsive genes such as CYCLIN E, CYCLIN A2, CDC6, and DHFR, which are crucial for cell cycle progression (Cheong2009TRIPBr2). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it influences gene expression, impacting cellular proliferation and differentiation.

SERTAD2 interacts with other proteins, such as I-mfa, which can repress its transcriptional activity. This interaction affects the nuclear translocation and transcriptional activities of SERTAD2, suggesting a role in regulating the cyclinD$CDK4/p16 INK4a/E2F cascade, a key pathway in cell growth and proliferation (Kusano2011Imfa). The protein's involvement in these molecular processes highlights its role in cell biology, particularly in the regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis. SERTAD2's activity in these pathways underscores its potential impact on organismal outcomes, such as tumorigenesis, when dysregulated (Cheong2009TRIPBr2).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SERTAD2 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In lung cancer, SERTAD2 is overexpressed and functions as an oncogene, promoting tumorigenesis by upregulating E2F response genes. Silencing SERTAD2 in lung cancer cells inhibits their proliferation, indicating its critical role in cancer progression. The regulation of SERTAD2 by the REV1 gene, through the Rad18/SERTAD2 signaling axis, further underscores its involvement in lung tumorigenesis (Chen2022REV1).

In pancreatic cancer, SERTAD2 is also significantly overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal controls. This overexpression is associated with the occurrence and metastasis of pancreatic cancer, suggesting its potential role in the disease's pathogenesis. SERTAD2 is included in a prognostic risk model for pancreatic adenocarcinoma, where its high expression correlates with worse overall survival outcomes (Zhu2023The).

In ovarian cancer, low expression levels of lnc-SERTAD2-3, a long non-coding RNA associated with SERTAD2, are linked to longer progression-free and overall survival, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Zhan2018Long). Additionally, structural variations affecting SERTAD2 have been associated with adverse outcomes in multiple myeloma (Ashby2022Structural).

## Interactions
SERTAD2, a transcriptional coregulator, is known to be overexpressed in various human tumors and plays a role in promoting tumorigenesis. It is regulated by the gene REV1, which influences SERTAD2 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. This regulation is partially dependent on Rad18, a molecule involved in translesion synthesis (TLS). In lung cancer cells, the expression of Rad18 and other TLS-related molecules is downregulated when REV1 is silenced, indicating a connection between these proteins. Positive correlations have been observed between the expression of Rad18 and SERTAD2 in lung adenocarcinoma. Functional experiments have shown that the proliferation of lung cancer cells induced by REV1 overexpression can be reversed by Rad18 deletion. Additionally, overexpression of SERTAD2 can partially restore the inhibitory effect of Rad18 silencing on cell proliferation. These findings suggest that SERTAD2 is part of a signaling axis involving REV1 and Rad18, which promotes lung tumorigenesis (Chen2022REV1).
