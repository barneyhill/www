# VILL

## Overview
The VILL gene encodes the protein villin-like, which is a member of the villin/gelsolin family of actin-modulating proteins. Villin-like is primarily involved in the regulation of actin dynamics, playing a crucial role in the organization and remodeling of the cytoskeleton. It is characterized as an actin-binding protein, with the ability to sever, cap, and bundle actin filaments, depending on the cellular context and calcium ion concentration (Arpin1988Sequence; Bazari1988Villin). The protein's structural domains, including a core and a headpiece, facilitate its diverse functions in actin filament modulation, contributing to cellular processes such as morphogenesis and motility (Friederich1992An; Bazari1988Villin). Villin-like's activity is finely tuned by calcium levels, which dictate its transition between filament-severing and bundling states, underscoring its importance in cellular adaptability and response to environmental changes (Hampton2008The).

## Structure
The VILL protein, encoded by the human gene VILL, is structurally organized into several domains that facilitate its role in actin-binding and cytoskeletal organization. The protein consists of a core and a headpiece domain. The core is composed of six homologous domains, each containing conserved sequences that are also found in other actin-severing proteins like gelsolin, severin, and fragmin (Bazari1988Villin). These domains are characterized by repeated sequences that contribute to the protein's actin-severing and capping functions (Bazari1988Villin).

The headpiece domain, distinct from the core, is crucial for actin filament bundling and contains a conserved COOH-terminal cluster of charged amino acids, including the KKEK motif, which is essential for its morphogenic activity (Friederich1992An). This domain is highly thermostable and does not contain disulfide bonds, indicating a compact and stable conformation (Doering1996Cysteine).

VILL's interaction with actin is regulated by calcium concentrations, with low calcium levels promoting bundling and high levels leading to severing (Arpin1988Sequence). The protein's structure allows it to adapt to different filament geometries, enhancing its functional versatility (Hampton2008The).
