# HMGB1

## Overview
The HMGB1 gene encodes the high mobility group box 1 protein, a non-histone chromosomal protein that plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes. As a member of the high mobility group (HMG) protein family, HMGB1 is characterized by its ability to bind DNA in a non-sequence specific manner, facilitating chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation (Štros2010HMGB; Knapp2004The). The protein is involved in DNA repair, nucleosome stabilization, and the modulation of gene expression through its interactions with DNA and other nuclear proteins (Dintilhac2002HMGB1; Mandke2019Interactions). Beyond its nuclear functions, HMGB1 acts as a proinflammatory cytokine in the extracellular environment, engaging with receptors such as RAGE and Toll-Like Receptors to mediate immune responses and tissue regeneration (Yang2013The; Naglova2012HMGB1). Due to its diverse roles, HMGB1 is implicated in various pathological conditions, including inflammatory diseases, autoimmune disorders, and cancer, making it a significant focus of biomedical research (Tripathi2019HMGB1; Kang2014HMGB1).

## Structure
The HMGB1 protein is composed of 215 amino acid residues and features a tripartite domain organization, including two DNA-binding domains known as HMG box A and box B, and a C-terminal acidic tail. Each HMG box is approximately 75 amino acids long and consists of three alpha-helices arranged in an L-like shape, stabilized by hydrophobic cores (Rodionova2009Changes; Knapp2004The). The boxes are connected by a short linker region, and the acidic tail is composed of glutamic and aspartic acids (Knapp2004The).

The secondary structure of HMGB1 is predominantly alpha-helical, with the acidic tail forming a random coil (Knapp2004The). The tertiary structure is characterized by the flexibility of the HMG boxes, which are rotationally free with respect to each other, allowing dynamic interactions with DNA (Knapp2004The). The acidic tail interacts with specific residues within and between the HMG boxes, modulating DNA interaction and chromatin remodeling (Knapp2004The).

Post-translational modifications, such as acetylation and redox changes, play crucial roles in HMGB1's function. Acetylation affects nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling, while the redox state of cysteine residues influences extracellular activities (Yang2013The; Ugrinova2017HMGB1).

## Function
HMGB1, or High Mobility Group Box 1, is a multifunctional protein that plays significant roles in both intracellular and extracellular environments. Intracellularly, HMGB1 is predominantly located in the nucleus, where it acts as a cofactor in transcription regulation and supports chromatin structure by binding DNA in a nonspecific sequence manner. It is involved in DNA repair processes, including nucleotide excision repair, base excision repair, and mismatch repair pathways, which are crucial for maintaining genomic integrity (Yang2013The; Naglova2012HMGB1). HMGB1 also participates in chromatin remodeling, stabilizing nucleosomes, and mediating DNA bending, which facilitates the binding of transcription factors and steroid hormone receptors (Naglova2012HMGB1).

Extracellularly, HMGB1 functions as a proinflammatory cytokine, mediating immune responses by interacting with receptors such as RAGE and Toll-Like Receptors (TLR) 2, 4, and 9. This interaction leads to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, contributing to the activation of innate immune responses (Yang2013The; Naglova2012HMGB1). HMGB1 is also involved in tissue regeneration by attracting stem cells to sites of inflammation, promoting processes like myogenesis and angiogenesis, and accelerating wound healing (Naglova2012HMGB1). Its ability to migrate between the cytoplasm and nucleus is cell cycle-dependent, and its localization varies among different cell types (Naglova2012HMGB1).

## Clinical Significance
The HMGB1 gene is clinically significant due to its involvement in various diseases through mutations, altered expression levels, and disrupted interactions. Non-synonymous mutations in HMGB1, such as R10T and F103C, are highly deleterious and disease-causing. The R10T mutation affects the B-box domain, potentially disrupting DNA binding and protein interactions, while the F103C mutation impacts the TLR binding and cytokine-inducing region, affecting cellular signaling (Santhiya2019The).

Altered expression of HMGB1 is linked to several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. In rheumatoid arthritis, elevated HMGB1 levels are found at sites of joint inflammation, and its injection can induce arthritis (Kang2014HMGB1). In systemic lupus erythematosus, HMGB1 forms immune complexes that induce cytokine release, correlating with disease activity (Kang2014HMGB1). HMGB1 is also implicated in cancer, where its expression affects tumor growth, metastasis, and chemotherapy sensitivity. In hepatocellular carcinoma, increased HMGB1 levels correlate with disease progression and metastasis (Kang2014HMGB1; Tripathi2019HMGB1).

HMGB1's interactions with receptors like RAGE and TLRs contribute to its role in inflammation and cancer progression, making it a potential therapeutic target (Taverna2022High; Tripathi2019HMGB1).

## Interactions
HMGB1 interacts with DNA and various proteins, playing a crucial role in DNA repair, transcription, and chromatin remodeling. It binds to DNA in a non-sequence specific manner, with a preference for structured or distorted DNA, such as cruciform or bent DNA, and introduces significant bends in the DNA structure (Dintilhac2002HMGB1; Mandke2019Interactions). This binding facilitates the recognition and repair of DNA damage, including UV-induced and cisplatin-induced lesions, by cooperating with nucleotide excision repair (NER) proteins like XPA and RPA (Mandke2019Interactions).

HMGB1 also interacts with chromatin components, such as histones, and can displace histone H1 from nucleosomes, promoting chromatin remodeling and increasing DNA accessibility (Štros2010HMGB; Mandke2019Interactions). It competes with histone H1 for binding sites on nucleosomes, affecting chromatin structure and transcription factor access (Štros2010HMGB).

In addition to its interactions with nucleic acids, HMGB1 forms complexes with various proteins, including transcription factors like p53, nuclear receptors, and DNA repair proteins (Dintilhac2002HMGB1; Štros2010HMGB). These interactions often enhance the DNA binding affinity of the associated factors and can influence transcriptional regulation (Dintilhac2002HMGB1).
