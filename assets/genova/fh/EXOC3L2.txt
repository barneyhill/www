# EXOC3L2

## Overview
EXOC3L2 is a gene that encodes the protein exocyst complex component 3 like 2, which is involved in the exocyst complex, a critical component of vesicle trafficking and tethering at the plasma membrane. This protein is categorized as part of the exocyst complex, which is essential for exocytosis and the transport of proteins and lipids to the cell surface, influencing cellular processes such as growth, migration, and signaling. The EXOC3L2 gene produces two splice variants, with the longer isoform consisting of 789 amino acids and a shorter isoform of 242 amino acids. The protein is particularly significant in endothelial cells, where it is required for directional migration and may play a role in membrane-bending functions, such as the formation of tunneling nanotubes. Mutations in EXOC3L2 have been associated with a novel syndrome characterized by neurological, renal, and hematological symptoms, as well as ciliopathies like Meckel-Gruber syndrome and Dandy-Walker malformation (Shalata2018Biallelic; Watanabe2022Essential; O’Callaghan2018Modeling).

## Structure
The EXOC3L2 gene encodes a protein that is structurally related to components of the exocyst complex, which is involved in vesicle trafficking. The protein has two known splice variants: a longer isoform consisting of 789 amino acids and a shorter isoform derived from the last four exons of the long transcript, encoding a 242 amino acid protein (O’Callaghan2018Modeling). Structural homology modeling of the longer isoform was performed using the SWISS-MODEL server, with the crystal structure of TNFαIP2 (M-Sec) serving as the best template match. This modeling revealed that M-Sec shares 22% amino acid identity with the 789 amino acid isoform of EXOC3L2 (O’Callaghan2018Modeling).

The alternative splicing of EXOC3L2 results in regions missing from the isoforms, which are populated by basic amino acids in similar positions on the respective α-helices. This suggests that the alternative splicing may influence the protein's structural and functional properties (O’Callaghan2018Modeling). The study indicates that EXOC3L2, like its paralog M-Sec, may play a role in membrane-bending functions, including the formation of tunneling nanotubes, either as part of the exocyst complex or independently (O’Callaghan2018Modeling).

## Function
EXOC3L2 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the exocyst complex, which plays a critical role in vesicle trafficking and tethering at the plasma membrane. This complex is essential for exocytosis, facilitating the transport of proteins and lipids to the cell surface, thereby impacting cellular processes such as growth, migration, and signaling (O’Callaghan2018Modeling). EXOC3L2 is particularly important in the trafficking of post-Golgi vesicles to the plasma membrane, a process crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Shalata2018Biallelic).

In endothelial cells, EXOC3L2 is required for directional migration, indicating its role in cell movement and organization (O’Callaghan2018Modeling). The protein is also associated with membrane-bending functions, including the formation of tunneling nanotubes, which are involved in the transport of organelles and protein complexes between cells (O’Callaghan2018Modeling). This suggests that EXOC3L2 may have functions beyond the exocyst complex, contributing to cellular communication and structural integrity.

The gene's expression is notably high in endothelial cells during embryonic development, highlighting its importance in cardiovascular development and vascular stability (Watanabe2022Essential). However, its specific functions in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EXOC3L2 gene have been linked to a novel syndrome characterized by neurological, renal, and hematological symptoms. This syndrome includes Dandy-Walker malformation, renal failure, developmental delay, hypotonia, panhypopituitarism, hearing impairment, cataracts, congenital glaucoma, severe anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Imaging studies of affected individuals reveal brain abnormalities such as massive cerebrospinal fluid collection in the posterior fossa and dysgenetic vermis (Shalata2018Biallelic).

The EXOC3L2 gene is also associated with ciliopathies, including Meckel-Gruber syndrome and Dandy-Walker malformation. Specific mutations, such as the homozygous c.398dupC; p.Leu134Thrfs*25 variant, have been observed in patients with symptoms resembling Meckel-Gruber syndrome, including occipital encephalocele and early postnatal death (Halim2023The). Another study identified a homozygous deletion of exons 3-5 in EXOC3L2, linked to severe fetal phenotypes like cerebellar vermis hypoplasia and enlarged kidneys (Smogavec2022Singleton).

Research in mice has shown that Exoc3l2 is crucial for cardiovascular development, with knockout models resulting in embryonic lethality due to hemorrhaging, indicating its essential role in vascular stability (Watanabe2022Essential).
