# ZNF774

## Overview
ZNF774 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 774, a member of the Kruppel-family of C2H2-type zinc-finger proteins. This protein is characterized by its ability to bind DNA and is implicated in the regulation of gene expression. Zinc finger protein 774 functions as a transcriptional regulator and is involved in various cellular processes, including the modulation of thyroid hormone receptor activity and the regulation of tau expression, which is significant in neurological contexts (Hahm2013Research; Huang2024Causal). The gene is also associated with clinical conditions such as autism spectrum disorders and sickle cell disease, highlighting its potential role in neurodevelopmental and hematological disorders (AlNaama2020C2H2Type; Tsukahara2024Identification). Despite these associations, the precise mechanisms by which ZNF774 influences these conditions remain to be fully elucidated, necessitating further research to understand its biological and clinical significance.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF774 has been implicated in several clinical conditions, although its precise role in these disorders is not fully understood. Genetic studies have associated ZNF774 with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), suggesting a potential link between mutations or alterations in this gene and neurodevelopmental conditions (AlNaama2020C2H2Type). However, the specific mechanisms by which ZNF774 contributes to ASDs remain to be elucidated.

In the context of sickle cell disease (SCD), ZNF774 is located near a significant genetic locus identified in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) that is associated with acute chest syndrome (ACS), a severe complication of SCD. The lead SNP at this locus, rs79915189, is an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) for ZNF774, indicating that variations in this region may influence the expression of ZNF774 and other nearby genes, potentially affecting the clinical manifestations of SCD (Tsukahara2024Identification).

Despite these associations, some studies have found that ZNF774 variants do not segregate with certain phenotypes, such as developmental macular disorders, suggesting that not all mutations in ZNF774 are clinically significant in every context (Cipriani2017Genomewide). Further research is needed to clarify the clinical significance of ZNF774 mutations and their impact on gene regulation and disease.

## Interactions
ZNF774, a Kruppel-family zinc-finger protein, has been identified to interact with thyroid hormone receptor-β2 (TRβ2) more strongly than with TRβ1 in GST-pulldown assays. This interaction was confirmed in transfected HEK293T cells. Despite this stronger interaction, ZNF774 did not show a statistically significant greater effect on TRβ2 compared to TRβ1 in T3-driven reporter gene expression assays. It is suggested that ZNF774 may function as an isoform-independent thyroid hormone receptor coregulator, enhancing reporter gene expression by both TRβ1 and TRβ2 in a similar manner (Hahm2013Research).

ZNF774 is also implicated in the regulation of tau expression, where its knockout leads to a moderate decrease in MAPT expression, indicating a positive regulatory relationship. This suggests that ZNF774 may act as a negative regulator of MAPT expression, as its knockout results in a moderate increase in MAPT levels. Additionally, the knockout of ZNF774 leads to a significant increase in the z-score of STK39, suggesting a potential indirect interaction between these genes (Huang2024Causal).

In the context of brain tissues, ZNF774 may bind to differentially methylated regions in gene promoters, influencing gene expression relevant to brain plasticity and development (PerdomoSabogal2022DNA).
