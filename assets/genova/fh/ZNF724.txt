# ZNF724

## Overview
ZNF724 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 724, a member of the zinc finger protein family, which is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs that facilitate binding to DNA, RNA, or other proteins. These proteins often function as transcription factors, playing crucial roles in regulating gene expression. Zinc finger protein 724 is implicated in various biological processes, including cellular differentiation and proliferation. Recent studies have highlighted its involvement in the progression of certain diseases, such as cancer and gout, suggesting its potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target (Lian2020The; Kawamura2019Genomewide). Despite its emerging significance, further research is needed to fully understand the molecular mechanisms and pathways mediated by ZNF724 and its encoded protein.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF724 has been implicated in the progression of certain diseases, particularly in cancer and gout. In lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), ZNF724 is involved in the interaction with differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are associated with the facilitation of carbohydrate binding and oxidoreductase activity, potentially promoting cancer progression (Lian2020The). The expression patterns of ZNF724, along with other transcription factors, are closely linked to the TNM stages of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and LUSC, suggesting its role as a potential prognostic biomarker or therapeutic target (Lian2020The).

In the context of gout, a genome-wide association study identified ZNF724 as a novel locus associated with the progression of asymptomatic hyperuricaemia (AHUA) to gout. This suggests that ZNF724 may play a role in aggravating AHUA into gout, highlighting its potential clinical significance in understanding and managing this condition (Kawamura2019Genomewide). However, the specific mutations, expression alterations, or interaction changes of ZNF724 in these diseases are not detailed, indicating a need for further research to fully elucidate its clinical implications (Kawamura2019Genomewide).
