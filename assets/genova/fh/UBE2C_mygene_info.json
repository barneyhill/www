cellular mechanism for targeting abnormal or short-lived proteins for degradation. Ubiquitination involves at least three classes of enzymes: ubiquitin-activating enzymes, ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, and ubiquitin-protein ligases. This gene encodes a member of the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family. The encoded protein is required for the destruction of mitotic cyclins and for cell cycle progression, and may be involved in cancer progression. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. Pseudogenes of this gene have been defined on chromosomes 4, 14, 15, 18, and 19.
