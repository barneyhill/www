# CNIH3

## Overview
CNIH3 is a gene that encodes the cornichon family AMPA receptor auxiliary protein 3, a transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in the modulation of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs). These receptors are crucial for synaptic transmission and plasticity in the central nervous system. The CNIH3 protein is characterized by its four transmembrane helices and its function as an auxiliary subunit that influences the trafficking, localization, and functional properties of AMPARs within synaptic membranes (Kamalova2020AMPA; Nakagawa2019Structures). It is particularly involved in the forward trafficking of GluA1-containing AMPARs, which is essential for the expression and modulation of synaptic strength and plasticity, especially in the hippocampus (Herring2013Cornichon; Frye2021Sex). CNIH3's interactions with AMPAR subunits, such as GluA2, and its modulation of receptor kinetics underscore its importance in maintaining synaptic function and memory formation (Shelley2011Functional).

## Structure
The CNIH3 protein is a member of the cornichon family and functions as an auxiliary subunit of AMPA receptors. Its molecular structure includes four transmembrane helices (TM1 to TM4) and an extracellular amino terminal. The cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the GluA2/CNIH3 complex reveals that CNIH3's TM2 starts in the cytoplasm and forms a loop connecting to TM3, without penetrating the extracellular space (Kamalova2020AMPA; Nakagawa2019Structures). This topology was initially misinterpreted by prediction algorithms as having three transmembrane segments due to the continuous hydrophobicity of TM2 and TM3 (Kamalova2020AMPA).

CNIH3 primarily resides within the membrane, suggesting that receptor modulation occurs through intramembrane and cytoplasmic interactions rather than extracellular contact (Nakagawa2019Structures). The protein binds to the M1 and M4 helices of adjacent GluA2 subunits, similar to TARPs and GSG1L, despite lacking sequence homology (Nakagawa2019Structures). A unique cytoplasmic α-helix in CNIH3 interfaces with the M4 of GluA2, playing a role in gating modulation (Kamalova2020AMPA). The structural alignment of CNIH3 with TARP g-8 shows a resemblance in the geometry of their helical bundles (Nakagawa2019Structures).

## Function
CNIH3 (cornichon family AMPA receptor auxiliary protein 3) is a protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs), which are essential for synaptic transmission and plasticity in the brain. CNIH3 functions as an auxiliary subunit of AMPARs, influencing their trafficking, localization, and function within synaptic membranes (Kamalova2020AMPA; Nakagawa2019Structures). 

CNIH3 is involved in the forward trafficking of GluA1-containing AMPARs from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus and subsequently to the neuronal surface, which is critical for the functional expression of these receptors (Herring2013Cornichon). It selectively interacts with GluA1 subunits, allowing GluA1A2 heteromers to dominate the population of neuronal AMPARs, particularly in CA1 pyramidal neurons (Herring2013Cornichon). This interaction is important for long-term potentiation (LTP) and synaptic plasticity, as GluA1A2 heteromers display slower deactivation kinetics, enhancing dendritic signal integration (Herring2013Cornichon).

CNIH3's role in modulating AMPAR subunit composition is crucial for maintaining synaptic function and memory formation, with its effects being particularly significant in the hippocampus (Frye2021Sex). The protein's activity is influenced by endogenous factors, such as sex hormones, which can modulate synaptic plasticity and memory mechanisms (Frye2021Sex).

## Clinical Significance
CNIH3 has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role as an auxiliary protein for AMPA receptors, which are critical for synaptic transmission in the brain. Alterations in CNIH3 expression or methylation patterns have been associated with opioid use disorder (OUD). Studies have shown that CNIH3 is differentially methylated in individuals with OUD, suggesting its involvement in the pathophysiology of opioid dependence (Nagamatsu2023CpH).

In the context of premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), CNIH3 has been identified as a differentially expressed gene. Although its direct link to POI is not well-established, disruptions in CNIH3 signaling pathways may affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, potentially leading to metabolic or oxidative stress, which are factors in the decline of oocyte quality and the onset of POI (Wu2024Transcriptomic).

CNIH3 is also upregulated in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines, indicating a potential role in chemotherapy resistance. However, its expression did not show a significant association with patient prognosis and survival in this context (Zhu2024Comprehensive).

## Interactions
CNIH3, a member of the cornichon protein family, interacts with AMPA receptor subunits, particularly GluA2, as an auxiliary subunit. It binds to the M1 and M4 helices of adjacent GluA2 subunits, similar to the interactions seen with TARPs and GSG1L, despite lacking sequence homology with these proteins. The four-helix bundle of CNIH3 can be superimposed with TARP g-8 and GluA2 helices, indicating a conserved geometric arrangement, although the specific residue contacts differ (Nakagawa2019Structures).

CNIH3 is involved in the modulation of AMPA receptor channel properties, such as increasing the weighted mean single-channel conductance and burst duration of GluA1 AMPARs. It also slows the rate of desensitization upon glutamate application, suggesting a role in modulating receptor kinetics and trafficking (Shelley2011Functional).

CNIH3 does not have an extracellular domain and consists of four membrane-spanning helices, interacting primarily within the membrane and cytoplasmic regions of AMPA receptors. This interaction is distinct from the extracellular interactions observed with other auxiliary subunits like TARPs and GSG1L (Nakagawa2019Structures).
