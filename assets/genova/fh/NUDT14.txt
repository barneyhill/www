# NUDT14

## Overview
NUDT14 is a gene that encodes the protein nudix hydrolase 14, a member of the NUDIX hydrolase family. This family of enzymes is characterized by their ability to hydrolyze nucleoside diphosphate derivatives, playing a crucial role in cellular metabolism and homeostasis. Nudix hydrolase 14 functions primarily as a UDP-glucose pyrophosphatase, catalyzing the conversion of UDP-glucose into glucose-1-phosphate and UMP, which is essential for glycogen metabolism and energy storage (Heyen2009Characterization). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and requires Mg2+ for its enzymatic activity, with optimal function at an alkaline pH (CarrerasPuigvert2017A). NUDT14 is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, skeletal muscle, and kidney, and has been implicated in several pathological conditions, such as cancer and viral infections, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (WANG2016Human; CarrerasPuigvert2017A).

## Structure
NUDT14, a member of the NUDIX hydrolase family, is characterized by its structural and functional properties. The primary structure of NUDT14 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain, which includes the conserved NUDIX box motif essential for its enzymatic activity (CarrerasPuigvert2017A). This motif is crucial for the hydrolysis of nucleoside diphosphate derivatives.

The secondary structure of NUDT14 likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of proteins in the NUDIX family, although specific details are not provided in the available context. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is important for its function and interaction with substrates. NUDT14 shares a high degree of structural similarity with NUDT5, as indicated by structural analysis and superposition studies (CarrerasPuigvert2017A).

In terms of quaternary structure, NUDT14 functions as a homodimer, similar to other NUDIX enzymes like NUDT5, which suggests potential redundancy and overlapping biochemical functions (CarrerasPuigvert2017A). The protein's activity is influenced by its structural configuration, which allows it to hydrolyze substrates such as ADP-ribose and ADP-glucose (Heyen2009Characterization). The presence of multiple isoforms or post-translational modifications has been suggested, but further investigation is needed to confirm these aspects (Heyen2009Characterization).

## Function
NUDT14 encodes a member of the NUDIX hydrolase family, which is involved in the hydrolysis of nucleoside diphosphate derivatives. The enzyme primarily functions as a UDP-glucose pyrophosphatase, catalyzing the hydrolysis of UDP-glucose to produce glucose-1-phosphate and UMP. This activity is crucial for regulating the flux of glucose into glycogen, thereby playing a significant role in cellular energy storage and metabolism (Heyen2009Characterization). NUDT14 also exhibits enzymatic activity towards ADP-ribose and ADP-glucose, with a higher catalytic efficiency for ADP-ribose, suggesting a broader substrate range than initially thought (CarrerasPuigvert2017A).

The enzyme requires Mg2+ for its activity and functions optimally at an alkaline pH. It is active in the cytoplasm and is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, skeletal muscle, and kidney, which are key sites for glycogen metabolism (CarrerasPuigvert2017A; Heyen2009Characterization). NUDT14's activity in cleaving NADH and its involvement in ADP-ribose metabolism indicate its role in maintaining nucleotide homeostasis and cellular energy balance (Kulikova2020Role). The enzyme's function in healthy human cells is linked to its ability to prevent the accumulation of potentially harmful metabolites, thus contributing to cellular metabolism and homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
NUDT14 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through its altered expression and interactions. In cancer, NUDT14 is highly expressed in certain tissues, such as adrenal, endometrium, and lung-related cancers, suggesting a potential role in tumorigenesis (CarrerasPuigvert2017A). It is also upregulated in rectal carcinoma, with overexpression observed in 75% of cases studied, indicating a possible involvement in colorectal carcinogenesis (Choi2011Analysis).

NUDT14's interaction with the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) RL13 protein affects viral DNA replication. While overexpression of NUDT14 does not significantly impact viral replication, its underexpression leads to an increase in viral DNA copies, suggesting a role in inhibiting HCMV replication (WANG2016Human). This interaction highlights NUDT14 as a potential target for therapeutic interventions in HCMV-related diseases.

Additionally, NUDT14 has been identified as a candidate gene related to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease and ischemic stroke, although these associations require further validation (Lang2019Identification). These findings underscore the importance of NUDT14 in various pathological contexts, warranting further research into its clinical significance.
