# TPRG1

## Overview
TPRG1, or tumor protein p63 regulated 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, including those related to cancer development and progression. The protein encoded by TPRG1 is categorized as a regulatory protein, which is influenced by the tumor protein p63, a member of the p53 family of transcription factors. This regulatory protein plays a significant role in modulating gene expression and cellular responses to stress and damage. TPRG1 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several cancers, including B-cell lymphomas and non-small cell lung cancer, where its expression levels and genetic variations can influence disease outcomes and serve as potential biomarkers for prognosis (Alsufyani2024Evidence; Cornish2019Identification; Wang2021Immune).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the TPRG1 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In B-cell lymphomas, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL), recurrent noncoding mutations in cis-regulatory elements (CREs) interacting with the TPRG1 promoter have been identified. These mutations are associated with increased expression of TPRG1, suggesting a role in lymphoma growth and cell cycle progression (Cornish2019Identification). 

In lung cancer, specifically stage IA-B non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), TPRG1 is part of a five-gene signature used to predict early recurrence. Its downregulation in recurrent cases indicates its potential as a prognostic marker for recurrence and survival (Wang2021Immune).

Additionally, a study has shown that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in TPRG1, rs16864017, may be influenced by zoonotic pathogens, suggesting a possible link between zoonotic diseases and certain cancers (Alsufyani2024Evidence).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of TPRG1 in cancer development and progression, underscoring its potential as a target for therapeutic strategies and as a biomarker for prognosis in various cancers.
