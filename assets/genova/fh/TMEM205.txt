# TMEM205

## Overview
TMEM205 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 205, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including viral entry and drug resistance mechanisms. TMEM205 interacts with viral glycoproteins, facilitating the entry of oncolytic herpes simplex virus into host cells, and plays a role in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Saini2022Targeting). Additionally, TMEM205 is implicated in the exosomal pathway, where it interacts with Rab11, influencing exosome trafficking and contributing to chemoresistance in certain cancers, such as ovarian clear cell carcinoma (Saini2022Targeting). The gene's expression levels have clinical significance, particularly in cancer, where it is associated with drug resistance and tumor progression, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Fu2024TMEM205; Rao2020TMEM205).

## Clinical Significance
TMEM205 is implicated in various cancers, particularly in mediating drug resistance. In gastric cancer, TMEM205 is overexpressed in cisplatin-resistant cells, contributing to enhanced proliferation, stemness, and resistance to chemotherapy. This overexpression is associated with the upregulation of drug resistance markers MDR1 and MRP1, and the promotion of tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) polarization, which is linked to poor prognosis and metastasis (Fu2024TMEM205). Knockdown of TMEM205 in combination with cisplatin treatment has been shown to reduce these effects, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Fu2024TMEM205).

In ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC), TMEM205 is involved in chemoresistance through the exosomal pathway, where it facilitates the expulsion of cisplatin from cells. Silencing TMEM205 increases intracellular cisplatin accumulation, enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy. The combination of oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV) and cisplatin has been explored as a strategy to target TMEM205, showing promise in reducing tumor growth and overcoming drug resistance (Saini2022Targeting).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, low TMEM205 expression is associated with poor survival outcomes and reduced immune cell infiltration, indicating its potential role in modulating the tumor microenvironment and influencing patient prognosis (Rao2020TMEM205).

## Interactions
TMEM205 is known to interact with glycoprotein C (gC) of the oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV), facilitating viral binding and entry into host cells. This interaction has been confirmed through immunoprecipitation and Western blot techniques, highlighting TMEM205's role in the viral entry process (Saini2022Targeting). The interaction between TMEM205 and gC also leads to the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of TMEM205 via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which is a mechanism exploited by oHSV to enhance its entry into cells (Saini2022Targeting).

TMEM205 is also involved in the exosomal pathway, where it interacts with Rab11, a protein associated with recycling endosomes. This interaction suggests a role for TMEM205 in exosome trafficking, which is linked to its function in mediating chemoresistance in ovarian clear cell carcinoma (Saini2022Targeting). The presence of TMEM205 in exosomes is associated with increased exosome release, which may contribute to drug resistance by expelling chemotherapeutic agents like cisplatin from the cell (Saini2022Targeting). These interactions highlight TMEM205's involvement in cellular processes related to drug resistance and viral entry.
