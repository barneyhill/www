# C16orf87

## Overview
C16orf87 is a gene located on chromosome 16 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 16 open reading frame 87. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, primarily through its interactions with other proteins, such as histone deacetylases and histones, which suggest a role in chromatin modification and epigenetic regulation (Joshi2013The; Ershov2023Uncharacterized). The protein is characterized by its potential involvement in post-translational modification processes, as it interacts with histone acetyltransferase KAT5 and shares similarities with zinc-finger domain-containing proteins, indicating possible DNA binding activity (Joshi2013The). C16orf87 has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, where its expression correlates with poor prognosis, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for cancer progression (Yadav2024Exosomal). The gene's interactions and regulatory roles underscore its significance in cellular signaling pathways and its potential impact on malignant transformation (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

## Clinical Significance
C16orf87 has been implicated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), where its expression levels are significantly elevated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. High expression of C16orf87 is associated with poor survival outcomes in HNSCC patients, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for poor prognosis in this type of cancer (Yadav2024Exosomal). 

The gene is also involved in cell cycle regulation and epigenetic modulation, processes that are critical in cancer biology. C16orf87 interacts with histone acetyltransferase KAT5 and histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2, indicating a role in post-translational modification and chromatin modulation (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). These interactions suggest that C16orf87 may influence cancer progression through its involvement in these pathways.

Additionally, C16orf87 has been identified in the context of protein-protein interactions that are cancer-dependent, such as its interaction with ANAPC10 in thymoma, which may be relevant for cancer prognosis and treatment (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). The gene's involvement in these interactions highlights its potential significance in cancer-related signaling pathways and its possible role in malignant transformation (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

## Interactions
C16orf87 is involved in several protein interactions, particularly with histone deacetylases and histones, suggesting a role in chromatin modification. It interacts with HDAC1 and HDAC2, which are key players in epigenetic regulation through histone deacetylation, and is associated with 16 different histones, indicating its involvement in chromatin modulation (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). C16orf87 is also identified as a stable interaction partner of HDAC1, with evidence supporting a direct interaction between these proteins (Joshi2013The). This interaction may facilitate the targeting of HDAC1 to chromatin, potentially through DNA binding activity, as C16orf87 shares similarity with a zinc-finger domain-containing protein (Joshi2013The).

Additionally, C16orf87 may interact with C1orf131, with histone acetyltransferase KAT5 as a common partner, suggesting a role in post-translational modification processes (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). The protein is also implicated in a potential binary interaction with ANAPC10 in thymoma, indicating a tissue-specific interaction (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). These interactions highlight C16orf87's potential involvement in regulatory networks and signaling pathways critical for cellular processes.
