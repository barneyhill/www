# MED23

## Overview
MED23 is a gene that encodes the protein mediator complex subunit 23, a critical component of the human Mediator complex, which is involved in the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. The MED23 protein is categorized as a transcriptional coactivator and is part of the Tail module of the Mediator complex. It plays a pivotal role in various biological processes, including cell differentiation, metabolism, and antiviral responses. MED23 interacts with several transcription factors, such as ELK1, RUNX2, and IRF7, to modulate gene expression and facilitate transcriptional regulation. Clinically, mutations in the MED23 gene have been associated with intellectual disabilities, developmental disorders, and certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal physiological functions and disease states (Monté2018Crystal; Hashemi‐Gorji2019Novel; Liu2016Mediator).

## Structure
The MED23 protein is a subunit of the human Mediator complex, specifically part of the Tail module. Its structure was determined at a resolution of 2.8 Å, revealing a complex architecture composed of 25 HEAT repeat-like motifs organized into five α-solenoids, forming an arch-shaped conformation (Monté2018Crystal). The protein is fully folded except for the last 30 amino acids and measures approximately 145 × 55 × 50 Å (Monté2018Crystal). The N-terminal domain, known as N-HEAT, consists of residues 1-220 and forms a solenoid of five HR motifs, interacting with the core region of MED23 (Monté2018Crystal). The core region, spanning residues 221-1334, adopts a compact triangular form and includes four solenoid domains: 3-HEAT, 5-HEAT, 6-HEAT, and C-HEAT (Monté2018Crystal).

MED23 features an aromatic cluster involving residues such as H613, H614, H911, W912, F1094, and Y278, surrounding a conserved motif crucial for its function in transcription regulation (Monté2018Crystal). The protein interacts with various transcription factors and regulatory proteins, including ELK1, ESX, and RUNX2, and is involved in transcription initiation, splicing, and histone modification (Monté2018Crystal). The presence of buried charges suggests potential structural changes upon effector binding (Monté2018Crystal).

## Function
MED23 is a subunit of the Mediator complex, which plays a crucial role in transcription regulation by RNA polymerase II. It acts as a bridge between gene-specific regulatory proteins and the transcription machinery, facilitating the transcription of specific genes. In healthy human cells, MED23 is involved in the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into smooth muscle cells (SMCs) or adipocytes. It functions as a molecular switch between the Ras and RhoA pathways, promoting SMC differentiation while repressing adipocyte differentiation by regulating the binding of transcription factors to gene promoters (Yin2012Mediator).

MED23 is also linked to insulin signaling within the adipogenesis transcription cascade. It interacts with the transcription factor ELK1, which is enhanced by insulin-induced MAPK activation, leading to the induction of Krox20, a key transcription factor in adipogenesis (Wang2009Mediator). This interaction is essential for the recruitment of the Mediator Complex and RNA Polymerase II to the Krox20 promoter, facilitating transcription and adipocyte differentiation (Wang2009Mediator).

In the context of metabolism, MED23 regulates glucose and lipid metabolism, particularly in the liver, by influencing the expression of gluconeogenic genes through FoxO1 (Youn2016Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MED23 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. MED23 mutations have been linked to intellectual disabilities and developmental disorders, characterized by symptoms such as developmental delay, microcephaly, hypotonia, severe intellectual disability, speech delay, and spasticity (Hashemi‐Gorji2019Novel; Salzano2023Case). These mutations can lead to the deregulation of genes crucial for early brain development, resulting in neurological symptoms like seizures and epilepsy (Lionel2016MED23‐associated; Alyazidi2024MED23).

In the context of cancer, MED23 is implicated in Ras-active lung cancer. It is overexpressed in lung cancer cells with hyperactive Ras signaling, and its expression level correlates with the strength of Ras-MAPK signaling. This overexpression is associated with increased tumorigenicity and poor prognosis in patients with Ras-active lung cancer (Yang2012Selective). Targeting MED23 could potentially inhibit the growth of cancer cells with EGFR or B-raf mutations, making it a candidate for therapeutic strategies in Ras-driven cancers (Yang2012Selective).

MED23 mutations are also associated with refractory epilepsy, which can be responsive to a ketogenic diet. This suggests a link between MED23-related energy homeostasis and seizure control (Lionel2016MED23‐associated). These findings highlight the clinical significance of MED23 in both neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer.

## Interactions
MED23, a subunit of the human Mediator complex, engages in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in transcription regulation. It interacts with the transcription factor ELK1, which is activated by MAPK signaling, playing a significant role in transcription regulation and is implicated in Ras-active lung cancer (Monté2018Crystal). MED23 also interacts with other transcription factors such as ESX, RUNX2, and IRF7, influencing transcriptional activity and gene expression (Monté2018Crystal).

In the context of osteoblast differentiation and bone development, MED23 acts as a coactivator for RUNX2. It modulates RUNX2's transcriptional activity without altering its expression levels, facilitating the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to RUNX2 target gene promoters (Liu2016Mediator). This interaction is crucial for proper bone development and osteoblast differentiation (Liu2016Mediator).

MED23 also plays a role in antiviral responses, particularly against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). It interacts with IRF7 to enhance the expression of type III interferons (IFN-λ), contributing to its antiviral effects (Griffiths2013A). These interactions highlight MED23's multifaceted role in transcription regulation and its involvement in various biological processes and pathologies.
