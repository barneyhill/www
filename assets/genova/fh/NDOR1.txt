# NDOR1

## Overview
NDOR1, or NADPH dependent diflavin oxidoreductase 1, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which functions as a diflavin oxidoreductase enzyme. This enzyme is integral to electron transfer processes within human cells, particularly in the cytosolic iron-sulfur assembly (CIA) machinery. The protein encoded by NDOR1 is involved in the maturation of cytosolic and nuclear iron-sulfur (Fe-S) proteins, forming a stable complex with anamorsin to facilitate electron transfer from NADPH to the FMN moiety and subsequently to the [2Fe-2S] cluster bound to anamorsin. This process is crucial for the assembly of [4Fe-4S] clusters, which are essential for various cellular functions (CiofiBaffoni2022The; CiofiBaffoni2018Protein). Additionally, NDOR1 interacts with the mitochondrial protein mitoNEET, playing a role in cellular iron homeostasis and genome stability, and is involved in the activation of bioreductive prodrugs under hypoxic conditions (CiofiBaffoni2022The; Querci2024Structural; Guise2011Diflavin).

## Function
NDOR1 (NADPH dependent diflavin oxidoreductase 1) is a crucial enzyme involved in electron transfer processes within human cells. It plays a significant role in the cytosolic iron-sulfur assembly (CIA) machinery, which is essential for the maturation of cytosolic and nuclear iron-sulfur (Fe-S) proteins. NDOR1 forms a stable complex with anamorsin, facilitating the transfer of electrons from NADPH to the FMN moiety, and subsequently to the [2Fe-2S] cluster bound to anamorsin. This electron transfer is vital for the reductive coupling of two [2Fe-2S] clusters into a [4Fe-4S] cluster, which is then inserted into target proteins (CiofiBaffoni2022The; CiofiBaffoni2018Protein).

The NDOR1-anamorsin complex also interacts with the mitochondrial protein mitoNEET, reducing its oxidized [2Fe-2S] clusters, which is important for the repair of cytosolic iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1) under oxidative stress conditions (Camponeschi2017AnamorsinNdor1; CiofiBaffoni2022The). NDOR1's activity is modulated by the cellular redox state, playing a role in maintaining cellular iron homeostasis and genome stability (Querci2024Structural). Additionally, NDOR1 is involved in the activation of bioreductive prodrugs under hypoxic conditions, highlighting its role in cellular redox balance and detoxification processes (Guise2011Diflavin).

## Interactions
NDOR1, a NADPH-dependent diflavin oxidoreductase, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for electron transfer processes. It forms a stable complex with anamorsin, a member of the CIAPIN1 protein family, which is essential for the assembly of [4Fe-4S] clusters. This interaction involves the transfer of electrons from the FMN moiety of NDOR1 to the redox-active Fe/S cluster of anamorsin, facilitated by specific protein-protein interactions (CiofiBaffoni2022The; CiofiBaffoni2018Protein).

The NDOR1-anamorsin complex also interacts with the mitochondrial [2Fe-2S] protein mitoNEET. This transient interaction allows the complex to convert oxidized [2Fe-2S] clusters of mitoNEET into their reduced form, playing a role in cytosolic Fe/S cluster repair and reactivating cytosolic apo-IRP1 into Fe/S loaded, active aconitase under oxidative stress conditions (Camponeschi2017AnamorsinNdor1; CiofiBaffoni2022The).

NDOR1's interaction with anamorsin is crucial for the electron transfer chain that assembles cytosolic Fe/S proteins. The FMN-binding domain of NDOR1 directly interacts with anamorsin, transferring electrons to it, which is essential for the reductive coupling of [2Fe-2S] clusters into [4Fe-4S] clusters (Banci2013Human; CiofiBaffoni2018Protein).
