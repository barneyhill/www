# POU5F1

## Overview
POU5F1, also known as OCT4, is a gene that encodes the POU class 5 homeobox 1 protein, a pivotal transcription factor involved in the regulation of pluripotency and self-renewal in embryonic stem cells. This protein is categorized as a transcription factor due to its role in binding to specific DNA sequences to regulate gene expression. POU5F1 is essential for maintaining the undifferentiated state of stem cells by forming complexes with other transcription factors, such as SOX2 and NANOG, to co-occupy target genes (Boyer2005Core). The gene is known to produce multiple isoforms, each with distinct expression patterns and potential biological functions, contributing to its complex role in cellular differentiation and development (Cauffman2006POU5F1). The protein's activity is primarily nuclear, where it influences the transcriptional regulatory circuitry necessary for stem cell maintenance and differentiation (Wang2010Concise).

## Structure


## Function
The POU5F1 gene, also known as OCT4, is a critical transcription factor involved in maintaining pluripotency and self-renewal in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). It plays a key role in the transcriptional regulatory circuitry by co-occupying target genes with other transcription factors such as SOX2 and NANOG, which are essential for the undifferentiated state of stem cells (Boyer2005Core). OCT4 regulates gene expression by binding to DNA sequences, influencing cell differentiation and development. It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it forms complexes with other proteins to control the transcription of genes necessary for stem cell self-renewal and differentiation (Wang2010Concise).

The gene produces multiple isoforms, including POU5F1_iA and POU5F1_iB, which have distinct expression patterns and potentially different biological functions. POU5F1_iA is associated with the undifferentiated phenotype and is expressed in the nuclei of hESCs and blastocysts, while POU5F1_iB is primarily cytoplasmic, and its function remains unclear (Cauffman2006POU5F1). The expression of POU5F1_iA is crucial for maintaining totipotency, although its presence alone does not guarantee a totipotent state (Cauffman2006POU5F1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the POU5F1 gene, also known as OCT4, have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In gastric cancer, POU5F1 is significantly upregulated, correlating with poor prognosis. It promotes the proliferation, migration, and invasion of gastric cancer cells by reducing the ubiquitination level of TRAF6, which activates the NF-κB signaling pathway (Yang2023POU5F1). In colorectal cancer, the POU5F1B retrogene, a paralog of POU5F1, is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis. It enhances cancer cell growth and metastasis, acting as a negative prognostic marker (SimóRiudalbas2022Transposonactivated).

In psoriasis vulgaris, genetic polymorphisms in POU5F1 are associated with increased susceptibility, particularly in early-onset cases. Specific alleles, such as +1377T, are linked to a higher risk of developing the condition (Chang2007The).

The expression of POU5F1 and its pseudogenes, such as POU5F1P4, varies across different cancer types, influencing clinical outcomes. For instance, high expression of POU5F1P4 is associated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer, while low expression correlates with poor outcomes in breast and gastric cancers (Saha2018Systematic).

## Interactions
POU5F1, also known as OCT4, is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in maintaining pluripotency in embryonic stem cells. It interacts with other transcription factors, such as SOX2, to form a complex that binds to DNA enhancer regions, regulating gene expression essential for cell-fate determination. The interaction between POU5F1 and SOX2 is particularly important for the regulation of genes like FGF4 and UTF1, with their dimerization on DNA being influenced by the specific enhancer regions (Reményi2003Crystal).

In mouse embryonic stem cells, POU5F1 and SOX2 form a ternary complex with DNA, which is more stable than their individual binary complexes. This cooperative interaction is crucial for the transcriptional regulation of the POU5F1 gene itself, highlighting the importance of the Oct4/Sox2 complex in maintaining the transcriptional activity of POU5F1 in stem cells (Chew2005Reciprocal).

POU5F1 also participates in complex multimeric configurations with DNA, often binding as a dimer to noncanonical binding sites. These interactions may influence the recruitment of transcriptional coactivators, such as POU2AF1/OCA-B, and play a role in gene regulation (Tantin2008Highthroughput).
