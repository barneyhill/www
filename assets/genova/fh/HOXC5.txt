# HOXC5

## Overview
HOXC5 is a gene that encodes the homeobox C5 protein, a transcription factor belonging to the homeobox gene family. This family is characterized by the presence of a homeodomain, which facilitates DNA binding and plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression during embryonic development and cellular differentiation. The homeobox C5 protein is particularly involved in the repression of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene, thereby influencing telomere maintenance and cellular aging processes. Through its interactions with other transcription factors and histone deacetylases, homeobox C5 modulates chromatin structure and gene expression, contributing to its role in developmental pathways and cancer suppression (Yan2018HoxC5). The gene's evolutionary conservation across species underscores its significance in fundamental biological processes (Yan2018HoxC5).

## Function
HOXC5 is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in regulating gene expression during cellular differentiation and development. In healthy human cells, HOXC5 is involved in the repression of hTERT, the catalytic subunit of telomerase, which is crucial for telomere maintenance. This repression is important for promoting replicative aging and acts as a barrier to tumorigenesis by limiting cell proliferation (Yan2018HoxC5). HOXC5 achieves this by binding to an upstream enhancer region of hTERT, disrupting its interaction with the promoter, and thereby silencing hTERT expression. This mechanism is part of a regulatory loop involving miR-615-3p, which is located within an intron of the HOXC5 gene (Yan2018HoxC5).

HOXC5 is also involved in the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into neural progenitor cells, indicating its role in developmental processes (Yan2018HoxC5). The protein interacts with other transcription factors, such as Pbx4 and Meis3, to form complexes that recruit histone deacetylases, further repressing hTERT expression (Yan2018HoxC5). This function is conserved in long-lived primates, highlighting its evolutionary significance (Yan2018HoxC5).

## Clinical Significance
The HOXC5 gene has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in regulating hTERT expression, a key component of telomerase activity. Alterations in HOXC5 expression can lead to the activation of hTERT, contributing to tumorigenesis. Specifically, reduced expression of HOXC5 is associated with the activation of hTERT in cancers such as thymoma and testicular germ cell tumors, where there is a strong inverse correlation between HOXC5 and hTERT expression (Yan2018HoxC5). This deregulation may provide an alternative mechanism for hTERT activation in cancers, particularly those derived from tissues with telomerase-positive progenitor cells or stem cells (Yan2018HoxC5).

HOXC5 also interacts with miR-615-3p to repress hTERT, and its overexpression has been shown to significantly reduce hTERT mRNA levels and inhibit cancer cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo (Yan2018HoxC5). The gene's role in cancer suppression is further supported by its involvement in forming complexes with Pbx4 and Meis3 proteins, which recruit histone deacetylase proteins to repress hTERT expression, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation in cancer cells (Brotto2020Contributions). These findings suggest that HOXC5 plays a critical role in maintaining telomere homeostasis and preventing cancer development when its expression is altered.

## Interactions
HOXC5 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in gene regulation and cellular processes. It specifically interacts with Pbx4 and Meis3 proteins, forming complexes that are crucial for the repression of hTERT expression. These interactions are demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, showing that HOXC5, when overexpressed with Pbx4 or Meis3, synergistically reduces hTERT mRNA levels in HeLa cells. HOXC5 also forms a complex with Pbx4 to recruit Class I HDACs, such as HDAC1 and HDAC3, to repress hTERT expression by binding to an upstream enhancer region of hTERT (Yan2018HoxC5).

HOXC5 is involved in the canonical WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway, interacting with USP11 in human spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). This interaction is crucial for regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis. The interaction between USP11 and HOXC5 was confirmed through double immunofluorescence, co-immunoprecipitation, and molecular docking assays, which demonstrated their co-localization in cell nuclei and cytoplasm and stable binding interactions at the molecular level (Gao2024USP11).

HOXC5 also participates in protein-protein interactions with other members of the HOX gene family, such as HOXD8, through its homeo domain, as shown by affinity-chromatography experiments (Zappavigna1994Specificity).
