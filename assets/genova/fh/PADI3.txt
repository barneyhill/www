# PADI3

## Overview
The PADI3 gene encodes the enzyme peptidyl arginine deiminase type III, which is a member of the peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) family of enzymes. These enzymes are responsible for the post-translational modification of proteins through citrullination, a process that converts arginine residues into citrulline, thereby altering protein structure and function. PADI3 is predominantly expressed in the epidermis and hair follicles, where it plays a critical role in the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes and the structural integrity of hair. The enzyme is characterized by a complex molecular structure, including a C-terminal catalytic domain and an N-terminal domain with immunoglobulin-like subdomains, and requires calcium ions for its activity (Alghamdi2019An; Funabashi2021Structures). Mutations in the PADI3 gene have been linked to hair disorders such as uncombable hair syndrome and central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia, highlighting its clinical significance in dermatological conditions (McGrath2019PADI3; Malki2019Variant).

## Structure
The human peptidylarginine deiminase type III (PADI3) enzyme is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes distinct domains essential for its function. PADI3 consists of two main domains: a C-terminal catalytic domain and an N-terminal domain, which is further divided into two immunoglobulin-like subdomains (IgG1 and IgG2) (Funabashi2021Structures). The enzyme's active site is formed upon binding with calcium ions, which induces a conformational change necessary for its catalytic activity (Alghamdi2019An; Funabashi2021Structures).

PADI3 forms a homodimer, a quaternary structure shared with other PAD isozymes like PAD2 and PAD4, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity and structural stability (Alghamdi2019An; Funabashi2021Structures). The enzyme has five calcium-binding sites that are critical for positioning the active site residues and facilitating substrate interaction (Alghamdi2019An).

The active site cavity of PADI3 is more hydrophobic compared to PAD4, influenced by specific amino acid residues such as Gly374 and Leu640, which affect inhibitor binding and hydrogen-bonding patterns (Funabashi2021Structures). The catalytic residue Cys646 is conserved among PAD1-PAD4, highlighting its importance in the enzyme's catalytic mechanism (Funabashi2021Structures).

## Function
The PADI3 gene encodes the enzyme peptidyl arginine deiminase type III, which plays a crucial role in the post-translational modification of proteins through a process known as citrullination or deimination. This process involves the conversion of arginine residues into citrulline, altering the charge and potentially the structure and function of the proteins involved (Kanno2000Human; Dong2006NFY). PADI3 is primarily active in the epidermis and hair follicles, where it is involved in the terminal processing of structural proteins such as filaggrin, trichohyalin, and keratin. These proteins are essential for maintaining the structure and function of skin and hair (Kanno2000Human; Dong2006NFY).

In hair follicles, PADI3 is localized in the inner and outer root sheaths and is thought to modulate hair structural proteins during hair and hair follicle formation (Kanno2000Human). In the epidermis, PADI3 contributes to the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, which is important for maintaining epidermal homeostasis (Dong2006NFY). The enzyme's activity is regulated by transcription factors such as NF-Y and Sp1, which bind to its promoter region, ensuring proper expression in keratinocytes and hair follicles (Dong2006NFY).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PADI3 gene are associated with several hair disorders, most notably uncombable hair syndrome (UHS) and central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia (CCCA). UHS is characterized by dry, frizzy hair that is difficult to manage and is often linked to mutations in PADI3, TGM3, and TCHH, which are involved in hair shaft formation. Specific mutations in PADI3, such as c.881C>T (p.Ala294Val), c.335T>A (p.Leu112His), and c.1813C>A (p.Pro605Thr), have been identified in individuals with UHS, leading to structural changes in the enzyme that affect its function (Ü.2016Mutations pages 0-6). These mutations result in reduced enzymatic activity and abnormal protein aggregation, contributing to the hair's unique structural properties (Ü.2016Mutations pages 4-5).

PADI3 mutations have also been implicated in CCCA, a form of scarring alopecia predominantly affecting women of African descent. Mutations such as p.Thr286Ala, p.Arg557Trp, and p.Ala582Thr have been identified in CCCA patients, leading to protein misfolding and reduced expression (Malki2019Variant). These genetic alterations disrupt normal hair follicle development and are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of CCCA (McGrath2019PADI3). The genetic association of PADI3 with CCCA suggests an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern (Malki2019Variant).

## Interactions
PADI3 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in various biological processes. In human keratinocytes, PADI3 transcription is regulated by the transcription factors NF-Y, Sp1, and Sp3. These factors bind to specific cis-acting elements such as CCAAT and GC boxes in the PADI3 promoter region, which are crucial for its transcription. The binding of NF-Y to CCAAT boxes and Sp1/Sp3 to GC boxes has been demonstrated through electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and confirmed by supershift assays with specific antibodies (Dong2006NFY).

PADI3 also interacts with structural proteins in the skin and hair follicles. It is involved in the deimination of trichohyalin and filaggrin, which are important for hair and skin structure. In hair follicles, PADI3 is localized in the inner and outer root sheaths and is associated with trichohyalin, facilitating its solubilization and cross-linking by transglutaminases (Kanno2000Human). Additionally, PADI3 colocalizes with the Ca2+-binding protein S100A3 in the mature cuticle, promoting the assembly of S100A3 into homotetramers, which enhances its Ca2+-binding properties (Moelants2012Peptidylarginine). These interactions highlight PADI3's role in modulating protein function and stability through citrullination.
