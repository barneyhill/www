# ANKRD13D

## Overview
ANKRD13D is a gene that encodes the ankyrin repeat domain 13D protein, which is a member of the ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein family. This protein is characterized by its involvement in cellular processes through protein-protein interactions, particularly in the regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway. ANKRD13D contains ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) that facilitate the binding of ubiquitinated proteins, playing a crucial role in the endocytosis and trafficking of EGFR. The protein acts as a molecular scaffold, promoting the formation of complexes between activated EGFR and E3 ligases, thereby influencing the ubiquitination status of proteins involved in EGFR signaling (Mattioni2020Ring). ANKRD13D is active in perinuclear structures, likely involved in endosomal trafficking or protein recycling processes (Mattioni2020Ring). Its interactions with other proteins, such as valosin-containing protein (VCP) and RING finger protein 11 (RNF11), underscore its role in cellular signaling pathways and its potential implications in diseases like Alzheimer's and cancer (Chen2021Network; Burana2016The; Zhan2021Rare).

## Function
ANKRD13D is a member of the ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein family, which plays a significant role in cellular processes through protein-protein interactions. In healthy human cells, ANKRD13D is involved in the regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway. It contains ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) that are crucial for binding ubiquitinated proteins, facilitating the rapid internalization of activated EGFR from the cell surface and its sorting in the endosome-to-lysosome route. This function is essential during the early phases of EGFR endocytosis (Mattioni2020Ring).

ANKRD13D interacts with RING finger protein 11 (RNF11), a RING E3 ligase, forming a complex that is modulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulus. This interaction suggests that ANKRD13D acts as a molecular scaffold, promoting the formation of a complex between activated EGFR and E3 ligases, thereby regulating the ubiquitination status of proteins involved in EGFR signaling (Mattioni2020Ring). The protein is active in perinuclear punctuate structures, likely recycling and late endosome vesicles, indicating a role in endosomal trafficking or protein recycling processes (Mattioni2020Ring).

## Clinical Significance
ANKRD13D has been implicated in several diseases, most notably Alzheimer's disease (AD). Alterations in the expression of ANKRD13D have been observed in AD patients, with decreased expression levels correlating with advanced Braak stages, which measure AD progression (Zhan2021Rare). The gene is involved in the endocytic pathway, regulating the internalization of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a process crucial for preventing amyloid-beta-induced angiogenesis deficits in brain endothelial cells. Overexpression of ANKRD13 proteins can inhibit EGFR internalization, potentially affecting AD pathology (Zhan2021Rare). Rare deleterious single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in ANKRD13D have been identified, with some predicted to be missense damaging variants, possibly altering the gene's ubiquitin-binding ability and impacting AD development (Zhan2021Rare).

In cancer, ANKRD13D is part of a network of genes differentially expressed in colon adenocarcinoma, suggesting its involvement in tumor progression and patient prognosis (Chen2021Network). The gene's interaction with EGFR is significant in cancer, as EGFR signaling is often implicated in tumor growth (Chen2021Network). ANKRD13D has also been used in a panel of DNA methylation markers to identify colorectal cancer in cell-free DNA samples (Chen2021Networka).

## Interactions
ANKRD13D is involved in several protein interactions that play a role in cellular processes. It interacts with valosin-containing protein (VCP/p97) and ubiquitin (Ub) protein conjugates on late endosomes. This interaction is dependent on the ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) of ANKRD13D, which are crucial for binding ubiquitinated proteins (Burana2016The). ANKRD13D also forms a ternary complex with VCP and caveolin-1 (Cav-1), a protein involved in lysosomal trafficking. This complex is significant for the regulation of endosomal trafficking, with ANKRD13D recognizing Lys-63-linked Ub chains on Cav-1 (Burana2016The).

ANKRD13D interacts with RNF11, a RING E3 ligase, in a UIM-dependent manner. This interaction is enhanced when the RING domain of RNF11 is inactivated, suggesting a role in modulating the stability of RNF11 (Mattioni2020Ring). ANKRD13D, along with ANKRD13A and ANKRD13B, colocalizes with RNF11 in perinuclear structures, likely recycling and late endosome vesicles (Mattioni2020Ring). These interactions highlight ANKRD13D's role in forming multiprotein complexes and influencing cellular signaling pathways.
