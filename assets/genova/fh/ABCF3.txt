# ABCF3

## Overview
ABCF3 is a gene that encodes the ATP-binding cassette subfamily F member 3 protein, which is part of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily. Unlike many ABC proteins that function as transporters, ABCF3 is unique in that it lacks transmembrane domains and is primarily involved in regulatory functions within the cytoplasm. The protein is characterized by two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) that facilitate ATP binding and hydrolysis, playing a crucial role in modulating protein translation and cellular stress responses (Peterson2019Biochemical; Fostier2020ABC‐F). ABCF3 is implicated in various cellular processes, including interactions with ribosomes and involvement in lipid metabolism, which are particularly relevant during viral infections (Peterson2019Biochemical). The gene is highly expressed in tissues such as the liver, heart, and pancreas, and is associated with cell proliferation, suggesting its essential role in cellular function (Dean2022The; Fostier2020ABC‐F).

## Structure
The ABCF3 protein is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily, specifically belonging to Class 2, which is characterized by the absence of transmembrane domains and the presence of two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) (Peterson2019Biochemical). These NBDs contain conserved motifs such as Walker A, Walker B, the ABC Signature, Q-loop, and Switch motifs, which are crucial for ATP binding and hydrolysis (Peterson2019Biochemical). The NBDs are likely arranged in a head-to-tail configuration, forming two ATP binding pockets (Peterson2019Biochemical).

The ABCF3 protein also features a P-site tRNA interaction motif (PtIM) linker domain, which connects the two NBDs and is involved in ribosome binding (Unknownauthors2023DecipheringtheStructuralandFunctionalPropertiesofABCFATPases). The PtIM is a conserved α-helical hairpin structure that interacts with tRNA (Unknownauthors2023DecipheringtheStructuralandFunctionalPropertiesofABCFATPases). The protein's activity is modulated by lipids, with certain lipids enhancing its ATPase activity and others inhibiting it (Peterson2019Biochemical).

ABCF3 interacts with the flavivirus resistance protein OAS1B, and this interaction has been demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation and fluorescence microscopy (Peterson2019Biochemical). The protein's structure and function are further elucidated by point mutations in the NBDs, which affect its ATPase activity differently, suggesting distinct roles for the two catalytic pockets (Peterson2019Biochemical).

## Function
ABCF3 is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family, which is involved in various cellular processes, including protein translation regulation. Unlike other ABC transporters, ABCF3 lacks transmembrane domains and is primarily involved in regulatory functions within the cytoplasm. It is associated with the ribosome and plays a role in modulating translation, potentially impacting protein synthesis and cellular stress responses (Peterson2019Biochemical; Fostier2020ABC‐F).

ABCF3 exhibits ATPase activity, with its two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) contributing to this function. The activity of ABCF3 is modulated by lipids such as sphingosine and sphingomyelin, which can either enhance or inhibit its ATPase activity, suggesting a role in lipid metabolism (Peterson2019Biochemical). This modulation is particularly relevant during flavivirus infections, where lipid metabolism is altered (Peterson2019Biochemical).

In humans, ABCF3 is highly expressed in the liver, heart, and pancreas, and is associated with cell proliferation. Its interaction with the protein TPD52L2, involving the first 200 residues of ABCF3, is required for its activity in cell proliferation (Fostier2020ABC‐F). The gene's essential nature is suggested by the absence of reported homozygotes for loss-of-function mutations, indicating its crucial role in cellular function (Dean2022The).

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the ABCF3 gene in human health, particularly in relation to cancer, has been explored in several studies. In ovarian cancer, downregulation of ABCF3 is associated with better sensitivity to chemotherapy and longer progression-free survival (PFS) (Seborova2019Association). This suggests that lower expression levels of ABCF3 may contribute to more favorable clinical outcomes in this context. However, the specific clinical significance of ABCF3 mutations in diseases other than ovarian cancer is not well-documented in the available literature (Dean2022The; Wang2021ATP‐binding).

While ABCF3 is part of the ABC transporter family, which is known for its role in drug resistance, the precise impact of ABCF3 mutations or expression changes on other diseases remains unclear. The gene's involvement in translational regulation and potential roles in antibiotic resistance have been noted, but specific associations with clinical conditions outside of cancer have not been detailed (Wang2021ATP‐binding). Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of ABCF3 in various diseases and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
ABCF3, a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, is involved in various protein interactions. In C. elegans, ABCF3 physically interacts with GCN-1, a relationship that is crucial for promoting apoptosis. This interaction is confirmed through yeast two-hybrid assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, which demonstrate that ABCF3 and GCN-1 form a protein complex in vivo. The interaction is necessary for maintaining the phosphorylation level of eukaryotic initiation factor 2a (eIF2a), which is important for translation initiation regulation (Hirose2014The).

In Arabidopsis, ABCF3 also interacts with GCN1, although it is not required for eIF2α phosphorylation, indicating a different functional context compared to C. elegans (Faus2021The).

In mammals, ABCF3 interacts with the flavivirus-resistance protein OAS1B. This interaction is significant for flavivirus resistance, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and colocalization studies. The interaction with OAS1B at the ER membrane is crucial for reducing viral RNA production, and knockdown of ABCF3 results in increased yields of West Nile Virus, highlighting its role in antiviral defense (Peterson2019Biochemical).
