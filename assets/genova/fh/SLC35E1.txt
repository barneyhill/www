# SLC35E1

## Overview
SLC35E1 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 35 member E1, which is part of the solute carrier family involved in the transport of nucleotide sugars across cellular membranes. This protein plays a crucial role in glycosylation, a process essential for proper protein and lipid function, impacting cell signaling and structural integrity. SLC35E1 is particularly significant in the regulation of zinc ion homeostasis in keratinocytes, the predominant cell type in the epidermis, thereby influencing skin health and conditions such as psoriasis (Xiaohua2019Association; Huang2023SLC35E1). Additionally, SLC35E1 has been implicated in various diseases, including metastatic prostate cancer and endometrial cancer, where it is associated with cancer progression and genetic predisposition, respectively (Liu2022Molecular; Shivakumar2019ExomeWide). The gene's involvement in these processes underscores its potential as a therapeutic target and prognostic marker in certain cancers.

## Function
SLC35E1 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of zinc ion homeostasis, particularly in keratinocytes, which are the predominant cell type in the epidermis. This regulation is crucial for maintaining normal skin physiology and preventing conditions such as psoriasis. In healthy human cells, SLC35E1 likely plays a role in maintaining zinc ion concentrations, which is essential for normal keratinocyte function and proliferation (Huang2023SLC35E1). The protein is thought to influence zinc ion localization and concentration within cells, impacting cellular processes such as proliferation and signaling pathways like Notch and Wnt, which are important for skin health (Huang2023SLC35E1).

SLC35E1 is also part of the solute carrier family, which is involved in transporting nucleotide sugars across cellular membranes, a process essential for glycosylation. Glycosylation is critical for proper protein and lipid function, affecting cell signaling and structural integrity. Although the specific role of SLC35E1 in glycosylation in healthy cells is not detailed, its involvement in these processes suggests it contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Xiaohua2019Association).

## Clinical Significance
The SLC35E1 gene has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in cellular processes. In metastatic prostate cancer, SLC35E1 is identified as a significant gene influencing cancer progression. Studies have shown that downregulation of SLC35E1 in prostate cancer cell lines leads to decreased cell migration, invasion, and proliferation, suggesting its involvement in cancer metastasis and proliferation. The gene's expression is associated with poorer prognosis in patients with high m6A risk scores, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in prostate cancer (Liu2022Molecular).

In endometrial cancer, SLC35E1 has been identified as a candidate predisposition gene through exome-wide rare variant analysis. The gene's association with endometrial cancer suggests that rare germline variants in SLC35E1 may contribute to the genetic predisposition to this disease (Shivakumar2019ExomeWide).

Additionally, SLC35E1 has been associated with leprosy in Chinese patients, although specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) did not meet the significance threshold in single loci analysis. The gene-based burden test, however, indicated an association with leprosy, suggesting a potential role in the disease's pathology (Xiaohua2019Association).

## Interactions
SLC35E1, a member of the solute carrier family, is implicated in various protein-protein interactions, although specific details about these interactions are limited. In the context of leprosy, SLC35E1, along with SLC35E2 and SLC35E2B, forms an isolated network, suggesting potential interactions among these proteins. This network was identified using the DAPPLE tool, which analyzes protein-protein interactions, although the study did not provide detailed functional insights into these interactions (Xiaohua2019Association).

In the study of major depressive disorder (MDD), SLC35E1 was identified as a differentially expressed gene and included in a protein-protein interaction network constructed to explore the interactions between proteins encoded by these genes. However, specific interactions involving SLC35E1 were not detailed in the study (Feng2019Seeking).

In metastatic prostate cancer, SLC35E1 is described as a nucleotide sugar transporter carrier. Its expression is linked to cancer progression, and silencing SLC35E1 was shown to reduce the proliferation and metastasis of prostate cancer cell lines. This suggests that SLC35E1 may interact with other proteins involved in cancer cell proliferation and metastasis, although specific interaction partners were not identified (Liu2022Molecular).
