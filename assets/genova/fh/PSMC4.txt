# PSMC4

## Overview
PSMC4 is a gene that encodes the protein proteasome 26S subunit, ATPase 4, which is a crucial component of the 26S proteasome complex. This complex is responsible for the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, a process essential for maintaining cellular protein homeostasis. The protein encoded by PSMC4 is part of the 19S regulatory subunit of the proteasome, which plays a significant role in the assembly and regulation of the proteasome complex. As an ATPase, it is involved in the unfolding and translocation of substrates into the proteolytic core of the proteasome. PSMC4 has been implicated in various cellular processes and diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's disease and cancers such as lung adenocarcinoma, highlighting its importance in both normal cellular function and disease pathogenesis (Ullah2022Evaluating; SalasLeal2023Differential).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PSMC4 gene have been implicated in several diseases, notably Parkinson's disease (PD) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). In Parkinson's disease, PSMC4 expression is significantly reduced in patients compared to healthy controls. This reduction is observed in the substantia nigra, a brain region critically affected in PD, and is associated with the presence of PSMC4 protein in Lewy bodies, which are characteristic of the disease. The downregulation of PSMC4 may contribute to PD pathogenesis by affecting protein degradation pathways, potentially leading to abnormal protein aggregation (SalasLeal2023Differential).

In contrast, PSMC4 is overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma tissues compared to normal lung tissues. This overexpression is linked to less methylated promoter regions, which typically result in increased gene expression. Genetic alterations in PSMC4, such as amplifications and missense mutations, are associated with poor overall survival in LUAD patients. The gene's overexpression is also correlated with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint gene expression, suggesting a role in the tumor microenvironment and potential implications for cancer prognosis and therapy (Ullah2022Evaluating; Jia2023Pancancer). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PSMC4 in both neurodegenerative and oncogenic contexts.

## Interactions
PSMC4, a component of the 26S proteasome complex, is involved in various protein interactions essential for its function in protein degradation. It is part of the 19S regulatory subunit, which plays a crucial role in the assembly and regulation of the 26S proteasome. This complex is responsible for the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, a process vital for maintaining cellular protein homeostasis (SalasLeal2023Differential).

In the context of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), PSMC4 has been shown to have a high level of co-expression with the Translocase of Inner Mitochondrial Membrane 50 (TIMM50) gene, with a correlation coefficient of 0.75, indicating a strong interaction at the gene expression level (Ullah2022Evaluating). This suggests that PSMC4 may be involved in mitochondrial processes, although the specific nature of this interaction requires further investigation.

In sickle cell disease, PSMC4 is part of a large cluster dominated by proteasome proteins, suggesting its interactions are primarily within this group. This clustering analysis indicates that PSMC4's interactions are significantly affected by the disease, potentially altering its function within the proteasome complex (Ammann2009Cluster).
