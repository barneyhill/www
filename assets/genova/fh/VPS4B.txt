# VPS4B

## Overview
VPS4B is a gene that encodes the vacuolar protein sorting 4 homolog B, a member of the ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities (AAA) protein family. This protein plays a pivotal role in the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) pathway, which is crucial for cellular processes such as membrane protein degradation, cytokinesis, and viral budding. The VPS4B protein is characterized by its ATPase activity, which is essential for the disassembly of ESCRT-III complexes, thereby facilitating endosomal trafficking and other cellular functions (Scott2005Structural; Chen2021VPS4B). It is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and is vital for maintaining normal cell proliferation and genomic stability (Morita2010Human). Alterations in the VPS4B gene have been linked to various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (Jiang2015High; Cui2013The).

## Structure
The VPS4B protein is a member of the AAA ATPase family, characterized by its involvement in endosomal sorting and other cellular activities. Its primary structure is encoded by the VPS4B gene, and the protein includes several distinct domains. The N-terminal MIT (Microtubule Interacting and Trafficking) domain is a three-helix bundle that interacts with ESCRT-III proteins through MIT Interacting Motifs (MIM1 and MIM2) (Hill2012Structure). The central region of VPS4B contains the AAA ATPase cassette, which is composed of large and small ATPase domains, a unique three-stranded antiparallel beta domain, and a C-terminal helix (Scott2005Structural; Hill2012Structure).

The secondary structure of VPS4B includes alpha helices and beta sheets, with the large ATPase domain featuring a six-stranded beta-sheet flanked by alpha helices, and the small domain forming an antiparallel four-helix bundle (Scott2005Structural). The tertiary structure of VPS4B forms a hexameric ring, crucial for its ATPase activity, with the beta domain playing a role in binding adaptor proteins like LIP5/Vta1p (Sun2017CryoEM; Scott2005Structural).

VPS4B can oligomerize into higher-order structures, such as double-ring assemblies, upon ATP binding, which is essential for its function in processes like HIV-1 budding (Scott2005Structural). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and has splice variant isoforms that could result in distinct functional properties.

## Function
VPS4B is a crucial component of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) pathway, playing a significant role in the disassembly of the ESCRT-III complex. This process is essential for the internalization and lysosomal degradation of membrane-associated proteins, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (Scott2005Structural; Chen2021VPS4B). VPS4B is involved in intracellular protein trafficking, cytokinesis abscission, and virus budding, and it regulates mitosis and cell division (Chen2021VPS4B). The protein localizes to the spindle pole during metaphase and the midbody during cytokinesis, ensuring proper spindle formation, chromosome alignment, and segregation (Morita2010Human).

In healthy human cells, VPS4B is expressed in almost all tissues and is vital for maintaining normal cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and preventing apoptosis (Chen2021VPS4B). It also plays a role in centrosome and spindle maintenance, with its depletion leading to defects in centrosome numbers and spindle formation, resulting in genomic instability (Morita2010Human). VPS4B's activity is necessary for normal endosomal trafficking, which is involved in cytokinesis (Morita2010Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the VPS4B gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. A splicing mutation, IVS7+46C>G, in the VPS4B gene is linked to dentin dysplasia type I (DDI), a dental condition characterized by tooth abnormalities such as malformed roots and premature tooth loss. This mutation leads to aberrant splicing, resulting in altered protein structure and reduced mRNA expression, affecting tooth development through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Yang2016A; Pan2019Vacuolar).

In cancer, VPS4B expression levels are significant. High expression of VPS4B is associated with poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In HCC, VPS4B is linked to accelerated cell proliferation and poor overall survival, making it an independent prognostic factor (Jiang2015High). Similarly, in NSCLC, high VPS4B expression correlates with tumor progression and poor survival outcomes (Liu2013Vacuolar).

VPS4B is also implicated in neurodegenerative diseases and cerebral ischemia. In cerebral ischemia, increased VPS4B expression is associated with apoptosis, suggesting its role in cell death pathways (Cui2013The). These findings highlight the clinical significance of VPS4B in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
VPS4B is a key component of the ESCRT pathway, interacting with various proteins to facilitate processes such as HIV-1 budding and endosomal sorting. It interacts with ESCRT-III proteins, including CHMP2A, CHMP1A, and CHMP1B, through its MIT domain, which binds to MIM motifs on these proteins. These interactions are crucial for the recruitment of VPS4B to ESCRT-III assemblies and for the disassembly of these complexes (Kieffer2008Two; Shim2008Novel).

VPS4B also forms complexes with LIP5, an adaptor protein that binds to the beta domains of fully assembled VPS4B, enhancing its interaction with ESCRT-III components. This interaction is important for the assembly and function of VPS4B in membrane-associated processes (Shim2008Novel; Scott2005Structural).

The protein undergoes oligomerization, forming higher-order complexes upon ATP binding, which is essential for its activity. Mutations affecting these interactions can inhibit processes like HIV-1 budding, highlighting the importance of VPS4B's structural integrity and its interactions with other proteins (Scott2005Structural; Thomas2011Stable).

VPS4B's interactions are not limited to stable complexes; it also engages in transient interactions, which are critical for its function in cellular processes such as cytokinesis and viral budding (Thomas2011Stable).
