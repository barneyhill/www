# CFAP410

## Overview
CFAP410 is a gene that encodes the cilia and flagella associated protein 410, also known as C21orf2, which is integral to the structure and function of cilia and flagella. This protein is characterized by a bimodular architecture, featuring a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motif at its N-terminal domain and an oligomeric helical bundle at its C-terminal domain. CFAP410 is primarily localized at the basal body of cilia, where it plays a crucial role in ciliogenesis and DNA damage repair. It is highly conserved across a wide range of species, underscoring its fundamental biological importance. The protein is involved in several key interactions, notably with NEK1, a component of a retinal ciliopathy-associated protein complex, which is essential for maintaining ciliary function and structure. Mutations in the CFAP410 gene have been linked to various clinical conditions, including retinal ciliopathies, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and skeletal ciliopathies, highlighting its significance in human health and disease (Stadler2022CFAP410; Ferguson2022Amyotrophic).

## Structure
The CFAP410 protein, also known as C21orf2, exhibits a bimodular architecture consisting of a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motif at its N-terminal domain (NTD) and an oligomeric helical bundle at its C-terminal domain (CTD) (Stadler2022CFAP410). The NTD features a canonical LRR motif with five tandem repeats forming a calzone-like structure, characterized by a flat β sheet on one side and an array of short α helices on the other, creating a hydrophobic core packed with conserved leucine residues (Stadler2022CFAP410). A long hairpin-like loop is tightly packed on top of the helical surface of the LRR motif, making extensive contacts through hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions (Stadler2022CFAP410).

The CTD forms a tetrameric structure, gathering four NTDs into a clustered protein complex (Stadler2022CFAP410). In humans, there are eleven isoforms of CFAP410, all containing an identical CTD (Stadler2022CFAP410). The NTD and CTD are connected by a long unstructured loop, and the NTD contains a conserved surface patch likely involved in binding interaction partners such as NEK1 (Stadler2022CFAP410). Mutations in CFAP410 can disrupt the oligomeric assembly of the CTD or destabilize the NTD structure, affecting its function (Stadler2022CFAP410).

## Function
CFAP410, also known as C21orf2, is a protein localized at the basal body of cilia and flagella, playing essential roles in ciliogenesis and DNA damage repair (Stadler2022CFAP410). It is highly conserved across various species, including algae, protists, and animals, and is primarily located at the basal body of cilia (Stadler2022CFAP410). The protein has a bimodular architecture, consisting of a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motif at its N-terminus and an oligomeric helical bundle at its C-terminus (Stadler2022CFAP410). The N-terminal domain (NTD) contains a conserved surface patch that is speculated to be involved in interactions with other proteins, such as NEK1, a component of a retinal ciliopathy-associated protein complex (Stadler2022CFAP410).

CFAP410 is involved in maintaining ciliary function and structure, which is crucial for processes like cell motility and signaling (Stadler2022CFAP410). Despite its role in ciliopathies, knockout studies in C. reinhardtii did not show significant changes in flagellar length or the percentage of flagellated cells, suggesting possible redundancy with other proteins (Stadler2022CFAP410). The protein's function in healthy cells may involve maintaining proper localization and interaction with other cellular components (Stadler2022CFAP410).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CFAP410 gene are associated with several diseases, primarily due to its role in ciliary function. One of the key conditions linked to CFAP410 mutations is cone-rod dystrophy, a type of retinal ciliopathy characterized by early onset visual decline and retinal dystrophy due to photoreceptor degeneration. This condition often presents with a cone-rod pattern of degeneration, where cone cells are affected earlier and more severely than rod cells (Chiu2021A). 

CFAP410 mutations have also been implicated in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), where variants such as V20M and R73P affect the DNA damage response, leading to motor neuron degeneration. These mutations increase the vulnerability of motor neurons to stress and disrupt interactions with proteins involved in DNA repair, contributing to ALS pathology (Ferguson2022Amyotrophic).

Additionally, CFAP410 is associated with axial spondylometaphyseal dysplasia, a ciliopathy that affects skeletal development (Ferguson2022Amyotrophic). The gene's variants are also linked to early-onset non-syndromic retinal degeneration and syndromic forms that may include skeletal ciliopathies (Bujakowska2024Coding). These findings highlight the gene's critical role in maintaining ciliary function and its impact on various clinical conditions.

## Interactions
CFAP410, also known as cilia and flagella associated protein 410, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its role in ciliogenesis. It is part of a retinal ciliopathy-associated protein complex that includes NEK1 and SPATA7. Direct interaction between CFAP410 and the C-terminal end of NEK1 has been observed in human cells, with structural modeling suggesting that the conserved surface patch on the N-terminal domain (NTD) of CFAP410 serves as the binding site for NEK1 (Stadler2022CFAP410). This interaction is supported by high-accuracy models of the HsCFAP410-NTD and HsNEK1-CTD complex, indicating a strong interaction between these proteins (Stadler2022CFAP410).

The NTD of CFAP410 contains a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motif with a highly conserved surface patch that is crucial for binding interaction partners. Mutations in this region can destabilize the protein structure and disrupt its interactions, which may include those with NEK1 (Stadler2022CFAP410). The C-terminal domain (CTD) of CFAP410 forms a tetrameric structure that clusters the NTDs into a protein complex, further emphasizing the importance of its interactions in maintaining cellular functions (Stadler2022CFAP410).
