# TCP11X2

## Overview
TCP11X2 is a gene that encodes the protein t-complex 11 family, X-linked 2, which is part of a family of proteins involved in various cellular processes. The protein encoded by TCP11X2 is categorized as a member of the t-complex protein family, which is known for its role in cellular signaling and regulation. Although the specific functions of TCP11X2 are not fully elucidated, proteins in this family are generally implicated in processes such as cell cycle regulation and signal transduction. The gene is located on the X chromosome, which suggests a potential role in sex-linked genetic pathways. Further research is needed to fully understand the interactions and clinical significance of TCP11X2, as well as its potential involvement in human diseases.
