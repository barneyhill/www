# NUDT7

## Overview
NUDT7 is a gene that encodes the protein nudix hydrolase 7, a member of the Nudix hydrolase family, which is characterized by its ability to hydrolyze nucleoside diphosphate derivatives. The protein is primarily known for its role as a CoA diphosphohydrolase, involved in the degradation of coenzyme A (CoA) and its derivatives, thereby playing a critical role in maintaining metabolic balance within cells. NUDT7 is predominantly expressed in the liver, where it regulates the levels of CoA and acyl-CoA pools, essential for lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis (Shumar2024Determining; Vickers2024Investigating). The protein's activity is modulated by nutritional states, increasing in the fed state and decreasing during fasting, which underscores its importance in metabolic adaptation (Shumar2024Determining). Additionally, NUDT7 has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including osteoarthritis and colorectal cancer, where its altered expression affects disease progression and cellular metabolism (Song2018Dysregulation; Song2020NUDT7).

## Structure
The NUDT7 protein, encoded by the human NUDT7 gene, is a member of the Nudix hydrolase family, which is involved in hydrolyzing nucleoside diphosphate derivatives. The primary structure of NUDT7 includes a conserved Nudix box, a motif essential for its enzymatic activity (Shumar2018Nudt19). This motif forms part of a structural motif that includes a β-strand-loop/helix/loop, contributing to the protein's secondary structure (Shumar2018Nudt19).

The tertiary structure of NUDT7 is characterized by its role as a CoA diphosphohydrolase, with specific residues involved in CoA binding and hydrolysis. Key residues within the Nudix box, such as E16, E19, and E20, are crucial for coordinating a divalent cation necessary for enzymatic activity (Shumar2024Determining). The quaternary structure of NUDT7 involves its function as a homodimer, which is important for its enzymatic activity and interaction with other proteins (Olejnik2009Mutational).

NUDT7 also contains a CoA box, which is involved in CoA binding, although the CoA-binding sites differ from those in other Nudix hydrolases like Nudt19 (Shumar2018Nudt19). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its function and interactions.

## Function
NUDT7 encodes a peroxisomal enzyme that plays a crucial role in the degradation of coenzyme A (CoA) and its derivatives, including a broad range of acyl-CoAs. This enzyme is highly expressed in the liver and is involved in maintaining the balance of CoA and acyl-CoA pools, which is essential for proper metabolic functioning (Shumar2024Determining; Vickers2024Investigating). NUDT7 hydrolyzes CoA species to 3′,5′-ADP and (acyl-)phosphopantetheine, a process vital for regulating hepatic CoA levels and lipid metabolism (Vickers2024Investigating).

The activity of NUDT7 is regulated by nutritional states, increasing in the fed state and decreasing during fasting. This regulation suggests its involvement in modulating CoA levels in response to metabolic changes, particularly during the transition between fed and fasted states (Shumar2024Determining). NUDT7's enzymatic activity influences the size and composition of the hepatic acyl-CoA pool, bile acid metabolism, and peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation (Vickers2024Investigating; Shumar2019Overexpression).

In healthy human cells, NUDT7 is considered a housekeeping enzyme, essential for regulating the concentration of various nucleotide substrates, cofactors, and signaling molecules, thereby maintaining cellular metabolism and preventing oxidative stress (Song2018Dysregulation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NUDT7 gene have been implicated in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA) and colorectal cancer (CRC). In osteoarthritis, NUDT7 is significantly downregulated in OA chondrocytes, leading to increased expression of cartilage-degrading enzymes such as MMP13, ADAMTS-4, and -5, as well as increased chondrocyte apoptosis and lipid accumulation. This downregulation contributes to cartilage degradation and reduced cartilage thickness, highlighting NUDT7's role in maintaining cartilage integrity and suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for OA (Song2018Dysregulation).

In colorectal cancer, particularly in the context of Kras G12D mutations, the loss of NUDT7 expression is associated with increased lipid accumulation and activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This leads to enhanced tumor growth and inflammation, as evidenced by increased polyp formation and adenocarcinoma development in Nudt7 knockout mice. The accumulation of palmitic acid due to NUDT7 suppression further stimulates Wnt/β-catenin signaling, suggesting that NUDT7 acts as a tumor suppressor in CRC. Restoring NUDT7 expression has been shown to reduce adenoma development, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target in CRC (Song2020NUDT7).

## Interactions
NUDT7, a member of the Nudix hydrolase family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. In Arabidopsis thaliana, AtNUDT7 interacts with the regulatory protein RACK1A, which is involved in multiple signaling pathways, including hormone responses and plant disease resistance. This interaction is facilitated by RACK1A acting as a scaffolding protein, potentially linking AtNUDT7 to the heterotrimeric G protein complex, although AtNUDT7 does not directly bind to the Gγ subunits AGG1 and AGG2 in vitro (Olejnik2001Arabidopsis).

Mutational analysis of AtNUDT7 has shown that specific amino acid residues are crucial for its interaction with the 14.3.3 protein, a regulator involved in various cellular processes. Mutations at residues F73 and V168 disrupt this interaction, highlighting the importance of these residues for protein-protein interactions (Olejnik2009Mutational).

In human studies, NUDT7 has been shown to cluster with other NUDIX enzymes, such as NUDT5, NUDT6, and NUDT9, suggesting potential interactions within this enzyme family. These interactions may play a role in maintaining nucleotide pool balance and regulating cellular metabolism (CarrerasPuigvert2017A).
