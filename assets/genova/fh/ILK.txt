# ILK

## Overview
Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a gene that encodes the protein integrin-linked kinase, a serine/threonine protein kinase involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and survival. The ILK protein is characterized by its unique structure, which includes an N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain, a pleckstrin homology-like motif, and a C-terminal kinase domain, although it functions primarily as a pseudokinase due to its atypical ATP-binding configuration (Fukuda2009The). ILK plays a crucial role in integrin-mediated signaling pathways by forming complexes with proteins such as PINCH and parvin, which are essential for linking integrins to the actin cytoskeleton (Chiswell2008The). This protein is involved in the phosphorylation of key signaling intermediates, influencing processes like cell growth, differentiation, and angiogenesis (Yen2014Roles). ILK's involvement in various signaling pathways makes it a significant player in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function, with implications in several diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disorders, and chronic kidney disease (de2019Chronic; Tsirtsaki2020The; Brodehl2019Mutations).

## Structure
Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a protein characterized by a distinct molecular structure comprising several domains. The ILK protein consists of an N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain, a middle pleckstrin homology (PH)-like motif, and a C-terminal kinase domain (KD) (Fukuda2009The). The ankyrin repeat domain includes five ankyrin repeats, which are involved in protein-protein interactions, particularly with the LIM1 domain of PINCH1, forming a left-handed superhelical spiral with a concave 'ankyrin groove' (Chiswell2008The). The kinase domain of ILK, although structurally similar to other kinases, is considered a pseudokinase due to its lack of catalytic activity. This is attributed to deviations in its ATP-binding configuration and catalytic core, such as a non-glycine-rich ATP-binding loop and a single Mg ion coordination (Fukuda2009The).

ILK forms a heterotrimeric complex with PINCH and parvin, which is crucial for cell adhesion and signaling (Chiswell2008The). The interaction with α-parvin is mediated by a pseudoactive site in the ILK KD, which is essential for its localization to focal adhesions (Fukuda2009The). ILK's structure and interactions suggest its role as an adaptor protein, facilitating the assembly of multiprotein complexes rather than acting as a conventional kinase (Fukuda2009The).

## Function
Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that plays a pivotal role in integrin-mediated cell signaling and cytoskeletal organization. It is primarily located at focal adhesions, where it connects integrins to the actin cytoskeleton, facilitating cell adhesion, migration, and survival (Attwell2003Integration; McDonald2008Integrinlinked). ILK functions as both a kinase and an adaptor protein, interacting with proteins such as CH-ILKBP and PINCH to form complexes that are essential for cell adhesion and spreading (Attwell2003Integration).

ILK is involved in the phosphorylation of key signaling intermediates like Akt and GSK3, which are crucial for cell survival and proliferation (McDonald2008Integrinlinked; Yen2014Roles). It regulates various cellular processes, including growth, differentiation, and angiogenesis, and is essential for normal development and tissue homeostasis (McDonald2008Integrinlinked). In the musculoskeletal system, ILK is vital for chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation, and its absence can lead to developmental defects such as dwarfism and chondrodysplasia (McDonald2008Integrinlinked).

In the cardiovascular system, ILK is crucial for endothelial cell survival and cardiac function, with its deletion leading to increased apoptosis and cardiomyopathy (McDonald2008Integrinlinked). ILK also plays a significant role in the central nervous system, where it is involved in neuronal polarity and survival through the ILK-Akt-GSK3 signaling axis (McDonald2008Integrinlinked). Overall, ILK is a central component in various signaling pathways that regulate cell motility, contractility, and survival in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ILK gene are implicated in several diseases. In breast cancer, ILK overexpression is associated with tumor progression and metastasis. It influences cell behaviors such as anoikis suppression, apoptosis, migration, invasion, and proliferation through pathways like PI3K/Akt, mTOR, and ERK (Tsirtsaki2020The). ILK also plays a role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), promoting a metastatic phenotype in breast cancer (Tsirtsaki2020The).

In arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM), mutations in the ILK gene, such as p.H77Y and p.P70L, have been linked to reduced cardiac function and survival in zebrafish models. These mutations are associated with arrhythmias and cardiac dysfunction, although no significant morphological changes were observed (Brodehl2019Mutations).

ILK is also involved in retinal diseases. Mutations in the ILK gene are associated with exudative vitreoretinopathy, a condition characterized by incomplete vascularization of the retina. These mutations affect ILK's role in vascular development and are linked to defects in the blood-retina barrier (Park2019Integrinlinked).

In chronic kidney disease, ILK expression is upregulated, contributing to kidney fibrosis and disease progression. ILK depletion in experimental models has shown potential in preventing disease progression (de2019Chronic).

## Interactions
Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a key component in cell-matrix adhesion, interacting with various proteins to form complexes that are crucial for cellular functions. ILK interacts with the β1 integrin cytoplasmic domain and several cytoplasmic adaptor proteins, including CH-ILKBP (also known as actopaxin or α-parvin), affixin (β-parvin), and paxillin, which are involved in linking integrins to the actin cytoskeleton (Sakai2003Integrinlinked; Wu2001Integrinlinked). ILK forms a multicomponent complex with PINCH, a LIM domain-only protein, and CH-ILKBP, which is essential for cell adhesion and spreading (Zhang2002Assembly; Wu2001Integrinlinked).

The interaction between ILK and PINCH is mediated by the ankyrin (ANK) repeats of ILK binding to the LIM1 domain of PINCH, which is critical for the stability and localization of the IPP complex to adhesion sites (Chiswell2008The). ILK also interacts with signaling proteins such as PKB/Akt and GSK-3, influencing cell signaling pathways, although its kinase activity is debated, with some studies suggesting it functions primarily as a scaffold protein (Wu2001Integrinlinked; Wickström2009The).
