# ARMC10

## Overview
ARMC10 is a gene that encodes the protein armadillo repeat containing 10, which is characterized by the presence of armadillo repeat domains involved in protein-protein interactions. This protein is categorized as a mitochondrial-associated protein due to its significant role in regulating mitochondrial dynamics, including processes such as fission and fusion. ARMC10 is primarily localized to the outer membrane of mitochondria and is involved in interactions with various proteins that are crucial for mitochondrial function and cellular energy regulation. The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by AMPK, which is essential for its role in mitochondrial fission, particularly under conditions of energy stress. ARMC10 has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, where it is suggested to play a protective role against mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal death (Chen2019Global; Huang2021ARMC; Serrat2014The).

## Structure
The ARMC10 protein is characterized by the presence of armadillo repeat domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions. The primary structure of ARMC10 includes a transmembrane domain located at the N-terminus, specifically between amino acids 7-29, and a putative cleavage site at amino acids 30-36 (Serrat2014The). The protein also contains a DUF634 domain, spanning amino acids 85-337, which includes up to six armadillo domains (Serrat2014The). 

ARMC10 is known to undergo post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation. A specific phosphorylation site at serine 45 (S45) is recognized by AMPK, which plays a role in regulating mitochondrial dynamics (Chen2019Global). This phosphorylation is crucial for mitochondrial fission, particularly under conditions of glucose starvation (Chen2019Global).

The protein exists in multiple isoforms, with variations in the N-terminal region. These isoforms differ in their sequence length, with a shorter isoform of 308 residues and a longer isoform of 343 residues, both containing the S45 phosphorylation site (Chen2019Global). The shorter isoform is the dominant form in human cells (Chen2019Global). ARMC10 is enriched in mitochondria, indicating its role in mitochondrial function and dynamics (Serrat2014The).

## Function
ARMC10 is a protein involved in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics, particularly in processes such as mitochondrial fission and fusion. It is phosphorylated by AMPK at the S45 site, which is crucial for its role in promoting mitochondrial fission, a process important for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and cell survival under energy stress conditions (Chen2019Global). ARMC10 is primarily localized to the outer membrane of mitochondria, with most of the protein found in the cytosol (Chen2019Global).

In neurons, ARMC10 interacts with the KIF5/Miro/Trak2 complex, which is essential for mitochondrial transport. This interaction is important for maintaining proper mitochondrial distribution, which is critical for neuronal function (Serrat2014The). Overexpression of ARMC10 can lead to mitochondrial aggregation and affect mitochondrial trafficking, indicating its role in maintaining appropriate protein levels for normal mitochondrial dynamics (Serrat2014The).

ARMC10 also plays a protective role against amyloid-beta-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and neuronal death, suggesting its involvement in neuroprotection (Serrat2014The). These functions highlight ARMC10's significant role in cellular energy regulation and mitochondrial dynamics.

## Clinical Significance
ARMC10 has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in cellular processes and interactions. In cancer, ARMC10 is suggested to function as a tumor suppressor gene, particularly in myeloid tumors and gliomas. Alterations in ARMC10 expression are associated with temozolomide (TMZ) resistance in glioma cell lines, where it interacts with proteins involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and immune response pathways (Huang2021ARMC). The gene is also linked to myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where specific isoforms of ARMC10, influenced by mutations in the SRSF2 gene, are upregulated and contribute to tumorigenicity by binding to p53 (Zhang2015Disease-associated).

In neurodegenerative diseases, ARMC10 is involved in mitochondrial dynamics and is suggested to play a protective role against mitochondrial dysfunction in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. It interacts with the KIF5/Miro1-2/Trak2 complex to prevent mitochondrial division and neuronal death, potentially inhibiting disease progression (Huang2021ARMC). Additionally, ARMC10's phosphorylation by AMPK at the S45 site is crucial for mitochondrial fission and fusion, processes that are vital for cellular energy regulation and survival under stress conditions (Chen2019Global).

## Interactions
ARMC10 is involved in several protein interactions that play a crucial role in mitochondrial dynamics. It interacts with proteins involved in mitochondrial fission, such as DNM1L (Drp1), MFF, MIEF1, MIEF2, MTFR1, MTFR2, BNIP3, and BAX. Specifically, ARMC10 binds to Drp1 and interacts with mitochondrial fission proteins MFF and FIS1, which are essential for Drp1 recruitment during mitochondrial fission (Chen2019Global). 

ARMC10 also interacts with the KIF5/Miro1-2/Trak2 complex, which is involved in mitochondrial trafficking. This interaction is significant in preventing amyloid-beta (Aβ)-induced mitochondrial division and neuronal death, suggesting a protective role against neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's Disease (Huang2021ARMC; Serrat2014The). Immunofluorescence analyses have shown strong colocalization of ARMC10 with Miro2 and Trak2, and partial overlapping with KIF5C, although no co-immunoprecipitation was detected with KIF5C, KIF5A, or KIF5B (Serrat2014The).

ARMC10 is phosphorylated by AMPK at the S45 site, which is crucial for its function in regulating mitochondrial fusion and fission. This phosphorylation event is part of the AMPK-mediated pathway that regulates mitochondrial dynamics (Chen2019Global; Huang2021ARMC).
