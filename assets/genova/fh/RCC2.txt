# RCC2

## Overview
RCC2, or Regulator of Chromosome Condensation 2, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in critical cellular processes, particularly during cell division. The RCC2 protein is a component of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), which is essential for proper mitotic progression and cytokinesis. Functioning as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), RCC2 regulates small GTPases such as Rac1 and Arf6, influencing cell cycle transitions, spindle assembly, and kinetochore-microtubule interactions. Beyond its role in mitosis, RCC2 is implicated in integrin-mediated signaling pathways, affecting cell adhesion and migration. Its dysregulation is associated with various cancers, where it contributes to tumor progression and chemoresistance, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Humphries2009Proteomic; Guo2021Regulator; Gong2019RCC2).

## Structure


## Function
RCC2, also known as Regulator of Chromosome Condensation 2, is a crucial protein involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, particularly during mitosis and cell division. It is a component of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), which includes Aurora B kinase, INCENP, and Survivin, and is essential for accurate cytokinesis. RCC2 plays a significant role in chromosomal alignment, spindle assembly, and cell cleavage by interacting with microtubules and the small G protein Rac1, facilitating the interaction of kinetochores with spindle microtubules (Guo2021Regulator).

RCC2 acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for RalA, modulating kinetochore-microtubule interactions, and is vital for the transition from prometaphase to metaphase and G2/M progression. It is also involved in interphase cell cycle progression, interacting with signaling components like Rac1 and Arf6. Low expression levels of RCC2 can inhibit the cell cycle by causing G1 and G2 arrest and blocking prometaphase, thus inhibiting cell proliferation (Guo2021Regulator).

In addition to its role in cell cycle regulation, RCC2 is involved in integrin-associated signaling pathways, regulating cell migration and adhesion. It acts as a dual regulator of Rac1 and Arf6, coordinating fibronectin-dependent adhesion signaling pathways, and is crucial for maintaining persistent migration in response to extracellular matrix cues (Humphries2009Proteomic).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RCC2 gene have significant clinical implications in various cancers. In ovarian cancer, RCC2 is implicated in chemotherapy resistance, with elevated expression levels observed in cisplatin-resistant tissues. This overexpression promotes cell proliferation and migration, while its knockdown inhibits these processes and induces apoptosis, suggesting RCC2 as a potential therapeutic target to overcome chemoresistance (Gong2019RCC2).

In gastric cancer, RCC2 is frequently overexpressed, enhancing cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Its interaction with the small GTPase RalA affects the MAPK/JNK signaling pathway, indicating a role in cancer progression (RCC2; Wang2020&lt; p&gt). Similarly, in colorectal cancer, RCC2 expression is associated with poor prognosis, particularly in microsatellite stable tumors. Low RCC2 expression correlates with advanced cancer stages and benefits from adjuvant chemotherapy in stage III patients (Bergsland2020Prediction).

RCC2 is also overexpressed in other cancers, such as lung and liver cancers, where it is linked to poor clinical outcomes. Its expression correlates with immune markers, suggesting potential as a biomarker for immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment (Gu2022A). These findings highlight RCC2's role in cancer progression and its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target.

## Interactions
RCC2, also known as TD-60, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It directly interacts with the small GTPase RalA, forming a stable complex that influences cell proliferation and migration, particularly in the context of cancer. This interaction is crucial in ovarian cancer, where RCC2 overexpression leads to increased RalA and RalBP1 expression, contributing to chemotherapy resistance (RCC2; Wang2020&lt; Gong2019RCC2; p&gt). RCC2 also interacts with HMGA2 in colorectal cancer, enhancing cell proliferation and migration while reducing apoptosis. This interaction promotes the transcriptional activation of HMGA2 downstream target genes, such as FN1 and IL11, which are involved in colorectal carcinogenesis (Gu2022A).

In addition to its role in cancer, RCC2 is a component of integrin-associated complexes, interacting with Rac1 and Arf6. It acts as a dual regulator, modulating the activation of these small GTPases, which affects cell adhesion, spreading, and migration (Humphries2009Proteomic). RCC2's interaction with Rac1 is particularly important for maintaining persistent migration by regulating integrin-mediated signaling pathways (Humphries2009Proteomic).
