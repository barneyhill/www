# CD6

## Overview
CD6 is a gene that encodes the CD6 protein, a type I transmembrane glycoprotein predominantly expressed on the surface of T cells and some B cells. The CD6 protein plays a pivotal role in the immune system by acting as a receptor involved in T-cell activation and differentiation. It is characterized by its extracellular region containing three scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domains, which facilitate interactions with other proteins, such as the activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM), to mediate cell adhesion and signaling processes essential for immune responses (Aruffo1991The; Carrasco2017Human). The CD6 protein is also involved in the formation and stabilization of the immunological synapse, contributing to T-cell proliferation and survival (Nair2010CD6). Additionally, CD6 is implicated in various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, with genetic variations influencing disease susceptibility and progression (Swaminathan2013Fine; CasadóLlombart2022Experimental).

## Structure
The CD6 protein is a type I integral membrane glycoprotein primarily expressed on T cells. It consists of 468 amino acids, with a 24 amino acid NH2-terminal signal sequence, a 26 amino acid hydrophobic membrane-spanning domain, and a 44 amino acid cytoplasmic domain (Aruffo1991The). The extracellular region of CD6 contains three scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domains, which are characteristic of a new family of cell surface and secreted proteins (Aruffo1991The). These domains are involved in peptide binding and are homologous to other proteins in the SRCR family, such as the human and mouse T cell antigen CD5 (Aruffo1991The).

CD6 undergoes significant post-translational modifications, including N-linked glycosylation, which contributes to its molecular mass. The mature form of CD6 is a 130 kDa glycoprotein, with N-linked oligosaccharides processed to a mature, Endo H-resistant form on the cell surface (Swack1991Biosynthesis). The protein is also phosphorylated on serine residues during T cell activation, suggesting a role in signal transduction pathways (Swack1991Biosynthesis). CD6 does not exhibit detectable kinase activity (Aruffo1991The). The presence of splice variant isoforms of CD6 may influence its function in immune responses.

## Function
The CD6 protein is a cell surface receptor primarily expressed on T cells and some B cells, playing a crucial role in immune response regulation. It is involved in T-cell activation and differentiation by interacting with the activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM), facilitating cell-to-cell adhesion and signaling processes essential for the formation of the immunological synapse (Nair2010CD6; Carrasco2017Human). This interaction is critical for T-cell proliferation and survival, enhancing sensitivity to interleukin-2 (IL-2) and promoting cytokine production, which influences T-cell differentiation (Nair2010CD6).

CD6 also interacts with the adaptor protein SLP-76, a positive regulator of T-cell activation, through a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism. This interaction is crucial for linking CD6 engagement to T-cell signaling pathways, contributing to the recruitment of signaling complexes necessary for T-cell activation (Hassan2006CD6). The CD6 protein's role in immune regulation is further supported by its involvement in the stabilization and maturation of the immune synapse, impacting T-cell proliferative responses and survival (Carrasco2017Human). CD6's function as a co-stimulatory molecule underscores its importance in modulating immune responses and maintaining immune homeostasis (Nair2010CD6).

## Clinical Significance
The CD6 gene is implicated in several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, with specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes associated with altered disease risk and progression. In multiple sclerosis (MS), the SNP rs17824933 is linked to increased susceptibility, with the G allele associated with higher expression of a CD6 isoform lacking the ligand-binding domain, affecting T cell proliferation and activation (Swaminathan2013Fine; CasadóLlombart2022Experimental). The rs2074225 SNP also shows a strong association with MS, particularly in the Spanish-Basque population, where the protective haplotype (CC) is linked to higher CD6 expression and IL-17A secretion (Swaminathan2013Fine).

In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, the CD6 rs17824933 G allele is associated with disease location and prognosis, while the rs12360861 A allele is linked to a better prognosis in Crohn's disease (CasadóLlombart2022Experimental). CD6 variations are also associated with psoriasis severity and Behçet's disease risk (CasadóLlombart2021Contribution).

The CD6 gene's interaction with its ligand, CD166/ALCAM, is significant in leukocyte transmigration across the blood-brain barrier, a critical process in MS pathogenesis (Wagner2014ALCAM). These genetic variations and interactions highlight CD6's role in modulating immune responses in various diseases.

## Interactions
CD6 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a significant role in T cell activation through its interactions with various proteins. It is known to associate with the adaptor protein SLP-76, a critical interaction for T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. This interaction is phosphorylation-dependent, specifically involving the phosphorylated tyrosine residue at position 662 on CD6, which binds to the SH2 domain of SLP-76 (Roncagalli2014Quantitative; Hassan2006CD6). CD6 also interacts with the protein Zap70, which is essential for the phosphorylation of CD6 and its subsequent ability to recruit SLP-76 (Roncagalli2014Quantitative).

CD6 forms part of a complex interactome, associating with both inhibitory mediators such as SHP-1, RasGAP, CBL-B, and SHIP-1, and positive regulators like LCK, ZAP-70, and VAV, which are involved in T cell activation (Santos2024The). It also interacts with the TCR/CD3 complex, co-localizing and co-transporting with it during the formation of the immunological synapse, suggesting a role in TCR signaling (Meddens2018Biophysical). These interactions highlight CD6's function as a signaling hub in T cell activation, independent of the Lat adaptor (Roncagalli2014Quantitative).
