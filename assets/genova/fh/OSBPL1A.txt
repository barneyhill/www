# OSBPL1A

## Overview
The OSBPL1A gene encodes the oxysterol-binding protein-like 1A, a member of the oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) family, which is integral to lipid metabolism and transport. This protein functions as an intracellular lipid receptor, primarily involved in the regulation of cholesterol levels and the facilitation of cholesterol transport and efflux from cells. Unlike other OSBP family members, OSBPL1A lacks a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which influences its specific binding properties and functional roles. It interacts with phospholipids rather than oxysterols like 25-hydroxycholesterol, and plays a critical role in cellular signaling pathways and lipid homeostasis. The protein's activity is linked to the stabilization of GTP-bound RAB7A on late endosomes and lysosomes, impacting the functional properties of these compartments. Mutations in OSBPL1A have been associated with altered cholesterol metabolism, highlighting its clinical significance in cardiovascular and metabolic disorders (Rao2024Receiver; van2016A; Jaworski2001A; Lehto2003The).

## Structure
The OSBPL1A gene encodes a protein that is part of the oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) family, which is involved in lipid metabolism and transport. The OSBPL1A protein consists of 438 amino acids and contains an OSBP domain but lacks a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, distinguishing it from other family members that possess this domain (Jaworski2001A). The OSBP domain is involved in binding oxysterols and phospholipids, although OSBPL1A specifically does not bind 25-hydroxycholesterol but instead binds phospholipids (Jaworski2001A).

The protein is encoded by a gene located on chromosome 18q11-12 and has a molecular mass of approximately 50.4 kDa (Jaworski2001A). OSBPL1A shares a high degree of sequence similarity with OSBPL2, forming a subgroup within the OSBP family, with 68% identity and 78% similarity at the peptide level (Jaworski2001A). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and localization. OSBPL1A also has splice variant isoforms, which can affect its expression patterns and functional roles in different tissues (Jaworski2001A).

## Function
OSBPL1A, also known as oxysterol-binding protein-like 1A, is a member of the oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) family, which plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism and transport. In healthy human cells, OSBPL1A is involved in regulating cholesterol levels and ensuring proper cholesterol transport and removal from cells. It is essential for maintaining adequate high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels and efficient cholesterol efflux, which is the process of transporting cholesterol out of cells (van2016A).

OSBPL1A functions as an intracellular lipid receptor, binding to oxysterols and phosphoinositides, which are important for its role in lipid homeostasis and cellular signaling pathways. The protein is active in cellular membranes, influencing lipid distribution and vesicle trafficking, which are critical for maintaining cellular lipid balance and signaling (Lehto2003The).

The protein's activity is linked to the stabilization of GTP-bound RAB7A on late endosomes/lysosomes, altering the functional properties of late endocytic compartments. This interaction is significant for the regulation of cellular processes related to lipid metabolism and transport (Rao2024Receiver).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the OSBPL1A gene have been linked to significant alterations in cholesterol metabolism, particularly affecting plasma HDL cholesterol levels and cholesterol efflux capacity. Individuals with a loss-of-function variant in OSBPL1A are predisposed to low plasma HDL cholesterol levels, which can impair the body's ability to remove excess cholesterol from the bloodstream. This impairment is clinically significant as it may increase the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, given the protective role of HDL cholesterol in cardiovascular health (van2016A).

Alterations in the expression or function of OSBPL1A can disrupt normal cholesterol homeostasis, potentially leading to metabolic disorders. These disruptions may influence conditions such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, as OSBPL1A is involved in lipid metabolism and intracellular lipid transport. The gene's role in maintaining cholesterol balance suggests that any significant deviations from its normal function could contribute to the pathogenesis of these metabolic disorders (van2016A).

The clinical significance of OSBPL1A mutations underscores the importance of this gene in maintaining normal lipid levels and preventing metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Understanding these genetic variations can aid in the development of targeted therapies for related conditions.

## Interactions
OSBPL1A, a member of the oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) family, is involved in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins. It is known to interact with RAB7A, a small GTPase, on late endosomes and lysosomes. This interaction is crucial for stabilizing GTP-bound RAB7A, which affects the functional properties of late endocytic compartments and is linked to tau secretion, a process associated with the propagation of tau pathology in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (Rao2024Receiver).

OSBPL1A is also part of a broader family of proteins that includes oxysterol-binding protein-related proteins (ORPs), which are involved in vesicle transport, lipid metabolism, and cell signaling. These proteins often contain an OSBP-type ligand-binding domain and may interact with phospholipids. While specific interactions of OSBPL1A with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed extensively, the OSBP family is known for its involvement in complex cellular functions, suggesting that OSBPL1A may participate in similar interactions (Jaworski2001A; Lehto2003The). The interactions of OSBPL1A with other proteins are essential for maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis and signaling pathways.
