# VIPR2

## Overview
The VIPR2 gene encodes the vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor 2 (VPAC2), a class B G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is integral to various physiological processes. This receptor is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure, which facilitates its role in signal transduction. VPAC2 primarily binds to vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), leading to the activation of downstream signaling pathways such as adenylate cyclase and phospholipase C, which are crucial for functions like smooth muscle relaxation, hormone secretion, and immune response modulation (Langer2022Signal; Lutz1999Structure). The receptor is expressed in multiple tissues, including the central nervous system and peripheral tissues, where it contributes to neuroprotection and circadian rhythm regulation (Langer2022Signal). Alterations in the VIPR2 gene have been linked to neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Vacic2011Duplications; Yin2023Identification).

## Structure
The human VIPR2 gene encodes the vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor 2 (VPAC2), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure typical of this receptor family. The primary structure of the VPAC2 receptor consists of 438 amino acids, with the amino-terminus encoded by the first five exons and the transmembrane domains by exons 5-12. The carboxyl tail is encoded by exon 13 (Lutz1999Structure). The receptor's secondary structure includes seven hydrophobic transmembrane spanning domains, which are integral to its function in signal transduction (Lutz1999Structure).

The tertiary structure of VPAC2 involves the folding of these transmembrane domains, facilitating interactions with its ligands, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP). The receptor's extracellular domain plays a crucial role in ligand binding, as demonstrated by the binding of artificial peptides to this region (Sakamoto2018Discovery).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, may occur, affecting the receptor's stability and function. The receptor is expressed in various tissues, including the brain and digestive tract, and is involved in numerous physiological processes (Lutz1999Structure). No splice variant isoforms have been identified for the VPAC2 receptor (Lutz1999Structure).

## Function
The VIPR2 gene encodes the vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor 2, a class B G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a significant role in various physiological processes. This receptor is primarily involved in the binding of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), which leads to the activation of adenylate cyclase and an increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. This signaling cascade is crucial for smooth muscle relaxation, hormone secretion, and modulation of immune responses (Langer2022Signal).

VIPR2 is expressed in several tissues, including the central nervous system and peripheral tissues, where it contributes to neuroprotection and the regulation of circadian rhythms (Langer2022Signal). In the immune system, VIPR2 is expressed at low levels in resting T cells and is not detectable in resting monocytes, indicating a role in immune modulation (Lara-Marquez2001Selective).

The receptor's activity is linked to the activation of downstream pathways, such as protein kinase A (PKA) and phospholipase C (PLC), which influence various cellular functions, including cell migration and neurotransmitter secretion (Langer2022Signal). These molecular processes underscore the receptor's involvement in maintaining homeostasis and responding to physiological stimuli.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the VIPR2 gene have been significantly associated with schizophrenia. Studies have identified that duplications of the VIPR2 gene increase the risk of developing schizophrenia, suggesting that these genetic changes may contribute to the disorder's pathogenesis (Vacic2011Duplications; Nieratschker2011Genomewide). These duplications lead to increased expression of the VIPR2 gene, which is thought to result in excessive signaling through the VPAC2 receptor, potentially disrupting normal brain function and contributing to schizophrenia (Ago2021Probing; Nieratschker2011Genomewide).

In the Chinese Han population, specific non-synonymous mutations and frameshift deletions in the VIPR2 gene have been identified in patients with schizophrenia, indicating a potential role in the disorder's susceptibility (Yin2023Identification). Some of these mutations are predicted to significantly impact the structure and function of the VPAC2 receptor, which may affect neurological development and synaptic plasticity (Yin2023Identification).

Beyond schizophrenia, VIPR2 duplications have also been observed in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), although the association with ASD requires further confirmation (Ago2021Probing; Firouzabadi2016Copy). These findings suggest that VIPR2 may play a broader role in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders.

## Interactions
VIPR2, or vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor 2, is a G protein-coupled receptor that interacts with various proteins to mediate its physiological effects. VIPR2 primarily interacts with its natural ligands, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), to activate downstream signaling pathways (Sakamoto2018Discovery). These interactions are crucial for processes such as smooth muscle relaxation and secretion in exocrine glands.

VIPR2 is involved in the regulation of cancer cell migration through its interaction with the PI3K/PI(3,4,5)P3 pathway. This interaction promotes the formation of lamellipodia, which are essential for cell motility. VIPR2's role in this process involves its interaction with WAVE2, a protein that regulates actin filament remodeling, thereby influencing cell migration (Asano2022Vasoactive).

The receptor also interacts with various G proteins, including Gs, Gi, and Gq, to mediate different signaling pathways. These interactions lead to the activation of adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C, influencing cAMP production and calcium signaling, respectively (Lu2022Targeting; MacKenzie2001Mechanisms). VIPR2's ability to couple with these G proteins highlights its role in diverse physiological responses.
