# CDR2

## Overview
CDR2 is a gene that encodes the cerebellar degeneration-related protein 2, a cytoplasmic protein primarily expressed in cerebellar Purkinje neurons. This protein is involved in critical cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and calcium homeostasis. CDR2 interacts with the transcription factor c-Myc through its helix-leucine zipper (HLZ) motif, sequestering c-Myc in the cytoplasm and preventing its nuclear translocation, which is essential for maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing neuronal apoptosis (Okano1999The). Additionally, CDR2 forms a complex with calbindin, a calcium-binding protein, playing a role in calcium regulation within Purkinje cells (Schubert2014Paraneoplastic). The gene is clinically significant due to its association with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD), a disorder linked to autoimmune responses against ectopically expressed CDR2 in tumors, leading to neurological degeneration (Corradi1997A; Yshii2020Immunological).

## Function
The CDR2 protein, encoded by the CDR2 gene, plays a significant role in regulating cellular processes in healthy human cells, particularly in the cerebellum. CDR2 is primarily expressed in cerebellar Purkinje neurons, where it interacts with the transcription factor c-Myc. This interaction occurs through the helix-leucine zipper (HLZ) motif of CDR2, which allows it to bind specifically to the HLZ motif of c-Myc. As a result, CDR2 sequesters c-Myc in the cytoplasm, preventing its nuclear translocation and subsequent transcriptional activity. This regulation is crucial for maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing excessive signaling that could lead to neuronal apoptosis (Okano1999The).

In addition to its role in transcriptional regulation, CDR2 is involved in calcium homeostasis within Purkinje cells. It forms a complex with calbindin, a calcium-binding protein, and its internalization can disrupt calcium regulation, potentially leading to altered synaptic integrity and function (Schubert2014Paraneoplastic). CDR2's expression is restricted to immune-privileged sites, such as the brain and testis, suggesting a specialized role in these tissues (Corradi1997A).

## Clinical Significance
The CDR2 gene is clinically significant due to its association with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD), a neurological disorder often linked to ovarian and breast tumors. In PCD, the immune system mistakenly targets the cerebellum, leading to neurological degeneration. This autoimmune response is triggered by the ectopic expression of the CDR2 protein in tumors, which are normally restricted to immune-privileged sites like neurons and testis (Okano1999The; Corradi1997A). 

Mutations or gains in the CDR2 gene in tumors can lead to higher protein expression or proteins with missense mutations, which are characteristic of tumors from PCD patients but not observed in other ovarian carcinomas (Yshii2020Immunological). The presence of anti-Yo antibodies, which target CDR2, is a key diagnostic marker for PCD, particularly in female patients with gynecologic carcinomas (Yshii2020Immunological). 

The interaction between CDR2 and the oncogene c-Myc is crucial for regulating c-Myc-dependent transcription. In PCD, autoantibodies disrupt this interaction, potentially leading to Purkinje neuronal death (Okano1999The). This disruption highlights the role of CDR2 in maintaining neuronal health and its involvement in the pathogenesis of PCD.

## Interactions
CDR2, a cytoplasmic protein, is known for its specific interaction with the c-Myc protein, a transcription factor involved in cell cycle regulation. This interaction is facilitated by the helix-leucine zipper (HLZ) motif of CDR2, which binds selectively to the HLZ domain of c-Myc. The interaction has been demonstrated using yeast two-hybrid systems and confirmed in vitro with GST pull-down assays, showing that CDR2 binds strongly to c-Myc but not to other proteins like Max or bicoid (Okano1999The). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments in transfected cell lines and mouse cerebellum further confirm the direct interaction between CDR2 and c-Myc, with c-Myc antibodies precipitating CDR2 and vice versa (Okano1999The).

CDR2 also interacts with calbindin (CB), a calcium homeostasis regulator, forming a strong protein complex. This interaction is significant in Purkinje cells, where CDR2 and CB co-immunoprecipitate, indicating an endogenous complex (Schubert2014Paraneoplastic). The internalization of CDR2 antibodies can disrupt CB function, affecting calcium homeostasis and leading to neurodegenerative changes in Purkinje cells (Schubert2014Paraneoplastic). These interactions highlight CDR2's role in both transcriptional regulation and calcium homeostasis, with implications for neuronal health and disease.
