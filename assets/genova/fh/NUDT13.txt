# NUDT13

## Overview
NUDT13 is a gene that encodes the protein nudix hydrolase 13, a member of the Nudix hydrolase family, which is characterized by its ability to hydrolyze nucleoside diphosphate derivatives. This protein is primarily localized in the mitochondria, where it plays a critical role in nucleotide metabolism by exhibiting NAD(P)H pyrophosphohydrolase activity. This enzymatic function is essential for maintaining the redox balance within cells by regulating the NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H ratios, thereby influencing various cellular processes, including oxidative stress response and energy metabolism (Abdelraheim2017Mouse; Kulikova2020Role). NUDT13 is implicated in several physiological and pathological contexts, including its involvement in neuroprotection in Parkinson's disease and its altered expression in certain cancers, highlighting its potential significance in both health and disease (Corradini2014Complex; Wright2021Role).

## Function
NUDT13 is a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating nucleotide metabolism. It is part of the Nudix hydrolase family, which is involved in hydrolyzing nucleoside diphosphate derivatives. NUDT13 exhibits NAD(P)H pyrophosphohydrolase activity, showing a strong substrate preference for NADH and NADPH. This activity is crucial for regulating the NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H ratios within mitochondria, which are important for maintaining the redox state of the cell and influencing enzymatic activities and signaling processes (Abdelraheim2017Mouse; Kulikova2020Role).

The enzyme is localized in the mitochondria, where it efficiently hydrolyzes NADH and NADPH, resulting in the production of AMP and NMNH, and 3′,5′-ADP and NMNH, respectively (Abdelraheim2017Mouse). This hydrolysis process is essential for reducing oxidized glutathione and regenerating thioredoxin, thereby protecting cells from oxidative stress (Abdelraheim2017Mouse). NUDT13's activity is optimal at alkaline pH and requires high concentrations of divalent metal cations, particularly Mn2+ (Kulikova2020Role).

In healthy human cells, NUDT13 is essential for cell survival and cell cycle regulation, particularly in non-cancerous colon epithelial-derived cell lines (CarrerasPuigvert2017A). Its role in regulating mitochondrial NAD levels suggests it is crucial for cellular energy metabolism and maintaining mitochondrial energy balance (Kulikova2020Role).

## Clinical Significance
NUDT13 has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in oxidative stress response and nucleotide metabolism. In Parkinson's disease, NUDT13 is identified as a significant hub in gene expression networks within the locus coeruleus, suggesting its involvement in neuroprotection and maintenance of brain homeostasis. This is particularly relevant in the context of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by oxidative damage (Corradini2014Complex).

In breast cancer, NUDT13 is up-regulated in hormone receptor-positive cases, although its specific role in cancer progression remains underexplored (Wright2021Role). The gene's expression is also significantly altered in clear cell renal cell carcinoma, with differences noted between cancerous and healthy tissues, although the clinical implications of these changes are not fully detailed (Wang2017NUDT).

NUDT13's expression and function have been studied in various cell lines, revealing its essential role in non-cancerous cells and potential involvement in cell cycle regulation. Alterations in its expression can lead to cell cycle disruptions, which may contribute to disease progression (CarrerasPuigvert2017A). Additionally, DNA methylation patterns of NUDT13 have been observed in colorectal cancer, though the clinical significance of these findings is not explicitly addressed (Hajebi2023Analyzing).
