# CACNA1F

## Overview
The CACNA1F gene encodes the calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1 F, a critical component of the L-type voltage-gated calcium channel, specifically the CaV1.4 channel. This protein is predominantly expressed in the retina, where it plays a vital role in photoreceptor function by mediating calcium ion influx necessary for neurotransmitter release. The CaV1.4 channel is characterized by its slow inactivation kinetics and is essential for the sustained release of glutamate, facilitating visual signal transmission from photoreceptors to bipolar cells. Mutations in the CACNA1F gene are associated with several X-linked retinal disorders, including X-linked congenital stationary night blindness type 2A and Åland Island Eye Disease, highlighting its significance in maintaining visual acuity and adaptation to light changes (McRory2004TheCACNA1FGene; BechHansen1998Lossoffunction; Marziali2022Optic). Additionally, the gene's expression in the hippocampus and cerebellum links it to neurocognitive disorders, further underscoring its broad physiological importance (Schaare2023Concomitant).

## Structure
The CACNA1F gene encodes the Ca v 1.4 α1 subunit, a component of the L-type voltage-gated calcium channel. This protein is primarily expressed in the retina and plays a crucial role in photoreceptor function. The primary structure of the Ca v 1.4 α1 subunit consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the protein, which includes six transmembrane regions (S1-S6) repeated in four equivalent domains (I-IV) (Schaare2023Concomitant). The secondary structure features α-helical segments, with the S4 helix acting as a voltage sensor and the S5 and S6 segments forming the ion channel and selectivity filter (Sallah2020Using).

The tertiary structure of the Ca v 1.4 α1 subunit has been modeled using homology modeling techniques, covering significant portions of the protein, specifically residues 67-414, 516-766, and 858-1580 (Sallah2020Using). This model includes four transmembrane domains, each with six α-helical segments (Sallah2020Using). The quaternary structure involves the assembly of the α1 subunit with other subunits to form the functional calcium channel complex.

Splice variants of the Ca v 1.4 channel, such as Ca v 1.4a and Ca v 1.4b, have been identified, which alter the channel's voltage-gating properties. Ca v 1.4a lacks exons 31-34 and 37, while Ca v 1.4b has a frameshift resulting in 40% homology with Ca v 1.1 at the C-terminus (Schaare2023Concomitant). These variants suggest potential functional diversity in different tissues.

## Function
The CACNA1F gene encodes the CaV1.4 L-type calcium channel, which plays a critical role in the retina by mediating calcium ion influx necessary for neurotransmitter release from photoreceptor cells. This channel is essential for the sustained release of glutamate, a neurotransmitter crucial for visual signal transmission from photoreceptors to bipolar cells in the retina (McRory2004TheCACNA1FGene; CHANG2006Thenob2mouse). The CaV1.4 channel is characterized by its slow inactivation kinetics and sensitivity to dihydropyridine, making it well-suited for maintaining tonic calcium influx at typical photoreceptor resting potentials (McRory2004TheCACNA1FGene).

In healthy human cells, the CACNA1F gene product is localized to the presynaptic side of photoreceptor terminals, where it facilitates continuous calcium-dependent neurotransmitter release, crucial for proper synaptic transmission in the outer plexiform layer of the retina (CHANG2006Thenob2mouse). The channel's function is vital for the depolarization of ON-bipolar and horizontal cells, leading to the generation of the corneal positive b-wave in electroretinography (ERG) testing (BechHansen1998Lossoffunction). The proper functioning of the CACNA1F gene ensures effective synaptic transmission and normal visual processing, highlighting its importance in maintaining visual acuity and adaptation to light changes (HemaraWahanui2005ACACNA1Fmutation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CACNA1F gene are associated with several X-linked retinal disorders, most notably X-linked congenital stationary night blindness type 2A (CSNB2A), Åland Island Eye Disease (AIED), cone-rod dystrophy 3 (CORDX3), and X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP) (Schaare2023Concomitant; Marziali2022Optic). CSNB2A is characterized by night vision disturbances, poor visual acuity, and a reduced b-wave response on electroretinogram (ERG) testing, linked to the inactivation of calcium channels in the retina (BechHansen1998Lossoffunction; Zeitz2015Congenital). AIED presents with fundus hypopigmentation and foveal hypoplasia (Marziali2022Optic).

The CACNA1F gene encodes the alpha 1-subunit of an L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel, crucial for synaptic transmission in the retina. Mutations can lead to either loss or gain of function, affecting the Cav1.4 channel activity and disrupting glutamate release from photoreceptors to bipolar cells (Zeitz2015Congenital). These disruptions result in various phenotypes, including icCSNB and cone/cone-rod dystrophies (Zeitz2015Congenital).

In addition to ocular symptoms, CACNA1F mutations are linked to neurocognitive disorders such as intellectual disability, epilepsy, and autism spectrum disorder, reflecting the gene's expression in the hippocampus and cerebellum (Schaare2023Concomitant). The gene's involvement in optic neuropathy has also been suggested, with symptoms like reduced visual acuity and optic disc pallor observed in some patients (Marziali2022Optic).

## Interactions
The CACNA1F gene encodes the Ca V 1.4 calcium channel, which is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its function in the retina. The wild-type Ca V 1.4 channel interacts with filamin proteins, specifically filamin A and filamin B, which are cytoskeletal proteins that enhance the targeting of ion channels to the plasma membrane and increase current densities (Doering2008Modified). This interaction is facilitated by a proline-rich region in the wild-type channel, which is absent in the mutant Ca V 1.4 nob2 variant, potentially affecting its interaction with filamin and its targeting to the plasma membrane (Doering2008Modified).

The Ca V 1.4 channel also plays a role in synaptic organization by interacting with proteins involved in synaptic scaffolding, such as Bassoon, Piccolo, and RIM2. These interactions are essential for the proper formation and maintenance of synaptic ribbons in photoreceptor cells (Zabouri2013Calcium). RIM1/2 proteins, in particular, facilitate the opening of Ca V 1.4 channels, enhancing calcium influx necessary for vesicle release at rod ribbon synapses (Grabner2015RIM12Mediated). These interactions underscore the importance of Ca V 1.4 in maintaining synaptic integrity and function in the retina.
