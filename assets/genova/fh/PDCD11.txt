# PDCD11

## Overview
PDCD11 (programmed cell death 11) is a gene that encodes a nucleolar protein involved in the critical processes of ribosomal RNA processing and ribosome biogenesis. The PDCD11 protein is essential for the maturation of 18S rRNA, a key component of the small ribosomal subunit, thereby playing a pivotal role in protein synthesis and cellular growth. As a component of the ribonucleoprotein complex, PDCD11 interacts with various nucleolar proteins, facilitating the assembly and function of ribosomes. Its regulatory functions extend to interactions with significant cellular pathways, including the NF-κB signaling pathway and the p53 tumor suppressor pathway, highlighting its involvement in cell cycle regulation and immune responses. The gene's expression and function are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis, and its dysregulation has been linked to pathological conditions such as cancer and ischemic diseases (Ding2023Programmed; Yoshida2017Elevation; Yang2020Yolk).

## Structure


## Function
PDCD11 (programmed cell death 11) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in ribosomal RNA processing and ribosome biogenesis. The PDCD11 protein is primarily located in the nucleolus, where it plays a crucial role in the maturation of 18S rRNA, a component of the small ribosomal subunit. This function is essential for proper protein synthesis and cellular growth. The protein's involvement in ribosome biogenesis highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and supporting the fundamental processes of protein synthesis. The nucleolar localization of PDCD11 underscores its role in the early stages of ribosome assembly, which is critical for the production of functional ribosomes necessary for translating mRNA into proteins. This activity is vital for cell growth and proliferation, as ribosomes are the cellular machinery responsible for protein synthesis. The precise regulation of PDCD11 and its interactions within the nucleolus ensure the fidelity of ribosomal RNA processing, which is crucial for the overall efficiency and accuracy of protein synthesis in healthy human cells. The gene's function in these molecular processes underscores its significance in maintaining cellular and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PDCD11 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in cancer and ischemic conditions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), PDCD11 acts as an oncoprotein that accelerates cancer progression by facilitating the G2/M transition of the cell cycle. High levels of PDCD11 are associated with poor prognosis in CRC patients, as they promote cell proliferation and survival, even under DNA damage stress. PDCD11 achieves this by upregulating CDC25C and CDK1, crucial for the G2/M transition, in both p53-dependent and independent manners. It also ubiquitinates and degrades p53 through an HDM2-dependent mechanism, destabilizing the p53 protein and influencing CRC progression (Ding2023Programmed).

In the context of ischemic conditions, elevated autoantibody levels against PDCD11 have been observed in patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) and stroke. This elevation suggests an autoimmune response potentially triggered by PDCD11 leakage from ischemic brain tissues. The presence of these autoantibodies is considered a potential biomarker for TIA, indicating a role for PDCD11 in ischemic brain lesions (Yoshida2017Elevation).

PDCD11 is also involved in microglia differentiation in zebrafish, where its deficiency leads to impaired microglia maturation and increased inflammation, suggesting its role in neurodegenerative conditions (Yang2020Yolk).

## Interactions
PDCD11, or programmed cell death 11, is involved in several protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. In colorectal cancer (CRC) cells, PDCD11 interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53 and the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase HDM2. These interactions primarily occur in the nucleoplasm, where PDCD11 forms complexes with p53 and HDM2, facilitating the ubiquitination and degradation of p53. This process is crucial for the regulation of the G2/M transition in cancer cells, as it helps maintain low levels of p53, promoting cell cycle progression (Ding2023Programmed).

PDCD11 also interacts with components of the NF-κB signaling pathway. It modulates the activity of NF-κB family members, such as P65 and c-Rel, by enhancing the nuclear transport of c-Rel and inhibiting the nuclear translocation of P65. These interactions influence the expression of TGFβ1, which is important for macrophage differentiation and microglia development (Yang2020Yolk).

In addition to these interactions, PDCD11 is known to be part of the ribonucleoprotein complex, interacting with nucleolar proteins like NOP56 and NOP58, which are components of the small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) complex. These interactions are essential for ribosomal RNA processing.
