# IL9

## Overview
Interleukin 9 (IL-9) is a cytokine encoded by the IL9 gene, which plays a pivotal role in the immune system by modulating the growth and differentiation of various hematopoietic cells. The IL9 gene is responsible for the production of the IL-9 protein, a member of the IL-2 cytokine family, characterized by a four-helical bundle structure. This cytokine is primarily produced by activated T cells, particularly Th2 cells, and exerts its effects through the IL-9 receptor (IL-9Rα), which is part of the hematopoietin receptor superfamily. The interaction between IL-9 and its receptor is crucial for activating downstream signaling pathways, such as the JAK/STAT pathway, which influences immune responses and inflammation. IL-9 is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including asthma, allergic diseases, and certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (De2022Structural; Demoulin1996A; Gounni2000IL9).

## Structure
The human IL9 protein is characterized by a four-helical bundle fold with an up-up-down-down topology, typical of the IL-2 cytokine family. This structure includes two long loops (AB and CD) and a shorter BC-loop, with the B-helix being notably short and flexible. The flexibility of the IL9 structure is supported by ten cysteines forming disulfide bridges, which are highly conserved among IL9 orthologs (De2022Structural). 

The primary structure of IL9 consists of 144 amino acids, with the mature protein forming a helical bundle stabilized by five disulfide bridges (De2022Structural). The IL9 protein also contains a conserved domain shared with IL-7, particularly in residues 92-101, which is crucial for its function (Singh2020De).

In terms of quaternary structure, IL9 interacts with its receptor IL-9Rα, forming a complex that involves a hydrophobic interface and some polar interactions. Specific residues such as Arg91 and Lys94 on IL9 interact with the receptor's loops, contributing to the high affinity of the complex (De2022Structural). The IL9:IL9Rα complex is further involved in recruiting the common gamma chain (γc) for signaling (De2022Structural).

## Function
Interleukin 9 (IL-9) is a multifunctional cytokine primarily produced by activated T cells, particularly Th2 cells. It plays a significant role in the immune system by influencing the growth and differentiation of various hematopoietic cells. IL-9 stimulates the proliferation of activated T cells and enhances the production of immunoglobulin E (IgE) from B cells, which is crucial for immune responses (Gounni2000IL9; Demoulin1998Interleukin). It also promotes the proliferation and differentiation of mast cells, contributing to their growth and function, especially in response to pathogens (Goswami2011A; Demoulin1998Interleukin).

IL-9 exerts its effects through the IL-9 receptor, which is part of the hematopoietin receptor superfamily. This receptor is essential for IL-9's biological activities, including growth stimulation and protection against apoptosis, by activating the JAK/STAT signaling pathway (Zhao2013IL9; Demoulin1996A). The receptor's interaction with the IL-2 receptor γ chain links IL-9 to the IL-2 cytokine family, sharing common signal transduction pathways (Demoulin1996A).

In the respiratory system, IL-9 affects bronchial epithelial cells by stimulating the release of chemotactic factors, which are important for immune responses in the lungs (Little2001IL9). These functions highlight IL-9's role in modulating immune responses and inflammation, with implications for conditions such as asthma and allergic diseases (Gounni2000IL9).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the IL9 gene are associated with various diseases and conditions. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in IL9 have been linked to an increased risk of cutaneous malignant melanoma, although IL-9 can inhibit melanoma cell growth, indicating a complex role in cancer (Yazdani2019Features). In other cancers, such as human malignant lymphoma, anaplastic lymphoma, Hodgkin disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma, IL-9 may promote tumor growth by enhancing cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis (Yazdani2019Features).

In autoimmune diseases, increased IL-9 levels are observed in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), where they correlate with disease activity and inflammatory markers (OUYANG2013Increased). IL-9 is also implicated in rheumatoid arthritis, where it contributes to inflammation and tissue damage (Chakraborty2019An).

In asthma, IL-9 is linked to airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness. Overexpression of IL-9 in animal models leads to asthma-like symptoms, and its gene is located in a region associated with asthma susceptibility (SoussiGounni2001Role; Temann1998Expression). IL-9's role in allergic diseases is further supported by its involvement in promoting IgE production and mast cell proliferation (SoussiGounni2001Role).

## Interactions
Interleukin 9 (IL-9) is a cytokine that interacts primarily with its receptor, IL-9Rα, to initiate signaling pathways. IL-9 binds to IL-9Rα with high affinity, characterized by a low nanomolar dissociation constant, through an entropy-driven, largely hydrophobic interface. The C-helix of IL-9 is the main entry point for IL-9Rα, and this interaction is crucial for the recruitment of the common gamma chain (γc) to form a ternary complex, although the presence of γc significantly decreases the overall affinity of the complex (De2022Structural).

The interaction between IL-9 and IL-9Rα involves specific residues such as Arg91 and Lys94, which interact with the BC2-loop and EF-loop of the receptor, respectively. This interaction is characterized by a hydrophobic interface with an average area of 849 Å², and is further stabilized by polar interactions (De2022Structural).

IL-9 signaling involves the activation of JAK1 and JAK3 kinases, leading to the activation of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 pathways. These interactions are essential for the cytokine's role in immune response regulation, influencing cell proliferation and differentiation, particularly in T cells and mast cells (De2022Structural).
