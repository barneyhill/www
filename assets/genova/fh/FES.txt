# FES

## Overview
The FES gene encodes a non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinase known as the FES proto-oncogene, tyrosine kinase. This kinase is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell growth, and differentiation. The FES protein is characterized by its unique structure, which includes an N-terminal FCH domain, coiled-coil domains, an SH2 domain, and a catalytic region, distinguishing it from other kinases by the absence of an SH3 domain and a negative regulatory tyrosine-phosphorylation site. Functionally, FES is expressed in hematopoietic progenitor cells and plays a crucial role in myeloid cell differentiation, cell adhesion, and cytoskeletal dynamics. It is involved in signaling pathways downstream of cytokine receptors and is active in various cellular compartments, including the cytoplasm and plasma membrane. Clinically, FES has been implicated in several cancers, where its expression and activity can influence tumor progression and response to treatment (Voisset2010FES; Greer2002Closing; Scheijen2002Tyrosine).

## Structure
The FES proto-oncogene encodes a nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase involved in various cellular processes. The FES protein is characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function. It contains an N-terminal FCH domain, three coiled-coil domains, an SH2 domain, and a catalytic region (Fes-CR) at the C-terminus (Gnemmi2006Expression). The FCH domain is implicated in microtubule binding, suggesting a role in cytoskeletal rearrangement and vesicular transport (Gnemmi2006Expression). The SH2 domain acts as a positive regulator of kinase activity and provides a binding site for effectors or regulatory proteins (Maru1995Tyrosine).

The catalytic domain, Fes-CR, is essential for the enzymatic activity of the protein and is a target for designing specific inhibitors. This domain consists of 262 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 29,502.88 Da (Gnemmi2006Expression). The FES protein lacks the SH3 domain and a negative regulatory tyrosine-phosphorylation site, distinguishing it from other nonreceptor PTKs like Src kinases (Gnemmi2006Expression). The protein can undergo post-translational modifications such as tyrosine phosphorylation, which is crucial for its interaction with other proteins like BCR and IL-4R (Izuhara1994Interaction; Maru1995Tyrosine).

## Function
The FES proto-oncogene encodes a non-receptor tyrosine kinase involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell growth, and differentiation. In healthy human cells, FES is primarily expressed in hematopoietic progenitor cells, mature granulocytes, monocytes, and vascular endothelial cells (Scheijen2002Tyrosine). It plays a significant role in myeloid cell differentiation and is associated with the regulation of cell adhesion and cytoskeletal dynamics (Greer2002Closing).

FES is involved in signaling pathways downstream of cytokine receptors, such as those for GM-CSF, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, and erythropoietin, which lack intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (Greer2002Closing). It mediates signals by becoming phosphorylated upon ligand binding, affecting various signaling pathways, including those involving RasGAP, Stat3, and Cas (Scheijen2002Tyrosine). The kinase is active in the cytoplasm, nuclear, and plasma membrane fractions, and is involved in vesicular trafficking (Scheijen2002Tyrosine).

In macrophages, FES is implicated in cell adhesion and cell-cell signaling, particularly during immune responses, suggesting its involvement in myelopoiesis and specialized functions of myeloid cells (Jücker1997The). Despite its roles, FES is not essential for normal myeloid development, as evidenced by studies in Fes-deficient mice (Scheijen2002Tyrosine).

## Clinical Significance
The FES gene, encoding a tyrosine kinase, plays a significant role in various cancers due to mutations and altered expression levels. In colorectal cancer, mutations in the FES gene, such as M704V, R706Q, V743M, and S759F, have been identified. These mutations reduce FES kinase activity, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role for FES in this context (Delfino2006A). FES expression is typically reduced or absent in colorectal cancer tissues, and its reintroduction into cancer cell lines has been shown to suppress tumor growth, indicating its potential as a tumor suppressor (Delfino2006A).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), FES is activated as part of the FLT3 receptor signaling complex. It is essential for cell survival and proliferation, particularly in the presence of FLT3-ITD mutations, which are common in AML. FES deficiency in these cells leads to reduced expression of anti-apoptotic proteins and increased senescence, highlighting its role in oncogenic signaling pathways (Voisset2010FES).

In bladder cancer, FES expression varies with tumor grade and is associated with higher proliferation and invasiveness in high-grade tumors, suggesting a complex role in cancer progression (Asai2017Pathological).

## Interactions
The FES proto-oncogene, a tyrosine kinase, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular signaling pathways. FES interacts with the KIT receptor, particularly in cells expressing the KIT D816V mutation, where it becomes phosphorylated and acts as a critical effector in the signaling pathway, influencing cell proliferation (Voisset2007The). FES also associates with the interleukin-4 receptor (IL-4R), where it becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated upon IL-4 stimulation, suggesting a role in IL-4 mediated signaling pathways (Izuhara1994Interaction).

In macrophages, FES phosphorylates specific proteins involved in cell adhesion and signaling, such as the crk-associated substrate (Cas) and a distinct 130-kDa protein, indicating its involvement in immune responses and cell-cell interactions (Jücker1997The). FES also forms a stable complex with the BCR protein, leading to its phosphorylation and association with the GRB-2/SOS complex, linking FES to RAS signaling pathways (Maru1995Tyrosine). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of FES in cellular processes, including growth regulation and immune signaling.
