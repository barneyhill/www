# AFG2A

## Overview
AFG2A is a gene that encodes the AFG2 AAA ATPase homolog A, a protein that plays a crucial role in cellular processes related to ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis. This protein is categorized as an ATPase, which is a type of enzyme that hydrolyzes ATP to provide energy for various cellular activities. AFG2 AAA ATPase homolog A is a component of the AIRIM complex, which is essential for maintaining proper ribosome levels and mRNA translation, particularly during brain development. Disruptions in the function of this protein, often due to mutations in the AFG2A gene, are linked to a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders, underscoring its significance in neurological health (Ni2024An).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AFG2A gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). These disorders include intellectual disabilities, seizures, hearing loss, and microcephaly. The AFG2A gene is part of the AIRIM complex, and disruptions in this complex primarily result in NDDs rather than other ribosomopathies (Ni2024An). Human genetic studies have identified allelic variants in AFG2A linked to these conditions, highlighting the gene's role in maintaining proper ribosome levels and mRNA translation during brain development (Ni2024An).

Patients with AFG2A variants often exhibit central nervous system abnormalities, such as severe neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by global developmental delay, muscular hypotonia, limb spasticity, dystonia, and sensory impairments. Neuroimaging of affected individuals shows severe brain atrophy and impaired myelination (Ni2024An). The research suggests that defects in ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis capacity during critical stages of brain development can lead to these disorders (Ni2024An).

The study also indicates that mitochondrial dysfunction may contribute to increased cell death in mutant organoids, further implicating AFG2A in the pathogenesis of these neurodevelopmental conditions (Ni2024An).
