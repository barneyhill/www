# ADORA3

## Overview
The ADORA3 gene encodes the adenosine A3 receptor (A3AR), a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains. This receptor is involved in a variety of physiological processes, including modulation of immune responses, inflammation, and protection of tissues during ischemic events. The A3AR is predominantly expressed in immune cells and plays a crucial role in regulating immune cell function and inflammatory responses through various signaling pathways, such as NF-κB and PI3K/AKT (Butler2012Impairment; Gao2022Species). Additionally, the receptor is implicated in cell growth regulation, exhibiting antiproliferative effects on tumor cells while promoting normal cell proliferation (Ohana2000Differential). The ADORA3 gene's involvement in diseases such as autism spectrum disorder and chronic lymphocytic leukemia underscores its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Kanduri2010Differential; Campbell2013Rare).

## Structure
The ADORA3 gene encodes the adenosine A3 receptor (A3 AR), a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a polypeptide chain that forms seven transmembrane (TM) helices. The receptor has an extracellular N-terminus and a cytosolic C-terminus, connected by three intracellular loops (ICLs) and three extracellular loops (ECLs) (Cheong2011The). The A3 AR is subject to post-translational modifications, including glycosylation in the extracellular region and palmitoylation in the C-terminal domain. These modifications play roles in receptor recognition, modulation, desensitization, and internalization (Cheong2011The).

The receptor's tertiary structure involves specific interactions within the transmembrane regions, such as hydrophobic interactions involving residues like Leu91, Leu246, Met177, and Val178 (Cheong2011The). The A3 AR can form high-ordered molecular structures, including homodimers, although heterodimerization with other receptors has not been observed (Cheong2011The).

Key residues involved in ligand binding and receptor activation include Trp243, Cys88, Thr94, His95, Asp107, Tyr109, Lys152, Gln167, Phe182, Asn250, His272, Asn274, and Tyr282. Mutations at these sites generally decrease ligand binding, indicating their importance in receptor function (Cheong2011The). The receptor's binding pocket is delineated by transmembrane regions 3, 5, 6, 7, and the second extracellular loop (ECL2) (Cheong2011The).

## Function
The ADORA3 gene encodes the adenosine A3 receptor (A3AR), a G protein-coupled receptor involved in various physiological processes. In healthy human cells, A3AR plays a significant role in modulating immune responses and inflammation. It is highly expressed in immune cells, including neutrophils, where it influences migration and the inflammatory response through purinergic feedback loops (Butler2012Impairment; Gao2022Species). A3AR activation is linked to signaling pathways such as NF-κB and PI3K/AKT, which are crucial for regulating immune cell function and cytoskeletal dynamics (Butler2012Impairment).

A3AR is also involved in protecting tissues during ischemic events, such as in neural and cardiac tissues, by mediating ischemic preconditioning (Atkinson1997Cloning). The receptor's activation can lead to reduced cytoplasmic cAMP levels, which is relevant to its function in healthy cells (Atkinson1997Cloning). Additionally, A3AR influences cell growth by modulating cell proliferation and apoptosis, with its activation having antiproliferative effects on tumor cells while stimulating normal cell proliferation, such as in bone marrow cells (Ohana2000Differential). These diverse roles highlight the receptor's importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ADORA3 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In the context of ASD, rare coding variants such as Leu90Val and Val171Ile have been identified in individuals with the disorder. The Leu90Val variant is associated with increased serotonin transporter (SERT) activity, which may contribute to ASD risk by affecting serotonin regulation (Campbell2013Rare). These variants show incomplete penetrance, indicating that not all carriers exhibit the disorder, and their effects on SERT activity differ, with Leu90Val showing significant functional impact (Campbell2013Rare).

In CLL, ADORA3 is involved in the activation of the nuclear factor B (NFB) pathway, which is significant in cell proliferation and immune response. The gene's methylation status varies, influencing its expression and potentially contributing to the proliferation of CLL cells, particularly in poor-prognostic subsets like the IGHV unmutated subgroup (Kanduri2010Differential). These findings suggest that ADORA3 may play a role in tumorigenesis and could be a target for therapeutic interventions in CLL (Kanduri2010Differential).

## Interactions
The adenosine A3 receptor (ADORA3) is a G protein-coupled receptor that participates in various interactions influencing cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with the serotonin transporter (SERT) through a Gq-linked stimulation of guanyl cyclase-mediated cGMP synthesis, leading to the activation of protein kinase G (PKG) and a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent elevation of SERT surface expression (Campbell2013Rare). This interaction is specific, as demonstrated by the loss of A3AR agonist stimulation of SERT in A3AR knockout mice (Campbell2013Rare).

ADORA3 is also involved in inflammatory signaling pathways. It interacts with transcription factors NF-kB and CREB, which are upregulated in autoimmune inflammatory diseases, contributing to its over-expression in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and Crohn's disease (Ochaion2009The). The receptor's signaling is linked to the PI3K-PKB/Akt pathway, which regulates these transcription factors (Ochaion2009The).

In diabetic nephropathy, ADORA3 influences the nuclear distribution of NF-κB, affecting the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, and is involved in caspase 1 activation (Garrido2019Blockade). These interactions highlight ADORA3's role in modulating inflammatory and apoptotic pathways.
