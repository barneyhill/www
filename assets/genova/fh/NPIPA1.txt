# NPIPA1

## Overview
The NPIPA1 gene encodes the nuclear pore complex interacting protein family member A1, a protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of nuclear-cytoplasmic transport. This protein is involved in the interaction with the nuclear pore complex, which is essential for the transport of molecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. NPIPA1 is categorized as a nuclear pore complex-associated protein, and its function is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper signal transduction. The gene is located on chromosome 16p13.11, a region known for its involvement in various chromosomal abnormalities and associated disorders. Alterations in NPIPA1 expression have been linked to several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and multiple system atrophy, as well as developmental disorders related to cardiac left-right patterning (Wang2019Detecting; Mills2016Strandspecific; Yu2024De).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
NPIPA1 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in nuclear pore complex interactions. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), NPIPA1 is identified as a hub gene within dysregulated subnetwork modules, suggesting its involvement in dysfunctional signal transduction pathways. This is supported by its interaction with MAP2K4, a gene associated with the MAPK family, indicating potential disruptions in mRNA and protein transport in AD (Wang2019Detecting).

In the context of multiple system atrophy (MSA), NPIPA1 is noted to be significantly down-regulated, with a fold change of -5.83, highlighting its potential role in the disease's pathology (Mills2016Strandspecific). This down-regulation may contribute to the neurodegenerative processes observed in MSA.

NPIPA1 is also involved in chromosomal abnormalities at 16p13.11, which are associated with cardiac left-right patterning defects. Micro-duplications and deletions in this region, including NPIPA1, have been observed in patients with congenital heart disease and other related conditions, suggesting a link between NPIPA1 and these developmental disorders (Yu2024De).

Overall, alterations in NPIPA1 expression and interactions are associated with a range of neurodegenerative and developmental disorders, although further research is needed to fully elucidate its clinical significance.
