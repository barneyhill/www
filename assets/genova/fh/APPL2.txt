# APPL2

## Overview
APPL2 is a gene that encodes the adaptor protein, phosphotyrosine interacting with PH domain and leucine zipper 2, which is involved in various cellular processes, including endocytic trafficking, signal transduction, and apoptosis. The protein is characterized by its domain organization, comprising an NH2-terminal BAR domain, a central PH domain, and a COOH-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding domain (PTB), which facilitate its interactions with membrane receptors and phosphoinositides (Pyrzynska2012Multifunctional; Wang2020The). APPL2 primarily functions in early endosomes, where it regulates endosomal dynamics and cellular responses, impacting cell proliferation and survival (Ruan2016Adiponectin). It acts as a negative regulator in adiponectin signaling by competing with its homolog APPL1 for binding to adiponectin receptors, thereby influencing metabolic processes such as AMPK activation and glucose uptake (Engin2017Adiponectin-Resistance). Additionally, APPL2 is involved in the regulation of the PI3K/AKT/NF-kB pathway and autophagy, contributing to its roles in insulin sensitivity, glucose uptake, and cellular longevity (Li2024Lack). The protein's interactions with various partners, such as TBC1D1 and Rab31, further underscore its significance in cellular signaling and metabolic regulation (Cheng2014The; Yeo2016Distinct).

## Structure
APPL2 is a protein characterized by its domain organization, which includes an NH2-terminal BAR domain, a central PH domain, and a COOH-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding domain (PTB) (Wang2020The). The BAR domain is involved in dimerization and is crucial for interactions with other proteins, such as RacGAP1, which affects Rac1 activation and F-actin remodeling in pancreatic β-cells (Wang2020The). The PH domain facilitates interactions with phosphoinositides, contributing to its role in endosomal trafficking and signal transduction (Pyrzynska2012Multifunctional).

APPL2 forms homodimers or heterodimers with its homolog APPL1, primarily through the BAR-PH domains (Wang2020The). This dimerization is essential for its function in various cellular processes, including insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (Cheng2014The; Wang2020The). APPL2's interaction with TBC1D1 in skeletal muscle is mediated by its BAR domain, which is critical for its role as a negative regulator of glucose transport (Cheng2014The).

The protein's structure also includes a leucine zipper motif, which is important for its function in endocytosis and signaling pathways (Pyrzynska2012Multifunctional). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, as well as post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available literature.

## Function
APPL2 is a multifunctional adaptor protein involved in various cellular processes, including endocytic trafficking, signal transduction, and apoptosis. It is primarily active in early endosomes, where it regulates endosomal dynamics and cellular responses, impacting cell proliferation and survival. APPL2 shares structural similarities with APPL1, including a BAR domain, a PH domain, and a PTB domain, which facilitate its interactions with membrane receptors and phosphoinositides (Ruan2016Adiponectin).

In adiponectin signaling, APPL2 acts as a negative regulator by competing with APPL1 for binding to adiponectin receptors AdipoR1 and AdipoR2. This competitive inhibition blocks adiponectin signaling, affecting processes such as AMPK activation, hepatic glucose uptake, and fatty acid oxidation (Engin2017Adiponectin-Resistance). APPL2 can also form heterodimers with APPL1, further preventing APPL1's interaction with adiponectin receptors and impairing adiponectin's actions (Cheng2014Signaling).

APPL2 is involved in the regulation of the PI3K/AKT/NF-kB pathway in macrophages, influencing insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake in skeletal muscle cells (Ruan2016Adiponectin). It also plays a role in autophagy, a process that declines with age, and is associated with ageing (Li2024Lack). APPL2's interaction with RAB5A, which binds to the PtdIns3K complex, promotes autophagy activity, providing insights into its role in cellular longevity (Li2024Lack).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the APPL2 gene have been associated with several metabolic and immune-related conditions. Variations in APPL2 are linked to overweight and obesity in individuals with normal glucose tolerance, suggesting a role in metabolic regulation (Liu2017APPLs:). APPL2 is also implicated in the regulation of insulin signaling, where its overexpression in muscle cells impairs insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake, potentially contributing to insulin resistance (Liu2017APPLs:).

In the context of immune responses, APPL2 plays a significant role in FcγR-mediated phagocytosis in macrophages. It enhances Akt signaling and decreases p38 MAPK signaling, which are crucial for macrophage survival and function. Alterations in APPL2 expression can affect these signaling pathways, potentially impacting immune responses and phagocytic efficiency (Yeo2015Rab31).

APPL2 is also upregulated in glioblastoma multiforme, where it promotes tumor cell growth and resistance to apoptosis, indicating its involvement in cancer progression (Liu2017APPLs:). These findings suggest that APPL2 could be a potential target for therapeutic interventions in metabolic disorders, immune dysfunctions, and certain cancers.

## Interactions
APPL2 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It is known to interact with TBC1D1, a Rab-GTPase-activating protein, in skeletal muscle. This interaction is crucial for regulating insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, as APPL2 inhibits the phosphorylation of TBC1D1 at Thr-596, a step necessary for GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane (Cheng2014The). The interaction between APPL2 and TBC1D1 is enhanced by insulin stimulation and is mediated by the BAR domain of APPL2 (Cheng2014The).

APPL2 also interacts with the Follicle Stimulating Hormone Receptor (FSHR) in HEK 293 cells, forming a stable association that is not affected by FSH treatment. This interaction is confirmed through immunoprecipitation experiments (Nechamen2007APPL1). APPL2 can form homotypic and heterotypic interactions with APPL1, mediated by their BAR domains, as demonstrated in yeast two-hybrid systems and coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Chial2007Membrane).

In macrophages, APPL2 is involved in Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling, where it enhances Akt signaling and regulates receptor internalization. It interacts with Rab31, which mediates its recruitment to macropinosomes (Yeo2016Distinct).
