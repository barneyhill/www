# NUB1

## Overview
NUB1 is a gene that encodes the protein known as the negative regulator of ubiquitin-like proteins 1, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of protein degradation pathways within the cell. The NUB1 protein is characterized as an adaptor protein, facilitating the targeting of NEDD8, a ubiquitin-like protein, to the proteasome for degradation. This function is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating processes such as cell growth and proliferation. NUB1's interaction with the proteasome is mediated through its ubiquitin-like domain, which binds to the S5a subunit of the 19S proteasome activator, underscoring its role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Kamitani2001Targeting). The gene's expression is influenced by interferon, and its protein product is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it also interacts with other proteins such as TRF1 and AIPL1, impacting telomere integrity and visual function, respectively (Kito2001NUB1; Akey2002The). NUB1's involvement in cellular processes extends to clinical implications, where it is associated with tumor suppression in cancer and the degradation of tau protein in neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its potential therapeutic significance (Hosono2010NUB1; Guarascio2019Negative).

## Function
NUB1 (negative regulator of ubiquitin-like proteins 1) is a protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of the NEDD8 conjugation system, which is essential for various cellular processes. NUB1 interacts specifically with NEDD8, a ubiquitin-like protein, and targets it for proteasomal degradation, thereby acting as a potent down-regulator of NEDD8 expression (Kamitani2001Targeting; Tanji2005Interaction). This interaction is facilitated by NUB1's ubiquitin-like domain, which allows it to bind to the S5a subunit of the 19 S proteasome activator, suggesting that NUB1 serves as an adaptor between the proteasome and NEDD8 conjugates (Kamitani2001Targeting).

NUB1 is involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of NEDD8, leading to a reduction in NEDD8 monomers and conjugates, which has significant implications for cell growth and proliferation (Kito2001NUB1). It is also implicated in the regulation of TRF1, a telomere-associated protein, by promoting its proteasomal degradation, which is crucial for maintaining telomere integrity and function (Jeong2016NEDD8). NUB1 is predominantly localized in the nucleus and is induced by interferon, highlighting its role in cellular processes related to protein modification and signaling (Kito2001NUB1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the NUB1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. In cancer, NUB1 is considered a tumor suppressor due to its role in mediating anti-proliferative actions and apoptosis in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells. Its expression is induced by interferon-alpha (IFN-α), leading to growth inhibition and apoptosis in sensitive RCC cell lines. However, some RCC cell lines, such as A498, are resistant to IFN-α-mediated growth inhibition, although overexpression of NUB1 can still induce apoptosis in these cells (Hosono2010NUB1; Tan2016Inhibition). NUB1 also affects tumor metastasis and invasion by modulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) proteins, which is significant in gastric cancer (Arshad2021NUB1).

In neurodegenerative diseases, NUB1 is involved in the degradation of tau protein, which is associated with Alzheimer's disease. It facilitates the degradation of tau through the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy, reducing tau aggregation and phosphorylation. This suggests a protective role against tauopathies, where tau aggregation is a hallmark (Guarascio2019Negative). Alterations in NUB1 expression or function could therefore impact the progression of neurodegenerative conditions (Guarascio2019Negative).

## Interactions
NUB1 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in the regulation of protein degradation. It specifically binds to NEDD8, a ubiquitin-like protein, targeting it and its conjugates for proteasomal degradation. This interaction is crucial for down-regulating the NEDD8 conjugation system, as NUB1 acts as a negative regulator by facilitating the transfer of NEDD8 to the proteasome (Kamitani2001Targeting).

NUB1 also interacts with the S5a subunit of the 26S proteasome. This interaction occurs through the C-terminal region of NUB1, specifically between amino acid residues 536 and 584, rather than through its ubiquitin-like domain (Tanji2005Interaction). This binding is essential for NUB1's function in targeting NEDD8 and its conjugates to the proteasome (Kamitani2001Targeting).

Additionally, NUB1 interacts with AIPL1, a protein associated with Leber congenital amaurosis. This interaction is specific and involves the C-terminal region of NUB1, which facilitates binding to AIPL1 (Kanaya2004Abolished; Akey2002The). The interaction between NUB1 and AIPL1 has been confirmed in mammalian cells, indicating its physiological relevance (Akey2002The).
