# FAR2

## Overview
The FAR2 gene encodes the enzyme fatty acyl-CoA reductase 2, which is a key player in lipid metabolism. This enzyme is categorized as a reductase and is primarily involved in the conversion of fatty acyl-CoA to fatty alcohols, a critical step in the biosynthesis of ether lipids and wax esters. These lipids are integral to cell membrane structure and function, as well as cellular signaling. Fatty acyl-CoA reductase 2 is predominantly active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it contributes to the production of plasmalogens, a type of glycerophospholipid with notable antioxidant properties (Cioffi2021A). The expression of FAR2 is tissue-specific, with significant levels observed in the eyelid, skin, small intestine, and brain, suggesting its involvement in diverse physiological processes, including neurological functions (Cioffi2021A). The enzyme's activity is also linked to the synthesis of molecules involved in inflammation and tissue remodeling, highlighting its importance in both normal physiology and disease states (Cioffi2021A).

## Structure


## Function
The FAR2 gene encodes the enzyme fatty acyl-CoA reductase 2, which plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism by reducing fatty acyl-CoA to fatty alcohols. This enzymatic activity is essential for the biosynthesis of ether lipids and wax esters, which are important components of cell membranes and are involved in cellular signaling processes (Cioffi2021A). FAR2 is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum of cells, where it contributes to the production of plasmalogens, a class of glycerophospholipids that contain a vinyl-ether bond. Plasmalogens are known for their antioxidant properties, which are attributed to the oxidation state of the vinyl-ether bond (Cioffi2021A).

In healthy human cells, FAR2 is expressed in various tissues, with the highest levels found in the eyelid, skin, and small intestine. The brain also expresses relatively high levels of FAR2 mRNA, indicating its potential involvement in neurological processes (Cioffi2021A). The enzyme's activity is linked to the generation of platelet activating factor precursors and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, both of which are involved in inflammatory responses and tissue remodeling (Cioffi2021A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the FAR2 gene have been implicated in several conditions, particularly those involving sebaceous gland dysfunction and lipid metabolism. In mice, mutations in FAR2 lead to sebaceous gland abnormalities and primary cicatricial alopecia, a condition characterized by hair loss and scarring of hair follicles. These mice exhibit changes in sebaceous gland morphology and lipid composition, including lower levels of wax esters and cholesterol esters, which suggest a disruption in sebum homeostasis (Sundberg2018Sebaceous).

While no specific human diseases have been directly linked to FAR2 mutations, increased expression of FAR2 has been associated with conditions such as IgA nephropathy, lupus nephritis, and diabetic nephropathy (Sundberg2018Sebaceous). In the context of cancer, FAR2 expression is upregulated in aggressive cancer cells, suggesting a potential role in cancer progression and resistance mechanisms (Kim2020Peroxisome). The gene's involvement in lipid metabolism, particularly in the reduction of fatty acyl-CoA to fatty alcohols, indicates its broader significance in metabolic pathways and potential implications in disorders related to lipid dysregulation (Malheiro2014Plasmalogens).
