# MATN2

## Overview
MATN2 is a gene that encodes the protein matrilin-2, a member of the matrilin family of extracellular matrix proteins. Matrilin-2 is characterized by its complex domain structure, which includes von Willebrand factor A (vWFA) domains, epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) modules, and a C-terminal coiled-coil oligomerization domain. This protein plays a crucial role in the assembly and stabilization of extracellular matrix (ECM) structures by interacting with various ECM components, such as collagens and non-collagenous proteins, thereby functioning as an adapter protein. Matrilin-2 is expressed in a wide range of tissues, contributing to the structural integrity and organization of collagen fibrils and other ECM components. The gene's expression and the protein's interactions are implicated in several physiological and pathological processes, including neuroinflammation and immune regulation, highlighting its clinical significance in conditions like multiple sclerosis and allergic rhinitis (PIECHA2002Matrilin2; Wang2019MiR2025pMATN2; Jonas2014Axonally).

## Structure
Matrilin-2 (MATN2) is a protein characterized by a complex domain structure that includes two von Willebrand factor A (vWFA) domains, 10 epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) modules, and a C-terminal coiled-coil oligomerization domain (Mátés2002Comparative; Paulsson2018Matrilins). The vWFA domains are involved in cell adhesion and protein-protein interactions, forming a loop structure through interactions observed via electron microscopy (Paulsson2018Matrilins). The EGF domains contribute to the formation of disulfide bonds, which are crucial for the protein's structural stability (LI2012Distinct). The coiled-coil domain serves as a nucleation site for oligomerization, allowing matrilin-2 to form mono-, di-, tri-, and tetramers (Mátés2002Comparative; LI2012Distinct).

Matrilin-2 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in two variants: a long form with an additional 19 amino acids and a short form. These variants differ in their oligomerization capabilities, with the long form able to self-assemble into various oligomeric forms, while the short form is limited to forming tetramers, trimers, or dimers (LI2012Distinct). The unique domain, located between the second vWFA domain and the coiled-coil domain, is critical for proteolysis and has no sequence homology with other matrilin family members (LI2012Distinct).

## Function
Matrilin-2 (MATN2) is a key component of the extracellular matrix (ECM), where it plays a crucial role in the assembly and stabilization of ECM structures. It interacts with various ECM proteins, including collagens I, II, III, IV, and V, as well as non-collagenous proteins like fibrillin-2, fibronectin, and laminin-1-nidogen-1 complexes. These interactions suggest that matrilin-2 functions as an adapter protein, facilitating the connection of proteoglycans to the collagen network and forming collagen-independent structures (PIECHA2002Matrilin2).

Matrilin-2 is expressed in a wide range of tissues, including connective tissues and subepithelial basement membranes in the skin and digestive tract. It is involved in maintaining the structural integrity of these tissues by contributing to the organization of collagen fibrils and other ECM components (Mátés2002Comparative; PIECHA2002Matrilin2). The protein can form homo-oligomers through its C-terminal coiled-coil region, which is essential for its function in the ECM (PIECHA2002Matrilin2).

In healthy human cells, matrilin-2's ability to bind with high affinity to a range of ECM ligands indicates its involvement in various subcompartments of tissues, such as the skin, where it helps maintain tissue architecture and function (PIECHA2002Matrilin2).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MATN2 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly those involving neuroinflammation and immune regulation. In the context of multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), MATN2 is upregulated in response to axonal injury and contributes to the exacerbation of neuroinflammation. It induces proinflammatory responses in macrophages and microglia through Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways, leading to increased axonal damage and disease severity (Jonas2014Axonally). MATN2's role as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) suggests its involvement in the pathogenesis of neuroinflammatory diseases like MS, where it may exacerbate inflammation and tissue damage (Jonas2014Axonally).

In allergic rhinitis (AR), MATN2 expression is decreased, which affects the differentiation and function of regulatory T-cells (Tregs). This alteration is associated with immune imbalance, as MATN2 promotes Tregs differentiation and cytokine production, counteracting the effects of miR-202-5p, which inhibits these processes (Wang2019MiR2025pMATN2). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of MATN2 in managing immune-related conditions.

## Interactions
Matrilin-2 (MATN2) is an extracellular matrix protein that interacts with a variety of other matrix proteins, playing a significant role in the structural organization of the matrix. It binds to collagen I, fibrillin-2, fibronectin, and laminin-1-nidogen-1 complexes, forming a filamentous network that contributes to tissue integrity (PIECHA2002Matrilin2). MATN2 can also form homotypic filaments through self-interactions, facilitated by its von Willebrand factor A (vWFA)-like domain (PIECHA2002Matrilin2).

MATN2 is involved in both collagen-dependent and collagen-independent filamentous networks, indicating its versatility in interacting with various extracellular matrix components (LI2012Distinct). It can form hetero-oligomers with other matrilins, such as matrilin-1 and matrilin-3, through its heptad repeat coiled-coil domain, which is crucial for oligomerization (LI2012Distinct).

Proteolytic cleavage of MATN2 by ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5 affects its ability to form networks and bind to other matrix proteins, suggesting a role in extracellular matrix degradation (Wang2014Matrilin2). This cleavage is influenced by the presence of other matrilins, altering the proteolytic pattern (Wang2014Matrilin2).
