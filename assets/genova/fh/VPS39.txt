# VPS39

## Overview
VPS39 is a gene that encodes a protein subunit of the homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) complex, which is integral to lysosomal membrane fusion and vesicle trafficking within cells. The VPS39 protein is characterized by domains such as the clathrin heavy chain repeat (CHCR) and citron homology (CNH), which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its role in cellular processes (Dolata2022CP204L). As a component of the HOPS complex, VPS39 is involved in the endo-lysosomal pathway, playing a critical role in the fusion of late endosomes and lysosomes, and is essential for the degradation of endocytosed cargo (Pols2012The). Additionally, VPS39 is implicated in ciliogenesis through its regulation of autophagy, influencing the structure and function of cilia (Iaconis2020The). Its interactions with proteins such as Tom40 and viral proteins like ASFV CP204L further underscore its multifaceted role in cellular homeostasis and response to external factors (González2018Vps39; Dolata2022CP204L). Alterations in VPS39 expression have been associated with renal cystic diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Iaconis2020The).

## Structure
VPS39 is a subunit of the HOPS complex, which plays a crucial role in lysosomal membrane fusion. The protein structure of VPS39 includes several important domains and features that facilitate its function. It contains a clathrin heavy chain repeat (CHCR) domain and a citron homology (CNH) domain, which are involved in protein interactions and are located within a 270-residue region encompassing amino acids 271 to 541 (Dolata2022CP204L). This region also overlaps with a transforming growth factor beta receptor-associated domain and includes an intrinsically disordered region between amino acids 440 and 460 (Dolata2022CP204L).

VPS39 interacts with the small GTPase Ypt7, with the binding site located on the α-solenoid of VPS39, positioned above the membrane (Moeller2023Structure). The protein's structure is characterized by flexibility, particularly in its peripheral portions, which allows for angular re-orientations relative to the core of the HOPS complex (Moeller2023Structure). The C-terminal helices of VPS39 are interlocked with the core subunits through coiled-coil motifs and RING finger domains, contributing to the stability and function of the HOPS complex (Moeller2023Structure).

## Function
VPS39 is a crucial component of the HOPS complex, which plays a significant role in the endo-lysosomal pathway of human cells. It is involved in the fusion of late endosomes and lysosomes, essential for the degradation of endocytosed cargo. VPS39, along with hVps41, localizes to late endosomes and lysosomes, facilitating their fusion and ensuring the proper delivery of endocytic cargo to lysosomal compartments (Pols2012The). Knockdown of VPS39 results in the accumulation of late endosomes and a reduction in lysosomal numbers, impairing the degradation process without affecting lysosomal pH or cathepsin B activity (Pols2012The).

VPS39 also plays a role in ciliogenesis through autophagy. It modulates the localization of ciliary proteins such as IFT20 and OFD1, balancing cilia formation and elongation. VPS39 controls the autophagic degradation of these proteins, influencing cilia structure and function (Iaconis2020The). Overexpression of VPS39 can impair ciliogenesis, while its silencing leads to longer cilia, highlighting its regulatory role in cilia dynamics (Iaconis2020The). These functions underscore VPS39's importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper organelle function.

## Clinical Significance
The VPS39 gene, a component of the HOPS complex, plays a significant role in ciliogenesis through autophagy, particularly in renal cells. Alterations in VPS39 expression have been linked to renal cystic diseases, such as autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Increased expression of VPS39 has been observed in murine models of these diseases, suggesting its involvement in renal function and ciliogenesis (Iaconis2020The). 

VPS39 acts as a negative regulator of ciliogenesis by controlling the localization of the intraflagellar transport 20 (IFT20) protein at the base of cilia. This regulation is crucial for maintaining proper cilia dynamics, and disruptions can lead to impaired ciliogenesis, as seen in renal tubules of medaka fish (Iaconis2020The). Overexpression of VPS39 in these models results in impaired ciliogenesis, which can be partially rescued by autophagy inhibitors, indicating that VPS39 controls ciliogenesis through autophagy both in vitro and in vivo (Iaconis2020The).

These findings suggest that VPS39 could be a potential biological target for addressing cilia-related phenotypes in ciliopathies, including conditions like renal cystic disease (Iaconis2020The).

## Interactions
VPS39 is a subunit of the HOPS complex, which is involved in vesicle trafficking and membrane fusion. It interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular processes. VPS39 specifically interacts with the mitochondrial protein Tom40, a component of the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM) complex. This interaction is essential for the formation of vacuole-mitochondria contact sites (vCLAMPs), which are important for cell survival during starvation (González2018Vps39). The interaction between VPS39 and Tom40 is mediated by a specific region on VPS39, identified between amino acids 480 and 531, which is necessary for mitochondrial association (González2018Vps39).

VPS39 also interacts with the African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV) protein CP204L. This interaction affects VPS39's role in the HOPS complex by preventing its binding to VPS11, leading to lysosome clustering and affecting endosomal trafficking. CP204L binds to a segment of VPS39 that includes a clathrin heavy chain repeat (CHCR) domain, which is crucial for its association with endosomal membranes (Dolata2022CP204L). This interaction highlights the multifunctional role of VPS39 in both cellular and viral contexts.
