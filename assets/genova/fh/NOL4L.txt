# NOL4L

## Overview
NOL4L, or nucleolar protein 4 like, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of cancer biology. The protein encoded by NOL4L is implicated in the regulation of neuroblastoma, a type of cancer that commonly affects children. It functions as an oncogene, promoting cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and glycolysis, which are critical processes in cancer progression. NOL4L interacts with several microRNAs and circular RNAs, forming complex regulatory networks that influence its expression and activity. These interactions are significant in modulating pathways such as the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for neuroblastoma development and progression (Fang2021Circ0132817; Chen2021Silencing; Nie2020LncRNA). Understanding the role of NOL4L in these pathways offers potential therapeutic targets for treating neuroblastoma.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and interactions of the NOL4L gene have been implicated in the progression of neuroblastoma, a common childhood cancer. NOL4L is upregulated in neuroblastoma tissues and cell lines, and its expression is associated with poor prognosis. It acts as an oncogene in neuroblastoma by promoting cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and glycolysis (Fang2021Circ0132817; Chen2021Silencing; Nie2020LncRNA).

The interaction of NOL4L with various microRNAs and circular RNAs plays a significant role in its oncogenic activity. For instance, NOL4L is negatively regulated by miR-29, and its expression is increased when miR-29 is sequestered by the long non-coding RNA DUXAP8, leading to enhanced neuroblastoma progression (Nie2020LncRNA). Similarly, NOL4L is targeted by miR-432-5p, and its expression is modulated by circ_0132817, which acts as a competing endogenous RNA, promoting neuroblastoma cell growth (Fang2021Circ0132817). Additionally, circPDE5A regulates NOL4L expression through miR-362-5p, further contributing to neuroblastoma malignancy (Chen2021Silencing).

These findings suggest that targeting the regulatory axes involving NOL4L could provide therapeutic strategies for neuroblastoma treatment.

## Interactions
NOL4L (nucleolar protein 4 like) is involved in several interactions that influence neuroblastoma progression. It is a target of microRNA-29 (miR-29), which binds to the 3'UTR of NOL4L mRNA, reducing its expression. This interaction is crucial for regulating neuroblastoma cell functions, as the silencing of NOL4L suppresses cell proliferation and metastasis, effects that can be reversed by inhibiting miR-29 (Nie2020LncRNA).

NOL4L is also regulated by miR-432-5p, which directly targets its 3'UTR, leading to decreased NOL4L expression. The circular RNA circ_0132817 acts as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for miR-432-5p, thereby upregulating NOL4L expression. This regulatory network involving circ_0132817, miR-432-5p, and NOL4L is significant in promoting neuroblastoma cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and glycolysis (Fang2021Circ0132817).

Additionally, NOL4L is implicated in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is activated when miR-29 is downregulated by the long non-coding RNA DUXAP8. This pathway activation contributes to neuroblastoma progression by enhancing cell proliferation and metastasis (Nie2020LncRNA).
