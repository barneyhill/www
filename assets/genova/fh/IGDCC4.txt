# IGDCC4

## Overview
IGDCC4, or immunoglobulin superfamily DCC subclass member 4, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in various biological processes, including cell adhesion and signaling. The protein, also known as Nope, is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily and plays a significant role in neuronal development, particularly in axon guidance, by interacting with proteins such as WFIKKN2. Additionally, IGDCC4 is implicated in the internalization of the influenza virus, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for viral infections. The gene's expression is associated with several clinical conditions, including acute myeloid leukemia and osteoarthritis, and it has been linked to developmental pathways affecting birth weight and metabolic programming (Lin2017Developmental; Srivastava2023Genomewide; Nickerson2023WFIKKN2).

## Clinical Significance
The IGDCC4 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in cell adhesion and signaling. Alterations in IGDCC4 expression have been associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), particularly in cases with the IDH2 R140Q mutation. In this context, IGDCC4 is one of the top differentially expressed genes significantly associated with overall survival, suggesting its potential clinical significance in AML (Huang2019Genomescale).

In the realm of infectious diseases, IGDCC4 has been identified as a critical factor in the replication and internalization of the influenza virus. It interacts with viral hemagglutinin, facilitating the virus's entry into host cells. This specific interaction highlights IGDCC4 as a potential target for therapeutic interventions against influenza, as its knockout significantly reduces viral replication (Srivastava2023Genomewide).

IGDCC4 has also been linked to developmental pathways related to adiposity and birth weight. Methylation at specific CpG sites within the IGDCC4 gene is associated with maternal glucose levels and pre-pregnancy BMI, influencing birth weight and potentially contributing to metabolic programming (Lin2017Developmental).

In age-related macular degeneration (AMD), IGDCC4 has been identified as a suggestive variant in genome-wide association studies, although its role in the immune system and AMD remains to be clearly demonstrated (Grunin2024Genome).

## Interactions
IGDCC4, also known as immunoglobulin superfamily DCC subclass member 4, is involved in various interactions with other proteins. It is a transmembrane protein that interacts with the viral hemagglutinin of the influenza virus through its extracellular domain, facilitating the internalization of the virus into host cells. This interaction is specific to influenza viruses, as IGDCC4-deficient cells do not internalize other viruses like Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (Srivastava2023Genomewide).

In the context of neuronal development, IGDCC4, referred to as Nope, interacts with the secreted protein WFIKKN2. This interaction plays a role in axon guidance, where WFIKKN2 acts as a bifunctional cue, mediating repulsion of peripheral sensory axons through Nope and attracting motor axons via other mechanisms. The binding of WFIKKN2 to Nope was confirmed through protein microarray screening and surface plasmon resonance, indicating a specific physical interaction (Nickerson2023WFIKKN2).

IGDCC4 is also implicated in osteoarthritis treatment response, where it is upregulated in patients responding favorably to imrecoxib. This suggests its involvement in pathways such as the Fc epsilon RI signaling pathway, NF-jB signaling pathway, and B-cell receptor signaling pathway (Xie2024Plasma).
