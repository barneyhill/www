# H3-5

## Overview
The H3-5 gene encodes the H3.5 histone, a hominid-specific variant of the histone H3 family, which plays a crucial role in chromatin dynamics and gene regulation. Unlike other histone variants, H3.5 is primarily expressed in the seminiferous tubules of human testes, where it is involved in the organization and remodeling of chromatin during spermatogenesis. The H3.5 protein is characterized by unique amino acid differences that contribute to its reduced nucleosome stability, facilitating rapid histone exchange necessary for dynamic chromatin environments. This instability is attributed to specific residues such as Leu103, which affect hydrophobic interactions within the nucleosome. H3.5 is predominantly associated with euchromatin, indicating its involvement in transcriptionally active regions, and can substitute for H3.3 in certain cellular contexts. The gene's expression and the protein's structural properties have implications in cancer biology, as mutations in H3F3C, the gene encoding H3.5, have been identified in various tumors, suggesting a potential link between H3.5 nucleosome stability and cancer predisposition (Schenk2011H3.5; Urahama2016Histone).

## Structure
The H3.5 histone protein is a hominid-specific variant encoded by the H3F3C gene, located on chromosome 12p11.21. It consists of 134 amino acids and shares approximately 96% identity with the human H3.3 variant (Schenk2011H3.5). Notable differences in its primary structure include the presence of two ARKST motifs adjacent to lysine-9 or lysine-27, a cysteine at position 33, a degenerated motif adjacent to lysine-36, and an asparagine instead of lysine-79 (Schenk2011H3.5). These differences suggest that H3.5 may not undergo methylation at lysine-79, a common post-translational modification in other H3 variants (Schenk2011H3.5).

The H3.5 nucleosome is less stable than those formed by H3.1 and H3.3, attributed to the Leu103 residue, which reduces hydrophobic interactions with histone H4 compared to the Phe104 residue in H3.3 (Urahama2016Histone). This instability is confirmed by salt-titration assays and thermal stability assays (Urahama2016Histone). The crystal structure of the H3.5 nucleosome, determined at 2.8 Å resolution, shows similarity to the H3.3 nucleosome, with the Leu103 residue contributing to its instability (Urahama2016Histone). H3.5 is incorporated into chromatin and predominantly localized in euchromatic regions (Urahama2016Histone).

## Function
The H3.5 histone, encoded by the H3F3C gene, is a hominid-specific variant of histone H3, primarily expressed in the seminiferous tubules of human testes. It plays a significant role in chromatin dynamics, particularly during spermatogenesis. H3.5 is involved in the organization of chromatin around transcription start sites (TSSs) in testicular cells, where it accumulates and may facilitate chromatin reorganization necessary for transcription regulation (Urahama2016Histone).

The H3.5 nucleosome is less stable than other H3 variants, such as H3.3, due to specific amino acid differences, including the presence of leucine at position 103. This instability is thought to aid in the rapid exchange of histones, which is crucial for the dynamic chromatin environment required during the early stages of spermatogenesis (Urahama2016Histone).

H3.5 is predominantly associated with euchromatin, the actively transcribed regions of the genome, and can replace the function of H3.3 in cell growth when H3F3A/H3F3B is depleted. This suggests that H3.5 may have overlapping functions with H3.3, particularly in transcriptionally active regions (Schenk2011H3.5).

## Clinical Significance
The H3-5 gene, encoding the histone variant H3.5, has been implicated in cancer due to its instability and expression patterns. In human testis, the H3.5 nucleosome is less stable than the H3.3 nucleosome, which may be due to specific amino acid residues such as Leu103. This instability is thought to be beneficial for processes like spermatogenesis, where rapid nucleosome turnover is required. However, the same instability may have implications in cancer, as proteins specifically produced in the testis, like H3.5, are sometimes overexpressed in cancer cells. Missense mutations in the H3F3C gene, which encodes H3.5, have been identified in tumors, including mutations at Val100 and Arg130. These mutations may affect nucleosome stability by altering intra-nucleosomal interactions, potentially compromising chromosomal function in tumor cells and suggesting a link between H3.5 nucleosome stability and cancer predisposition (Urahama2016Histone).

While the H3.5 gene is specifically expressed in the seminiferous tubules of human testes, its expression has not been directly associated with specific diseases or conditions outside of cancer. The gene's role in chromatin assembly and its potential to replace H3.3 in cell growth highlight its importance in cellular processes (Schenk2011H3.5).

## Interactions
The H3.5 histone variant, encoded by the H3F3C gene, participates in several interactions that influence chromatin structure and function. H3.5 forms nucleosomes with core histones H2A, H2B, and H4, similar to other H3 variants, but these nucleosomes are less stable due to specific amino acid differences, notably the Leu103 residue, which reduces hydrophobic interactions with H4 (Urahama2016Histone). This instability may facilitate the replacement of histones with transition proteins and protamines during spermatogenesis, a process crucial for chromatin remodeling in testicular cells (Urahama2016Histone).

H3.5 is enriched around transcription start sites in human testis, suggesting a role in marking these sites for chromatin remodeling, independent of gene expression levels (Urahama2016Histone). The variant is incorporated into both active and silent genes, indicating its involvement in preparing chromatin for transcriptional regulation (Urahama2016Histone). Despite these insights, specific interactions of H3.5 with other proteins or nucleic acids outside the nucleosome context are not detailed in the available literature (Urahama2016Histone; Hamiche2012Chaperoning).
