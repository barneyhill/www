# SPC25

## Overview
SPC25 is a gene that encodes a protein component of the NDC80 kinetochore complex, which is crucial for chromosome segregation during mitosis. The SPC25 protein is a structural component that facilitates the attachment of microtubules to kinetochores, ensuring accurate chromosome alignment and segregation, thereby maintaining genomic stability (Kim2015Multiple; Bharadwaj2004Identification). As part of the NDC80 complex, SPC25 interacts with other proteins such as HEC1, SPC24, and NUF2, forming a stable structure essential for kinetochore function (Bharadwaj2004Identification). The protein's role extends to the spindle checkpoint, preventing premature anaphase onset and ensuring proper mitotic progression (Kim2015Multiple). Beyond its fundamental cellular functions, SPC25 is implicated in cancer progression, with its overexpression linked to poor prognosis in various cancers, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Wang2024Pancancer; Liao2024SPC25).

## Function
SPC25 is a critical component of the NDC80 kinetochore complex, which is essential for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. In healthy human cells, SPC25 plays a pivotal role in ensuring accurate kinetochore-microtubule attachments, which are crucial for chromosome alignment and segregation. This function is vital for maintaining genomic stability and preventing aneuploidy (Kim2015Multiple; Bharadwaj2004Identification).

SPC25 interacts with other components of the NDC80 complex, such as HEC1, and localizes to kinetochores during mitosis. This interaction is necessary for the stability and function of the NDC80 complex, which acts as a receptor for spindle microtubules (Kim2015Multiple; Bharadwaj2004Identification). The SPC25 protein is involved in the structural integrity of the kinetochore by facilitating interactions with centromeric chromatin, mediated by proteins like CENP-T (Musacchio2017A; Malvezzi2013A).

Depletion of SPC25 leads to mitotic defects, such as spindle abnormalities and misaligned chromosomes, highlighting its essential role in mitotic progression and cell viability (Bharadwaj2004Identification). SPC25 is also implicated in the spindle checkpoint, ensuring proper mitotic progression and preventing premature anaphase onset (Kim2015Multiple).

## Clinical Significance
The SPC25 gene, a component of the NDC80 kinetochore complex, plays a significant role in various cancers due to its altered expression and interactions. Overexpression of SPC25 is observed in multiple cancer types, including bladder urothelial carcinoma, breast carcinoma, and lung adenocarcinoma, where it is associated with poor prognosis and adverse clinical outcomes (Wang2024Pancancer; Liu2024SPC25). In uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), high SPC25 expression correlates with tumor progression and poor overall survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Liao2024SPC25).

SPC25's expression is linked to immune cell infiltration and immune evasion mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment, impacting the response to immunotherapy (Liao2024SPC25; Xia2024Spindle). Hypomethylation of SPC25 is associated with its overexpression, contributing to reduced immune cell infiltration and worse patient outcomes in cancers like UCEC (Liao2024SPC25). In hepatocellular carcinoma, SPC25 promotes metastasis through the FAK/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, highlighting its role in cancer progression and as a potential therapeutic target (Shi2022SPC25). These findings underscore SPC25's clinical significance as a biomarker for cancer prognosis and a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
SPC25 is a component of the NDC80 kinetochore complex, which plays a critical role in chromosome segregation during mitosis. It interacts with several proteins within this complex, including HEC1, SPC24, and NUF2, forming a stable structure essential for kinetochore-microtubule attachments. The interaction between SPC25 and HEC1 has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, demonstrating that these proteins form a complex throughout the cell cycle (Bharadwaj2004Identification).

SPC25, along with SPC24, forms a heterodimer that interacts with the histone-fold protein Cnn1/CENP-T. This interaction is crucial for linking microtubules to chromosomes, with the conserved Ndc80 receptor motif of Cnn1 binding in a hydrophobic cleft between SPC24 and SPC25 (Malvezzi2013A). Mutations in SPC25 that alter this hydrophobic character can prevent interactions with Cnn1, indicating the specificity and importance of this binding site (Malvezzi2013A).

SPC25 also plays a role in cancer progression, interacting with proteins such as CCND1 and E2F1 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, influencing cell proliferation and metastasis through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Sun2023SPC25). In hepatocellular carcinoma, SPC25 interacts with ITGB4, activating the FAK/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is crucial for tumor metastasis (Shi2022SPC25).
