# IFNL4

## Overview
The IFNL4 gene encodes the protein interferon lambda 4, a member of the type III interferon family, which plays a crucial role in the immune response to viral infections. This cytokine is primarily expressed in epithelial cells and is involved in the activation of the Jak-STAT signaling pathway, leading to the induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that enhance antiviral defenses (Prokunina-Olsson2013A; Hong2016Interferon). Despite its potential antiviral functions, the expression of IFNL4 is often suppressed in humans, possibly due to evolutionary pressures that favor reduced activity of this gene (Hong2016Interferon). The IFNL4 protein shares structural similarities with IFNL3 but exhibits unique interactions with the IFNλ receptor complex, suggesting a distinct or redundant role in immune signaling (Prokunina-Olsson2013A). Variations in the IFNL4 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of hepatitis C virus infections, where certain alleles are associated with differential responses to treatment and viral clearance (TerczyńskaDyla2014Reduced; Amanzada2013Interferonλ4).

## Function
The IFNL4 gene encodes a cytokine that is part of the type III interferon family, which plays a role in modulating immune responses and inflammation. IFNL4 is primarily active in epithelial cells and influences the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), contributing to the body's defense against viral infections. The protein is involved in the activation of the Jak-STAT signaling pathway, which induces ISGs and antiviral activity (Prokunina-Olsson2013A; Hong2016Interferon).

Despite its potential antiviral activity, the expression of IFNL4 is suppressed in humans during viral infections. This suppression is due to mechanisms such as noncoding splice variants, nonfunctional protein isoforms, and a weak polyadenylation signal, which limit its translation and expression (Hong2016Interferon). The IFNL4 protein shares similarities with IFNL3 in its interaction with the primary receptor IFNLR1 but differs in its interaction with the second chain of the receptor complex, IL10R2, suggesting a unique or potentially redundant role in signaling (Prokunina-Olsson2013A).

The role of IFNL4 in healthy human cells is not fully understood, but it is hypothesized to have a cell-autonomous, intracellular role in dampening the antiviral response (Hong2016Interferon). The gene may have arisen from a genetic duplication of IFNL3 without developing a distinct function, leading to its limited contribution compared to other IFNL family members (Hemann2017Interferon).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and variations in the IFNL4 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. The presence of the IFNL4-creating DG allele is associated with higher expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and correlates with higher intrahepatic HCV viral loads, suggesting a role in the immune response to HCV infection (Amanzada2013Interferonλ4). However, the expression of IFNL4 is linked to poor response to interferon-based therapies, as it pre-activates interferon signaling, which can hinder further activation necessary for effective HCV clearance (Prokunina-Olsson2013A).

The rs368234815 TT allele, which results in the pseudogenization of IFNL4, is associated with improved clearance of HCV, both spontaneously and in response to treatment, due to reduced expression of ISGs (TerczyńskaDyla2014Reduced). This allele has been subject to positive selection, particularly in East Asian populations, due to its association with better viral clearance (Key2014Selection).

In addition to HCV, the IFNL4 gene has been implicated in other conditions. For instance, the presence of the IFNL4 rs368234815-ΔG allele is associated with an interferon signature in tumors, which correlates with poor survival outcomes in prostate cancer among African-American men (Tang2018IFNL4ΔG). The gene's pseudogenization is also linked to increased susceptibility to cytomegalovirus retinitis in HIV-infected patients (Key2014Selection).

## Interactions
The IFNL4 protein interacts with the IFNλ receptor complex, which includes the IFNλR1 and IL-10R2 receptor chains. This interaction is crucial for its signaling through the JAK-STAT pathway, leading to the induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) (O’Brien2014IFNλ4:; Hamming2013Interferon). The binding region for the IL-10R2 chain in IFNL4 is distinct compared to other interferons, yet it shares a similar overall structure with IFNL3, allowing it to effectively bind and signal through the receptor complex (O’Brien2014IFNλ4:; Hamming2013Interferon).

Despite its structural similarities to IFNL3, IFNL4 has unique features, such as a glycosylation site at Asn61, which is equivalent to W47 in IFNL1. This site is involved in weak interactions with IFNL1R1, suggesting that IFNL4 can bind to IFNL1R1, albeit weakly (Hamming2013Interferon). IFNL4's interaction with the receptor complex is essential for its antiviral activity, although its poor secretion and retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) can lead to ER stress, affecting antigen presentation and T cell responses (Chen2021Interferon).
