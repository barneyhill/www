# FGB

## Overview
The FGB gene encodes the fibrinogen beta chain, a vital component of the fibrinogen protein complex, which plays a critical role in the blood coagulation process. Fibrinogen is a hexameric glycoprotein composed of three pairs of polypeptide chains: alpha (Aα), beta (Bβ), and gamma (γ), with the beta chain being encoded by the FGB gene. This gene is located on chromosome 4 and is essential for the synthesis and structural integrity of fibrinogen, which is primarily produced in the liver and secreted into the bloodstream. The fibrinogen beta chain is involved in the formation of fibrin, a key protein in blood clot formation, by interacting with thrombin and other fibrinogen chains to stabilize clots and support hemostasis (Sulimai2022Fibrinogen; NeermanArbez2006Molecular). Mutations in the FGB gene can lead to various bleeding disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining normal coagulation and hemostatic balance (Castaman2019Risk; Simurda2020A).

## Structure
The FGB gene encodes the fibrinogen beta chain, a crucial component of the fibrinogen molecule, which is a hexameric plasmatic glycoprotein involved in blood clotting. The primary structure of the fibrinogen beta chain consists of a specific sequence of amino acids encoded by the FGB gene located on chromosome 4, spanning an 8kb region with eight exons (Simurda2020Genetic). The secondary structure of the beta chain includes alpha helices and beta sheets, with specific mutations affecting these structures. For instance, the p.Trp474Ter mutation results in the loss of three β sheet arrangements, impacting the protein's stability and function (Simurda2020A).

The tertiary structure of the fibrinogen beta chain contributes to its globular shape, which is essential for its role in forming the fibrinogen molecule. The quaternary structure involves the association of the beta chain with the alpha and gamma chains, forming a hexameric structure held together by disulfide bridges (Simurda2020Genetic). The beta chain, along with the gamma chain, forms the C-terminal portions of the D regions, which are similar in structure (Simurda2020Genetic).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are significant for the function and stability of the fibrinogen beta chain. These modifications can influence the protein's folding and secretion, as seen in certain mutations that lead to congenital fibrinogen disorders (Simurda2020Genetic).

## Function
The FGB gene encodes the fibrinogen Bβ chain, a crucial component of the fibrinogen hexamer, which is essential for blood clotting. In healthy human cells, the Bβ chain, along with the Aα and γ chains, forms a hexameric structure that is vital for the coagulation process. Fibrinogen is synthesized predominantly in hepatocytes and is secreted into the bloodstream, where it plays a key role in hemostasis by supporting platelet aggregation and stabilizing blood clots (Zhang2019Phenotypic; NeermanArbez2006Molecular).

The Bβ chain is part of the D domains of the fibrinogen structure, which are essential for the protein's function in blood clotting. The synthesis of fibrinogen is regulated at the transcriptional level, ensuring coordinated production of the chains in response to physiological stimuli such as inflammation or injury (NeermanArbez2006Molecular). The C-terminal domain of the Bβ chain is particularly important for the secretion of fibrinogen, as it helps maintain the three-dimensional structure necessary for its secretion into the bloodstream (NeermanArbez2006Molecular). This domain prevents the exposure of hydrophobic residues, which is crucial for the proper secretion and function of fibrinogen (ASSELTA2006The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FGB gene, which encodes the beta chain of fibrinogen, are associated with several bleeding disorders, including afibrinogenemia and hypofibrinogenemia. Afibrinogenemia is characterized by the complete absence of fibrinogen, often due to null mutations such as large deletions, frameshift, or nonsense mutations in the FGB gene (VU2007Molecular). Hypofibrinogenemia, on the other hand, results from low levels of fibrinogen and can be caused by missense mutations in the FGB gene, such as the novel nonsense mutation c.1421G>A, which leads to a premature stop codon and is associated with bleeding disorders (Simurda2020A).

Certain mutations in the FGB gene can also lead to dysfibrinogenemia, a condition where abnormal fibrinogen molecules result in bleeding or thrombotic events. For instance, the FGB Arg44Cys mutation has been linked to venous thromboembolism, while the Ter492Gln mutation is associated with bleeding disorders (Castaman2019Risk). These mutations can impair fibrinogen secretion and assembly, affecting normal clot formation and leading to clinical manifestations such as bleeding during surgery or pregnancy complications (Simurda2020A).

## Interactions
The fibrinogen beta chain (FGB) is a crucial component of the fibrinogen protein, which plays a significant role in blood clotting. FGB interacts with the other fibrinogen chains, Aα and γ, to form a stable hexameric structure essential for its function in hemostasis (Sulimai2022Fibrinogen). This assembly process involves the integration of the Bβ chain into a pre-formed αγ complex, facilitated by chaperone proteins such as Calnexin and calreticulin, which assist in protein folding and disulfide bond formation (Sulimai2022Fibrinogen).

Mutations in the FGB gene can disrupt these interactions, leading to altered fibrinogen assembly and secretion. For instance, certain mutations in the FGB gene result in truncated proteins or affect the secretion of fibrinogen, contributing to conditions like afibrinogenemia and hypofibrinogenemia (Simurda2017Identification). These mutations can impair the structural integrity of fibrinogen, affecting its ability to interact with other proteins during the clotting process (Simurda2017Identification).

FGB also interacts with thrombin, which converts fibrinogen to fibrin, forming a fibrin network essential for clot formation. This interaction is critical for the protein's role in coagulation and maintaining hemostatic balance.
