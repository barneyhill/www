# HAPLN2

## Overview
HAPLN2 is a gene that encodes the protein hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 2, which is a crucial component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the central nervous system. This protein is characterized by its immunoglobulin-like fold and proteoglycan tandem repeat domains, which facilitate its role in stabilizing the binding of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans to hyaluronan, thereby maintaining ECM integrity (Wang2016Elevated; Wang2019Hapln2). HAPLN2 is predominantly expressed in the brain, where it is involved in the formation of ECM structures at the nodes of Ranvier, essential for neuronal conductivity and action potential propagation (Wang2019Hapln2). The protein's interactions with other ECM components and nodal proteins underscore its significance in neural function and its potential involvement in neurological disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases (Wang2016Elevated; Wang2019Hapln2).

## Structure
HAPLN2, or hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 2, is a protein encoded by the HAPLN2 gene. The primary structure of HAPLN2 consists of 340 amino acids, featuring one immunoglobulin-like fold and two proteoglycan tandem repeat (PTR) domains (Wang2016Elevated). The estimated molecular mass of the polypeptide is approximately 38 kDa, although Western blotting has shown bands of around 55 kDa in transfected cell lysates and approximately 48 kDa in substantia nigra tissue lysates from adult rats, likely due to hyaluronic acid modifications (Wang2016Elevated; Wang2019Hapln2).

The secondary structure of HAPLN2 includes an immunoglobulin-like fold, which is a common feature in proteins involved in cell adhesion and immune response (Wang2019Hapln2). The tertiary structure is characterized by a globular domain, typical of proteins that interact with other macromolecules in the extracellular matrix. HAPLN2 is part of a family of proteins that includes Hapln1, Hapln3, and Hapln4, with Hapln2 and Hapln4 being specifically expressed in the brain (Wang2019Hapln2).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, may occur, contributing to the protein's functional diversity. However, specific details on quaternary structure, prominent folds, or splice variant isoforms are not provided in the available context.

## Function
HAPLN2, also known as hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 2, is primarily expressed in the central nervous system, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the extracellular matrix (ECM) (Wang2019Hapln2). It stabilizes the binding of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans to hyaluronan, which is essential for ECM formation and function, particularly in the brain (Wang2019Hapln2). HAPLN2 is involved in the stabilization of ECM components such as brevican and aggrecan, contributing to the density of aggrecan aggregates and ECM stability (Wang2019Hapln2).

In healthy human cells, HAPLN2 is expressed in myelinated fiber tracts and is co-localized with versican at the nodes of Ranvier, which are critical for saltatory conduction and neuronal conductivity (Wang2016Elevated). The protein's expression begins around 20 days after birth in mice, coinciding with axonal myelination, and increases with age, indicating its role in maintaining neuronal conductivity and ECM stability (Wang2016Elevated; Wang2019Hapln2). HAPLN2's interaction with nodal protein NF186 affects action potential propagation, highlighting its importance in neuronal function (Wang2019Hapln2).

## Clinical Significance
HAPLN2 is implicated in several neurological diseases, primarily due to its role in protein aggregation and neurodegeneration. In Parkinson's Disease (PD), elevated expression of HAPLN2 is observed in the substantia nigra, a region critically affected in PD. This upregulation is associated with the aggregation of α-synuclein, a key protein in PD pathology, and the formation of Lewy bodies, which are characteristic of the disease. HAPLN2 aggregates are linked to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, suggesting a mechanism by which it contributes to neurodegeneration in PD (Wang2016Elevated).

In Alzheimer's Disease (AD), HAPLN2 has been identified in neurofibrillary tangles, although its precise role remains unclear. Its involvement in the extracellular matrix and potential impact on hippocampal neurogenesis suggest a possible contribution to AD pathology (Wang2019Hapln2). Additionally, HAPLN2 expression changes have been noted in schizophrenia, with lower levels observed in the anterior temporal lobes of affected individuals (Wang2019Hapln2).

HAPLN2's role in maintaining neuronal conductivity and extracellular matrix integrity further implicates it in neurological disorders, where its altered expression or interactions may disrupt normal brain function (Wang2019Hapln2).

## Interactions
HAPLN2, also known as hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 2, is involved in several interactions within the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the brain. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing the binding between brain lecticans, such as brevican and aggrecan, and hyaluronan, which are major components of the ECM. HAPLN2 colocalizes with versican at myelinated retinal ganglion cell axons and nodes of Ranvier in the adult mouse brain, indicating its involvement in nodal ECM formation (Wang2019Hapln2). 

HAPLN2 interacts with the nodal protein neurofascin-186 (NF186), which is responsible for action potential propagation. This interaction was confirmed using a pull-down method, suggesting HAPLN2's important role in action potential propagation (Wang2019Hapln2). In the context of neurological diseases, HAPLN2 has been shown to colocalize with α-synuclein aggregates, suggesting it may be a component of Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease (PD) (Wang2019Hapln2). 

The protein's interactions are significant in maintaining the ECM's structural integrity and influencing neuronal conductivity by affecting extracellular diffusion barriers at the nodes of Ranvier (Wang2019Hapln2).
