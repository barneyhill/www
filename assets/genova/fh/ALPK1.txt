# ALPK1

## Overview
The ALPK1 gene encodes the protein alpha kinase 1, a member of the alpha kinase family, which is distinguished by its ability to phosphorylate substrates in an alpha-helical conformation. Alpha kinase 1 is a serine/threonine kinase involved in various cellular processes, including epithelial cell polarity, apical protein transport, and innate immune responses. It plays a critical role in the phosphorylation of myosin I and myosin IIA, facilitating vesicle transport and TNF-α trafficking, respectively, which are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to inflammatory stimuli (Lee2016ALPK1; Heine2005αKinase). The protein is also implicated in the recognition of bacterial components, activating inflammatory pathways through interactions with proteins such as TIFA, thereby contributing to the host immune response (GarcíaWeber2023In; GarcíaWeber2020ADPheptose:). Mutations in ALPK1 have been associated with various diseases, including ROSAH syndrome, gout, and certain cancers, underscoring its clinical significance in inflammatory and metabolic disorders (Ko2022Systematic; Williams2019ALPK1).

## Structure
The ALPK1 protein is a member of the alpha kinase family, characterized by its unique ability to recognize the alpha-helical conformation as a phosphorylation site. The protein is composed of 1244 amino acids and includes several key structural regions. The N-terminal region contains amphipathic helices, which are predicted to be involved in vesicular transport and curvature fusion sensing (Ko2022Systematic; Lee2016ALPK1). This region is also conserved across multiple species, including humans, chimpanzees, and mice (Lee2016ALPK1).

The C-terminal region of ALPK1 contains an alpha-kinase catalytic domain, which is homologous to the myosin heavy chain kinases of Dictyostelium discoideum (GarcíaWeber2023In). This domain is crucial for the protein's kinase activity, including the phosphorylation of myosin IIA, which plays a role in TNF-α trafficking during inflammatory responses (Lee2016ALPK1). The kinase domain acts as a dynamic molecular switch, requiring ATP for activation (Lee2016ALPK1).

ALPK1 is also involved in the phosphorylation of TIFA, a process that is essential for TIFAsome formation and NF-κB activation (GarcíaWeber2023In). The protein's structure and function are influenced by specific mutations, such as T237M and V1092A, which alter its kinase activity and are associated with inflammatory disorders and cancers (GarcíaWeber2023In).

## Function
ALPK1 (alpha kinase 1) is a serine/threonine kinase involved in several cellular processes, particularly in epithelial cell polarity and apical protein transport. In polarized epithelial cells, ALPK1 is associated with the apical post-Golgi transport carriers, specifically in sucrase-isomaltase vesicles (SAVs) from MDCK cells. It plays a crucial role in the phosphorylation of myosin I, a motor protein that facilitates vesicle transport along the secretory pathway, which is essential for the apical trafficking of sucrase-isomaltase (Heine2005αKinase). This phosphorylation activity is sensitive to calcium and calmodulin, indicating a non-conventional kinase activity (Heine2005αKinase).

ALPK1 is also involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating cellular responses to stress. It is active in the cytoplasm and plays a role in innate immunity by recognizing bacterial components and activating inflammatory pathways (GarcíaWeber2023In). The kinase is implicated in the regulation of the TIFA/TRAF6 pathway, which is essential for the production of inflammatory cytokines, highlighting its role in orchestrating the initial host immune response and limiting bacterial dissemination within infected tissues (Milivojevic2017ALPK1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ALPK1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. One notable condition is ROSAH syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by retinal dystrophy, optic nerve edema, splenomegaly, anhidrosis, and migraine headaches. The p.Thr237Met mutation in ALPK1 is commonly associated with this syndrome, leading to chronic activation of the gene and resulting in autoinflammatory symptoms (Kozycki2022Gainoffunction; Snelling2024Discovery; Williams2019ALPK1).

ALPK1 is also linked to inflammatory and metabolic disorders. Variants such as rs2074388 (G565D) and rs2074379 (M732I) are associated with gout, chronic kidney disease, and type 2 diabetes. These variants affect serum creatinine, uric acid, and glucose levels, contributing to disease pathogenesis (Ko2022Systematic; YAMADA2015Association). In gout, ALPK1 overexpression is associated with increased inflammatory cytokine production, mediated through pathways like ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK (Wang2011Lymphocyte).

In cancer, ALPK1 mutations such as V1092A can activate NF-κB signaling, contributing to cancer progression and inflammation, particularly in lung, colorectal, and oral cancers (Ko2022Systematic; GarcíaWeber2023Ina). These findings highlight ALPK1's role in various inflammatory, metabolic, and neoplastic conditions.

## Interactions
ALPK1 (alpha kinase 1) is involved in several protein interactions that play crucial roles in cellular processes, particularly in immune response and inflammation. ALPK1 interacts with myosin IIA, F-actin, and calmodulin, forming a complex that is essential for the trafficking of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, especially during gout flares. This interaction involves the phosphorylation of myosin IIA, which is enhanced by the presence of monosodium urate crystals, a condition associated with gout (Lee2016ALPK1).

ALPK1 also plays a significant role in the innate immune response by interacting with the adaptor protein TIFA. Upon recognition of the bacterial metabolite ADP-heptose, ALPK1 phosphorylates TIFA, leading to TIFA oligomerization and subsequent activation of TRAF6, which is crucial for NF-κB pathway activation. This interaction is part of the ALPK1/TIFA/TRAF6 axis, which controls inflammation following bacterial heptose recognition (GarcíaWeber2020ADPheptose:).

In the context of bacterial infections, ALPK1 is involved in the formation of TIFAsomes, large multiprotein complexes that form in response to ADP-heptose sensing. These interactions are transient, with ALPK1 not remaining stably associated with TIFAsomes (GarcíaWeber2020ADPheptose:).
