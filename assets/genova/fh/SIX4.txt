# SIX4

## Overview
SIX4, or SIX homeobox 4, is a gene that encodes a transcription factor involved in the regulation of gene expression, particularly during muscle development and differentiation. The protein product, SIX homeobox 4, is categorized as a transcription factor and plays a pivotal role in myogenic conversion by interacting with other key transcription factors such as MyoD. This interaction is essential for the activation of myogenic markers necessary for muscle development (Chakroun2015Genome‐wide). SIX4 is also implicated in various cellular processes, including ion transport and cellular homeostasis, by binding to specific DNA sequences (Kawakami2000Six). Beyond its role in normal physiological processes, SIX4 has been associated with the progression of several cancers, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer, where it influences tumor growth and metastasis (Camolotto2019Reciprocal; Liu2016The). The gene's involvement in both developmental and pathological contexts underscores its significance as a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

## Function
SIX4 (SIX homeobox 4) is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in regulating gene expression during muscle development and differentiation. In healthy human cells, SIX4 is involved in myogenic conversion by interacting with MyoD, a key transcription factor in muscle differentiation. This interaction is crucial for the expression of myogenic markers such as Myog and MHC, which are essential for muscle development (Chakroun2015Genome‐wide). SIX4 binds to specific DNA sequences, including the ARE, a transcription regulatory element of the Na,K-ATPase a1 subunit gene (Atp1a1), indicating its role in regulating genes involved in ion transport and cellular homeostasis (Kawakami2000Six).

SIX4 is active in the nucleus, where it binds to proximal promoters enriched with H3K4me3, a mark associated with gene activation, and regulates the expression of genes involved in muscle development, transcription regulation, and cell proliferation (Chakroun2015Genome‐wide). It also recruits the histone demethylase Utx to remove repressive chromatin marks, facilitating the transcriptional activation of muscle genes during differentiation (chakroun2016functional). Through these molecular processes, SIX4 contributes to proper muscle regeneration and development.

## Clinical Significance
The SIX4 gene has been implicated in various cancers, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In PDAC, particularly the HNF4α-negative subtype, SIX4 is highly expressed and plays a crucial role in tumor proliferation and growth. The loss of SIX4 in PDAC cell lines has been shown to reduce growth rates, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target in this aggressive cancer subtype (Camolotto2019Reciprocal). SIX4 expression is also associated with the Basal-like subtype of PDAC, which is characterized by aggressive tumor growth (Camolotto2019Reciprocal).

In NSCLC, higher expression levels of SIX4 are linked to poor overall survival and recurrence-free survival. SIX4 is significantly overexpressed in NSCLC tissues compared to normal tissues and is associated with advanced TNM stages and lymph node metastasis. These findings suggest that SIX4 could serve as a biomarker for prognosis and disease progression in NSCLC (Liu2016The).

Alterations in SIX4 expression and its interactions with other genes, such as HNF4α, highlight its role in cancer pathogenesis and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention (Camolotto2019Reciprocal).

## Interactions
SIX4, a transcription factor, engages in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. In ovarian cancer, SIX4 interacts with insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3), which stabilizes SIX4 mRNA, enhancing its expression and promoting malignant phenotypes in cancer cells. This interaction suggests that IGF2BP3 may facilitate the local translation of SIX4, contributing to tumor progression (Han2022IGF2BP3‑stabilized).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SIX4 interacts with YAP1 and c-MET, enhancing the migratory and invasive abilities of cancer cells. SIX4 directly binds to the promoters of YAP1 and MET, upregulating their expression and activating downstream signaling pathways such as ERK1/2, JNK, p38, AKT, and NF-κB. This interaction is crucial for HCC metastasis and proliferation (He2020SIX4).

During myogenesis, SIX4 cooperates with MyoD, a master regulator of muscle differentiation. SIX4 recruits the histone demethylase Utx to MyoD target loci, facilitating the transcriptional activation of muscle-specific genes. This interaction is essential for the expression of a large set of genes during muscle differentiation and regeneration (Chakroun2015Genome‐wide).
