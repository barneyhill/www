# STAC2

## Overview
STAC2 is a gene that encodes the protein SH3 and cysteine-rich domain 2, which is a member of the STAC protein family. This protein is characterized by its SH3 domain, a common protein interaction module, and a unique polyproline region at its N-terminus. Unlike other STAC proteins, STAC2 lacks a second SH3 domain, distinguishing it from its family member STAC3. The protein is involved in modulating L-type calcium channels, playing a crucial role in calcium-dependent inactivation (CDI) and influencing various signaling pathways. STAC2 is expressed in nonexcitable cells, suggesting its regulatory functions extend beyond muscle excitation-contraction coupling. It also interacts with the RANK signaling complex, negatively regulating osteoclast formation, and is differentially expressed in breast cancer tissues (Campiglio2017STAC3; Rufenach2021Structure).

## Structure
STAC2 is a protein characterized by its SH3 domain, which is a common protein interaction module that binds proline-rich segments. The SH3 domain is composed of a five-stranded antiparallel beta sheet, contributing to its ability to mediate protein-protein interactions (Rufenach2021Structure). STAC2 also features a polyproline region at its N-terminus, which is distinct from other STAC proteins (Campiglio2017STAC3). The protein lacks a second SH3 domain, which differentiates it from STAC3, another member of the STAC protein family (Campiglio2017STAC3).

The C1 domain of STAC2 is a lipid-binding module involved in protein-protein interactions, although specific structural details of STAC2's C1 domain are not provided in the context (Rufenach2021Structure). The electrostatic potential profiles of the C1 domains differ among STAC isoforms, with STAC2 having unique properties compared to STAC3 (Rufenach2021Structure).

STAC2 is involved in various signaling pathways and is expressed in nonexcitable cells, with its regulatory functions extending beyond muscle excitation-contraction coupling (Rufenach2021Structure). The presence of splice variant isoforms may contribute to the functional diversity of STAC2, although specific variants are not detailed in the context.

## Function
STAC2 is a member of the STAC protein family, which plays a role in modulating L-type calcium channels, crucial for muscle excitation-contraction coupling. It is involved in the regulation of calcium-dependent inactivation (CDI) of these channels, although it shows poor colocalization with CaV1.2 compared to other STAC isoforms like STAC3 (Rufenach2021Structure). STAC2 is expressed in nonexcitable cells, suggesting broader regulatory roles beyond muscle and neuronal tissues. It interferes with the RANK signaling complex to negatively regulate osteoclast formation and is differentially expressed in breast cancer tissues, where it is abundantly expressed (Rufenach2021Structure).

The protein contains SH3 domains, which are not required for CDI regulation, but a 22-residue 'U-motif' within the disordered linker region is critical for suppressing CDI (Rufenach2021Structure). Knockout studies in mice indicate that STAC2 is homozygous viable with no significant phenotypes, suggesting potential compensatory mechanisms by other STAC isoforms (Rufenach2021Structure). The specific function of STAC2 in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated, but its involvement in various calcium signaling processes is evident (Rufenach2021Structure).

## Interactions
STAC2 is known to interact with L-type calcium channels, particularly influencing calcium-dependent inactivation (CDI) in channels such as CaV1.2, CaV1.3, and CaV1.4. This interaction is mediated through multiple regions of the calcium channel's carboxy-tail, with the IQ motif being a significant site for binding. The SH3 domains of STAC2 are not required for CDI regulation; instead, a disordered linker region between the C1 and SH3 domains, particularly a 22-residue 'U-motif,' is crucial for CDI suppression (Rufenach2021Structure). 

STAC2 also interacts with the cytoplasmic linker between repeats II and III of the CaV1.1 channel, which is essential for excitation-contraction coupling in muscle cells. This interaction involves the SH3 domains of STAC2, with W329 being crucial for binding. The first SH3 domain is the main contributor, but the second SH3 domain also plays a role through water-mediated hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions (Rufenach2021Structure).

STAC2 is implicated in various signaling pathways beyond its role in modulating ion channels. It interferes with the RANK signaling complex, negatively regulating osteoclast formation, and is identified as a differentially expressed gene in breast cancer studies (Rufenach2021Structure).
