# DNAH9

## Overview
DNAH9 is a gene that encodes the protein dynein axonemal heavy chain 9, which is a crucial component of the outer dynein arms (ODAs) in motile cilia and flagella. This protein is categorized as a motor protein, playing a significant role in the motility of cilia and flagella by generating the mechanical forces necessary for their movement. In human respiratory cilia, DNAH9 is specifically localized to the distal two-thirds, contributing to the ciliary beat frequency and pattern, while in sperm cells, it spans the entire axoneme, indicating its role in sperm motility (Fliegauf2005Mislocalization). Mutations in DNAH9 are linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and nonsyndromic severe asthenozoospermia, highlighting its importance in respiratory function and fertility (Fassad2018Mutations; Tang2021Novel).

## Function
DNAH9 encodes a dynein heavy chain protein that is a critical component of the outer dynein arms (ODAs) in cilia and flagella, which are essential for their motility. In healthy human respiratory cilia, DNAH9 is specifically localized to the distal two-thirds of the cilia, indicating its role in the distal ODA complexes. These complexes are distinct from the proximal ODA complexes, which are DNAH9 negative and DNAH5 positive (Fliegauf2005Mislocalization). DNAH9's primary function is related to the motility of the distal part of the cilia, contributing to the ciliary beat frequency and pattern (Fliegauf2005Mislocalization).

In sperm cells, DNAH9 localizes along the entire length of the sperm axoneme, suggesting a role in sperm motility (Fliegauf2005Mislocalization). The spatial distribution of DNAH9 varies between respiratory cilia and sperm axonemes, which may contribute to the distinct beating characteristics of these structures (Fliegauf2005Mislocalization). DNAH9 is part of type two outer dynein arms, which are essential for the movement of cilia and flagella (Yildirim2022Dynein). The protein's activity is crucial for generating the energy required for the bending of cilia and flagella, facilitating processes like respiratory function and sperm motility (Fliegauf2005Mislocalization).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DNAH9 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting ciliary function. One of the main conditions linked to DNAH9 mutations is primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a disorder characterized by defects in motile cilia leading to chronic respiratory issues, laterality defects such as situs inversus, and subfertility (Fassad2018Mutations). These mutations result in the loss or reduction of outer dynein arms (ODAs) in the distal axoneme of cilia, impairing ciliary motility and leading to respiratory symptoms and laterality defects (Fassad2018Mutations).

In addition to PCD, DNAH9 mutations have been implicated in nonsyndromic severe asthenozoospermia, a condition characterized by extremely low sperm motility, which is a significant cause of male infertility. Unlike PCD, individuals with this condition do not exhibit typical respiratory symptoms (Tang2021Novel). The mutations in DNAH9 can also lead to subtle respiratory ciliary-beating defects and laterality defects, such as situs inversus totalis and complex congenital heart defects, without the full spectrum of PCD symptoms (Loges2018Recessive). These findings highlight the diverse clinical manifestations associated with DNAH9 mutations, emphasizing the gene's critical role in ciliary function.

## Interactions
DNAH9, a component of the outer dynein arms (ODAs) in motile cilia, interacts with several proteins crucial for ciliary function. It is known to interact with CCDC114, a component of the ODA docking complex. This interaction has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, indicating a physical association between DNAH9 and CCDC114 (Loges2018Recessive). DNAH9 also interacts with GAS8, a component of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC). The absence of DNAH9 leads to a significant reduction in the expression of both CCDC114 and GAS8, suggesting that DNAH9 is essential for the structural integrity of these complexes (Zheng2022Dnah9).

In addition to these interactions, DNAH9 is involved in the assembly of ODA type 2, where it interacts with other ODA components such as DNAH5 and DNAI2. These interactions are crucial for the proper assembly and function of the distal axonemal compartment in cilia (Loges2018Recessive). The absence of DNAH9 disrupts the localization and function of these proteins, leading to defects in ciliary motility and structure (Fassad2018Mutations).
