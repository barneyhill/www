# REPS2

## Overview
The REPS2 gene encodes the protein RALBP1 associated Eps domain containing 2, which is involved in the regulation of endocytosis and growth factor receptor signaling. This protein, categorized as a molecular scaffold, plays a significant role in cellular signaling pathways by facilitating interactions with various proteins involved in vesicular trafficking and cytoskeletal remodeling. The REPS2 protein is expressed in two isoforms, both of which contain an amino-terminal EH (Eps15 homology) domain, a central proline-rich region, and a carboxy-terminal portion that binds to RalBP1. These structural features enable REPS2 to interact with proteins such as Eps15, epsin, and Grb2, which are crucial for the internalization and signaling of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (Corallino2011REPS2; Tomassi2008The). The protein's interactions and regulatory functions are essential for maintaining normal cellular homeostasis and have implications in various cancers, where alterations in REPS2 expression can influence disease progression and patient prognosis (Oosterhoff2004EGF; Doolan2009TMEM25).

## Structure
The REPS2 gene encodes a protein expressed in two isoforms: a short isoform of 521 amino acids and a longer isoform with an additional 139 amino acids at the amino-terminus, totaling 660 residues (Corallino2011REPS2; Tomassi2008The). Both isoforms share structural features, including an amino-terminal EH (Eps15 homology) domain, a central region with two proline-rich regions, and a carboxy-terminal portion that binds to RalBP1 (Corallino2011REPS2; Tomassi2008The).

The EH domain, located between residues 127-226, is involved in receptor endocytosis and apoptosis, interacting with proteins such as epsin, Eps15, and NF-kappaB p65 (Corallino2011REPS2; Tomassi2008The). The central proline-rich region, spanning residues 308-398, plays a regulatory role in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) endocytosis by binding to 14-3-3 and SH3 domain-containing proteins like Grb2 and Amphiphysin II (Tomassi2008The). The carboxy-terminal region binds to PAG2 and influences paxillin localization in focal adhesion (Corallino2011REPS2).

Post-translational modifications include phosphorylation at specific serine residues, such as Ser354, which is crucial for 14-3-3 protein binding (Tomassi2008The). These structural features and modifications are essential for the protein's role in endocytosis and growth factor signaling regulation.

## Function
The REPS2 gene encodes a protein involved in the regulation of endocytosis and growth factor receptor signaling in healthy human cells. It plays a crucial role in the internalization and signaling of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor by interacting with proteins such as Eps15, epsin, and Grb2, which are involved in clathrin-coated pits (Corallino2011REPS2; Oosterhoff2004EGF). The protein structure of REPS2 includes an amino-terminal EH domain, a central region with proline-rich areas, and a carboxy-terminal portion that binds to RalBP1, facilitating its role in receptor endocytosis (Corallino2011REPS2).

REPS2 functions as a molecular scaffold, recruiting proteins involved in vesicular traffic and linking them to the actin cytoskeleton remodeling machinery (Tomassi2008The). It interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, Grb2, and amphiphysin II, which are crucial for the receptor down-regulation machinery (Corallino2011REPS2). The binding of 14-3-3 proteins to REPS2 is phosphorylation-dependent, highlighting its regulatory role in endocytosis and cell signaling (Tomassi2008The). In healthy cells, REPS2's regulation of EGF receptor endocytosis is essential for maintaining normal growth factor signaling and cellular homeostasis (Oosterhoff2004EGF).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the REPS2 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including prostate and breast cancer. In prostate cancer, high levels of REPS2 expression are associated with reduced epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor internalization and signaling, suggesting that REPS2 acts as an inhibitor of EGF signaling. This inhibition is crucial as prostate cancer progresses from an androgen-dependent to an androgen-independent state, where increased EGF signaling is observed. The loss of REPS2 expression during this progression may enhance EGF receptor signaling, contributing to the androgen-independent growth of advanced prostate cancer (Oosterhoff2004EGF).

In breast cancer, REPS2 expression is linked to favorable overall survival and relapse-free survival, particularly in patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. The gene is expressed in a significant portion of breast tumors but is generally absent in triple-negative breast tumors, which are associated with poorer outcomes. This suggests that REPS2 could serve as a prognostic and predictive biomarker for breast cancer, helping to identify patients who may benefit from specific treatments (Doolan2009TMEM25).

Additionally, REPS2 has been identified as a hub gene in glioma, where its high expression is associated with better overall and disease-free survival, indicating its potential role as a prognostic biomarker in this context as well (Wen2020Identification).

## Interactions
REPS2, also known as POB1, is involved in various protein interactions that play a crucial role in cellular signaling and endocytosis. It interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) through its central proline-rich domain, which binds to SH3 domain-containing proteins such as Grb2 and Amphiphysin II. These interactions are essential for EGFR endocytosis and are confirmed by experiments like GST pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation (Tomassi2008The).

REPS2 also interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, with binding dependent on the phosphorylation of Ser354. This interaction is significant for protein membrane trafficking and is conserved in mouse orthologs and human REPS1 (Tomassi2008The). The EH domain of REPS2 binds to the NF-κB subunit p65, influencing NF-κB activity, which is relevant in prostate cancer progression (Penninkhof2004Identification).

REPS2 forms complexes with proteins involved in endocytosis, such as RalBP1, Eps15, and Epsin, which are crucial for the assembly of clathrin-coated pits necessary for endocytosis. This interaction network is stable and not influenced by EGF addition (Oosterhoff2004EGF; Tomassi2008The). These interactions highlight REPS2's role as a molecular scaffold in cellular signaling pathways.
