# TOMM5

## Overview
TOMM5 is a gene that encodes the translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 5, a protein that is part of the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM) complex. This complex is essential for the import of proteins into mitochondria, serving as the primary entry point for mitochondrial proteins. The TOMM5 protein contributes to the structural integrity and function of the TOM complex by assisting in signal recognition, complex stabilization, and assembly, particularly in its dimeric form (Bogorodskiy2021Role). Although TOMM5 is not essential for the basic functions of the TOM complex, it plays a supportive role in maintaining the stability and assembly of the complex, alongside other small TOM proteins such as TOMM6 and TOMM7 (Zhao2021Role). The gene's involvement in mitochondrial dynamics and its upregulation under certain conditions, such as treatment with moringin, highlight its role in cellular responses and mitochondrial function (Chiricosta2019Moringin).

## Structure


## Function
TOMM5 is a component of the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM) complex, which is essential for the import of proteins into mitochondria. The TOM complex serves as the main entry gate for mitochondrial proteins, and TOMM5 plays a role in the structural integrity and function of this complex. It assists in signal recognition, complex stabilization, and assembly, particularly in the dimeric form of the TOM complex, where it surrounds TOMM40 and helps stabilize the complex (Bogorodskiy2021Role). 

TOMM5, along with other small TOM proteins like TOMM6 and TOMM7, is involved in the assembly and stability of the TOM complex, although it is not essential for its basic functions (Zhao2021Role). The TOM complex, including TOMM5, is crucial for the import of precursor proteins into mitochondria, which is vital for mitochondrial function and cellular energy production (Bogorodskiy2021Role). 

In the context of mitochondrial dynamics, TOMM5 is upregulated in certain conditions, such as in human periodontal ligament stem cells treated with moringin, indicating its involvement in mitochondrial function and response to cellular stimuli (Chiricosta2019Moringin).

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the TOMM5 gene is not extensively detailed in the available literature. However, some associations with cardiovascular conditions have been noted. An intronic variant of the TOMM5 gene is linked to increased lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 activity, which is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular events (Zhao2021Role). In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TOMM5 is included in a prognostic model involving mitophagy-related genes. Although the specific clinical significance of TOMM5 in HCC is not detailed, the model suggests that these genes collectively contribute to HCC progression and can serve as risk factors for poor prognosis (Xu2022The). 

The role of TOMM5 in the mitochondrial protein import machinery is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function, and disruptions in this process could potentially lead to mitochondrial disorders. However, specific diseases directly resulting from TOMM5 mutations or alterations in its expression are not explicitly documented in the provided sources (Bogorodskiy2021Role). Further research is needed to elucidate the precise clinical implications of TOMM5 gene mutations and their potential impact on human health.

## Interactions
TOMM5 is a component of the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM) complex, which plays a crucial role in the import of proteins into mitochondria. It interacts with other proteins within the TOM complex, such as TOMM22, TOMM6, and TOMM20, to facilitate the recognition and translocation of precursor proteins across the outer mitochondrial membrane. The interaction between TOMM5 and TOMM22 has been confirmed through bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays, which demonstrated strong fluorescence signals in mitochondria, indicating a specific interaction between these proteins (Blakely2019Cell).

TOMM5, along with TOMM6 and TOMM7, is suggested to be involved in the assembly and stability of the TOM complex, although their exact roles are not fully clarified. These small associated proteins are not considered essential for the primary functions of the TOM complex but contribute to its structural integrity (Zhao2021Role). The interaction of TOMM5 with other TOM complex components is crucial for maintaining the functionality of the mitochondrial protein import machinery, which is integral to mitochondrial bioenergetics and protein quality control (Zhao2021Role).
