# TPPP3

## Overview
TPPP3, or tubulin polymerization promoting protein family member 3, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics. The protein, a member of the tubulin polymerization promoting protein (TPPP) family, is characterized by its ability to promote tubulin polymerization and stabilize microtubules, which are essential for various cellular processes such as cell division, intracellular transport, and maintenance of cell shape (Oláh2022Modulatory). TPPP3 is distinguished by its structural features, including a core of alpha-helices and a disordered C-terminal region, which are crucial for its interaction with tubulin and other proteins (Oláh2017Tubulin; Ovádi2009An). The protein is expressed in various tissues and plays roles in developmental processes, nerve regeneration, and reproductive biology (Oláh2022Modulatory). Additionally, TPPP3 has been implicated in pathological conditions, including cancer and cardiovascular diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Zeller2017TranscriptomeWide; Komura2019Celltype).

## Structure
TPPP3, or tubulin polymerization promoting protein family member 3, is characterized by a well-defined core structure with five alpha-helices and a long unfolded C-terminal tail, making it less disordered than its paralog TPPP/p25 (Ovádi2009An). The protein is part of the TPPP superfamily, which is defined by the presence of the p25alpha domain, a common feature among TPPP-like proteins (Orosz2012A). TPPP3 shares some microtubule-associated protein (MAP)-like features with TPPP1, such as promoting tubulin polymerization and stabilizing the microtubular network (Orosz2012A). 

The secondary structure of TPPP3 includes a highly ordered α-helical region spanning amino acids 8-102, while the region from 103-178 is disordered (Oláh2017Tubulin). The protein's disordered regions are crucial for its function, particularly in binding and polymerization activities (Oláh2017Tubulin). TPPP3 is involved in the developmental processes of the musculoskeletal system and is expressed in cells surrounding developing tendons and synovial joints (Staverosky2009Tubulin). The protein's interaction with tubulin is facilitated by its disordered C-terminal part, which plays a significant role in tubulin polymerization (Oláh2017Tubulin).

## Function
TPPP3, or tubulin polymerization promoting protein family member 3, plays a significant role in microtubule organization within healthy human cells. It is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with tubulin to promote microtubule assembly and stability, which are crucial for maintaining cell shape, enabling intracellular transport, and facilitating cell division (Oláh2022Modulatory). TPPP3 can form both homodimers and heterodimers with its homolog TPPP1, contributing to microtubule bundling and stabilization (Oláh2022Modulatory). This interaction is important for the regulation of microtubule dynamics and stability, potentially through acetylation-enhancing activity, which is vital for cellular processes such as mitosis and intracellular trafficking (Oláh2022Modulatory).

In addition to its role in microtubule dynamics, TPPP3 is involved in various developmental processes, including the musculoskeletal system and nerve regeneration (Oláh2022Modulatory). It also plays a role in implantation and pregnancy, as evidenced by its expression in the endometrium and interaction with β-catenin, which is crucial for embryo adhesion (Oláh2022Modulatory). The deletion of TPPP3 can lead to implantation failure due to the suppression of β-catenin, highlighting its importance in reproductive biology (Oláh2022Modulatory).

## Clinical Significance
TPPP3 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its altered expression levels or interactions. In the context of cancer, TPPP3 is identified as a candidate marker for the cell of origin in EWS/ATF1-induced sarcomas, particularly clear cell sarcomas (CCS). TPPP3-expressing cells, which are neural crest-derived peripheral nerve cells, have been shown to give rise to these sarcomas when the EWS/ATF1 fusion gene is present (Komura2019Celltype). The expression of TPPP3 increases upon peripheral nerve cell differentiation, suggesting its role in more mature nerve cells and its potential involvement in tumorigenesis (Komura2019Celltype).

In cardiovascular research, TPPP3 has been associated with blood pressure regulation. A transcriptome-wide analysis identified TPPP3 as one of the genes potentially involved in blood pressure traits, suggesting a role in cardiovascular disease. The study found that TPPP3 expression is associated with genetic variants in the SH2B3/LNK locus, which is implicated in blood pressure regulation (Zeller2017TranscriptomeWide).

In the field of neurodegenerative diseases, TPPP3 has been noted for its expression in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, a region relevant to motor neuron diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Although its specific clinical significance in ALS is not fully detailed, its role in microtubule dynamics suggests potential implications in neuronal function and stability (Meyer2014Identification).

## Interactions
TPPP3, a member of the tubulin polymerization promoting protein family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. TPPP3 interacts with tubulin, promoting its polymerization and stabilizing microtubules, although it has a lower polymerization potency compared to TPPP1 (Oláh2022Modulatory). TPPP3 forms both homodimers and heterodimers with TPPP1, which have implications for the microtubule network, as these dimers exhibit a bundling effect on microtubules (Oláh2022Modulatory).

In cellular contexts, TPPP3 interacts with the voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), promoting its stability and activity, which is linked to cardiovascular disorders (Oláh2022Modulatory). TPPP3 also co-localizes with β-catenin in decidualized human endometrial stromal cells, suggesting an interaction that influences inflammatory responses and decidualization processes (Shukla2019Inhibition). In cancer, TPPP3 is involved in the STAT3/Twist1 signaling pathway, promoting cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis in non-small-cell lung carcinoma (Li2018TPPP3). It also interacts with the NF-κB/COX-2 signaling pathway in breast cancer, where its silencing reduces cell proliferation and invasion (Ren2020Silence). These interactions highlight TPPP3's role in both normal cellular functions and pathological conditions.
