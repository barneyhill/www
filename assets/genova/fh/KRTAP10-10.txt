# KRTAP10-10

## Overview
KRTAP10-10 is a gene that encodes the keratin-associated protein 10-10, a structural protein predominantly involved in the formation and maintenance of hair and nail integrity. This protein is part of the keratin-associated protein family, which is known for its high cysteine content, facilitating the formation of disulfide bonds that are essential for structural stability. The keratin-associated protein 10-10 interacts with keratin intermediate filaments, contributing to the mechanical properties of hair and nails. The protein's structure is characterized by a rich composition of glycine and tyrosine, and it likely includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, stabilized by disulfide bonds. Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation may further influence its function and interactions (Karim2023Protein; Boldt2016An).

## Structure
KRTAP10-10, a member of the keratin-associated protein family, is characterized by its high cysteine content, which facilitates the formation of disulfide bonds. These bonds are crucial for the protein's structural stability and its interaction with keratin intermediate filaments in hair and nails. The primary structure of KRTAP10-10 is rich in glycine and tyrosine, which are common in keratin-associated proteins. 

In terms of secondary structure, KRTAP10-10 likely includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, typical of proteins in this family. The tertiary structure is stabilized by the aforementioned disulfide bonds, which contribute to the protein's overall conformation and functional integrity. The quaternary structure involves interactions with keratin, forming a complex that contributes to the mechanical properties of hair and nails.

Post-translational modifications of KRTAP10-10 may include phosphorylation and glycosylation, which can affect the protein's function and interactions. These modifications are common in keratin-associated proteins and play a role in regulating their activity and stability. However, specific details about the molecular structure of KRTAP10-10, such as distinct domains or prominent folds, are not provided in the available literature (Karim2023Protein; Boldt2016An).
