# AMT

## Overview
The AMT gene encodes the enzyme aminomethyltransferase, which is a pivotal component of the glycine cleavage system (GCS), a multienzyme complex located in the mitochondria. This enzyme is classified as a transferase, specifically involved in the transfer of one-carbon units. Aminomethyltransferase plays a crucial role in the degradation of glycine, facilitating the transfer of an aminomethyl group to tetrahydrofolate, thereby contributing to mitochondrial folate one-carbon metabolism (Momb2014Mitochondrial; Pai2015Glycine). The proper functioning of this enzyme is essential for various cellular processes, including nucleotide biosynthesis and methylation. Mutations in the AMT gene can lead to nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH), a severe metabolic disorder characterized by an accumulation of glycine, resulting in neurological impairments (Kure2006Comprehensive; Coughlin2017The). Additionally, these mutations have been linked to neural tube defects, highlighting the gene's significance in human health and development (Narisawa2011Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AMT gene are associated with nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the accumulation of glycine in body tissues, including the brain. This condition leads to severe neurological symptoms such as seizures, developmental delays, and intellectual disability (Kure2006Comprehensive; Coughlin2017The). NKH can present in neonatal, infantile, and late-onset forms, with the neonatal form being the most severe, often resulting in early death (Lingappa2018Identification; Azize2014Mutation).

The AMT gene encodes the T-protein component of the glycine cleavage system, which is crucial for glycine degradation. Mutations in AMT disrupt this process, leading to the symptoms of NKH (Lingappa2018Identification; Silverstein2018A). Common mutations include missense mutations, deletions, and splicing mutations, which result in a loss of enzyme function (Kure2006Comprehensive; Azize2014Mutation).

In addition to NKH, mutations in the AMT gene have been implicated in neural tube defects (NTDs) in both mice and humans. These mutations impair the glycine cleavage system, affecting folate metabolism and nucleotide biosynthesis, which are essential for neural tube closure (Narisawa2011Mutations).

## Interactions
The AMT gene encodes the aminomethyltransferase enzyme, which is a component of the glycine cleavage system (GCS). This system is a multienzyme complex that plays a crucial role in the degradation of glycine within mitochondria. The aminomethyltransferase enzyme interacts with other proteins in the GCS, including glycine decarboxylase (GLDC), the hydrogen carrier protein (GCSH), and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD), forming a multiprotein complex essential for its function (Momb2014Mitochondrial; Pai2015Glycine).

The GCS operates by transferring the aminomethyl moiety from glycine to the GCS H-protein, a process catalyzed by glycine decarboxylase. Subsequently, aminomethyltransferase transfers a one-carbon unit to tetrahydrofolate (THF), generating 5,10-methylene THF, which is a critical step in mitochondrial folate one-carbon metabolism (FOCM) (Pai2015Glycine). This interaction is vital for supplying one-carbon units necessary for various cellular functions, including nucleotide biosynthesis and methylation processes (Momb2014Mitochondrial).

While the specific physical interactions of AMT with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed in the provided excerpts, its role within the GCS and its interactions with other components of this system are well-established (Steele2020Onecarbon).
