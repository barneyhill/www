# C1QTNF7

## Overview
C1QTNF7 is a gene that encodes the protein C1q and TNF related 7, which is a member of the C1q/TNF-related protein family. This protein family is characterized by the presence of a C-terminal globular C1q domain, which is involved in forming a 10-stranded beta-sandwich with a jelly-roll topology, similar to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family (Tom2005The; Ghai2007C1q). C1q and TNF related 7 is categorized as a secreted ligand and is involved in various molecular processes that are crucial for maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis. The protein's structure, which includes a collagen-like region, facilitates trimerization, a common feature among C1q-domain proteins, aiding in their functional roles (Tom2005The). C1QTNF7 has been implicated in several diseases, including dilated cardiomyopathy and obesity-related metabolic dysfunctions, highlighting its clinical significance in cardiovascular and metabolic health (Petersen2017CTRP7; Zheng2024Exploring).

## Structure
C1QTNF7, a member of the C1q/TNF-related protein family, features a C-terminal globular C1q domain, which is a common structural motif in this protein family. The C1q domain is approximately 140 amino acids long and is involved in forming a 10-stranded beta-sandwich with a jelly-roll topology, similar to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family (Tom2005The; Ghai2007C1q). This domain is crucial for the protein's structural integrity and function, with eight invariant residues packed within the hydrophobic core, including five aromatic residues that are essential for stabilization (Tom2005The).

The protein's structure is modeled on adiponectin, suggesting a similar jelly-roll folding topology and packing of the hydrophobic core (Tom2005The). C1QTNF7 may also contain a collagen-like region, which is typical in C1q-domain-containing proteins and contributes to the formation of triple helices (Tom2005The). These structural features facilitate the trimerization of the protein, which is a common characteristic of C1q-domain proteins, aiding in their functional roles as secreted ligands (Tom2005The). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can influence its stability and function.

## Function
C1QTNF7, a member of the C1q/TNF-related protein family, is involved in various molecular processes that are crucial for maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis. This protein is part of the C1q-domain-containing (C1qDC) proteins, which are characterized by their ability to form trimeric structures, often containing a collagen-like region that promotes trimerization. This structural feature is essential for the formation of higher-order oligomers, such as trimers and hexamers, which are important for their biological functions (Tom2005The).

C1QTNF7 is part of the C1qDC-A subfamily and shares structural similarities with adiponectin, suggesting it may be involved in processes requiring stable protein-protein interactions, potentially influencing cell signaling or immune responses (Tom2005The). The C1q domain of these proteins adopts a 10-stranded jelly-roll structure, which is crucial for their stability and function (Ghai2007C1q).

While the specific molecular activities or cellular locations of C1QTNF7 are not detailed, the evolutionary conservation and potential functional specialization of C1qDC proteins indicate their importance in cellular and organismal processes, possibly functioning as signaling molecules (Tom2005The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the C1QTNF7 gene, also known as CTRP7, have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), C1QTNF7 expression is significantly lower in affected individuals compared to healthy controls. This reduced expression is associated with calcium disorders and may indirectly induce cuproptosis, contributing to myocardial cell death and dysfunction in DCM. The gene's expression is also linked to the immune microenvironment and multiple signaling pathways, suggesting its role in immune modulation related to DCM (Zheng2024Exploring).

In obesity-related metabolic dysfunctions, CTRP7 levels are elevated in obese individuals and correlate with various metabolic markers, including body mass index, glucose, and insulin levels. CTRP7 deficiency in mice has been shown to improve insulin resistance and glucose tolerance, indicating its potential role in metabolic disorders. This improvement is associated with reduced inflammation in adipose tissue and decreased liver fibrosis and stress (Petersen2017CTRP7).

The gene is also downregulated in heavier co-twins in studies of acquired obesity, suggesting a potential role in energy balance control (Kaye2017Upregulation). These findings highlight the clinical significance of C1QTNF7 in cardiovascular and metabolic health.
