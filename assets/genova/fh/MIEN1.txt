# MIEN1

## Overview
MIEN1 (Migration and Invasion Enhancer 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cellular processes related to migration and invasion, particularly in the context of cancer. The MIEN1 protein is characterized by a thioredoxin-like fold and contains a CXXC motif, suggesting a role in redox regulation. It is categorized as a cytoplasmic and membrane-associated protein due to its post-translational modifications, such as prenylation, which facilitate its localization and function in cellular signaling pathways. MIEN1 plays a crucial role in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics and cell motility by interacting with proteins like Annexin A2 and Syk kinase, thereby influencing processes such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer metastasis. Overexpression of MIEN1 is associated with various cancers, including breast, prostate, and lung cancer, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Kushwaha2019Emerging; Kpetemey2015MIEN1; Hsu2012Solution).

## Structure
The MIEN1 protein exhibits a thioredoxin-like fold, characterized by a two-layer alpha/beta sandwich structure with a beta-alpha-beta-beta-beta-alpha secondary-structure pattern (Hsu2012Solution). The protein's secondary structure includes a central α/β core domain with a mixed parallel/anti-parallel four-stranded β-sheet and two distorted α-helices. The helices are formed by residues Phe35-Gln49 and Glu86-Asn98, while the β-strands range from Glu54-Leu59, Arg24-Tyr29, Phe65-Glu68, and Val74-Ser76 (Hsu2012Solution). The hydrophobic core includes residues such as Tyr39, Leu42, and Val46, contributing to the protein's stability (Hsu2012Solution).

MIEN1 contains a CXXC motif in an exposed loop, similar to the redox-active site in thioredoxin, suggesting a role in redox regulation (Hsu2012Solution). The protein also features a canonical immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif and a prenylation consensus sequence at the C terminus, facilitating its association with the plasma membrane (Hsu2012Solution). The electrostatic potential surface of MIEN1 is predominantly negative, which may influence its binding interactions (Hsu2012Solution). The protein is highly thermally stable, with a Tm value of about 90°C, and maintains its structure across various pH levels (Hsu2012Solution).

## Function
MIEN1 (Migration and Invasion Enhancer 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cellular processes related to migration and invasion. In healthy human cells, MIEN1 is associated with the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics, influencing cell motility. It is active in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane, playing a role in signal transduction pathways that affect cell movement and potentially impacting tissue development and repair.

MIEN1 is involved in enhancing the motility of cells by influencing actin dynamics and gene expression. It regulates actin cytoskeletal dynamics, which are crucial for cellular locomotion, by acting through cofilin and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) (Van2018CRISPR). The protein is post-translationally modified by prenylation, which facilitates its membrane localization and function. This modification is crucial for MIEN1's role in filopodia formation and directional migration (Kushwaha2019Emerging; Rajendiran2014MicroRNA940).

MIEN1's biological activity is dependent on its prenylation and subsequent methylation at the C-terminus, enhancing its membrane association (Kushwaha2019Emerging). While the protein's ability to interact with the membrane and participate in cellular signaling is relevant in normal cellular functions, specific functions of MIEN1 in healthy human cells are not detailed in the available literature (Kushwaha2019Emerging).

## Clinical Significance
MIEN1 (migration and invasion enhancer 1) is significantly implicated in cancer progression and metastasis. Overexpression of MIEN1 is observed in various cancers, including breast, prostate, and lung cancer, and is associated with poor prognosis and increased metastatic potential (Kushwaha2019Emerging; Chang2019Migration). In breast cancer, MIEN1 is overexpressed from early stages to metastasis, correlating with poor survival outcomes, particularly in Her-2 positive and luminal B subtypes (Kpetemey2015MIEN1). It interacts with Annexin A2, enhancing its phosphorylation and promoting tumor cell migration and invasion (Kpetemey2015MIEN1).

In prostate cancer, MIEN1 overexpression is linked to increased cell proliferation, invasion, and resistance to apoptosis, mediated through the Akt/NF-kB signaling pathway (Chang2019Migration). MicroRNA-940 (miR-940) has been identified as a modulator of MIEN1, where its loss leads to increased MIEN1 expression, enhancing cancer progression (Rajendiran2014MicroRNA940).

MIEN1's role in cancer is further supported by its involvement in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which enhances the invasive potential of tumor cells (Kushwaha2019Emerging). These findings suggest that MIEN1 is a potential target for therapeutic interventions in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
MIEN1 (Migration and Invasion Enhancer 1) is known to participate in several significant protein interactions that contribute to its role in cancer progression. One of the primary interactions is with Annexin A2 (AnxA2), where MIEN1 enhances the phosphorylation of AnxA2 at the Y23 residue. This interaction promotes the translocation of AnxA2 to the cell surface, facilitating cancer cell migration and invasion by increasing plasmin generation, which aids in extracellular matrix degradation (Kpetemey2015MIEN1).

MIEN1 also interacts with the Syk kinase through its immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), influencing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer metastasis (Kushwaha2019Emerging). Additionally, MIEN1 is involved in the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, which leads to the activation of NF-kB and the expression of proteases and angiogenic factors like MMP-9, uPA, and VEGF, further promoting cancer cell migration and invasion (Kushwaha2019Emerging).

In ovarian cancer, MIEN1 has been identified as an interactor with HMGB2, a protein associated with cancer hallmarks such as metastasis and angiogenesis. This interaction was validated through co-immunoprecipitation studies, highlighting MIEN1's involvement in the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (CámaraQuílez2020The).
