# ZSWIM1

## Overview
ZSWIM1 is a gene that encodes the protein zinc finger SWIM-type containing 1, which is characterized by the presence of a zinc finger SWIM motif. This motif is known for its role in facilitating protein-protein interactions and potentially binding to DNA, suggesting a function in transcriptional regulation and genomic stability (Ko2014ZSWIM1:). The protein is predominantly expressed in leukocytes, particularly in naïve CD4+ T cells, indicating its involvement in early T cell differentiation and immune response modulation (Ko2014ZSWIM1:). ZSWIM1 expression is modulated by activation signals and varies under different T helper cell polarizing conditions, such as Th17 and Th1, highlighting its potential role in T cell differentiation pathways (Ko2014ZSWIM1:). Additionally, ZSWIM1 has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma and ovarian cancer, where it may influence tumor immunity and progression through its interactions with immune-related pathways (Pawar2022Identification; Liu2021Development).

## Structure


## Function
The ZSWIM1 gene encodes a protein that contains a zinc finger SWIM motif, which is involved in protein-protein interactions and potentially DNA binding. This protein is primarily expressed in leukocytes, with notable enrichment in naïve CD4+ T cells, suggesting a role in early T cell differentiation (Ko2014ZSWIM1:). ZSWIM1 expression is sensitive to activation signals, being reduced in activated effector memory T cells, and is maintained under Th17 polarizing conditions but not in Th1 conditions. This indicates a role in Th17 cell differentiation and a potential downregulation during Th1 differentiation (Ko2014ZSWIM1:).

In Th17 cells, ZSWIM1 expression is significantly higher compared to Th1 cells, as confirmed by qPCR analysis. This suggests that ZSWIM1 may play a role in the differentiation or function of Th17 cells, although its precise function in healthy human cells remains unclear (Ko2014ZSWIM1:). The protein's activity is likely nuclear, given its involvement in transcriptional regulation and potential DNA binding capabilities, contributing to maintaining genomic stability and regulating gene expression (Ko2014ZSWIM1:).

## Clinical Significance
ZSWIM1 has been implicated in the prognosis of uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC). Studies have shown that ZSWIM1 expression is negatively correlated with regulatory T cells (Tregs) in UCEC, suggesting a role in tumor immunity. Its expression is also negatively correlated with immunopotentiators, immunosuppressants, MHC molecules, chemokines, and receptors, indicating its involvement in immune-related pathways. The expression of ZSWIM1 varies among different immune and molecular subtypes of UCEC, and it is part of a gene module highly correlated with Tregs. This module's functions and pathways are primarily immune-related, highlighting ZSWIM1's potential impact on cancer progression through immune modulation (Liu2021Development).

In ovarian cancer, ZSWIM1 is noted for its role in the development or function of T helper cells, which are crucial for mediating anti-tumor immunity. Alterations in ZSWIM1 expression could impact immune responses against tumors, potentially influencing cancer progression (Pawar2022Identification).

While ZSWIM1 is mentioned in the context of its correlation with other genes in cancer studies, specific diseases directly linked to ZSWIM1 mutations are not detailed in the provided context (Jin2021A).
