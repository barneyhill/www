# MS4A5

## Overview
The MS4A5 gene encodes the membrane-spanning 4-domains subfamily A member 5 (MS4A5) protein, which is part of the MS4A gene family. This family is characterized by proteins with four transmembrane domains, which are integral to their function as transmembrane proteins (Liang2001Identification; Liang2001Structural). The MS4A5 protein, consisting of 200 amino acids, is the smallest member of this family and exhibits structural diversity through alternative splicing, resulting in variants with different transmembrane domain configurations (Liang2001Identification; Liang2001Structural). The presence of a protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation site suggests a role in cellular signaling pathways, potentially influencing the protein's function through post-translational modifications (Ishibashi2001Identification).

## Structure
The MS4A5 protein is a member of the MS4A gene family, characterized by its four transmembrane domains. These domains are highly conserved and are crucial for the protein's function, allowing it to span the cell membrane multiple times (Liang2001Identification; Liang2001Structural). The primary structure of MS4A5 consists of 200 amino acids, making it the smallest member of the MS4A family (Liang2001Identification). 

A notable feature of the MS4A5 protein is its potential splice variants. One such variant results from the splicing out of an exon encoding the third transmembrane domain and the second extracellular loop, leading to a truncated protein with three transmembrane domains and an extracellular carboxyl-terminal domain (Liang2001Structural). This structural variation is due to alternative splicing, which is common in the MS4A gene family and contributes to the diversity of protein products (Liang2001Structural).

The MS4A5 protein also contains a consensus protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation site (KRKTT) at the intracellular loop, which may play a role in its post-translational modification and function (Ishibashi2001Identification).
