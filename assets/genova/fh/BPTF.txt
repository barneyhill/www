# BPTF

## Overview
BPTF, or Bromodomain PHD finger transcription factor, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is a critical component of the nucleosome remodeling factor (NURF) complex. This protein is categorized as a transcription factor due to its role in regulating gene expression through chromatin remodeling. The BPTF protein contains a PHD finger and a bromodomain, which enable it to interact with specific histone modifications, such as trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) and acetylation of histone H4 lysine 16 (H4K16ac). These interactions facilitate the sliding of nucleosomes, thereby modulating chromatin structure and accessibility, which is essential for transcriptional regulation. BPTF is involved in various biological processes, including embryonic development and cell differentiation, and its dysregulation is associated with several diseases, including cancer and developmental disorders (Li2006Molecular; Dar2015The; Stankiewicz2017Haploinsufficiency).

## Structure
The BPTF protein is a component of the NURF chromatin remodeling complex and contains a PHD finger and a bromodomain, which are crucial for its function. The PHD finger specifically recognizes the histone H3 tail trimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) through the formation of an anti-parallel β-sheet, with the long side chains of arginine 2 (R2) and K4me3 fitting into adjacent preformed surface pockets on the PHD finger (Li2006Molecular). This interaction is stabilized by van der Waals and cation-π interactions within a cage of four aromatic amino acids (Li2006Molecular). The bromodomain, located proximal to the PHD finger, recognizes acetylated lysines on histone H4, such as H4K16ac, H4K12ac, and H4K20ac (Ruthenburg2011Recognition).

The BPTF protein structure includes a PHD finger-linker-bromodomain fragment, with an α-helical linker connecting the PHD finger and bromodomains, forming a complex with a buried surface area of 1,030 Å² (Li2006Molecular). The spatial arrangement of these domains is tightly coupled, allowing for multivalent interactions with histone modifications (Ruthenburg2011Recognition). The PHD-bromo module exhibits a bivalent interaction, enhancing specificity for doubly modified nucleosomes with H3K4me3 and H4K16ac marks (Ruthenburg2011Recognition).

## Function
The BPTF gene encodes the Bromodomain PHD finger transcription factor, a crucial component of the nucleosome remodeling factor (NURF) complex, which is part of the ISWI chromatin-remodeling family. BPTF plays a significant role in chromatin remodeling, a process essential for regulating DNA accessibility and transcriptional activation. In healthy human cells, BPTF is involved in the formation of the anterior-posterior axis during embryonic development and is necessary for the differentiation of mesoderm, endoderm, and ectoderm lineages. It is also important for trophoblast differentiation during early development (Stankiewicz2017Haploinsufficiency).

BPTF mediates the binding of the NURF complex to chromatin through interactions with specific histone modifications, such as trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) and acetylation of lysine 16 in histone H4 (H4K16ac). This selective targeting to chromatin is crucial for its function in transcriptional regulation. BPTF is involved in maintaining chromatin accessibility and the self-renewal capacity of mammary gland stem cells. It also plays a role in T cell homeostasis and function, inhibiting natural killer (NK) cell activity and maintaining the abundance of natural cytotoxicity receptor co-ligands (Stankiewicz2017Haploinsufficiency).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the BPTF gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. BPTF haploinsufficiency is linked to syndromic developmental and speech delay, postnatal microcephaly, and dysmorphic features. These conditions are often due to frameshift indels, nonsense, and missense variants, as well as CNV deletions in the BPTF gene. The gene is highly intolerant to loss-of-function mutations, with a probability of loss-of-function intolerance (pLI) score of 1.0, suggesting that its disruption can lead to significant developmental issues (Stankiewicz2017Haploinsufficiency).

In cancer, BPTF is implicated in the progression of various malignancies. It is often amplified in melanoma, where its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to BRAF-targeted therapies (Dar2015The). In neuroblastoma, high BPTF expression correlates with poor survival and is linked to the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, promoting tumor growth and metastasis (Jiang2023BPTF). BPTF also plays a role in high-grade gliomas, where it regulates tumor growth through the MYC pathway (Green2019BPTF). In hepatocellular carcinoma, BPTF modulates hTERT signaling and cancer stem cell traits, contributing to tumor growth and metastasis (Zhao2019BPTF).

## Interactions
BPTF, a component of the NURF chromatin remodeling complex, interacts with chromatin through its PHD and bromodomain modules. The PHD domain of BPTF specifically binds to histone H3 when it is trimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me3), a mark associated with active transcription. This interaction is enhanced by the presence of acetylated histone H4, particularly at lysine 16 (H4K16ac), which is recognized by the BPTF bromodomain. The simultaneous binding of these domains to their respective histone marks facilitates BPTF's role in nucleosome sliding and gene regulation (Zahid2021Opportunity; Ruthenburg2011Recognition).

BPTF also interacts with acetylated histone variant H2A.Z, specifically at lysines 7 and 13, although these interactions are weaker compared to H4K16ac. The bromodomain of BPTF shows a preference for certain acetylation patterns on H2A.Z, such as diacetylation at lysines 4 and 11, which may play a role in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation (Perell2017Specific).

These interactions are crucial for the recruitment or stabilization of BPTF at specific genomic loci, influencing gene expression by modulating chromatin structure and accessibility (Ruthenburg2011Recognition).
