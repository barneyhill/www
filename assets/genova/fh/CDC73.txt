# CDC73

## Overview
CDC73 is a gene that encodes the protein parafibromin, which functions as a tumor suppressor and is a critical component of the PAF1 transcriptional complex. Parafibromin is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, histone modification, and RNA processing. It plays a significant role in maintaining genome stability and telomere homeostasis, acting as a negative regulator of cell cycle progression and promoting apoptosis. Structurally, parafibromin contains distinct domains that facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its involvement in chromatin association and transcription elongation. Mutations in CDC73 are linked to several clinical conditions, such as hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome and parathyroid carcinoma, underscoring its importance in preventing tumorigenesis (Hahn2011The; Sun2017Crystal; Newey2010Cell).

## Structure
The CDC73 gene encodes a protein known as parafibromin, which is a component of the PAF1 complex involved in transcriptional regulation. The protein structure includes distinct domains with specific functions. The N-terminal domain (NTD) of human CDC73 consists of the first 111 residues and forms a globular domain with a novel fold, characterized by four α helices and one anti-parallel β-sheet composed of three β-strands (Sun2017Crystal). This domain includes a β-catenin interaction domain and a nuclear localization signal, which are crucial for its function (Sun2017Crystal).

The C-terminal domain of CDC73 adopts a Ras-like fold, similar to small GTPases, although it lacks a nucleotide-binding pocket, suggesting a role in protein-protein interactions rather than nucleotide binding (Amrich2012Cdc73). This domain is important for the association of the PAF1 complex with chromatin and is involved in histone modifications, specifically H3 Lys-36 trimethylation (Amrich2012Cdc73). The C-terminal domain's structure includes a six-stranded β-sheet flanked by α-helices, contributing to its function in transcription elongation (Chen2012Crystallographic).

Mutations in CDC73, particularly in the NTD, are associated with hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome, affecting protein stability and folding (Sun2017Crystal). The protein can undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its function.

## Function
The CDC73 gene encodes parafibromin, a tumor suppressor protein that is a component of the PAF1 transcriptional complex. This complex is involved in several critical cellular processes, including transcriptional elongation, histone modification, and RNA processing. Parafibromin interacts with RNA polymerase II, facilitating transcriptional elongation and the maintenance of histone H2B monoubiquitination at lysine 120 (H2B-K120), a modification important for transcription regulation and chromatin dynamics (Hahn2011The).

CDC73 also plays a role in maintaining genome stability and telomere homeostasis. It is involved in the regulation of telomerase function, contributing to telomere integrity and preventing genome instability (Nene2018Cdc73). The protein is active in the nucleus and nucleolus, where it acts as a negative regulator of cell cycle progression and promotes apoptosis, thereby inhibiting cellular proliferation (Hahn2011The).

In addition to its role in transcriptional regulation, CDC73 is implicated in the regulation of cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding proteins (CPEBs), suggesting a broader impact on gene expression at both transcriptional and translational levels (Zhang2010Cytoplasmic). The loss of CDC73 function is associated with various cancers, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing tumorigenesis (Hahn2011The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CDC73 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor (HPT-JT) syndrome, familial isolated hyperparathyroidism (FIHP), and parathyroid carcinoma (PC). HPT-JT syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by parathyroid tumors, ossifying fibromas of the jaw, and renal and uterine tumors. Approximately 95% of HPT-JT patients develop parathyroid tumors, with a 15% risk of parathyroid carcinoma (Ciuffi2019Characterization; Newey2010Cell). Germline mutations in CDC73 are found in about 75% of HPT-JT patients, often leading to loss of parafibromin expression (Cardoso2017Molecular).

In FIHP, CDC73 mutations occur in about 8% of patients, typically resulting in frameshift or nonsense mutations (Cardoso2017Molecular). Parathyroid carcinoma is frequently associated with CDC73 mutations, with somatic mutations found in up to 70% of cases. These mutations are rare in benign parathyroid adenomas (Cetani2019Atypical). The same germline mutations can be linked to different conditions, indicating a lack of genotype-phenotype correlation (Cardoso2017Molecular).

CDC73 mutations often result in premature truncation of parafibromin, supporting its role as a tumor suppressor (Newey2010Cell). These mutations can disrupt normal gene expression and protein interactions, contributing to tumorigenesis.

## Interactions
CDC73, also known as parafibromin, is a tumor suppressor protein that participates in several critical protein-protein interactions. It is a component of the human PAF1 complex, which includes other proteins such as hPaf1, hLeo1, and hCtr9. These interactions were confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, indicating that parafibromin is an integral part of this complex (RozenblattRosen2005The).

CDC73 also interacts with the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) and cleavage stimulation factor (CstF) complexes, which are essential for mRNA 3' end processing. These interactions are protein-protein based and remain intact after RNase treatment, suggesting a stable association (RozenblattRosen2009The).

In yeast, CDC73 is part of a complex with RNA polymerase II, Paf1p, Hpr1p, and Ccr4p, playing a role in transcription regulation and protein kinase C signaling (Chang1999A). The C-terminal domain of CDC73 is crucial for the association of the PAF1 complex with chromatin, facilitating its interaction with RNA polymerase II (Amrich2012Cdc73).

CDC73 also interacts with the ring finger proteins RNF20 and RNF40, components of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which are important for maintaining histone H2B monoubiquitination. This interaction is essential for transcriptional regulation and the DNA damage response (Hahn2011The).
