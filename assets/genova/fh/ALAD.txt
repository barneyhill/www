# ALAD

## Overview
The ALAD gene encodes the enzyme aminolevulinate dehydratase, a critical component of the heme biosynthetic pathway. This enzyme, categorized as a lyase, facilitates the condensation of two molecules of delta-aminolevulinic acid to form porphobilinogen, an essential precursor in heme production. Aminolevulinate dehydratase is a homooctameric protein that requires zinc ions and an iron-sulfur cluster for its catalytic activity, with its structure characterized by a TIM barrel fold. The enzyme is predominantly active in erythrocyte precursors and liver cells, where it supports normal heme synthesis, vital for oxygen transport and cellular respiration. Mutations in the ALAD gene can lead to delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase porphyria, a rare disorder marked by reduced enzyme activity and associated clinical symptoms. Additionally, ALAD interacts with cellular components such as the proteasome and Hsp70, indicating its involvement in broader cellular processes beyond heme biosynthesis (Schmitt2015Involvement; Chiabrando2014Heme; Akagi2006δAminolevulinate).

## Structure
The human gene ALAD encodes the enzyme aminolevulinate dehydratase, which plays a crucial role in heme biosynthesis. The enzyme is a homooctamer, meaning it forms an eight-subunit quaternary structure, essential for its enzymatic function (Liu2020Heme; Inoue2008Cosynthesis). Each subunit of ALAD contains a TIM barrel fold, a common protein fold characterized by eight alpha-helices and eight parallel beta-strands (Breinig2003Control). 

ALAD requires zinc ions for its catalytic activity, with specific zinc-binding sites, ZnA and ZnB, being crucial for its function. The ZnB site primarily consists of cysteine residues, while the ZnA site is composed of more polar residues (Akagi2006δAminolevulinate). Mutations affecting these sites can lead to significant reductions in enzyme activity, as seen in conditions like ALAD porphyria (Inoue2008Cosynthesis).

The enzyme can also coordinate an iron-sulfur ([Fe4S4]) cluster, which is essential for its full enzymatic activity. This cluster is coordinated by conserved cysteine residues and plays a structural role in the enzyme's function (Liu2020Heme). The presence of the [Fe4S4] cluster is associated with the formation of the more active homo-octameric structure (Liu2020Heme).

## Function
The ALAD gene encodes the enzyme delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase (ALAD), which plays a crucial role in the heme biosynthetic pathway. This enzyme catalyzes the condensation of two molecules of delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) to form porphobilinogen, a monopyrrole that is an early precursor in the synthesis of heme (Chiabrando2014Heme; Akagi2006δAminolevulinate). ALAD is primarily active in the cytoplasm of erythrocyte precursors and liver cells, where it is essential for normal heme production, a critical component for oxygen transport and cellular respiration (Chiabrando2014Heme).

In healthy human cells, ALAD functions as a soluble enzyme present in large excess compared to other enzymes in the heme biosynthetic pathway, which typically prevents clinical consequences from partial deficiencies in its activity (Akagi2006δAminolevulinate). The enzyme's activity is dependent on zinc binding, and it is crucial for maintaining normal heme production. Deficiencies in ALAD activity can lead to significant clinical symptoms, such as those seen in inherited ALAD deficiency porphyria (ADP) or acquired conditions due to lead poisoning (Akagi2006δAminolevulinate). The enzyme's role in heme biosynthesis is also linked to adipogenesis and mitochondrial respiratory activity, highlighting its importance in broader metabolic processes (Moreno‐Navarrete2017Heme).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ALAD gene can lead to delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase porphyria (ADP), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a significant deficiency in ALAD enzyme activity. This condition is associated with acute neurovisceral attacks, abdominal pain, and peripheral neuropathy. ADP is the rarest form of porphyria, with only a few documented cases worldwide (Graff2022Case; Lahiji20205Aminolevulinate). 

The disease is linked to biallelic mutations in the ALAD gene, resulting in markedly reduced enzyme activity. For instance, specific mutations such as C718T and G820A have been identified, leading to amino acid substitutions that significantly impair enzyme function (Ishida1992Cloning). These mutations can result in compound heterozygosity, where different mutations are inherited from each parent, contributing to the clinical manifestations of ADP (Ishida1992Cloning).

In addition to genetic mutations, ALAD activity can be inhibited by environmental factors such as lead exposure, which mimics the biochemical abnormalities seen in ADP. Lead poisoning can exacerbate symptoms by further reducing ALAD activity, leading to anemia and other systemic effects (Akagi2006δAminolevulinate).

## Interactions
Aminolevulinate dehydratase (ALAD) is known to interact with the proteasome, a complex responsible for protein degradation. ALAD specifically binds to the 20S proteasome core, replacing the 19S regulatory cap, which may inhibit proteasomal activity by preventing substrate entry into the catalytic core (Schmitt2015Involvement). This interaction is particularly significant in prostate cancer cells, where ALAD preferentially binds to ubiquitinated proteasomal α2 subunits, suggesting a role in the ubiquitination and acetylation of these subunits (Schmitt2015Involvement).

ALAD has been identified as a proteasome-interacting protein through immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, showing a stronger association with the 20S proteasome compared to the 26S proteasome (BardagGorce2011Deltaaminolevulinic). This interaction modulates proteasome activity, specifically enhancing chymotrypsin-like and trypsin-like activities, indicating a regulatory role in proteolytic processes (BardagGorce2011Deltaaminolevulinic).

ALAD also interacts with the chaperone protein Hsp70, which suggests a potential role in cell-cycle control and homeostasis (MillsDavies2017Structural). These interactions highlight ALAD's multifaceted role beyond its enzymatic function in heme biosynthesis, implicating it in broader cellular regulatory mechanisms.
