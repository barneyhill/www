# CCDC157

## Overview
CCDC157 is a gene that encodes the protein coiled-coil domain containing 157, which is primarily involved in the process of spermatogenesis. This protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domains, which are indicative of its potential role in facilitating protein-protein interactions, possibly influencing cellular structural organization or signaling pathways. CCDC157 is notably expressed in the testes, particularly during the spermatid stages, underscoring its importance in the maturation of sperm cells (Yuan2019Drosophila). The gene's expression is significantly reduced in individuals with idiopathic non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA), linking it to male fertility issues (Yuan2019Drosophila). Additionally, CCDC157 has been implicated in the progression of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), where its expression is regulated by a non-coding enhancer region (Woo2023Integrative). Despite its recognized roles, the precise molecular mechanisms and interactions of CCDC157 remain to be fully elucidated.

## Function
CCDC157 is a human gene encoding a protein that plays a significant role in spermatogenesis, particularly in the later stages of sperm development. The protein is highly expressed in the testes, specifically in spermatid stages, but not in spermatogonia and spermatocyte stages, indicating its involvement in the maturation of sperm cells (Yuan2019Drosophila). CCDC157 shares a conserved domain with its Drosophila homolog, Pif1A, which is essential for the individualization process during spermatogenesis. This process involves the removal of bulk cytoplasm and the organization of individualization complexes, which are crucial for the maturation of sperm (Yuan2019Drosophila).

In humans, CCDC157 expression is significantly higher in individuals with normal spermatogenesis compared to those with idiopathic non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA), a condition associated with male infertility (Yuan2019Drosophila). The protein's coiled-coil domains suggest a role in protein-protein interactions, potentially influencing cellular structural organization or signaling pathways (Yuan2019Drosophila). Although the specific molecular functions of CCDC157 in humans are not fully understood, its expression pattern and homologous functions in Drosophila imply a critical role in male fertility and sperm maturation (Yuan2019Drosophila).

## Clinical Significance
CCDC157 has been implicated in several medical conditions due to its altered expression or mutations. In humans, CCDC157 is associated with idiopathic non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA), a condition characterized by a lack of sperm in the semen due to impaired spermatogenesis. Studies have shown that CCDC157 expression is significantly lower in men with NOA compared to those with normal spermatogenesis, suggesting its critical role in male fertility (Yuan2019Drosophila).

In the context of cancer, CCDC157 has been linked to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). A non-coding regulatory region, GH22I030351, acts as an enhancer for CCDC157, and mutations in this region are associated with increased expression of the gene, promoting prostate cancer growth. Experimental approaches have demonstrated that silencing CCDC157 or its enhancer reduces tumor growth, indicating its role as a driver of prostate cancer (Woo2023Integrative).

Additionally, CCDC157 has been mentioned in genetic studies related to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in individuals with Williams-Beuren Syndrome, although no direct association with ASD was confirmed (CodinaSola2019Genetic). Despite these findings, the specific molecular functions and interactions of CCDC157 remain to be fully elucidated.
