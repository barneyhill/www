# ACAP3

## Overview
ACAP3 is a gene that encodes the protein ArfGAP with coiled-coil, ankyrin repeat, and PH domains 3, which functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) specific to the small GTPase Arf6. This protein plays a pivotal role in cellular processes such as actin cytoskeleton remodeling, endocytosis, and membrane trafficking. It is particularly significant in neuronal cells, where it regulates neurite outgrowth and axonal development, crucial for neuronal migration and morphogenesis in the developing brain. ACAP3's activity is linked to the production of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, influencing actin dynamics and membrane structure formation. The gene's involvement in neurological disorders, including autism and Alzheimer's disease, underscores its clinical significance, with alterations in its expression linked to various pathologies (Miura2016ACAP3; Suchkova2020Length).

## Function
The ACAP3 gene encodes a protein that functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) specific to the small GTPase Arf6. This protein is involved in several critical cellular processes, including the regulation of actin cytoskeleton remodeling, endocytosis, and membrane trafficking events. ACAP3 facilitates the cycling between the active (GTP-bound) and inactive (GDP-bound) forms of Arf6, which is essential for proper cellular events such as neurite outgrowth in neurons (Miura2016ACAP3).

In healthy human cells, ACAP3 is active in the nucleoplasm and Golgi apparatus, playing a role in cellular signaling pathways, cell adhesion, and movement. It is particularly important in neuronal cells, where it regulates neurite outgrowth and axonal development by modulating Arf6 activity. This regulation is crucial for neuronal migration and morphogenesis, especially in the developing cerebral cortex and hippocampus (Miura2016ACAP3; Suchkova2020Length).

ACAP3's activity is also linked to the production of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) through the activation of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5K), affecting actin cytoskeleton dynamics and membrane structure formation, which are vital for cellular processes like endocytosis and exocytosis (Miura2016ACAP3).

## Clinical Significance
The ACAP3 gene has been implicated in various neurological disorders due to its role in cellular processes such as actin cytoskeleton remodeling and neuronal migration. Alterations in ACAP3 expression levels have been associated with conditions like autism and Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its potential involvement in these pathologies (Suchkova2020Length). The UPS29 minisatellite within the ACAP3 gene has been studied as a molecular biomarker for epilepsy. Short UPS29 alleles are linked to an increased risk of epilepsy, with sex-specific effects observed. In women, these alleles are associated with symptomatic and cryptogenic epilepsy, while in men, they are linked to ataxia and sensory impairment (Suchkova2020Length). Hypomethylated UPS29 alleles are more frequent in epilepsy patients, suggesting a role in the disease's pathogenesis (Suchkova2020Length). The UPS29 minisatellite may also influence ACAP3 expression, contributing to pathological changes in the brain (Suchkova2020Length). Additionally, ACAP3 is part of a linkage group with genes associated with several neurological conditions, including Parkinson's disease and spinocerebral ataxia with myoclonic seizures (Suchkova2020Length). These findings suggest that ACAP3 abnormalities could lead to comorbidities with other diseases, such as cerebrovascular pathologies and neuroblastoma (Suchkova2020Length).

## Interactions
ACAP3 interacts specifically with the small GTPase Arf6, playing a crucial role in regulating its activity. ACAP3 functions as an Arf6-specific GTPase-activating protein (GAP), facilitating the conversion of Arf6 from its active GTP-bound form to its inactive GDP-bound form. This interaction is essential for the regulation of neurite outgrowth in mouse hippocampal neurons, as demonstrated by experiments showing that wild-type ACAP3 decreases the level of active Arf6, while a GAP activity-deficient mutant does not (Miura2016ACAP3).

ACAP3 co-localizes with Arf6 at the neurite tips, indicating a spatially specific interaction that is critical for its function in neurite outgrowth. Knockdown of ACAP3 results in increased levels of active Arf6, further supporting the role of ACAP3 in modulating Arf6 activity (Miura2016ACAP3). The interaction between ACAP3 and Arf6 is central to the regulation of neurite outgrowth, as evidenced by the ability of a fast cycle mutant of Arf6 to rescue neurite outgrowth suppressed by ACAP3 knockdown (Miura2016ACAP3).

While the study suggests potential downstream interactions involving PIP5K and Rac1, these interactions are not directly attributed to ACAP3 but rather to the broader signaling pathways influenced by Arf6 activity (Miura2016ACAP3).
