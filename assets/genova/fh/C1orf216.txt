# C1orf216

## Overview
C1orf216 is a gene located on chromosome 1 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 1 open reading frame 216. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its precise biological function remains to be fully elucidated. Emerging research suggests that C1orf216 may play a role in the regulation of gene expression and cellular signaling pathways. The protein has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer and metabolic disorders, indicating its potential as a biomarker for disease prognosis and treatment response. Studies have shown that alterations in the expression of C1orf216 are associated with hepatocellular carcinoma, chronic myelogenous leukemia, and vascular diseases, as well as type 1 and type 2 diabetes (Cao2020kTWAS:; Zalewski2021Identification; Burguillo2010Metaanalysis; Liu2024Identification).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
C1orf216 has been implicated in several diseases through alterations in its expression levels. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), elevated expression of C1orf216 is associated with poor overall survival outcomes, although its link to disease-free survival is not statistically significant. The gene's expression is notably higher in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues and is elevated in tumors with satellite nodules, correlating with larger tumor sizes (Liu2024Identification). 

In chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), C1orf216 is significantly overexpressed in patients who do not respond to imatinib treatment, suggesting its potential role as a biomarker for treatment response (Burguillo2010Metaanalysis). 

In the context of vascular diseases, C1orf216 expression is influenced by statin use, showing a significant relationship in the comparison between lower extremities arterial disease (LEAD) and chronic venous disease (CVD) (Zalewski2021Identification). 

Additionally, C1orf216 has been identified as significantly associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and type 1 diabetes (T1D) through transcriptome-wide association studies, although the specific clinical significance in these conditions remains unclear (Cao2020kTWAS:).
