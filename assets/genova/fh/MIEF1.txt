# MIEF1

## Overview
MIEF1, or mitochondrial elongation factor 1, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics, specifically promoting mitochondrial fusion over fission. The protein, categorized as a mitochondrial outer membrane protein, plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function, which is vital for cellular energy production and homeostasis. MIEF1 achieves this by interacting with key proteins involved in mitochondrial dynamics, such as Drp1, Mfn1, and Mfn2, thereby influencing the balance between mitochondrial division and elongation. This balance is essential for cellular metabolism and overall organismal health. Mutations in the MIEF1 gene have been associated with certain pathologies, including optic neuropathy and thyroid cell dysfunction, highlighting its clinical significance (Yu2021MIEF12; Charif2021Dominant; Zhao2011Human).

## Structure
MIEF1, or mitochondrial elongation factor 1, is a protein encoded by the SMCR7L gene and consists of 463 amino acids. It features an N-terminal transmembrane domain, which is crucial for its localization to the mitochondrial outer membrane (Zhao2011Human). The protein is highly conserved across vertebrate species and is absent in yeast, invertebrates, and plants (Zhao2011Human).

MIEF1 can oligomerize, forming dimers and higher-order structures, with residues 49 to 195 being essential for dimerization (Zhao2011Human). The molecular mass of MIEF1 is approximately 56 kDa as a monomer and forms a dimer of about 110 kDa under non-reducing conditions (Zhao2011Human). The protein interacts with Drp1, a key player in mitochondrial fission, and recruits it to the mitochondria, inhibiting Drp1-mediated fission and promoting mitochondrial fusion (Zhao2011Human).

The middle region (residues 160-380) and the C-terminal region (420-451aa) of MIEF1 are important for binding to Drp1 (Yu2021MIEF12). MIEF1's interaction with Drp1 is crucial for its role in mitochondrial dynamics, particularly in promoting fusion over fission (Zhao2011Human). The protein's ability to form dimers or oligomers is essential for its function in promoting mitochondrial fusion (Yu2021MIEF12).

## Function
MIEF1, or mitochondrial elongation factor 1, is a key regulator of mitochondrial dynamics, primarily promoting mitochondrial fusion over fission. It is an integral protein of the mitochondrial outer membrane, where it recruits the fission protein Drp1, but inhibits its activity, thus favoring fusion and leading to elongated mitochondrial structures (Zhao2011Human). MIEF1's interaction with Drp1 is crucial for this process, as it sequesters Drp1 in an inactive form, preventing mitochondrial fragmentation (Yu2021MIEF12).

MIEF1 also interacts with pro-fusion proteins such as Mfn1 and Mfn2, facilitating the tethering of adjacent mitochondria, which is essential for the fusion process (Yu2021MIEF12). This protein is involved in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function, which is vital for cellular energy production and homeostasis (Zhao2011Human). In addition to its role in mitochondrial dynamics, MIEF1 influences cellular responses to apoptotic stimuli and enhances autophagic activity, although it does not directly induce apoptosis (Zhao2011Human).

MIEF1's activity is crucial for maintaining the balance between mitochondrial division and elongation, impacting cellular metabolism and overall organismal health (Zhao2011Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MIEF1 gene have been linked to a unique form of late-onset progressive optic neuropathy. This condition is characterized by the initial loss of peripheral visual fields and is associated with heterozygous pathogenic mutations in MIEF1, specifically the p.Y240N and p.R146W variants. These mutations disrupt mitochondrial network dynamics, particularly affecting mitochondrial fusion, although they do not alter the localization or oligomerization of the MID51 protein encoded by MIEF1 (Charif2021Dominant).

Alterations in MIEF1 expression have also been implicated in thyroid cell dysfunction and apoptosis. In the context of TNFa-induced immune abnormalities, upregulation of MIEF1 is associated with reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis. Deletion of MIEF1 can enhance thyroid cell survival by upregulating the AMPK-PTEN signaling pathway, suggesting a protective role against TNFa-induced cell death (Zhang2020Mief1).

MIEF1 is involved in regulating apoptosis and mitophagy. Its deficiency leads to increased sensitivity to apoptosis by promoting BAX translocation to mitochondria and enhancing PINK1-PRKN-mediated mitophagy. This suggests that MIEF1 plays a critical role in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and its loss can influence cellular responses to apoptotic and mitophagic stimuli (Xian2019Loss).

## Interactions
MIEF1, also known as mitochondrial elongation factor 1, is involved in mitochondrial dynamics through its interactions with several key proteins. MIEF1 interacts with the pro-fusion GTPases Mfn1 and Mfn2, enhancing mitochondrial fusion in a manner dependent on these proteins and OPA1, but independent of Drp1 (Yu2021MIEF12). MIEF1 also recruits Drp1 to the mitochondrial outer membrane, inhibiting its fission-promoting activity, which results in a fusion phenotype characterized by elongated mitochondrial tubules (Zhao2011Human). 

MIEF1's interaction with Drp1 is crucial for promoting mitochondrial fusion rather than fission, and this interaction does not require Drp1's GTPase activity (Zhao2011Human). MIEF1 can also interact with hFis1, a fission-promoting protein, and this interaction is independent of its interaction with Drp1 (Zhao2011Human). Elevated levels of MIEF1 prevent the interaction of hFis1 with Mfn1/2, alleviating hFis1-induced mitochondrial fragmentation (Yu2021MIEF12). These interactions highlight MIEF1's role as a central hub in balancing mitochondrial fission and fusion, interacting with key components of both processes (Yu2021MIEF12).
