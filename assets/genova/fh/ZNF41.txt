# ZNF41

## Overview
ZNF41 is a gene located on the X chromosome that encodes the zinc finger protein 41, a member of the C2H2-type zinc finger protein family. This protein functions primarily as a transcription factor, characterized by its ability to bind specific DNA sequences and regulate gene expression. The zinc finger protein 41 contains a KRAB/FPB domain, which is a potent transcriptional repression domain, and 18 Krüppel-type zinc finger motifs that facilitate DNA binding (Rosati1999Coding; Franzè1991Isolation). The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that may vary in their functional properties and influence transcriptional regulation (Rosati1999Coding). ZNF41 is expressed in various cell types and is subject to X-inactivation, restricting its expression to active X chromosomes (Rosati1999Coding; Franzè1991Isolation). Mutations in ZNF41 have been associated with X-linked intellectual disability, highlighting its clinical significance in neurodevelopmental disorders (AlNaama2020C2H2Type).

## Structure
The ZNF41 gene encodes a zinc finger protein characterized by the presence of a KRAB/FPB domain, which is a potent transcriptional repression domain. This domain is composed of two adjacent elements, A and B, with the A module being primarily responsible for transcriptional repression (Rosati1999Coding). The protein structure includes 18 Krüppel-type zinc finger motifs, which are typical of the C2H2 type, forming loop-like structures through the interaction of cysteines and histidines with a zinc ion (Franzè1991Isolation). These motifs are crucial for DNA binding and are commonly found in regulatory proteins (Franzè1991Isolation).

Alternative splicing of ZNF41 mRNAs results in several isoforms, which differ in their coding sequence content upstream of the KRAB/FPB-A module. These isoforms, labeled ZNF41.1 to ZNF41.8, vary in their N-terminal regions and the presence or absence of KRAB/FPB modules, affecting the protein's structure and function. For example, ZNF41.4 lacks both KRAB/FPB-A and KRAB/FPB-B modules, potentially altering its repressive activity (Rosati1999Coding). Some variants, such as ZNF41.5 and ZNF41.6, contain phosphorylation sites, which may influence the protein's activity (Rosati1999Coding).

## Function
ZNF41 is a zinc finger protein that functions primarily as a transcription factor, playing a crucial role in regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. The protein contains KRAB/FPB domains, which are potent transcriptional repression domains, suggesting its involvement in transcriptional repression activities (Rosati1999Coding). The KRAB/FPB domain is composed of two elements, A and B, with the A module being primarily responsible for repression (Rosati1999Coding).

ZNF41 is expressed in various cell types, indicating its role in diverse cellular contexts (Franzè1991Isolation). The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple mRNA variants that may differ in their functional properties, potentially influencing their roles in transcriptional regulation and cellular function (Rosati1999Coding). These variants can lead to frameshifts affecting the inclusion of KRAB/FPB domains, which may alter the protein's repression activity (Rosati1999Coding).

The presence of zinc finger motifs in ZNF41 suggests its involvement in DNA binding, which is a common feature of proteins that regulate gene expression (Franzè1991Isolation). ZNF41 is located on the X chromosome and is subject to X-inactivation, meaning its expression is restricted to active X chromosomes (Rosati1999Coding).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZNF41 gene have been implicated in X-linked intellectual disability (XLID), a genetic disorder characterized by cognitive impairments that are more pronounced in affected males due to its X-linked recessive inheritance pattern (AlNaama2020C2H2Type). ZNF41 is part of a cluster of zinc finger genes on the X chromosome, which includes other genes like ZNF81 and ZNF674, also associated with intellectual disabilities (Lugtenberg2006ZNF674:). These genes are involved in transcriptional regulation, and mutations can disrupt normal brain development and function, leading to neurodevelopmental disorders (AlNaama2020C2H2Type).

The clinical significance of ZNF41 mutations is highlighted by their association with specific phenotypes among approximately 200 candidate genes for XLID (AlNaama2020C2H2Type). Although the exact mechanisms by which ZNF41 mutations lead to intellectual disability are not fully understood, it is suggested that alterations in its expression or interactions may impact neurological development, contributing to cognitive impairments (AlNaama2020C2H2Type). The involvement of ZNF41 in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining normal cognitive function and highlights the potential consequences of its dysregulation.
