# SLC10A5

## Overview
SLC10A5 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 10 member 5, which is part of the solute carrier (SLC) family of proteins. These proteins are typically involved in the transport of various molecules across cellular membranes. While the specific function of SLC10A5 is not fully elucidated, it is categorized as a transmembrane protein, suggesting a role in the transport of bile acids or other substrates across the cell membrane. The SLC10 family is known for its involvement in the transport of bile acids, steroidal compounds, and other organic anions, which are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and metabolic processes (Qiu2020aarFDC).
