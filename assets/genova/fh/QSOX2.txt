# QSOX2

## Overview
QSOX2, or quiescin sulfhydryl oxidase 2, is a gene that encodes a multidomain enzyme involved in the formation of disulfide bonds, which are essential for protein folding and stability. The protein encoded by QSOX2 is categorized as a sulfhydryl oxidase and is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, where it contributes to oxidative protein folding. This enzyme plays a significant role in various biological processes, including the growth hormone signaling pathway, mitochondrial dynamics, and immune system function. QSOX2 exists in two isoforms, which result from alternative splicing and have distinct functional roles and tissue distributions. The protein's activity involves complex electron transfer events facilitated by its thioredoxin and Erv/ALR domains. Alterations in QSOX2 expression or function have been implicated in several health conditions, including growth failure, immune dysfunction, and cancer progression (Kuo2017Identification; LimorWaisberg2013Diversification; Storr2023QSOX2).

## Structure
QSOX2, or quiescin sulfhydryl oxidase 2, is a protein involved in the formation of disulfide bonds, crucial for protein folding and stability. The protein is characterized by the presence of two thioredoxin domains at the N-terminus, a helix-rich region, and a C-terminal Erv/ALR domain, which serves as the oxidative site for catalysis (Kuo2017Identification). The thioredoxin domains contain a redox-active CXXC motif, which is essential for electron transfer (LimorWaisberg2013Diversification). The Erv domain also features a redox-active di-cysteine motif and interacts with a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor, facilitating the electron transfer process (LimorWaisberg2013Diversification).

QSOX2 exists in two isoforms: a long form (~75 kDa) with a transmembrane domain and a short form (~50 kDa) that lacks this domain, suggesting a secretory role (Kuo2017Identification; Li2021QSOX2). The presence of these isoforms indicates alternative splicing events that result in different functional roles and tissue distributions (Kuo2017Identification). The protein may also undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can affect its stability and function.

## Function
QSOX2 (quiescin sulfhydryl oxidase 2) is a multidomain enzyme involved in the formation of disulfide bonds, which are crucial for protein folding and stability. It is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, contributing to oxidative protein folding, a process essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper protein function (LimorWaisberg2013Diversification; Storr2023QSOX2). 

In healthy human cells, QSOX2 plays a significant role in the growth hormone (GH) signaling pathway by regulating the stabilization and import of phosphorylated-STAT5B, a key effector in this pathway. This regulation is crucial for the production of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), a growth-promoting factor, thereby influencing human growth and development (Storr2023QSOX2). 

QSOX2 is also involved in modulating mitochondrial dynamics and is essential for the proper functioning of the immune system and gastrointestinal tract. Its absence or deficiency can lead to growth failure, immune dysfunction, and gastrointestinal issues (Storr2023QSOX2). The enzyme's activity involves a series of electron transfer events, where electrons are accepted from the substrate by the CXXC motif of the QSOX Trx1 domain and transferred to the sulfhydryl oxidase module, ultimately reaching molecular oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor (LimorWaisberg2013Diversification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the QSOX2 gene have been linked to several health conditions. QSOX2 deficiency is associated with a unique syndrome characterized by short stature, immune dysfunction, atopic eczema, and gastrointestinal pathology. This deficiency disrupts growth hormone-mediated STAT5B nuclear translocation, leading to growth hormone-induced mitochondriopathy and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential in patient-derived dermal fibroblasts. The deficiency impairs growth hormone-STAT5B downstream activities and mitochondrial dynamics, contributing to multisystem dysfunction (Storr2023QSOX2).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), QSOX2 expression is significantly upregulated and is associated with advanced clinicopathological features, such as pathological stage and lymph node metastasis. High QSOX2 levels predict poor overall survival and disease-free survival in CRC patients, serving as an independent prognostic factor. Inhibiting QSOX2 suppresses CRC cell proliferation and metastasis, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for prognosis prediction in CRC (Jiang2021Quiescin).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), QSOX2 is overexpressed and linked to poor survival in advanced-stage patients. Silencing QSOX2 in NSCLC cell lines inhibits cancer cell proliferation and induces apoptosis, indicating its role in tumor growth and as a potential serum biomarker for monitoring tumor progression (Li2021QSOX2).

## Interactions
QSOX2, a sulfhydryl oxidase, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, QSOX2 interacts with proteins such as PRRX2, which is part of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This interaction affects the expression of cell division-associated proteins like CENPF and NUSAP1 and influences the nuclear distribution of β-catenin, thereby playing a role in cell cycle regulation and tumor progression (Li2021QSOX2).

QSOX2 also interacts with STAT5B, a transcription factor involved in growth hormone (GH) signaling. This interaction is crucial for the nuclear localization and transcriptional activity of STAT5B. Variants in QSOX2, such as p.V325Wfs*26, disrupt this interaction, leading to impaired nuclear translocation of STAT5B and increased cytoplasmic accumulation. This disruption affects GH-induced STAT5B phosphorylation and its subsequent transcriptional activities, impacting growth and immune function (Storr2023QSOX2).

These interactions highlight QSOX2's role in modulating key signaling pathways and cellular functions, with implications for both cancer progression and growth hormone-mediated processes.
