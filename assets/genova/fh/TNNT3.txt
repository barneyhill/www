# TNNT3

## Overview
The TNNT3 gene encodes the fast skeletal muscle isoform of troponin T, a regulatory protein integral to the troponin complex, which is essential for muscle contraction in vertebrates. This protein, categorized as a structural component, plays a pivotal role in the calcium-mediated regulation of striated muscle contraction by linking the troponin complex to tropomyosin, thereby modulating the interaction between actin and myosin filaments. TNNT3 is predominantly expressed in fast-twitch skeletal muscle fibers, where it contributes to muscle strength and speed. The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that allow for developmental adaptation of muscle function. Mutations in TNNT3 are associated with various congenital muscle disorders, including distal arthrogryposis type 2B and nemaline myopathy with distal arthrogryposis, underscoring its clinical significance in muscle physiology and pathology (Sandaradura2018Nemaline; Stefancsik2003Structure; Wei2016TNNT1; Ju2013Troponin).

## Function
The TNNT3 gene encodes the fast skeletal muscle isoform of troponin T, a critical component of the troponin complex involved in muscle contraction regulation. This complex, which includes troponin C (TnC), troponin I (TnI), and troponin T (TnT), plays a key role in the calcium-mediated regulation of vertebrate striated muscle contraction. Troponin T, specifically, serves as a structural link between the troponin complex and tropomyosin, enhancing the cooperativity of actin-tropomyosin binding to myosin and contributing to calcium sensitivity in muscle fibers (Stefancsik2003Structure; Ju2013Troponin).

TNNT3 is primarily expressed in fast-twitch skeletal muscle fibers, where it forms part of the fast-twitch troponin complex along with TNNI2 and TNNC2. This expression is crucial for normal muscle function, influencing muscle strength and speed (Ju2013Troponin; Wei2016TNNT1). The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in various isoforms that are developmentally regulated, which allows for functional adaptation of skeletal muscles during development (Wei2016TNNT1). The TNNT3 protein is active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with other components of the troponin complex to facilitate muscle contraction (Stefancsik2003Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TNNT3 gene are associated with several congenital conditions, primarily affecting muscle function. Distal arthrogryposis type 2B (DA2B), also known as Sheldon-Hall syndrome, is a condition characterized by congenital contractures of the distal joints, such as the hands and feet. Specific mutations in TNNT3, like the missense mutations p.Arg63Cys and p.Arg63His, have been identified as pathogenic and are linked to DA2B (Dabaj2023Diagnostic; Beck2013Spectrum; Sung2003Mutations). These mutations can disrupt muscle function by altering the interaction with tropomyosin, leading to increased calcium ion concentration and muscle contractility issues (Dabaj2023Diagnostic).

TNNT3 mutations have also been implicated in nemaline myopathy with distal arthrogryposis (NM-DA), a severe congenital myopathy characterized by muscle weakness and the presence of nemaline rods in muscle biopsies. A homozygous essential splice variant in TNNT3 was identified as a likely cause of this condition, highlighting the gene's role in muscle development and function (Sandaradura2018Nemaline).

The genetic heterogeneity of these conditions suggests that TNNT3 mutations can lead to a range of phenotypic outcomes, from isolated contractures to more complex myopathic disorders (Beck2013Spectrum).

## Interactions
The TNNT3 gene encodes the fast skeletal muscle isoform of troponin T, which is a critical component of the troponin complex involved in muscle contraction. TNNT3 interacts primarily with troponin I (TnI) and troponin C (TnC) within this complex. These interactions are essential for the regulation of muscle contraction and relaxation, as TnT serves as a structural link between the troponin complex and tropomyosin, facilitating the calcium sensitivity of striated muscle (Stefancsik2003Structure; Wei2016TNNT1).

The TNNT3 protein contains a conserved heptad repeat (HR) domain, which is involved in the dimerization with TnI through α-helical coiled-coil formations. This domain is conserved across various species, indicating its evolutionary importance in maintaining the structural integrity of the troponin complex (Stefancsik2003Structure).

Alternative splicing of TNNT3 results in different isoforms that can affect its interactions. For instance, the inclusion of exon 17 in embryonic and neonatal isoforms weakens the binding of TNNT3 to TnC and tropomyosin, altering the protein's interaction dynamics (Wei2016TNNT1). These interactions are crucial for the proper function of the troponin complex in muscle contraction.
