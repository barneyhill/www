# GAS2L3

## Overview
GAS2L3 is a gene that encodes the protein growth arrest specific 2 like 3, which plays a crucial role in cell division, particularly during cytokinesis. The GAS2L3 protein is categorized as a microtubule and actin-binding protein, facilitating the cross-linking of these cytoskeletal components to ensure proper cell division and structural integrity. It is specifically expressed during mitosis and is regulated by the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) Cdh1 complex, which targets it for degradation to maintain appropriate levels throughout the cell cycle. The protein's interactions with the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) and its localization to critical cellular structures during division underscore its importance in preventing cell division defects. Alterations in GAS2L3 expression have been linked to various cancers, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Fackler2014The; Zhou2021Elevated; Pe’er2013Gas2l3).

## Function
GAS2L3 is a protein involved in the regulation of cytokinesis, a critical phase of cell division. It functions as a microtubule and actin-binding protein, playing a role in the cross-linking of these cytoskeletal components during interphase and cell division (Zhou2021Elevated; Pe’er2013Gas2l3). GAS2L3 is specifically expressed during mitosis, where it localizes to the mitotic spindle in metaphase, the midbody during cytokinesis, and the constriction zone during abscission (Stopp2017Deletion). 

The protein is regulated by the APC/C Cdh1 complex, which targets it for degradation, ensuring its levels are appropriately modulated throughout the cell cycle (Pe’er2013Gas2l3). GAS2L3 interacts with the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) through its GAR domain, which is essential for its localization to the constriction zone during abscission, the final step of cell division (Fackler2014The). 

In healthy human cells, GAS2L3 is crucial for proper cytokinesis and cell division, preventing defects such as multinucleated cells and ensuring the correct separation of daughter cells (Fackler2014The). Its role in maintaining cellular structure and division integrity is vital for normal cell proliferation and organismal development (Stopp2017Deletion).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GAS2L3 gene have been implicated in various cancers, notably glioma and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In glioma, elevated GAS2L3 expression is associated with poor prognosis, correlating with shorter overall survival and adverse clinical features. High GAS2L3 expression is linked to higher-grade gliomas, older age, and wild-type IDH1 status, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Zhou2021Elevated). The gene's expression is also associated with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint markers, indicating its role in the tumor's immune microenvironment and potential as a predictive marker for immunotherapy response (Zhou2021Elevated).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, GAS2L3 is highly expressed in tumor tissues compared to non-tumor specimens. Its high expression levels are associated with poor clinical prognosis and are considered an independent prognostic factor for HCC patients. The gene's expression is negatively related to activated NK cells and regulatory T cells, suggesting its involvement in the tumor's immunological microenvironment (Gao2021Genetic; Xu2024A). These findings highlight GAS2L3's potential as a target for therapeutic intervention in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
GAS2L3 is a protein that interacts with components of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), which is crucial for mitosis and cytokinesis. It directly binds to the C-terminus of borealin and the N-terminus of survivin, two subunits of the CPC, through its conserved GAR domain. This interaction is essential for the localization of GAS2L3 to the constriction zone during cytokinesis (Fackler2014The). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have confirmed the association of GAS2L3 with Aurora B and survivin in HeLa cells, and GST pulldown experiments demonstrated that the GAR domain is necessary and sufficient for these interactions (Fackler2014The).

GAS2L3 also interacts with microtubules and actin filaments, acting as a cross-linker protein. It colocalizes with midzone microtubules and the midbody during telophase, associating with constriction sites where it interacts with the ESCRT-III complex components CHMP4b and Spastin, which are crucial for cell abscission (Pe’er2013Gas2l3). The protein is a substrate of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), which phosphorylates GAS2L3, but it is not phosphorylated by Aurora B (Fackler2014The). These interactions highlight GAS2L3's role in regulating cytokinesis and its involvement in the final steps of cell division.
