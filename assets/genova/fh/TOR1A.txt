# TOR1A

## Overview
The TOR1A gene encodes the protein torsin family 1 member A, commonly referred to as torsinA, which is a member of the AAA+ ATPase superfamily. This protein is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope, where it plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and integrity. TorsinA is involved in processes such as endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD), nuclear pore complex biogenesis, and synaptic vesicle trafficking. The protein's function is modulated by its interactions with cofactors like LAP1 and LULL1, which are essential for its ATPase activity. Mutations in the TOR1A gene, particularly the ΔE mutation, are linked to DYT1 dystonia, a neurological disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions and abnormal movements. This mutation disrupts torsinA's normal function, leading to the clinical manifestations of the disease (Fan2023DYTTOR1A; GonzalezAlegre2019Advances).

## Structure
The TOR1A gene encodes the torsinA protein, a member of the AAA+ ATPase superfamily, characterized by a conserved ATPase domain. TorsinA is a 332 amino acid protein with a signal peptide sequence, followed by a hydrophobic stretch and Walker A and B motifs, which are essential for ATP binding and hydrolysis (Rose2015Torsins:; GonzalezAlegre2019Advances). The protein's structure includes a wedge-shaped α/β RecA fold at the N-terminus and an α-helical domain at the C-terminus, which is involved in oligomerization (Rose2015Torsins:). TorsinA lacks the catalytic arginine residue typical of other AAA+ proteins, which affects its ATPase activity (Laudermilch2016Torsin).

TorsinA is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is anchored to the ER membrane via its N-terminal hydrophobic domain, which is crucial for ER retention (Rose2015Torsins:; GonzalezAlegre2019Advances). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, and its function is regulated by the redox state of conserved cysteines (GonzalezAlegre2019Advances). TorsinA forms homo- or hetero-hexamers, although its exact quaternary structure remains elusive (GonzalezAlegre2019Advances). The ΔE mutation in torsinA, associated with dystonia, affects its interaction with cofactors LAP1 and LULL1, which are necessary for its activation (Demircioglu2016Structures; Laudermilch2016Torsin).

## Function
The TOR1A gene encodes the protein TorsinA, which is a member of the AAA+ ATPase family. TorsinA is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and nuclear envelope (NE), where it plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. In healthy human cells, TorsinA is involved in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD), facilitating the retro-translocation and proteasomal degradation of misfolded proteins, such as the mutant cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR∆F508) (Nery2011TorsinA). It interacts with proteins like Derlin-1, VImP, and p97, which are essential for its function in ERAD (Nery2011TorsinA).

TorsinA also contributes to the integrity of the nuclear envelope and is implicated in the biogenesis of the nuclear pore complex (Rampello2020The). It requires interaction with cofactors such as LAP1 and LULL1 to stimulate its ATPase activity, which is necessary for its function (Rampello2020The). TorsinA's role extends to cellular lipid metabolism and synaptic vesicle trafficking, where it may regulate the recycling of synaptic vesicles involved in neurotransmitter excretion (Groen2013Is). These functions are critical for normal neurological development and cellular stress responses (Nery2011TorsinA; GonzalezAlegre2019Advances).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TOR1A gene, which encodes the protein torsinA, are primarily associated with DYT1 dystonia, a form of early-onset torsion dystonia. The most common mutation is a 3 base pair (GAG) deletion, resulting in the loss of a glutamic acid residue in torsinA, leading to the torsinA(ΔE) variant. This mutation is linked to involuntary muscle contractions and abnormal movements, often beginning in childhood (Fan2023DYTTOR1A; GonzalezAlegre2019Advances). DYT1 dystonia is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with reduced penetrance, affecting about 30% of carriers (Ozelius2011Genetic).

The ΔGAG mutation disrupts the function of torsinA, affecting synaptic vesicle recycling and dopamine release, which contributes to the motor symptoms observed in DYT1 dystonia (Ozelius2011Genetic; GonzalezAlegre2019Advances). Other rare mutations in TOR1A, such as p.R288Q and p.F205I, have also been associated with dystonia, though they are less common (Ozelius2011Genetic).

DYT-TOR1A dystonia may also involve non-motor symptoms, affecting motor learning, memory, and attention, with pathological changes observed in brain regions such as the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum (Fan2023DYTTOR1A). Environmental factors, such as psychological stress and trauma, can exacerbate symptoms (Fan2023DYTTOR1A).

## Interactions
TorsinA, encoded by the TOR1A gene, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its function. It interacts with LAP1 (lamina-associated polypeptide 1) and LULL1 (luminal domain-like LAP1), which are essential for its ATPase activity. These proteins act as cofactors, providing a catalytic arginine residue necessary for ATP hydrolysis (Demircioglu2016Structures; GonzalezAlegre2019Advances). The DYT1 mutation in TorsinA disrupts its interaction with LAP1 and LULL1, leading to impaired ATPase activity and is associated with primary dystonia (Demircioglu2016Structures; Rampello2020The).

TorsinA also interacts with proteins involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, such as Derlin-1, VCP/p97, VIMP, and FBG1, and binds to the main lumenal chaperone BiP and calnexin in the ER (GonzalezAlegre2019Advances). It associates with the inner nuclear membrane protein SUN1 and the luminal KASH domain of nesprins, components of the LINC complexes, suggesting a role in nuclear envelope dynamics (Chalfant2019Expression; GonzalezAlegre2019Advances).

In a yeast model, TorsinA interacts with the SUN-domain protein Mps3 and Pom152, a nucleoporin, indicating potential roles in nuclear pore complex biogenesis and spindle pole body interactions (Chalfant2019Expression). These interactions are disrupted in the TorsinA-ΔE mutant, providing insights into the nuclear envelope abnormalities seen in dystonia (Chalfant2019Expression).
