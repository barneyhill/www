# RBM28

## Overview
RBM28 is a gene that encodes the RNA binding motif protein 28, a nucleolar protein involved in RNA processing and ribosome biogenesis. The protein is characterized by its RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), which enable it to bind RNA and participate in the maturation of pre-ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and the assembly of ribonucleoprotein complexes. Functionally, RNA binding motif protein 28 is integral to the nucleolar stress response and interacts with key cellular regulators, such as the tumor suppressor p53, modulating its transcriptional activity. This interaction is significant in maintaining cellular homeostasis and has implications in tumorigenesis. Mutations in the RBM28 gene are associated with Alopecia, Neurological and Endocrinopathy syndrome (ANE syndrome), and its dysregulation is implicated in colorectal cancer progression, highlighting its clinical significance (Xu2024USP36; Castello2013RNAbinding).

## Structure
RBM28 (RNA binding motif protein 28) is a nucleolar protein involved in RNA processing. It contains RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) that facilitate its RNA-binding capabilities (Castello2013RNAbinding). The primary structure of RBM28 consists of amino acid sequences that form these RRMs, which are crucial for its function in RNA binding and processing. The secondary structure of RBM28 typically includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which are common in proteins with RNA recognition motifs.

The tertiary structure of RBM28 involves the three-dimensional folding of these motifs, allowing it to interact effectively with RNA molecules. Although specific details about the quaternary structure of RBM28 are not provided, it is known to interact with other proteins, which may suggest a role in larger protein complexes involved in RNA processing (Chetta2022An).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in the function and localization of RBM28. For instance, phosphorylation can lead to the translocation of RBM28 from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm, where it interacts with the DNA-binding domain of tumor suppressor p53, inhibiting its transcriptional activity (Xu2024USP36; Sanya2022Roles). These modifications are crucial for its role in cellular processes and disease mechanisms.

## Function
RBM28 is a nucleolar protein involved in the biogenesis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and the assembly of ribonucleoprotein complexes. It plays a crucial role in the processing and maturation of pre-rRNA, which is essential for ribosome production and protein synthesis. RBM28 is primarily active in the nucleolus of the cell, where it contributes to the nucleolar stress response and is a component of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) (Xu2024USP36).

In healthy human cells, RBM28 is involved in the regulation of RNA stability and splicing, impacting gene expression and cellular function. It interacts with the DNA-binding domain of the tumor suppressor p53, modulating its transcriptional activity, which is significant in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis (Sanya2022Roles). Although its specific functions in healthy cells are not fully detailed, RBM28's role in RNA processing and interaction with p53 suggests it is crucial for normal cellular operations and stress responses (Xu2024USP36). The protein's activity in the nucleolus underscores its importance in ribosome biogenesis, a fundamental process for cell growth and proliferation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RBM28 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. Notably, mutations in RBM28 are linked to Alopecia, Neurological and Endocrinopathy syndrome (ANE syndrome), which is characterized by growth retardation, impaired motor skills, mental retardation, hair loss, and skeletal and skin abnormalities (Castello2013RNAbinding; Robson2016Expression). The specific mutation L351P in RBM28 has been identified as causing aberrant protein function, contributing to these clinical manifestations (Castello2013RNAbinding).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), RBM28 plays a significant role in disease progression. The gene is upregulated in CRC tissues, and its expression correlates with poor overall survival, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for CRC prognosis (Xu2024USP36). RBM28 interacts with USP36, a deubiquitinase, which stabilizes RBM28 and leads to the inactivation of the p53 signaling pathway, facilitating CRC cell proliferation and metastasis (Xu2024USP36). This interaction highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting the USP36/RBM28/p53 axis in CRC treatment (Xu2024USP36). The clinical significance of RBM28 is underscored by its involvement in both genetic syndromes and cancer, indicating its critical role in maintaining normal cellular functions.

## Interactions
RBM28 is known to interact with several proteins and plays a significant role in the regulation of the p53 signaling pathway. It binds to the DNA-binding region of the p53 protein, suppressing its transcriptional activity. This interaction is crucial for the USP36-mediated inhibition of the p53 signaling pathway, which is important in colorectal cancer progression (Xu2024USP36). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have confirmed the interaction between RBM28 and p53 in colorectal cancer cells, and immunofluorescence assays have demonstrated their nuclear co-localization (Xu2024USP36).

RBM28 is also a substrate of USP36, a deubiquitinating enzyme that stabilizes RBM28 by preventing its degradation. This stabilization occurs through deubiquitylation at the K162 residue, which is crucial for RBM28's function in inhibiting p53 transcriptional activity (Xu2024USP36). The interaction between USP36 and RBM28 has been validated through co-immunoprecipitation and GST-pulldown assays, with the USP domain of USP36 and the RRM2 domain of RBM28 mediating this interaction (Xu2024USP36). These interactions highlight RBM28's role in modulating p53 activity and its involvement in cancer progression.
