# ZNF486

## Overview
ZNF486 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 486, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger domains, which are small protein structural motifs that can bind to DNA, RNA, or other proteins. Zinc finger protein 486 is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, by interacting with specific DNA sequences to modulate gene expression. The precise biological functions and pathways involving ZNF486 are still under investigation, but its role in gene regulation suggests it may be significant in developmental and cellular processes (Qiu2020aarFDC).
