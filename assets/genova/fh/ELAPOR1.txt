# ELAPOR1

## Overview
ELAPOR1 is a gene that encodes the protein endosome-lysosome associated apoptosis and autophagy regulator 1, which plays a critical role in cellular processes such as apoptosis and autophagy. This protein is primarily associated with endosomes and lysosomes, where it regulates the degradation and recycling of cellular components, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and integrity (BenMahmoud2022A). As a regulator of macroautophagy, ELAPOR1 is essential for the removal of damaged organelles and proteins, particularly under conditions of cellular stress (Fan2021Identification). The gene is highly expressed in the brain, suggesting its involvement in neurodevelopmental processes and its potential role in neurodevelopmental disorders (BenMahmoud2022A). Additionally, ELAPOR1 has been implicated in cancer biology, with altered expression patterns observed in certain cancer types, such as oral squamous cell carcinoma (Kuk2024Prognostic).

## Function
ELAPOR1, also known as endosome-lysosome associated apoptosis and autophagy regulator 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in regulating apoptosis and autophagy, which are crucial processes for maintaining cellular homeostasis and survival. The protein is active in endosomes and lysosomes, where it influences cellular degradation pathways and the removal of damaged organelles, impacting cellular health and organismal development (BenMahmoud2022A).

In healthy human cells, ELAPOR1 plays a significant role in macroautophagy, a process where cellular components are degraded and recycled. This function is particularly important in the context of cellular stress and damage, as it helps maintain cellular integrity by removing dysfunctional organelles and proteins (Fan2021Identification). The protein's involvement in these pathways suggests its importance in regulating cell survival and preventing the accumulation of cellular debris, which could otherwise lead to cellular dysfunction or disease.

ELAPOR1 has also been implicated in neurodevelopmental processes, with high expression observed in the adult and fetal brain. This expression pattern suggests a potential role in early neurodevelopmental phenotypes, although the specific functions in healthy cells remain to be fully elucidated (BenMahmoud2022A).

## Clinical Significance
ELAPOR1 has been implicated in various neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) due to its genetic variants and interactions with other genes involved in these conditions. It is considered a likely candidate gene for NDDs, including developmental disorders (DD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as four genetic variants in ELAPOR1 have been reported in individuals with these conditions (BenMahmoud2022A). Knockout mice studies have shown that the absence of ELAPOR1 leads to decreased exploration in new environments, suggesting its role in neurodevelopmental processes (BenMahmoud2022A).

ELAPOR1 is also noted for its high expression in the adult and fetal brain, which implies its involvement in early neurodevelopmental phenotypes when mutated (BenMahmoud2022A). The gene's expression patterns in the brain, along with its interactions with other genes, support its potential pathogenicity in NDDs (BenMahmoud2022A).

In the context of cancer, ELAPOR1 is significantly downregulated in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) with perineural invasion (PNI), indicating a potential role in the progression of this cancer type (Kuk2024Prognostic). Additionally, ELAPOR1 is negatively correlated with CLDN6 in various cancers, although specific disease associations for ELAPOR1 mutations or expression changes are not detailed (Zhang2021Identification).
