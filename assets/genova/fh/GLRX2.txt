# GLRX2

## Overview
GLRX2 is a gene that encodes the protein glutaredoxin 2, a member of the glutaredoxin family, which is primarily involved in cellular redox regulation. Glutaredoxin 2 is a mitochondrial protein that plays a critical role in maintaining redox homeostasis and protecting cells from oxidative stress by catalyzing the reversible reduction of disulfide bonds in proteins through a monothiol mechanism (Gallogly2008Kinetic). The protein is characterized by a thioredoxin fold and contains a conserved active site motif, CSYC, which is essential for its redox activity (Johansson2007Reversible). Unique to glutaredoxin 2 is its ability to form a dimeric complex with a [2Fe-2S] cluster, which acts as a redox sensor, allowing the protein to respond to changes in the cellular redox environment (Johansson2007Reversible; Hashemy2007Oxidation). This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the inhibition of apoptosis and the regulation of mitochondrial respiratory chain components, highlighting its significance in cellular survival and function (Enoksson2005Overexpression; Gallogly2008Kinetic).

## Structure
The human GLRX2 protein, also known as glutaredoxin 2, is characterized by a thioredoxin fold, which includes a central mixed β-sheet flanked by α-helices (Johansson2007Reversible). The protein contains a conserved active site motif, CSYC, which is involved in its redox activity (Johansson2007Reversible; Gallogly2008Kinetic). GLRX2 has four cysteine residues organized into two pairs: Cys-37 and Cys-40, which are part of the active site, and Cys-28 and Cys-113, which form a disulfide bond that contributes to the protein's stability and resistance to oxidation (Johansson2007Reversible).

GLRX2 exists in both monomeric and dimeric forms. The monomeric form is enzymatically active, while the dimeric form is inactive due to the sequestration of the active site cysteine by a 2Fe-2S cluster (Johansson2007Reversible). This dimerization is a unique feature of GLRX2, distinguishing it from other glutaredoxins (Johansson2007Reversible).

The protein also has splice variant isoforms, Grx2a and Grx2b, which differ in their N-terminal regions and subcellular localizations, with Grx2a being mitochondrial and Grx2b found in the perinuclear region (Lundberg2001Cloning). These isoforms result from alternative splicing and contribute to the protein's functional diversity (Lundberg2001Cloning).

## Function
Glutaredoxin 2 (GLRX2) is a mitochondrial protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis and protecting cells from oxidative stress. It is involved in the deglutathionylation of protein-glutathione mixed disulfides, a process essential for maintaining redox balance and modulating protein activity (Gallogly2008Kinetic). GLRX2 operates through a monothiol mechanism, utilizing glutathione (GSH) as a cofactor to catalyze the reversible reduction of disulfide bonds in proteins (Gallogly2008Kinetic).

GLRX2 is distinct from its cytosolic counterpart, Grx1, due to its mitochondrial localization and its ability to remain active upon oxidation, which is crucial for its role in cellular defense against oxidative stress (Hashemy2007Oxidation). It contains a [2Fe-2S] cluster that acts as a redox sensor, allowing it to respond to changes in the redox environment (Hashemy2007Oxidation). This protein is involved in preventing apoptosis by inhibiting cytochrome c release and caspase activation, thereby contributing to cell survival under stress conditions (Enoksson2005Overexpression).

GLRX2 also influences mitochondrial respiratory chain components, affecting electron transfer efficiency and reactive oxygen species production, which underscores its role in mitochondrial redox regulation and cellular viability (Gallogly2008Kinetic).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GLRX2 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), GLRX2 expression is notably diminished in the axonal processes of hippocampal sections in AD patients, suggesting its involvement in disease progression through the control of protein glutathionylation. Overexpression of GLRX2 in ALS models can prevent cell death induced by mutant SOD1, highlighting its protective role against oxidative damage at the mitochondria (Ogata2021Glutaredoxin:).

In Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), GLRX2 is implicated in mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. The mitochondrial isoform Glrx2a shows increased expression in cardiac muscle, possibly as a response to deficient mitochondrial respiration. Inhibition of GLRX2 decreases mitochondrial complex I and aconitase activities, indicating its role in maintaining mitochondrial function (SecoCervera2020Thioredoxin).

GLRX2 is also involved in cancer, particularly in lung cancer, where a decrease in its expression is associated with increased cell proliferation. This suggests a role in protecting mitochondrial proteins and regulating cell growth (Ogata2021Glutaredoxin:). In mice, the absence of GLRX2 leads to heart hypertrophy and fibrosis, and in humans, low levels of GLRX2 transcripts are associated with similar cardiac conditions, underscoring its importance in heart physiology (Ogata2021Glutaredoxin:).

## Interactions
GLRX2, or glutaredoxin 2, is involved in several interactions with other proteins, primarily through its role in redox regulation. It forms a dimeric or tetrameric holo-complex with an Fe2S2 cluster, which acts as a redox sensor. This complex can disassemble to activate GLRX2, allowing it to catalyze reversible glutathionylation of mitochondrial membrane proteins (Trnka2020Molecular). GLRX2 also interacts with thioredoxin reductase, receiving electrons to remain active under oxidizing conditions (Berndt2021Glutaredoxins). 

In the context of apoptosis, GLRX2 interacts with cytochrome c and cardiolipin, inhibiting cytochrome c release and caspase activation, which reduces susceptibility to apoptosis (Enoksson2005Overexpression). The protein's ability to detoxify nitric oxide by forming dinitrosyldiglutathionyl-iron complexes is another significant interaction, highlighting its role in redox sensing and protection against oxidative stress (Trnka2020Molecular).

GLRX2's interactions are not limited to stable complexes; it also participates in more transient interactions, such as those involved in protein deglutathionylation reactions, which are crucial for maintaining cellular redox balance (Johansson2007Reversible).
