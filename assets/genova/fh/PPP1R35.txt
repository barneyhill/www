# PPP1R35

## Overview
The PPP1R35 gene encodes the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 35, a centrosomal protein that plays a pivotal role in centriole elongation and centrosome biogenesis. This protein is categorized as a regulatory subunit, although its function at the centrosome is independent of its interaction with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) (Fong2018PPP1R35; Sydor2018PPP1R35). PPP1R35 is localized to the proximal lumen of the centriole, where it is essential for recruiting the microtubule-binding elongation machinery necessary for centriole elongation (Sydor2018PPP1R35). It operates within the CPAP-CEP120-SPICE pathway, promoting centriole elongation, and interacts with proteins such as Rotatin (RTTN) and CEP295, which are crucial for centriole biogenesis and centrosome functionality (Fong2018PPP1R35; Sydor2018PPP1R35). Mutations in PPP1R35 have been linked to developmental disorders, including autosomal recessive primary microcephaly, highlighting its significance in brain development and cellular processes (Massey2024Novel; Archambault2020Protein).

## Function
PPP1R35 is a centrosomal protein that plays a crucial role in centriole elongation and centrosome biogenesis in human cells. It is localized to the proximal lumen of the centriole, where it is essential for recruiting the microtubule-binding elongation machinery necessary for centriole elongation (Sydor2018PPP1R35). PPP1R35 operates within the CPAP-CEP120-SPICE pathway, promoting centriole elongation, and is not involved in the CP110-CEP97 pathway, which restricts elongation (Sydor2018PPP1R35).

The protein forms a complex with the microcephaly protein RTTN, which is important for centriole biogenesis. This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of proteins like CEP295, POC1B, and POC5, which are essential for proper centriole elongation (Sydor2018PPP1R35). PPP1R35 is also involved in centriole-to-centrosome conversion, acting upstream of CEP295 to ensure the stabilization and conversion of newborn centrioles into centrosomes (Fong2018PPP1R35).

Despite being annotated as a PP1-regulatory protein, the interaction with PP1 is not critical for its role at the centrosome, indicating that PPP1R35's function in centriole biogenesis is independent of its PP1-regulatory activity (Fong2018PPP1R35; Sydor2018PPP1R35).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PPP1R35 gene are associated with several developmental disorders, particularly those affecting brain size and function. Notably, PPP1R35 mutations have been linked to autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH), a condition characterized by a significantly reduced brain size, intellectual disability, and developmental delays (Massey2024Novel; Archambault2020Protein). In consanguineous families, severe microcephaly has been observed in individuals with homozygous mutations in PPP1R35, suggesting its critical role in brain development (Hu2018Genetics).

PPP1R35 is also implicated in congenital ciliopathies, which can lead to a range of developmental issues, including intellectual disability and global developmental delay (Massey2024Novel). The gene's role in ciliogenesis and centrosome function is crucial for proper neurogenesis and neuronal maturation, and its dysfunction can result in severe morphological defects, such as the absence of primary cilia (Massey2024Novel; Archambault2020Protein).

Research indicates that PPP1R35 interacts with other proteins involved in centriole and centrosome regulation, such as Rotatin (RTTN) and CEP131. These interactions are essential for centriole elongation and stability, and disruptions can lead to defects in cell cycle progression and genomic stability (Fong2018PPP1R35; Sydor2018PPP1R35).

## Interactions
PPP1R35 is a centrosomal protein that interacts with several other proteins, playing a crucial role in centriole elongation and centrosome functionality. It forms a complex with the microcephaly protein Rotatin (RTTN), which is essential for centriole elongation and centrosome biogenesis. This interaction is critical for the recruitment of other proteins such as POC1B, POC5, and CEP295, which are involved in centriole elongation (Sydor2018PPP1R35). 

PPP1R35 is also involved in the CPAP-CEP120-SPICE pathway, impacting centriole length regulation. However, it does not affect the CP110-CEP97 pathway (Sydor2018PPP1R35). Despite being annotated as a PP1-regulatory protein, the study did not find significant interactions with PP1 isoforms, suggesting that PPP1R35's role at the centrosome may not depend on PP1 binding (Sydor2018PPP1R35).

Additionally, PPP1R35 interacts with CEP295, acting upstream in the centriole-to-centrosome conversion process. In PPP1R35 knockout cells, the absence of CEP295 from centrioles indicates its essential role in recruiting CEP295 to newborn centrioles (Fong2018PPP1R35). These interactions highlight PPP1R35's importance in maintaining centriole and centrosome integrity.
