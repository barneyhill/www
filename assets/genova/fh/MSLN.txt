# MSLN

## Overview
The MSLN gene encodes the protein mesothelin, a glycoprotein predominantly expressed on the surface of mesothelial cells and overexpressed in various malignancies, including mesothelioma and ovarian cancer. Mesothelin is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein that plays a role in cell adhesion and signaling pathways, although its precise physiological function in normal tissues remains unclear. Structurally, mesothelin is characterized by a solenoid structure with multiple helices, contributing to its interaction with other proteins, such as the cancer antigen CA-125. This interaction is significant in cancer biology, particularly in facilitating tumor cell adhesion and metastasis. Due to its restricted expression in normal tissues and overexpression in tumors, mesothelin is a promising target for cancer diagnostics and therapeutics, including immunotherapy approaches (Lv2019Mesothelin; Klampatsa2020Mesothelintargeted; Gubbels2006MesothelinMUC16).

## Structure
The mesothelin (MSLN) protein is a cell surface glycoprotein encoded by the MSLN gene, primarily expressed in mesothelial cells and overexpressed in various cancers. The MSLN precursor protein is cleaved by the endoprotease furin into a 40 kDa glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored mature mesothelin and a 31 kDa megakaryocyte-potentiating factor (MPF) (Zhan2023Structures). The mature mesothelin protein features a compact, right-handed solenoid structure composed of 24 short helices and connecting loops, forming a nine-layered spiral coil similar to ARM/HEAT family proteins (Zhan2023Structures). 

The protein contains three predicted N-glycosylation sites at positions N388, N488, and N515, which are crucial for its interaction with the tumor-associated cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) (Zhan2023Structures). The N-terminal half of mesothelin is conformationally rigid, while the C-terminal portion is more flexible, with a shedding-resistant fragment that interacts with monoclonal antibodies (Zhan2023Structures). The mesothelin ectodomain is characterized by short amphipathic helices forming a slightly bent, elongated structure with a hydrophobic core, stabilized by two disulfide bonds (Lin2023Novel). These structural features are essential for the development of therapeutic antibodies targeting mesothelin.

## Function
The MSLN gene encodes a precursor glycoprotein that is cleaved into two products: a soluble 31-KD N-terminal protein called megakaryocyte potentiating factor (MPF) and a 40-KD membrane-bound fragment known as mesothelin (MSLN) (Lv2019Mesothelin). Mesothelin is expressed at low levels in normal adult tissues, including mesothelial cells lining the pleura, pericardium, and peritoneum, as well as in epithelial cells on the surface of the ovary, tunica vaginalis, rete testis, and fallopian tubes (Lv2019Mesothelin; Melaiu2014MSLN).

In healthy human cells, the precise function of mesothelin remains unclear, although it is involved in cell adhesion and signaling pathways crucial for cell proliferation and survival (Lv2019Mesothelin). Mesothelin acts as a receptor for CA125, mediating cell adhesion, which is significant in cellular interactions (Lv2019Mesothelin). Despite its involvement in these processes, mesothelin appears to be a nonessential component in normal cells, as MSLN knockout mice do not exhibit abnormal development or reproduction (Lv2019Mesothelin; Melaiu2014MSLN). The protein's role in normal cellular processes is not fully understood, but it may contribute to tissue repair and immune response regulation (Lv2019Mesothelin).

## Clinical Significance
The MSLN gene, encoding the mesothelin protein, is clinically significant due to its overexpression in several cancers, including malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, and colorectal cancer. In MPM, mesothelin overexpression is linked to tumor invasion and progression, with soluble mesothelin-related peptides (SMRP) being explored as biomarkers for diagnosis, although their clinical utility is limited by interindividual variability (Garritano2014A; Goricar2020Evaluation; Nelson2011The). In ovarian cancer, high MSLN expression correlates with poor survival and is associated with immune-related and chemoresistant genes, suggesting its role in tumor progression and resistance to therapy (Li2022MSLN). 

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), MSLN contributes to tumor growth, metastasis, and resistance to apoptosis through pathways involving STAT3, NFκB, and PI3K/Akt (Montemagno2020From). MSLN expression in colorectal cancer is linked to immune evasion and poor patient outcomes, particularly in microsatellite stable tumors, where it may predict response to immunotherapy (Malla2024Mesothelin). Genetic variants in the MSLN gene, such as rs1057147, have been associated with increased cancer risk and altered SMRP levels, impacting diagnosis and prognosis (Garritano2014A; Abou‐El‐Naga2020Association).

## Interactions
Mesothelin (MSLN) is known for its high-affinity interaction with the mucin MUC16, also known as cancer antigen 125 (CA-125). This interaction is crucial in the context of ovarian cancer, where it facilitates cell adhesion and potentially contributes to peritoneal metastasis. The binding between mesothelin and MUC16 is dependent on the presence of N-linked glycans on MUC16, with a dissociation constant (Kd) of approximately 5-10 nM, indicating a strong affinity (Gubbels2006MesothelinMUC16). This interaction is similar to the initial binding of leukocytes to inflamed endothelium, suggesting a role in mediating stronger adhesive interactions (Gubbels2006MesothelinMUC16).

Mesothelin's interaction with MUC16 is implicated in the formation of multicellular spheroids in peritoneal fluid, which may play a role in metastasis (Gubbels2006MesothelinMUC16). The interaction also increases cellular resistance to anoikis and upregulates matrix metalloproteinases, which are important in cellular invasion and metastasis (Hassan2016Mesothelin). These properties make mesothelin a promising target for cancer therapies, including immunotherapy approaches (Klampatsa2020Mesothelintargeted).
