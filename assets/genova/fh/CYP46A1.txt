# CYP46A1

## Overview
CYP46A1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme cytochrome P450 family 46 subfamily A member 1 (CYP46A1), which is a crucial component of the cytochrome P450 superfamily involved in cholesterol metabolism within the brain. This enzyme is primarily responsible for the conversion of cholesterol to 24S-hydroxycholesterol, a process essential for maintaining cholesterol homeostasis by facilitating its removal from the brain (Pikuleva2021Cholesterol; Petrov2020Brain). CYP46A1 is predominantly expressed in neuronal tissues, including the cortex and hippocampus, and is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it influences various cellular processes such as neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity (Pikuleva2021Cholesterol). The enzyme's activity is linked to the regulation of neurosteroids and oxysterols, which play significant roles in brain signaling pathways (Pikuleva2021Cholesterol). Given its pivotal role in cholesterol metabolism, alterations in CYP46A1 expression or function have been associated with several neurological disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Han2019Therapeutic; Kacher2019CYP46A1).

## Structure
The human gene CYP46A1 encodes the enzyme cytochrome P450 46A1, which plays a crucial role in cholesterol metabolism in the brain. The molecular structure of CYP46A1 includes a primary sequence of amino acids that form the characteristic cytochrome P450 fold, consisting of 12 α-helices and several β-sheets, which is typical of the P450 superfamily (White2008Use). The tertiary structure of CYP46A1 is compact and globular, featuring a heme-binding domain essential for its enzymatic activity. This domain is involved in the hydroxylation of cholesterol to 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, a key step in cholesterol elimination from the brain (White2008Use).

The enzyme's structure was determined using crystallographic techniques, with the final model refined to a resolution of 1.9 Å, providing detailed insights into its conformation (White2008Use). The crystallization process involved the use of heavy-atom derivatives, such as NaI and CsCl, to aid in phasing and structure determination (White2008Use). The enzyme's isoelectric point (pI) of 9.1 suggests a preference for anion binding, which is consistent with the observed binding patterns of iodide ions to multiple sites on the protein (White2008Use). The structure of CYP46A1 has not been reported to include quaternary structure or specific post-translational modifications in the provided context.

## Function
CYP46A1, also known as cytochrome P450 46A1, is an enzyme primarily expressed in the brain, where it plays a crucial role in cholesterol metabolism. It catalyzes the conversion of cholesterol to 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24HC), facilitating the removal and turnover of cholesterol in the brain (Pikuleva2021Cholesterol; Petrov2020Brain). This process is essential for maintaining cholesterol homeostasis, as 24HC can cross the blood-brain barrier and enter systemic circulation for degradation in the liver (Pikuleva2021Cholesterol).

CYP46A1 is predominantly expressed in neurons, particularly in the cortex, hippocampus, dentate gyrus, and thalamus, and is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (Pikuleva2021Cholesterol). The enzyme's activity is linked to various cellular processes, including neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity, and long-term potentiation, which are crucial for cognitive functions (Pikuleva2021Cholesterol; Petrov2020Brain). It also influences gene expression, protein phosphorylation, and the regulation of the TrkB/PI3K/Akt pro-survival pathway, contributing to neuronal stress responses (Pikuleva2021Cholesterol).

In healthy cells, CYP46A1 ensures a balance in cholesterol levels, supporting synaptic function and maintaining membrane properties, which are vital for normal brain operations (Petrov2020Brain). Its activity is crucial for the production of neurosteroids and oxysterols, which are involved in various brain regulatory and signaling pathways (Pikuleva2021Cholesterol).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the CYP46A1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in neurological disorders. In glioblastoma (GBM), CYP46A1 expression is significantly reduced compared to normal brain tissue, correlating with higher tumor grades and poorer prognosis. The loss of CYP46A1 leads to cholesterol accumulation and dysregulated cholesterol homeostasis in GBM, suggesting that restoring its activity could be a therapeutic strategy (Han2019Therapeutic).

In neurodegenerative diseases, decreased CYP46A1 levels are observed in conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Huntington's disease (HD). In HD, restoring CYP46A1 expression in the striatum of mouse models alleviates disease phenotypes by regulating cholesterol metabolism and improving synaptic function (Kacher2019CYP46A1). In AD, CYP46A1 activity is protective against neurodegeneration, and its modulation is being explored in clinical trials to mitigate symptoms (Pikuleva2021Cholesterol).

CYP46A1 is also implicated in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), where its downregulation leads to disordered mitochondrial morphology and reduced mitochondrial function, highlighting its role in lipid metabolism (Si2020Identification). These findings underscore the potential of targeting CYP46A1 in various diseases linked to cholesterol metabolism dysregulation.

## Interactions
CYP46A1, a member of the cytochrome P450 family, is involved in cholesterol metabolism in the brain. It plays a crucial role in converting cholesterol to 24-hydroxycholesterol, facilitating cholesterol turnover and homeostasis. This enzyme is part of a network involved in biological oxidations and other metabolic processes, indicating potential interactions with other proteins in these pathways (Si2020Identification).

CYP46A1 interacts with neurotransmitter systems, particularly modulating the GluN2B subunit of NMDARs, which is crucial for long-term potentiation (LTP). This interaction suggests a reciprocal relationship where excitatory neurotransmission enhances CYP46A1 activity, which in turn boosts neurotransmission (Pikuleva2021Cholesterol). The enzyme's activity is influenced by compounds such as L-Glu and 24HC, which modulate its function and impact neurotransmission and brain plasticity (Pikuleva2021Cholesterol).

CYP46A1 also affects synaptic connectivity and signaling pathways in the brain. It enhances vesicle and endosome trafficking, specifically improving the transport of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tropomyosin-related kinase receptor B (TrkB) endosomes. This is achieved by increasing the mean velocities of BDNF vesicles and TrkB endosomes, as well as enhancing the localization of phospho-TrkB in active synapses (Kacher2019CYP46A1).
