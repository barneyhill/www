# SEC14L2

## Overview
SEC14L2 is a gene that encodes the SEC14-like lipid binding 2 protein, which is a member of the SEC14-like family known for its involvement in lipid metabolism and transport. This protein plays a pivotal role in maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis by facilitating the binding and transport of alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) and its phosphorylated form, alpha-tocopheryl phosphate, within the cytoplasm. As a lipid-binding protein, SEC14L2 is integral to the regulation of lipid signaling pathways, including the PI3K/Akt pathway, which influences various cellular processes such as gene expression, apoptosis, and enzyme activity regulation. The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase gamma (PI3Kc) and RAB family proteins, further underscore its regulatory functions in lipid signaling and cellular dynamics (Gong2019Sec14l3; Zingg2014Modulation).

## Function
The SEC14L2 gene encodes a protein involved in lipid metabolism and transport within cells, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis. This protein is part of the SEC14-like family, known for its role in phospholipid transfer and regulation of lipid signaling pathways. In healthy human cells, SEC14L2 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it facilitates the binding and transport of alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) and its phosphorylated form, alpha-tocopheryl phosphate. This activity is essential for modulating lipid exchange and phosphorylation processes, influencing signal transduction pathways such as the PI3K/Akt pathway, which is involved in gene expression regulation, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promoter activity (Zingg2014Modulation).

SEC14L2 also interacts with phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase gamma (PI3Kc), forming an inactive complex that can be dissociated by tocopherol, leading to the activation of PI3Kc. This interaction suggests a regulatory role in lipid signaling pathways, impacting processes like apoptosis and enzyme activity regulation (Zingg2014Modulation). The protein's function in healthy cells may involve enhancing the accessibility of lipophilic molecules to enzymes and membrane domains, thereby influencing cellular processes such as proliferation and apoptosis (Zingg2014Modulation).

## Clinical Significance
The SEC14L2 gene, also known as tocopherol-associated protein (TAP), has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In breast cancer, SEC14L2 expression is significantly reduced, particularly in invasive and high-grade tumors, suggesting a potential tumor suppressor role. This downregulation is associated with tumor grade but is independent of factors like age, tumor size, or lymph node metastasis (Wang2009Reduced). The mechanisms for this downregulation may include genetic mutations or deletions in the chromosome 22q12 region, where the gene is located, and methylation of its promoter region (Wang2009Reduced).

SEC14L2 is also involved in the Wnt/Ca2+ signaling pathway, where its dysfunction is linked to various human diseases, including breast and prostate cancer (Gong2017The). In endothelial cells, SEC14L2 is crucial for VEGF-induced signaling, affecting vasculature formation. Knockdown of SEC14L2 impairs endothelial cell migration and capillary-like tube formation, highlighting its role in vascular development (Gong2019Sec14l3). These findings underscore the clinical significance of SEC14L2 in cancer progression and vascular-related conditions.

## Interactions
SEC14L2, also known as tocopherol-associated protein (TAP1), is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with VEGFR2, a receptor tyrosine kinase crucial for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling. This interaction enhances VEGFR2 phosphorylation at Y1175, preventing its association with the phosphatase PTP1B and maintaining its active state, which is essential for VEGF signaling and trafficking (Gong2019Sec14l3).

SEC14L2 also interacts with RAB family proteins, specifically RAB4A and RAB5A, which are important for the internalization and recycling of VEGFR2. These interactions facilitate the GTP-bound active states of RAB proteins, enhancing VEGFR2 vesicle movement to early and recycling endosomes (Gong2019Sec14l3).

In the context of Wnt/Ca2+ signaling, SEC14L2 forms complexes with Frizzled (Fz), Dishevelled (Dvl), and phospholipase C (PLC) proteins. It interacts with human DVL1, DVL2, and DVL3, with the Sec14 domain being essential for these interactions. SEC14L2 also interacts with Plcd family members, specifically Plcd3b and Plcd4a, facilitating their recruitment to the plasma membrane (Gong2017The).
