# AKAP7

## Overview
AKAP7, or A-kinase anchoring protein 7, is a gene that encodes a member of the A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) family, which are pivotal in the spatial and temporal regulation of protein kinase A (PKA) signaling within cells. The protein product of AKAP7 is involved in anchoring PKA to specific subcellular locations, thereby facilitating precise signal transduction pathways. This protein is categorized as a scaffolding protein due to its role in organizing and localizing PKA and other signaling molecules. AKAP7 is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, brain, and lungs, where it plays critical roles in processes such as synaptic plasticity, cardiac function, and ion channel regulation. The gene produces multiple isoforms through alternative splicing, each with distinct cellular localizations and functions, contributing to its diverse physiological roles (Singh2015Analysis; Johnson2012Molecular).

## Structure
AKAP7, a member of the A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs), is characterized by its ability to bind the regulatory subunits of protein kinase A (PKA) through an amphipathic helix. This helix is crucial for the interaction with PKA-R subunits and is conserved across vertebrates (Johnson2012Molecular). The primary structure of AKAP7 includes a highly variable amino acid sequence in the PKA regulatory subunit binding domain, which forms the amphipathic helix with conserved hydrophobic residues (Johnson2012Molecular).

AKAP7 exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, including AKAP7α, β, γ, and δ. These isoforms differ in their cellular localization and function. AKAP7α and β are lipid-modified, directing them to the plasma membrane, while AKAP7γ and δ require additional protein-protein interactions for intracellular targeting (Singh2015Analysis). AKAP7γ can form homodimers and heterodimers with AKAP7δ, enhancing the phosphorylation of PKA substrates (Singh2015Analysis).

The AKAP7δ isoform is noted for its high-affinity interaction with PKA RII subunits, involving hydrophobic contacts, hydrogen bonds, and salt-bridges (Hundsrucker2006Highaffinity). The structural details of AKAP7's tertiary and quaternary structures are not provided in the available context.

## Function
AKAP7 (A-kinase anchoring protein 7) plays a critical role in the compartmentalization and localization of protein kinase A (PKA) within cells, facilitating specific signaling pathways. In the hippocampus, particularly in dentate granule cells (DGCs), AKAP7 is essential for anchoring PKA in axonal projections, which is crucial for synaptic plasticity and spatial discrimination. The targeted deletion of AKAP7 in these cells impairs spatial discrimination, highlighting its role in pattern separation behaviors (Jones2016Targeted).

In cardiac cells, AKAP7, specifically the δ/γ isoforms, is involved in the phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLB), a key regulator of calcium dynamics. This interaction is vital for maintaining normal cardiac function, as it influences the phosphorylation state of PLB, which in turn affects calcium uptake and cardiac muscle contraction and relaxation (Rigatti2015Phosphorylation). AKAP7δ/γ directs PKA-mediated phosphorylation of PLB, and this process is crucial for effective modulation of SERCA2a activity, impacting cardiac calcium handling (Rigatti2015Phosphorylation).

AKAP7 is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, brain, kidney, liver, and lung, where it regulates ion channel activity and signal transduction, contributing to the cellular response to hormones and other stimuli (Johnson2012Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the AKAP7 gene have been associated with several clinical conditions. A novel rare variant, AKAP7 Gln112Arg, has been identified in congenital arrhythmia and is frequently linked to drug-induced long QT syndrome (LQTS), a condition that affects cardiac repolarization and can lead to arrhythmias (Suryavanshi2018PolymorphismsMutations). Additionally, single nucleotide polymorphisms in AKAP7 have been associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), suggesting a potential role in neurological conditions (Suryavanshi2018PolymorphismsMutations).

In the context of cancer, AKAP7 has been found to be deleted in both primary tumors and metastases in some breast cancer patients, indicating its potential involvement in tumor progression and metastasis (Kjällquist2018Exome). The deletion of AKAP7 in these cases suggests that it may play a role in the regulation of cellular processes that are disrupted in cancer.

These findings highlight the significance of AKAP7 in various diseases, particularly in cardiovascular and neurological disorders, as well as its potential involvement in cancer. The gene's role in anchoring protein kinase A (PKA) to specific cellular locations is crucial for maintaining normal cellular signaling, and disruptions in this function can lead to disease.

## Interactions
AKAP7 interacts with various proteins, playing a significant role in cellular signaling. It binds to protein kinase C (PKC) isoenzymes, including PKCα, through high-affinity, multi-site interactions. This binding occurs at both the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of AKAP7γ, with dissociation constants of 13.5 nM and 27 nM, respectively. AKAP7α also binds PKC, albeit with a single binding site (Redden2012Spatiotemporal). Unlike other AKAPs, AKAP7 does not inhibit PKC activity, even at high concentrations, and can bind to multiple PKC isoenzymes from different classes (Redden2012Spatiotemporal).

AKAP7 also interacts with phospholamban (PLB), particularly through its δ and γ isoforms. This interaction is phosphorylation state-dependent, enhancing PLB phosphorylation by anchoring protein kinase A (PKA) to PLB. Mutations in PLB that disrupt this interaction are linked to cardiac dysfunctions like dilated cardiomyopathy (Rigatti2015Phosphorylation).

AKAP7γ can form homodimers and heterodimers with AKAP7δ, but does not associate with other AKAPs such as mAKAP or AKAP79. This self-association is specific to AKAP7γ and involves multiple high-affinity binding sites (Singh2015Analysis).
