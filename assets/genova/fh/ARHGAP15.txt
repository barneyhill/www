# ARHGAP15

## Overview
ARHGAP15 is a gene that encodes the protein Rho GTPase activating protein 15, which functions as a Rho GTPase-activating protein (GAP). This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of Rac GTPases, particularly Rac1 and Rac2, which are critical for various cellular processes such as actin cytoskeletal dynamics, cell adhesion, and cell polarity (Seoh2003ArhGAP15; Costa2011The). ARHGAP15 is characterized by the presence of a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and a RhoGAP domain, which are essential for its localization and activity. The protein plays a significant role in modulating immune cell functions, particularly in neutrophils and macrophages, and is also crucial for maintaining neuronal architecture and function (Zamboni2016Disruption). Dysregulation of ARHGAP15 has been linked to various clinical conditions, including neurological disorders and cancer, highlighting its importance in both normal physiology and disease states (Liaci2022Loss; Pan2018Decreased).

## Function
The ARHGAP15 gene encodes a RhoGAP protein that plays a critical role in regulating the activity of Rac GTPases, particularly Rac1 and Rac2, in various cell types. In healthy human cells, ARHGAP15 functions as a negative regulator of Rac1, a member of the Rho family of GTPases involved in actin cytoskeletal dynamics, cell adhesion, and cell polarity (Seoh2003ArhGAP15; Costa2011The). The protein contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and a RhoGAP domain, which are essential for its localization to the cell periphery and its specific activity towards Rac1 (Seoh2003ArhGAP15).

ARHGAP15 is involved in modulating immune cell functions, particularly in neutrophils and macrophages. It acts as a master negative regulator of neutrophil functions, influencing chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and the respiratory burst, which are key components of the immune response (Costa2011The). In neurons, ARHGAP15 is crucial for maintaining the balance between excitatory and inhibitory synapses, affecting processes such as migration, neuritogenesis, and synaptic formation (Zamboni2016Disruption). The protein's regulation of Rac1 activity is essential for proper neuronal architecture and function, with its disruption linked to cognitive impairments and neurological disorders (Zamboni2016Disruption).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the ARHGAP15 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In neurological conditions, the loss of ARHGAP15 is associated with severe intellectual disability and a rare variant of Mowat-Wilson syndrome, characterized by epilepsy. A synonymous de novo mutation in ARHGAP15 has also been identified in patients with sporadic autism spectrum disorders. The absence of ARHGAP15 affects the directional control of migrating cortical interneurons in the embryonic cortex, leading to increased susceptibility to epilepsy due to hyperactive RAC1, which disrupts actin cytoskeleton dynamics (Liaci2022Loss).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), decreased expression of ARHGAP15 promotes tumor development through the PTEN/AKT/FOXO1 signaling pathway. This downregulation is linked to advanced clinical stages, larger tumor size, metastasis, and reduced overall survival in CRC patients. ARHGAP15 acts as a tumor suppressor, and its overexpression inhibits cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Pan2018Decreased).

In gastric cancer, ARHGAP15 is upregulated in metastatic lymph nodes, suggesting a pro-metastatic role. It enhances metastatic colonization by inactivating RAC1, reducing reactive oxygen species accumulation, and increasing the antioxidant capacity of tumor cells, which aids in their survival under oxidative stress (Zhang2023ARHGAP15).

## Interactions
ARHGAP15 interacts primarily with the GTPase RAC1, a member of the Rho family of GTPases. This interaction is crucial for ARHGAP15's function as a Rho GTPase-activating protein (GAP), specifically targeting RAC1 to regulate its activity. ARHGAP15 binds to RAC1 through a conserved central motif, and this interaction is not dependent on the nucleotide state of RAC1, meaning it can bind to both GTP- and GDP-bound forms of RAC1 (Seoh2003ArhGAP15). The C-terminal half of RAC1 is required for binding with ARHGAP15, a feature shared with related proteins like ARHGAP12 (Seoh2003ArhGAP15).

ARHGAP15's interaction with RAC1 is significant in various cellular processes, including the regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. By inhibiting RAC1 activity, ARHGAP15 decreases intracellular ROS, which is crucial for protecting cells from oxidative stress (Zhang2023ARHGAP15). In the context of cancer, ARHGAP15's interaction with RAC1 has been shown to influence metastatic colonization in gastric cancer by modulating the RAC1-ROS pathway (Zhang2023ARHGAP15).

In neuronal cells, ARHGAP15 negatively regulates RAC1, affecting actin cytoskeleton dynamics and neuronal migration. The loss of ARHGAP15 leads to hyperactive RAC1, resulting in abnormal actin dynamics and altered migration trajectories of cortical interneurons (Liaci2022Loss).
