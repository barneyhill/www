# APOL2

## Overview
APOL2 is a gene that encodes the protein apolipoprotein L2, a member of the apolipoprotein L family, which is primarily involved in lipid transport and cellular stress responses. Apolipoprotein L2 is characterized by a non-classical four-helix bundle motif in its N-terminal domain, a structural feature it shares with other family members such as ApoL1 (Ultsch2021Structures). Unlike typical BH3-only proteins, apolipoprotein L2 does not bind to pro-survival Bcl-2 family proteins, suggesting a unique role in cell death pathways (Ultsch2021Structures). The protein is implicated in regulating autophagy and managing endoplasmic reticulum stress, particularly in response to inflammatory cytokines (Pays2020The; PazBarba2023Apolipoprotein). APOL2's expression is upregulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, indicating its potential involvement in immune-related functions (Ultsch2021Structures). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its association with various diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and cardiovascular diseases, where it influences cellular stress responses and inflammation.

## Structure
The APOL2 protein, a member of the apolipoprotein L family, features a non-classical four-helix bundle motif in its N-terminal domain (NTD). This structural motif is shared with other family members, such as ApoL1, and is characterized by a unique four-helix core that differs from classical four-helix bundles and other known protein structures (Ultsch2021Structures). The NTD of APOL2, specifically residues S6-S61, forms a complex with the Fab6D12 antibody, and its structure is nearly identical to that of ApoL1, indicating a conserved structural motif across the ApoL family (Ultsch2021Structures).

The BH3-like region of APOL2, similar to that of ApoL1, does not bind to pro-survival Bcl-2 family proteins, suggesting a noncanonical function in cell death pathways (Ultsch2021Structures). APOL2 is upregulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, hinting at a role in immune-related functions (Ultsch2021Structures). The protein is expressed in Sf9 insect cells and purified for structural studies, with crystallization achieved in complex with Fab6D12 (Ultsch2021Structures). The structural insights into APOL2 suggest potential roles in immune defense, although specific post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms are not detailed in the available context.

## Function
APOL2, a member of the apolipoprotein L family, is involved in several cellular processes, primarily related to lipid transport and cellular stress responses. In healthy human cells, APOL2 is associated with the regulation of autophagy, a process crucial for cellular homeostasis and the degradation of damaged organelles and proteins. It is suggested to trigger non-apoptotic autophagy, which may protect epithelial and endothelial cells from inflammation or hypoxia-related cytotoxicity (Pays2020The). APOL2 is also implicated in the cellular response to inflammatory cytokines, where its expression is upregulated via the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. This upregulation is linked to increased expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related genes, indicating a role in managing ER stress (PazBarba2023Apolipoprotein).

APOL2 is active in the cytoplasm and is associated with the Golgi and mitochondrial membranes, particularly at mitochondrial-ER contact sites (MERCs). These locations suggest its involvement in mitochondrial dynamics, including fission and autophagy (Pays2020The). While its specific functions in healthy cells are not fully detailed, APOL2's role in lipid transport and cellular stress responses highlights its importance in maintaining cellular integrity and function.

## Clinical Significance
APOL2 (apolipoprotein L2) is implicated in several diseases due to its role in lipid transport and immune response. Alterations in APOL2 expression or mutations can contribute to cancer progression and metastasis. The gene's involvement in cancer is linked to its influence on cellular stress responses and inflammation, which are critical in tumor development and spread. Changes in APOL2 expression levels may affect the tumor microenvironment, potentially promoting cancer cell survival and dissemination.

In addition to cancer, APOL2 is associated with neurodegenerative disorders. Its role in these conditions is thought to be related to its impact on cellular stress responses, which are crucial in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. The gene's involvement in lipid transport and immune response may also play a part in the progression of these disorders.

APOL2 is also linked to cardiovascular diseases. Alterations in its expression or function can influence inflammation and lipid metabolism, both of which are key factors in cardiovascular health. The gene's role in these processes suggests that it may contribute to the development or exacerbation of cardiovascular conditions by affecting the body's ability to manage stress and inflammation.

## Interactions
Apolipoprotein L2 (ApoL2) is characterized by a BH3-like domain, yet it does not function as a typical BH3-only protein, which are generally involved in proapoptotic activities. Despite its structural similarity to other BH3-only proteins, ApoL2 does not induce apoptosis or regulate autophagy in HeLa cells. It has been shown to interact weakly with Bcl-2, a member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, which are known for their roles in regulating apoptosis. However, this interaction does not significantly influence apoptosis or autophagy, as evidenced by the lack of effect on cell death or autophagic flux when ApoL2 is downregulated (GalindoMoreno2014Apolipoprotein).

Structural studies have revealed that ApoL2 shares a non-classical four-helix bundle motif with other members of the ApoL family, such as ApoL1. This motif does not facilitate binding to pro-survival Bcl-2 family proteins, further supporting the notion that ApoL2 does not engage in typical BH3-only protein interactions (Ultsch2021Structures). Despite these findings, the precise role of ApoL2 in cellular processes remains unclear, and no specific interactions with nucleic acids have been detailed in the available studies.
