# PPP1R27

## Overview
The PPP1R27 gene encodes the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 27, which is a regulatory protein involved in modulating the activity of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). PP1 is a serine/threonine phosphatase that plays a critical role in various cellular processes, including cell division, protein synthesis, and neuronal signaling. As a regulatory subunit, PPP1R27 influences the specificity and function of PP1 by directing it to particular substrates or cellular locations. This gene has been studied in the context of neurological disorders and cancer, with mutations and expression changes in PPP1R27 being linked to conditions such as epilepsy and lung squamous cell carcinoma (Preeprem2014SDS; Jiang2022Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
The PPP1R27 gene has been implicated in several clinical contexts, particularly in relation to epilepsy and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). In the context of epilepsy, the Ile112Met mutation in PPP1R27 is predicted to destabilize the protein due to steric clashes, potentially affecting protein function. Although this mutation is favorable for general protein folding, its structural disruption may have implications for epilepsy, as PPP1R27 is related to protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which is involved in the long-term potentiation pathway linked to epileptogenesis (Preeprem2014SDS). The gene has been identified as likely to harbor mutations that promote epilepsy, suggesting its potential role in the condition (Preeprem2014SDS).

In lung squamous cell carcinoma, PPP1R27 is part of an eight-gene prognostic signature used to predict survival outcomes. It is upregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, indicating its involvement in cancer progression and prognosis (Jiang2022Characterization). The gene's expression level is associated with overall survival, highlighting its potential as a prognostic tool in LUSC (Jiang2022Characterization). These findings suggest that alterations in PPP1R27 expression or mutations may contribute to disease mechanisms in both epilepsy and cancer.
