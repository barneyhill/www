# DHX30

## Overview
The DHX30 gene encodes the DExH-box helicase 30, a member of the DExH-box family of RNA helicases, which are characterized by their role in ATP-dependent unwinding of RNA structures. This protein is integral to various cellular processes, including RNA metabolism, splicing, ribosome biogenesis, and translation regulation. DHX30 is active in both the cytoplasm and mitochondria, where it influences mitochondrial translation and energy metabolism, highlighting its importance in cellular homeostasis and stress response (Bosco2020DHX30; Lessel2017De). Mutations in the DHX30 gene have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, underscoring the protein's critical role in normal neurological function (Mannucci2021Genotype–phenotype).

## Structure
The DHX30 protein is a member of the DExH-box helicase family, characterized by a conserved helicase core region. This core contains eight highly conserved motifs essential for its function, including ATP binding, hydrolysis, and RNA binding (Mannucci2021Genotype–phenotype; Lessel2017De). The helicase core is composed of two domains, RecA-1 and RecA-2, which are structurally similar to the bacterial recombination protein recombinase A (Mannucci2021Genotype–phenotype). These domains form a cleft that facilitates NTP binding and hydrolysis, crucial for the helicase's activity (1 page 2 of 34).

The primary structure of DHX30 includes motifs such as Ia, II, and VI, which are involved in RNA binding and ATP hydrolysis (Lessel2017De). The secondary structure likely involves alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of helicase proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure is expected to be a compact, globular shape, facilitating interactions with RNA and other proteins. The quaternary structure may involve interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids, although specific details are not mentioned in the context.

DHX30 is also involved in mitochondrial RNA metabolism and translation, indicating its role in cellular processes beyond RNA unwinding (1 page 2 of 34). The protein's function is critical, as evidenced by its intolerance to missense mutations, which can lead to neurodevelopmental disorders (Lessel2017De).

## Function
The DHX30 gene encodes an ATP-dependent RNA helicase that plays a crucial role in RNA metabolism, including RNA splicing, ribosome biogenesis, and translation regulation. In healthy human cells, DHX30 functions as an RNA-dependent ATPase, essential for unwinding RNA secondary structures, which is vital for RNA synthesis, processing, export, translation, and decay (Lessel2017De). The protein is involved in RNA binding and is associated with specific mRNAs, indicating its role in RNA metabolism (Lessel2017De).

DHX30 is active in both the cytoplasm and mitochondria, where it coordinates cytoplasmic translation and mitochondrial function. It influences the expression of mitochondrially encoded genes and interacts with mitoribosome transcripts, modulating mitochondrial translation (Bosco2020DHX30). The protein's localization to mitochondria suggests its involvement in mitochondrial respiration and energy metabolism (Bosco2021DHX30).

In terms of cellular stress response, DHX30 is recruited to stress granules, cytoplasmic aggregates that form in response to stress, playing a role in maintaining normal cellular stress responses and protein synthesis (Mannucci2021Genotype–phenotype). Overall, DHX30 is integral to maintaining cellular homeostasis and fitness, impacting organismal development and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DHX30 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders. These include global developmental delay (GDD), intellectual disability (ID), severe speech impairment, and gait abnormalities. Six different de novo missense mutations in DHX30 have been identified in twelve unrelated individuals, leading to these conditions. These mutations affect highly conserved helicase motifs, impairing ATPase activity or RNA recognition, which results in increased stress granule formation and global translation inhibition (Mannucci2021Genotype–phenotype; Lessel2017De).

The clinical spectrum of disorders associated with DHX30 mutations includes delayed motor development, muscular hypotonia, feeding difficulties, microcephaly, joint hypermobility, structural brain anomalies, sleep disturbances, strabismus, autistic features, and seizures. Some individuals exhibit milder symptoms, such as moderate intellectual disability and the ability to walk and speak simple sentences (Mannucci2021Genotype–phenotype).

DHX30 mutations have also been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, particularly in the context of ALS-FUS pathogenesis. Mutations in FUS can lead to structural and functional defects in DHX30, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction and cytotoxicity, contributing to neurodegeneration in ALS-FUS (Hikiami2022Conformational). These findings highlight the critical role of DHX30 in maintaining normal neurological function and its involvement in various neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders.

## Interactions
DHX30, a member of the DExH-box helicase family, is involved in several critical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It interacts with the zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP), which is essential for ZAP's antiviral activity. This interaction occurs through the N-terminal domains of both proteins and is crucial for the degradation of viral mRNA, a key component of the host's antiviral response. The interaction between DHX30 and ZAP has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays, and it appears to be both RNA-dependent and RNA-independent (Ye2010DEXHBox).

DHX30 also interacts with the FUS protein, particularly in the context of ALS-associated mutations. This interaction is RNA-dependent and occurs in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. In the presence of the FUS P525L mutation, DHX30 colocalizes with FUS aggregates, suggesting a role in aggregate formation. This interaction is observed in both mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions, indicating DHX30's involvement in mitochondrial function and cytosolic aggregate formation (Hikiami2022Conformational).

In cancer cells, DHX30 binds to ribosomal and mitoribosomal protein transcripts, influencing ribosome biogenesis and translation efficiency. It is associated with ribosomal subunits, 80S monosomes, and light polysomes, highlighting its role in translation processes (Bosco2021DHX30).
