# FAM200B

## Overview
FAM200B is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 200 member B. This protein is implicated in various biological processes and is categorized as a non-enzymatic protein, with its precise functional roles still under investigation. The FAM200B gene has garnered attention due to its involvement in several diseases, including neurodevelopmental disorders and Parkinson's Disease, where alterations in its expression have been observed (Coe2018Neurodevelopmental; Gokuladhas2024Discovering). Additionally, FAM200B has been identified in cancer research, with somatic mutations noted in breast cancer and upregulation in acute myeloid leukemia in response to epigenetic treatments (Asmaa2020Transcriptomic; Chang2020Pathway). These associations suggest that FAM200B may serve as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target, although further studies are required to fully understand its biological and clinical significance.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the FAM200B gene have been implicated in several diseases. In neurodevelopmental disorders, FAM200B is identified as an outlier in the denovolyzeR model for likely gene-disruptive mutations, suggesting a significant role in conditions such as developmental delay and autism spectrum disorder (Coe2018Neurodevelopmental). In Parkinson's Disease (PD), down-regulation of FAM200B in the brain cortex is associated with an increased odds ratio for the disease, indicating that changes in its expression may contribute to PD development or progression (Gokuladhas2024Discovering). 

In the context of cancer, FAM200B is among the genes with somatic mutations identified in breast cancer, although the specific clinical significance of these mutations is not detailed (Chang2020Pathway). In acute myeloid leukemia, FAM200B is one of the genes upregulated in response to epigenetic treatments, suggesting its involvement in the pathogenesis of this cancer type (Asmaa2020Transcriptomic). These findings highlight the potential of FAM200B as a biomarker and its involvement in various pathological conditions, although further research is needed to fully elucidate its clinical implications.
