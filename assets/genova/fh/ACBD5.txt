# ACBD5

## Overview
ACBD5 is a gene that encodes the protein acyl-CoA binding domain containing 5, which is a peroxisomal membrane protein involved in lipid metabolism. The protein is characterized by its acyl-CoA binding domain, which facilitates the binding of long-chain acyl-CoAs, and a transmembrane domain that anchors it to the peroxisomal membrane. ACBD5 plays a critical role in tethering peroxisomes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through interactions with ER-resident VAP proteins, thereby facilitating lipid exchange and maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis (Hua2017VAPs; Costello2017ACBD5). The protein's function is regulated by phosphorylation, which modulates its interaction with VAP proteins and affects peroxisome-ER membrane contacts (Kors2021Regulating). Mutations in the ACBD5 gene are linked to a peroxisomal disorder characterized by retinal dystrophy and leukodystrophy, highlighting its clinical significance in human health (Ferdinandusse2016ACBD5; Bartlett2021First).

## Structure
ACBD5 is a peroxisomal membrane protein characterized by several structural features that facilitate its role in lipid metabolism. It contains a highly conserved acyl-CoA binding (ACB) domain, which is essential for binding long-chain acyl-CoAs (Kors2024New). The protein also includes a coiled-coil region, which is common in mediating protein-protein interactions, and a transmembrane domain (TMD) with positively charged amino acids at the C-terminus, anchoring it to the peroxisomal membrane (Kors2024New; Wang2018Intracellular).

ACBD5 features a FFAT motif, crucial for its interaction with ER-resident VAP proteins, facilitating peroxisome-ER contact sites. This motif is characterized by a conserved negatively charged SDSDS acidic tract sequence preceding the hydrophobic core residues (Kors2024New). Phosphorylation plays a significant role in regulating ACBD5's interactions, particularly with VAPB. Phosphorylation of serine residues within the acidic tract enhances binding, while phosphorylation at S269 by GSK3β negatively regulates the interaction (Kors2021Regulating).

The tertiary structure of ACBD5 is implied by the presence of these domains, although specific details on its primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures are not explicitly provided in the available literature (Kors2024New; Darwisch2020Cerebellar).

## Function
ACBD5 is a peroxisomal membrane protein that plays a crucial role in tethering peroxisomes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through its interaction with ER-resident VAP proteins. This tethering is essential for maintaining peroxisome positioning and mobility within the cell, as well as for facilitating lipid exchange between the ER and peroxisomes (Hua2017VAPs; Costello2017ACBD5). The VAP-ACBD5 interaction is necessary for the biosynthesis and transport of specific lipids, such as plasmalogens and cholesterol, which are critical for lipid homeostasis (Hua2017VAPs). 

ACBD5 is involved in the transport of lipids from the ER to peroxisomes, which is required for peroxisome membrane expansion and elongation (Hua2017VAPs; Costello2017ACBD5). The protein is anchored in the peroxisomal membrane and interacts with activated fatty acids, indicating its role in lipid metabolism, including the biosynthesis of ether phospholipids and polyunsaturated fatty acids (Costello2017ACBD5). Disruption of the ACBD5-VAP interaction can lead to increased peroxisome mobility and perturbations in lipid metabolism, which may contribute to neuropathological disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Hua2017VAPs; Costello2017ACBD5).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ACBD5 gene are associated with a peroxisomal disorder known as ACBD5-related retinal dystrophy with leukodystrophy (RDLKD). This condition is characterized by vision impairment, developmental regression, and spastic paraplegia. Patients with ACBD5 mutations often experience progressive visual and motor deterioration, including symptoms such as nystagmus, visual acuity loss, developmental regression, and weakness in the extremities. Severe dysarthria, cognitive impairments, and neurogenic bladder issues are also reported (Bartlett2021First).

ACBD5 deficiency leads to a defect in peroxisomal very long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) metabolism, resulting in the accumulation of VLCFAs due to impaired peroxisomal beta-oxidation. This metabolic disruption is linked to clinical symptoms such as progressive leukodystrophy, ataxia, retinal dystrophy, cleft palate, and facial dysmorphism. The condition resembles ACOX1 deficiency but differs from X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) (Ferdinandusse2016ACBD5).

The deficiency is categorized as a novel single peroxisomal enzyme deficiency, distinct from peroxisome biogenesis disorders, which affect multiple metabolic pathways. ACBD5 deficiency should be considered in the differential diagnosis of peroxisomal disorders with abnormal VLCFA profiles (Ferdinandusse2016ACBD5).

## Interactions
ACBD5 interacts with the ER-resident protein VAPB to form a tether between peroxisomes and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This interaction is mediated by the FFAT-like motif in ACBD5, which binds to the major sperm protein (MSP) domain of VAPB. This binding is crucial for maintaining peroxisome-ER associations, facilitating lipid transfer, and supporting peroxisomal membrane expansion and motility (Hua2017VAPs; Costello2017ACBD5). 

The interaction between ACBD5 and VAPB is regulated by phosphorylation. The kinase GSK3β phosphorylates serine at position 269 (S269) on ACBD5, which inhibits its binding to VAPB. This phosphorylation event modulates peroxisome-ER membrane contacts, highlighting the role of phosphorylation in regulating ACBD5-VAPB interactions (Kors2021Regulating).

ACBD5 also interacts with VAPA, another ER-resident protein similar to VAPB, suggesting a broader role in ER-peroxisome tethering (Hua2017VAPs). These interactions are essential for lipid homeostasis and peroxisome maintenance, with implications for cellular processes such as lipid metabolism and organelle biogenesis (Hua2017VAPs; Costello2017ACBD5).
