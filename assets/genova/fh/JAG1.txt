# JAG1

## Overview
JAG1 is a gene located on chromosome 20 that encodes the protein jagged canonical Notch ligand 1, a type I transmembrane protein integral to the Notch signaling pathway. This pathway is a critical cell communication mechanism that regulates cell fate, differentiation, and proliferation. The JAG1 protein features a large extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a small intracellular domain, with the extracellular portion containing a DSL (Delta/Serrate/Lag-2) domain and multiple epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats. These structural elements are essential for its interaction with Notch receptors, facilitating the activation of downstream signaling cascades. JAG1 plays a pivotal role in the development and function of various tissues, including the heart, kidney, and vascular system, and is implicated in several pathological conditions. Mutations in the JAG1 gene are primarily associated with Alagille syndrome, a multisystem developmental disorder, and have also been linked to certain cardiac anomalies and cancers (Spinner2000Jagged1; Grochowski2016Jagged1; Bauer2010Jagged1).

## Structure
The JAG1 protein is a type I transmembrane protein involved in the Notch signaling pathway. It is encoded by the JAG1 gene, which spans 26 exons and is located on chromosome 20 at cytogenetic location 20p12.2 (Grochowski2016Jagged1). The protein consists of 1218 amino acids and features a large extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a relatively small intracellular domain (Spinner2000Jagged1; Grochowski2016Jagged1).

The extracellular region of JAG1 includes a 21-amino acid signal peptide, a 40-amino acid DSL (Delta/Serrate/Lag-2) domain, and 16 epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats, followed by a cysteine-rich region (Spinner2000Jagged1; Grochowski2016Jagged1). The EGF-like repeats contain six conserved cysteine residues that form disulfide bridges, crucial for protein stabilization (Spinner2000Jagged1). The DSL domain is essential for binding to Notch receptors, while the EGF repeats, particularly the first and second, enhance the affinity of JAG1 to these receptors (Grochowski2016Jagged1; Shimizu1999Mouse).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are important for JAG1's function, influencing its interaction with Notch receptors (Spinner2000Jagged1). The protein also has several splice variant isoforms, which may affect its functional properties (Spinner2000Jagged1).

## Function
JAG1 (jagged canonical Notch ligand 1) is a crucial component of the Notch signaling pathway, a fundamental mechanism for cell communication that influences cell fate determination, differentiation, and proliferation. JAG1 functions as a ligand that binds to Notch receptors on adjacent cells, initiating a series of proteolytic cleavages that release the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). This domain translocates to the nucleus, where it interacts with transcription factors to regulate the expression of target genes (Grochowski2016Jagged1; Bauer2010Jagged1).

In healthy human cells, JAG1 is involved in the development and function of various tissues and organs, including the heart, kidney, eye, and lung. It plays a significant role in the differentiation of basal cells into secretory cells in the human airway epithelium, without affecting ciliated cell differentiation (Gomi2016JAG1Mediated). JAG1 is also essential for vascular development, particularly in angiogenic remodeling during embryogenesis (Xue1999Embryonic).

Structurally, JAG1 is located on chromosome 20 and consists of a large extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a small intracellular portion. The extracellular domain includes a DSL (Delta/Serrate/Lag-2) domain and EGF-like repeats, which are critical for binding to Notch receptors and enhancing binding affinity (Spinner2000Jagged1; Grochowski2016Jagged1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the JAG1 gene are primarily associated with Alagille syndrome (AGS), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by developmental abnormalities in multiple organ systems, including the liver, heart, skeleton, eyes, and face. AGS is often diagnosed based on the presence of interlobular bile duct paucity and at least three of five major features: chronic cholestasis, cardiac disease, skeletal abnormalities, ocular abnormalities, and a characteristic facial phenotype (Bauer2010Jagged1; Kamath2003Consequences). Mutations in JAG1 can include full gene deletions, nonsense, frameshift, splice site, and missense mutations, leading to haploinsufficiency (Grochowski2016Jagged1). These mutations are found in 60-75% of patients with a clinically confirmed diagnosis of AGS (Spinner2000Jagged1).

Beyond AGS, JAG1 mutations have been linked to cardiac conditions such as Tetralogy of Fallot and pulmonary stenosis, even in individuals who do not meet the clinical criteria for AGS (Bauer2010Jagged1). Altered expression of JAG1 is also associated with various cancers, including breast, brain, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers. High levels of JAG1 mRNA and protein are markers for poor outcomes in breast cancer and may enhance tumor aggressiveness in adrenocortical carcinoma (Grochowski2016Jagged1).

## Interactions
JAG1 (Jagged1) is a cell surface ligand that plays a crucial role in the Notch signaling pathway by interacting with Notch receptors, particularly NOTCH1 and NOTCH2. This interaction involves the binding of JAG1's extracellular domain, which includes a DSL domain and multiple EGF-like repeats, to the Notch receptors. The DSL domain is essential for binding, while the EGF-like repeats, especially repeats 1 and 2, enhance the affinity of JAG1 for the receptors (Spinner2000Jagged1; Grochowski2016Jagged1).

Mutations in JAG1 can affect its ability to localize to the cell surface and interact with Notch receptors. For instance, the p.C234Y and p.P810L mutations lead to improper glycosylation and intracellular retention, impairing their interaction with Notch receptors. In contrast, the p.R937Q variant maintains proper cell surface localization and interaction, functioning similarly to the wild-type JAG1 (Bauer2010Jagged1).

JAG1's interaction with Notch receptors is critical for the activation of the Notch signaling pathway, which influences cell fate decisions during development. This interaction is also involved in the formation of multiprotein complexes that trigger intracellular signaling cascades (Spinner2000Jagged1; Xu2023Jag1Notch).
